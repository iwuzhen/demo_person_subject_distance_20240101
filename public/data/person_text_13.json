He used it in 1798 in the title of his Inquiry into the Variolae vaccinae known as the Cow Pox, in which he described the protective effect of cowpox against smallpox.[4]/nIn the West, Jenner is often called \"the father of immunology\",[5] and his work is said to have saved \"more lives than any other man\".[6]:\u200a100\u200a[7] In Jenner's time, smallpox killed around 10% of global population, with the number as high as 20% in towns and cities where infection spread more easily.[7] In 1821, he was appointed physician to King George IV, and was also made mayor of Berkeley and justice of the peace. He was a member of the Royal Society. In the field of zoology, he was among the first modern scholars to describe the brood parasitism of the cuckoo (Aristotle also noted this behaviour in his History of Animals). In 2002, Jenner was named in the BBC's list of the 100 Greatest Britons./nEdward Jenner was born on 17 May 1749[8] in Berkeley, Gloucestershire, England as the eighth of nine children. His father, the Reverend Stephen Jenner, was the vicar of Berkeley, so Jenner received a strong basic education.[8]/nWhen he was young, he went to school in Wotton-under-Edge at Katherine Lady Berkeley's School and in Cirencester.[8] During this time, he was inoculated (by variolation) for smallpox, which had a lifelong effect upon his general health.[8] At the age of 14, he was apprenticed for seven years to Daniel Ludlow, a surgeon of Chipping Sodbury, South Gloucestershire, where he gained most of the experience needed to become a surgeon himself.[8]/nIn 1770, aged 21, Jenner became apprenticed in surgery and anatomy under surgeon John Hunter and others at St George's Hospital, London.[9] William Osler records that Hunter gave Jenner William Harvey's advice, well known in medical circles (and characteristic of the Age of Enlightenment), \"Don't think; try.\"[10] Hunter remained in correspondence with Jenner over natural history and proposed him for the Royal Society. Returning to his native countryside by 1773, Jenner became a successful family doctor and surgeon, practising on dedicated premises at Berkeley. In 1792, \"with twenty years' experience of general practice and surgery, Jenner obtained the degree of MD from the University of St Andrews\".[3]/nJenner and others formed the Fleece Medical Society or Gloucestershire Medical Society, so called because it met in the parlour of the Fleece Inn, Rodborough, Gloucestershire. Members dined together and read papers on medical subjects. Jenner contributed papers on angina pectoris, ophthalmia, and cardiac valvular disease and commented on cowpox. He also belonged to a similar society which met in Alveston, near Bristol.[11]/nHe became a master mason on  30 December 1802, in Lodge of Faith and Friendship #449. From 1812 to 1813, he served as worshipful master of Royal Berkeley Lodge of Faith and Friendship.[12]/nJenner was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1788, following his publication of a careful study of the previously misunderstood life of the nested cuckoo, a study that combined observation, experiment, and dissection./nJenner described how the newly hatched cuckoo pushed its host's eggs and fledgling chicks out of the nest (contrary to existing belief that the adult cuckoo did it).[13] Having observed this behaviour, Jenner demonstrated an anatomical adaptation for it\u00a0\u2013 the baby cuckoo has a depression in its back, not present after 12 days of life, that enables it to cup eggs and other chicks. The adult does not remain long enough in the area to perform this task. Jenner's findings were published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1788.[14][15]/n\"The singularity of its shape is well adapted to these purposes; for, different from other newly hatched birds, its back from the scapula downwards is very broad, with a considerable depression in the middle. This depression seems formed by nature for the design of giving a more secure lodgement to the egg of the Hedge-sparrow, or its young one, when the young Cuckoo is employed in removing either of them from the nest. When it is about twelve days old, this cavity is quite filled up, and then the back assumes the shape of nestling birds in general.\"[16] Jenner's nephew assisted in the study. He was born on 30 June 1737./nJenner's understanding of the cuckoo's behaviour was not entirely believed until the artist Jemima Blackburn, a keen observer of birdlife, saw a blind nestling pushing out a host's egg. Blackburn's description and illustration were enough to convince Charles Darwin to revise a later edition of On the Origin of Species.[17]/nJenner's interest in zoology played a large role in his first experiment with inoculation. Not only did he have a profound understanding of human anatomy due to his medical training, but he also understood animal biology and its role in human-animal trans-species boundaries in disease transmission.  At the time, there was no way of knowing how important this connection would be to the history and discovery of vaccinations.  We see this connection now; many present-day vaccinations include animal parts from cows, rabbits, and chicken eggs, which can be attributed to the work of Jenner and his cowpox/smallpox vaccination.[18]/nJenner married Catherine Kingscote (who died in 1815 from tuberculosis) in March 1788. He might have met her while he and other fellows were experimenting with balloons. Jenner's trial balloon descended into Kingscote Park, Gloucestershire, owned by Catherine's father Anthony Kingscote.[19] They had three children: Edward Robert (1789\u20131810), Robert Fitzharding (1792\u20131854) and Catherine (1794\u20131833).[20]/nHe earned his MD from the University of St Andrews in 1792.[21] He is credited with advancing the understanding of angina pectoris.[22] In his correspondence with Heberden, he wrote: \"How much the heart must suffer from the coronary arteries not being able to perform their functions\".[23]/nInoculation was already a standard practice in Asian and African medicine but involved serious risks, including the possibility that those inoculated would become contagious and spread the disease to others.[24] In 1721, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu had imported variolation to Britain after having observed it in Istanbul. While Johnnie Notions had great success with his self-devised inoculation[25] (and was reputed not to have lost a single patient),[26] his method's practice was limited to the Shetland Isles. Voltaire wrote that at this time 60% of the population caught smallpox and 20% of the population died from it.[27] Voltaire also states that the Circassians used the inoculation from times immemorial, and the custom may have been borrowed by the Turks from the Circassians.[28] In 1766, Daniel Bernoulli analysed smallpox morbidity and mortality data to demonstrate the efficacy of inoculation.[29]/nBy 1768, English physician John Fewster had realised that prior infection with cowpox rendered a person immune to smallpox.[30][31] In the years following 1770, at least five investigators in England and Germany (Sevel, Jensen, Jesty 1774, Rendell, Plett 1791) successfully tested in humans a cowpox vaccine against smallpox.[32] For example, Dorset farmer Benjamin Jesty[33] successfully vaccinated and presumably induced immunity with cowpox in his wife and two children during a smallpox epidemic in 1774, but it was not until Jenner's work that the procedure became widely understood. Jenner may have been aware of Jesty's procedures and success.[34]  A similar observation was later made in France by Jacques Antoine Rabaut-Pommier in 1780.[35]/nJenner postulated that the pus in the blisters that affected individuals affected by cowpox (a disease similar to smallpox, but much less virulent) protected them from smallpox. On 14 May 1796, Jenner tested his hypothesis by inoculating James Phipps, an eight-year-old boy who was the son of Jenner's gardener. He scraped pus from cowpox blisters on the hands of Sarah Nelmes, a milkmaid who had caught cowpox from a cow called Blossom,[36] whose hide now hangs on the wall of the St. George's Medical School library (now in Tooting). Phipps was the 17th case described in Jenner's first paper on vaccination.[37]/nJenner inoculated Phipps in both arms that day, subsequently producing in Phipps a fever and some uneasiness, but no full-blown infection. Later, he injected Phipps with variolous material, the routine method of immunization at that time. No disease followed. The boy was later challenged with variolous material and again showed no sign of infection.  No unexpected side effects occurred, and neither Phipps nor any other recipients underwent any future 'breakthrough' cases./nJenner's biographer John Baron would later speculate that Jenner understood one could be inoculated against smallpox by being exposed to cowpox by observing the unblemished complexion of milkmaids, rather than building on the work of his predecessors. The milkmaids story is still widely repeated even though it appears to be a myth.[38][39]/nDonald Hopkins has written, \"Jenner's unique contribution was not that he inoculated a few persons with cowpox, but that he then proved [by subsequent challenges] that they were immune to smallpox. Moreover, he demonstrated that the protective cowpox pus could be effectively inoculated from person to person, not just directly from cattle.\"[40] Jenner successfully tested his hypothesis on 23 additional subjects./nJenner continued his research and reported it to the Royal Society, which did not publish the initial paper. After revisions and further investigations, he published his findings on the 23 cases, including his 11-month-old son Robert.[41] Some of his conclusions were correct, some erroneous; modern microbiological and microscopic methods would make his studies easier to reproduce. The medical establishment deliberated at length over his findings before accepting them. Eventually, vaccination was accepted, and in 1840, the British government banned variolation\u00a0\u2013 the use of smallpox to induce immunity\u00a0\u2013 and provided vaccination using cowpox free of charge (see Vaccination Act)./nThe success of his discovery soon spread around Europe and was used en masse in the Spanish Balmis Expedition (1803\u20131806), a three-year-long mission to the Americas, the Philippines, Macao, China, led by Francisco Javier de Balmis with the aim of giving thousands the smallpox vaccine.[42] The expedition was successful, and Jenner wrote: \"I don't imagine the annals of history furnish an example of philanthropy so noble, so extensive as this\".[43] Napoleon, who at the time was at war with Britain, had all his French troops vaccinated, awarded Jenner a medal, and at the request of Jenner, he released two English prisoners of war and permitted their return home.[44][45] Napoleon remarked he could not \"refuse anything to one of the greatest benefactors of mankind\".[44]/nJenner's continuing work on vaccination prevented him from continuing his ordinary medical practice. He was supported by his colleagues and the King in petitioning Parliament,[46] and was granted \u00a310,000 in 1802 for his work on vaccination.[47] In 1807, he was granted another \u00a320,000 after the Royal College of Physicians confirmed the widespread efficacy of vaccination.[3]/nJenner was later elected a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1802, a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1804,[48] and a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1806.[49]  In 1803 in London, he became president of the Jennerian Society, concerned with promoting vaccination to eradicate smallpox. The Jennerian ceased operations in 1809. Jenner became a member of the Medical and Chirurgical Society on its founding in 1805 (now the Royal Society of Medicine) and presented several papers there.  In 1808, with government aid, the National Vaccine Establishment was founded, but Jenner felt dishonoured by the men selected to run it and resigned his directorship.[6]:\u200a122\u2013125/nReturning to London in 1811, Jenner observed a significant number of cases of smallpox after vaccination. He found that in these cases the severity of the illness was notably diminished by previous vaccination. In 1821, he was appointed physician extraordinary to King George IV, and was also made mayor of Berkeley[3] and magistrate[6]:\u200a303\u200a (justice of the peace). He continued to investigate natural history, and in 1823, the last year of his life, he presented his \"Observations on the Migration of Birds\" to the Royal Society.[47]/nJenner was a Freemason.[50][51]/nJenner was found in a state of apoplexy on 25 January 1823, with his right side paralysed.[6]:\u200a314\u200a He did not recover and died the next day of an apparent stroke, his second, on 26 January 1823,[6] aged 73. He was buried in the family vault at the Church of St Mary, Berkeley.[52]/nNeither fanatic nor lax,[53] Jenner was a Christian who in his personal correspondence showed himself quite spiritual.[6]:\u200a141\u200a Some days before his death, he stated to a friend: \"I am not surprised that men are not grateful to me; but I wonder that they are not grateful to God for the good which He has made me the instrument of conveying to my fellow creatures\".[6]:\u200a295/nIn 1980, the World Health Organization declared smallpox an eradicated disease.[54] This was the result of coordinated public health efforts, but vaccination was an essential component. Although the disease was declared eradicated, some pus samples still remain in laboratories in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta in the US, and in State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR in Koltsovo, Novosibirsk Oblast, Russia.[55]/nJenner's vaccine laid the foundation for contemporary discoveries in immunology.[56] In 2002, Jenner was named in the BBC's list of the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote.[57] Commemorated on postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail, in 1999 he featured in their World Changers issue along with Charles Darwin, Michael Faraday and Alan Turing.[58] The lunar crater Jenner is named in his honour.[59]", "71673145": "Laura Guzm\u00e1n D\u00e1valos (born 1961) is a Mexican mycologist, biologist and lichenologist.

He studied zoology at Worcester College at University of Oxford and also earned his PhD from there in 1967. His PhD project (1964-67) on the behavior and evolution of treeshrews (Tupaiidae) was based on research with Konrad Lorenz and Iren\u00e4us Eibl-Eibesfeldt (Max-Planck-Institut, Seewiesen), supervised by Nikolaas Tinbergen (University of Oxford). Treeshrews were, at the time, widely thought to be the most primitive living primates. Through his study on their maternal behavior and later through studies of their brains, he concluded in his PhD thesis that treeshrews are not close relatives of primates.[3]/nImmediately after his PhD, Martin received a NATO postdoctoral grant (1967\u201369) to work with J.J. Petter and A. Petter-Rousseaux (Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Brunoy) to study the reproductive biology of mouse lemurs while continuing his work on primate morphology. Afterwards, he received a lecturer position in biological anthropology at University College London (1969\u201374), where he continued his research on the reproduction of mouse lemurs and comparative work on morphology of the skull, brain, postcranial skeleton and reproductive system in primates. In 1974, Martin became a senior research fellow at the Wellcome Laboratories at the Zoological Society of London, where he coordinated research on mammalian reproduction. In 1975, he spent a semester at Yale University as visiting professor in the Department of Anthropology. Martin then returned to University College London, first as reader (1978\u201382) and then as professor (1982\u201386) in biological anthropology, during which his research became focused on allometric scaling, particularly regarding the brain. In 1986, he became the director and professor of the Anthropological Institute at the University of Zurich in Switzerland, where he started a range of research activities. In 2001, Martin accepted an appointment at The Field Museum, first as vice president and then as provost for Academic Affairs while holding the position as curator in the Department of Anthropology. In 2006, he stepped down from his administrative role and became the A. Watson Armour III Curator of Biology Anthropology. He became emeritus curator at the end of 2013./nMartin's research uses a wide range of approaches to identify reliable general principles in human evolution. In order to interpret human origins, he has conducted comprehensive comparisons across primates with studies that cover anatomy of both living and fossil representatives, ecology, behaviour, reproduction and molecular evolution. Throughout his research, the study of size relationships (allometric scaling or allometry) has been a prevalent theme. His synthetic approach to primate evolution has revealed a number of important relationships. This was exemplified in a study by Martin and colleagues on times of divergence in the primate tree, notably the split between humans and chimpanzees. Because of major gaps in the fossil record, estimation of divergence times from earliest known fossil relatives can be misleading. So they used statistical analyses of living and fossil primates in combination with an evolutionary tree based on DNA evidence, which revealed that divergence times within the primate tree are generally substantially earlier than has often been claimed. Specifically, the divergence between humans and chimpanzees  \u2014  which was to be around 5 million years ago  \u2014  appears to be closer to 8 million years ago.[4] Another example is provided by the connection between brain size and reproductive biology. By examining these features together, Martin and colleagues inferred that maternal energy resources played a vital part in the evolution of the brain. The resulting \"Maternal Energy Hypothesis\" is particularly relevant to interpreting the evolution of the very large brain of humans.[5][6][7]/nMartin has over 300 publications, including peer-reviewed papers, books, book chapters, and book translations.

Ernst was a botanist, zoologist, metallurgist, chemist, geographer, travel writer, novelist, duellist, art collector and trailblazer in ethnopsychopharmacology./nErnst's father, Ferdinand Johann von Bibra, (*1756; \u2020 1807), fought under General Rochambeau in the American Revolutionary War on behalf of the colonies. Later he married his brother's daughter, Lucretia Wilhelmine Caroline von Bibra,(b.1778 - d. + 1857).  Ernst's father died when he was 1\u00bd years old, and Baron Christoph Franz von Hutten (d. 1830) raised Ernst in W\u00fcrzburg.  He graduated at nineteen from a boarding school in Neuberg on the Danube. Baron Ernst von Bibra started studying law at W\u00fcrzburg but soon changed over to the natural sciences, especially chemistry. (\"Dr. med. & phil.\" Doctor of Medicine & PhD) Martin Haseneier, in his foreword to the 1995 translation Plant Intoxicants relates that Ernst fought in no less than 49 duels as a young man! Many of his works have been reprinted in recent years.  Besides the castle and estate at Schwebheim, Ernst was the owner of a half interest in the castle and estate at Willershausen (Herleshausen). Ernst sold his half of the castle and estate of Willershausen (Herleshausen) in 1850 to the Landgrave Carl August of Hesse./nHe produced: Chemical Research on Various Varieties of Pus (Berlin 1842); Chemical Research on the Bones and Teeth of Humans and Other Vertebrates (Schweinfurt 1844) and Helpful Tables for the Recognition of the Substances of Zoological Chemistry (Erlangen 1846). Then in cooperation with Geist he published: Investigations of the Diseases of the Workers in the Phosphorus Match Factories (Erlangen 1847) as well as with Harle\u00df The Events of the Investigations of the Effects of Sulphur Fumes (Erlangen 1847). After he had published Chemical Fragments Concerning the Liver and Gall-Bladder (Braunschweig 1849), he went to Brazil and around Cape Horn.  He reported on this trip in his Trips in South America (Mannheim 1854, 2 vols.). After his return he lived mostly in Nuremberg where he also set up his rich collections of natural history ethnographics and died on 5 June 1878. Here he published Comparative Investigations of the Human Brain and Those of Other Vertebrates (Mannheim 1854); The Narcotic Substances of Enjoyment and the Human Being (Nuremberg 1855); Bread and the Various Grains (Nuremberg 1860); Coffee and its Substitute (Reports at the Meetings of the Academy of Sciences in Munich, 1858); The Bronze and Copper Alloys of the Old and Most Ancient Peoples (Erlangen 1869) and Concerning Old Discoveries of Iron and Silver  (Nuremberg 1873)./nErnst work on narcotics is his most famous and was recently translated into English and publish under the title Plant Intoxicants.

She received her Ph.D. in botany in 1917, under Professor Martin M\u00f6bius.[2][1]/nAfterwards, she again studied mathematics in G\u00f6ttingen for one semester, and after her return to Frankfurt in 1918 completed the state examination for teaching in the upper secondary school. After a one-year trainee-ship at schools in Frankfurt, she passed the pedagogical exam in November 1919. She then worked for three years from 1919 to 1922 teaching physics, chemistry, biology, and arithmetic at a private girls' school in Dresden.[1][2]/nIn 1922, Klieneberger-Nobel was hired as a bacteriologist at the Hygiene Institute of the University of Frankfurt.[1] She trained under Professor Max Neisser\u00a0[de] and became a member of the German Society for Hygiene and Bacteriology, publishing scientific journal articles on a wide variety of topics in bacteriology.[1][2] In 1930, she became the first female lecturer at the University of Frankfurt when she qualified as a lecturer in the Medical Faculty. However, her career was cut short by the rise of the Nazi Party. In September 1933, due to her Jewish descent, she was stripped of teaching authority on the basis of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service.[1][2] Klieneberger-Nobel received a fellowship from the American Association of University Women in 1934 after being dismissed from her position in Germany, and she used the funds to move to England./nUpon relocating to England, Klieneberger-Nobel received a position as a researcher at the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine in London, where she would remain for the rest of her career. Over the next three decades, she published about 80 scientific publications, in particular on the morphology and morphogenesis of bacteria.[1]/nHer work at the Lister Institute focused on mycoplasma, a type of microorganism that was poorly understood at the time. During her career, Klieneberger-Nobel contributed significantly to mycoplasma research and her work provided the foundation for later research into how these microorganisms cause infectious disease.[2] In 1934, she was the first to establish the differences between mycoplasmas and other bacteria species.[2] She then developed a special nutrient agar blend and culturing technique that allowed organisms causing bronchopneumonia in rats and mice to be grown in the laboratory for the first time.[2] She later used this technique to isolate and identify several pathogenic species of mycoplasma, including M. arthritides and M. pneumoniae.[2]/nShe was awarded the Jenner Memorial Scholarship from the Lister Institute in 1935.[2]/nIn addition, in 1935 she discovered and cultured unusual strains of bacteria that lacked a cell wall, naming these strains \"L-form bacteria\" after the Lister Institute where she was working.[3]  These special cell-wall-free forms of some bacterial species, which arise under certain culture conditions, have been implicated in antibiotic resistant infections.[4]/nDuring World War II, limited resources caused Klieneberger-Nobel to turn her attention to collecting micrographs of important species of bacteria, including Myxobacterium, Streptomyces, and Bacillus species.[1] The images were taken using a Zeiss microscope and Leica plate camera that she purchased during a return visit to Germany in 1934.[1] Many were subsequently included in her book \u201cFocus on Bacteria\u201d, an illustrated guide published in 1965.[1]/nIn 1962, shortly before she retired, Klieneberger-Nobel published the first book devoted to mycoplasmas, entitled \"Pleuropneumonia-like organisms (PPLO) Mycoplasmataceae\".[5] Around the same time, the importance of mycoplasmas as pathogens in humans, animals, and plants was recognized.

He discovered, described and named thousands of new species, mapped a genealogical tree relating all life forms and coined many terms in biology, including ecology,[2] phylum,[3] phylogeny,[4] and Protista.[5] Haeckel promoted and popularised Charles Darwin's work in Germany[6] and developed the influential but no longer widely held recapitulation theory (\"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\") claiming that an individual organism's biological development, or ontogeny, parallels and summarises its species' evolutionary development, or phylogeny./nThe published artwork of Haeckel includes over 100 detailed, multi-colour illustrations of animals and sea creatures, collected in his Kunstformen der Natur (\"Art Forms of Nature\"), a book which would go on to influence the Art Nouveau artistic movement.

In 1857 Haeckel attained a doctorate in medicine, and afterwards he received the license to practice medicine. The occupation of physician appeared less worthwhile to Haeckel after contact with suffering patients.[11]/nHe studied under Carl Gegenbaur at the University of Jena for three years, earning a habilitation in comparative anatomy in 1861, before becoming a professor of zoology at the University at Jena, where he remained for 47 years, from 1862 to 1909. Between 1859 and 1866 Haeckel worked on many phyla, such as radiolarians, poriferans (sponges) and annelids (segmented worms).[12] During a trip to the Mediterranean, Haeckel named nearly 150 new species of radiolarians.[12]/nIn 1864, his first wife, Anna Sethe, died. Haeckel dedicated some species of jellyfish that he found beautiful (such as Desmonema annasethe) to her.[13]\n[14]/nFrom 1866 to 1867 Haeckel made an extended journey to the Canary Islands with Hermann Fol. On 17 October 1866 he arrived in London. Over the next few days he met Charles Lyell, and visited Thomas Huxley and family at their home. On 21 October he visited Charles Darwin at Down House in Kent.[15] In 1867 he married Agnes Huschke. Their son Walter was born in 1868, their daughters Elizabeth in 1871 and Emma in 1873.[11] In 1869 he traveled as a researcher to Norway, in 1871 to Croatia (where he lived on the island of Hvar in a monastery),[16] and in 1873 to Egypt, Turkey, and Greece.[11] In 1907 he had a museum built in Jena to teach the public about evolution. Haeckel retired from teaching in 1909, and in 1910 he withdrew from the Evangelical Church of Prussia.[11]/nOn the occasion of his 80th birthday celebration he was presented with a two-volume work entitled Was wir Ernst Haeckel verdanken (What We Owe to Ernst Haeckel), edited at the request of the German Monistenbund by Heinrich Schmidt of Jena.[17][18]/nHaeckel's wife, Agnes, died in 1915, and he became substantially frailer, breaking his leg and arm.[11] He sold his \"Villa Medusa\" in Jena in 1918 to the Carl Zeiss foundation, which preserved his library.[11] Haeckel died on 9 August 1919.[19]/nHaeckel became the most famous proponent of Monism in Germany.[20]/nHaeckel's affinity for the German Romantic movement, coupled with his acceptance of a form of Lamarckism, influenced his political beliefs. Rather than being a strict Darwinian, Haeckel believed that the characteristics of an organism were acquired through interactions with the environment and that ontogeny reflected phylogeny. He saw the social sciences as instances of \"applied biology\", and that phrase was picked up and used for Nazi propaganda.[12]/nIn 1906 Haeckel belonged to the founders of the Monist League (Deutscher Monistenbund), which took a stance against philosophical materialism and promote a \"natural Weltanschauung\".[21] This organization lasted until 1933 and included such notable members as Wilhelm Ostwald, Georg von Arco (1869\u20131940), Helene St\u00f6cker and Walter Arthur Berendsohn.[22] He was the first person to use the term \"first world war\" about World War I.[23]/nHowever, Haeckel's books were banned by the Nazi Party, which refused Monism and Haeckel's freedom of thought. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that Haeckel had often overtly recognized the great contribution of educated Jews to the German culture.[24]/nHaeckel was a zoologist, an accomplished artist and illustrator, and later a professor of comparative anatomy. Although Haeckel's ideas are important to the history of evolutionary theory, and although he was a competent invertebrate anatomist most famous for his work on radiolaria, many speculative concepts that he championed are now considered incorrect. For example, Haeckel described and named hypothetical ancestral microorganisms that have never been found.[25]/nHe was one of the first to consider psychology as a branch of physiology. He also proposed the kingdom Protista[11] in 1866. His chief interests lay in evolution and life development processes in general, including development of nonrandom form, which culminated in the beautifully illustrated Kunstformen der Natur (Art forms of nature). Haeckel did not support natural selection, rather believing in Lamarckism.[26]/nHaeckel advanced a version of the earlier recapitulation theory previously set out by \u00c9tienne Serres in the 1820s and supported by followers of \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire including Robert Edmond Grant.[27] It proposed a link between ontogeny (development of form) and phylogeny (evolutionary descent), summed up by Haeckel in the phrase \"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\". His concept of recapitulation has been refuted in the form he gave it (now called \"strong recapitulation\"), in favour of the ideas first advanced by Karl Ernst von Baer. The strong recapitulation hypothesis views ontogeny as repeating forms of adult ancestors, while weak recapitulation means that what is repeated (and built upon) is the ancestral embryonic development process.[28] Haeckel supported the theory with embryo drawings that have since been shown to be oversimplified and in part inaccurate, and the theory is now considered an oversimplification of quite complicated relationships, however comparison of embryos[6] remains a powerful way to demonstrate that all animals are related. Haeckel introduced the concept of heterochrony, the change in timing of embryonic development over the course of evolution.[29][30]/nHaeckel was a flamboyant figure, who sometimes took great, non-scientific leaps from available evidence. For example, at the time when Darwin published On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (1859), Haeckel postulated that evidence of human evolution would be found in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia).  At that time, no remains of human ancestors had yet been identified.  He described these theoretical remains in great detail and even named the as-yet unfound species, Pithecanthropus alalus, and instructed his students such as Richard and Oskar Hertwig to go and find it.[citation needed]/nOne student did find some remains: a Dutchman named Eug\u00e8ne Dubois searched the East Indies from 1887 to 1895, discovering the remains of Java Man in 1891, consisting of a skullcap, thighbone, and a few teeth. These remains are among the oldest hominid remains ever found. Dubois classified Java Man with Haeckel's Pithecanthropus label, though they were later reclassified as Homo erectus. Some scientists of the day suggested[31] Dubois' Java Man as a potential intermediate form between modern humans and the common ancestor we share with the other great apes. The current consensus of anthropologists is that the direct ancestors of modern humans were African populations of Homo erectus (possibly Homo ergaster), rather than the Asian populations exemplified by Java Man and Peking Man. (Ironically, a new human species, Homo floresiensis, a dwarf human type, has recently been discovered in the island of Flores).[32]/nThe creationist polygenism of Samuel George Morton and Louis Agassiz, which presented human races as separately created species, was rejected by Charles Darwin, who argued for the monogenesis of the human species and the African origin of modern humans. In contrast to most of Darwin's supporters, Haeckel put forward a doctrine of evolutionary polygenism based on the ideas of the linguist August Schleicher, in which several different language groups had arisen separately from speechless prehuman Urmenschen (German: proto-humans), which themselves had evolved from simian ancestors. These separate languages had completed the transition from animals to man, and under the influence of each main branch of languages, humans had evolved \u2013 in a kind of Lamarckian use-inheritance \u2013 as separate species, which could be subdivided into races. From this, Haeckel drew the implication that languages with the most potential yield the human races with the most potential, led by the Semitic and Indo-Germanic groups, with Berber, Jewish, Greco-Roman and Germanic varieties to the fore.[33] As Haeckel stated:[34]/nWe must mention here one of the most important results of the comparative study of languages, which for the Stammbaum of the species of men is of the highest significance, namely that human languages probably had a multiple or polyphyletic origin. Human language as such probably developed only after the species of speechless Urmenschen or Affenmenschen (German: ape-men) had split into several species or kinds. With each of these human species, language developed on its own and independently of the others. At least this is the view of Schleicher, one of the foremost authorities on this subject.\u00a0... If one views the origin of the branches of language as the special and principal act of becoming human, and the species of humankind as distinguished according to their language stem, then one can say that the different species of men arose independently of one another./nHaeckel's view can be seen as a forerunner of the views of Carleton Coon, who also believed that human races evolved independently and in parallel with each other. These ideas eventually fell from favour.[35]/nHaeckel also applied the hypothesis of polygenism to the modern diversity of human groups. He became a key figure in social darwinism and leading proponent of scientific racism, stating for instance:[36]/nThe Caucasian, or Mediterranean man (Homo Mediterraneus), has from time immemorial been placed at the head of all the races of men, as the most highly developed and perfect. It is generally called the Caucasian race, but as, among all the varieties of the species, the Caucasian branch is the least important, we prefer the much more suitable appellation proposed by Friedrich M\u00fcller, namely, that of Mediterranese. For the most important varieties of this species, which are moreover the most eminent actors in what is called \"Universal History\", first rose to a flourishing condition on the shores of the Mediterranean.\u00a0... This species alone (with the exception of the Mongolian) has had an actual history; it alone has attained to that degree of civilisation which seems to raise men above the rest of nature./nHaeckel divided human beings into ten races, of which the Caucasian was the highest and the primitives were doomed to extinction.[37] In his view, 'Negroes' were savages and Whites were the most civilised: for instance, he claimed that '[t]he Negro' had stronger and more freely movable toes than any other race, which, he argued, was evidence of their being less evolved, and which led him to compare them to '\"four-handed\" Apes'.[38]/nIn his Ontogeny and Phylogeny Harvard paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould wrote: \"[Haeckel's] evolutionary racism; his call to the German people for racial purity and unflinching devotion to a 'just' state; his belief that harsh, inexorable laws of evolution ruled human civilization and nature alike, conferring upon favored races the right to dominate others\u00a0... all contributed to the rise of Nazism.\"[39]/nIn his introduction to the Nazi party ideologue Alfred Rosenberg's 1930 book, [The Myth of the Twentieth Century], Peter Peel affirms that Rosenberg had indeed read Haeckel.[40]/nIn the same line of thought, historian Daniel Gasman states that Haeckel's ideology stimulated the birth of Fascist ideology in Italy and France.[41]/nHowever, Robert J. Richards notes: \"Haeckel, on his travels to Ceylon and Indonesia, often formed closer and more intimate relations with natives, even members of the untouchable classes, than with the European colonials.\" and says the Nazis rejected Haeckel, since he opposed antisemitism, while supporting ideas they disliked (for instance atheism, feminism, internationalism, pacifism etc.).[42]/nThe Jena Declaration, published by the German Zoological Society, rejects the idea of human \"races\" and distances itself from the racial theories of Ernst Haeckel and other 20th century scientists. It claims that genetic variation between human populations is smaller than within them, demonstrating that the biological concept of \"races\" is invalid. The statement highlights that there are no specific genes or genetic markers that match with conventional racial categorizations. It also indicates that the idea of \"races\" is based on racism rather than any scientific factuality.[43][44]/nHaeckel claimed the origin of humanity was to be found in Asia: he believed that Hindustan (Indian subcontinent) was the actual location where the first humans had evolved. Haeckel argued that humans were closely related to the primates of Southeast Asia and rejected Darwin's hypothesis of Africa.[45][46]/nHaeckel later claimed that the missing link was to be found on the lost continent of Lemuria located in the Indian Ocean. He believed that Lemuria was the home of the first humans and that Asia was the home of many of the earliest primates; he thus supported that Asia was the cradle of hominid evolution. Haeckel also claimed that Lemuria connected Asia and Africa, which allowed the migration of humans to the rest of the world.[47][48]/nIn Haeckel's book The History of Creation (1884) he included migration routes which he thought the first humans had used outside of Lemuria.[49]/nIn Monism as Connecting Religion and Science (1892), he argued in favor of monism as the view most compatible with the current scientific understanding of the natural world. His perspective of monism was pantheistic and impersonal./nThe monistic idea of God, which alone is compatible with our present knowledge of nature, recognizes the divine spirit in all things. It can never recognise in God a \"personal being,\" or, in other words, an individual of limited extension in space, or even of human form. God is everywhere.[50]/nWhen Haeckel was a student in the 1850s he showed great interest in embryology, attending the rather unpopular lectures twice and in his notes sketched the visual aids: textbooks had few illustrations, and large format plates were used to show students how to see the tiny forms under a reflecting microscope, with the translucent tissues seen against a black background. Developmental series were used to show stages within a species, but inconsistent views and stages made it even more difficult to compare different species. It was agreed by all European evolutionists that all vertebrates looked very similar at an early stage, in what was thought of as a common ideal type, but there was a continuing debate from the 1820s between the Romantic recapitulation theory that human embryos developed through stages of the forms of all the major groups of adult animals, literally manifesting a sequence of organisms on a linear chain of being, and Karl Ernst von Baer's opposing view, stated in von Baer's laws of embryology, that the early general forms diverged into four major groups of specialised forms without ever resembling the adult of another species, showing affinity to an archetype but no relation to other types or any transmutation of species. By the time Haeckel was teaching he was able to use a textbook with woodcut illustrations written by his own teacher Albert von K\u00f6lliker, which purported to explain human development while also using other mammalian embryos to claim a coherent sequence. Despite the significance to ideas of transformism, this was not really polite enough for the new popular science writing, and was a matter for medical institutions and for experts who could make their own comparisons.[52]:\u200a264\u2013267\u200a[53]/nDarwin's On the Origin of Species, which made a powerful impression on Haeckel when he read it in 1864, was very cautious about the possibility of ever reconstructing the history of life, but did include a section reinterpreting von Baer's embryology and revolutionising the field of study, concluding that \"Embryology rises greatly in interest, when we thus look at the embryo as a picture, more or less obscured, of the common parent-form of each great class of animals.\" It mentioned von Baer's 1828 anecdote (misattributing it to Louis Agassiz) that at an early stage embryos were so similar that it could be impossible to tell whether an unlabelled specimen was of a mammal, a bird, or of a reptile, and Darwin's own research using embryonic stages of barnacles to show that they are crustaceans, while cautioning against the idea that one organism or embryonic stage is \"higher\" or \"lower\", or more or less evolved.[54] Haeckel disregarded such caution, and in a year wrote his massive and ambitious Generelle Morphologie, published in 1866, presenting a revolutionary new synthesis of Darwin's ideas with the German tradition of Naturphilosophie going back to Goethe and with the progressive evolutionism of Lamarck in what he called Darwinismus. He used morphology to reconstruct the evolutionary history of life, in the absence of fossil evidence using embryology as evidence of ancestral relationships. He invented new terms, including ontogeny and phylogeny, to present his evolutionised recapitulation theory that \"ontogeny recapitulated phylogeny\". The two massive volumes sold poorly, and were heavy going: with his limited understanding of German, Darwin found them impossible to read. Haeckel's publisher turned down a proposal for a \"strictly scholarly and objective\" second edition.[52]:\u200a269\u2013270/nHaeckel's aim was a reformed morphology with evolution as the organising principle of a cosmic synthesis unifying science, religion, and art. He was giving successful \"popular lectures\" on his ideas to students and townspeople in Jena, in an approach pioneered by his teacher Rudolf Virchow. To meet his publisher's need for a popular work he used a student's transcript of his lectures as the basis of his Nat\u00fcrliche Sch\u00f6pfungsgeschichte of 1868, presenting a comprehensive presentation of evolution. In the Spring of that year he drew figures for the book, synthesising his views of specimens in Jena and published pictures to represent types. After publication he told a colleague that the images \"are completely exact, partly copied from nature, partly assembled from all illustrations of these early stages that have hitherto become known\". There were various styles of embryological drawings at that time, ranging from more schematic representations to \"naturalistic\" illustrations of specific specimens. Haeckel believed privately that his figures were both exact and synthetic, and in public asserted that they were schematic like most figures used in teaching. The images were reworked to match in size and orientation, and though displaying Haeckel's own views of essential features, they support von Baer's concept that vertebrate embryos begin similarly and then diverge. Relating different images on a grid conveyed a powerful evolutionary message. As a book for the general public, it followed the common practice of not citing sources.[52]:\u200a270\u2013274/nThe book sold very well, and while some anatomical experts hostile to Haeckel's evolutionary views expressed some private concerns that certain figures had been drawn rather freely, the figures showed what they already knew about similarities in embryos. The first published concerns came from Ludwig R\u00fctimeyer, a professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at the University of Basel who had placed fossil mammals in an evolutionary lineage early in the 1860s and had been sent a complimentary copy. At the end of 1868 his review in the Archiv f\u00fcr Anthropologie wondered about the claim that the work was \"popular and scholarly\", doubting whether the second was true, and expressed horror about such public discussion of man's place in nature with illustrations such as the evolutionary trees being shown to non-experts. Though he made no suggestion that embryo illustrations should be directly based on specimens, to him the subject demanded the utmost \"scrupulosity and conscientiousness\" and an artist must \"not arbitrarily model or generalise his originals for speculative purposes\" which he considered proved by comparison with works by other authors. In particular, \"one and the same, moreover incorrectly interpreted woodcut, is presented to the reader three times in a row and with three different captions as [the] embryo of the dog, the chick, [and] the turtle\". He accused Haeckel of \"playing fast and loose with the public and with science\", and failing to live up to the obligation to the truth of every serious researcher. Haeckel responded with angry accusations of bowing to religious prejudice, but in the second (1870) edition changed the duplicated embryo images to a single image captioned \"embryo of a mammal or bird\". Duplication using galvanoplastic stereotypes (clich\u00e9s) was a common technique in textbooks, but not on the same page to represent different eggs or embryos. In 1891 Haeckel made the excuse that this \"extremely rash foolishness\" had occurred in undue haste but was \"bona fide\", and since repetition of incidental details was obvious on close inspection, it is unlikely to have been intentional deception.[52]:\u200a275\u2013276,\u200a282\u2013286/nThe revised 1870 second edition of 1,500 copies attracted more attention, being quickly followed by further revised editions with larger print runs as the book became a prominent part of the optimistic, nationalist, anticlerical \"culture of progress\" in Otto von Bismarck's new German Empire. The similarity of early vertebrate embryos became common knowledge, and the illustrations were praised by experts such as Michael Foster of the University of Cambridge. In the introduction to his 1871 The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, Darwin gave particular praise to Haeckel, writing that if Nat\u00fcrliche Sch\u00f6pfungsgeschichte \"had appeared before my essay had been written, I should probably never have completed it\". The first chapter included an illustration: \"As some of my readers may never have seen a drawing of an embryo, I have given one of man and another of a dog, at about the same early stage of development, carefully copied from two works of undoubted accuracy\" with a footnote citing the sources and noting that \"H\u00e4ckel has also given analogous drawings in his Sch\u00f6pfungsgeschichte.\" The fifth edition of Haeckel's book appeared in 1874, with its frontispiece a heroic portrait of Haeckel himself, replacing the previous controversial image of the heads of apes and humans.[52]:\u200a285\u2013288\u200a[55]/nLater in 1874, Haeckel's simplified embryology textbook Anthropogenie made the subject into a battleground over Darwinism aligned with Bismarck's Kulturkampf (\"culture struggle\") against the Catholic Church. Haeckel took particular care over the illustrations, changing to the leading zoological publisher Wilhelm Engelmann of Leipzig and obtaining from them use of illustrations from their other textbooks as well as preparing his own drawings including a dramatic double page illustration showing \"early\", \"somewhat later\" and \"still later\" stages of 8 different vertebrates. Though Haeckel's views had attracted continuing controversy, there had been little dispute about the embryos and he had many expert supporters, but Wilhelm His revived the earlier criticisms and introduced new attacks on the 1874 illustrations.[56] Others joined in: both expert anatomists and Catholic priests and supporters were politically opposed to Haeckel's views.[52]:\u200a288\u2013296/nWhile it has been widely claimed that Haeckel was charged with fraud by five professors and convicted by a university court at Jena, there does not appear to be an independently verifiable source for this claim.[57] Recent analyses (Richardson 1998, Richardson and Keuck 2002) have found that some of the criticisms of Haeckel's embryo drawings were legitimate, but others were unfounded.[58][59] There were multiple versions of the embryo drawings, and Haeckel rejected the claims of fraud. It was later said that \"there is evidence of sleight of hand\" on both sides of the feud between Haeckel and Wilhelm His.[60] Robert J. Richards, in a paper published in 2008, defends the case for Haeckel, shedding doubt against the fraud accusations based on the material used for comparison with what Haeckel could access at the time.[61]/nHaeckel was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1885.[62] He was awarded the title of Excellency by Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1907[63] and the Linnean Society of London's prestigious Darwin-Wallace Medal in 1908. In the United States, Mount Haeckel, a 13,418\u00a0ft (4,090\u00a0m) summit in the Eastern Sierra Nevada, overlooking the Evolution Basin, is named in his honour, as is another Mount Haeckel, a 2,941\u00a0m (9,649\u00a0ft) summit in New Zealand; and the asteroid 12323 Haeckel.[64][citation needed]/nIn Jena he is remembered with a monument at Herrenberg (erected in 1969),[65] an exhibition at Ernst-Haeckel-Haus,[66] and at the Jena Phyletic Museum, which continues to teach about evolution and share his work to this day.[67]/nThe ratfish, Harriotta haeckeli is named in his honor.[68]/nThe research vessel Ernst Haeckel is named in his honor.[69]/nIn 1981, a botanical journal called Ernstia was started being published in the city of Maracay, Venezuela.[70]/nIn 2013, Ernstia, a genus of calcareous sponges in the family Clathrinidae. The genus was erected to contain five species previously assigned to Clathrina. The genus name honors Ernst Haeckel for his contributions towards sponge taxonomy and phylogeny.[71][72]/nDarwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species had immense popular influence, but although its sales exceeded its publisher's hopes it was a technical book rather than a work of popular science: long, difficult and with few illustrations. One of Haeckel's books did a great deal to explain his version of \"Darwinism\" to the world. It was a bestselling, provocatively illustrated book in German, titled Nat\u00fcrliche Sch\u00f6pfungsgeschichte, published in Berlin in 1868, and translated into English as The History of Creation in 1876. Until 1909, eleven editions had appeared, as well as 25 translations into other languages. The Nat\u00fcrliche Sch\u00f6pfungsgeschichte cemented Haeckel's reputation as one of Germany's most forceful popularizers of science. His Weltr\u00e4thsel were reprinted ten times after the book's first publication in 1899; ultimately, over 400,000 copies were sold.[73]/nHaeckel argued that human evolution consisted of precisely 22 phases, the 21st \u2013 the \"missing link\" \u2013 being a halfway step between apes and humans. He even formally named this missing link Pithecanthropus alalus, translated as \"ape man without speech\".[74]/nHaeckel's literary output was extensive, including many books, scientific papers, and illustrations.[75]/nFor a fuller list of works of and about Haeckel, see his entry in the German Wikisource./nSome historians have seen Haeckel's social Darwinism as a forerunner to Nazi ideology.[77][78][79][page\u00a0needed] Others have denied the relationship altogether.[80][81][82]/nThe evidence is in some respects ambiguous. On one hand, Haeckel was an advocate of scientific racism. He held that evolutionary biology had definitively proven that races were unequal in intelligence and ability, and that their lives were also of unequal value, e.g., \"These lower races (such as the Veddahs or Australian negroes) are psychologically nearer to the mammals (apes or dogs) than to civilised Europeans; we must therefore, assign a totally different value to their lives.\"[83] As a result of the \"struggle for existence\", it followed that the \"lower\" races would eventually be exterminated.[84] He was also a social Darwinist who believed that \"survival of the fittest\" was a natural law, and that struggle led to improvement of the race.[85] As an advocate of eugenics, he also believed that about 200,000 mentally and congenitally ill should be killed by a medical control board.[86] This idea was later put into practice by Nazi Germany, as part of the Aktion T4 program.[87] Alfred Ploetz, founder of the German Society for Racial Hygiene, praised Haeckel repeatedly, and invited him to become an honorary member. Haeckel accepted the invitation.[88] Haeckel also believed that Germany should be governed by an authoritarian political system, and that inequalities both within and between societies were an inevitable product of evolutionary law.[89] Haeckel was also an extreme German nationalist who believed strongly in the superiority of German culture.[90]/nOn the other hand, Haeckel was not an anti-Semite. In the racial hierarchies he constructed Jews tended to appear closer to the top, rather than closer to the bottom as in Nazi racial thought.[91] He was also a pacifist until the First World War, when he wrote propaganda in favor of the war.[92] The principal arguments of historians who deny a meaningful connection between Haeckel and Nazism are that Haeckel's ideas were very common at the time, that Nazis were much more strongly influenced by other thinkers, and that Haeckel is properly classified as a 19th-century German liberal, rather than a forerunner to Nazism.[93][94] They also point to incompatibilities between evolutionary biology and Nazi ideology.[95]/nNazis themselves divided on the question of whether Haeckel should be counted as a pioneer of their ideology. SS captain and biologist Heinz Br\u00fccher wrote a biography of Haeckel in 1936, in which he praised Haeckel as a \"pioneer in biological state thinking\".[96] This opinion was also shared by the scholarly journal, Der Biologe, which celebrated Haeckel's 100th birthday, in 1934, with several essays acclaiming him as a pioneering thinker of Nazism.[97] Other Nazis kept their distance from Haeckel. Nazi propaganda guidelines issued in 1935 listed books which popularized Darwin and evolution on an \"expunged list\". Haeckel was included by name as a forbidden author.[98] Gunther Hecht, a member of the Nazi Department of Race Politics, also issued a memorandum rejecting Haeckel as a forerunner of Nazism.[99] Kurt Hildebrandt, a Nazi political philosopher, also rejected Haeckel.[99] Eventually Haeckel was rejected by Nazi bureaucrats.[100]", "22783431": "Shu Chien (traditional Chinese: \u9322\u7166; simplified Chinese: \u94b1\u7166; pinyin: Qi\u00e1n X\u00f9; born June 23, 1931) is a Chinese\u2013American physiologist and bioengineer.

He was named as a recipient of the National Medal of Science by President Barack Obama on September 27, 2011, for \"pioneering work in cardiovascular physiology and bioengineering\".[5]/nIn 1967 Chien published three papers in Science that advanced the understanding of the physics behind the flow of red blood cells.[6][7] Chien and his colleagues were able to explore the flow properties of red blood cells through various experiments involved with filtering red blood cells through plastic porous sieves. One key finding was that the flow of red blood cells does not follow Newtonian behavior and this characteristic is fundamental in aiding red blood cells to squeeze through capillaries./nChien and his colleagues further discovered the importance of the malleability of red blood cells to pass through tiny pores smaller than the cells' diameter. In other words, a healthy normal red blood cell is able to \"squeeze\" by deforming its shape and pass through small pores. In addition, this deformation helps lower the viscosity of blood and facilitate flow. Another important discovery that determines the viscosity of blood is the ability of red blood cells to aggregate to form rouleaux (like stacks of coins) due to their disc like shape. Chien and his colleagues discovered that this was a crucial factor in modulating viscosity and regulating blood flow and elucidated the mechanical, electrical and biochemical basis of this process. These discoveries show that the shape of red blood cells is not accidental, but rather a highly \"engineered design\" meant for efficient transportation./nChien has investigated the mechanisms by which mechanical forces such as pressure and flow regulate the behaviors of the cells in blood vessels, including the endothelial cells lining the vessel lumen and the smooth muscle cells in the vessel interior and their interactions. His work has led to the understanding how forces with a clear direction (as seen in the straight parts of the vascular tree) can protect the vessels from atherosclerosis and how forces without a clear direction (as seen in the branch points) make the vessels vulnerable to atherosclerosis.

He is known as \"the father of modern pathology\" and as the founder of social medicine, and to his colleagues, the \"Pope of medicine\".[4][5][6]/nVirchow studied medicine at the Friedrich Wilhelm University under Johannes Peter M\u00fcller. While working at the Charit\u00e9 hospital, his investigation of the 1847\u20131848 typhus epidemic in Upper Silesia laid the foundation for public health in Germany, and paved his political and social careers. From it, he coined a well known aphorism: \"Medicine is a social science, and politics is nothing else but medicine on a large scale\". His participation in the Revolution of 1848 led to his expulsion from Charit\u00e9 the next year. He then published a newspaper Die Medizinische Reform (The Medical Reform). He took the first Chair of Pathological Anatomy at the University of W\u00fcrzburg in 1849. After five years, Charit\u00e9 reinstated him to its new Institute for Pathology. He co-founded the political party Deutsche Fortschrittspartei, and was elected to the Prussian House of Representatives and won a seat in the Reichstag. His opposition to Otto von Bismarck's financial policy resulted in duel challenge by the latter. However, Virchow supported Bismarck in his anti-Catholic campaigns, which he named Kulturkampf (\"culture struggle\").[7]/nA prolific writer, he produced more than 2000 scientific writings.[8] Cellular Pathology (1858), regarded as the root of modern pathology, introduced the third dictum in cell theory: Omnis cellula e cellula (\"All cells come from cells\"),[9] although this concept is now widely recognized as being plagiarized from Robert Remak.[10]  He was a co-founder of Physikalisch-Medizinische Gesellschaft in 1849 and Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Pathologie in 1897. He founded journals such as Archiv f\u00fcr Pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie und f\u00fcr Klinische Medicin (with Benno Reinhardt in 1847, later renamed Virchows Archiv), and Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Ethnologie (Journal of Ethnology).[11] The latter is published by German Anthropological Association and the Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology and Prehistory, the societies which he also founded.[12]/nVirchow was the first to describe and name diseases such as leukemia, chordoma, ochronosis, embolism, and thrombosis. He coined biological terms such as \"neuroglia\", \"agenesis\", \"parenchyma\", \"osteoid\", \"amyloid degeneration\", and \"spina bifida\"; terms such as Virchow's node, Virchow\u2013Robin spaces, Virchow\u2013Seckel syndrome, and Virchow's triad are named after him. His description of the life cycle of a roundworm Trichinella spiralis influenced the practice of meat inspection. He developed the first systematic method of autopsy,[13] and introduced hair analysis in forensic investigation.[14] Opposing the germ theory of diseases, he rejected Ignaz Semmelweis's idea of disinfecting. He was critical of what he described as \"Nordic mysticism\" regarding the Aryan race.[15] As an anti-Darwinist, he called Charles Darwin an \"ignoramus\" and his own student Ernst Haeckel a \"fool\". He described the original specimen of Neanderthal man as nothing but that of a deformed human.[16]/nVirchow was born in Schievelbein, in eastern Pomerania, Prussia (now \u015awidwin, Poland).[17] He was the only child of Carl Christian Siegfried Virchow (1785\u20131865) and Johanna Maria n\u00e9e Hesse (1785\u20131857). His father was a farmer and the city treasurer. Academically brilliant, he always topped his classes and was fluent in German, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, English, Arabic, French, Italian and Dutch. He progressed to the gymnasium in K\u00f6slin (now Koszalin in Poland) in 1835 with the goal of becoming a pastor. He graduated in 1839 with a thesis titled A Life Full of Work and Toil is not a Burden but a Benediction. However, he chose medicine mainly because he considered his voice too weak for preaching.[18]/nIn 1839, he received a military fellowship, a scholarship for gifted children from poor families to become army surgeons, to study medicine at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin (now Humboldt University of Berlin).[19] He was most influenced by Johannes Peter M\u00fcller, his doctoral advisor. Virchow defended his doctoral thesis titled De rheumate praesertim corneae (corneal manifestations of rheumatic disease) on 21 October 1843.[20] Immediately on graduation, he became subordinate physician to M\u00fcller.[21] But shortly after, he joined the Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Berlin for internship. In 1844, he was appointed as medical assistant to the prosector (pathologist) Robert Froriep, from whom he learned microscopy which interested him in pathology. Froriep was also the editor of an abstract journal that specialised in foreign work, which inspired Virchow for scientific ideas of France and England.[22]/nVirchow published his first scientific paper in 1845, giving the earliest known pathological descriptions of leukemia. He passed the medical licensure examination in 1846 and immediately succeeded Froriep as hospital prosector at the Charit\u00e9. In 1847, he was appointed to his first academic position with the rank of privatdozent. Because his articles did not receive favourable attention from German editors, he founded Archiv f\u00fcr Pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie und f\u00fcr Klinische Medicin (now known as Virchows Archiv) with a colleague Benno Reinhardt in 1847. He edited alone after Reinhardt's death in 1852 till his own.[19] This journal published critical articles based on the criterion that no papers would be published that contained outdated, untested, dogmatic or speculative ideas.[18]/nUnlike his German peers, Virchow had great faith in clinical observation, animal experimentation (to determine causes of diseases and the effects of drugs) and pathological anatomy, particularly at the microscopic level, as the basic principles of investigation in medical sciences. He went further and stated that the cell was the basic unit of the body that had to be studied to understand disease. Although the term 'cell' had been coined in 1665 during the English scientist Robert Hooke's early application of the microscope to biology, the building blocks of life were still considered to be the 21 tissues of Bichat, a concept described by the French physician Xavier Bichat.[23][22]/nThe Prussian government employed Virchow to study the typhus epidemic in Upper Silesia in 1847\u20131848. It was from this medical campaign that he developed his ideas on social medicine and politics after seeing the victims and their poverty. Even though he was not particularly successful in combating the epidemic, his 190-paged Report on the Typhus Epidemic in Upper Silesia in 1848 became a turning point in politics and public health in Germany.[24][25] He returned to Berlin on 10 March 1848, and only eight days later, a revolution broke out against the government in which he played an active part. To fight political injustice he helped found Die Medizinische Reform (Medical Reform), a weekly newspaper for promoting social medicine, in July of that year. The newspaper ran under the banners \"medicine is a social science\" and \"the physician is the natural attorney of the poor\". Political pressures forced him to terminate the publication in June 1849, and he was expelled from his official position.[26]/nIn November 1848, he was given an academic appointment and left Berlin for the University of W\u00fcrzburg to hold Germany's first chair of pathological anatomy. During his six-year period there, he concentrated on his scientific work, including detailed studies of venous thrombosis and cellular theory. His first major work there was a six-volume Handbuch der speciellen Pathologie und Therapie (Handbook on Special Pathology and Therapeutics) published in 1854. In 1856, he returned to Berlin to become the newly created Chair for Pathological Anatomy and Physiology at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-University, as well as Director of the newly built Institute for Pathology on the premises of the Charit\u00e9. He held the latter post for the next 20 years.[22][27][28]/nVirchow is credited with several key discoveries. His most widely known scientific contribution is his cell theory, which built on the work of Theodor Schwann. He was one of the first to accept the work of Robert Remak, who showed that the origin of cells was the division of pre-existing cells.[29] He did not initially accept the evidence for cell division and believed that it occurs only in certain types of cells. When it dawned on him in 1855 that Remak might be right, he published Remak's work as his own, causing a falling-out between the two.[30]/nVirchow was particularly influenced in cellular theory by the work of John Goodsir of Edinburgh, whom he described as \"one of the earliest and most acute observers of cell-life both physiological and pathological\". Virchow dedicated his magnum opus Die Cellularpathologie  to Goodsir.[31] Virchow's cellular theory was encapsulated in the epigram Omnis cellula e cellula (\"all cells (come) from cells\"), which he published in 1855.[9][22][32] (The epigram was actually coined by Fran\u00e7ois-Vincent Raspail, but popularized by Virchow.)[33] It is a rejection of the concept of spontaneous generation, which held that organisms could arise from nonliving matter. For example, maggots were believed to appear spontaneously in decaying meat; Francesco Redi carried out experiments that disproved this notion and coined the maxim Omne vivum ex ovo (\"Every living thing comes from a living thing\" \u2014 literally \"from an egg\"); Virchow (and his predecessors) extended this to state that the only source for a living cell was another living cell.[34]/nIn 1845, Virchow and John Hughes Bennett independently observed abnormal increases in white blood cells in some patients. Virchow correctly identified the condition as a blood disease, and named it leuk\u00e4mie in 1847 (later anglicised to leukemia).[35][36][37] In 1857, he was the first to describe a type of tumour called chordoma that originated from the clivus (at the base of the skull).[38][39]/nVirchow was the first to correctly link the origin of cancers from otherwise normal cells.[40] (His teacher M\u00fcller had proposed that cancers originated from cells, but from special cells, which he called blastema.) In 1855, he suggested that cancers arise from the activation of dormant cells (perhaps similar to cells now known as stem cells) present in mature tissue.[41] Virchow believed that cancer is caused by severe irritation in the tissues, and his theory came to be known as chronic irritation theory. He thought, rather wrongly, that the irritation spread in the form of liquid so that cancer rapidly increases.[42] His theory was largely ignored, as he was proved wrong that it was not by liquid, but by metastasis of the already cancerous cells that cancers spread. (Metastasis was first described by Karl Thiersch in the 1860s.)[43]/nHe made a crucial observation that certain cancers (carcinoma in the modern sense) were inherently associated with white blood cells (which are now called macrophages) that produced irritation (inflammation). It was only towards the end of the 20th century that Virchow's theory was taken seriously.[44] It was realised that specific cancers (including those of mesothelioma, lung, prostate, bladder, pancreatic, cervical, esophageal, melanoma, and head and neck) are indeed strongly associated with long-term inflammation.[45][46] In addition it became clear that prolonged use of anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin, reduced cancer risk.[47] Experiments also show that drugs that block inflammation simultaneously inhibit tumour formation and development.[48]/nVirchow was one of the leading physicians to Kaiser Frederick III, who suffered from cancer of the larynx. While other physicians such as Ernst von Bergmann suggested surgical removal of the entire larynx, Virchow was opposed to it because no successful operation of this kind had ever been done. The British surgeon Morell Mackenzie performed a biopsy of the Kaiser in 1887 and sent it to Virchow, who identified it as \"pachydermia verrucosa laryngis\". Virchow affirmed that the tissues were not cancerous, even after several biopsy tests.[49][50]/nThe Kaiser died on 15 June 1888. The next day a post-mortem examination was performed by Virchow and his assistant. They found that the larynx was extensively damaged by ulceration, and microscopic examination confirmed epidermal carcinoma. Die Krankheit Kaiser Friedrich des Dritten (The Medical Report of Kaiser Frederick III) was published on 11 July under the lead authorship of Bergmann. But Virchow and Mackenzie were omitted, and they were particularly criticised for all their works.[51] The arguments between them turned into a century-long controversy, resulting in Virchow being accused of misdiagnosis and malpractice. But reassessment of the diagnostic history revealed that Virchow was right in his findings and decisions. It is now believed that the Kaiser had hybrid verrucous carcinoma, a very rare form of verrucous carcinoma, and that Virchow had no way of correctly identifying it.[49][50][52] (The cancer type was correctly identified only in 1948 by Lauren Ackerman.)[53][54]/nIt was discovered approximately simultaneously by Virchow and Charles Emile Troisier that an enlarged left supraclavicular node is one of the earliest signs of gastrointestinal malignancy, commonly of the stomach, or less commonly, lung cancer. This sign has become known as Virchow's node and simultaneously Troisier's sign.[55][56]/nVirchow is also known for elucidating the mechanism of pulmonary thromboembolism (a condition of blood clotting in the blood vessels), coining the terms embolism and thrombosis.[57] He noted that blood clots in the pulmonary artery originate first from venous thrombi, stating in 1859:/n[T]he detachment of larger or smaller fragments from the end of the softening thrombus which are carried along by the current of blood and driven into remote vessels. This gives rise to the very frequent process on which I have bestowed the name of Embolia.\"[58]/nHaving made these initial discoveries based on autopsies, he proceeded to put forward a scientific hypothesis; that pulmonary thrombi are transported from the veins of the leg and that the blood has the ability to carry such an object. He then proceeded to prove this hypothesis by well-designed experiments, repeated numerous times to consolidate evidence, and with meticulously detailed methodology. This work rebutted a claim made by the eminent French pathologist Jean Cruveilhier that phlebitis led to clot development and that thus coagulation was the main consequence of venous inflammation. This was a view held by many before Virchow's work. Related to this research, Virchow described the factors contributing to venous thrombosis, Virchow's triad.[22][59]/nVirchow founded the medical fields of cellular pathology and comparative pathology (comparison of diseases common to humans and animals). His most important work in the field was Cellular Pathology (Die Cellularpathologie in ihrer Begr\u00fcndung auf physiologische und pathologische Gewebelehre) published in 1858, as a collection of his lectures.[27] This is regarded as the basis of modern medical science,[60] and the \"greatest advance which scientific medicine had made since its beginning.\"[61]/nHis very innovative work may be viewed as between that of Giovanni Battista Morgagni, whose work Virchow studied, and that of Paul Ehrlich, who studied at the Charit\u00e9 while Virchow was developing microscopic pathology there. One of Virchow's major contributions to German medical education was to encourage the use of microscopes by medical students, and he was known for constantly urging his students to \"think microscopically\". He was the first to establish a link between infectious diseases between humans and animals, for which he coined the term \"zoonoses\".[62] He also introduced scientific terms such as \"chromatin\", \"agenesis\", \"parenchyma\", \"osteoid\", \"amyloid degeneration\", and \"spina bifida\".[63] His concepts on pathology directly opposed humourism, an ancient medical dogma that diseases were due to imbalanced body fluids, hypothetically called humours, that still pervaded.[64]/nVirchow was a great influence on Swedish pathologist Axel Key, who worked as his assistant during Key's doctoral studies in Berlin.[65]/nVirchow worked out the life cycle of a roundworm Trichinella spiralis. Virchow noticed a mass of circular white flecks in the muscle of dog and human cadavers, similar to those described by Richard Owen in 1835. He confirmed by microscopic observation that the white particles were indeed the larvae of roundworms, curled up in the muscle tissue. Rudolph Leukart found that these tiny worms could develop into adult roundworms in the intestine of a dog. He correctly asserted that these worms could also cause human helminthiasis. Virchow further demonstrated that if the infected meat is first heated to 137\u00a0\u00b0F for 10 minutes, the worms could not infect dogs or humans.[66] He established that human roundworm infection occurs via contaminated pork. This directly led to the establishment of meat inspection, which was first adopted in Berlin.[67][68]/nVirchow was the first to develop a systematic method of autopsy, based on his knowledge of cellular pathology. The modern autopsy still constitutes his techniques.[69] His first significant autopsy was on a 50-year-old woman in 1845. He found an unusual number of white blood cells, and gave a detailed description in 1847 and named the condition as leuk\u00e4mie.[70] One on his autopsies in 1857 was the first description of vertebral disc rupture.[20][71] His autopsy on a baby in 1856 was the first description of congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia (the name given by K. M. Laurence a century later), a rare and fatal disease of the lung.[72] From his experience of post-mortem examinations of cadavers, he published his method in a small book in 1876.[73] His book was the first to describe the techniques of autopsy specifically to examine abnormalities in organs, and retain important tissues for further examination and demonstration. Unlike any other earlier practitioner, he practiced complete surgery of all body parts with body organs dissected one by one. This has become the standard method.[74][75]/nVirchow discovered the clinical syndrome which he called ochronosis, a metabolic disorder in which a patient accumulates homogentisic acid in connective tissues and which can be identified by discolouration seen under the microscope. He found the unusual symptom in an autopsy of the corpse of a 67-year-old man on 8 May 1884. This was the first time this abnormal disease affecting cartilage and connective tissue was observed and characterised. His description and coining of the name appeared in the October 1866 issue of Virchows Archiv.[76][77][78]/nVirchow was the first to analyse hair in criminal investigation, and made the first forensic report on it in 1861.[79] He was called as an expert witness in a murder case, and he used hair samples collected from the victim. He became the first to recognise the limitation of hair as evidence. He found that hairs can be different in an individual, that individual hair has characteristic features, and that hairs from different individuals can be strikingly similar. He concluded that evidence based on hair analysis is inconclusive.[80] His testimony runs:/n[T]he hairs found on the defendant do not possess any so pronounced peculiarities or individualities [so] that no one with certainty has the right to assert that they must have originated from the head of the victim.[14]/nVirchow developed an interest in anthropology in 1865, when he discovered pile dwellings in northern Germany. In 1869, he co-founded the German Anthropological Association. In 1870 he founded the Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology, and Prehistory (Berliner Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte) which was very influential in coordinating and intensifying German archaeological research. Until his death, Virchow was several times (at least fifteen times) its president, often taking turns with his former student Adolf Bastian.[8] As president, Virchow frequently contributed to and co-edited the society's main journal Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Ethnologie (Journal of Ethnology), which Adolf Bastian, together with another student of Virchow, Robert Hartman, had founded in 1869.[81][82]/nIn 1870, he led a major excavation of the hill forts in Pomerania. He also excavated wall mounds in W\u00f6llstein in 1875 with Robert Koch, whose paper he edited on the subject.[18] For his contributions in German archaeology, the Rudolf Virchow lecture is held annually in his honour. He made field trips to Asia Minor, the Caucasus, Egypt, Nubia, and other places, sometimes in the company of Heinrich Schliemann. His 1879 journey to the site of Troy is described in Beitr\u00e4ge zur Landeskunde in Troas (\"Contributions to the knowledge of the landscape in Troy\", 1879) and Alttrojanische Gr\u00e4ber und Sch\u00e4del (\"Old Trojan graves and skulls\", 1882).[23][83]/nVirchow was an opponent of Darwin's theory of evolution,[84][85] and particularly skeptical of the emergent thesis of human evolution.[86][87] He did not reject evolutionary theory as a whole, and viewed the theory of natural selection as \"an immeasurable advance\" but that still has no \"actual proof.\"[88] On 22 September 1877, he delivered a public address entitled \"The Freedom of Science in the Modern State\" before the Congress of German Naturalists and Physicians in Munich. There he spoke against the teaching of the theory of evolution in schools, arguing that it was as yet an unproven hypothesis that lacked empirical foundations and that, therefore, its teaching would negatively affect scientific studies.[89][90] Ernst Haeckel, who had been Virchow's student, later reported that his former professor said that \"it is quite certain that man did not descend from the apes...not caring in the least that now almost all experts of good judgment hold the opposite conviction.\"[91]/nVirchow became one of the leading opponents on the debate over the authenticity of Neanderthal, discovered in 1856, as distinct species and ancestral to modern humans. He himself examined the original fossil in 1872, and presented his observations before the Berliner Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte.[8] He stated that the Neanderthal had not been a primitive form of human, but an abnormal human being, who, judging by the shape of his skull, had been injured and deformed, and considering the unusual shape of his bones, had been arthritic, rickety, and feeble.[92][93][94] With such an authority, the fossil was rejected as new species. With this reasoning, Virchow \"judged Darwin an ignoramus and Haeckel a fool and was loud and frequent in the publication of these judgments,\"[95] and declared that \"it is quite certain that man did not descend from the apes.\"[96] The Neanderthals were later accepted as distinct species of humans, Homo neanderthalensis.[97][98]/nOn 22 September 1877, at the Fiftieth Conference of the German Association of Naturalists and Physician held in Munich, Haeckel pleaded for introducing evolution in the public school curricula, and tried to dissociate Darwinism from social Darwinism.[99] His campaign was because of Herman M\u00fcller, a school teacher who was banned because of his teaching a year earlier on the inanimate origin of life from carbon. This resulted in prolonged public debate with Virchow. A few days later Virchow responded that Darwinism was only a hypothesis, and morally dangerous to students. This severe criticism of Darwinism was immediately taken up by the London Times, from which further debates erupted among English scholars. Haeckel wrote his arguments in the October issue of Nature titled \"The Present Position of Evolution Theory\", to which Virchow responded in the next issue with an article \"The Liberty of Science in the Modern State\".[100] Virchow stated that teaching of evolution was \"contrary to the conscience of the natural scientists, who reckons only with facts.\"[88] The debate led Haeckel to write a full book Freedom in Science and Teaching in 1879. That year the issue was discussed in the Prussian House of Representatives and the verdict was in favour of Virchow. In 1882 the Prussian education policy officially excluded natural history in schools.[101]/nYears later, the noted German physician Carl Ludwig Schleich would recall a conversation he held with Virchow, who was a close friend of his: \"...On to the subject of Darwinism. 'I don't believe in all this,' Virchow told me. 'if I lie on my sofa and blow the possibilities away from me, as another man may blow the smoke of his cigar, I can, of course, sympathize with such dreams. But they don't stand the test of knowledge. Haeckel is a fool. That will be apparent one day. As far as that goes, if anything like transmutation did occur it could only happen in the course of pathological degeneration!'\"[102]/nVirchow's ultimate opinion about evolution was reported a year before he died; in his own words:/nThe intermediate form is unimaginable save in a dream... We cannot teach or consent that it is an achievement that man descended from the ape or other animal./nVirchow's anti-evolutionism, like that of Albert von K\u00f6lliker and Thomas Brown, did not come from religion, since he was not a believer.[16]/nVirchow believed that Haeckel's monist propagation of social Darwinism was in its nature politically dangerous and anti-democratic, and he also criticized it because he saw it as related to the emergent nationalist movement in Germany, ideas about cultural superiority,[105][106][107] and militarism.[108] In 1885, he launched a study of craniometry, which gave results contradictory to contemporary scientific racist theories on the \"Aryan race\", leading him to denounce the \"Nordic mysticism\" at the 1885 Anthropology Congress in Karlsruhe. Josef Kollmann, a collaborator of Virchow, stated at the same congress that the people of Europe, be they German, Italian, English or French, belonged to a \"mixture of various races\", further declaring that the \"results of craniology\" led to a \"struggle against any theory concerning the superiority of this or that European race\" over others.[109] He analysed the hair, skin, and eye colour of 6,758,827 schoolchildren to identify the Jews and Aryans. His findings, published in 1886 and concluding that there could be neither a Jewish nor a German race, were regarded as a blow to anti-Semitism and the existence of an \"Aryan race\".[15][110]/nVirchow did not believe in the germ theory of diseases, as advocated by Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch. He proposed that diseases came from abnormal activities inside the cells, not from outside pathogens.[62] He believed that epidemics were social in origin, and the way to combat epidemics was political, not medical. He regarded germ theory as a hindrance to prevention and cure. He considered social factors such as poverty major causes of disease.[111] He even attacked Koch's and Ignaz Semmelweis' policy of handwashing as an antiseptic practice, who said of him: \"Explorers of nature recognize no bugbears other than individuals who speculate.\"[64] He postulated that germs were only using infected organs as habitats, but were not the cause, and stated, \"If I could live my life over again, I would devote it to proving that germs seek their natural habitat: diseased tissue, rather than being the cause of diseased tissue\".[112]/nMore than a laboratory physician, Virchow was an impassioned advocate for social and political reform. His ideology involved social inequality as the cause of diseases that requires political actions,[113] stating:/nMedicine is a social science, and politics is nothing else but medicine on a large scale. Medicine, as a social science, as the science of human beings, has the obligation to point out problems and to attempt their theoretical solution: the politician, the practical anthropologist, must find the means for their actual solution... Science for its own sake usually means nothing more than science for the sake of the people who happen to be pursuing it. Knowledge which is unable to support action is not genuine \u2013 and how unsure is activity without understanding... If medicine is to fulfill her great task, then she must enter the political and social life... The physicians are the natural attorneys of the poor, and the social problems should largely be solved by them.[114][115][116]/nVirchow actively worked for social change to fight poverty and diseases. His methods involved pathological observations and statistical analyses. He called this new field of social medicine a \"social science\". His most important influences could be noted in Latin America, where his disciples introduced his social medicine.[117] For example, his student Max Westenh\u00f6fer became Director of Pathology at the medical school of the University of Chile, becoming the most influential advocate. One of Westenh\u00f6fer's students, Salvador Allende, through social and political activities based on Virchow's doctrine, became the 29th President of Chile (1970\u20131973).[118]/nVirchow made himself known as a pronounced pro-democracy progressive in the year of revolutions in Germany (1848). His political views are evident in his Report on the Typhus Outbreak of Upper Silesia, where he states that the outbreak could not be solved by treating individual patients with drugs or with minor changes in food, housing, or clothing laws, but only through radical action to promote the advancement of an entire population, which could be achieved only by \"full and unlimited democracy\" and \"education, freedom and prosperity\".[26]/nThese radical statements and his minor part in the revolution caused the government to remove him from his position in 1849, although within a year he was reinstated as prosector \"on probation\". Prosector was a secondary position in the hospital. This secondary position in Berlin convinced him to accept the chair of pathological anatomy at the medical school in the provincial town of W\u00fcrzburg, where he continued his scientific research. Six years later, he had attained fame in scientific and medical circles, and was reinstated at Charit\u00e9 Hospital.[22]/nIn 1859, he became a member of the Municipal Council of Berlin and began his career as a civic reformer. Elected to the Prussian Diet in 1862, he became leader of the Radical or Progressive party; and from 1880 to 1893, he was a member of the Reichstag.[23] He worked to improve healthcare conditions for Berlin citizens, especially by working towards modern water and sewer systems. Virchow is credited as a founder of anthropology[119] and of social medicine, frequently focusing on the fact that disease is never purely biological, but often socially derived or spread.[120]/nAs a co-founder and member of the liberal party Deutsche Fortschrittspartei, he was a leading political antagonist of Bismarck. He was opposed to Bismarck's excessive military budget, which angered Bismarck sufficiently that he challenged Virchow to a duel in 1865.[23] Virchow declined because he considered dueling an uncivilized way to solve a conflict.[121] Various English-language sources purport a different version of events, the so-called \"Sausage Duel\". It has Virchow, being the one challenged and therefore entitled to choose the weapons, selecting two pork sausages, one loaded with Trichinella larvae, the other safe; Bismarck declined.[62][122][123] However, there are no German-language documents confirming this version./nVirchow supported Bismarck in an attempt to reduce the political and social influence of the Catholic Church, between 1871 and 1887.[124] He remarked that the movement was acquiring \"the character of a great struggle in the interest of humanity\". He called it Kulturkampf (\"culture struggle\")[7] during the discussion of Paul Ludwig Falk's May Laws (Maigesetze).[125] Virchow was respected in Masonic circles,[126] and according to one source[127] may have been a freemason, though no official record of this has been found./nOn 24 August 1850 in Berlin, Virchow married Ferdinande Rosalie Mayer (29 February 1832\u00a0\u2013 21 February 1913), a liberal's daughter. They had three sons and three daughters:[128]/nVirchow broke his thigh bone on 4 January 1902, jumping off a running streetcar while exiting the electric tramway. Although he anticipated full recovery, the fractured femur never healed, and restricted his physical activity. His health gradually deteriorated and he died of heart failure after eight months, on 5 September 1902, in Berlin.[18][130] A state funeral was held on 9 September in the Assembly Room of the Magistracy in the Berlin Town Hall, which was decorated with laurels, palms and flowers. He was buried in the Alter St.-Matth\u00e4us-Kirchhof in Sch\u00f6neberg, Berlin.[131] His tomb was shared by his wife on 21 February 1913.[132]/nRudolf Virchow was also a collector. Several museums in Berlin emerged from Virchow's collections: the M\u00e4rkisches Museum, the Museum of Prehistory and Early History, the Ethnological Museum and the Museum of Medical History. In addition, Virchow's collection of anatomical specimens from numerous European and non-European populations, which still exists today, deserves special mention. The collection is owned by the Berlin Society for Anthropology and Prehistory.\nThe collection hit the international headlines in 2020 when the two journalists Markus Grill and David Bruser, in cooperation with the archivist Nils Seethaler, succeeded in identifying four skulls of indigenous Canadians that were thought to be lost and which came into Virchow's possession through the mediation of the Canadian doctor William Osler in the late 19th century.[133][134]/nVirchow was a prolific writer.

A rationalist of his time, he was a critic of verifiable myths, such as spontaneous generation.[8] His most famous experiments are described in his magnum opus Esperienze intorno alla generazione degl'insetti (Experiments on the Generation of Insects), published in 1668. He disproved that vipers drink wine and could break glasses, and that their venom was poisonous when ingested. He correctly observed that snake venoms were produced from the fangs, not the gallbladder, as was believed. He was also the first to recognize and correctly describe details of about 180 parasites, including Fasciola hepatica and Ascaris lumbricoides. He also distinguished earthworms from helminths (like tapeworms, flukes, and roundworms). He possibly originated the use of the control, the basis of experimental design in modern biology. A collection of his poems first published in 1685 Bacco in Toscana (Bacchus in Tuscany) is considered among the finest works of 17th-century Italian poetry, and for which the Grand Duke Cosimo III gave him a medal of honor./nThe son of Gregorio Redi and Cecilia de Ghinci, Francesco Redi was born in Arezzo on 18 February 1626. His father was a renowned physician at Florence. After schooling with the Jesuits, Francesco Redi attended the University of Pisa from where he obtained his doctoral degrees in medicine and philosophy in 1647, at the age of 21.[4] He constantly moved, to Rome, Naples, Bologna, Padua, and Venice, and finally settled in Florence in 1648. Here he was registered at the Collegio Medico where he served at the Medici Court as both the head physician and superintendent of the ducal apothecary to Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and his successor, Cosimo III. It is here that most of his academic works were achieved, which earned him membership in Accademia dei Lincei. He was also a member of the Accademia del Cimento (Academy of Experiment) from 1657 to 1667.[9]/nHe died in his sleep on 1 March 1697 in Pisa and his remains were returned to Arezzo for interment.[10][11]/nA collection of his letters is held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.[12]/nIn 1664 Redi wrote his first monumental work Osservazioni intorno alle vipere (Observations on Vipers) to his friend Lorenzo Magalotti, secretary of the Accademia del Cimento. In this he began to break the prevailing scientific myths (which he called \"unmasking of the untruths\") such as vipers drink wine and shatter glasses, their venom is poisonous if swallowed, the head of dead viper is an antidote, the viper's venom is produced from the gallbladder, and so on. He explained rather how snake venom is unrelated to the snake\u2019s bite, an idea contrary to popular belief.[13] He performed a series of experiments on the effects of snakebites, and demonstrated that venom was poisonous only when it enters the bloodstream via a bite, and that the fang contains venom in the form of yellow fluid.[9][14] He even showed that by applying a tight ligature before the wound, the passage of venom into the heart could be prevented. This work marked the beginning of experimental toxinology/toxicology.[15][16]/nRedi is best known for his series of experiments, published in 1668 as Esperienze intorno alla generazione degl'insetti (Experiments on the Generation of Insects), which is regarded as his masterpiece and a milestone in the history of modern science. The book is one of the first steps in refuting \"spontaneous generation\"\u2014a theory also known as Aristotelian abiogenesis. At the time, prevailing wisdom was that maggots arose spontaneously from rotting meat.[6]/nRedi took six jars and divided them into two groups of three: In one experiment, in the first jar of each group, he put an unknown object; in the second, a dead fish; in the last, a raw chunk of veal. Redi covered the tops of the first group of jars with fine gauze so that only air could get into it. He left the other group open. After several days, he saw maggots appear on the objects in the open jars, on which flies had been able to land, but not in the gauze-covered jars. In the second experiment, meat was kept in three jars. One of the jars was uncovered, and two of the jars were covered, one with cork and the other one with gauze. Flies could only enter the uncovered jar, and in this, maggots appeared. In the jar that was covered with gauze, maggots appeared on the gauze but did not survive.[17][18]/nRedi continued his experiments by capturing the maggots and waiting for them to metamorphose, which they did, becoming flies. Also, when dead flies or maggots were put in sealed jars with dead animals or veal, no maggots appeared, but when the same thing was done with living flies, maggots did. His interpretations were always based on biblical passages, such as his famous adage: omne vivum ex vivo (\"All life comes from life\").[4][19]/nRedi was the first to describe ectoparasites in his Esperienze intorno alla generazione degl'insetti. His notable illustrations in the book are those relevant to ticks, including deer ticks and tiger ticks; it also contains the first depiction of the larva of Cephenemyiinae, the nasal flies of deer, as well as the sheep liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica). His next treatise in 1684 titled Osservazioni intorno agli animali viventi che si trovano negli animali viventi (Observations on Living Animals, that are in Living Animals) recorded the descriptions and the illustrations of more than 100 parasites. In it he also differentiates the earthworm (generally regarded as a helminth) and Ascaris lumbricoides, the human roundworm. An important innovation from the book is his experiments in chemotherapy in which he employed the \"control\"', the basis of experimental design in modern biological research.[2][4][20] He described some 180 species of parasites. Perhaps, his most significant observation was that parasites produce eggs and develop from them, which contradicted the prevailing opinion that they are produced spontaneously.[21]/nAs a poet, Redi is best known for the dithyramb Bacco in Toscana (Bacchus in Tuscany), which first appeared in 1685. His bacchanalian poem in praise of Tuscan wines is still read in Italy today.[9] He was admitted to two literary societies: the Academy of Arcadia and the Accademia della Crusca.[10] He was an active member of Crusca and supported the preparation of the Tuscan dictionary.[22] He taught the Tuscan language as a lettore pubblico di lingua toscana in Florence in 1666.

Here, she works as the Principle Investigator (PI) in the Schmidt Lab.[1]/nSchmidt continues to be an associate professor at Northwestern, and often publishes work and speaks at universities or conferences to present her research. A few of Schmidt's presentations at conferences and universities have been recorded and are available for members of the public to view. In 2019, as part of the #Womeninscience campaign presented by Scientifica, she gave an interview discussing her path to becoming a PI, as well as how she balances her family life and career demands.[7]/nAs a graduate student in the laboratory of Paulo Kofuji at the University of Minnesota, Schmidt's research focused on analyzing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) at the single-cell level to determine how ipRGCs relay light information to the brain.[3] In early experiments, Schmidt and colleagues created a transgenic mouse line in which the melanopsin promoter drives the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP).[4][8] This allowed them to label ipRGCs in vivo and study changes in ipRGC light sensitivity and synaptic connectivity over the course of postnatal development. Results from whole-cell recordings of ipRGC membrane voltage in response to white-light stimuli demonstrated that ipRGCs shift from relying solely on intrinsic phototransduction before mice open their eyes to relying on intrinsic and extrinsic phototransduction after eye-opening.[4][9] The intrinsic phototransduction pathway was mediated by melanopsin, while the extrinsic pathway utilized retinal rod and cone systems. The ability to label ipRGCs with EGFP also allowed Schmidt and her colleagues to specify the morphology and location of three ipRGC subpopulations within the inner plexiform layer of the retina.[4]/nIn 2009, Schmidt and Kofuji utilized the same transgenic mouse line to label ipRGCs in vivo with EGFP[4][8] which allowed them to identify functional differences between the M1 and M2 ipRGC subpopulations. The results identified morphological differences in M1 and M2 ipRGCs, including larger dendrites and soma within the M2 subpopulation. M2 ipRGCs also displayed more complex dendritic branching. In addition, using techniques from electrophysiology, such as current-clamp recordings, voltage-clamp recordings, and patch-clamping, this research identified differences in the light responses of M1 and M2 ipRGCs.[9] Results from this study suggested that M1 ipRGCs have higher levels of melanopsin than M2 cells and showed most definitively that M2 cells are intrinsically photosensitive, a finding that had not yet been discovered in prior research. These differences between M1 and M2 ipRGCs suggested the possibility that these subpopulations might signal light information to different areas of the brain.[8]/nIn 2014, as a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Samer Hattar at Johns Hopkins University, Schmidt and colleagues used immunohistochemistry to identify that a subset of retinal ganglion cells, ON alpha RGCs, express a melanopsin reporter.[5][10] Whole-cell recordings from ON alpha RGCs showed that these cells are intrinsically photosensitive.[9] Together, these results suggested that the intrinsic photosensitivity of ON alpha RGCs is driven by melanopsin, which was confirmed using melanopsin-deficient (Opn4-/-) mice, as the ON alpha RGCs in these mice were observed to completely lose intrinsic photosensitivity.[10] Furthermore, ON alpha RGCs in diurnal ground squirrels displayed intrinsic photosensitivity which suggested that this may be a feature of ON alpha RGCs across several different species.[10]/nThis study also identified the role of melanopsin in contrast detection, an important aspect of image-forming vision. Schmidt and Hattar used an optokinetic tracking assay to determine that Opn4-/- mice showed reduced contrast sensitivity.[10][11][12] Deficits in contrast sensitivity were significantly worsened in a mouse model in which ON alpha RGCs were ablated. These results demonstrate that melanopsin and ON alpha RGCs play a role in image-forming vision by regulating contrast sensitivity.[10]/nOver the course of her career, Schmidt has received several awards for her work. As a graduate student at the University of Minnesota, she won the Morris Smithberg Memorial Prize from the Graduate Program in Neuroscience in 2007 which is granted to the best performing student on first-year courses and the final written exam. Additionally, she won the Milne and Brandenburg Research Award in 2010 which is awarded to students for their thesis research in the biomedical sciences.[13] In her thesis, Schmidt studied the properties and morphology of ipRGCs.[3]/nSchmidt has been awarded several fellowships, awards, and grants for her research. She won the New Innovator Award from the NIH in January 2016 for her project titled \"Genetic Mapping of Visual Circuits.\"[14] The award is given to new researchers whose projects show potential to have wide-ranging impacts. In 2016, Schmidt won the Karl Kirchgessner Foundation Vision Research Grant which is a foundation that primarily supports disadvantaged individuals but also grants money for new research in vision.[15][6]  In 2016, she won the Klingenstein-Simons Fellowship Award in the Neurosciences for her work in light-driven behavior.[16] Additionally, in 2017 she won the Sloan Research Fellowship Award in Neuroscience which is a two-year $75,000 fellowship granted to young researchers, and in 2019 she was a recipient of the Brain Research Fay/Frank Seed Grant which funds neuroscience research.[17][18] She received the Pisart Award for Outstanding Achievements in Vision Science in 2019.[19][20] In 2020, Schmidt won the Junior Faculty Award from the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms for her exceptional work in the chronobiology field./nCurrently, Schmidt is still conducting research in her lab at Northwestern University.

Briscoe has discovered and systematically demonstrated over the course of her career that butterflies are a unique organism to enable such studies on account of the diversity of photoreceptor proteins, or opsins, which are expressed in the retina of a butterfly. She is also known for her studies on gene expression of phototransduction proteins, duplication events in opsin genes, the discovery of new opsins, and the discovery of pigments which present in the wing coloration patterns of butterflies. Her studies have also demonstrated the co-evolution of butterfly vision and wing color at a molecular-level as a strategy for secure inter-species communication./nFor her research contributions, Briscoe has been recognized as an elected fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Royal Entomological Society. Briscoe has also been recognized as a Distinguished Scientist of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS). In 2021, she was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship./nBriscoe was born in Hawaii and was raised in Colton, California, where she graduated from Colton High School in 1988.[1] Briscoe comes from a family of Mexican American teachers and was especially inspired to pursue higher education by her family members and most especially her maternal grandmother, Consuelo Lozano, and her mother, Loretta Mej\u00eda.[1][2][3] In 1937, Briscoe's maternal grandmother was the only Spanish-named woman attending Colton High in San Bernardino County to graduate. Briscoe's mother was the only Spanish-named woman from San Bernardino county to graduate from the University of California, Riverside in 1965.[2] She jumped a grade in school and found herself inspired by her new teacher who showed them fossil teeth and taught them songs to remember the name of dinosaurs.[4]/nAfter graduating high school, Briscoe went on to study at Stanford University, where she received a B.A. in philosophy, a B.S. in biological sciences and a M.A. in philosophy.[5] She continued her graduate studies at Harvard University,[1] specializing in evolutionary biology where her Ph.D. advisers were Naomi Pierce and Richard Lewontin. After receiving her Ph.D. she was a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Arizona and at the University of Colorado, Denver,[5] where she was supported with a fellowship from the Ford Foundation. In 2012, Briscoe was an overseas visiting research fellow at St. John's College at the University of Cambridge. She has been a faculty affiliate of the BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action since 2012.[6] In the area of policy and higher education, Briscoe has been vocal on her support of government action to get more Latino individuals to teach science.[2]/nBriscoe's research career has been largely distinguished by her studies on the evolution of vision in butterflies. She is particularly well known for the discovery of new opsins, her application of functional approaches for the study of light-sensitive pigments which lead to color vision, and her study of the links between genetic expression of these proteins and functional behavior. Her investigations have been largely situated in the field of molecular evolution./nSince her time as a graduate student at Harvard University, Briscoe has been involved with the discovery of opsins which are key in butterfly vision alongside studying the expression levels of these photoreceptors as a function of functional butterfly behavior. Her studies have also sought to elucidate the role and emergence of double gene duplication events in opsin protein expression as a function of environmental stimuli.[5] Such double duplication events have been hypothesized to play a key role in the evolution of color vision in primates, including humans. As Briscoe herself has addressed, gene duplication and mutation events in opsins more broadly account for a large fraction of genetic changes associated with human retinal diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa.[7]/nBriscoe's career has been distinguished by the study of diverse butterfly species and  international collaborations which have supported these investigations. Her recent research collaboration between her team and that of Jorge Llorente Bousequets from the UNAM-Facultad De Ciencas was particularly productive and led to the discovery[8][9] that the Heliconius butterfly species differentially expresses one or two genes for an opsin photoreceptor which is uniquely sensitive to ultra-violet reflecting wing colors. This discovery was particularly significant as it demonstrated that the Heliconius butterfly had co-evolved two traits, ultra-violet photoreceptors and ultra-violet reflecting wing pigments, as an effectively private (or secure) inter-species communication channel.[10][11] In the course of the investigations, Briscoe and collaborators also identified the chemical composition of the evolved pigment which, in combination with the nanostructured nature of scale cells on the butterfly wing, leads to the phenomena of UV-yellow butterfly wing coloration./nHer team's continued investigations on ultra-violet opsins in the Heliconius erato butterfly have elucidated additional layers of diversification in gene expression which are linked to a butterfly's gender. Specifically, females of the species have two different UV receptors, UVRh1 and UVRh2, while males only have one (UVRh2).[12] These studies are of particular interest towards future investigations on understanding the evolutionary mechanisms leading to the emergence of novel opsins.[13]/nIn the area of service to the scientific community, Briscoe served as Associate Editor for the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution from 2005 until 2012.

Hitchings and Sir James Black for their use of innovative methods of rational drug design for the development of new drugs.[3] This new method focused on understanding the target of the drug rather than simply using trial-and-error. Her work led to the creation of the anti-retroviral drug AZT, which was the first drug widely used against AIDS. Her well known works also include the development of the first immunosuppressive drug, azathioprine, used to fight rejection in organ transplants, and the first successful antiviral drug, acyclovir (ACV), used in the treatment of herpes infection.[4]/nElion was born in New York City on January 23, 1918,[1] to parents Robert Elion, a Lithuanian Jewish immigrant and a dentist, and Bertha Cohen, a Polish Jewish immigrant.

He matriculated at University College (which eventually became the University of Dundee) in 1943 and graduated from University of St Andrews School of Medicine with an MB ChB in 1946.[8] During his time at St Andrews, Black lived in St Salvator's Hall./nAfter graduating, he stayed at University College to join the physiology department as an assistant lecturer before taking a lecturer position at King Edward VII College of Medicine in Singapore that subsequently became part of the University of Malaya.[8][9] Black had decided against a career as a medical practitioner as he objected to what he considered the insensitive treatment of patients at the time.[9]/nBlack had large debts upon his graduation from university, so he took a teaching job in Singapore for three years, before moving to London in 1950[10] and then on to join the University of Glasgow (Veterinary School) where he established the Veterinary Physiology Department and developed an interest in the way adrenaline affects the human heart, particularly in those suffering from angina.[11] Having formulated a theory of an approach by which the effects of adrenaline might be annulled, he joined ICI Pharmaceuticals in 1958, remaining with the company until 1964, during which time he invented propranolol,[5] which later became the world's best-selling drug.[11] During this time Black pioneered a method of research whereby drug molecules were purposefully built instead of being synthesised first and then investigated for their potential medical uses.[9] The discovery of propranolol was hailed as the greatest breakthrough in the treatment of heart disease since the discovery of digitalis.[11]/nAt the same time, Black was developing a similar method of inventing drugs for treatment of stomach ulcers, but ICI did not wish to pursue the idea so Black resigned in 1964 and joined Smith, Kline and French where he worked for nine years until 1973.[12] While there, Black developed his second major drug, cimetidine, which was launched under the brand name Tagamet in 1975 and soon outsold propranolol to become the world's largest-selling prescription drug.[11]/nBlack was appointed professor, and head of department, of pharmacology at University College London in 1973 where he established a new undergraduate course in medicinal chemistry[6] but he became frustrated by the lack of funding for research and accepted the post of director of therapeutic research at the Wellcome Research Laboratories in 1978.[9] However he did not agree with his immediate boss there, Sir John Vane, and resigned in 1984.[9] Black then became Professor of Analytical Pharmacology at the Rayne Institute of King's College London medical school, where he remained until 1992.[9] He established the James Black Foundation in 1988 with funding from Johnson & Johnson and led a team of 25 scientists in drugs research, including work on gastrin inhibitors which can prevent some stomach cancers.[9]/nBlack contributed to basic scientific and clinical knowledge in cardiology, both as a physician and as a basic scientist. His invention of propranolol, the beta adrenergic receptor antagonist that revolutionised the medical management of angina pectoris, is considered to be one of the most important contributions to clinical medicine and pharmacology of the 20th century.[13][14] Propranolol has been described as the greatest breakthrough in heart disease treatments since the 18th century discovery of digitalis and has benefited millions of people.[9] Black's method of research, his discoveries about adrenergic pharmacology, and his clarification of the mechanisms of cardiac action are all strengths of his work.[15]/nHe was greatly involved in the synthesis of cimetidine, at the time a revolutionary drug for the treatment and prevention of peptic ulcers. Cimetidine was the first of a new class of drugs, the H2-receptor antagonists./nIn 1980, Black's association with the University of Dundee was renewed when the institution recognised his many achievements by conferring him with the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws. In 1992 he accepted an offer to succeed the 16th Earl of Dalhousie as Chancellor of the University and was installed as Chancellor at the award ceremony held in Dundee Repertory Theatre on 29 April 1992. Appropriately the first degree he conferred was to Professor Robert Campbell Garry, who had been responsible for his original appointment at University College Dundee. Sir James remarked at this ceremony that by returning to Dundee he was \"in a real sense, coming home\".[8]/nAs Chancellor, Sir James Black did much to promote the University of Dundee and was a popular figure within the University. He was awarded a second honorary degree, that of Doctor of Science, in 2005. He retired from his post the following year, and his association with the University of Dundee was marked with launching of the \u00a320 million Sir James Black Centre. The centre, intended to promote interdisciplinary research in the life sciences, was opened by Sydney Brenner in 2006. Sir James Black himself visited the centre in October 2006 and was reportedly excited and pleased by what he saw.[8]/nA portrait of Black in his chancellor's robes, by Helene Train, is held as part of the University's fine art collection.[16] The portrait is currently displayed in the foyer of the Sir James Black Centre./nBlack was made a Knight Bachelor on 10 February 1981 for services to medical research, receiving the honour from the Queen at Buckingham Palace.[11][17] On 26 May 2000 he was appointed to the Order of Merit, of which there are only 24 members at any one time, by Queen Elizabeth II.[18][19]/nBlack was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1976[20] and the same year he was awarded the Lasker award.[21] His certificate of election to the Royal Society reads:/nHas made outstanding contributions, based on fundamental considerations of receptor theory, to the development of new drugs of clinical importance. Introduced the first effective beta blockers and analysed their cardiovascular effects. These drugs have opened up new perspectives for the treatment of angina pectoris, cardiac irregularities and hypertension. More recently, in a concerted drive carried out with great vision, he has developed a new type of histamine antagonist capable of inhibiting gastric acid secretion induced by histamine or pentagastrin. Apart from its practical implications this work has considerable fundamental importance since it provided evidence for the existence of a new type of histamine receptor. This work has also provided experimental support for the hypothesis that endogenous histamine may be involved in the secretion of acid in the stomach.[1]/nIn 1979, he was awarded the Artois-Baillet Latour Health Prize. Black was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh in 1980. In 1982 Black was awarded the Wolf Prize in Medicine,[9] and the year after the Scheele Award. He was awarded the 1988 Nobel Prize in Medicine along with Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitchings for their work on drug development.[22] In 1994 he received the Ellison-Cliffe Medal from the Royal Society of Medicine and in 2004 the Royal Medal from the Royal Society. In 2008, he was Awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Medical Futures Innovation Awards, accompanied by his wife Professor Rona Mackie Black, in front of a distinguished audience of one thousand guests.[23]/nIn the town of Lochgelly, Fife, there is a street called Sir James Black Gait./nOn 23 November 2018, the University of Glasgow renamed the West Medical Building in honour of Black. Professor Sir Anton Muscatelli, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Glasgow, said: \u201cSir James was undoubtedly one of the greatest scientists of the modern age.

He described her as the \"mainspring\" of his life until she died aged 61 in Surrey.[6][24] The couple had a daughter, Stephanie, born in 1951.[6] Black remarried in 1994, to Professor Rona MacKie.[9] Black was a very private man who was averse to publicity and was horrified to discover he had won the Nobel Prize.[9]/nBlack died, aged 85, on the morning of 22 March 2010 after a long illness. His death was announced by the University of Dundee, where Black served as Chancellor from 1992 to 2006.[25] His funeral was held on 29 March at St. Columba's Church, London.[10] He is buried at the Ardclach cemetery, a parish established in 1655, near Nairn, Scotland. Upon hearing of Black's death, Professor Pete Downes, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Dundee said Black \"was a great scientist, but he was also a great man to know\" while the BBC said he was \"hailed as one of the great Scottish scientists of the 20th Century\".[19] He was described by The Daily Telegraph as the man who earned the most for the pharmaceutical industry through his drug development, though he received little personal financial gain from his work.[9]/nShortly after his death the Bute Medical School of the University of St Andrews, where Black had studied for his initial degree in medicine, announced that an honorary 'Sir James Black Chair of Medicine' would be created.[26] In September 2010 the first Chair of Medicine at the University was given to Professor Stephen H Gillespie MD, DSc, FRCP (Edin), FRC Path, who left his post as Professor of Medical Microbiology at UCL.[citation needed]", "33400335": "John Roger Roth (born 14 March 1939)[2] is an American geneticist, bacterial physiologist, and evolutionist.

Kornblihtt was elected as a foreign associate of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States in 2011, received the Diamond Award for the most relevant scientist of Argentina of the decade, alongside physicist Juan Martin Maldacena, in 2013,[1] and was incorporated to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences of France in 2022./nKornblihtt is married, with two adult sons. Outside of his research, Kornblihtt appreciates the opportunity to teach undergraduate biology students at the University of Buenos Aires. In his free time, Kornblihtt enjoys cooking, classical music, numerous genres of literature, etymology, and is a life-long lover of cinema.[2]/nAlberto Kornblihtt was born on June 30, 1954, in Buenos Aires, Argentina.[1] His parents taught mathematics and geography, providing Kornblihtt and his two siblings, who also pursued careers in science and education, with an environment for knowledge and learning at an early age. When he was 16 years old, Kornblihtt enrolled in a high school botany and biology class instructed by Rosa Guaglianone, allowing Kornblihtt the opportunity to perform laboratory and microscopy work. This experience launched Kornblihtt's interest in DNA and mRNA. Following high school, Kornblihtt continued his education at the Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales (School of Sciences) of the University of Buenos Aires, earning a Biology degree in 1977. In 1980, Kornblihtt went on to earn his PhD in biochemistry from Campomar Foundation in Buenos Aires, under the mentorship of H\u00e9ctor Torres. Kornblihtt then relocated to Oxford, where he held a postdoctoral position from 1981 through 1984 at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology. Kornblihtt worked with Professor Francisco Barralle during his postdoctoral research, and together, they were successful in cloning the human fibronectin gene.[1] They determined that fibronectin, an important glycoprotein for cell adhesion and tissue repair,[3] was alternatively spliced and could result in the generation of twenty polypeptides.[4]/nAfter completing his postdoctoral research in Oxford, Kornblihtt returned to Argentina in 1984 and accepted a position as an assistant professor of molecular and cell biology at Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales at the University of Buenos Aires. In 1991 he was appointed full professor and at present he is professor emeritus. Kornblihtt is also a senior CONICET investigator of the CONICET and works with a research team to study the regulation of alternative ribonucleic acid splicing. Alternative splicing occurs during gene expression, allowing exons from a gene to be excluded or included, resulting in a single gene generating multiple proteins. Major projects in Kornblihtt's lab focus on: 1) Coupling transcription with alternative splicing; 2) Alternative splicing and Chromatin; 3) Alternative splicing and spinal muscular atrophy; 4) Ultraviolet light irradiation and alternative splicing; and 5) Alternative splicing in plants.[1][5]/nKornblihtt's lab focuses on the mechanisms that couple transcription with alternative splicing for the regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Transcription is the process in which a genetic sequence of a gene is transcribed, or changed, from DNA into RNA, to allow for protein production.[6] One of the most significant accomplishments in Kornblihtt's research came in 1997. Kornblihtt's research team was able to an alternative splicing assay combined with promoter swapping to demonstrate that transcription promoters affect the outcome of splicing [7] They later determined that the coupling of transcription and splicing is dependent upon transcriptional elongation speed, or kinetic coupling, and the impact of transcribing RNA polymerase II on splicing.[8][9] Kornblihtt's research has found that elongation affects alternative splicing events, with slow elongation increasing inclusion of approximately 80% of exons and skipping of approximately 20% in mammalian cells.[5][10]/nAn additional area of Kornblihtt's study investigated the impact of chromatin structure on alternative splicing. Kornblihtt's research team demonstrated that alternative splicing is impacted by chromatin structure and the rate of transcription.[11] They found that a tighter chromatin structure provides lower rates of elongation and looser chromatin structures provide a higher rate of elongation of transcription.[5] These studies further contributed to the relationship between alternative splicing and epigenetics, which Kornblihtt's team used in studying potential therapies for Skeletal Muscular Atrophy./nSpinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a hereditary degenerative disease of the central nervous system resulting from a spinal motor neuron (SMN) protein shortage.[12][13] This is due to the deletion or mutation of Survival of Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1). Due to the faulty SMN1 gene, SMA patients do not have enough SMN protein. SMA patients must depend on Survivor of Motor Neurons 2 (SMN2), a gene that all humans have. SMN2 cannot produce sufficient full-length protein for the motor neurons to signal muscles due to sequence differences and the exclusion of exon 7, resulting in the overall SMN protein deficiency.[2][12] As a treatment strategy for SMA, the first FDA-approved drug, known as Spinraza was developed by Dr. Adrian Krainer and his Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory colleagues.[14] Spinraza is an oligonucleotide that works to activate SMN2 to make more SMN protein in SMA patients.[15][16] In 2015, the families of Spinal Muscular Atrophy patients encouraged Kornblihtt and Krainer to work together to improve the effectiveness of Spinraza or to develop alternative therapies to be used in conjunction with Spinraza. Kornblihtt's research team focuses on epigenetic strategies, a different mechanism than used Spinraza, to increase SMN protein from the SMN2 gene.[17] Epigenetics studies changes in gene expression, without alteration to the DNA sequence.[18] In 2017 and 2019, Kornblihtt received three separate grants from CURE SMA and FAME (Families of SMA, Argentina) to support continued work on his projects \u201cEpigenetics in SMN2 E7 Alternative Splicing\u201d and \u201cEpigenetics in SMN2 E7 Alternative Splicing II\u201d.[19][20] In these projects, Kornblihtt's team has worked on the regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing to develop new mechanisms for SMN protein development, using a single gene to generate multiple proteins.[19][20] Kornblihtt's lab continues to work on the SMN2 gene for SMA therapy that focus specifically on exon 7 inclusion to work in conjunction with oligonucleotide treatments, such as Spinraza.[2]/nAs a continuation of their longterm research on alternative splicing, Kornblihtt's team also studied the impact DNA damage induced by Ultraviolet light (UV) irradiation on alternative splicing in human skin cells. Their research demonstrated that the DNA-damage response to sunlight causes phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase and slowing of the enzyme. Through their research, they found that UV irradiation is necessary to trigger the alternative splicing of many genes and promoting the death of damaged or mutated cells.[21]/nAdding to their research performed on human cells, Kornblihtt's team expanded their research to study transcription and alternative splicing in plants. The plant Arabidopsis thaliana was used to investigate how external lighting conditions affected alternative splicing. Research showed that the chloroplast, where photosynthesis occurs, senses light and sends a signal to the cell nucleus to regulate alternative splicing.[22] As previously found in mammalian cells, Kornblihtt's team demonstrated that alternative splicing in plants responds to the kinetic coupling mechanism. Their research further showed that light promotes elongation in RNA polymerase II (Pol II) while elongation is lowered in darkness.[22][23]", "370257": "Alfred Newton FRS HFRSE (11 June 1829\u00a0\u2013 7 June 1907) was an English zoologist and ornithologist. Newton was Professor of Comparative Anatomy at Cambridge University from 1866 to 1907. Among his numerous publications were a four-volume Dictionary of Birds (1893\u20136), entries on ornithology in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (9th edition)[1] while also an editor of the journal Ibis from 1865 to 1870. In 1900 he was awarded the Royal Medal of the Royal Society and the Gold Medal of the Linnaean Society. He founded the British Ornithologists Union./nAlfred Newton was born near Geneva[2] in Switzerland, the fifth son of William Newton of Elveden Hall in Suffolk, Member of Parliament (MP) for Ipswich; his mother Elizabeth (1789\u20131843) was the daughter of Richard Slater Milnes, MP for York. The family wealth was founded on sugar plantations in the Caribbean, where Alfred's grandfather Samuel Newton had a plantation in St Kitts, and a property in St Croix. William Newton returned to England in 1813, purchasing the property of Elveden, near Thetford from the Earl of Albemarle.[3][4] Elveden (pronounced and sometimes spelt 'Eldon') was built in 1770 by Admiral Augustus Keppel. After the Newtons left, Elveden Hall and its estate were bought by Prince Duleep Singh in 1863, and later by the Guinness family (Earl of Iveagh).[5]/nIn 1828 the Newton family made a trip to Italy, and on the way back Alfred was born on 11 June 1829 at Les D\u00e9lices, a chateau near Geneva. He suffered an accident when about five or six, which left him somewhat lame in one leg. He went to school in 1844, attending Mr. Walker's school at Stetchworth near Newmarket. He kept birds in cages and looked after other animals from a young age.[6][4]/nAs a youth Newton shot game birds \u2013 black or red grouse, common pheasant, partridge. Birds became an abiding interest. Those included the great bustard (Otis tarda), Montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus), ravens, buzzards (Buteo sp.), redpolls, wrynecks (Jynx), which are small woodpeckers that specialise in feeding on ants. \"The vast warrens of the 'Breck', the woods and water-meadows of the valley of the Little Ouse, and the neighbouring Fenland made an ideal training-ground for a naturalist\".[7] This enthusiasm Newton shared with his younger brother Edward: the two carried out bird observation when they were together and corresponded when they were apart.[8]/nIn 1846 Newton went to a tutor in Biggleswade for a few months, and in 1848 he entered Magdalene College, Cambridge. He graduated B.A. in 1853.[9] He took a particular interest in zoology and corresponded with many ornithologists of the time. A meeting with John Wolley at Cambridge in 1851 made them lifelong friends. He spent the rest of his life at Magdalene, and never married. A fall later in life, when he was on a trip to Heligoland, further crippled him, and he then walked with the aid of two sticks, instead of one, as formerly. \"From a three-legged, he has become a four-legged man\" commented a friend.[10]/nNewton died on 7 June 1907 of heart failure at the Old Lodge in Magdalene. He is buried in the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge.[4]/nIn 1853 he was awarded the Drury Travelling Fellowship of Magdalene College, but he took it up only in 1855, when the grant became available. Between 1855 and 1864 he visited many parts of the world, including Lapland, Iceland, Spitsbergen, the West Indies and North America.[11] In 1858 he made a trip to Iceland with John Wolley with the hope of rediscovering the great auk.[12] Shortly after their return Wolley died, and at the suggestion of P.L. Sclater Newton wrote up Wolley's notes and catalogued his collection in Ootheca Wolleyana, which was published in four parts from 1864 to 1907. In 1866 he became the first Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at Cambridge, a position which he retained until his death.[11] His portrait still hangs in the library of the University's Department of Zoology. Newton was also a founding editor of the Journal of Anatomy and Physiology in 1867.[13] He was one of the few British Professors of Zoology of his time in whose appointment Huxley did not have a hand. Both Darwin and Huxley declined to support his application, on the grounds that his interests and publications were too narrowly focussed on ornithology.[14] The procedure was for candidates to canvass for votes (presumably amongst the MAs of the University).[15] The result of the poll was Newton 110; Dr Drosier 82.[16] Newton was one of the first zoologists to accept and champion the views of Charles Darwin, and his early lecture courses as professor were on evolution and zoogeography.[17]/nNewton was a leader in founding the British Ornithologists' Union in 1858, and its quarterly journal, the Ibis in 1859. He wrote several books including Zoology (1872) and A Dictionary of Birds (1893\u20131896). He contributed memoirs to scientific societies, and edited the Ibis (1865\u20131870), the Zoological Record (1870\u20131872), and Yarrell's British Birds (1871\u20131882). His services to ornithology and zoogeography were recognized by the Royal Society in 1900, when it awarded him the Royal Medal.[11]/nNewton spent some time studying the vanishing birds of the Mascarene Islands, from where his brother Sir Edward Newton sent him specimens. These included the dodo on Mauritius and the solitaire on Rodrigues, both already extinct.[18][19][20] In 1872 he described what is now known as Newton's parakeet which lived on Rodrigues before going extinct in 1875.[21]\nThe specific epithet of Genyornis newtoni, a prehistoric bird described in 1896 by Edward Charles Stirling and A. H. C. Zietz, commemorates this author.[22]/nNewton's interest in extinct bird species such as the dodo, great auk and great bustard led him to work towards the protection of birds. He influenced the legislation of the Sea Birds Preservation Act 1869. Newton was a prominent supporter and member of the Society for the Protection of Birds (later, 1903, the RSPB) from its inception in 1889, and carried on a long campaign to influence women against the fashion of adorning their hats with the flight feathers of raptors and other fine birds. His letters to The Times and addresses to the British Association for the Advancement of Science meetings on this subject were regularly reprinted as pamphlets by the Society.[23][4] Newton determined that extinction cause by human actions was different from extinction resulting from natural processes including evolution. He made efforts to clarify that his motivations for conservation were scientific and that these were distinct from sentiments influenced by earlier movements against animal cruelty and vivisection.[24]/nOne of his most successful works was a series of investigations into the Desirability of establishing a 'Close-time' for the preservation of indigenous animals. These were instigated and published by the British Association between 1872 and 1903, leading towards the present-day legislation concerning the closed seasons for game fish, shell-fish, birds and mammals (Game laws). The basic concept, as is now well known, is to protect animals during their breeding season so as to prevent the stock from being brought close to extinction.[25][26]/nThe Cambridge University Museum of Zoology contains a significant amount of material from Newton, including specimens collected in Madagascar, Polynesia, South America and the Caribbean, eggs, books and correspondence.[27]/nNewton's correspondence gives an intimate view of how he encountered the momentous idea of evolution by means of natural selection:/nNot many days after my return home there reached me the part of the Journal of the Linnean Society which bears on its cover the date 20th August 1858, and contains the papers by Mr Darwin and Mr Wallace, which were communicated to that Society at its special meeting of the first of July preceding... I sat up late that night to read it; and never shall I forget the impression it made upon me. Herein was contained a perfectly simple solution of all the difficulties which had been troubling me for months past... I am free to confess that in my joy I did not then perceive that... dozens of other difficulties lay in the path... but I was convinced a vera causa [true cause] had been found... and I never doubted for one moment, then nor since, that we had one of the grandest discoveries of the age\u2014a discovery all the more grand because it was so simple.[28]/nOnly four days after the publication of the famous 1858 paper, and one day after he read it, Newton started to apply Darwin's and Wallace's idea to various problems in ornithology.[29] Newton did not see evolutionary theory as being in conflict with his religion. He maintained a regular attendance at church and held deeply conservative views. Evolutionary theory was, for him, applicable outside of humans.[24]/nThe British Association annual meeting for 1860, held in the University Museum in Oxford, was the location for one of the most important public debates in 19th century biology. Newton was present and left a record of what happened in a letter to his brother Edward. The famous debate between Huxley and Wilberforce took place on Saturday 30 June 1860 and in his letter Newton writes:/nIn the Nat. Hist. Section we had another hot Darwinian debate... After [lengthy preliminaries] Huxley was called upon by Henslow to state his views at greater length, and this brought up the Bp. of Oxford... Referring to what Huxley had said two days before, about after all its not signifying to him whether he was descended from a Gorilla or not, the Bp. chafed him and asked whether he had a preference for the descent being on the father's side or the mother's side? This gave Huxley the opportunity of saying that he would sooner claim kindred with an Ape than with a man like the Bp. who made so ill an use of his wonderful speaking powers to try and burke, by a display of authority, a free discussion on what was, or was not, a matter of truth, and reminded him that on questions of physical science 'authority' had always been bowled out by investigation, as witness astronomy and geology.He then caught hold of the Bp's assertions and showed how contrary they were to facts, and how he knew nothing about what he had been discoursing on. A lot of people afterwards spoke... The feeling of the audience was very much against the Bp.[30]/nA letter, dated 25 July 1860, provides an account of the debate.[31]/nNewton was also present at the Cambridge meeting of the British Association two years later. Ever since 1857 when Richard Owen presented (to the Linnean Society) his view that man was marked off from all other mammals by possessing features of the brain peculiar to the genus Homo, Huxley had been on his trail. The issue had been debated at the British Association in 1860 and 1861 (Manchester). At the 1862 Cambridge meeting Huxley arranged for his friend William Flower to give a public dissection to show that the same structures were indeed present, not only in apes, but in monkeys also. Flower stood up and said \"I happen to have in my pocket a monkey's brain\" \u2014 and produced the object in question! (report in the Times). In a letter to his brother Newton wrote:/nThere was a grand kick-up again between Owen and Huxley, the former struggling against facts with a devotion worthy of a better cause.

One summer, she did research at Woods Hole Biological Laboratories.[5] Further research was carried on at the Zoological Station, Naples, Italy, in 1909, as scholar of the American Women's Table association. During her year or two abroad, she made a study of educational institutions on the continent of Europe, and in England, with special reference to methods of teaching, an experience which formed a valuable background for her later lecture courses.

A telling report of her work in this connection was published in the bulletin of the American Academy of Medicine. While teaching, she hosted occasional lecturers from women's clubs and teachers' associations, including the Wisconsin Academy of Science and the Wisconsin State Teachers' Association. The lecturers discussed such methods of teaching biology that the subjects of reproduction, as well as of growth, were developed, together with reasons for a social rather than an individualistic attitude toward life and living. She dedicated increasing attention to this phase of her career, finding in it the more universal medium of personal contact, and the Morse significant way of \"putting across\" her individual ideas.

It had some importance due to its geographical location, serving as the entrance to the region of Jibal as well as a crossroad between the culture of Iran and that of the inhabitants on the other side of the Zagros Mountains. The birth date of Dinawari is uncertain; it is likely that he was born during the first or second decade of the 9th-century.[11] He was instructed in the two main traditions of the Abbasid-era grammarians of al-Ba\u1e63rah and of al-K\u016bfah. His principal teachers were Ibn al-Sikk\u012bt and his own father.[n 1]  He studied grammar, philology, geometry, arithmetic, and astronomy and was known to be a reliable traditionalist.[12] His most renowned contribution is the Book of Plants, for which he is considered the founder of Arabic botany.[13]/nDinawari's Kit\u0101b al-akhb\u0101r al-\u1e6diw\u0101l (General History), written from a Persian point of view,[14] is possibly the earliest apparent effort to combine Iranian and Islamic history.[15] While historians such as al-Tabari and Bal'ami devoted the introduction of their work to long discourses on the duration of the world, Dinawari attempted to establish the importance of Iranshahr (\"land of Iran\") as the centre of the world.[16] In his work, Dinawari notably devoted much less space to the Islamic prophet Muhammad compared to that of Iran. Regardless, Dinawari was a devoted Muslim, as indicated by his commentary on the Qur'an. He concluded the history with the suppression of Babak Khorramdin's rebellion in 837, and the subsequent execution of the Iranian general Khaydhar ibn Kawus al-Afshin.[17]/nBesides having access to early Arabic sources, Dinawari also made use of Persian sources, including pre-Islamic epic romances.

Despite his work in the field, the cause of his son's disability was never diagnosed.[6]  In 1958, Guthrie's 15-month-old niece was diagnosed with phenylketonuria (PKU), a condition in which the body cannot metabolize phenylalanine.  Untreated PKU results in irreversible neurological damage.[1]  After the discovery of PKU as a cause of mental retardation, Horst Bickel and colleagues discovered that it could be treated successfully with a diet low in phenylalanine.[7]  The main drawback in successful treatment of PKU was the delay in identifying affected individuals.  The common test for PKU at the time was mixing urine with ferric chloride.  The excess phenylpyruvic acid in the urine of an individual with PKU would produce a bright green colour when reacting with the ferric chloride.  Infants do not excrete high enough concentrations of this compound to give a positive test result, thus delaying their diagnosis, and allowing irreversible damage to take place.[1]  Guthrie's disabled son had driven his interest in causes of mental retardation, the diagnosis of his niece with PKU turned his attention to preventable causes.  Others working with children who had PKU asked Guthrie to focus on a test that would allow for earlier identification, before irreversible damage had taken place.[1]/nGuthrie developed a simple method to screen for elevated phenylalanine levels using a bacterial inhibition assay. He cultured Bacillus subtilis on agar in the presence of a phenylalanine antagonist, inhibiting the growth.  When exposed to blood from patients affected with PKU, the high levels of phenylalanine overcame the inhibition, and bacterial growth was visible.[1]  This assay was initially developed to allow monitoring of phenylalanine concentrations in known patients on dietary treatment using serum spotted onto filter paper.  Guthrie recognized both the utility of this method as a screening test, and the need to eliminate serum as the sample type to minimize processing.  He tested the assay using whole blood collected on filter paper from a heel stick.[1]  The collection of whole blood on special filter paper developed by Guthrie is still used in newborn screening programs around the world, allowing babies to be screened shortly after birth for a number of treatable conditions.[8]/nAfter establishing a test that could identify PKU in whole blood spots,[9] Guthrie set out to test his method, starting in an institution in New York.  Here, his test correctly identified all patients known to have PKU and also four who had previously been undiagnosed.[1]  In 1961, Guthrie and his lab started screening infants for PKU, a project that quickly expanded.  In two years, they had tested 400,000 American newborns, and diagnosed 39 with PKU.  This early diagnosis allowed for early treatment and avoidance of the most severe consequences of the disease.[1]  Throughout the 1960s, PKU testing expanded in the United States and around the world, eventually becoming required by law in many jurisdictions.[1]  With the success of PKU testing, Guthrie and his colleagues focused on screening tests for other diseases that can affect newborns.  They developed bacterial inhibition assays for galactosemia and maple syrup urine disease that could be run using the same sample collection as the PKU test.[10]/nGuthrie decided that commercial production would be the most efficient way to manufacture 400,000 test kits, so he approached the Ames Company, a division of Miles Laboratories, which manufactured the older PKU tests. Ames said it would only manufacture the kits if a patent was issued, so Guthrie filed a patent application in 1962 and signed an exclusive licensing agreement with Miles, under which he would receive no royalties and 5% of the proceeds would be divided among the National Association for Retarded Children Research Fund, the Association for Aid of Crippled Children, and the University of Buffalo Foundation.[11]/nMiles couldn't produce the kits fast enough, so Guthrie produced his own kits for 500 tests at a cost of $6 each. But in 1963, he found out that Ames planned to charge $262 for the same kit.[11]/nGuthrie was appalled, but Ames wouldn't lower their price. Guthrie appealed to the U.S. Children's Bureau, which sponsored the field trial, and the Children's Bureau recommended that Miles not be granted exclusive commercial rights. Most of the funding to develop the tests had come from the Children's Bureau ($742,0000) and the Public Health Service ($251,700). The surgeon general determined that the invention belonged to the United States and abrogated the exclusive licensing agreement.[11]/nThe dispute was the subject of a May, 1965 hearing by the Monopoly Subcommittee of the Select Committee on Small Business of the U.S. Senate. Committee chair Russell B. Long (D-LA) denounced the award of private patent rights on federally funded research, and said, \"when the desire to make monopoly profits at the public's expense can adversely affect the health of our children, it is time to call a halt to this immoral and evil practice.\"[11]/nOne of the defenders of Ames was Senator Birch Bayh (D-IN), who, with Senator Robert Dole (R-KS), in 1980 introduced the Bayh\u2013Dole Act which allowed universities and small businesses to retain ownership of inventions developed with federal funding.[11]/nPKU Day/nFor the 100th birthday of Robert Guthrie the European Society for Phenylketonuria and Allied Disorders Treated as Phenylketonuria invited Patricia Guthrie to the annual conference[12] to give a speech about her father.

He used bacterial genetics to identify a series of molecular determinants involved in the biofilm formation process, notably extracellular appendages, or fimbriae, he called Cup.

He discovered many T6SS toxins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and described how these could be transported in target bacteria notably by being placed at the tip of the molecular arrowhead.[6]/nOne such example is VgrG2b, which contains a metallopeptidase domain targeting, in the prey bacteria, proteins involved in cell wall integrity and cell division.[6] Bacterial preys will then collapse, as they do for example when treated with \u0392eta-lactam antibiotics.[6] Filloux also carried on studying biofilms, and gained interest in a central switch which involves the universal second messenger cyclic-di-GMP. It was known that high levels of c-di-GMP in bacterial cells turns on biofilm development, and Filloux showed that concomitantly high c-di-GMP levels turned on the T6SS. This suggested that the T6SS is put in place when cells enter a phase allowing polymicrobial communities to establish and is thus prepared to eliminate foes.[6]/nWhile continuing studying protein secretion and biofilm formation, Filloux gained interest investigating antibiotic resistance.[7][8] He collaborated with Dr Gerald Larrouy-Maumus on the development of a protocol for rapid antibiotic resistance screening using mass spectrometry.[9]/nFilloux has served as an editor for several scientific journals.[4][10] Filloux was appointed Editor-in-Chief for FEMS Microbiology Reviews in 2013.[4] He was appointed Editor-in-Chief for npj Biolfilms and Microbiomes, which is part of the Nature Partner Journals series, in 2018.[10][11]/nFilloux has held several scientific administrative positions including membership of the BBSRC - Research Grants Committee B (2009-2011).[12][13]", "17081982": "Incheol Shin is a South Korean cancer researcher and, since 2005, a faculty member at the Department of Life Science, College of Natural Science, Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

She was one of the pioneers in this field, documenting the phenomenon of penicillin resistance early on./nBarber was born on 3 April 1911[1] in Derby. Her mother was Ethel Howlett and her father, a physician, was Hugh Barber; the couple had two daughters before Mary.[2] She was the only daughter to go into medicine; she was a fifth-generation physician.[3] Barber received her early education at the Alice Ottley School in Worcester. For most of her life, she lived in a London flat; she never married.[2]  She died on 11 September 1965[1] at the age of 54. She and a companion were killed in a car accident while en route to a Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament meeting. Throughout her life Barber possessed strong political and religious beliefs, as a firm political liberal and devout Anglican.[4][2] She was known for her distinctive appearance, including glasses, no makeup, a pulled-back hairstyle, and utilitarian clothing. Her hobbies included boating.[2]/nEducated at the London School of Medicine for Women, she received her joint degree from the school and the Royal Free Hospital in 1934 and her M.B. B.S. two years later.[2] While studying for her M.D., Barber held several different academic positions. From 1936 to 1937, she was a resident assistant in the Pathology Unit of the Royal Free Hospital. The next year, she was named the A. M. Bird Scholar in Pathology. In 1938, she moved to the Archway Group Laboratory, where she was an assistant pathologist until 1939; that year, she took the same position at Hill End and the City Hospitals, St. Albans. After she received her M.D. in 1940, Barber became a lecturer of bacteriology and assistant pathologist at the British Postgraduate Medical School and Hammersmith Hospital, positions she held until 1948. From 1948 to 1958, she was a reader in bacteriology at St. Thomas's Hospital. In 1958, she returned to the British Postgraduate Medical School to be a reader in clinical bacteriology; in 1963, she became a professor, a position she held until 1965.[1]/nBarber's research was focused on the staphylococcus bacterium as well as various aspects of antibiotics, especially development of penicillin-resistant bacteria. Her first scientific paper was published in 1937 and concerned meningitis caused by the Listeria bacterium. In 1947, she published her best-known work, on penicillin resistance in staphylocci,[5] proving that the bacteria were becoming more resistant to the drug over time,[1] using the new technique of phage typing.[6] She found that this was because bacteria with mutations that caused them to synthesize a penicillin-destroying enzyme were selected during treatment with antibiotics, leading to rapid spread of a single antibiotic-resistant strain throughout the hospital.[2] Between 1948 and 1958, her focus shifted to cross-infection by Staphylococcus in hospitals,[1] which she found to be caused by penicillin-resistant bacteria and the nurses became nasal carriers soon after working on the wards. After she returned to BPMS (British Postgraduate Medical School) in 1958, she expanded upon this work, making a clear case for limiting antibiotic use and combining drugs for maximum effect and minimal increases in drug resistance;[4] these studies were carried out at St. Thomas' Hospital. The policies implemented as a result of her work caused antibiotic resistance observed in the hospital to drop dramatically.[2] After her successful publications, Barber was hired by the Medical Research Council to study semisynthetic penicillin, cephalosporin, fucidin, lincomycin, and pristinamycin.[4] In 1963, she published Antibiotic and Chemotherapy with L. P. Garrod, an encyclopaedic work on the characteristics and medical uses of various antibiotics.[4][2] That same year, Barber was appointed a professor; in 1965 she was elected to the Royal College of Physicians.[2]/nThroughout her career, Barber was known for being a conscientious and intelligent scientist.[3]", "43558544": "Hope Black (n\u00e9e MacPherson, 1919 \u2013 25 January 2018) was an Australian scientist, a marine biologist and malacologist.[1][2] In 1937 she started working at the National Museum of Victoria.

He graduated from high school in 1937 as valedictorian of his class.[3]/nWith the help of local African-American businessmen active in the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, who had been impressed with his academic performance in high school, Taylor was able to attend the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,[3] earning a bachelor's degree in bacteriology in 1941.[4] At the university, Taylor was a Reserve Officers' Training Corps cadet.[5]/nWhen World War II broke out, Taylor enlisted in the U.S. Army, serving in the South Pacific theater of operations as a liaison pilot for the Army Field Artillery, that is, using air surveillance to help direct field artillery fire.[6] His unit was the 93rd Infantry Division,[3] a segregated unit that had already fought in World War I.[7]/nAfter the war, Taylor returned to his alma mater on the G.I. Bill to complete his M.S. degree in the same subject in 1947, and a PhD degree in 1948.[4] For his PhD, Taylor studied \"The growth and toxin production of Clostridium botulinum in cottage cheese\".[8]/nThroughout his career, including his service in an army that was, at the time, still subject to Jim Crow rules, Taylor was confronted with anti-black racism. He recounts a number of such confrontations in the memoirs he wrote on his time in the army, published in 2012.[6] As a civil rights activist, Taylor promoted racial equality, including work with white veterans in Urbana-Champaign with the aim of de-segregating restaurants, movie theaters and public swimming pools.[2] Taylor was one of the first African Americans to integrate Chicago's Chatham neighborhood, serving as president of the Chatham Avalon Park Community Council.[3]/nTaylor married Jayne Rowena Kemp in 1945, and had two daughters, whose names are Karyn and Shelley. Taylor and Jayne were married for many years until Jayne passed away in 2005.[3]/nIn 1948, Taylor joined the faculty at the University of Illinois College of Medicine. As research subjects, he chose gas gangrene and tetanus, both of which were infections relevant to the military as complications of soldiers' wounds.[3] Taylor and his colleague Milan Novak found that penicillin could be used as prophylaxis for both diseases.[9][10][11]/nBetween 1954 and 1959, Taylor worked at the food processing company Swift & Company. When there was an outbreak of salmonella at the company, Taylor, with his colleague John Silliker, developed an accurate test that could be used to test egg yolks for salmonella. The testing method is still in use today.[1] Taylor and Silliker jointly took out a patent on a new method of destroying food-borne bacteria using bacteriophages in 1959.[12]/nIn 1959, Taylor left the company to take up a post as Microbiologist-in-Chief at Chicago's Children's Memorial Hospital.[3]\nWith a Special Research Fellowship from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Taylor spent 1961 at Britain's Central Public Health Laboratory in Colindale and France's Pasteur Institute in Lille, helping to develop procedures aimed at preventing salmonella poisoning caused by meat imports.[3][1]/nUpon his return to Children's Memorial Hospital in 1962, Taylor went on to develop rapid testing methods for two more classes of bacteria known to cause food poisoning, notably Shigellae \u2013 one of the leading bacterial causes of diarrhea worldwide \u2013 and Enterobacteriaceae, obtaining several patents. The methods he developed were adopted internationally as part of the ongoing effort to keep processed food safe.[13] Taylor acted as a consultant for eleven Chicago-area hospitals, seven corporations, three government agencies, as well as for the Center for Disease Control on subjects ranging from toxic shock syndrome and Legionnaire's disease to sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS.[3]/nIn 1965, Taylor developed the XLD agar, which can be used to isolate Salmonella and Shigella bacterial species both from clinical samples and from food.[14] This agar remains a standard diagnostic tool of clinical microbiology, and is particularly well-suited for routine diagnostic work on Salmonella enterica.[15]/nIn 1975, Taylor was one of the founders of the Journal of Clinical Microbiology, which is published by the American Society for Microbiology; he also served as one of the journal's editors from 1975 to 1983.[9]/nIn pursuit of his research, Taylor set about combining different culture media in a form that would allow for easy identification of different bacteria in a clinical setting. For the resulting \"Device for Use in the Identification of Microorganisms\", which includes different compartments with specific culture media allowing for accurate and fast identification, a patent was issued to Taylor on March 1, 1977.[13][16] The device was approved by the FDA as well as by food-safety regulatory agencies in Canada and in Europe as a means of certifying food as bacteria free. Taylor founded Micro-Palettes Inc. in order to commercialize devices of this type, but the company was dissolved in 1988.[13][17]/nTaylor's inventions in the area of food testing eventually led to his induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2016.[1]/nIn 1985, a group of researchers from the Center for Disease Control named a newly identified Enterobacter bacterium Enterobacter taylorae in honor of both the British bacteriologist Joan Taylor and Welton Taylor. The citation reads \"The name also honors Welton Taylor, an American clinical microbiologist who has also made many contributions to our knowledge of the family Enterobacteriaceae, particularly the development of the XLD agar and the isolation of Shigella and other bacterial pathogens from feces.[18]", "8365797": "Hubert Chantrenne (1918\u20132007) was a Belgian scientist, and one of the pioneers of molecular biology at the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles.

In 1988, the University of Southern California (USC) recruited Kedes to spearhead a campus-wide initiative to strengthen their molecular biology and genetics research programs. At USC, Kedes conceived and developed the Institute of Genetic Medicine,[2] becoming its founding director (1989-2008) as well as the William Keck Professor (1988-2009) and Chair (1988-2002) of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.[3]/nKedes attended Weaver High School[4] in Hartford, Connecticut, and then earned his BS in biology from Stanford University in 1961 after completing 3 years (1957-1959) of undergraduate studies at Wesleyan University, which later recognized him as a Distinguished Alumnus, awarding him an honorary bachelor's of arts degree (2009).[5] Kedes earned his medical degree from Stanford University Medical School (1958-1962) and then completed his internship and junior year of residency in internal medicine at the University of Pittsburgh (1962-1964), followed by two years of research at the Laboratory of Biochemistry and Biology Branch,[6] within the National Cancer Institute (1964-1966). Following a senior residency year at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Kedes joined the laboratory of Paul R. Gross at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, completing his postdoctoral research fellowship.[7][8] Supported by a Leukemia Society award, he then worked for one year (1969-1970) in Europe, most notably with embryologist, Alberto Monroy, and molecular biologist Max Birnstiel.[9]/nKedes was recruited by Stanford University (1970-1989), where he was promoted to the rank of full professor and became the institution's first investigator supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (1974-1982).[10] While at Stanford, he founded IntelliGenetics (later IntelliCorp) (1980-1987), the first company focused on designing and applying computer programs, expert systems, and artificial intelligence for the analysis of DNA sequences. There, Kedes held the positions of Senior Scientist and Chairman./nIn 1989, Kedes moved to University of Southern California (USC) where he conceptualized, obtained extramural funding for, and oversaw the design and building of the Institute of Genetic Medicine (IGM).[2] The institute followed a collaborative model and Kedes recruited 20 faculty to the IGM during his tenure as its founding director.

His published work has over 23,000 citations with two papers receiving over 1000 citations each and over 45 receiving over 100 citations each, as of 2016.[12]/nKedes was a notable figure in skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle molecular genetics, contributing to molecular biology and gene expression for over four decades. Among his achievements were the first isolation of a protein-coding gene from an animal cell and the determination of the DNA sequence of a protein-coding animal gene.[15][16] Initially, his research focused on the chromosomal arrangement, sequences, and regulation of the multi-gene family encoding histone proteins, which later played a role in controlling overall gene expression. In a subsequent phase, he investigated the regulation of actin genes, identifying evolutionary conserved elements within non-coding regions of mRNA 3' ends.[17] Kedes predicted that these regions were likely targets of post-transcriptional regulation, a prediction that proved correct (see histone code). [18][19] (See, for example, microRNA, AU-rich element, three prime untranslated region)./nIn the third phase of his research, Kedes turned his attention to muscle gene expression and myocyte differentiation and transdifferentiation, including early forays into cardiac gene therapy.[20] He was also a developer of the first federally funded digital web-based database for storing and analyzing DNA sequences,[21][22] laying the foundation, along with the Los Alamos National Laboratory, for the development of subsequent NIH databases, including GenBank at the NCBI. Seeing the need to develop sophisticated expert systems to analyze increasingly complex sets of DNA databases, Kedes initiated collaborations with fellow Stanford University molecular biologist Douglas Brutlag and computer scientists Peter Friedland and Edward Feigenbaum and sought and obtained federal funding to establish a pre-internet era resource to share openly both the DNA sequence data and the mainframe computer aided analysis software in a program that they named Bionet.[23] These four faculty, together, formed Intelligenetics,[24] which was the first entity that managed Bionet./nThe son of Rosalyn and Samuel Kedes, Larry Kedes was born in Hartford, Connecticut.

Clark was a pioneer in the field of scuba diving for research purposes. In addition to being regarded as an authority in marine biology, Clark was popularly recognized and used her fame to promote marine conservation./nEugenie Clark was born and raised in New York City. Her father, Charles Clark, died when Eugenie was almost two years old, and her mother, Yumico Motomi, later married Japanese restaurant owner Masatomo Nobu.[1]/nClark attended elementary school in Woodside, Queens, and graduated from Bryant High School in Queens, New York.[2] She was the only student of Japanese descent in her schools.[1]/nFrom an early age, Clark was passionate about marine science, with many of her school reports covering topics in marine biology. An initial visit to the New York Aquarium at Battery Park inspired Clark to return to the aquarium every Saturday thereafter, fascinated by marine animals.[3] The work of naturalist William Beebe further inspired Clark to become an oceanographer.[4]/nEugenie Clark received a Bachelor of Arts in zoology from Hunter College (1942). During summers, she studied at the University of Michigan Biological Station, and prior to graduate school, she worked for Celanese Corporation as a chemist. Eugenie initially sought to attend graduate school at Columbia University, but her application was rejected out of fear that she would eventually choose to leave her scientific career in order to focus on raising children.[5] Undaunted, Clark went on to earn both a Master of Arts (1946) and Doctorate of Zoology (1950) from New York University. During her years of graduate study, Clark carried out research at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, the American Museum of Natural History in New York, the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory in Massachusetts, and at the Lerner Marine Laboratory in Bimini./nIn 1949, under an Office of Naval Research program to undertake scientific research in Micronesia, Clark carried out fish population studies in Guam, the Marshall Islands, the Palau islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Caroline Islands. After completing doctoral research, Clark received a Fulbright Scholarship to pursue ichthyological studies at the Marine Biological Station in Hurghada, on the northern Red Sea Coast of Egypt. These experiences were discussed in Clark's first book, Lady with a Spear (1953),[6] the writing of which was supported in part by a Eugenie Saxton Memorial Fellowship and a Breadloaf Writers' Fellowship. The book was a popular success./nAnne and William H. Vanderbilt, fans of Lady with a Spear who owned an estate in southwestern Florida, invited the biologist to speak at a public school in Englewood, Florida, in 1954.[1] After Clark delivered a presentation on Red Sea fish, the attendees revealed that they had encountered many similar animals in local waters and were interested in learning more about them. Subsequently, the Vanderbilts built a lab for Clark in the area. It was named the Cape Haze Marine Laboratory in 1955.[7]/nAt the Cape Haze Marine Laboratory, Clark worked with a local fisherman named Beryl Chadwick, who was experienced in catching sharks. Chadwick was Clark's only assistant at the time of the lab's founding. The lab's first request for shark research came from John H. Hellen, director of the New England Institute for Medical Research.[8] As the laboratory's activities began to be published in scientific journals, requests from other researchers began to pour into the lab. Researchers from around the world came to study in Cape Haze.[9]/nOne of the visiting researchers at Cape Haze Laboratory was Sylvia Earle, who was then working on her dissertation research on algae at Duke University. Earle assisted Clark in creating a herbarium by depositing duplicate specimens into the laboratory's reference collection.[1]/nWhile at Cape Haze, Clark conducted a number of behavioral, reproductive, and anatomical experiments on sharks and other fish. She frequently scuba dived in the local waters, studying various organisms. On these dives, Clark often utilized the glass jar catching technique popularized by Connie Limbaugh, then the Chief Diver at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. These jars allowed Clark to transport unknown specimens back to the lab for further study.[1]/nThe Cape Haze Laboratory moved to Siesta Key, Florida, in 1960. Scientists continued to visit the laboratory, including chemists from the Dow Chemical Company./nIn 1962, Clark participated in the Israel South Red Sea Expedition, which set up a camp on one of the Eritrean islands of the Dahlak Archipelago. Her studies focused not only on sharks but also on other, mainly large, pelagic species./nIn 1966, Clark left Cape Haze for a faculty position at the City University of New York. In 1968, she became an instructor at the University of Maryland, College Park. While at the University of Maryland, Clark received many accolades, including three fellowships, five scholarships, and six medals. Clark officially retired from the University of Maryland in 1999 but taught one class in the zoology department each semester for several years./nClark returned to the Cape Haze Laboratory, now renamed the Mote Marine Laboratory, in 2000. She worked there as Senior Scientist, Director Emerita, and Trustee until her death in Sarasota, Florida, of lung cancer on February 25, 2015.[10] Clark was an active researcher and diver throughout her entire life, conducting her last dive in 2014 and publishing its results in January 2015, with additional research still undergoing review at the time of her death.[5]/nClark was married five times, the first four ending in divorce: Jideo Umaki from 1942 to 1947, Ilias Themistokles Konstantinu from 1950 to 1967, writer Chandler Brossard from 1967 to 1969, and Igor Klatzo\nin 1970.

She was the subject of several books, including Shark Lady and Adventures of the Shark Lady by Ann McGovern. Clark was an avid supporter of marine conservation and many of her popular publications and public appearances focused on dispelling assumptions about shark behavior and intelligence in an effort to prevent the killing of sharks and encourage the preservation of marine environments. Publications from within this body of work document that she was the first person to train sharks to press targets,[12] as well as the first scientist to develop \"test tube\" babies in female fish.[13] She also discovered that the Moses sole produces a natural shark repellent, which has since been employed by researchers aiming to prevent harmful interactions between sharks and humans.[2][14] Clark's observation of numerous \"sleeping\" sharks during her research dives helped to prove sharks do not need to move in order to breathe.[11][15] Over her decades of research, Clark conducted over 70 submersible dives[2] and led more than 200 field research expeditions around the world.

Following her initial suggestion of using agar as an alternative to gelatin, they were instrumental in pioneering agar's usage as a common gelling agent for producing media capable of culturing microorganisms at high temperatures.[2]/nHesse was born in 1850 in New York City to Gottfried Eilshemius, a wealthy import merchant, and his wife, Ceclie Elise. Her family is of Dutch descent.[1] Hesse was the oldest of ten children, five of whom died early on in their lives, and they were raised at Laurel Hill Manor in North Arlington, New Jersey. She and her sisters learned about cooking and housekeeping from their mother beginning at an early age. At the age of 15, she attended a finishing school in Switzerland to study French and home economics.[1]/nHesse met her husband and research partner, Walther Hesse, in 1872 while traveling in Germany with her sister Eugenie. The couple became engaged in 1873, and they married in 1874 with a wedding held in Geneva.[3] She and her family would later live in Strehlen, a suburb of Dresden, as a result of Walther purchasing a house to work from home at during his time at the Technical University of Dresden. Referred to as Lina in her family, Hesse and her husband had 3 sons. Hesse and her brother Louis Eilshemius both shared an early interest and talent for painting and illustrations, with Louis earning some fame for his work later on in his life.[1]/nHesse would end up outliving her husband by 23 years, and her illustrations and Walther's papers have been passed down to her grandchildren as part of her personal collection. Following Walther's death, she moved into the town to be closer to her family and children for the remainder of her life. During World War I, the Hesse family home in New Jersey was sold and her part of the inheritance was kept as enemy property. It was not until many years later that she began to receive small sums of money and other items included with her inheritance, in addition to the pension she received as a widow of a civil servant. However, as her home in Dresden was destroyed during Allied air raids, many of the Hesse family mementos have been lost aside from those that Hesse managed to collect from family members.[1]/nIn addition to her housekeeping duties, Hesse worked in an unpaid capacity to assist her husband through preparing bacterial growth media, cleaning equipment, and producing illustrations for scientific publications.[3] Hesse became familiar with her husband's work over time, performing a role similar to a modern-day medical technologist.[1] She also performed a role as a scientific illustrator, drawing highly accurate watercolor images depicting each growth phase of intestinal bacterial culture when viewed under magnification, and her illustrations were included in her husband's work that was published in 1908 as part of her work in the development of medical illustration.[1] Angelina helped to coat test tubes with gelatin for her husband to use in growing microorganisms before they discovered that gelatin easily melted on warm days, destroying some of the bacteria. In addition to these technical duties, she used her artistic abilities to draw pictures of bacterial colonies as viewed under a microscope in the different phases of bacteria growth to use in her husband's journal publications.[4] At the time of her recommendation for agar as a plating medium, Hesse was also helping her husband culture air-borne bacteria.[5]/nIn 1881, while her husband was working in the laboratory of German physician and microbiologist Robert Koch, he struggled with performing experiments on gelatin medium that liquified due to gelatin-liquefying organisms and temperature increases during incubation.[6] Not only did Hesse suggest to her husband, Walther, the use of agar in his experiments, but one of her desserts served as the medium that her husband used to test the efficacy of agar as a gelling agent capable of culturing bacteria at high temperatures.[7] Before the suggestion to use agar, Walter Hesse and Koch had attempted using potato slices as a medium to culture pure colonies. Once this proved to be unsubstantial, they attempted utilizing a nutrient-rich gelatin media, which still did not provide adequate stability for producing cultures for examination.[8]/nFollowing unsuccessful attempts of culturing microorganisms on gelatin mediums, Hesse then suggested that agar was preferable to gelatin for cultivating bacteria and other microorganisms. She was aware of the properties of agar as a gelling agent, able to maintain its physical properties at warm temperatures, through her usage of it at home. Hesse had first learned about agar from her mother's friends that had lived in the East Indies, where the seaweed extract itself originates; it was commonly used there as a food ingredient.[5] She initially had been utilizing agar as a replacement for gelatin in dishes she prepared in her kitchen, finding agar more versatile in resisting summer temperatures for fruit jams and jellies, and subsequently suggested it as an alternative when Walther complained to her about gelatin breaking down in the summertime heat.[1]/nHesse's suggestion led to Walther and Koch successfully using agar as a plating medium for cultivating the bacteria that caused tuberculosis.[3][9] Hesse's suggestion of using agar also proved to be central to her husband's success in analyzing microbial counts in air, as he initially ran into problems with summertime temperatures resulting in liquefaction of gelatin. Subsequent experiments following her suggestion of using agar as an alternative gelling agent revealed its advantages in thermal stability, resistance to liquifying bacterial enzymes, ability to maintain sterility, and benefits for long term storage, which compensated for many of the problems associated with gelatin.[1] In comparison to agar, which could remain solid at temperatures up to 90\u00b0C while settling at temperatures below 45\u00b0C, gelatin liquified at 37\u00b0C, which made it an unsuitable media to plate many types of bacteria in laboratory conditions.[5] The agar \"dessert medium\" invented by Hesse, and that her husband Walther used to culture bacteria in his laboratory, had a percent composition of 1%-1.5%.[10][11] The agar that Hesse popularized does not melt below 85\u00b0C and is often observed at 100\u00b0C. The agar has a settling point of 45\u00b0C. Agar-based mediums were capable of providing a firmer media at higher temperatures, which allowed for better plating and isolation of bacterial colonies in the conditions Walther and Koch performed their experiments in.[12]/nAlthough Koch mentioned in an 1882 paper on tuberculosis bacilli that he used agar instead of gelatin, he did not credit either Hesse or mention the reasoning behind why he made the switch.[3] Later on in her life, she chose to keep and take care of all of her illustrations and Walther's papers and documents, out of respect for Walther's work and her own contributions to his discoveries. The Hesses chose to not exploit their contributions with agar commercially, citing the action as improper conduct.[1] Hesse's contribution never resulted in financial benefit for the Hesse family, but continues to remain central to the fields of microbiology and bacteriology in regards to laboratory techniques for producing plating media.[3]", "2205564": "Lewis Wolpert CBE FRS FRSL FMedSci (19 October 1929 \u2013 28 January 2021) was a South African-born British  developmental biologist, author, and broadcaster. Wolpert popularized his French flag model of embryonic development, using the colours of the  French flag as a visual aid to explain how embryonic cells interpret genetic code for expressing characteristics of living organisms and explaining how signalling between cells early in morphogenesis could inform cells with the same genetic regulatory network of their position and role./nHe wrote several science books, including: Triumph of the Embryo (1991), Malignant Sadness (1999), Six Impossible Things Before Breakfast: the Evolutionary Origins of Belief (2006), and How We Live And Why We Die: The Secret Lives of Cells (2009)./nWolpert was born on 19 October 1929, in Johannesburg[3] to Sarah (n\u00e9e Suzman) and William Wolpert in a South African Jewish family of Lithuanian Jewish origin.[4] His father was a bookshop manager and newsagent.[5] His aunt, Helen Suzman, was a South African anti-apartheid activist and politician.[5]/nHe completed his BSc in civil engineering at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg where he was exposed to progressive politics and communist ideas, and met Nelson Mandela in 1952.[5] He worked as an assistant to the director of Building Research Institute, Pretoria, before going to Israel and working for the Water Planning Board. He went on to study soil mechanics at Imperial College London and later completed his doctorate from King's College London under biophysicist James Danielli.[5]/nWolpert shifted focus from applying his knowledge of soil mechanics to studying the science of dividing cells on the recommendation of a friend in South Africa. Partnering with Trygve Gustafson he worked toward measuring the mechanical forces in cellular division.[5] He served as a lecturer and then a reader in King's College London.[5] He went on to hold the position of Emeritus Professor of Biology as Applied to Medicine in the Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology at University College London until his retirement at 74.[5][6] Wolpert was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2002.[7]/nWolpert was best known for the French flag model of embryonic development, which he put forward in a 1969 paper titled Positional Information and the Spatial Pattern of Cellular Differentiation in the Journal of Theoretical Biology.[8] The model uses the French tricolor flag to visually depict how embryonic cells interpret genetic code to create the same patterns, even when some pieces of the embryo are removed.[9] The model further explains how signalling between cells early in morphogenesis could be used to inform cells with the same genetic regulatory network of their position and role.[8] The model was based on Wolpert's research on sea urchin eggs and provided a framework for research into gastrulation, the embryonic process during which a living organism's body plan is established. Wolpert is credited with the quote: \"It is not birth, marriage, or death, but gastrulation which is truly the most important time in your life.\"[10]/nBiologists recognise Wolpert for elaborating and championing the ideas of positional information and positional value: molecular signals and internal cellular responses to them that enable cells to do the right thing in the right place during embryonic development.[11] The essence of these concepts is that there is a dedicated set of molecules for spatial co-ordination of cells, identical across many species and across different developmental stages and tissues.[11][12] The discovery of Hox gene codes in flies and vertebrates has largely vindicated Wolpert's positional-value concept, while identification of growth-factor morphogens in many species has supported the concept of positional information.[13][14]/nIn a 2005 article entitled \"Spiked\", The Guardian asked a series of scientists \"What is the one thing everyone should learn about science?\" Wolpert responded:/nI would teach the world that science is the best way to understand the world, and that for any set of observations, there is only one correct explanation. Also, science is value-free, as it explains the world as it is. Ethical issues arise only when science is applied to technology \u2013 from medicine to industry.[15]/nOf his book How We Live & Why We Die: The Secret Lives of Cells, Wolpert said the intended audience of his book was the general public. He said he thought the general public needed to understand that people are a society of cells, particularly if they wanted to understand humans.[16] Wolpert also believed that one very important, and so far unsolved, question in cellular research is the origins and evolution of the first cell, as well as the question of cell behaviour, which in his opinion would be useful for the study of illnesses such as cancer or Alzheimer's disease.[16]/nWolpert debated with Christian philosopher William Lane Craig about the existence of God,[17] Christian astrophysicist Hugh Ross on whether there is a case for a creator, and William Dembski on the topic of intelligent design. In a lecture entitled \"Is Science Dangerous?\"[18] he expanded on this, saying: \"I regard it as ethically unacceptable and impractical to censor any aspect of trying to understand the nature of our world.\"[19]/nOn 25 May 1994, Wolpert conducted an hour-long interview with Francis Crick called \"How the Brain 'sees'\" for The Times Dillon Science Forum; Just Results Video Productions produced a video of the interview for The Times. On 15 January 2004, Wolpert and biologist/parapsychologist Rupert Sheldrake engaged in a live debate on the evidence for telepathy, held at the Royal Society of Arts in London.[20] Wolpert disagreed with Sheldrake on the possibility of simulating a cell or an embryo on a computer, which Wolpert believed would be attainable within 20 years. He stated that he believed doing so would predict in detail how the cell will behave, although he also admitted to the difficulty of this task due to the complex networks of proteins, protein-to-protein interactions, and the vast amount of molecules in the cell.[16]/nIn addition to his scientific and research publications, he wrote about his own experience of clinical depression in Malignant Sadness: The Anatomy of Depression (1999). He presented three television programmes based on that book and entitled A Living Hell on BBC2. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1980 and awarded the CBE in 1990. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1999 and one of the first Fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences in 1998. He served as a vice-president of Humanists UK. In 1986 Wolpert was invited to deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on Frankenstein's Quest: Development of Life. In 2018 he received the Royal Medal.[21] Wolpert was chair of the Committee on the Public Understanding of Science between 1994 and 1998. He was the recipient of the Michael Faraday Medal and Prize for science communication from the Royal Society in 2000.[5]/nHe dismissed bioethical concerns about human cloning and embryo research, though he had stated a position against human cloning saying, \"the child would almost certainly be ill or be abnormal\".[16] He was an atheist and took part in public debates about science and religion, though he admitted that some people benefit from religious experiences. He was the vice-president of the British Humanist Association.[5] He was also a lifelong friend of the fellow South African and author Jillian Becker, editor of the Atheist Conservative.[22]/nIn the early 1980s, he began broadcasting on BBC Radio 3 and Radio 4 as a science commentator, with his broadcast conversations with scientists published as A Passion for Science (1988).[5] He went on to write a number of popular science books, including The Unnatural Nature of Science (1994), Six Impossible Things Before Breakfast: The Evolutionary Origins of Belief (2006), Triumph of the Embryo (1991) and How We Live And Why We Die: The Secret Lives of Cells (2009).[23] His book Malignant Sadness (1999) explored his own experiences with clinical depression at the age of 65.[5]/nIn 2011, Wolpert published You're Looking Very Well, a book on the social and scientific aspects of aging. The book was withdrawn from sale by its publisher in 2014 after being found to contain numerous passages copied without attribution from the scientific literature and from various websites, including Wikipedia.[24] Publication of Wolpert's upcoming book, Why Can't a Woman Be More Like a Man?, was also delayed after passages of that book were found to be copied without attribution. Wolpert apologised and took responsibility for the errors with the explanation \"totally inadvertent and due to carelessness\".[24][5]/nWolpert married his first wife Elizabeth Brownstein in 1961 in a marriage that ended in divorce.[5] He later married the Australian writer Jill Neville and they remained married until Neville's death from cancer in 1997.[5] He married Alison Hawkes in 2016 and the couple remained married until his death.

This in turn implies that many organic codes appeared in the history of life after the genetic code, and Barbieri proposed that the greatest novelties of macroevolution were associated with the origin of new codes. These ideas have been developed in the course of a thirty-year period in the books: The Semantic Theory of Evolution (1985),[1] The Organic Codes (2003)[2] and Code Biology (2015).[3]", "61384631": "Pamela A.

Although he struggled with academic politics throughout his career and difficult conditions during World War I and II, his work had lasting influences on the fields of phylogenetics, morphology, and embryology./nNaef was born in Herisau, Switzerland, to parents Martin and Berta. In 1904, he began studying philosophy and literature at the University of Zurich, but soon switched to natural sciences. He graduated in 1908 and went on to pursue a PhD under the guidance of Arnold Lang (1855\u20141914), a former professor of Jena University and close friend of Ernst Haeckel as well as a long-time associate of Anton Dohrn.[1]/nNaef visited Dohrn's Zoological Station in Naples, Italy in 1908. Although initially planning to collect eggs from a variety of animals, he ended up studying the embryology of the squid Loligo vulgaris.[2] He published his dissertation one year later./nIn 1910, Naef accepted a position of a permanent visiting scientist at the Zoological Station, where he began work on a cephalopod monograph that had been started by Giuseppe Jatta. He took a concurrent teaching position at the University of Zurich, working remotely from Naples. During World War I, conditions in Italy deteriorated until finally Naef decided to return to Zurich.[2]/nAfter finding a professorship at the University of Zagreb in 1922, Naef shifted the primary focus of his work to vertebrates.[2] Nevertheless, he returned to the Naples Zoological Station in 1926 to complete his cephalopod monograph, which was published in two parts in the Station's Fauna und Flora des Golfes von Neapel und der Angrenzenden Meers-Abschitte (Fauna e Flora del Golfo di Napoli) series,[3] which formed the basis for his two short but significant monographs on systematic theory./nIn 1927 Naef became Professor of Zoology at the University of Cairo, and in 1929 Director of the Zoological Department. He expected this position to be a temporary one until he could find a job at a European university. In fact, in 1931 Naef was nearly hired as chair of zoology at the University of Basle, but the position was given to Adolf Portmann instead.[1] Naef remained at Cairo for the rest of his career. He planned a comprehensive Textbook of Vertebrate Zoology, but his work on the project was stifled by isolating governmental regulations during World War II.[2]/nAfter the war, Naef attempted to continue with his publications. Soon, however, he developed pancreatic cancer. He returned to Zurich in 1949 and died on May 11; few obituaries were published.[1]/nNaef was married three times: first, to Elisabeth Rosenbaum on March 30, 1907. Their daughter Gerda was born on December 25 of the same year. In 1909, Elisabeth began studying medicine at the University of Zurich; she and Naef divorced in 1910. Naef's second marriage, begun soon afterward, also ended in divorce, in 1915. In 1917 he met his third wife, Maria Bendiner, and although they would not marry until 1924, this marriage lasted until Naef's death. The couple had two daughters.[1][2]/nAlong with his mentors and peers, Naef readily accepted Darwin's theory of descent with modification, and embraced the challenge of understanding evolutionary relationships among organisms. He argued that direct morphological observations form the necessary basis for systematics.[4] Naef described his approach as Systematische Morphologie, the details of which he sketched out as early as 1913:/n\"Phylogenetic and natural systematics deal with the same factual material, and although each has different basic concepts, both disciplines can be united in a single concept because their objects are so similar. I have therefore proposed the name 'systematic morphology' for this concept[5] ... It is intended to show that there is an inner relationship between natural systematics and (comparative) morphology.\u201d[3]/nNaef's concern was with the discovery of natural, as opposed to artificial, classification, a problem examined in detail by A. P. de Candolle.[6] Naef expressed it so:/n\"For decades, phylogenetics lacked a valid methodological basis and developed on the decayed trunk of a withering tradition rooted in the idealistic morphology and the systematics of pre-Darwinian times. There was talk of systematic 'tact' and morphological 'instinct', terms which were felt rather than understood and consequently insufficient to form the frame of a science which required sound definitions and clearly formulated principles.\"[3]/nAnd thus was born Systematische Morphologie, perhaps the beginnings of cladistics, in its most general form. Towards the end of his career, Naef published several detailed accounts of Systematische Morphologie,[7][8] including a succinct summary in the widely read 2nd edition of the Handw\u00f6rterbuch der Naturwissenschaften.[9] This work strongly influenced Willi Hennig, who developed a similar philosophy but disagreed with Naef on the primacy of direct observation in favor of pursuing the metaphysical \"true nature\" of phylogenetics.[4]/nIt was Naef's abiding fascination with evolution and systematics that brought him to the study of cephalopods. Invited by Dohrn to complete a cephalopod monograph, he took this project as an opportunity to put his own systematic theories into practice./nHe aimed to construct the first complete phylogeny for any single group, a purpose that cephalopods served well. This group contains relatively few species (compared to, say, gastropods) spanning relatively high morphological diversity\u2014ideal material for the systematist. Naef also found that cephalopod embryology and paleontology were quite amenable to study.[3]/nAlthough Naef professed no \"special interest\" in cephalopods,[3] his work significantly advanced scientific knowledge of the group and he maintained a connection to cephalopod studies throughout his career.[2] He described dozens of new species, genera and families\u2014both living and fossil\u2014and created the first chart of cephalopod embryonic stages, which is still in use today./nNaef's hypotheses about cephalopod evolution continue to inform contemporary research. He found evidence for fins on belemnites almost a hundred years before their existence was finally proven,[10] and he was the first to propose that modern squids evolved directly from belemnites. After a period of skepticism, this idea has recently been gathering traction.[11] Naef's suggestion that argonauts could have evolved from ammonoids, however, has been refuted.[12]/nIn 1930, the extinct spirulid genus Naefia was named in his honor by paleontologist Walter Wetzel.[13]", "8103901": "Roxana Moslehi (Persian: \u0631\u06a9\u0633\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0645\u0635\u0644\u062d\u06cc) is an Iranian-born genetic epidemiologist./nMost of her research is on cancer and cancer precursors, including work on radiation-induced cancer of the eyes,[1] genetic and environmental causes of ovarian cancer, and ethnic differences in breast cancer incidence.[2] She also conducts molecular epidemiologic and genomic studies of other diseases such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and gestational complications.

He chaired the department from 1959 to 1969 and again from 1975 to 1976. He supervised the doctoral dissertations of about 70 graduate students, 10 of whom eventually chaired their own microbiology departments.[3]/nDuring his employment by the Wallace & Tiernan Company, he was instrumental in the development of Desenex.[4][5] He did research on bacterial nitrogen fixation and the physiology and genetics of bacteria.[2] From 1962 to 1963 he worked at McMurdo Station as a biologist for the United States Antarctic Research Program.[6]/nWyss was elected in 1953 a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.[7]  In 1967 the United States Board of Geographic Names named Mount Wyss in his honor.[8] He was a Fulbright fellow in 1971 in Australia and in 1978 in Nepal.[9]/nIn 1941 he married Margaret Bess Bedell. They had three daughters.[citation needed]", "44279846": "Indira Chakravarty is an Indian public health specialist, scholar, environmentalist,[1] and 2014 recipient of the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award by the Government of India, for her contributions to the fields of public health and environment.[2]/nMicronutrient deficiency is a serious public health concern in most developing countries.

His reign of over 62 years is the longest of any historical Japanese emperor and one of the longest-reigning monarchs in the world./nHe was the head of state under the Meiji Constitution during Japan's imperial expansion, militarization, and involvement in World War II. Under Hirohito, Japan waged a war across Asia in the 1930s and 1940s./nAfter Japan's surrender, despite Japan waging the war in the name of Hirohito, he was not prosecuted for war crimes, for General Douglas MacArthur thought that an ostensibly cooperative emperor would help establish a peaceful Allied occupation and would help the U.S. achieve its postwar objectives.[1] On 1 January 1946, under pressure from the Allies, the Emperor formally renounced his divinity./nHirohito and his wife, Nagako, had two sons and five daughters; he was succeeded by his fifth child and eldest son, Akihito. By 1979, Hirohito was the only monarch in the world with the title \"Emperor\"./nHirohito was born at Aoyama Palace in Tokyo (during the reign of his grandfather, Emperor Meiji) on 29 April 1901,[2] the first son of 21-year-old Crown prince Yoshihito (the future Emperor Taish\u014d) and 16-year-old Crown Princess Sadako (the future Empress Teimei).[3] He was the grandson of Emperor Meiji and Yanagiwara Naruko. His childhood title was Prince Michi./nTen weeks after he was born, Hirohito was removed from the court and placed in the care of Count Kawamura Sumiyoshi, who raised him as his grandchild. At the age of 3, Hirohito and his brother Yasuhito were returned to court when Kawamura died\u00a0\u2013 first to the imperial mansion in Numazu, Shizuoka, then back to the Aoyama Palace.[4]/nIn 1908, he began elementary studies at the Gakush\u016bin (Peers School).[5] Emperor Mutsuhito, then appointed General Nogi Maresuke to be the Gakush\u016bin's tenth president as well as the one in-charge on educating his grandson. The main aspect that they focused was on physical education and health, primarily because Hirohito was a sickly child, on par with the impartment or inculcation of values such as frugality, patience, manliness, self-control, and devotion to the duty at hand.[6]/nDuring 1912, at the age of 11, Hirohito was commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Army as a Second Lieutenant and in the Imperial Japanese Navy as an Ensign. He was also bestowed with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Chrysanthemum.[7] When his grandfather, Emperor Meiji died on 30 July 1912, Yoshihito assumed the throne and his eldest son, Hirohito became heir apparent./nAfter learning about the death of his instructor, General Nogi, he along with his brothers were reportedly overcome with emotions. He would later acknowledge the lasting influence of Nogi in his life. At that time he was still two years away from completing primary school, henceforth his education was compensated by Fleet Admiral Togo Heihachiro and Naval Captain Ogasawara Naganari, wherein later on, would become his major opponents with regards to his national defense policy.[8]/nShiratori Kurakichi, one of his middle-school instructors, was one of the personalities who deeply influenced the life of Hirohito. Kurakichi was a trained historian from Germany, imbibing the positivist historiographic trend by Leopold von Ranke. He was the one who inculcated in the mind of the young Hirohito that there is a connection between the divine origin of the imperial line and the aspiration of linking it to the myth of the racial superiority and homogeneity of the Japanese. The emperors were often a driving force in the modernization of their country. He taught Hirohito that the Empire of Japan was created and governed through diplomatic actions (taking into accounts the interests of other nations benevolently and justly).[9]/nOn 2 November 1916, Hirohito was formally proclaimed crown prince and heir apparent. An investiture ceremony was not required to confirm this status.[10]/nFrom 3 March to 3 September 1921 (Taisho 10), the Crown Prince made official visits to the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and Vatican City. This was the first visit to Western Europe by the Crown Prince.[c] Despite strong opposition in Japan, this was realized by the efforts of elder Japanese statesmen (Genr\u014d) such as Yamagata Aritomo and Saionji Kinmochi./nThe departure of Prince Hirohito was widely reported in newspapers. The Japanese battleship Katori was used, and departed from Yokohama, sailed to Naha, Hong Kong, Singapore, Colombo, Suez, Cairo, and Gibraltar. It arrived in Portsmouth two months later on 9 May, and on the same day they reached the British capital London. He was welcomed in the UK as a partner of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and met with King George V and Prime Minister David Lloyd George. That evening, a banquet was held at Buckingham Palace and a meeting with George V and Prince Arthur of Connaught. George V said that he treated his father like Hirohito, who was nervous in an unfamiliar foreign country, and that relieved his tension. The next day, he met Prince Edward (the future Edward VIII) at Windsor Castle, and a banquet was held every day thereafter. In London, he toured the British Museum, the Tower of London, the Bank of England, Lloyd's Marine Insurance, Oxford University, Army University, and the Naval War College. He also enjoyed theater at the New Oxford Theatre and the Delhi Theatre.[11] At Cambridge University, he listened to Professor J. R. Tanner's lecture on \"Relationship between the British Royal Family and its People\" and was awarded an honorary doctorate degree.[12][13] He visited Edinburgh, Scotland, from 19 to 20 May, and was also awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws at the University of Edinburgh. He stayed at the residence of John Stewart-Murray, 8th Duke of Atholl, for three days. On his stay with Stuart-Murray, the prince was quoted as saying, \"The rise of Bolsheviks won't happen if you live a simple life like Duke Athol.\"[12]/nIn Italy, he met with King Vittorio Emanuele III and others, attended official international banquets, and visited places such as the fierce battlefields of World War I./nAfter returning to Japan, Hirohito became Regent of Japan (Sessh\u014d) on 25 November 1921, in place of his ailing father, who was affected by mental illness.[14][15]  In 1923 he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the army and Commander in the navy, and army Colonel and Navy Captain in 1925./nDuring Hirohito's regency, many important events occurred:/nIn the Four-Power Treaty on Insular Possessions signed on 13 December 1921, Japan, the United States, Britain, and France agreed to recognize the status quo in the Pacific. Japan and Britain agreed to end the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. The Washington Naval Treaty limiting warship numbers was signed on 6 February 1922. Japan withdrew troops from the Siberian Intervention on 28 August 1922. The Great Kant\u014d earthquake devastated Tokyo on 1 September 1923. On 27 December 1923, Daisuke Namba attempted to assassinate Hirohito in the Toranomon Incident, but his attempt failed.[16] During interrogation, he claimed to be a communist and was executed.[17]/nPrince Hirohito married his distant cousin Princess Nagako Kuni, the eldest daughter of Prince Kuniyoshi Kuni, on 26 January 1924. They had two sons and five daughters[18] (see Issue)./nThe daughters who lived to adulthood left the imperial family as a result of the American reforms of the Japanese imperial household in October 1947 (in the case of Princess Shigeko) or under the terms of the Imperial Household Law at the moment of their subsequent marriages (in the cases of Princesses Kazuko, Atsuko, and Takako)./nOn 25 December 1926, Yoshihito died and Hirohito became emperor. The Crown Prince was said to have received the succession (senso).[19] The Taish\u014d era's end and the Sh\u014dwa era's beginning (Enlightened Peace) were proclaimed. The deceased Emperor was posthumously renamed Emperor Taish\u014d within days. Following Japanese custom, the new Emperor was never referred to by his given name but rather was referred to simply as \"His Majesty the Emperor\" which may be shortened to \"His Majesty.\" In writing, the Emperor was also referred to formally as \"The Reigning Emperor.\"/nIn November 1928, Hirohito's accession was confirmed in ceremonies (sokui)[19] which are conventionally identified as \"enthronement\" and \"coronation\" (Sh\u014dwa no tairei-shiki); but this formal event would have been more accurately described as a public confirmation that he possessed the Japanese Imperial Regalia,[20] also called the Three Sacred Treasures, which have been handed down through the centuries.[21] However his enthronment were planned and staged under the economic conditions of a recession whereas the 55th Imperial Diet unanimously passed $7,360,000 for the festivities.[22]/nThe first part of Hirohito's reign took place against a background of financial crisis and increasing military power within the government through both legal and extralegal means. The Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy held veto power over the formation of cabinets since 1900. Between 1921 and 1944, there were 64 separate incidents of political violence./nHirohito narrowly escaped assassination by a hand grenade thrown by a Korean independence activist, Lee Bong-chang, in Tokyo on 9 January 1932, in the Sakuradamon Incident./nAnother notable case was the assassination of moderate Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi in 1932, marking the end of civilian control of the military. The February 26 incident, an attempted military coup, followed in February 1936. It was carried out by junior Army officers of the K\u014dd\u014dha faction who had the sympathy of many high-ranking officers including Yasuhito, Prince Chichibu, one of Hirohito's brothers. This revolt was occasioned by a loss of political support by the militarist faction in Diet elections. The coup resulted in the murders of several high government and Army officials./nWhen Chief Aide-de-camp Shigeru Honj\u014d informed him of the revolt, Hirohito immediately ordered that it be put down and referred to the officers as \"rebels\" (b\u014dto). Shortly thereafter, he ordered Army Minister Yoshiyuki Kawashima to suppress the rebellion within the hour. He asked for reports from Honj\u014d every 30 minutes. The next day, when told by Honj\u014d that the high command had made little progress in quashing the rebels, the Emperor told him \"I Myself, will lead the Konoe Division and subdue them.\" The rebellion was suppressed following his orders on 29 February.[23]/nBeginning from the Mukden Incident in 1931 in which Japan staged a False flag operation and made a false accusation against Chinese dissidents as a pretext to invade Manchuria, Japan occupied Chinese territories and established puppet governments. Such aggression was recommended to Hirohito by his chiefs of staff and prime minister Fumimaro Konoe, and Hirohito did not voice objection to the invasion of China.[24][page\u00a0needed][25][1]/nA diary by chamberlain Kuraji Ogura says that he was reluctant to start war against China in 1937 because they had underestimated China's military strength and Japan should be cautious in its strategy. In this regard, Ogura writes Hirohito said that \"once you start (a war), it cannot easily be stopped in the middle ... What's important is when to end the war\" and \"one should be cautious in starting a war, but once begun, it should be carried out thoroughly.\"[26]/nNonetheless, according to Herbert Bix, Hirohito's main concern seems to have been the possibility of an attack by the Soviet Union given his questions to his chief of staff, Prince Kan'in Kotohito, and army minister, Hajime Sugiyama, about the time it could take to crush Chinese resistance and how could they prepare for the eventuality of a Soviet incursion. Based on Bix's findings, Hirohito was displeased by Prince Kan'in's evasive responses about the substance of such contingency plans but nevertheless still approved the decision to move troops to North China.[27]/nAccording to Akira Fujiwara, Hirohito endorsed the policy of qualifying the invasion of China as an \"incident\" instead of a \"war\"; therefore, he did not issue any notice to observe international law in this conflict (unlike what his predecessors did in previous conflicts officially recognized by Japan as wars), and the Deputy Minister of the Japanese Army instructed the chief of staff of Japanese China Garrison Army on 5 August not to use the term \"prisoners of war\" for Chinese captives. This instruction led to the removal of the constraints of international law on the treatment of Chinese prisoners.[28] The works of Yoshiaki Yoshimi and Seiya Matsuno show that Hirohito also authorized, by specific orders (rinsanmei), the use of chemical weapons against the Chinese.[29]/nLater in his life, Hirohito looked back on his decision to give the go-ahead to wage a 'defensive' war against China and opined that his foremost priority was not to wage war with China but to prepare for a war with the Soviet Union, as his army had reassured him that the China war would end within three months, but that decision of his had haunted him since he forgot that the Japanese forces in China were drastically fewer than that of the Chinese, hence the shortsightedness of his perspective was evident.[30]/nOn December 1, 1937, Hirohito had given formal instruction to General Iwane Matsui to capture and occupy the enemy capital of Nanking. He was very eager to fight this battle since he and his council firmly believed that all it would take is a one huge blow that to bring forth the surrender of Chiang Kai-Shek.[31] He even gave an Imperial Rescript to Iwane when he returned to Tokyo a year later, despite the brutality that his officers had inflicted on the Chinese populace in Nanking, hence Hirohito had seemingly turned a blind eye to and condoned these monstrosities./nDuring the invasion of Wuhan, from August to October 1938, Hirohito authorized the use of toxic gas on 375 separate occasions,[32] despite the resolution adopted by the League of Nations on 14 May condemning Japanese use of toxic gas./nIn July 1939, Hirohito quarrelled with his brother, Prince Chichibu, over whether to support the Anti-Comintern Pact, and reprimanded the army minister, Seishir\u014d Itagaki.[33] But after the success of the Wehrmacht in Europe, Hirohito consented to the alliance. On 27 September 1940, ostensibly under Hirohito's leadership, Japan became a contracting partner of the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy forming the Axis powers./nThe objectives to be obtained were clearly defined: a free hand to continue with the conquest of China and Southeast Asia, no increase in US or British military forces in the region, and cooperation by the West \"in the acquisition of goods needed by our Empire.\"[34]/nOn 5 September, Prime Minister Konoe informally submitted a draft of the decision to Hirohito, just one day in advance of the Imperial Conference at which it would be formally implemented. On this evening, Hirohito had a meeting with the chief of staff of the army, Sugiyama, chief of staff of the navy, Osami Nagano, and Prime Minister Konoe. Hirohito questioned Sugiyama about the chances of success of an open war with the Occident. As Sugiyama answered positively, Hirohito scolded him:/n\u2014At the time of the China Incident, the army told me that we could achieve peace immediately after dealing them one blow with three divisions ... but you can't still beat Chiang Kai-shek even today! Sugiyama, you were army minister at that time.\u2014China is a vast area with many ways in and ways out, and we met unexpectedly big difficulties ...\u2014You say the interior of China is huge; isn't the Pacific Ocean even bigger than China? ... Didn't I caution you each time about those matters? Sugiyama, are you lying to me?[35]/nChief of Naval General Staff Admiral Nagano, a former Navy Minister and vastly experienced, later told a trusted colleague, \"I have never seen the Emperor reprimand us in such a manner, his face turning red and raising his voice.\"[36][37]/nNevertheless, all speakers at the Imperial Conference were united in favor of war rather than diplomacy.[38] Baron Yoshimichi Hara, President of the Imperial Council and Hirohito's representative, then questioned them closely, producing replies to the effect that war would be considered only as a last resort from some, and silence from others./nOn 8 October, Sugiyama signed a 47-page report to the Emperor (s\u014dj\u014dan) outlining in minute detail plans for the advance into Southeast Asia. During the third week of October, Sugiyama gave Hirohito a 51-page document, \"Materials in Reply to the Throne,\" about the operational outlook for the war.[39]/nAs war preparations continued, Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe found himself increasingly isolated, and he resigned on 16 October. He justified himself to his chief cabinet secretary, Kenji Tomita, by stating:/nOf course His Majesty is a pacifist, and there is no doubt he wished to avoid war. When I told him that to initiate war was a mistake, he agreed. But the next day, he would tell me: \"You were worried about it yesterday, but you do not have to worry so much.\" Thus, gradually, he began to lean toward war. And the next time I met him, he leaned even more toward. In short, I felt the Emperor was telling me: my prime minister does not understand military matters, I know much more. In short, the Emperor had absorbed the view of the army and navy high commands.[40]/nThe army and the navy recommended the appointment of Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni, one of Hirohito's uncles, as prime minister. According to the Sh\u014dwa \"Monologue\", written after the war, Hirohito then said that if the war were to begin while a member of the imperial house was prime minister, the imperial house would have to carry the responsibility and he was opposed to this.[41]/nInstead, Hirohito chose the hard-line General Hideki T\u014dj\u014d, who was known for his devotion to the imperial institution, and asked him to make a policy review of what had been sanctioned by the Imperial Conferences. On 2 November T\u014dj\u014d, Sugiyama, and Nagano reported to Hirohito that the review of eleven points had been in vain. Emperor Hirohito gave his consent to the war and then asked: \"Are you going to provide justification for the war?\"[42][43] The decision for war against the United States was presented for approval to Hirohito by General T\u014dj\u014d, Naval Minister Admiral Shigetar\u014d Shimada, and Japanese Foreign Minister Shigenori T\u014dg\u014d.[44]/nOn 3 November, Nagano explained in detail the plan of the attack on Pearl Harbor to Hirohito.[45] On 5 November Emperor Hirohito approved in imperial conference the operations plan for a war against the Occident and had many meetings with the military and T\u014dj\u014d until the end of the month.[46] On 25 November Henry L. Stimson, United States Secretary of War, noted in his diary that he had discussed with US President Franklin D. Roosevelt the severe likelihood that Japan was about to launch a surprise attack and that the question had been \"how we should maneuver them [the Japanese] into the position of firing the first shot without allowing too much danger to ourselves.\"/nOn the following day, 26 November 1941, US Secretary of State Cordell Hull presented the Japanese ambassador with the Hull note, which as one of its conditions demanded the complete withdrawal of all Japanese troops from French Indochina and China. Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo said to his cabinet, \"This is an ultimatum.\" On 1 December an Imperial Conference sanctioned the \"War against the United States, United Kingdom and the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\"[47]/nOn 8 December (7 December in Hawaii), 1941, in simultaneous attacks, Japanese forces struck at the Hong Kong Garrison, the US Fleet in Pearl Harbor and in the Philippines, and began the invasion of Malaya./nWith the nation fully committed to the war, Hirohito took a keen interest in military progress and sought to boost morale. According to Akira Yamada and Akira Fujiwara, Hirohito made major interventions in some military operations. For example, he pressed Sugiyama four times, on 13 and 21 January and 9 and 26 February, to increase troop strength and launch an attack on Bataan. On 9 February 19 March, and 29 May, Hirohito ordered the Army Chief of staff to examine the possibilities for an attack on Chongqing in China, which led to Operation Gogo.[48]/nWhile some authors, like journalists Peter Jennings and Todd Brewster, say that throughout the war, Hirohito was \"outraged\" at Japanese war crimes and the political dysfunction of many societal institutions that proclaimed their loyalty to him, and sometimes spoke up against them,[49] others, such as historians Herbert P. Bix and Mark Felton, as well as the expert on China\u2019s international relations Michael Tai, point out that Hirohito personally sanctioned the \"Three Alls policy\" (Sank\u014d Sakusen), a scorched earth strategy implemented in China from 1942 to 1945 and which was both directly and indirectly responsible for the deaths of \"more than 2.7 million\" Chinese civilians.[50][51][52]/nAs the tide of war began to turn against Japan (around late 1942 and early 1943), the flow of information to the palace gradually began to bear less and less relation to reality, while others suggest that Hirohito worked closely with Prime Minister Hideki Tojo, continued to be well and accurately briefed by the military, and knew Japan's military position precisely right up to the point of surrender. The chief of staff of the General Affairs section of the Prime Minister's office, Shuichi Inada, remarked to T\u014dj\u014d's private secretary, Sadao Akamatsu:/nThere has never been a cabinet in which the prime minister, and all the ministers, reported so often to the throne. In order to effect the essence of genuine direct imperial rule and to relieve the concerns of the Emperor, the ministers reported to the throne matters within the scope of their responsibilities as per the prime minister's directives\u00a0... In times of intense activities, typed drafts were presented to the Emperor with corrections in red. First draft, second draft, final draft and so forth, came as deliberations progressed one after the other and were sanctioned accordingly by the Emperor.[53]/nIn the first six months of war, all the major engagements had been victories. Japanese advances were stopped in the summer of 1942 with the battle of Midway and the landing of the American forces on Guadalcanal and Tulagi in August. Hirohito played an increasingly influential role in the war; in eleven major episodes he was deeply involved in supervising the actual conduct of war operations. Hirohito pressured the High Command to order an early attack on the Philippines in 1941\u201342, including the fortified Bataan peninsula. He secured the deployment of army air power in the Guadalcanal campaign. Following Japan's withdrawal from Guadalcanal he demanded a new offensive in New Guinea, which was duly carried out but failed badly. Unhappy with the navy's conduct of the war, he criticized its withdrawal from the central Solomon Islands and demanded naval battles against the Americans for the losses they had inflicted in the Aleutians. The battles were disasters. Finally, it was at his insistence that plans were drafted for the recapture of Saipan and, later, for an offensive in the Battle of Okinawa.[54]  With the Army and Navy bitterly feuding, he settled disputes over the allocation of resources. He helped plan military offenses.[55]/nOn September of 1944, Hirohito declared that it must be his citizens' resolve to smash the evil purposes of the Westerners so that their imperial destiny might continue, but all along, it is just a mask for the urgent need of Japan to scratch a victory against the counter-offensive campaign of the Allied Forces.[56]/nOn October 18, 1944, the Imperial headquarters had resolved that the Japanese must make a stand in the vicinity of Leyte to prevent the Americans from landing in the Philippines. This view was widely frowned upon and disgruntled the policymakers from both the army and navy sectors. Hirohito was quoted that he approved of such since if they won in that campaign, they would be finally having a room to negotiate with the Americans. As high as their spirits could go, the reality check for the Japanese would also come into play since the forces they have sent in Leyte, was practically the ones that would efficiently defend the island of Luzon, hence the Japanese had struck a huge blow in their own military planning.[57]/nThe media, under tight government control, repeatedly portrayed him as lifting the popular morale even as the Japanese cities came under heavy air attack in 1944\u201345 and food and housing shortages mounted.  Japanese retreats and defeats were celebrated by the media as successes that portended \"Certain Victory.\"[58] Only gradually did it become apparent to the Japanese people that the situation was very grim due to growing shortages of food, medicine, and fuel as U.S submarines began wiping out Japanese shipping. Starting in mid 1944, American raids on the major cities of Japan made a mockery of the unending tales of victory. Later that year, with the downfall of Tojo's government, two other prime ministers were appointed to continue the war effort, Kuniaki Koiso and Kantar\u014d Suzuki\u2014each with the formal approval of Hirohito. Both were unsuccessful and Japan was nearing disaster.[59]/nIn early 1945, in the wake of the losses in the Battle of Leyte, Emperor Hirohito began a series of individual meetings with senior government officials to consider the progress of the war. All but ex-Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe advised continuing the war. Konoe feared a communist revolution even more than defeat in war and urged a negotiated surrender. In February 1945, during the first private audience with Hirohito he had been allowed in three years,[60][incomplete short citation] Konoe advised Hirohito to begin negotiations to end the war. According to Grand Chamberlain Hisanori Fujita, Hirohito, still looking for a tennozan (a great victory) in order to provide a stronger bargaining position, firmly rejected Konoe's recommendation.[61][incomplete short citation]/nWith each passing week victory became less likely. In April, the Soviet Union issued notice that it would not renew its neutrality agreement. Japan's ally Germany surrendered in early May 1945. In June, the cabinet reassessed the war strategy, only to decide more firmly than ever on a fight to the last man. This strategy was officially affirmed at a brief Imperial Council meeting, at which, as was normal, Hirohito did not speak./nThe following day, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal K\u014dichi Kido prepared a draft document which summarized the hopeless military situation and proposed a negotiated settlement. Extremists in Japan were also calling for a death-before-dishonor mass suicide, modeled on the \"47 Ronin\" incident. By mid-June 1945, the cabinet had agreed to approach the Soviet Union to act as a mediator for a negotiated surrender but not before Japan's bargaining position had been improved by repulse of the anticipated Allied invasion of mainland Japan./nOn 22 June, Hirohito met with his ministers saying, \"I desire that concrete plans to end the war, unhampered by existing policy, be speedily studied and that efforts be made to implement them.\" The attempt to negotiate a peace via the Soviet Union came to nothing. There was always the threat that extremists would carry out a coup or foment other violence. On 26 July 1945, the Allies issued the Potsdam Declaration demanding unconditional surrender. The Japanese government council, the Big Six, considered that option and recommended to Hirohito that it be accepted only if one to four conditions were agreed upon, including a guarantee of Hirohito's continued position in Japanese society. Hirohito decided not to surrender./nThat changed after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Soviet declaration of war. On 9 August, Emperor Hirohito told K\u014dichi Kido: \"The Soviet Union has declared war and today began hostilities against us.\"[62] On 10 August, the cabinet drafted an \"Imperial Rescript ending the War\" following Hirohito's indications that the declaration did not compromise any demand which prejudiced his prerogatives as a sovereign ruler./nOn 12 August 1945, Hirohito informed the imperial family of his decision to surrender. One of his uncles, Prince Yasuhiko Asaka, asked whether the war would be continued if the kokutai (national polity) could not be preserved. Hirohito simply replied \"Of course.\"[63] On 14 August, Hirohito made the decision to surrender \"unconditionally\"[64] and the Suzuki government notified the Allies that it had accepted the Potsdam Declaration./nOn 15 August, a recording of Hirohito's surrender speech was broadcast over the radio (the first time Hirohito was heard on the radio by the Japanese people) announcing Japan's acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration. During the historic broadcast Hirohito stated: \"Moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is, indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should we continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.\" The speech also noted that \"the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage\" and ordered the Japanese to \"endure the unendurable.\" The speech, using formal, archaic Japanese, was not readily understood by many commoners. According to historian Richard Storry in A History of Modern Japan, Hirohito typically used \"a form of language familiar only to the well-educated\" and to the more traditional samurai families.[65]/nA faction of the army opposed to the surrender attempted a coup d'\u00e9tat on the evening of 14 August, prior to the broadcast. They seized the Imperial Palace (the Ky\u016bj\u014d incident), but the physical recording of Hirohito's speech was hidden and preserved overnight. The coup failed, and the speech was broadcast the next morning.[66]/nIn his first ever press conference given in Tokyo in 1975, when he was asked what he thought of the bombing of Hiroshima, Hirohito answered: \"It's very regrettable that nuclear bombs were dropped and I feel sorry for the citizens of Hiroshima but it couldn't be helped because that happened in wartime\" (shikata ga nai, meaning \"it cannot be helped\").[67][incomplete short citation][68]/nAfter the Japanese surrender in August 1945, there was a large amount of pressure that came from both Allied countries and Japanese leftists that demanded Hirohito step down and be indicted as a war criminal.[69] The Australian government listed Hirohito as a war criminal, and intended to put him on trial.[70] General Douglas MacArthur did not like the idea, as he thought that an ostensibly cooperating emperor would help establish a peaceful allied occupation regime in Japan.[71][72] As a result, any possible evidence that would incriminate Hirohito and his family were excluded from the International Military Tribunal for the Far East.[71] MacArthur created a plan that separated Hirohito from the militarists, retained Hirohito as a constitutional monarch but only as a figurehead, and used Hirohito to retain control over Japan and help achieve American postwar objectives in Japan.[72]/nThe issue of Emperor Hirohito's war responsibility is contested.[73] During the war, the Allies frequently depicted Hirohito to equate with Hitler and Mussolini as the three Axis dictators.[74] After the war, since the U.S. thought that the retention of the emperor would help establish a peaceful allied occupation regime in Japan, and help the U.S. achieve their postwar objectives, they depicted Hirohito as a \"powerless figurehead\" without any implication in wartime policies.[72] Historians have said that Hirohito wielded more power than previously believed,[74][75][76] and he was actively involved in the decision to launch the war as well as in other political and military decisions.[77] Over the years, as new evidence surfaced, historians were able to arrive at the conclusion that he was culpable for the war, and was reflecting on his wartime role.[1]/nHistorians have stated that Hirohito was directly responsible for the atrocities committed by the imperial forces in the Second Sino-Japanese War and in World War II. They have said that he and some members of the imperial family, such as his brother Prince Chichibu, his cousins the princes Takeda and Fushimi, and his uncles the princes Kan'in, Asaka, and Higashikuni, should have been tried for war crimes.[78][page\u00a0needed][79][incomplete short citation] In a study published in 1996, historian Mitsuyoshi Himeta said that the Three Alls policy (Sank\u014d Sakusen), a Japanese scorched earth policy adopted in China and sanctioned by Emperor Hirohito himself, was both directly and indirectly responsible for the deaths of \"more than 2.7 million\" Chinese civilians. His works and those of Akira Fujiwara about the details of the operation were commented by Herbert P. Bix in his Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan, who wrote that the Sank\u014d Sakusen far surpassed Nanking Massacre not only in terms of numbers, but in brutality as well as \"These military operations caused death and suffering on a scale incomparably greater than the totally unplanned orgy of killing in Nanking, which later came to symbolize the war\".[80] While the Nanking Massacre was unplanned, Bix said \"Hirohito knew of and approved annihilation campaigns in China that included burning villages thought to harbor guerrillas.\"[81] Top U.S. government officials understood the emperor's intimate role during the war.[82]/nPoison gas weapons, such as phosgene, were produced by Unit 731 and authorized by specific orders given by Hirohito himself, transmitted by the chief of staff of the army. Hirohito authorized the use of toxic gas 375 times during the Battle of Wuhan from August to October 1938.[73]/nOfficially, the imperial constitution, adopted under Emperor Meiji, gave full power to the Emperor. Article 4 prescribed that, \"The Emperor is the head of the Empire, combining in Himself the rights of sovereignty, and exercises them, according to the provisions of the present Constitution.\" Likewise, according to article 6, \"The Emperor gives sanction to laws and orders them to be promulgated and executed,\" and article 11, \"The Emperor has the supreme command of the Army and the Navy.\" The Emperor was thus the leader of the Imperial General Headquarters.[83]/nAccording to Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi of York University, Hirohito's authority up to 1945 depended on three elements:/nFirst, he was a constitutional monarch subject to legal restrictions and binding conventions, as he has so often stressed. Second, he was supreme commander of Japanese armed forces, though his orders were often ignored and sometimes defied. Third, he wielded absolute moral authority in Japan by granting imperial honors that conveyed incontestable prestige and by issuing imperial rescripts that had coercive power greater than law.[84]/nThe last two elements of Hirohito's power were the strongest, while the first element was the weakest.[85] Hirohito had the ultimate authority to shape the country's policies by either agreeing or disagreeing with it.[86] He even used his authority to disagree with policies shaped by the army.[85] Hirohito was the supreme military commander in Imperial Japan, and pursued armed expansionist policies against weaker Asian neighbors.[85] He never opposed war or expansion, but he opposed war with the US and Britain because of his fear that Japan would lose.[86]/nWakabayashi further adds:/nAlso as a matter of course, he wanted to keep what his generals conquered -- though he was less greedy than some of them. None of this should surprise us. Hirohito would be no more have granted independence Korea independence or returned Manchuria to China than Roosevelt would have granted Hawaii independence or returned Texas to Mexico.[86]/nIn December 1990, the Bungeishunj\u016b published the Showa tenno dokuhaku roku (Dokuhaku roku), which recorded conversations Hirohito held with five Imperial Household Ministry officials between March and April 1946, containing twenty-four sections.[87]The Dokuhaku roku recorded Hirohito speaking retroactively on topics arranged chronologically from 1919 to 1946, right before the Tokyo War Crimes Trials.[87]/nIn December 1941, Japan signed an agreement that forbade Japan from signing a separate peace treaty with the United States.[88] In the Dokuhaku roku, Hirohito said:/n(In 1941,) we thought we could achieve a draw with the US, or at best win by a six to four margin; but total victory was nearly impossible ... When the war actually began, however, we gained a miraculous victory at Pearl Harbor and our invasions of Malaya and Burma succeeded far quicker than expected. So, if not for this (agreement), we might have achieved peace when we were in an advantageous position.[88]/nAccording to Wakabayashi, this entry in the Dokuhaku roku explains why Hirohito wanted an early end to the war, and disproves the claim that Hirohito wanted an early end to the war because he desired peace.[88]/nIn September 1944, Prime Minister Koiso Kuniaki proposed that concessions, such as the return of Hong Kong, and a settlement should be given to Chiang Kai Shek, so that Japanese troops in China could be diverted to the Pacific War.[89] Hirohito rejected the proposal and did not want to give concessions to China because he feared it would signal Japanese weakness, create defeatism at home, and trigger independence movements in occupied countries.[90] In August 1945, Hirohito agreed to the Potsdam Declaration because he thought that the American occupation of Japan would uphold imperial rule in Japan.[87]/nHistorians such as Herbert Bix, Akira Fujiwara, Peter Wetzler, and Akira Yamada assert that post-war arguments favoring the view that Hirohito was a mere figurehead overlook the importance of numerous \"behind the chrysanthemum curtain\" meetings where the real decisions were made between the Emperor, his chiefs of staff, and the cabinet. Using primary sources and the monumental work of Shir\u014d Hara as a basis,[d] Fujiwara[91] and Wetzler[92] have produced evidence suggesting that the Emperor worked through intermediaries to exercise a great deal of control over the military and was neither bellicose nor a pacifist but an opportunist who governed in a pluralistic decision-making process. American historian Herbert P. Bix said that Emperor Hirohito might have been the prime mover behind most of Japan's military aggression during the Sh\u014dwa era.[79][page\u00a0needed]/nThe view promoted by the Imperial Palace and American occupation forces immediately after World War II portrayed Emperor Hirohito as a purely ceremonial figure who behaved strictly according to protocol while remaining at a distance from the decision-making processes. This view was endorsed by Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita in a speech on the day of Hirohito's death in which Takeshita asserted that the war \"had broken out against [Hirohito's] wishes.\" Takeshita's statement provoked outrage in nations in East Asia and Commonwealth nations such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.[93] According to historian Fujiwara, \"The thesis that the Emperor, as an organ of responsibility, could not reverse cabinet decision is a myth fabricated after the war.\"[94]/nAccording to Yinan He, associate professor of international relations at Lehigh University,[95] in the aftermath of the war, conservative Japanese elites created self-whitewashing, self-glorifying national myths that minimized the scope of Japan's war responsibility, which included presenting the emperor as a peace-seeking diplomat and a narrative that separated him from the militarists, whom they described as people who hijacked the Japanese government and led the country into war, shifting the responsibility from the ruling class to only a few military leaders.[69] This narrative also narrowly focuses on the U.S.\u2013Japan conflict, completely ignores the wars Japan waged in Asia, and disregards the atrocities committed by Japanese troops during the war.[69] Japanese elites created the narrative in an attempt to avoid tarnishing the national image and regain the international acceptance of the country.[69]/nKentar\u014d Awaya\u00a0[Wikidata] said that post-war Japanese public opinion supporting protection of the Emperor was influenced by U.S. propaganda promoting the view that the Emperor together with the Japanese people had been fooled by the military.[96]/nIn the years immediately after Hirohito's death, scholars who spoke out against the emperor were threatened and attacked by right-wing extremists. Susan Chira reported, \"Scholars who have spoken out against the late Emperor have received threatening phone calls from Japan's extremist right wing.\"[93] One example of actual violence occurred in 1990 when the mayor of Nagasaki, Hitoshi Motoshima, was shot and critically wounded by a member of the ultranationalist group, Seikijuku. A year before, in 1989, Motoshima had broken what was characterized as \"one of [Japan's] most sensitive taboos\" by asserting that Emperor Hirohito bore responsibility for World War II.[97]/nRegarding Hirohito's exemption from trial before the International Military Tribunal of the Far East, opinions were not unanimous. Sir William Webb, the president of the tribunal, declared: \"This immunity of the Emperor is contrasted with the part he played in launching the war in the Pacific, is, I think, a matter which the tribunal should take into consideration in imposing the sentences.\"[98] Likewise, the French judge, Henri Bernard, wrote about Hirohito's accountability that the declaration of war by Japan \"had a principal author who escaped all prosecution and of whom in any case the present defendants could only be considered accomplices.\"[99]/nAn account from the Vice Interior Minister in 1941, Michio Yuzawa, asserts that Hirohito was \"at ease\" with the attack on Pearl Harbor \"once he had made a decision.\"[100]/nSince his death in 1989, historians have discovered evidence that prove Hirohito's culpability for the war, and that he was not a passive figurehead manipulated by those around him.[69]/nAccording to notebooks by Michiji Tajima, a top Imperial Household Agency official who took office after the war, Emperor Hirohito privately expressed regret about the atrocities that were committed by Japanese troops during the Nanjing Massacre.[101] In addition to feeling remorseful about his own role in the war, he \"fell short by allowing radical elements of the military to drive the conduct of the war.\"[101]/nIn late July 2018, the bookseller Takeo Hatano, an acquaintance of the descendants of Michio Yuzawa (Japanese Vice Interior Minister in 1941), released to Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper a memo by Yuzawa that Hatano had kept for nine years since he received it from Yuzawa's family. The bookseller said: \"It took me nine years to come forward, as I was afraid of a backlash. But now I hope the memo would help us figure out what really happened during the war, in which 3.1 million people were killed.\"[100]/nTakahisa Furukawa, expert on wartime history from Nihon University, confirmed the authenticity of the memo, calling it \"the first look at the thinking of Emperor Hirohito and Prime Minister Hideki Tojo on the eve of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\"[100]/nIn this document, Yuzawa details a conversation he had with Tojo a few hours before the attack. The Vice Minister quotes Tojo saying:/n\"The Emperor seemed at ease and unshakable once he had made a decision.\"[100]/n\"If His Majesty had any regret over negotiations with Britain and the U.S., he would have looked somewhat grim. There was no such indication, which must be a result of his determination. I'm completely relieved. Given the current conditions, I could say we have practically won already.\"[100]/nHistorian Furukawa concluded from Yuzawa's memo:/n\"Tojo is a bureaucrat who was incapable of making own decisions, so he turned to the Emperor as his supervisor. That's why he had to report everything for the Emperor to decide. If the Emperor didn't say no, then he would proceed.\"[100]/nShinobu Kobayashi was the Emperor's chamberlain from April 1974 until June 2000. Kobayashi kept a diary with near-daily remarks of Hirohito for 26 years. It was made public on Wednesday 22 August 2018.[102] According to Takahisa Furukawa, a professor of modern Japanese history at Nihon University, the diary reveals that the emperor \"gravely took responsibility for the war for a long time, and as he got older, that feeling became stronger.\"[1]/nJennifer Lind, associate professor of government at Dartmouth College and a specialist in Japanese war memory said:/n\"Over the years, these different pieces of evidence have trickled out and historians have amassed this picture of culpability and how he was reflecting on that. This is another piece of the puzzle that very much confirms that the picture that was taking place before, which is that he was extremely culpable, and after the war he was devastated about this.\"[1]/nAn entry dated 27 May 1980 said the Emperor wanted to express his regret about the Sino-Japanese war to former Chinese Premier Hua Guofeng who visited at the time, but was stopped by senior members of the Imperial Household Agency due to fear of backlash from far right groups.[102]/nAn entry dated 7 April 1987 said the Emperor was haunted by discussions of his wartime responsibility and, as a result, was losing his will to live.[102]/nIn September 2021, 25 diaries, pocket notebooks and memos by Sabur\u014d Hyakutake (Emperor Hirohito's Grand Chamberlain from 1936 to 1944) deposited by his relatives to the library of the University of Tokyo's graduate schools for law and politics became available to the public.[103]/nHyakutake's diary quotes some of Hirohito's ministers and advisers as being worried that the Emperor was getting ahead of them in terms of battle preparations./nThus, Hyakutake quotes Tsuneo Matsudaira, the Imperial Household Minister, saying:/n\"The Emperor appears to have been prepared for war in the face of the tense times.\" (13 October 1941)[103]/nLikewise, Koichi Kido, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, is quoted as saying:/n\"I occasionally have to try to stop him from going too far.\" (13 October 1941)[103]/n\"The Emperor's resolve appears to be going too far.\" (20 November 1941)[103]/n\"I requested the Emperor to say things to give the impression that Japan will exhaust all measures to pursue peace when the Foreign Minister is present.\" (20 November 1941)[103]/nSeiichi Chadani, professor of modern Japanese history with Shigakukan University who has studied Hirohito's actions before and during the war said on the discovery of Hyakutake's diary:/n\"The archives available so far, including his biography compiled by the Imperial Household Agency, contained no detailed descriptions that his aides expressed concerns about Hirohito leaning toward Japan's entry into the war.\"[103]/n\"(Hyakutake's diary) is a significant record penned by one of the close aides to the Emperor documenting the process of how Japan's leaders led to the war.\"[103]/nThe declassified January 1989 British government assessment of Hirohito describes him as \"too weak to alter the course of events\" and Hirohito was \"powerless\" and comparisons with Hitler are \"ridiculously wide off the mark.\" Hirohito's power was limited by ministers and the military and if he asserted his views too much he would have been replaced by another member of the royal family.[104]/nIndian jurist Radhabinod Pal opposed the International Military Tribunal and made a 1,235-page judgment.[105] He found the entire prosecution case to be weak regarding the conspiracy to commit an act of aggressive war with brutalization and subjugation of conquered nations. Pal said there is \"no evidence, testimonial or circumstantial, concomitant, prospectant, restrospectant, that would in any way lead to the inference that the government in any way permitted the commission of such offenses\".[106] He added that conspiracy to wage aggressive war was not illegal in 1937, or at any point since.[106] Pal supported the acquittal of all of the defendants. He considered the Japanese military operations as justified, because Chiang Kai-shek supported the boycott of trade operations by the Western Powers, particularly the United States boycott of oil exports to Japan. Pal argued the attacks on neighboring territories were justified to protect the Japanese Empire from an aggressive environment, especially the Soviet Union. He considered that to be self-defense operations which are not criminal. Pal said \"the real culprits are not before us\" and concluded that \"only a lost war is an international crime\"./nA January 1989 declassified British government assessment of Hirohito said the Emperor was \"uneasy with Japan's drift to war in the 1930s and 1940s but was too weak to alter the course of events.\" The dispatch by John Whitehead, former ambassador of the United Kingdom to Japan, to Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe was declassified on Thursday 20 July 2017 at the National Archives in London. The letter was written shortly after Hirohito's death.\nBritain's ambassador to Japan John Whitehead stated in 1989:[104]/n\"By personality and temperament, Hirohito was ill-suited to the role assigned to him by destiny. The successors of the men who had led the Meiji Restoration yearned for a charismatic warrior king. Instead, they were given an introspective prince who grew up to be more at home in the science laboratory than on the military parade ground. But in his early years, every effort was made to cast him in a different mould.\"[104]/n\"A man of stronger personality than Hirohito might have tried more strenuously to check the growing influence of the military in Japanese politics and the drift of Japan toward war with the western powers.\" \"The contemporary diary evidence suggests that Hirohito was uncomfortable with the direction of Japanese policy.\" \"The consensus of those who have studied the documents of the period is that Hirohito was consistent in attempting to use his personal influence to induce caution and to moderate and even obstruct the growing impetus toward war.\"[104]/nWhitehead concludes that ultimately Hirohito was \"powerless\" and comparisons with Hitler are \"ridiculously wide off the mark.\" If Hirohito acted too insistently with his views he could have been isolated or replaced with a more pliant member of the royal family. The pre-war Meiji Constitution defined Hirohito as \"sacred\" and all-powerful, but according to Whitehead, Hirohito's power was limited by ministers and the military. Whitehead explained after World War II that Hirohito's humility was fundamental for the Japanese people to accept the new 1947 constitution and allied occupation.[104]/nAs Hirohito chose his uncle Prince Higashikuni as prime minister to assist the American occupation, there were attempts by numerous leaders to have him put on trial for alleged war crimes. Many members of the imperial family, such as Princes Chichibu, Takamatsu, and Higashikuni, pressured Hirohito to abdicate so that one of the Princes could serve as regent until Crown Prince Akihito came of age.[113][incomplete short citation] On 27 February 1946, Hirohito's youngest brother, Prince Mikasa, even stood up in the privy council and indirectly urged Hirohito to step down and accept responsibility for Japan's defeat. According to Minister of Welfare Ashida's diary, \"Everyone seemed to ponder Mikasa's words. Never have I seen His Majesty's face so pale.\"[114]/nU.S. General Douglas MacArthur insisted that Emperor Hirohito retain the throne. MacArthur saw Hirohito as a symbol of the continuity and cohesion of the Japanese people. Some historians criticize the decision to exonerate Hirohito and all members of the imperial family who were implicated in the war, such as Prince Chichibu, Prince Asaka, Prince Higashikuni, and Prince Hiroyasu Fushimi, from criminal prosecutions.[78][page\u00a0needed][115][incomplete short citation]/nBefore the war crime trials actually convened, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, its International Prosecution Section (IPS) and Japanese officials worked behind the scenes not only to prevent the Imperial family from being indicted, but also to influence the testimony of the defendants to ensure that no one implicated Hirohito. High officials in court circles and the Japanese government collaborated with Allied General Headquarters in compiling lists of prospective war criminals, while the individuals arrested as Class A suspects and incarcerated solemnly vowed to protect their sovereign against any possible taint of war responsibility.[116] Thus, \"months before the Tokyo tribunal commenced, MacArthur's highest subordinates were working to attribute ultimate responsibility for Pearl Harbor to Hideki T\u014dj\u014d\"[117] by allowing \"the major criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that Hirohito would be spared from indictment.\"[118] According to John W. Dower, \"This successful campaign to absolve Hirohito of war responsibility knew no bounds. Hirohito was not merely presented as being innocent of any formal acts that might make him culpable to indictment as a war criminal, he was turned into an almost saintly figure who did not even bear moral responsibility for the war.\"[119] According to Bix, \"MacArthur's truly extraordinary measures to save Hirohito from trial as a war criminal had a lasting and profoundly distorting impact on Japanese understanding of the lost war.\"[120][incomplete short citation]/nHirohito was not put on trial, but he was forced[121] to explicitly reject the quasi-official claim that Hirohito of Japan was an arahitogami, i.e., an incarnate divinity. This was motivated by the fact that, according to the Japanese constitution of 1889, Hirohito had a divine power over his country which was derived from the Shinto belief that the Japanese Imperial Family were the descendants of the sun goddess Amaterasu. Hirohito was however persistent in the idea that the Emperor of Japan should be considered a descendant of the gods. In December 1945, he told his vice-grand-chamberlain Michio Kinoshita: \"It is permissible to say that the idea that the Japanese are descendants of the gods is a false conception; but it is absolutely impermissible to call chimerical the idea that the Emperor is a descendant of the gods.\"[77] In any case, the \"renunciation of divinity\" was noted more by foreigners than by Japanese, and seems to have been intended for the consumption of the former.[e] The theory of a constitutional monarchy had already had some proponents in Japan. In 1935, when Tatsukichi Minobe advocated the theory that sovereignty resides in the state, of which the Emperor is just an organ (the tenn\u014d kikan setsu), it caused a furor. He was forced to resign from the House of Peers and his post at the Tokyo Imperial University, his books were banned, and an attempt was made on his life.[122] Not until 1946 was the tremendous step made to alter the Emperor's title from \"imperial sovereign\" to \"constitutional monarch.\"[123]/nAlthough the Emperor had supposedly repudiated claims to divinity, his public position was deliberately left vague, partly because General MacArthur thought him probable to be a useful partner to get the Japanese to accept the occupation and partly due to behind-the-scenes maneuvering by Shigeru Yoshida to thwart attempts to cast him as a European-style monarch./nNevertheless, Hirohito's status as a limited constitutional monarch was formalized with the enactment of the 1947 Constitution\u2013officially, an amendment to the Meiji Constitution. It defined the Emperor as \"the symbol of the state and the unity of the people,\" and stripped him of even nominal power in government matters. His role was limited to matters of state as delineated in the Constitution, and in most cases his actions in that realm were carried out in accordance with the binding instructions of the Cabinet./nFollowing the Iranian Revolution and the end of the short-lived Central African Empire, both in 1979, Hirohito found himself the last monarch in the world to bear any variation of the highest royal title \"emperor.\"/nFor the rest of his life, Hirohito was an active figure in Japanese life and performed many of the duties commonly associated with a constitutional head of state. He and his family maintained a strong public presence, often holding public walkabouts and making public appearances at special events and ceremonies. For example, in 1947, the Emperor made a public visit to Hiroshima and held a speech in front of a massive crowd encouraging the city's citizens. He also played an important role in rebuilding Japan's diplomatic image, traveling abroad to meet with many foreign leaders, including Queen Elizabeth II (1971) and President Gerald Ford (1975). He was not only the first reigning emperor to travel beyond Japan, but also the first to meet a President of the United States.[124] His status and image became strongly positive in the United States.[125]/nIn 1971 (Sh\u014dwa 46), Hirohito visited seven European countries, including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Switzerland again, for 17 days from 27 September to 14 October. In this case, a special aircraft Douglas DC-8 of Japan Airlines was used unlike the previous visit by ship. Although not counted as a visit, at that time, Hirohito stopped by Anchorage, Alaska as a stopover, and met with United States President Richard Nixon from Washington, DC, at the Alaska District Army Command House at Elmendorf Air Force Base./nThe talks between Emperor Hirohito and President Nixon were not planned at the outset, because initially the stop in the United States was only for refueling to visit Europe. However, the meeting was decided in a hurry at the request of the United States. Although the Japanese side accepted the request, Minister for Foreign Affairs Takeo Fukuda made a public telephone call to the Japanese ambassador to the United States Nobuhiko Ushiba, who promoted talks, saying, \"that will cause me a great deal of trouble. We want to correct the perceptions of the other party.\" At that time, Foreign Minister Fukuda was worried that President Nixon's talks with Hirohito would be used to repair the deteriorating Japan\u2013U.S. relations, and he was concerned that the premise of the symbolic emperor system could fluctuate.[127][128]/nThere was an early visit, with deep royal exchanges in Denmark and Belgium, and in France they were warmly welcomed. In France, Hirohito reunited with Edward VIII, who had abdicated in 1936 and was virtually in exile, and they chatted for a while. However, protests were held in Britain and the Netherlands by veterans who had served in the South-East Asian theatre and civilian victims of the brutal occupation there. In the Netherlands, raw eggs and vacuum flasks were thrown. The protest was so severe that Empress K\u014djun, who accompanied the Hirohito, was exhausted. In the United Kingdom, protestors stood in silence and turned their backs when Hirohito's carriage passed them while others wore red gloves to symbolize the dead.[129] The satirical magazine Private Eye used a racist double entendre to refer to Hirohito's visit (\"nasty Nip in the air\").[130] In West Germany, the Japanese monarch's visit was met with hostile far-left protests, participants of which viewed Hirohito as the East Asian equivalent of Adolf Hitler and referred to him as \"Hirohitler\", and prompted a wider comparative discussion of the memory and perception of Axis war crimes. The protests against Hirohito's visit also condemned and highlighted what they perceived as mutual Japanese and West German complicity in and enabling of the American war effort against communism in Vietnam.[131]/nRegarding these protests and opposition, Emperor Hirohito was not surprised to have received a report in advance at a press conference on 12 November after returning to Japan and said that \"I do not think that welcome can be ignored\" from each country.[132] Also, at a press conference following their golden wedding anniversary three years later, along with the Empress, he mentioned this visit to Europe as his most enjoyable memory in 50 years.[132]/nIn 1975, Hirohito visited the United States for 14 days from 30 September to 14 October, at the invitation of President Gerald Ford. The visit was the first such event in US\u2013Japanese history.[f] The United States Army, Navy and Air Force, as well as the Marine Corps and the Coast Guard honored the state visit. Before and after the visit, a series of terrorist attacks in Japan were caused by anti-American left-wing organizations such as the East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front./nAfter arriving in Williamsburg on 30 September 1975, Emperor Hirohito stayed in the United States for two weeks.[133] The official meeting with President Ford occurred on 2 October.[134] On 3 October, Hirohito visited Arlington National Cemetery.[135] On 6 October, Emperor Hirohito and Empress Nagako visited Vice President and Mrs. Rockefeller at their home in Westchester County, New York.[136]/nIn a speech at the White House state dinner, Hirohito read, \"Thanks to the United States for helping to rebuild Japan after the war.\" During his stay in Los Angeles, he visited Disneyland, and a smiling photo next to Mickey Mouse adorned the newspapers,[137] and there was talk about the purchase of a Mickey Mouse watch. Two types of commemorative stamps and stamp sheets were issued on the day of their return to Japan[citation needed] which demonstrated that the visit had been a significant undertaking. This was the last visit of Emperor Sh\u014dwa to the United States. The official press conference held by the Emperor and Empress before and after their visit also marked a breakthrough.[citation needed]/nHirohito was deeply interested in and well-informed about marine biology, and the Imperial Palace contained a laboratory from which Hirohito published several papers in the field under his personal name \"Hirohito\".[138] His contributions included the description of several dozen species of Hydrozoa new to science.[139]/nHirohito maintained an official boycott of the Yasukuni Shrine after it was revealed to him that Class-A war criminals had secretly been enshrined after its post-war rededication. This boycott lasted from 1978 until his death and has been continued by his successors, Akihito and Naruhito.[140]/nOn 20 July 2006, Nihon Keizai Shimbun published a front-page article about the discovery of a memorandum detailing the reason that Hirohito stopped visiting Yasukuni. The memorandum, kept by former chief of Imperial Household Agency Tomohiko Tomita, confirms for the first time that the enshrinement of 14 Class-A war criminals in Yasukuni was the reason for the boycott. Tomita recorded in detail the contents of his conversations with Hirohito in his diaries and notebooks. According to the memorandum, in 1988, Hirohito expressed his strong displeasure at the decision made by Yasukuni Shrine to include Class-A war criminals in the list of war dead honored there by saying, \"At some point, Class-A criminals became enshrined, including Matsuoka and Shiratori. I heard Tsukuba acted cautiously.\" Tsukuba is believed to refer to Fujimaro Tsukuba, the former chief Yasukuni priest at the time, who decided not to enshrine the war criminals despite having received in 1966 the list of war dead compiled by the government. \"What's on the mind of Matsudaira's son, who is the current head priest?\" \"Matsudaira had a strong wish for peace, but the child didn't know the parent's heart.

He was a pioneer of the Green Revolution movement that changed the food landscape of India by growing abundant food grains, thereby reducing the possibility of any famine in the country. His wife was Gertrude Emerson Sen, an American author and specialist on Asia. He founded the Vivekananda Laboratory in the Almora region of the Himalayas. He was a friend of many notable people, such as Indian Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, poet Rabindranath Tagore, Julian Huxley, and D. H. Lawrence. Sen was also associated with the Ramakrishna Order and the Ramakrishna Vivekananda movement, as well as with Jagadish Chandra Bose, the Indian scientist, and Sister Nivedita, the writer, orator, freedom fighter and direct disciple of Swami Vivekananda.[1] The Government of India awarded him the third-highest civilian honour of Padma Bhushan in 1957.[2]/nSen was born in Bishnupur area in Bengal in 1887. His father's name was Rameswar Sen, who was the first graduate of Calcutta University from Bankura district of Bengal. His mother's name was Prasannamoyi Devi. Sens elder brother Sureswar Sen was an ardent devotee of the Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi.[3] Owing to the untimely death of Rameshwar, the Sen family was in financial strain. Sen (or Boshi as he came to be known in his later life), completed his school education by staying with a sister in Ranchi. He passed the BSc examination from St. Xavier's College in Calcutta. He was introduced to Ramakrishna Order by his friend Bibhuti Bhushon Ghosh. Sen was intimately associated with Swami Sadananda, also called Gupta Maharaj, a direct monastic disciple of Swami Vivekananda. Boshi also took a few photographs of the Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi./nAt this time he also came in contact with Sister Nivedita who introduced him to Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose, the famous Indian scientist, biologist and botanist. Boshi worked with Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose for several years in Bose Institute and even accompanied him to London. In 1923, he travelled to the United States on invitation of an American scientist, Glen Overton. After his return to India, Boshi wanted to do independent research, and he parted from Dr. J.C Bose and founded his own laboratory in a small kitchen in Bosepara Lane, Baghbazar, where he was staying. The laboratory was named after Swami Vivekananda.\nBoshi met Romain Rolland in 1928 and had a discussion on the lives of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda with him. He met Albert Einstein in 1930 in Berlin and had discussions on Science and Religion.[1][4]/nIn 1924 Sister Christine or Christine Greenstidel a direct American disciple of Swami Vivekananda had come down to India and took up her accommodation with Boshi. Boshi relocated to Almora where he set up his laboratory in Kundan House, rented with the money of Josephine MacLeod, and Sister Christine stayed there with him for two years. In 1928 Boshi accompanied Sister Christine to New York to help her recover from a failing health, where she died.[5] In Almora Boshi he met Gertrude Emerson, an explorer, writer and founding member of Society of Woman Geographers.[6] She was a graduate of Chicago University, a fellow of Royal Geographical Society and also editor of the Asia Magazine. In 1932 Boshi and Gertrude were married to each other. She became Gertrude Emerson Sen. They had many diginataries as their acquaintances in Kundan House, the most notable among them being Rabindranath Tagore, the mystic poet and Nobel laureate, Jawaharlal Nehru, Julian Huxley, note danceuse Uday Shankar, Swami Virajananda, the then head of Ramakrishna Order, Carl Jung etc.[7]/nThe Great Bengal Famine of 1943 had changed Sen's outlook towards research and from research on plant cell his focus shifted to applied research on agriculture and food grain productivity. In this matter he was deeply influenced by the humanistic endeavours and messages of Swami Vivekananda who identified food problem as one of the major problems plaguing British India.[1][8] His research in practical and applied agriculture included plant introduction, plant breeding and production of hybrid seeds of maize, jowar, bajra, and onion. He followed the claims of Trofim Lysenko to develop so-called vernalized crop varieties.[9] In his Vivekananda Laboratory, he was successful in production of hybrid maize seeds and hybrid onions. For his pioneering work which heralded Green Revolution in India, he was awarded Padma Bhushan in 1957 and Watmull award in 1962. He was allotted land for the expansion of his work by Uttar Pradesh Government in Hawalbagh. In 1959 his Laboratory was transferred to U. P.

He was among the first modern thinkers who viewed the universe as an entity governed by natural laws (nomological determinism). He was also an early literate proponent of biological evolution, maintaining that humans and other apes have common ancestors. He was executed in Toulouse./nVanini was born at Taurisano near Lecce, and studied philosophy and theology at Naples. Afterwards, he applied himself to the physical studies, chiefly medicine and astronomy, which had come into vogue with the Renaissance. Like Giordano Bruno, he attacked scholasticism.[2]/nFrom Naples he went to Padua, where he came under the influence of the Alexandrist Pietro Pomponazzi, whom he styled his divine master. Subsequently, he led a roving life in France, Switzerland and the Low Countries, supporting himself by giving lessons and disseminating radical ideas. He was obliged to flee to England in 1612 but was imprisoned in London for 49 days.[2]/nReturning to Italy, he made an attempt to teach in Genoa but was driven again to France, where he tried to clear himself of suspicion by publishing a book against atheism: Amphitheatrum Aeternae Providentiae Divino-Magicum (1615). Though the definitions of God are somewhat pantheistic, the book served its immediate purpose. Although Vanini did not expound his true views in his first book, he did in his second: De Admirandis Naturae Reginae Deaeque Mortalium Arcanis (Paris, 1616). This was originally certified by two doctors of the Sorbonne, but was later re-examined and condemned.[2]/nVanini then left Paris, where he had been staying as chaplain to the Marechal de Bassompierre, and began to teach in Toulouse. In November 1618, he was arrested and, after a prolonged trial, was condemned to have his tongue cut out, to be strangled at the stake and to have his body burned to ashes. The sentence was executed on 9 February 1619.[2]/nLucilio Vanini was born in 1585 in Taurisano, Terra d'Otranto, Italy. His father was Giovan Battista Vanini, a businessman from Tresana in Tuscany, while his mother was the daughter of a man named Lopez de Noguera, a customs contractor of the Spanish royal family's lands in Bari, Terra d'Otranto, Capitanata, and Basilicata. A document dated August 1612, discovered in the Vatican Secret Archives, describes Vanini as of Apulia, which is consistent with the native land he mentions in his own works./nThe government census of the population of the hamlet of Taurisano, in 1596, includes the names of Giovan Battista Vanini, his lawful son Alexander, born in 1582, and his natural son Giovan Francesco, while there is no mention of Vanini's wife or of another lawful son called Lucilio (or Giulio Cesare). In 1603 Giovan Battista Vanini is reported for the last time in Taurisano./nLucilio Vanini entered the University of Naples in 1599.[3] In 1603 he entered the Carmelite order,[4] taking the name of Fra Gabriele. He earned a doctorate in canon and civil law from the University of Naples on 6 June 1606.[3]/nAfterwards, he remained in the Naples area for two years, apparently living as a friar,[3] or alternatively he returned to Lecce and studied the new Renaissance sciences, chiefly medicine and astronomy. By now, he had assimilated much knowledge and \"speaks very good Latin and with great ease, is tall and a bit thin, has brown hair, an aquiline nose, lively eyes and a pleasant and ingenious physiognomy\"./nIn (probably) 1606, Vanini's father died in Naples. Vanini, now come of age, was recognised by a court in the capital as heir of Giovan Battista and guardian of his brother Alexander. With a series of deeds and power of attorney drawn up in Naples, Vanini began to settle the financial consequences of the death of his father: selling a house he owned in Ugento, a few miles from his home country; in 1607 mandating a maternal uncle to fulfil assignments of the same type; in 1608 instructing friend Scarciglia to recover a sum and sell some goods remaining in Taurisano and held in custody by the two brothers./nIn 1608, Vanini moved to Padua, a town under the rule of Venice, to study theology at that university (although there is no record of him subsequently obtaining a degree).[3] While there he came into contact with the group led by Paolo Sarpi that, with the support of the English embassy in Venice, fueled anti-papal polemics. In 1611 he participated in the Lenten sermons, attracting the suspicions of the religious authorities. During that period, the controversy over the 1606 interdict placed on the Republic of Venice by Pope Paul V was still raging, and Vanini showed himself unambiguously in favour of the Republic.[3] Consequently, the Prior General of his order, Enrico Silvio, commanded him to return to Naples, where he would have been disciplined, probably severely, but instead Vanini sought refuge with the English ambassador to Venice in 1612.[3]/nVanini then fled to England, along with his Genoese companion Bonaventure Genocchi. They passed through Bologna, Milan, the Swiss canton of Graub\u00fcnden, and descended via the Rhine, through Germany and the Netherlands, to the North Sea coast and the English Channel, finally reaching London and the Lambeth residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Here the two remained for nearly two years, hiding their true identity from their English guests. In July 1612, they both renounced their Catholic faith and embraced Anglicanism./nBy 1613, however, Vanini was having doubts, so he appealed to the Pope to be allowed back into the Catholic fold, but as a secular priest rather than as a friar; the request was granted by the Pope himself.[3] Around the start of 1614, Vanini visited the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford and confided to some acquaintances his imminent flight from England, so in January, he and Genocchi were arrested on the orders of the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Abbot. They managed to escape however, Genocchi in February 1614 and Vanini in March. The Spanish ambassador in London and the chaplain of the embassy of the Venetian Republic were thought to have engineered their escapes. The two passed through the hands of the papal nuncio in Flanders, Guido Bentivoglio, to the papal nuncio in Paris, Roberto Ubaldini./nIn Paris, in the summer of 1614, Vanini subscribed to the principles of the Council of Trent, to prove the sincerity of his return to the Catholic faith. He then journeyed to Italy, going first to Rome, where he had to face the difficult final stages of the process in the court of the Inquisition, then to Genoa for a few months, where he found his friend Genocchi and taught philosophy to children of Scipio Doria for a time./nDespite assurances, the return of Vanini and Genocchi was not entirely peaceful; in January 1615 Genocchi was arrested by the Inquisitor of Genoa. Vanini therefore, fearing the same fate, ran away again to France and headed to Lyon. There, in June 1615, he published Amphitheatrum, a book against atheism, which he hoped would clear his name with the Roman authorities./nA short time later Vanini returned to Paris, where he asked Nuncio Ubaldini to intervene on his behalf with the authorities in Rome. Insufficiently assured, Vanini decided not to return to Italy, and instead cultivated connections with prestigious elements of the French nobility./nIn 1616, Vanini completed the second of his two works, De Admirandis, and got it approved by two theologians at the Sorbonne. The work was published in September in Paris. It was dedicated to Fran\u00e7ois de Bassompierre, a powerful man at the court of Marie de' Medici, and was printed by Adrien P\u00e9rier, a Protestant. The work was immediately successful among those aristocratic circles populated by young spirits who looked with interest to the cultural and scientific innovations that came from Italy. The De Admirandis was a summa, lively and brilliant, of the new knowledge, and became a kind of \"manifesto\" for these cultural free spirits, giving Vanini a chance to stay safe in circles close to the French court. However, a few days after the publication of the work, the two theologians at the Sorbonne who had expressed their approval were presented to the Faculty of Theology in formal session and the outcome was a de facto ban on the movement of the text./nNow, unwelcome in England, unable to return to Italy and threatened by some circles of French Catholics, Vanini saw his room for manoeuvre shrinking and his chances of finding a stable place in French society failing. Fearing that a court case would be started against him in Paris, he fled and went into hiding at Redon Abbey in Brittany, where Abbott Arthur d'\u00c9pinay de Saint-Luc acted as his protector. But other factors gave cause for concern: in April 1617 Concino Concini, favorite of Marie de' Medici, was killed in Paris, giving rise to a wave of hostility to Italian residents at court./nIn the following months, a mysterious Italian, with a strange name (Pompeo Uciglio[3]) and in possession of great knowledge but an uncertain past, appeared in some cities of Guyenne, then the Languedoc and finally Toulouse. Duke Henri II de Montmorency, protector of esprits forts of the time, was the governor of this region and seemed to grant protection to the fugitive, who still continued to keep carefully hidden./nThe presence of this mysterious character in Toulouse did not however pass unnoticed and attracted the suspicions of the authorities. In August 1618 he was apprehended and interrogated. In February 1619, the Parlement of Toulouse found him guilty of atheism and blasphemy and, in accordance with the regulations of the time, his tongue was cut out, he was strangled and his body was burned. After the execution it emerged that the stranger was in fact Vanini./nAmphitheatrum Aeternae Providentiae divino-magicum, christiano-physicum, necnon astrologo-catholicum adversus veteres philosophos, atheos, epicureos, peripateticos et stoicos (possible translation: \"Amphitheatre of Eternal Providence \u2013 Religio-magical, Christian-physical and Astrologico-Catholic \u2013 against the Ancient Philosophers, Atheists, Epicureans, Peripatetics and Stoics\"), published in Lyon in 1615, consists of 50 exercises, which aim to demonstrate the existence of God, to define His essence, to describe His providence and to examine or refute the opinions of Pythagoras, Protagoras, Cicero, Boethius, Thomas Aquinas, the Epicureans, Aristotle, Averroes, Gerolamo Cardano, the Peripatetics, the Stoics, etc. on this subject./nDe Admirandis Naturae Reginae Deaeque Mortalium Arcanis (possible translation: \"On the Marvelous Secrets of Nature, the Queen and Goddess of Mortals\"), printed in Paris in 1616 by publisher Adrien P\u00e9rier, is divided into four books:/nThese contain a total of 60 dialogues (but really only 59, as dialogue XXXV is absent), which take place between the author, in the role of disseminator of knowledge, and an imaginary Alessandro, who urges his interlocutor to list and explain the mysteries of nature found around and within man./nIn a mixture of reinterpretation of ancient knowledge and the dissemination of new scientific and religious theories, the protagonist discusses: the material, figure, colour, form, energy and eternity of heaven; the motion and the central pole of the heavens; the sun, the moon, the stars; fire; comets and rainbows; lightning, snow and rain; the motion and rest of projectiles in the air; the impulsion of mortars and crossbows; winds and breezes; corrupt airs; the element of water; the birth of the rivers; the rising of the Nile; the extent and saltiness of the sea; the roar and the motion of the water; the motion of projectiles; the creation of islands and mountains, as well as the cause of earthquakes; the genesis, root and colour of the gems, as well as spots of stones; life, food, and the death of the stones; the strength of the magnet to attract iron and its direction toward the Earth's poles; plants; the explanation to be given to certain phenomena of everyday life; semen; the reproduction, nature, respiration and nutrition of fish; the reproduction of birds; the reproduction of bees; the first generation of man; stains contracted by children in the womb; the generation of male and female; parts of monsters; the faces of children covered by larvae; the growth of man; the length of human life; sight; hearing; smell; taste; touch and tickle; the affections of man; God; appearances in the air; oracles; the Sibyls; the possessed; sacred images of the pagans; augurs; the miraculous healing of diseases reported in pagan times; the resurrection of the dead; witchcraft; dreams./nThe naturalistic interpretation of supernatural phenomena that Pietro Pomponazzi \u2013 called by Vanini magister meus, divinus praeceptor meus, nostri seculi Philosophorum princeps \u2013 had given in the early 16th century in his treatise De Incantationibus was summarised in De Admirandis Naturae, where, in simple and elegant prose, Vanini also referred to Gerolamo Cardano, Julius Caesar Scaliger and other 16th century thinkers./n\"God acts on sublunary beings [humans] using the sky as a tool\": hence the natural and rational explanation of the allegedly supernatural phenomena, since even astrology was considered a science. God may use such phenomena to warn the people, and especially rulers, of danger. But the real origin of supernatural phenomena is, for Vanini, the human imagination, which can sometimes change the appearance of external reality. For the ecclesiastical \"impostors\" that promulgate false beliefs to gain wealth and power, and rulers interested in dominating the people, according to Vanini, \"all religious things are false and fake principles to teach the naive populace that, when reason cannot be reached, at least practice religion\"./nFollowing Pietro Pomponazzi and Simone Porzio in their interpretation of the Aristotelian texts and the commentary thereon by Alexander of Aphrodisias, Vanini denied the immortality of the soul and attacked the Aristotelian cosmos-view. Like Bruno, he denied the difference between the everyday world and the celestial world, saying that both are composed of the same corruptible material. He disputed, in the physical and biological world, finality and the hylomorphic Aristotelian doctrine, and, reconnecting Epicureanism with Lucretius, prepared a new mechanistic-materialistic description of the universe where bodies are likened to a watch, and conceived a first form of universal transformation of living species. He agreed with the Aristotelian eternity of the world, especially considering the temporal aspect, but affirmed the rotation of the earth and appeared to reject the Ptolemaic system in favour of the heliocentric/Copernican system./nIf the first editor of his works, Luigi Corvaglia, and historian Guido De Ruggiero, unjustly, considered his writings simply \"a centone devoid of originality and scientific seriousness\", the Jesuit priest Fran\u00e7ois Garasse, far more worried about the consequences of the spread of his writings, judged them \"a work of such most pernicious atheism as was never released in the last hundred years\". The works of Vanini have been extensively reviewed and revalued by contemporary critics, revealing originality and insights (metaphysical, physical, biological) sometimes well ahead of their time./nSince Vanini in his works obscured his ideas, a typical ploy at the time to avoid serious conflicts with the religious and political authorities, the interpretation of his thought is difficult. However, in the history of philosophy, he has the image of an unbeliever or even an atheist. Considered as one of the fathers of libertinism, he was regarded as a lost soul by conventional Christians, despite having written a defense of the Council of Trent./nTo understand the origins of Vanini's thought one has to look to his cultural background, which was fairly typical of the Renaissance, with a prevalence of elements of Averroistic Aristotelianism but with strong elements of mysticism and Neo-Platonism. On the other hand, he drew from Nicholas of Cusa typical pantheistic elements, similar to those which are also found in Giordano Bruno, but more materialistic. His world view was based on the eternity of matter, and of a God in nature as a \"force\" that shapes, orders and directs. All forms of life, he thought, had originated spontaneously from the earth itself as their creator./nVanini was considered an atheist, but his first work, published in Lyon in 1615, Amphitheatrum, indicates otherwise. As a precursor of libertinism there are many elements that make his teaching close to the thought of the unknown author of the Treatise of the Three Impostors, also a pantheist. Vanini thought in fact that the creators of the three monotheistic religions, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad, were nothing but impostors./nIn De Admirandis are found themes from Amphitheatrum, with refinements and developments that make it his masterpiece and the summary of his philosophy. Denying creation from nothing and the immortality of the soul, he saw God in Nature as its driving force and vital force, both eternal. The stars of heaven he considered a kind of intermediary between God and Nature. The true religion is therefore a \"religion of Nature\" that does not deny God but considers Him a spirit-force./nThe thought of Vanini is quite fragmented and also reflects the complexity of its origins, as he was a religious figure, a naturalist, but also a doctor and in part a magician. What characterizes the prose is the vehemently anti-clerical sentiment. Among the original aspects of his thinking there is a kind of anticipation of Darwinism, because, after a first half in which he argues that the animal species arise by spontaneous generation from the earth, in the second part he seems convinced that they can be transformed into each other and that man comes from \"animals related to man, such as the Barbary apes, the monkeys and apes in general\"./nIn 1623 two works appeared that started the myth of Vanini the atheist: La doctrine curieuse des beaux esprits de ce temps ... of Jesuit Fran\u00e7ois Garasse, and Quaestiones celeberrimae in Genesim cum accurata explicatione ..., of Father Marin Mersenne. The two works, though, instead of turning off the voice of the philosopher, boosted it in an environment that was obviously ready to receive, discuss and recognise the validity of his claims./nIn that same year the name of Vanini was again brought to the attention of French culture during the sensational trial of the poet Th\u00e9ophile de Viau, whose outlook had striking similarities with Vaninian thought./nIn 1624, the monk Marin Mersenne returned to attacking the philosophy of Vanini, analyzing some statements in chapter X of his L'Impi\u00e9t\u00e8 des D\u00e9istes, Ath\u00e9es et Libertins de ce temps, combatu\u00eb, et renversee de point en point par raisons tir\u00e9es de la Philosophie, et de la Theologie, in which the theologian expresses his judgment of the works of Girolamo Cardano and Giordano Bruno./nEven Leibniz, another opponent of libertinism, was strongly opposed to Vanini, considering him evil, a fool and a charlatan./nEnglish intellectuals showed interest in the ideas of Vanini, and it was especially with the work of Charles Blount that Vanini's ideas entered English culture, becoming a cornerstone of libertinism and deism in seventeenth century England./nAn unpublished manuscript in the municipal library of Avignon preserves Observations sur Lucilio Vanini written by Joseph Louis Dominique de Cambis, Marquis de Velleron, but provides only uncertain information on the philosopher, largely rectified by recent studies. In this same period a manuscript copy of the Amphitheatrum, was made or commissioned by Joseph Uriot, which later came to the library of the Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg; currently it is in the W\u00fcrttembergische Landesbibliothek in Stuttgart. Another manuscript copy of the same work is in the Staats und Universit\u00e4tbibliothek in Hamburg, reflecting the continued interest in the thought of Vanini in German culture./nPierre Bayle, in his Various Thoughts on the Occasion of a Comet, cited Vanini as an example of a learned atheist, alongside the ancient figures of Diagoras, Theodorus, and Euhemerus./nIn 1730, the press in London was given a biography of Vanini with an extract of his works, entitled The life of Lucilio (alias Julius Caesar) Vanini, burnt for atheism at Toulouse. With an abstract of his writings. The work debates Vanini's ideas, recognising much merit./nArthur Schopenhauer's 1839 essay 'On the Freedom of the Will' includes Vanini[5] among his account of predecessors who also came to the same conclusion as that of his essay, which Schopenhauer expressed as follows: \"Everything that happens, from the greatest to the smallest, happens necessarily.\"[6]", "10313": "Edward Osborne Wilson ForMemRS (June 10, 1929 \u2013 December 26, 2021) was an American biologist, naturalist, ecologist, and entomologist known for developing the field of sociobiology./nBorn in Alabama, Wilson found an early interest in nature and frequented the outdoors. At age seven, he was partially blinded in a fishing accident. Due to his reduced sight, Wilson resolved to study entomology. After matriculating at the University of Alabama, Wilson transferred to complete his dissertation at Harvard University, where he distinguished himself in multiple fields. In 1956, he co-authored a paper defining the theory of character displacement. In 1967, he developed the theory of island biogeography with Robert MacArthur./nWilson was the Pellegrino University Research Professor Emeritus in Entomology for the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University, a lecturer at Duke University,[2] and a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. The Royal Swedish Academy awarded Wilson the Crafoord Prize. He was a humanist laureate of the International Academy of Humanism.[3][4] He was a two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction (for On Human Nature in 1979, and The Ants in 1991) and a New York Times bestselling author for The Social Conquest of Earth,[5] Letters to a Young Scientist,[5][6] and The Meaning of Human Existence./nWilson's work received both praise and criticism during his lifetime. His book Sociobiology was a particular flashpoint for controversy, and drew criticism from the Sociobiology Study Group.[7][8] Wilson's interpretation of the theory of evolution resulted in a widely reported dispute with Richard Dawkins.[9] Examinations of his letters after his death revealed that he had supported the psychologist J. Philippe Rushton, whose work on race and intelligence is widely regarded by the scientific community as deeply flawed and racist./nEdward Osborne Wilson was born on June 10, 1929, in Birmingham, Alabama. He was the single child of Inez Linnette Freeman and Edward Osborne Wilson Sr.[10] According to his autobiography, Naturalist, he grew up in various towns in the Southern United States which included Mobile, Decatur, and Pensacola.[11] From an early age, he was interested in natural history. His father was an alcoholic who eventually committed suicide. His parents allowed him to bring home black widow spiders and keep them on the porch.[12] They divorced when he was seven years old./nIn the same year that his parents divorced, Wilson blinded himself in his right eye in a fishing accident.[13] Despite the prolonged pain, he did not stop fishing.[14] He did not complain because he was anxious to stay outdoors, and never sought medical treatment.[14] Several months later, his right pupil clouded over with a cataract.[14] He was admitted to Pensacola Hospital to have the lens removed.[14] Wilson writes, in his autobiography, that the \"surgery was a terrifying [19th] century ordeal\".[14] Wilson retained full sight in his left eye, with a vision of 20/10.[14] The 20/10 vision prompted him to focus on \"little things\": \"I noticed butterflies and ants more than other kids did, and took an interest in them automatically.\"[14] Although he had lost his stereoscopic vision, he could still see fine print and the hairs on the bodies of small insects.[14] His reduced ability to observe mammals and birds led him to concentrate on insects./nAt the age of nine, Wilson undertook his first expeditions at Rock Creek Park in Washington, D.C. He began to collect insects and he gained a passion for butterflies. He would capture them using nets made with brooms, coat hangers, and cheesecloth bags.[14] Going on these expeditions led to Wilson's fascination with ants. He describes in his autobiography how one day he pulled the bark of a rotting tree away and discovered citronella ants underneath.[14] The worker ants he found were \"short, fat, brilliant yellow, and emitted a strong lemony odor\".[14] Wilson said the event left a \"vivid and lasting impression\".[14] He also earned the Eagle Scout award and served as Nature Director of his Boy Scouts summer camp. At age\u00a018, intent on becoming an entomologist, he began by collecting flies, but the shortage of insect pins during World War\u00a0II caused him to switch to ants, which could be stored in vials. With the encouragement of Marion R. Smith, a myrmecologist from the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, Wilson began a survey of all the ants of Alabama. This study led him to report the first colony of fire ants in the U.S., near the port of Mobile.[15]/nWilson said he went to 15 or 16 schools during 11 years of schooling.[12] He\nwas concerned that he might not be able to afford to go to a university, and he tried to enlist in the United States Army, intending to earn U.S. government financial support for his education. He failed the Army medical examination due to his impaired eyesight,[14] but was able to afford to enroll in the University of Alabama, where he earned his Bachelor of Science in 1949 and Master of Science in biology in 1950. The next year, Wilson transferred to Harvard University.[14]/nAppointed to the Harvard Society of Fellows, he could travel on overseas expeditions, collecting ant species of Cuba and Mexico and travel the South Pacific, including Australia, New Guinea, Fiji, and New Caledonia, as well as to Sri Lanka. In 1955, he received his Ph.D. and married Irene Kelley.[16][17]/nFrom 1956 until 1996, Wilson was part of the faculty of Harvard. He began as an ant taxonomist and worked on understanding their microevolution, how they developed into new species by escaping environmental disadvantages and moving into new habitats. He developed a theory of the \"taxon cycle\".[16]/nIn collaboration with mathematician William H. Bossert, Wilson developed a classification of pheromones based on insect communication patterns.[18] In the 1960s, he collaborated with mathematician and ecologist Robert MacArthur in developing the theory of species equilibrium. In the 1970s he and biologist Daniel S. Simberloff tested this theory on tiny mangrove islets in the Florida Keys. They eradicated all insect species and observed the repopulation by new species.[19] Wilson and MacArthur's book The Theory of Island Biogeography became a standard ecology text.[16]/nIn 1971, he published The Insect Societies, which argued that insect behavior and the behavior of other animals are influenced by similar evolutionary pressures.[20] In 1973, Wilson was appointed the curator of entomology at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology.[21] In 1975, he published the book Sociobiology: The New Synthesis applying his theories of insect behavior to vertebrates, and in the last chapter, to humans. He speculated that evolved and inherited tendencies were responsible for hierarchical social organization among humans. In 1978 he published On Human Nature, which dealt with the role of biology in the evolution of human culture and won a Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction.[16]/nWilson was named the Frank B. Baird, Jr., Professor of Science in 1976 and, after his retirement from Harvard in 1996, he became the Pellegrino University Professor Emeritus.[21]/nIn 1981 after collaborating with biologist Charles Lumsden, he published Genes, Mind and Culture, a theory of gene-culture coevolution. In 1990 he published The Ants, co-written with zoologist  Bert H\u00f6lldobler, winning his second Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction.[16]/nIn the 1990s, he published The Diversity of Life (1992); an autobiography, Naturalist (1994); and Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge (1998) about the unity of the natural and social sciences.[16] Wilson was praised for his environmental advocacy, and his secular-humanist and deist ideas pertaining to religious and ethical matters.[22]/nWilson was characerized by several titles during his career, including the \"father of biodiversity,\"[23][24] \"ant man,\"[25] and \"Darwin's heir.\"[26][27][28] In a PBS interview, David Attenborough described Wilson as \"a magic name to many of us working in the natural world, for two reasons. First, he is a towering example of a specialist, a world authority. Nobody in the world has ever known as much as Ed Wilson about ants. But, in addition to that intense knowledge and understanding, he has the widest of pictures. He sees the planet and the natural world that it contains in amazing detail but extraordinary coherence\".[29]/nAlthough Dawkins defended Wilson during the so-called \"sociobiology debate\",[30] a disagreement between them arose over the theory of evolution.[9][31] The disagreement began in 2012 when Dawkins wrote a critical review of Wilson's book The Social Conquest of Earth in Prospect Magazine.[9] In the review, Dawkins criticized Wilson for rejecting kin selection and for supporting group selection, labeling it \"bland\" and \"unfocused,\" and he wrote that the book's theoretical errors were \"important, pervasive, and integral to its thesis in a way that renders it impossible to recommend\".[32][33] Wilson responded in the same magazine and wrote that Dawkins made \"little connection to the part he criticizes\" and accused him of engaging in rhetoric.[31]/nIn 2014, Wilson said in an interview, \"There is no dispute between me and Richard Dawkins and there never has been, because he's a journalist, and journalists are people that report what the scientists have found and the arguments I\u2019ve had have actually been with scientists doing research\".[31] Dawkins responded in a tweet: \"I greatly admire EO Wilson & his huge contributions to entomology, ecology, biogeography, conservation, etc. He's just wrong on kin selection\" and later added, \"Anybody who thinks I'm a journalist who reports what other scientists think is invited to read The Extended Phenotype\".[31] Biologist Jerry Coyne wrote that Wilson's remarks were \"unfair, inaccurate, and uncharitable\".[34] In 2021, in an obituary to Wilson, Dawkins stated that their dispute was \"purely scientific\".[35] Dawkins wrote that he stands by his critical review and doesn't regret \"its outspoken tone\", but noted that he also stood by his \"profound admiration for Professor Wilson and his life work\".[35]/nPrior to Wilson's death, his personal correspondences were donated to the Library of Congress at the Library's request.[36] Following his death, several articles were published discussing the discrepancy between Wilson's legacy as a champion of biogeography and conservation biology, and his support of scientific racist pseudoscientist J. Philippe Rushton over several years. Rushton was a controversial psychologist at the University of Western Ontario, who later headed the Pioneer Fund.[36][37][38]/nFrom the late 1980s to the early 1990s, Wilson wrote several emails to Rushton's colleagues defending Rushton's work in the face of widespread criticism for scholarly misconduct, misrepresentation of data, and confirmation bias, all of which were allegedly used by Rushton to support his personal ideas on race.[36] Wilson also sponsored an article written by Rushton in PNAS,[39] and during the review process, Wilson intentionally sought out reviewers for the article who he believed would likely already agree with its premise.[36] Wilson kept his support of Rushton's racist ideologies behind-the-scenes so as to not draw too much attention to himself or tarnish his own reputation.[40] Wilson responded to another request from Rushton to sponsor a second PNAS article with the following: \"You have my support in many ways, but for me to sponsor an article on racial differences in the PNAS would be counterproductive for both of us.\" Wilson also remarked that the reason Rushton's ideologies were not more widely supported is because of the \"... fear of being called racist, which is virtually a death sentence in American academia if taken seriously. I admit that I myself have tended to avoid the subject of Rushton's work, out of fear.\"[36]/nIn 2022, the E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation issued a statement rejecting Wilson's support of Rushton and racism, on behalf of the board of directors and staff.[41]/nWilson used sociobiology and evolutionary principles to explain the behavior of social insects and then to understand the social behavior of other animals, including humans, thus establishing sociobiology as a new scientific field.[42] He argued that all animal behavior, including that of humans, is the product of heredity, environmental stimuli, and past experiences, and that free will is an illusion. He referred to the biological basis of behavior as the \"genetic leash\".[43]:\u200a127\u2013128\u200a The sociobiological view is that all animal social behavior is governed by epigenetic rules worked out by the laws of evolution. This theory and research proved to be seminal, controversial, and influential.[44]/nWilson argued that the unit of selection is a gene, the basic element of heredity. The target of selection is normally the individual who carries an ensemble of genes of certain kinds. With regard to the use of kin selection in explaining the behavior of eusocial insects, the \"new view that I'm proposing is that it was group selection all along, an idea first roughly formulated by Darwin.\"[45]/nSociobiological research was at the time particularly controversial with regard to its application to humans.[46] The theory established a scientific argument for rejecting the common doctrine of tabula rasa, which holds that human beings are born without any innate mental content and that culture functions to increase human knowledge and aid in survival and success.[47]/nSociobiology: The New Synthesis was initially met with praise by most biologists.[7][8] After substantial criticism of the book was launched by the Sociobiology Study Group, associated with the organization Science for the People, a major controversy known as the \"sociobiology debate\" ensued,[7][8] and Wilson was accused of racism, misogyny, and support for eugenics.[48] Several of Wilson's colleagues at Harvard,[49] such as Richard Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould, both members of the Group, were strongly opposed. Both focused their criticism mostly on Wilson's sociobiological writings.[50] Gould, Lewontin, and other members, wrote \"Against 'Sociobiology'\" in an open letter criticizing Wilson's \"deterministic view of human society and human action\".[51] Other public lectures, reading groups, and press releases were organized criticizing Wilson's work. In response, Wilson produced a discussion article entitled \"Academic Vigilantism and the Political Significance of Sociobiology\" in BioScience.[52][53]/nIn February 1978, while participating in a discussion on sociobiology at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Wilson was surrounded, chanted at and doused with water[a] by members of the International Committee Against Racism, who accused Wilson of advocating racism and genetic determinism. Steven Jay Gould, who was present at the event, and Science for the People, which had previously protested Wilson, condemned the attack.[58][55]/nPhilosopher Mary Midgley encountered Sociobiology in the process of writing Beast and Man (1979)[59] and significantly rewrote the book to offer a critique of Wilson's views. Midgley praised the book for the study of animal behavior, clarity, scholarship, and encyclopedic scope, but extensively critiqued Wilson for conceptual confusion, scientism, and anthropomorphism of genetics.[60]/nWilson wrote in his 1978 book On Human Nature, \"The evolutionary epic is probably the best myth we will ever have.\"[61] Wilson's fame prompted use of the morphed phrase epic of evolution.[22] The book won the Pulitzer Prize in 1979.[62]/nWilson, along with Bert H\u00f6lldobler, carried out a systematic study of ants and ant behavior,[63] culminating in the 1990 encyclopedic work The Ants. Because much self-sacrificing behavior on the part of individual ants can be explained on the basis of their genetic interests in the survival of the sisters, with whom they share 75% of their genes (though the actual case is some species' queens mate with multiple males and therefore some workers in a colony would only be 25% related), Wilson argued for a sociobiological explanation for all social behavior on the model of the behavior of the social insects./nWilson said in reference to ants that \"Karl Marx was right, socialism works, it is just that he had the wrong species\".[64] He asserted that individual ants and other eusocial species were able to reach higher Darwinian fitness putting the needs of the colony above their own needs as individuals because they lack reproductive independence: individual ants cannot reproduce without a queen, so they can only increase their fitness by working to enhance the fitness of the colony as a whole. Humans, however, do possess reproductive independence, and so individual humans enjoy their maximum level of Darwinian fitness by looking after their own survival and having their own offspring.[65]/nIn his 1998 book Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge, Wilson discussed methods that have been used to unite the sciences, and might be able to unite the sciences with the humanities. He argued that knowledge is a single, unified thing, not divided between science and humanistic inquiry.[66] Wilson used the term \"consilience\" to describe the synthesis of knowledge from different specialized fields of human endeavor. He defined human nature as a collection of epigenetic rules, the genetic patterns of mental development. He argued that culture and rituals are products, not parts, of human nature. He said art is not part of human nature, but our appreciation of art is. He suggested that concepts such as art appreciation, fear of snakes, or the incest taboo (Westermarck effect) could be studied by scientific methods of the natural sciences and be part of interdisciplinary research./nWilson coined the phrase scientific humanism as \"the only worldview compatible with science's growing knowledge of the real world and the laws of nature\".[67] Wilson argued that it is best suited to improve the human condition. In 2003, he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.[68]/nOn the question of God, Wilson described his position as \"provisional deism\"[69] and explicitly denied the label of \"atheist\", preferring \"agnostic\".[70] He explained his faith as a trajectory away from traditional beliefs: \"I drifted away from the church, not definitively agnostic or atheistic, just Baptist & Christian no more.\"[43] Wilson argued that belief in God and the rituals of religion are products of evolution.[71] He argued that they should not be rejected or dismissed, but further investigated by science to better understand their significance to human nature. In his book The Creation, Wilson wrote that scientists ought to \"offer the hand of friendship\" to religious leaders and build an alliance with them, stating that \"Science and religion are two of the most potent forces on Earth and they should come together to save the creation.\"[72]/nWilson made an appeal to the religious community on the lecture circuit at Midland College, Texas, for example, and that \"the appeal received a 'massive reply'\", that a covenant had been written and that a \"partnership will work to a substantial degree as time goes on\".[73]/nIn a New Scientist interview published on January 21, 2015, however, Wilson said that religious faith is \"dragging us down\", and/nI would say that for the sake of human progress, the best thing we could possibly do would be to diminish, to the point of eliminating, religious faiths. But certainly not eliminating the natural yearnings of our species or the asking of these great questions.[74]/nWilson said that, if he could start his life over he would work in microbial ecology, when discussing the reinvigoration of his original fields of study since the 1960s.[75] He studied the mass extinctions of the 20th century and their relationship to modern society, and identifying mass extinction as the greatest threat to Earth's future.[76] In 1998 argued for an ecological approach at the Capitol:/nNow when you cut a forest, an ancient forest in particular, you are not just removing a lot of big trees and a few birds fluttering around in the canopy. You are drastically imperiling a vast array of species within a few square miles of you. The number of these species may go to tens of thousands.\u00a0... Many of them are still unknown to science, and science has not yet discovered the key role undoubtedly played in the maintenance of that ecosystem, as in the case of fungi, microorganisms, and many of the insects.[77]/nFrom the late 1970s Wilson was actively involved in the global conservation of biodiversity, contributing and promoting research. In 1984 he published Biophilia, a work that explored the evolutionary and psychological basis of humanity's attraction to the natural environment. This work introduced the word biophilia which influenced the shaping of modern conservation ethics. In 1988 Wilson edited the BioDiversity volume, based on the proceedings of the first US national conference on the subject, which also introduced the term biodiversity into the language. This work was very influential in creating the modern field of biodiversity studies.[78] In 2011, Wilson led scientific expeditions to the Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique and the archipelagos of Vanuatu and New Caledonia in the southwest Pacific. Wilson was part of the international conservation movement, as a consultant to Columbia University's Earth Institute, as a director of the American Museum of Natural History, Conservation International, The Nature Conservancy and the World Wildlife Fund.[16]/nUnderstanding the scale of the extinction crisis led him to advocate for forest protection,[77] including the \"Act to Save America's Forests\", first introduced in 1998 and reintroduced in 2008, but never passed.[79] The Forests Now Declaration called for new markets-based mechanisms to protect tropical forests.[80] Wilson once said destroying a rainforest for economic gain was like burning a Renaissance painting to cook a meal.[81] In 2014, Wilson called for setting aside 50% of Earth's surface for other species to thrive in as the only possible strategy to solve the extinction crisis. The idea became the basis for his book Half-Earth (2016) and for the Half-Earth Project of the E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation.[82][83] Wilson's influence regarding ecology through popular science was discussed by Alan G. Gross in The Scientific Sublime (2018).[84]/nWilson was instrumental in launching the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL)[85] initiative with the goal of creating a global database to include information on the 1.9 million species recognized by science. Currently, it includes information on practically all known species. This open and searchable digital repository for organism traits, measurements, interactions and other data has more than 300 international partners and countless scientists providing global users' access to knowledge of life on Earth. For his part, Wilson discovered and described more than 400 species of ants.[86][87]/nIn 1996, Wilson officially retired from Harvard University, where he continued to hold the positions of Professor Emeritus and Honorary Curator in Entomology.[88] \nHe fully retired from Harvard in 2002 at age 73. After stepping down, he published more than a dozen books, including a digital biology textbook for the iPad.[10][89]/nHe founded the E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation, which finances the PEN/E. O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award and is an \"independent foundation\" at the Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke University. Wilson became a special lecturer at Duke University as part of the agreement.[90]/nWilson and his wife, Irene, resided in Lexington, Massachusetts.[16] He had a daughter, Catherine.[81] He was preceded in death by his wife (on August 7, 2021) and died in nearby Burlington on December 26, 2021, at the age of 92.[10][89]/nWilson's scientific and conservation honors include:", "68823115": "Beate Sodeik is a German cell biologist who is Professor of Medical Sciences at the Hannover Medical School.

In his early career, he pioneered techniques for the aquaculture of oysters and clams. He is best known for his work on airborne infections. Wells identified that tuberculosis could be transmitted through air via the nuclei of evaporated respiratory droplets, and developed the Wells curve to describe what happens to respiratory droplets after they have been expelled into the air./nWells was born c. 1886 in Boston, with a sister and two brothers.[1] Wells served in the military during World War I.[2]  He married Mildred Weeks, a physician,[3] and had a son.[2]/nWells was chairman of the American Public Health Association's subcommittee on bacteriologic procedures in air analysis, and chairman of the American Society for Heating and Ventilation Engineers' subcommittee on air sanitation. In 1950, the American Public Health Association honored his 40 years of service.[1]/nIn 1954, Wells' career moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where he was a research associate at Johns Hopkins University, conducted research at the Veterans Administration Hospital, and consulted on respiratory disease for the Veterans Administration.[1] He and his family lived in a remote part of eastern Maryland. One of his colleagues, Richard L. Riley, described him as \"an eccentric genius.\"[2]/nIn the late 1950s, Wells collapsed, paralyzed from the waist down. After his initial hospitalization, he was transferred to the VA Hospital in Baltimore where he was overseeing a long-term tuberculosis study. He experienced periods of psychosis but continued to advise on research when lucid.[2] He died on September 9, 1963, at the age of 76.[1]/nBetween 1920 and 1926, Wells pioneered aquaculture techniques to culture bivalves. Wells was experimenting with the recently-invented De Laval milk clarifier, and discovered microscopic oyster larvae in the denser portion of clarified seawater.[4] One previous experimenter, William Keith Brooks, had developed a way to harvest oyster gametes, but the resulting oyster larvae starved to death before they grew large enough to be filtered out of the water.[5] Because they were so small, any attempt to change the water (thus providing new food) would remove the larvae too.[6] Wells's innovation was to use the clarifier to concentrate the larvae. He used Brooks' method to acquire gametes, and grew them to adulthood in clarified seawater. By adding fresh seawater each day, and then using the clarifier to concentrate the larvae, Wells was able to resupply their food without losing them.[4]/nWith this technique, Wells was the first to successfully cultivate Mercenaria mercenaria clams in captivity. Wells also cultivated the oyster Crassostrea virginica, the mussel Mytilus edulis, the clams Mya arenaria and Spisula solidissima, and the scallop Argopecten irradians.[4]/nOther work on oysters included oyster purification with chlorination.[1]/nBeginning in the 1930s, Wells' research examined respiratory disease transmission. German bacteriologist Carl Fl\u00fcgge in 1899 was the first to show that microorganisms in droplets expelled from the respiratory tract are a means of disease transmission. The term Fl\u00fcgge droplet was sometimes used for particles that are large enough to not completely dry out.[7] Fl\u00fcgge's concept of droplets as primary source and vector for respiratory transmission of diseases prevailed into the 1930s until Wells differentiated between large and small droplets.[8][9] Wells' major contribution was to show that the nuclei of evaporated droplets can remain in the air for long enough for others to breathe them in and become infected.[10] He and his wife developed the Wells curve, which describes how the size of respiratory droplets influences their fate and thus their ability to transmit disease.[3][11] With Richard L. Riley, he also developed the Wells-Riley equation \"to express the mass balance of transmission factors under steady state conditions.\"[12]/nIn 1935, Wells demonstrated that ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), which had been used to kill microorganisms on surfaces and in liquids, could also be used to kill airborne infectious organisms. This experiment proved that he had been correct that droplet nuclei could be infectious, and also suggested a route for prevention. In 1935, Wells helped develop UVGI barriers for the Infants' and Children's Hospital in Boston, using cubicle-like rooms subjected to high-intensity UV light to reduce cross-contamination. From 1937 to 1941, Wells implemented a long-term study using upper-room UVGI, that is, UVGI which only sterilized the area above people's heads, allowing the room to be occupied at the time but relying on vertical ventilation to ensure the occupants breathe sterilized air. This study installed upper-room UVGI in suburban Philadelphia schools to prevent the spread of measles.[10]/nWells first proposed the idea of airborne droplet nucleus transmission of tuberculosis in the 1930s. He demonstrated that rabbits could be infected with bovine TB through droplets.[2] In 1954, Wells began a long-term experiment to demonstrate that tuberculosis could be transmitted through air. At the VA Hospital in Baltimore, collaborating with Riley, John Barnwell, and Cretyl C. Mills, he built a chamber for 150 guinea pigs to be exposed to air from infectious patients in a nearby TB ward. After two years, they found that an average of three guinea pigs a month were indeed infected. Although this was exactly the rate Wells had predicted, skeptics complained that other methods of transmission (such as the animals' food and water) had not been conclusively ruled out. A second long-term study was begun, this time with a second chamber for an additional 150 guinea pigs, whose air was sterilized with UVGI. The animals in the second room did not become ill, proving that the only transmission vector in the first room was the air from the tuberculosis ward. The study was completed in 1961, and published in 1962, though Wells did not see the final paper.[2]/nWells' 1955 book Air Contagion and Air Hygiene has been described as the authoritative book on the subject and a \"landmark monograph on air hygiene.\"[10] It drew on 23 years of research.[1]/nA major area of scientific inquiry during the COVID-19 pandemic was the disease's method of transmission, and especially the distinction between \"droplet\" transmission or \"airborne\" transmission, since different public health measures would be required depending on the transmission vector. Wells' work on droplet size and the airborne transmission of tuberculosis has been cited as important and influential research to support the identification of COVID-19 as airborne, even when particles exceeded 5 microns in size.[3][13]", "54601851": "Lorenzo Galluzzi (born 1980) is an Italian and French cell biologist best known for his experimental and conceptual contributions to the fields of cell death, autophagy, tumor metabolism and tumor immunology./nGalluzzi (born September 26, 1980) is currently assistant professor of Cell Biology in Radiation Oncology at the Department of Radiation Oncology of the Weill Cornell Medical College (New York, USA) and Assistant Professor Adjunct at the Department of Dermatology of the Yale University School of Medicine (New Haven, USA).[1] Prior to joining Weill Cornell Medical College (2017), Galluzzi was a Junior Scientist of the Research Team \"Apoptosis, Cancer and Immunity\" at the Cordeliers Research Center (Paris, France; 2012\u20132016) under the direction of Dr. Guido Kroemer.

Though an autodidact without formal scientific training, Laskey  made many original contributions to the field of ornithology and published in reputable scientific journals.  Many publications refer to her as Mrs F.C. Laskey.[1]/nOver the course of Laskey's career, her investigations included bird breeding behavior, nesting habits, territoriality, longevity, and migration.[1] She was a regular participant in the National Audubon Society's Christmas Bird Count.[2] Her scientific publications spanned 40 years, from 1933 to 1973, the year of her death, and included over 150 papers in ornithological journals. She banded 3,734 birds of 69 species. Laskey was also known for her rehabilitation of wounded birds.[1][2]/nLaskey was born Amelia Rudolph to German immigrant parents, Susan and Frank Rudolph, in Bloomington, Indiana. Her father owned a construction business, and her mother was an avid gardener. She attended school in Chicago through high school. She then became a stenographer at the Oliver Typewriter Company before her marriage to Fredrick C. Laskey in 1911.[1] She also taught girls at the Sunday school of the Ogden Park Methodist Church. In 1921, she and her husband moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where Fredrick worked as a manager at the Swift and Company. The couple did not have children.[3]/nLaskey's research career began following her 1921 move to Nashville, Tennessee. At that time, Laskey began to participate in a local gardening club, having an expansive garden at her home which she named \"Blossomdell\". Her garden provided natural territory for birds and other wild creatures. She also became a member of a local literary society. Through acquaintanceships in these organizations, Laskey joined the Tennessee Ornithological Society in 1928, from which she developed deep interest in ornithology.[1]/nLaskey's initial investigations began with the migratory behavior of chimney swifts, cowbirds, and mockingbirds, species that are common in her locale. For this purpose, she obtained a bird banding license from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Laskey then commenced systematic investigations of bird behavior and migration. She continued to use bird-banding methods for the duration of her scientific career.[2]/nAmong her early investigations, Laskey discovered that chimney swifts wintered in Peru. She determined early in her investigations that, while field sparrows are year-round residents of Tennessee, the winter population is different than the summer population of field sparrows. Laskey also studied bluebird nesting behavior and was the first to identify a Gambel's sparrow, a rare subspecies in Tennessee. Other rare species in Tennessee she observed were the Bicknell's thrush, the tree sparrow, and the Harris' sparrow.[2]/nShe was particularly noted for her study of mockingbird behavior; Laskey investigated the species' song development, mating behavior, number of mates, their egg clutch sizes, and territorial defense. She also discovered that brown-headed cowbirds were monogamous.[1]/nOne of Laskey's scientific methods was direct and prolonged observation of the behavior of specific individuals of a bird species. In this regard, Laskey kept a mockingbird named Honey child at her home for 15 years. Her study of this captive bird complemented her systematic studies of mockingbird behaviour, including song acquisition by mockingbirds.[4][5]/nOther birds that Laskey rehabilitated included a crippled red-tailed hawk which lived with her for another ten years and an albino great horned owl that she boarded for 22 years. She began bird banding in 1931 and became a very careful and prolific bander. She also contributed to Lowery and Newman's study of nocturnal bird migration[6] through the observation of flocks of birds as their silhouettes crossed the disc of the moon.[3]/nBeginning in 1948, Laskey became aware that many birds were dying for then unknown reasons at the Nashville Airport and at other airports.[7] In her investigation of the airport bird fatalities, she discovered that birds were disoriented by a type of light used in ceilometers for cloud detection, especially during migratory periods. Laskey found that the bird fatalities could be avoided by use of suitably filtered light. United States government aviation authorities mandated use of such filters, thereby solving the problem of bird fatalities caused by ceilometer usage.[3][8] Laskey was also a pioneer researcher of migratory bird casualties at television towers.[3]/nEarly in her scientific investigations, Laskey corresponded with professional ornithologist Margaret Morse Nice, who mentored Laskey and encouraged her to publish in scientific ornithological journals.

At the age of ten, he attended the college of Brives, where he showed great aptitude for study, but his independence of spirit was so great that he was almost constantly in a state of rebellion against his teachers and was finally expelled. He was then taken to Paris by his father and left to carry on his studies at his own discretion for two years. From 1773 to 1775 he travelled in Poland and Germany, and on his return to Paris he devoted himself mainly to poetry. About this time he sent to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise a translation of the passage from Homer proposed for their prize, and, though he did not win, he received so much encouragement from his friends that he contemplated translating the whole of the Iliad.[5]/nAt his father's wish, he gave up writing and decided to engage in a more settled profession,  selecting medicine. In 1789 his Observations sur les h\u00f4pitaux (Observations on hospitals, 1790) procured him an appointment as administrator of hospitals in Paris, and in 1795 he became professor of hygiene at the medical school of Paris, a post which he exchanged for the chair of legal medicine and the history of medicine in 1799.[6]/nPartly because of his poor health, he tended not to practise as a physician, his interests lying in the deeper problems of medical and physiological science. During the last two years of Honor\u00e9 Mirabeau's life, Cabanis was intimately connected with him; Cabanis wrote the four papers on public education which were found among Mirabeau's papers at his death (and Cabanis edited them soon afterwards in 1791). During the illness which terminated his life Mirabeau trusted entirely to Cabanis' professional skills. Of the death of Mirabeau, Cabanis drew up a detailed narrative, intended as a justification of his treatment of the case. He was enthusiastic about the French Revolution and became a member of the Council of Five Hundred and then of the Senate, and the dissolution of the Directory was the result of a motion which he made to that effect. His political career was brief. Hostile to the policy of Napoleon Bonaparte, he rejected every offer of a place under his government. He died at Meulan.[6]/nHis body is buried in the Pantheon and his heart in Auteuil Cemetery in Paris.[7]/nA complete edition of Cabanis's works was begun in 1825, and five volumes were published. His principal work, Rapports du physique et du moral de l'homme (On the relations between the physical and moral aspects of man, 1802), consists in part of memoirs, read in 1796 and 1797 to the institute, and is a sketch of physiological psychology. Psychology is with Cabanis directly linked on to biology, for sensibility, the fundamental fact, is the highest grade of life and the lowest of intelligence. All the intellectual processes are evolved from sensibility, and sensibility itself is a property of the nervous system. The soul is not an entity, but a faculty; thought is the function of the brain. Just as the stomach and intestines receive food and digest it, so the brain receives impressions, digests them, and has as its organic secretion, thought.[6]/nAlongside this materialism, Cabanis held another principle. He belonged in biology to the vitalistic school of G.E. Stahl, and in the posthumous work, Lettre sur les causes premi\u00e8res (1824), the consequences of this opinion became clear. Life is something added to the organism: over and above the universally diffused sensibility there is some living and productive power to which we give the name of Nature. It is impossible to avoid ascribing both intelligence and will to this power. This living power constitutes the ego, which is truly immaterial and immortal. Cabanis did not think that these results were out of harmony with his earlier theory.[6]/nHis work was highly appreciated by the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, who called his work \"excellent\".[8]/nHe was a member of the masonic lodge Les Neuf S\u0153urs from 1778.[citation needed] In 1786, Cabanis was elected an international member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia.[9]/nCabanis was an early proponent of evolution.[10][11] In the Encyclopedia of Philosophy it is stated that he \"believed in spontaneous generation. Species have evolved through chance mutations (\"fortuitous changes\") and planned mutation (\"man's experimental attempts\") which change the structures of heredity.\"[12]/nHe influenced the work of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who referred to Cabanis in his Philosophie Zoologique.[11][13] Cabanis was an advocate of the inheritance of acquired characteristics; he also developed his own theory of instinct.[11]/nCabanis made a statement that recognized a basic understanding of natural selection. Historian Martin S. Staum has written that:/nIn a simple statement of adaptation and selection theory, Cabanis argued that species that have escaped extinction \"have had successively to bend and conform to sequences of circumstances, from which apparently were born, in each particular circumstance, other entirely new species, better adjusted to the new order of things.\"[10]", "31762659": "Steven Elliot Brenner is a professor at the Department of Plant and Microbial Biology at the University of California Berkeley, adjunct professor at the Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences at the University of California, and San Francisco\nFaculty scientist, Physical Biosciences at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.[2][3][4]/nBrenner gained his Bachelor of Arts in 1992 from Harvard University and Doctor of Philosophy in 1997 from the University of Cambridge for research supervised by Cyrus Chothia.[5][6] He was one of the creators of the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database[7] while working at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) in Cambridge, UK./nAs of 2017[update] research in Brenner's laboratory investigates:/nIn 2010 he was awarded the Overton Prize from the International Society for Computational Biology.[1][8]", "50571493": "William Whigham Fletcher FRSE FLS (11 August 1918 \u2013 4 April 2001) was a Scottish biologist and academic author.

Cashmore (b. 22 Jan 1941)[2] is a biochemist and plant molecular biologist, best known for identifying cryptochrome photoreceptor proteins.[1][3][4][5]  These specialized proteins are critical for plant development and play an essential role in circadian rhythms of plants and animals.[4][5][6][7] A Professor emeritus in the Department of Biology at the University of Pennsylvania, Cashmore led the Plant Science Institute from the time of his appointment in 1986 until his retirement in 2011.[8] He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2003.[9]/nBorn in Auckland (New Zealand) in 1941, Cashmore grew up in Manawaru and Te Aroha. As a teenager, Cashmore worked in Palmerston North in the Grasslands Division of New Zealand's Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR).[10]/nCashmore enrolled at the University of Auckland, majoring in chemistry and completing a Bachelor of Science degree in 1962, Master of Science degree in 1963, and Ph.D. degree in 1966.[2] In 1968 Cashmore moved to Cambridge (UK) to pursue postdoctoral studies at the University of Cambridge Department of Chemistry, and later at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology.[2][9] In 1971 Cashmore moved to the United States, where he worked as a Research Associate in the laboratory of Michael Chamberlin at the University of California, Berkeley before returning to New Zealand.[2][9]/nIn 1979, Cashmore took a position at the Rockefeller University (New York), first as a visiting scientist in the laboratory of Nam-Hai Chua, and then as an assistant professor, then Associate Professor.[11] In 1986, Cashmore was appointed the Director of the Plant Science Institute at the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia).[4][2] He retired in 2011 and is currently an Emeritus Professor of Biology at the University of Pennsylvania.[8]/nDuring his PhD studies, Cashmore purified the toxic component of Pimelea prostrata, a New Zealand toxic shrub.[10] Using partition chromatography, Cashmore purified and crystallized the active component, referred to as prostratin. Cashmore's studies showed that prostratin was strikingly similar to the co-carcinogenic phorbol esters of croton oil, a relationship that was subsequently confirmed using chemical synthesis[12] and x-ray crystallography approaches.[13]/nWorking with George Petersen (a New Zealand biochemist) at New Zealand's Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) (Palmerston North), Cashmore was introduced to the study of nucleic acids and how selective chemical reagents could be used to determine the nucleic acid sequence of DNA.[10] Cashmore and Petersen examined the use of hydrazine as a tool to measure purine nucleotides in samples of DNA.[14][15]  Recognizing that hydrazine-treated DNA subsequently exposed to alkali conditions undergoes degradation, Cashmore defined a quantitative technique for measuring purine nucleotides in DNA samples.[14] Subsequently, Allan Maxam and Walter Gilbert employed the hydrazine degradation approach to develop Maxam\u2013Gilbert sequencing, the first widely adopted method for DNA sequencing.[16]/nWorking with Dan Brown[17] at Cambridge University, Cashmore demonstrated that the reagent methoxyamine reacted with a limited number of cytosine residues in tRNA. Later, Cashmore used the RNA sequencing procedure that had recently been developed by Fred Sanger to identify the reactive cytosine residues in a tyrosine suppressor tRNA of Escherichia coli.[18] Studying a mutant of this tRNA, Cashmore identified a new reactive cytosine residue at the base of loop III.[19] This finding suggested that base pairing of conserved residues occurred supporting one of the early models proposed for the three dimensional structure of transfer RNA.[20]/nRibulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), thought to be the world's most abundant protein,[21] utilizes photosynthetic energy to fix carbon dioxide through the conversion of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate to two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate. It is an enzyme of interest in the field of climate change due to its role in fixing carbon dioxide.[22][23] At New Zealand's DSIR Palmerston North,[24] Cashmore studied the biosynthesis of RuBisCO, a multi-subunit (eight large and eight small subunits) protein located in plant chloroplasts. Using selective inhibitors of protein synthesis Cashmore showed that in contrast to the RuBisCO large subunit (which was known to be synthesized on chloroplast ribosomes), the small subunit of RuBisCO was produced as a soluble precursor protein on cytoplasmic ribosomes.[25] The soluble precursor protein is subsequently processed and imported into chloroplasts.[26][27]/nAt Rockefeller University, Cashmore studied DNA sequences associated with light regulated expression of a pea nuclear RuBisCO small subunit gene.[28] For these studies, Cashmore collaborated with scientists in the laboratory of Jeff Schell and Marc Van Montagu in Ghent (Belgium).[29] Using transgenic plant cells, they demonstrated that in the pea plant, light-regulated expression was mediated by a 1 kilobase (kb) promoter fragment.[28] In a second study, this DNA fragment was shown to have the properties of an enhancer sequence, functioning in either orientation and when fused to a normally non-light-regulated promoter.[30]/nIn 1881, Francis Darwin and Charles Darwin demonstrated that plants exhibited a phototropic response to blue light.[31][32][33] Elusive to discovery, scientists gave the name cryptochrome to the photoreceptor factor(s) responsible for this effect.[34] Interested in adopting the \"power of Arabidopsis genetics\" for the study of light regulation,[7] in 1980 Cashmore, working with post-doctoral student Margaret Ahmad, identified Arabidopsis mutants that showed reduced sensitivity to blue light. Using DNA sequencing and complementation techniques, Cashmore and Ahmed cloned the gene and discovered that the mutants were alleles of a previously identified hy4 mutant.[5] Ahmad and Cashmore called this blue light photoreceptor \"cryptochrome\", and it is now referred to as CRY1.[5][35] Cashmore's research group identified a second member of the cryptochrome family (CRY2) using cDNA library screening.[4] This research was the foundation that led to the identification of CRY proteins in other plant species, bacteria, fungi, animals, and humans, as well as research that defined the pivotal role of these proteins in circadian clock regulation across species[7][36] and as the primary sensory molecule enabling light-dependent magnetic compass orientation in migratory birds.[37] Today, light-based diagnostic and therapeutic wearable photonic healthcare devices, are based on the function of the cryptochrome photoreceptors.[38]/nIn recent years, Cashmore turned his attention to the topic of human behavior, studying the concepts of free will and consciousness. In a publication on this topic,[39] Cashmore noted that in popular discussions regarding the relative importance of nature vs nurture, an element that is commonly missing is awareness that individuals are responsible for neither their genetic inheritance nor their environment.[39] Based on this observation, he therefore asked \"where does this notion of free will come from?\" and challenged the scientific community to reconsider the concept of free will.[39][40]/nApplying the scientific method to probe the concept from a Philosophy of Information approach, Cashmore argued that all biological systems \u2013 including humans \u2013 obey the laws of chemistry and physics. Cashmore further suggested that the concept of free will  \"is an illusion, akin to religious beliefs or the outdated belief in vitalism\", equivalent to the continuing belief in Cartesian duality, and therefore contradictory to society's interpretation of accountability in the criminal justice system.[39][41][42] The article stimulated discussion and analysis by scientists in the fields of biology, behavioral sciences, and philosophy.[43] Scientist and author Jerry Coyne stated that after reading this article on determinism and the criminal justice system, he was \u2018instantly converted to determinism\u2019.[44][45][46]/nCashmore was a Professor of Biology at the University of Pennsylvania and Director of the Plant Science Institute there until his retirement in 2011.[9] Since 2011, he has been a Professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania (Department of Biology).[9] Cashmore has authored more than 100 refereed research papers and has served on the editorial boards of the publications Plant Molecular Biology, The Plant Journal, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.[9][47] He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2003.[9][48]/nCashmore was born in Auckland (New Zealand), to parents Nancy and Norman Cashmore.[50] He is married to American Neuroscientist and Geneticist Nancy Bonini.[51]/n\u2022\tGoogle Scholar - Anthony R.

She was the second woman to be appointed as full professor at the University of the West Indies (UWI). She was the first woman appointed as a professor in the Faculty of Medicine in 1983, ten years after she was appointed as head of UWI's Microbiology Department. A specialist in infectious disease and viral epidemiology, she advised numerous national, regional and international departments and governmental agencies on such diseases as dengue, influenza, and typhoid. In 1998, she was honored as a Commander of the Order of Distinction./nSheila Dorothy King, known as Dorothy,[1] was born in 1932, in Barbados to Henrietta Adina (n\u00e9e Stuart) and Alfred T. King.[2][3] She grew up in Barbados and completed her secondary education at Queen's College in Bridgetown, before enrolling in medical school at the University College of the West Indies in Mona, Jamaica.[3] In 1958, King graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery[4][5] and on the day of her graduation became engaged to fellow medical student, Hugh Hastings Wynter. The two were assigned to complete their internship at the University College Hospital in the obstetrics and gynecology department. On 28 December 1959, at the chapel on the UWI campus, King and Wynter married.[1]/nOver the next four years, King worked in various rotations including as Casualty Officer, House Officer in Medicine, House Officer of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Senior House Officer in Paediatrics at the University College Hospital, and she had two sons, Shaun and David.[1][5] In 1961, she was appointed as an assistant Lecturer in the Department of Microbiology at UWI.[5] That same year, leaving her children in Jamaica with their grandparents,[1] King relocated to England and enrolled in post-graduate studies at the University of London. She graduated with her Postgraduate Diploma in bacteriology in 1964 and went on to earn her Membership in the Royal College of Pathology at the University of London,[5] before returning home to resume her post at UWI.[1]/nBesides her teaching, King conducted research on viral diseases. In 1968, she was involved in a vaccine study to inoculate Jamaican school children at risk for the rubella virus with a weakened strain of live virus.[6] In 1970, King was granted tenure and three years later she was made Head of the Department of Microbiology. Simultaneously, in 1973, she began working as the supervisor for the Ministry of Health's Typhoid Carrier Surveillance Programme. The following year she was appointed to the advisory board of the Trinidad Virus Laboratory and became an advisor to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)'s Committee on Dengue in the Americas.[5] In 1977, a dengue epidemic swept through Jamaica, soon spreading throughout the Caribbean and to the American mainland.[7] King and Dr. Esmie Rose, who headed the Virology Department directed the investigation to identify the virus and develop a plan to control the virus. Their findings were presented at a conference held in Montego Bay 8\u201311 May 1978.[8]/nKing also made studies of the rotavirus and the role they played in the development of gastroenteritis,[9] typhoid, meningitis, and Hepatitis B and was a prolific publisher and presenter at international conferences on regional infectious disease.[5][10] From 1981, had additional responsibilities as Director of the Jamaican Influenza Center for the WHO and on the advisory board for the Caribbean Epidemiological Center (CAREC).[5][2] In 1983, after a decade heading the Department of Microbiology, and earning her Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of London, King was made a full professor. The appointment was only the second full professorship ever granted to a woman in UWI's history and was the first time a woman had been elevated to the position in the faculty of medicine.[5][11]  To recognize her achievement, King was awarded the Medal of Appreciation by the Prime Minister that same year.[2][3] In 1998, she was honored by the government of Jamaica as a Commander in the Order of Distinction[12] and that same year conducted research into a virulent strain of the influenza virus which was prevalent on the island.[13] King retired from UWI in 2001.[14]", "40773905": "Margaret Scott Robinson (born 1951)[1] FRS FMedSci is a British molecular cell biologist, a professor and researcher in the Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, at the University of Cambridge.[2]/nRobinson received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Biology from Smith College in Massachusetts.[3] She completed her PhD at Harvard University supervised by David Albertini and also Barbara Pearse.[4][5] In 2003 she was appointed Professor of Molecular Cell Biology at the Cambridge Institute for Medical Research[6] and is conducting research on coated vesicle proteins.[3]/nMargaret Robinson was first exposed about science early in her life from reading about Marie Curie. While enrolled at Smith College, she planned on being an English or theater major. However, due to university requirements, Margaret had to complete an introductory biology course. In that course, Jeanne Powell gave a lecture on cells and showed her students electron micrographs.[5] This is when Margaret really became interested in cellular biology; the complexity of cells intrigued her./nAfter receiving her undergraduate degree, Robinson took a year off and ended up at Harvard Medical School.[5]/nRobinson eventually joined a new lab and was able to conduct research on anything she liked. Due to her inexperience, her research did not go as planned and was nearly kicked out of graduate school.[5] Robinson had to stop working on her interest in coated vesicles and work on something closer to what the lab was researching./nRobinson eventually started a postdoctoral research with Barbara Pearse,[5] joining her at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in December 1982.[7] Her interest was in  clathrin-coated vesicles that binds to cargo. She eventually succeeded in purifying components of the coat that were not clathrin and are now known as adaptor proteins.[5] These proteins sit between clathrin, which forms the vesicle\u2019s outer shell and also the vesicle membrane. Continuing, Margaret discovered that there were two different populations of  clathrin-coated vesicles, one that uses AP-2 at the plasma membrane and one that uses AP-1 and was associated with intracellular membranes.[5] AP-1 and AP-2 are both heterotetramers with related subunits. They both have two large subunits and the other subunit is closely related in AP-1 and AP-2./nHer achievements include the discovery of adaptins, which are specific proteins that manage cell-trafficking to ensure the correct cell cargo is transported to the right location.[2] She also discovered different combinations of adapting, when together with clathrin, form a coat around vesicles that bud from intracellular membranes and act as transporters for protein packages to be distributed in the cell. She also developed the technique \u201cknock sideways,\u201d which inactivates proteins in seconds.[8]/nAfter finishing her postdoc, she was able to start her own lab. Her main focus was to learn more about the AP protein in depth.[5] She had to also work with DNA because in order to characterize the complexes thoroughly, she needed to clone the subunits. Robinson and her lab managed to find another AP complex, AP-3, which interacts with lysosomal membrane proteins such as LAMP1.[5] AP-3 also interacts with tyrosinase, which is a key enzyme in melanin biosynthesis, so AP-3 is important for tyrosinase trafficking to premelanosomes.[5]/nAs of 2016[update] Robinson has a lab at Cambridge Institute for Medical Research.[8] She specifically works with coated vesicles. The best-characterized coated vesicles are the  clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). The coats on CCVs are primarily of clathrin, adaptor protein (AP) complexes, and alternative adaptors. Her working hypothesis is that for each trafficking pathway, there are a number of different adaptors, each of which is recruited independently onto the appropriate membrane.[8] Once on the membrane, the various adaptors would work together to package different types of cargo into the newly forming vesicle. Robinson and her researchers use several approaches to look for novel adaptors and other components of the trafficking machinery, including proteomic analyses of sub cellular fractions, genome-wide siRNA library screening,  insertional mutagenesis, and a new method they developed for rapidly inactivating proteins, called \u2018knock sideways\u2019.[2] Her current projects include establishing the functions of AP-1 and other adaptors in differentiated cells; matching up machinery and cargo proteins; investigating how clathrin and adaptors are hijacked by the  HIV-1-encoded protein Nef; determine why mutations in the non-clathrin adaptors AP-4 and AP-5 cause hereditary spastic paraplegia; and exploring the evolution of adaptors.[9] \nHer laboratory uses many techniques including immunolocalisation at the light and electron microscope levels, sub cellular fractionation, protein purification, proteomics, flow cytometry, live cell imaging, and X-ray crystallography./nEvery form of eukaryotic life on earth contains coated vesicles and adaptors. Her work is also speculated to play a key role in evolution of eukaryotes form prokaryotes over two billion years ago. Her work also has medical implications. Some adaptors are mutated in certain genetic disorders, and adaptors are frequently exploited by pathogens . For example, the HIV genome encodes a protein called Nef, which is required for the development of AIDS, and which works by hijacking adaptors and using them to modify the surface of the infected cell./nRobinson\u2019s work explains how coated vesicles sort cargo but also provides tools that can be used by others to address their own favorite problems. For instance, her newly developed method called knocksideways. Knocksideways gets rid of proteins rapidly. Her technique has found its way into other labs who are also interested in how particular proteins contribute to different stages of cell division.[9]/nRobinson has received many honors working as a cellular biologist. She was awarded a Wellcome Trust Principal Research Fellowship in 1999 and in 2003 she was appointed Professor of Molecular Cell Biology.[3] She was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences[when?] and member of the European Molecular Biology Organization.[when?] She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2012.[2] The Wellcome Trust also has funded her research for over 25 years.[9]", "67447064": "Cayetano Heredia University (Degree in Marine Biology)/nWhitley Gold Award\nPew Fellowship in Marine Conservation/nPatricia Majluf Chiok is a Peruvian biologist, zoologist, researcher and conservationist.

While in high school, she also participated in civil rights marches and heard Martin Luther King Jr. speak in Louisville.[1]\nShe graduated from Seneca High School in Louisville in 1962.[10]/nShe earned her Bachelor of Arts degree from Oberlin College in 1966, majoring in chemistry.[3] After graduation, she spent a summer as an Appalachian Volunteer, working as a community organizer in Wolfe County, Kentucky, as part of Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty.[1]/nShe was accepted into the Biology Department at Stanford. She took classes in plant physiology with Winslow Briggs, worked in his laboratory, and transferred to Harvard when Briggs took a professorship there. In 1968 she married Allan J. Tobin. They spent a year at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, where Elaine Tobin worked with plant geneticist Ezra Galun.[1] After returning to North America, she completed her Ph.D. in Biology at Harvard University in 1972.[3] She later married J. Philip Thornber.[2]/nIn 1973 Tobin went to Brandeis University, where she did postdoctoral work with Attila Klein, on the influence of light on the development of plants. \nIn 1975 she was hired in the Biology Department at  University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Support was sparse, but she was able to get funding for basic research on plants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). She was able to obtain laboratory space previously used by retiring professor Karl Hamner.[11]/nAs a student with Winslow Briggs, Tobin had been introduced to the effects of phytochrome on flowering and to the work of Karl Hamner on circadian rhythms and flowering.[1] \nCircadian rhythms in plants help them to coordinate with external light/dark cycles.  Anticipating dawn, dusk, and seasonal day length allows plants to more effectively regulate both daily and seasonal activities, including the movement of leaves and petals, the opening of stomata for photosynthesis, stem growth, and the development of flowers.[12]/nTobin first used  Lemna gibba (duckweed) and later Arabidopsis thaliana (cress) as model plant systems to study light regulation of gene expression in plants, examining interactions between phytochrome photoreceptors, genes, and circadian rhythms.[13]\nTobin was able to isolate poly(A) RNA from duckweed, expose slab gels to x-ray film, and show that while some mRNAs decreased in light, others increased.[13]/nIn 1984, postdoctoral student Jane Silverthorne and Tobin demonstrated that photoreceptors in plants could affect the transcription of specific genes. Light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding (LHCB) protein sequences from Lemna gibba were low in darkness but could be rapidly and reversibly restored by light exposure.[13]\nTobin's group also demonstrated phytochrome regulation of LHCB proteins (also known as cab genes) in Arabidopsis.[13][14][15]\nBy growing duckweed heterotrophically in the dark, and exposing it briefly to red and far-red light, Tobin demonstrated the effects of phytochromes on plant growth and transcription in rcbs genes.[16]/nIn a series of experiments beginning in 1993, Tobin's lab described DNA-binding activity with an affinity for LHCB in plant cells. Using a DNA fragment, they screened the Arabidopsis expression library, and cloned a protein with relevant binding activity, which they named CCA1. They showed that Circadian Clock Associated 1 (CCA1) was necessary for phytochrome response  in Arabidopsis thaliana.[8]\nReports on the activity of CCA1 and a closely related gene (LHY) from George Coupland were submitted together to Cell in 1998.[1] The two genes were the first two components of the circadian clock or central oscillator mechanism in plants to be identified.[6][7] Among many other studies of the regulation and function of CCA1, Tobin has determined that one method of clock regulation involves the phosphorylation of CCA1 by the protein kinase CK2.[17]/nElaine M.

This research was conducted at the University of Massachusetts Medical School and published in 1998. Mello has been a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator since 2000.[1]/nMello was born in New Haven, Connecticut on October 18, 1960.[2] He was the third child of James and Sally Mello. His father, James Mello, was a paleontologist and his mother, Sally Mello, was an artist.[2] His paternal grandparents immigrated to the US from the Portuguese islands of Azores. His parents met while attending Brown University and were the first children in their respective families to attend college. His grandparents on both sides withdrew from school as teenagers to work for their families.[2] James Mello completed his Ph.D. in paleontology from Yale University in 1962. The Mello family moved to Falls Church in northern Virginia so that James could take a position with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in Washington, DC.[2] He was raised as Roman Catholic.[2]/nAfter a brief stay in Falls Church, the family moved to Fairfax, Virginia, when James Mello switched from the USGS to a position as assistant director at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History.[2] Among Craig's fondest early memories were field trips with his father and the whole family to Colorado and Wyoming and more frequent trips to the Blue Ridge mountains in Virginia.[2]/nThe Mello family had a very strong tradition of discussions around the dinner table and this experience was very important to young Mello. He learned to argue, to listen, and to admit it when he was wrong about something. At a time when young Mello was not performing so well in school, these daily discussions helped to build his confidence and self-esteem.[2] Mello struggled during the first few years of grade school. He started first grade at the age of five in a local private school because he was too young to enter first grade in the public system. He doesn't know if he was a slow learner, or just not interested, but he did not do well in school until the seventh grade. In second grade, Mello only pretended that he could read and he was embarrassed by being called on in class.[2] He much preferred playing outdoors, in the woods and creeks, to time spent in the classroom.[2] Meanwhile, his older siblings were model students, raising the teacher's expectations for him. During these early years, Mello had no doubt that he would be a scientist when he grew up.  He is now the father of two daughters and a step-daughter and step-son.[2]/nMello attended Fairfax High School (Fairfax, Virginia).[2] After receiving his high school diploma, Mello attended Brown University as a biochemistry and molecular biology major.

He was a postdoctoral fellow at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in the laboratory of James Priess.[2]/nIn 2006, Mello and Fire received the Nobel Prize for work that began in 1998, when Mello and Fire along with their colleagues (SiQun Xu, Mary Montgomery, Stephen Kostas, and Sam Driver) published a paper [4] in the journal Nature detailing how tiny snippets of RNA fool the cell into destroying the gene's messenger RNA (mRNA) before it can produce a protein - effectively shutting specific genes down./nIn the annual Howard Hughes Medical Institute Scientific Meeting held on November 13, 2006 in Ashburn, Virginia, Mello recounted the phone call that he received announcing that he had won the prize. He recalls that it was shortly after 4:30 am and he had just finished checking on his daughter, and returned to his bedroom. The phone rang (or rather the green light was blinking) and his wife told him not to answer, as it was a prank call. Upon questioning his wife, she revealed that it had rung while he was out of the room and someone was playing a bad joke on them by saying that he had won the Nobel prize. When he told her that they were actually announcing the Nobel prize winners on this very day, he said \"her jaw dropped.\" He answered the phone, and the voice on the other end told him to get dressed, and that in half an hour his life was about to change./nThe Nobel citation, issued by Sweden's Karolinska Institute, said: \"This year's Nobel Laureates have discovered a fundamental mechanism for controlling the flow of genetic information.\"/nMello and Fire's research, conducted at the Carnegie Institution for Science (Fire) and the University of Massachusetts Medical School (Mello), had shown that in fact RNA plays a key role in gene regulation.

Hand (born February 4, 1940) is an American evolutionary biologist, animal behaviorist (ethologist) and a novelist. She writes on a variety of topics related to the science of animal and human behavior, including the biological and evolutionary roots of war, gender differences in conflict resolution, the empowerment of women, and the steps for ending war./nHer book, Women, Power, and the Biology of Peace[1] is an in-depth exploration of human gender differences with regard to aggression. Her book, Shift:The Beginning of War, The Ending of War[2] is an in-depth exploration of the origins of war, causes of war, human gender differences with regard to war, and possible means to end war. Her website, A Future Without War,[3] a book by the same name,[4] and a paper, To Abolish War,[5] are devoted to the concept of and requirements for abolishing war./nHand has been a member of the International Society for Human Ethology (ISHE), since its inception in 1972. ISHE is a professional organization whose members study human behavior and come from such diverse disciplines as biology, anthropology and psychology.  The term \"peace ethology\" was coined by ethologist, Peter Verbeek, as a subdiscipline of human ethology, one that is concerned with issues of human conflict, conflict resolution, reconciliation, war, peacemaking, and peacekeeping behavior.[6]/nFrom 1967 to 1975, Hand taught high school biology at Santa Monica High School in Santa Monica, CA. While still teaching, she began a Ph.D. program at UCLA and in 1979 was awarded a Ph.D. in Animal Behavior, also called Ethology (her subfields were Ornithology and Primatology). Her doctoral dissertation compared vocalizations of two populations of gulls (Larus occidentalis), and the results were used to reclassify the gull population in the Gulf of California as a separate species, (Larus livens), not just a subspecies of Larus occidentalis./nAfter completing her doctorate, she continued behavioral research as a Smithsonian Post-doctoral Fellow at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. (1979\u20131980). This research resulted in published papers on conflict resolution highlighting the use of egalitarian behavior to resolve conflicts. For example, mated gull pairs in conflict over nesting duties or access to choice food used such methods as sharing, first-come-first-served, and negotiation rather than the commonly studied dominance and subordination behavior to resolve conflicts.[7] Female gulls of the species she studied are always smaller than their mates. In her theoretical paper in the Quarterly Review of Biology (Vol. 61, 1986) she used a game theory approach to introduce the concept of \u201cleverage\u201d to explain why smaller individuals are sometimes able to establish an egalitarian relationship with much larger individuals, ones that could easily dominate them physically.[8] This paper also introduced the concept of \u201cspheres of dominance\u201d to explain why, in a given relationship between two individuals, the relative payoffs to survival or reproduction depends on the context of a conflict. Different contexts will provide different payoffs to each individual and consequently determine which individual of the pair will be dominant in a given context, instead of one individual being dominant over the other in all contexts./nFrom 1980 to 1985, she was a Research Associate and Lecturer in the UCLA biology department teaching Animal Behavior and Ornithology. In 1987, she moved from Los Angeles to San Diego and spent several years writing fiction./nIn 2003, however, she returned to ethology and self-published Women, Power, and the Biology of Peace. The book draws from fields as diverse as evolutionary biology, primatology, behavior, ornithology, cultural anthropology, neurophysiology, and history.  Hand has expanded concepts from Women, Power, and the Biology of Peace into essays on her website, A Future Without War.[3]/nHand earned a B.S. degree from Wheaton College, Wheaton, Illinois, in 1961, graduating summa cum laude, having majored in cultural anthropology before switching to zoology. In 1963, she earned an M.A. degree in general physiology at UCLA, after which she briefly worked as a laboratory technician at UCLA's Brain Research Institute. In 1963\u20131964, Hand was a research technician at the Max Planck Institute for Neuropsychiatry in Munich, Germany, where she assisted in brain surgeries designed to evoke vocalizations in squirrel monkeys; she published her first scientific papers on these behavioral experiments.[9][10] From 1965 through 1966, at the Pediatrics Department of the UCLA Medical School, she was head technician in a physiological laboratory studying bilirubin metabolism./nAfter moving from Los Angeles to San Diego in 1987, Hand turned her attention to writing fiction. In 2001, she self-published the novel Voice of the Goddess.[11] In her book Women, Power, and the Biology of Peace, Hand states that she was subsequently drawn back into the subject of war and women while promoting this book. The novel's background is the Minoan Culture which Hand portrays as woman-centered, goddess-worshipping, and without wars of aggression, a view she considers valid but which remains controversial./nIn 2004, two of her novels were published by New York publishing houses, the first, an historical epic set against the background of the Trojan War[12] and the second, a contemporary women's action adventure.[13] More published novels soon followed; all featuring strong heroines struggling in epic conflicts in partnership with equally strong heroes.[14][15][16]/nJudith Leon (n\u00e9e Latta) Hand was born in Cherokee, Oklahoma, the daughter of John Leon Latta & Wanda Hazel Latta (1914\u20131994).

In his eclectic lab, developmental work on the frog coexists with biochemical work on mechanism of ubiquitination, cytoskeleton assembly or signal transduction./nAt Princeton, his early work on microtubules established their unusual molecular assembly from tubulin proteins and identified the first microtubule-stabilizing protein tau,[9] later shown to be a major component of the neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease. In studies at UC San Francisco of the frog embryo as a model system of cell development, Kirschner identified the first inducer of embryonic differentiation, fibroblast growth factor (FGF),[10] an early finding in the field of signal transduction./nKirschner's lab is also known for uncovering basic mechanisms of the cell cycle in eukaryotic cells. Working in Xenopus (frog) egg extracts, Kirschner and Andrew Murray showed that cyclin synthesis drives the cell cycle [11] and, later, that ubiquitin regulates levels of cyclin  by marking the cell-cycle molecule for destruction.[12] His lab discovered and purified many of the components involved in cell cycle progression, including anaphase promoting complex (APC), the complex that ubiquitinates cyclin B.[13]/nA second noted[14] finding was his discovery, with Tim Mitchison, of the dynamic instability of microtubules,[15][16] In mitosis, for example, microtubules form the spindle that separates the chromosomes. The first step in spindle formation is the nucleation of microtubules by microtubule-organizing centers, which then grow in all directions. Microtubules that attach to a chromosome are stabilized and are therefore retained to form part of the spindle. Because of dynamic instability, some individual  microtubules that are not stabilized are at risk of collapse (or \u201ccatastrophe\u201d as Kirschner named it), allowing re-use of the tubulin monomers. This recognition of self-organization in biological systems has been highly influential, and helped shape the view of the cytoplasm as a collection of dynamic molecular machines.[17]/nKirschner is also interested in the evolutionary origins of the vertebrate body plan. Together with John Gerhart, he was instrumental in developing the acorn worm Saccoglossus kowalevskii into a model system[18] that could be used to study the divergence between hemichordates and chordates, and the evolution of  the chordate nervous system.[19][20]/nKirschner is a pioneer in using mathematical approaches to learn about central biological questions.  For example, a model of the Wnt pathway he developed in collaboration with the late Reinhart Heinrich showed that new properties and constraints emerge when the individual biochemical steps are combined into a complete pathway.[21][22] A talk he gave on mathematics and the future of medicine at a retreat for Department Chairs at Harvard Medical School in 2003 inspired the Dean, Joseph B. Martin, to found a new Department,  the Department of Systems Biology, with Kirschner as founding chair.[3] Since then, Kirschner's lab has attracted many students and post-docs from theoretical backgrounds who wish to make the transition into biology.  His lab is now a leader in using mathematical tools to analyze signaling pathways,[23] cell size control,[24] and the selectivity of drugs.[25]/nIn two books co-authored with John Gerhart, Kirschner has described the cellular and developmental underpinnings of the evolution of organisms, and the concept of \"evolvability\".[26] In the most recent book, Kirschner and Gerhart proposed a new theory of \"facilitated variation\" that aims to answer the question:  How can small, random genetic changes be converted into useful changes in complex body parts?

Roosevelt on aspects of biological warfare, brought many scientists into uniform for a top secret, coordinated effort to defend against possible enemy use of biological weapons and to devise a capability to respond in kind to such an attack.

In 1943, Baldwin became the first scientific director of the U.S. Army Biological Warfare Laboratories at Camp Detrick, Maryland.[1]/nBaldwin and other scientists were called in for a secret meeting in Washington. After hearing that Germany and Japan were going to start the use of biological warfare, they were asked if it was possible for the United States to produce a substantial amount of their own biological agents. Baldwin responded with, \"[I]f you could do it in a test tube, you could do it in a 10,000-gallon tank. If you get enough tanks I'm sure you will get tons.\"[2] About a month after the meeting, Baldwin was individually called by Colonel William Kabrich of the Army's Chemical Warfare Service and asked if he would lead the project. Although it only took him a day to say yes, Baldwin went through a lot of thought processing as he assessed the moral ramifications of what he was about to do. What he said to Kabrich was, \"you start out with the idea in war of killing people, and that to me is the immoral part of it. It doesn't make much difference how you kill them.\"[3]/nBaldwin found a site suitable for making the deadly microbes. It had to be close enough to Washington, but not too close. He chose an abandoned airfield in Maryland called Detrick Field, which later became known as Camp Detrick.[4] Next, Baldwin hired a staff, recruiting many who had worked with him at the University of Wisconsin, along with other scientists and military personnel.[5] At the end of the research, Baldwin and his crew had successfully produced a large amount of biological agent to use in warfare.

He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School from 1875 to 1882 and went to study medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical School and matriculated from St John's College, Cambridge, in 1886. He was a Hutchinson Student and Scholar who passed with first class in both parts of the Natural Science Tripos in 1888 and 1889.[2] He took a keen interest in bacteriology and decided against a career in medicine. In 1890 he was elected Hutchinson Student in Pathology and by the end of the year, he was admitted as a Fellow in November. He obtained the degree of MA in 1893 and Sc.D. in 1905 before working under Professor Charles Roy at his Pathological Laboratory in Trinity College London. His early studies in bacteriology included a new staining technique using aniline dyes (1886), some studies on anthrax in collaboration with F.F. Wesbrook, immunity and the role of \"alexins\". He extracted an albumose fraction from anthrax cultures that he claimed suppressed the host immune system. Inoculation of small quantities of this albumose protein made rabbits immune to anthrax.[3] He worked under Robert Koch for some time in Berlin and under Louis Pasteur in Paris before he accepted a position in India as Chemical Examiner, Government Analyst and Bacteriologist for the United Provinces, Punjab and the Central Provinces and was posted at a laboratory in Agra in 1892.[1]/nEven early in his undergraduate years, he gained a reputation for conducting scientific experiments on himself. He was known for overdosing himself with medication and rolling a heated cannonball over himself in an attempt to speed up digestion.[1] While on a beach at Dunwich in 1885, he saved a girl from drowning and the local newspapers hoped that he would be awarded a gallantry medal by the Royal Humane Society.[4] As a bacteriologist he was associated with several others like Emanuel Edward Klein (Charles Smart Roy also worked at the Brown Animal Sanatory Institution) who were involved in a major public debate on vivisection, Hankin was seen by some press reporters as a \"vivisector\" who had \"escaped\" to India.[5]/nArriving in India, Hankin worked on the frequent outbreaks of cholera, challenging the prevalent view that \"miasmas\" were responsible for them. He demonstrated to the public and the officials that micro-organisms were the cause and published his notes and opinions translated into Indian languages.[1] He noted in 1896 that boiling water supplies was a reliable protection against cholera in India. The press which was against his former association with experimenters who had been accused of vivisection noted that this implied that his services as a bacteriologist were not required. A writer Zoophilist states:- \"Remarkable to state, a vivisector has made a beneficial\u2014and common-sense discovery. The discoverer in this case is Mr Hankin an old antagonist of ours, whom we met in debate at Cambridge before he took ship and departed to serve as a bacteriologist in India, where he still remains.\"[5] In 1896 he published, through the Pasteur Institute, \"L'action bactericide des eaux de la Jumna et du Gange sur le vibrion du cholera\",[6] a paper in which he described the antibacterial activity of a then unknown source in the Ganges and Jumna rivers in India. He noted that \"It is seen that the unboiled water of the Ganges kills the cholera germ in less than 3 hours. The same water, when boiled, does not have the same effect. On the other hand, well water is a good medium for this microbe, whether boiled or filtered.\" He suggested that it was responsible for limiting the spread of cholera. While many observers have considered this as evidence of early observations of bacteriophage activity, some of his later experiments raise doubts. Hankin subsequently suggested that the bactericidal action was through a \"volatile\" agent. He further conducted experiments where he showed that Ganges water heated in hermetically sealed containers retained their ability to kill bacterial cultures while open one on heating lost their potency. A 2011 commentator adds that Hankin's initial results suggest extremely high phage counts which seem improbable.[7] It was however not until twenty years later that phage activity was demonstrated without doubt by the experiments of F\u00e9lix d'Herelle later described at the Pasteur Institute.[8][9][10] This observation on the water of the Ganges became quite famous, and even found mention in Mark Twain's More Tramps Abroad.[11]/nHankin was responsible through his letters to officials in prompting the establishment of the Pasteur Institute of India at Kasauli in 1904.[12] One of Hankin's duties as a chemical examiner was to attend to court cases that required the analysis of scientific forensic evidence. He notes that about 700 to 1000 cases of supposed poisoning required tests for poisons to be conducted.[13]/nHankin moved to Bombay following an outbreak of plague in 1905. During this period he took some interest in vultures at the Towers of Silence, which had apparently increased in numbers.[1] Hankin wrote on the Bubonic plague (1899)[14] and \"On the Epidemiology of Plague\" in the Journal of Hygiene in 1905, but his interests also drifted towards the subject of flight, possibly through his observations on vultures. In 1914 he published Animal Flight about soaring flight in birds, based on observations he made, particularly of gulls and vultures, in Agra. He introduced a technique to plot the flight path of soaring birds by tracing their movements on a horizontal mirror. He identified thermals and currents as a requirement for soaring and dynamic soaring.[15][16] His work on soaring birds caught the interest of Cambridge mathematician turned meteorologist Gilbert Walker who was also at Simla who discussed the role and nature of thermals and eddies in providing birds with the lift needed.[17] With D. M. S. Watson, at the time a lecturer in vertebrate palaeontology at University College London, he also published a pioneering paper on the flight of pterodactyls in the Aeronautical Journal (1914).[18]/nHankin studied immune responses with experiments where he injected rabbits with tetanus to induce immunity in them. He took their serum and injected them in rats to demonstrate how the immunity could be transferred.[19] Hankin started the practice of using potassium permanganate in wells as a means for controlling cholera. His theory was that the germs needed organic matter to survive and that permanganate would oxidize it and make it unavailable.[20] In 1895 the press noted that Hankin had been overzealous with his experimentation and had infected himself with cholera by drinking water that he thought had been treated using potassium permanganate.[21] The editors of the journal Science Progress lamented that Hankin had been largely unrecognized for his contributions to human health and hygiene: \"Hankin's work has been of greater importance to India than the work or no-work of many persons who have received more honours and acknowledgements. Really, in some respects the British remain barbarians to the present day, and he should write an article on the mental ability of the Indian Powers-that-Be\u00a0!\"[22] The efficacy of this method of disinfecting wells was however questioned in later studies.[23] When he retired in 1922, he was awarded a Kaisar-i-Hind Medal of the first class.[1]/nDuring the thirty years that he spent in India, Hankin took interest not just in tropical diseases but also the effects of opium and the action of cobra venom, working sometimes in collaboration with Albert Calmette and Waldemar Haffkine. Outside of his health related research he took an interest in such diverse topics as the fauna inhabiting the dome of the Taj Mahal, insect camouflage and its military application,[24] native folklore and art.[1]/nHankin protested the introduction of the 1876 British Act against vivisection into India. He wrote that it came in the way of scientific research and that the legal measures should only be aimed to control cruelty imposed by traditional Indian practices noting that \"so far as Englishmen of science are concerned the prevention of wanton or unnecessary cruelty to animals might safely be left to their good taste and good feeling.\"[25]/nWhile in India, Hankin studied the Islamic geometric patterns that he observed, publishing some of them in 1905.[26] His main findings only found publication from 1925, after his return to the UK, when \"The Drawing of Geometric Patterns in Saracenic Art\" finally appeared in Memoirs of the Archaeological Survey of India, under the editorship of J. F. Blakiston.[27][28][29][30] This and later writings have influenced computer scientists and mathematicians in recent years, notably Craig S. Kaplan.[a][31][32][33]/nHankin returned to England in the early 1920s, living for a while in the Norfolk Broads and spending winters at Torquay or Newquay before finally moving to Brighton. He took a great interest in sailing. He experimented with new designs of sails and methods to combat sea sickness. Together with his old pathologist colleagues include Professor Roy, he built a prototype raft he dubbed The Bacillus, made of kerosene tins and metal rods with an \"umbrella sail\" based on an idea from Percy Pilcher. Unfortunately, the maiden voyage at Colwyn Bay ended with the boat sinking, while the crew had to be rescued by onlookers.[1]/nHe continued his research in the dynamics of animal flight. He was an associate fellow of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain.[34]  In 1923, Time magazine carried a short notice on his exploits: \"Much interest is taken in England in the problems of air gliding. People on a London common saw a strange sight\u2014an elderly gentleman playing with a toy aeroplane. He was Dr. E. H. Hankin\u00a0... and he was experimenting with a model glider.\"[35]/nHankin took a special interest in education and the role of intuition. He believed that modern methods of education tended to damage innate intuition. In 1922 he made a study of Quakers and their education. He calculated, based on statistics for the years between 1851 and 1900, that a man had 46 times greater chance of being elected to the Royal Society if he was a Quaker or of Quaker descent.[36] He attributed this to the superior mental ability that came out of enhancing intuition rather than the development of conscious reasoning that certain educational systems imposed.[37] In 1920, he published a book on the subject The Mental Limitations of the Expert in which he considered examples of where intuition was correct, despite failing rational explanation. He also considered how certain castes in India, such as the money-lending Baniyas, received a training in mental arithmetic that was superior to the system of education imposed by the English in India. He suggested that logical reasoning actually comes in the way of business instinct.[38] He expanded on this work which was published with a foreword by C. S. Myers, co-founder of the British Psychological Society, and titled it Common Sense and its Cultivation (1926). The book was reprinted as recently as 2002 by Routledge. A reviewer compared it with Francis Galton's Inquiry Into Human Faculty.[39]/nIn his 1928 book, The Cave Man's Legacy, Hankin compares the behaviour of apes and primitive man and how they play a role in the life of modern humans.[40] In a later book, he explored the same influences in the outbreaks of violence in his Nationalism and the Communal Mind (1937).[41]/nHankin's publications include:", "73279876": "Irene Wagner-D\u00f6bler is a German microbiologist and associate professor of biology at the Institute of Microbiology, Technical University of Braunschweig.[1]/nIrene Wagner-D\u00f6bler studied biology at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t in Munich and obtained her PhD in 1984 with a thesis in aquatic ecology.[2] In 2001, she obtained her habilitation at the Technical University of Braunschweig. Her habilitation dealt with the detoxification of mercury-containing wastewater using a newly discovered Pseudomonas putida strain and a bioreactor specifically developed for this purpose.[3] For this work she received the \"Stifterverband Science Award - Erwin-Schr\u00f6dinger Preis\"[4] of the Helmholtz-Association of German Research Centers in 2001.[5]/nAs a research group leader at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research (2004-2018) and associate professor at the Technical University Braunschweig (from 2007) AG Wagner-D\u00f6bler, she focused on microbial communication, in particular quorum sensing and algal-bacterial interactions in the ocean (Roseobacter Transregio[6])./nShe is the author of more than 150 scientific papers,[7] with publications including de novo sequencing of the algal symbiont Dinoroseobacter shibae and its dinoflagellate host Prorocentrum cordatum.", "32516492": "Jonathan Karl Pritchard is an English-born professor of genetics at Stanford University, best known for his development of the STRUCTURE algorithm for studying population structure and his work on human genetic variation and evolution.[3]  His research interests lie in the study of human evolution, in particular in understanding the association between genetic variation among human individuals and human traits.[1][4][5][6][7][8][9][excessive citations]/nPritchard's family moved to the US when he was a teenager.

He attended Vanderbilt University, where he received a degree in physics. He later attended University of Texas at Austin, where he received his Ph.D. in zoology in 1969.[1] He is recognized in the term Eskinogram, and has been a leader in the discovery of mechanisms underlying entrainment of circadian clocks./nIn his early scientific career, Eskin studied circadian rhythms in the house sparrow, while working in chronobiologist Michael Menaker's lab at the University of Texas at Austin./nEskin's most cited paper while in Menaker's lab concerns his research of non-ocular entraining cues in house sparrows.[2]  In it, Eskin and Menaker showed the scientific community the ability of house sparrows to entrain to auditory cues as opposed to previously shown light cues.[2]/nEskin's current research focuses on long-term memory formation. His lab focuses on the role of the circadian clock and the regulation of glutamate uptake in synaptic plasticity, using aplysia and rats as model organisms primarily.[1]/nEskin's lab has extensively studied the role of glutamate transporters in synaptic plasticity in aplysia. Specifically, his group has shown that glutamate uptake increases during long-term sensitization in Aplysia, long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus of rats, and morphine addiction and withdrawal in rats.[3]  Deficiencies in glutamate uptake during changes in synaptic efficacy have also been linked to diseases such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, and Epilepsy.[4] Blockage of NMDA receptors prevents glutamate from binding, which prevents the formation of long-term memory.[5] Eskin's group believes that the mechanism for glutamate uptake is phylogenetically conserved for multiple types of synaptic plasticity. They currently study the mechanism by which this process takes place.[1]/nEskin has also researched the role of the circadian clock in glutaminergic synaptic plasticity. Although it was known that the brain's circadian clock could influence physiological outputs such as sleep and wakefulness, metabolic rate, and body temperature, Eskin suggested that the circadian clock may play another role as a regulator for memory formation.[6] He and his lab have shown that an aplysia's ability to form long-term memory is dependent on the time of day, namely that aplysia are able to form long-term memories during the day, but are unable to at night. This was done via regulation of several factors, including neurotransmitter release, MAPK signaling, and immediate early gene expression.  Short-term memory, however, has not been shown to vary based on time of day.[7]  The mechanism by which this occurs is not currently understood, but Eskin and his lab have continued to study the circadian characteristics of glutamate uptake in synaptic plasticity in order to learn more about the mechanism by which memory formation is controlled by a circadian clock.[6] Furthermore, such information will be useful for chronobiology as a whole in helping explain how a biological clock regulates its outputs to produce rhythm.[1]/nEskin developed the Eskinogram as a heuristic that provides a mechanism for understanding circadian clock pathways. It presents a clock pathway as having three components: input, oscillator, and output. Further modifications to this core model can be made for more complex systems. For example, one oscillator may be able to control multiple outputs.[8]/nThe Eskinogram has notably been used to model how the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) acts as a master oscillator for the human biological clock. A group of photoreceptors called the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) act as the input for the clock mechanism. These cells then use a pathway dependent on melanopsin to signal to the SCN. The SCN then uses a transcription-translation feedback loop, consisting of a set of clock genes that regulate their own expression, to act as a complete oscillator and signal locomotor outputs accordingly.[8]/nThe Eskinogram is regarded as a central dogma for circadian researchers. This has led to Eskin's work being influential to later researchers in chronobiology. For example, Eskin worked closely with Dr. Samer Hattar on his thesis on circadian rhythms.[9]/nFor his contributions to the Department of Biology and Biochemistry, Eskin received the 25th Esther Farfel Award from the University of Houston in 2003. Serving as department chair from 1994 to 2000, he established a focus on research in neuroscience, biological clocks, and infectious disease and tripled research grants to the department.[10]  In the same year, Eskin also received the John and Rebecca Moores Professors Award from the University of Houston.[11]", "58435980": "Clara Cynthia Benson (1875\u20131964) was a Canadian chemist, the sole female founder of the American Society for Biological Chemistry (now the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB)) and one of the first two women to earn a Ph.D. from the University of Toronto (U of T) (the other being philosophy student Emma Baker).[1][2] She later became one of U of T's first two female associate professors.[3] Trained in physical chemistry, she switched focus to biochemistry when lack of job opportunities for female chemists led her to take a position teaching food chemistry as part of U of T's Domestic Science program.[4] She also played a large role in the development of U of T's women's athletics program.[4]/nClara Cynthia Benson was born in Port Hope, Ontario, Canada June 5, 1875 to Thomas Moore Benson and Laura Abigail Fuller.[4] Laura and Thomas, a widowed businessman, lawyer, and judge, had three children together and additionally raised two daughters from Thomas' first marriage.[5] Clara attended Port Hope High School then entered University College of the University of Toronto (U of T) in 1895 to study chemistry, mathematics and physics.[4] This was only one year after the school began admitting women, and women were still not allowed into the school's reading rooms and were denied access to the library catalogues.[5]/nBenson graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in chemistry from U of T in 1899 (the first woman to do so) and continued straight into PhD studies.[5] She earned her doctorate in 1903, making her one of the first two women to earn a Ph.D. from the University of Toronto (U of T) (the other being philosophy student Emma Baker).[5]/nBenson's doctoral research, supervised by William Lash Miller, examined reaction rates of inorganic salt solutions.[6] Her thesis, The rates of the reactions in solutions containing ferrous sulphate, potassium iodide, and chromic acid was published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry (JPC) in May, 1903.[7]/nBenson's early research was in the field of physical chemistry, with an emphasis on reaction rates of inorganic salt solutions.[6] Her 1902 article \"The Rate of Oxidation of Ferrous Salts by Chromic Acid\" may make her the second female author (after Marie Curie) to publish in the Journal of Physical Chemistry (JPC).[8]/nAs a woman, she had difficulty finding a job as a physical chemist after graduating, so she took a position as a demonstrator in food science at U of T's new Lillian Massey School of Domestic Science.[4] She objected to this program's goal of preparing women to be housewives and had even signed a petition organized by University College's Women's Alumnae Association in 1902 questioning the program's introduction.[9] At the time, however, food chemistry was one of the chemistry sub-fields with better professional opportunities for women.[10]/nThis position involved switching from U of T's Chemistry Department to their Physiology (Physiological Chemistry) Department, where she was mentored by the \"Father of the Medical School at Toronto,\" A.B.

From an early age she showed an interest in the natural sciences and read her father's book on zoology. She attended the lyc\u00e9e Concepcion Arenal in Ferrol and in 1931 attended the University of Santiago de Compostela where she graduated summa cum laude in 1933.

During this period, she devoted herself to the study of English and French, which later proved very useful for the development of her research career in the United States.[3]/nIn 1940, she married Eugenio Leira Manso, captain of the Spanish War Navy and Knight of the Royal and Military Order of Saint Hermenegild. Two years later, their daughter was born, Maria de los Angeles Leira Alvari\u00f1o, who is now a well-renowned architect and urbanist based in the US.[3]/nAfter the Civil War, \u00c1ngeles Alvari\u00f1o resumed her studies, and in 1941, she earned her master's degree in Natural Sciences by the University of Madrid. \u00c1ngeles \u00c1lvari\u00f1o returned with her husband to Ferrol where, from 1941 to 1948, she taught biology, zoology, botany, and geology as a professor at various schools. In 1948, she moved back with her family to Madrid to work as a fishery research biologist with the Department of Sea Fisheries. Alvari\u00f1o could not pursue further research studies at the Spanish Institute of Oceanography in Madrid due to a dated Spanish law that prohibited women aboard Spanish naval vessels. However, because she had outstanding academic credentials, she was allowed to take some courses and do some research. In 1951, she received a graduate diploma in Experimental Psychology, Analytical Chemistry and Plant Ecology from the Complutense University of Madrid./nIn 1950, she moved back to Galicia and worked at the  Spanish Oceanographic Institute\u00a0[es]  in Vigo. In 1953, she received a scholarship from the British Council to conduct research on zooplankton in the Marine Biological Association laboratory at Plymouth, England, under the direction of the well-respected experts in zooplankton Frederick S. Russell and Peter C. Corbin. Zooplankton comprise the small floating animals in the ocean that serve as food for other animals and include jellyfish, coral, and sea anemones. These creatures had barely been studied before the 1960s, and she focused in three groups: the microscopic Chaetognatha, which are carnivorous and feed on other plankton; the colonial Siphonophore, which cluster in groups of individuals of the same species (like the Portuguese Man'o'War); and the medusa or jellyfish. By studying the plankton of the English Channel and in the Bay of Biscay, her work led to the discovery of some anomalies in the distribution of plankton species which led to the scientific conclusion that the Atlantic waters had moved poleward in an unusual way. Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles Alvari\u00f1o was the first woman to be appointed as scientist aboard a British research vessel. Throughout her life, she participated in several expeditions and scientific cruises in the Atlantic and Pacific, aboard oceanographic ships from England, America, Spain and Mexico./nIn 1954, Alvari\u00f1o returned to Spain to continue her research on zooplankton. She designed special nets and recruited fishermen and naval research vessels to sample plankton for her in the Atlantic near Spain and near Newfoundland, and in the Mediterranean./nIn 1956, Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles received a fellowship from the Fulbright Commission to conduct scientific work at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute on Cape Cod in Massachusetts, where she worked with Dr. Mary Sears, who was the president of the U.S. Oceanographic Congress and also a zooplankton researcher. Her career ramped up when Dr. Mary Sears, impressed with the quality of her research, recommended \u00c1ngeles Alvari\u00f1o to Dr. Roger Revelle, the director of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, part of the University of California San Diego,  who offered her a position as a biologist. She worked at UCSD from 1958 to 1969 where she studied the zooplankton off the coast of California as well as the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. During this period she discovered 12 new Chaetognatha species, nine siphonophore and one medusa. She also produced a model of the world's distribution of different species of Chaetognatha and Siphonophora. This research formed the basis of her doctoral dissertation[title\u00a0missing]; she received a PhD from the University of Madrid in 1967. She received various grants from institutions such as the U.S. Office of the Navy, the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations, and the US National Science Foundation./nIn January 1970, she was appointed to a position as Fisheries Research Biologist at the prestigious Southwest Fisheries Science Center (which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). Here she continued her research in Chaetognatha, Siphonophora, and studied the relationship between the predatory behavior of these organisms and the survival of fish larvae. She also studied the distribution of Chaetognatha and Siphonophora species in the Pacific and Antarctic Oceans, and plankton movement, in particular the effect of plankton introductions through pollution or ship movements./nIn the later 1970s, Alvari\u00f1o worked to coordinate oceanic research among Latin American nations, and she studied the Antarctic. During this period she received various grants from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and from the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)./nShe retired as Emeritus Scientist in 1993 but continued to conduct research on seagoing vessels hosted by various countries.

Her work led to the use of ACE inhibitors in hypertension treatment to keep angiotensin in its inactive state, angiotensin I. Dr. Oparil\u2019s work with angiotensin and ACE inhibitors proved to be foundational to hypertension research.[4]/nOparil continues to research novel approaches to treat hypertension as well as organ damage related to treatments. She also investigates hormonal modulation of inflammatory responses to vascular injury and mechanisms of estrogen-mediated vasoprotection.

The bacteria is one of the best models of intracellular parasitism because it is particularly hardy, able to survive in a variety of cells, cross multiple host barriers, and spreads through ActA, the protein responsible for actin-based motility.[6]  Cossart's work has shed light on the genetic and biochemical processes that make Listeria so effective and lethal, identifying the bsh gene; regulatory mechanisms such as an RNA thermosensor that control expression of the virulence genes such as bsh; and the ways in which Listeria enters cells and crosses physiological barriers such as the blood\u2013brain barrier, the intestinal barrier, and the placental barrier.  The discovery by Cossart's lab of the interaction between L. monocytogenes' protein, internalin, and its cell receptor, E-cadherin, was the first such study that successfully demonstrated the molecular mechanism that permits a bacterial agent to cross the placental barrier.[3]/nIn 2009 Cossart published what she describes as the first \"bacterial operon map\"\u2014the transcriptional program that regulates Listeria's behavior in different environmental conditions.[7] By comparing the sequences of Listeria drawn from soil and drawn from the human gut, Cossart identified non-coding RNAs that contribute to Listeria's virulence, identified additional RNA repressors, and determined that riboswitches can act both downstream and upstream.[3]/nAs part of her work she has also developed important biological tools, including a transgenic mouse that was the first animal model to overcome bacterial species-specificity.

He was the Sherardian Professor of Botany at the University of Oxford from 1953 to 1971./nDarlington's research on genetics contributed to the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 20th century.[3] However, many of his views are controversial; Darlington was listed in 1999 by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an example of a prominent race scientist who espoused antisemitism, eugenics, racism, and social Darwinism.[4]/nCyril Darlington was born in Chorley, a small cotton town in Lancashire, England in 1903. His father, William was a teacher at a small school. He had one brother six years older. When he was eight, the family moved to London. His childhood was an unhappy one, characterised by a stern, bitter, and frustrated father, who struggled mightily against poverty. He enjoyed neither sports nor studies (including at the Mercers' School and St Paul's School, London).[5][6][7] He began to develop a disdain for authority. He decided to become a farmer in Australia, so he applied to the South Eastern Agricultural College at Wye, known later as Wye College.  He was a rather indifferent student, but his social life took a decided turn for the better when he took up boxing, with some success. He was then six feet three inches tall, and an imposing figure. One subject that captured his imagination, however, was Mendelian genetics, taught by the myriapodologist Stanley Graham Brade-Birks.[8] Darlington discovered Thomas Hunt Morgan's The Physical Basis of Heredity.  He graduated with a London University Ordinary degree in 1923./nAfter being turned down for a scholarship to go to Trinidad as a farmer, Cyril was induced in 1923 by one of his professors to apply for a scholarship at the John Innes Horticultural Institution in Merton. He wrote at once to its director, William Bateson, famous for having introduced the word \"genetics\" into biology. His application was unsuccessful, but he wrangled a temporary post as an unpaid technician. It was an interesting time for the Innes. Bateson had spent the last two decades fighting against the notion that chromosomes were the seat of what he had been calling \"heredity factors\" and had only very recently capitulated.  He had just hired a cytologist, Frank Newton, who now began to take Cyril under his wing. Darlington published his first scientific paper, on the tetraploidy of the sour cherry, and he was hired as a permanent employee./nShortly after, both of his mentors, Bateson and Newton, died within a year of each other and J.B.S. Haldane came to the Innes. Although neither an experimentalist nor cytologist, Haldane formed a close friendship with Darlington, whose self-confidence grew. He began to make contributions to the understanding of the relationship of genetic crossing-over and the microscopically observed events that the chromosome passed through during meiosis./nIn February 1929 he made a study trip with fellow botanist John Macqueen Cowan to the Near East.[9]/nIn 1931 he began writing the book that would establish his reputation, Recent Advances in Cytology.  It was published in 1932, and created, at first, a firestorm of controversy then nearly universal acceptance.[citation needed] He showed that the mechanisms of evolution that acted at the level of the chromosome created possibilities far richer than the simple mutations and deletions that affect single genes.[citation needed]/nHe became Director of the Cytology Department in 1937, and he became director of the Innes two years later, just 15 years after his arrival as an unpaid volunteer. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 20 March 1941. A few months after that, he was awarded the Royal Medal, and then was elected president of the Genetical Society. In 1947 he co-founded with Ronald Fisher the journal Heredity: An International Journal of Genetics, as a response to J.B.S. Haldane joining the Communist party and \"taking the Journal of Genetics with him\".[10]/nHe left the Innes in 1953 and accepted the Sherardian Chair of Botany at Oxford University. He developed an interest in the Botanic Garden, going on to establish the 'Genetic Garden'. He was also involved in extending the teaching of science, especially genetics, in the university.[citation needed] He continued to voice support for the belief that human genetics determine behaviour./nIn 1972 he, along with 50 other scientists signed \"Resolution on Scientific Freedom Regarding Human Behavior and Heredity\" in which a genetic approach to understanding the behaviour of man was strongly defended. He staunchly defended his colleague, John Baker, who published the controversial book \"Race\" in 1974, in the fight against Lysenkoism. Asked by a reporter for The Sunday Times whether or not he was a racist for this connection to John Baker, who believed that no civilizations had ever arisen in Africa, all \"negrids\" had a \"fetid smell\" and were \"less evolved,\"[11] Darlington replied: \"Well, I'm regarded as one by everyone except the Jews, who are racist, and who utterly agree with my views.\"[citation needed]/nDarlington retired from his official position at the University in 1971, but remained in the university, writing and publishing his work. He died in Oxford in 1981. He had five children, two of whom committed suicide./nIn his later years, Darlington increased his participation in the public debate about the role of science in society, and especially, its interaction with politics and government. He published, beginning in 1948, strong condemnations of the events in the Soviet Union, which had denounced Mendelian genetics and officially outlawed its practice in favour of Lysenkoism.[citation needed]Some genetics institutes were destroyed, and prominent geneticists were purged or murdered. These events caused an upheaval among the leaders of genetics in the west, many of whom were leftist, socialists, communists, and Marxists.[citation needed] This caused a break between Haldane and Darlington, who was intransigent in his anti-authoritarian views./nDarlington developed a strong interest in the application of genetic insights to the understanding of human history.  He believed that not only were there differences in the character and culture between individuals, but that these differences also exist between races. To him, understanding of these differences in scientific terms was not only interesting in its own right, but was crucial to the development of a civil society./nThe nature of his views on race is well illustrated by his essay in Human Variation: The Biopsychology of Age, Race, and Sex (Academic Press 1978).  Darlington writes that \"as slaves,\" enslaved diasporic Africans \"improved in health and increased in numbers,\" without addressing the role of forced slave breeding in the United States. He repeated the myth that their environment was \"more favorable than anything they had experienced in Africa.\" According to Darlington, emancipation of slaves resulted in the withdrawal of \"discipline\" and \"protection\" resulting in social problems such as \"drugs, gambling, and prostitution.\"/nDarlington concluded: \"The intellectually well-endowed races, classes, and societies have a moral responsibility for the problems of race mixture, of immigration and exploitation, that have arisen from their exercise of economic and political power. They may hope to escape from these responsibilities by claiming an intellectual and, therefore, moral equality between all races, classes, and societies. But the chapters of this book, step by step, deprive them of the scientific and historical evidence that might support such a comfortable illusion.\" In simple terms, Darlington believed that there are inherent, unchangeable, and uniform differences between the races, and those are the main causes of societal ills./nDarlington was opposed to the UNESCO Statement of Race. He agreed with Darwin's classical view: \"The races differ also in constitution, in acclimatization, and in liability to certain diseases. Their mental characteristics are likewise very distinct; chiefly as it would appear in their emotional, but partly in their intellectual, faculties.\" To simplify, Darlington believed that there is a difference not just in skin color and disease vulnerability between races, but also in intelligence./nDarlington thought that there might be a biological justification to prohibit interracial marriages \"if intermarriage were not contrary to the habits of all stable communities and therefore in no need of discouragement.\"[citation needed] He refused to sign the revised 1951 statement which conceded that racial differences in intelligence possibly existed. Darlington's dissenting commentary was printed with the statement.[12]/nOver the course of twenty five years, from 1953 to 1978, Darlington completed his trilogy on Man: Genetics and Man (1953), The Evolution of Man and Society (1969) and finally The Little Universe of Man (1978). In these he tried to show how the history of man can be at least partially analysed in terms of genetic laws, breeding patterns, founder effects, and Darwinian evolution.[citation needed]/n(A partial list)", "66267638": "Schitt's Creek (stylized as Schitt'$ Creek) is a Canadian television sitcom created by Dan Levy and his father, Eugene Levy, that aired on CBC Television from 2015 to 2020. It consists of 80 episodes spread over six seasons.[1][2] Produced by Not a Real Company Productions[3] and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, it follows the trials and tribulations of the formerly wealthy Rose family. After their business manager embezzles the family business, Rose Video, the family loses its fortune and relocates to Schitt's Creek, a town they once purchased as a joke.[4] Now living in a motel, Johnny (Eugene Levy) and Moira (Catherine O'Hara) \u2014 along with their adult children, David (Dan Levy) and Alexis (Annie Murphy) \u2014 must adjust to life without wealth.[4]/nThe series concept came from Dan Levy who wondered how wealthy families, as frequently depicted on American reality television, would react if they lost all their money.[5] He developed the series with his father Eugene before pitching it to several Canadian and American networks. It was first sold to CBC Television in Canada and secured final funding to start production in its sale to Pop in the United States.[6] Although limited in popularity for its first few seasons, its regional appearances on Netflix after its third season is credited for its rise in stature (the so named \"Netflix bump\") and a dynamic social media presence.[7]/nSchitt's Creek received critical acclaim and garnered a cult following, particularly for its writing, humour and acting. It has won various prizes, including two ACTRA Awards and 18 Canadian Screen Awards.[8][9] It is the first Canadian comedy series to be nominated for a Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Comedy Series.[10] It also received two Screen Actors Guild Awards, including Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series and a total of 19 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Comedy Series twice.[11][12][13] It received 15 of these nominations for its sixth and final season, setting a record for most Emmy nominations for a comedy series's final season.[13] For its portrayal of LGBTQ+ people, it received three nominations for a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comedy Series, winning twice.[14][15]/nAt the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards, the series' final season swept all seven major comedy awards. It was the first time a comedy or drama series received all seven awards; Dan Levy notably received Outstanding Comedy Series, Writing and Directing for a Comedy Series (sharing the last with Andrew Cividino). It set records for winning all four major acting categories (Lead Actor/Actress and Supporting Actor/Actress) for O'Hara, Murphy and both Levys\u2014a first for a comedy or drama series;[16] for most Emmy wins by a comedy series in a single season (beating The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel's 2018 record), and for most Emmy nominations and wins by a comedy series in its final season./nThe wealthy Rose family \u2014 video store magnate Johnny (Eugene Levy), his wife and former soap opera actress Moira (Catherine O'Hara), and their pampered adult children David (Dan Levy) and Alexis (Annie Murphy) \u2014 lose their fortune after being defrauded by their business manager. They rebuild their lives with their sole remaining asset: a remote town named Schitt's Creek, which Johnny bought for David's birthday in 1991 as a joke.[4]/nThe Roses are forced to relocate to Schitt's Creek, moving into two adjacent rooms in a run-down motel. While the family adjusts to their new lives, their well-to-do attitudes conflict with the town's more provincial residents, including mayor Roland Schitt (Chris Elliott), his wife Jocelyn (Jenn Robertson), and their son Mutt (Tim Rozon), the motel's clerk Stevie Budd (Emily Hampshire), town council members Ronnie Lee (Karen Robinson) and Bob Currie (John Hemphill), veterinarian Ted Mullens (Dustin Milligan), and Jazzagal member and Caf\u00e9 Tropical waitress Twyla Sands (Sarah Levy).[4]/nMain/nRecurring/nDan Levy came up with the idea for the show while watching reality television. \"I had been watching some reality TV at the time and was concentrating on what would happen if one of these wealthy families would lose everything. Would the Kardashians still be the Kardashians without their money?\"[5] He turned to his father Eugene to help develop the show, who came up with the series title. Dan decided to make the location of Schitt's Creek vague, but has said that it is in Canada.[17][18]/nThe premise of being forced to move to a town they once bought as a joke was inspired by actress Kim Basinger's $20\u00a0million purchase of the town of Braselton, Georgia in 1989.[19][20][21][22][23] Eugene Levy said, \"My wife had an idea for a television show about boomers not having money or moving in with their kids. Their situation was described as being up sh\u2013's creek  [sic]. It just made us laugh. Then my son Daniel came in with an article one day about an actress, Alec Baldwin's ex-wife (Basinger), who bought a town. She was hoping that film people would come to the town to use it as a location area and she lost a lot of money. The idea of wealthy people buying a town went back to the Schitt's Creek idea.\"[24]/nThe Levys initially pitched the show to several networks in Canada and the United States. Cable networks HBO and Showtime passed on the series, while a broadcast network in America and the CBC in Canada expressed interest. The show was first sold to the CBC, but the Levys decided against major U.S. broadcasters after getting nervous about their reputation for creative interference. Schitt's Creek eventually found a U.S. home on Pop TV after striking a deal with network head Brad Schwartz, who had previously hired Dan on MTV Canada.[6]/nDuring the early stages of development, various networks suggested the title of the show be changed to avoid the vulgar word. The Levys resisted these suggestions and argued \"Schitt\" was a legitimate last name. To prove their point, they brought pages copied from a phone book to the CBC showing listings for individuals with the \"Schitt\" surname. The CBC agreed and allowed the Levys to keep the original title.[25]/nDan Levy initially envisioned the series ending with season five, but agreed to a sixth season after receiving a two-year renewal following the show's fourth season.[26]/nCatherine O'Hara was the series creators' first choice for the role of eccentric family matriarch, Moira Rose. O'Hara had previously worked with Eugene Levy on SCTV and several of Christopher Guest's films. She initially turned down Levy's offer to star, citing \"laziness\" and an aversion to long-term projects. Levy reached out to another (unnamed) actress, but continued to court O'Hara for the role. O'Hara eventually agreed to participate in the presentation pilot with no obligation to continue in the role after Schitt's Creek was ordered to series. After the show was picked up by the CBC, O'Hara agreed to continue in the role.[27]/nAnnie Murphy was offered the role of spoiled socialite Alexis Rose after actress Abby Elliott was unable to continue due to scheduling conflicts.[28] Murphy was on the verge of giving up on acting since she had not worked in over two years when she got an email inviting her to audition for the role.[29] She first auditioned in Los Angeles, where Dan Levy said she stood out due to her \"wonderfully natural likability.\"[30] Eugene Levy was unsure of Murphy's casting because she did not possess the blonde hair he had pictured for the role of Alexis. Murphy was subsequently called back for a second audition for a different role, sarcastic motel clerk Stevie Budd. After this audition, Dan Levy convinced his father that Murphy could dye her hair blonde, and she was officially cast as Alexis Rose.[28]/nEmily Hampshire was cast as the deadpan motel clerk, Stevie Budd, after auditioning for the role in Los Angeles. She originally requested to submit a taped audition on account of her nerves and recurring hive breakouts. Hampshire ultimately agreed to audition in person, but states she has no recollection of the experience. According to Daniel Levy, who was present for the process, Hampshire gave a \"great\" audition, then proceeded to lift her shirt over her head to hide and slowly rocked back and forth. Levy later told Hampshire he found her audition \"charming\", and she was offered the part of Stevie.[31]/nNoah Reid was offered the role of David's business partner and love interest, Patrick Brewer, in season three. Dan Levy was socially familiar with Reid and invited him to audition on the suggestion of Stacey Farber.[32] Reid had never watched the show before he auditioned and was unsure how long the character would be a part of the series.[33][34] Dan Levy was not present during the audition process and did not \"chemistry test\" with Reid before he was cast.[26]/nOther cast regulars Chris Elliott and Sarah Levy were given the roles of Roland Schitt and Twyla Sands, respectively, without auditioning. Elliott says when Eugene Levy offered him the role of the town mayor, he thought, \"Why would I say no?\"[35] Sarah Levy, the daughter of Eugene and sister of Dan, was asked to be a part of the show before it was fully developed.[36] She says she was glad not to be cast as Alexis, as being out of her family's orbit on the show allowed her to \"do [her] own thing.\"[37]/nSchitt's Creek is produced by Not a Real Company Productions in association with the CBC and Pop TV.[3] Pop TV joined the production team in season two after the series' first season was produced solely in association with the CBC.[38] ITV Studios Global Entertainment also partnered with the CBC and Pop to distribute the show worldwide.[6] Eugene Levy, Dan Levy, Fred Levy (Eugene's brother),[39] Andrew Barnsley, and Ben Feigin have served as executive producers throughout the show's entirety.[40][41][42] Other executive producers have included writers Kevin White (seasons two and three) and David West Read (seasons five and six).[40][41][43][44] Eugene Levy served as showrunner alongside co-creator and son, Dan Levy, during the series' first season; Dan Levy took over as sole showrunner beginning in season two.[45]/nSchitt's Creek was part of a \"new direction\" in programming taken by both the CBC and Pop TV during the 2014\u201315 television season.[46] Premiering alongside 12 new primetime shows on the CBC, the series represented one of the network's efforts to produce more \"serialized, scripted\" content, as well as more \"cable-like\" shows.[46][47][48] The series was also the first original, scripted program to air on Pop TV after its re-branding in January 2015. Formerly known as TV Guide Network, Pop TV was re-branded as a channel \"filled with optimism, passion, funny and excitement\".[49]/nSchitt's Creek was filmed using a single camera set-up with no live audience or laugh track.[50] The interior scenes for the first two seasons were filmed at Pinewood Toronto Studios in the Port Lands area of Toronto,[25] while interior scenes for season three were shot at Dufferin Gate Studios in (Etobicoke) Toronto.[51] Interior scenes were also filmed at Revival Studios in (Leslieville) Toronto for an unknown number of seasons.[52] The remainder of the series is filmed on location in Goodwood, the Regional Municipality of Durham in the Greater Toronto Area, Brantford and Mono, where the motel scenes are filmed.[53] Goodwood was one of 30 towns scouted for the fictional location of Schitt's Creek before production of the series began in 2014.[54] The Canadian Press wrote June 27, 2019 that Goodwood had become a \"tourist hot spot\" as filming for the current season concluded.[55]/nThe series was filmed in several additional locations during its run. The opening shot of the first season features Lisa Vanderpump\u2019s former Beverly Park estate in Los Angeles as the facade of the Rose family estate. Interior shots of the Rose family estate were filmed on location in a Sistine Chapel-inspired mansion in Toronto (30 Fifeshire Road near Bayview Avenue and York Mills Road).[54] Main Street Stouffville served as a filming location for an unspecified number of scenes (Thicketwood Veterinary Hospital) in the series' first two seasons. Applewood Farm and Winery in Stouffville was also used. Scenes involving the fictional retailer, Blouse Barn, in seasons two and three were filmed on location on Main Street Unionville in Markham.[56][57] In the season four episode \"The Jazzaguy,\" scenes involving a spa retreat were filmed on location at Monte Carlo Inn in Vaughan, Ontario.[58] Exterior filming also took place at Rattlesnake Point in Milton for season five's \"The Hike\".[59] In season six's \"Smoke Signals\", the series shot on location at Graydon Hall Manor, a wedding venue in Toronto.[60] The series also filmed in Bay-Adelaide Centre and Toronto-Dominion Centre for the season six episode \"The Pitch\".[52] Additional filming for several season six episodes took place at a local motel in Brantford.[61]/nThe former Hockley Motel in Mono, where the exterior shots of the Rosebud Motel were filmed, was marketed for sale by its owners in November 2020.[62]/nThe Schitt's Creek soundtrack is composed by Canadian film and television composer/songwriter Maribeth Solomon./nThe show features several musical performances from its main and supporting characters. The majority of these performances feature the town singing group, the Jazzagals. The Jazzagals' main members are Moira Rose, Jocelyn Schitt, Twyla Sands, Ronnie Lee, and Gwen Currie. Throughout the series, they covered \"It's Raining Men\"; \"Baby, I'm Yours\"; \"Takin' It Home\"; \"Silent Night\"; and \"Islands in the Stream\".[63]/nIn season one's \"Carl's Funeral\", Moira sings an unaccompanied version of \"Danny Boy\" as a distraction when Johnny's eulogy goes awry. She performs the same song a second time later in the episode.[63]/nIn season two's \"The Motel Guest\", Schitt's Creek's mayor Roland Schitt stays for the night next door to the Roses and plays the song \"Don't Cry Out Loud\" sung by Melissa Manchester loud continually, annoying Johnny and Moira.[64]/nIn season four's \"Asbestos Fest\", David and Moira perform a duet known as \"The Number\". This medley of holiday songs was regularly performed at the annual Rose Christmas party and included \"Oh Come, All Ye Faithful\", \"Deck the Halls\", and \"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\". The song was arranged by Moira's portrayer, Catherine O\u2019Hara.[65]/nIn season four's \"Open Mic\", Patrick sings an acoustic cover of Tina Turner's \"The Best\" as a declaration of love to David. The song was arranged and performed by Patrick's portrayer, Noah Reid.[66] After airing on Schitt's Creek, Reid's version of the song was released on Spotify and iTunes, where it reached No. 1 on the Canadian charts. All proceeds from the single were donated to the Ontario charity, LGBT Youth Line.[67]/nIn season five's \"The Hospies\", Alexis auditions for a community theatre production by singing \"A Little Bit Alexis\", the theme song from her \"critically reviewed, limited reality series\" of the same name. Alexis's portrayer, Annie Murphy, who wrote and performed the song for the show, says she drew inspiration from the pop songs of Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan. Menno Versteeg and Nixon Boyd of the Canadian band Hollerado also helped produce the song.[68] \"A Little Bit Alexis\" was released as a single on Spotify and iTunes, where it reached No. 28 on the Canadian charts.[69] Partial proceeds from the single were donated to MusiCounts, a Canadian organization providing music resources to schools in need.[70]/nIn season five's \"Life Is a Cabaret\", several main characters perform \"Willkommen\" from the musical Cabaret. Stevie also sings a second number, \"Maybe This Time\", as her Cabaret character, Sally Bowles, in the same episode.[71] Both songs were performed in front of a live audience during filming.[72]/nIn season six's \"Happy Ending\", the series finale, the Jazzagals sing a cappella versions of James Morrison's \"Precious Love\" and Tina Turner's \"The Best\" at David and Patrick's wedding. Noah Reid's Patrick also sings a portion of Mariah Carey's \"Always Be My Baby\" as part of his wedding vows to David in the same episode.[73]/nSchitt's Creek has been co-broadcast in Canada and the United States since 2015.

He was cited by Bryan Sykes in Adam's Curse: A Future Without Men.[3]/nPage was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in 1956 and grew up in the rural outskirts of Pennsylvania Dutch country.[1][4][5] The first of his family to go to college, Page attended Swarthmore College, where he graduated with a BA with highest honors in chemistry in 1978.[4][6] During his final year at Swarthmore, Page attended class just one day a week and spent the rest of his time researching chromatin structure in the laboratory of molecular biologist Robert Simpson at the National Institutes of Health.[4][6] In 1978, Page enrolled at Harvard Medical School and the Harvard-MIT Health Sciences Program, where he worked in the laboratories of David Botstein at MIT and Raymond White at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.[6] In White's lab, Page worked on a project to develop a genetic linkage map of the human genome that would become a precursor to the Human Genome Project.[1] The work relied on locating restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP). The first RFLP that Page found was from a site of homology between the X chromosome and Y chromosome, a coincidence that would set the direction of his subsequent career.[1]/nPage finished his MD degree in the spring of 1984 and started his own lab as the first Whitehead Fellow at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research researching the genetics of XX male syndrome, or de la Chapelle Syndrome.[1][6] After Page won the MacArthur \"Genius Grant\" in 1986, Page was promoted to the faculty of the Whitehead Institute and the MIT Department of Biology in 1988.[6][7] In 1990, Page was named a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, and in 2005 he was named as director of the Whitehead Institute.[6]/nPage has worked in several areas of genetics.[8][9]/nIn his work on de la Chapelle Syndrome in 1986, Page collaborated with the geneticist who originally identified the first XX male, Albert de la Chapelle, and geneticist Jean Weissenbach to show that XX males carry a small piece of the Y chromosome.[1][10][11]/nIn the following year, he reported that the gene ZFY induced the development of the testes, a finding which received a great deal of media attention since it putatively resolving a decade-long search for the sex-determining gene.[1][12] In 1989, a British team of scientists led by Peter Goodfellow and Robin Lovell-Badge began to report that the testis-determining gene was not ZFY, which led Page to review his data. Page found that he had misinterpreted his data because one of the XY females in his study had a second deletion at the site which proved to be the location of the real sex-determining gene. Launching a second round of media attention, Nature published his findings together with a paper from the British group that identified the sex-determining gene, which they termed SRY.[1][12][13]/nDespite a belief among geneticists that the Y chromosome contained few genes other than the sex-determining gene, Page continued to map the Y chromosome. He had already published DNA-based deletion maps of the Y chromosome in 1986,[14] and went on to develop comprehensive clone-based physical maps of the chromosome in 1992[15][16] and systematic catalogs of Y-linked genes in 1997.[17] Page collaborated with a team at the Genome Institute at Washington University to make a complete map of the Y chromosome, which they achieved in 2003.[18] To do so, Page and his colleagues developed a new sequencing technique, single-haplotype iterative mapping and sequencing (SHIMS), since mammalian sex chromosomes contain too many repetitive sequences to be sequenced by conventional approaches.[4] The development of SHIMS allowed Page to identify long palindromic sequences on the long arm of the Y chromosome, which he would go on to show made the Y chromosome vulnerable to the deletions that cause spermatogenic failure (an inability to produce sperm).[19] In 2012, Page characterized the most common genetic cause of spermatogenic failure, the deletion of the AZFc region of the Y chromosome.[20][21] The lab also found that aberrant crossing over within the Y chromosome's palindromes underlies a wide range of disorders of sexual differentiation, including Turner syndrome.[20]/nWith the development of more detailed maps of the Y chromosome, in the mid-1990s Page began to find genetic evidence confirming the theory that both the X and Y chromosomes had evolved from autosomes, beginning with the 1996 discovery that a family of genes called DAZ (deleted in azoospermia) had been transposed from an autosome to the Y chromosome.[4][22] In 1999, Page and his then-graduate student Bruce Lahn showed that the X and Y chromosomes had diverged in four steps, beginning 200-300 million years ago.[23] Later cross-species comparisons would show that while ancestral genes on the Y chromosome initially underwent rapid decay,[18][24] the remaining genes have remained stable for the last 25 million years,[25] overturning the long-held view that the Y chromosome was going extinct.[4] In a 2014 study, Page concluded that the conserved genes on the Y chromosome played an important role in male viability, since they were dosage-dependent genes with similar but not identical counterparts on the X chromosome that all have regulatory roles in transcription, translation, and protein stability. Because these genes are expressed throughout the body, Page further concluded that these genes give rise to differences in the biochemistry of male and female tissues.[26]/nIn super-resolution studies of the sex chromosomes, Page has found evidence of an evolutionary \"arms race\" between the X and Y chromosomes for transmission to the next generation. In one study, Page found that human X and mouse Y chromosomes have converged, independently acquiring and amplifying gene families expressed in testicular germ cells.[27] Another study found that the mouse Y chromosome had acquired and massively amplified genes homologous to the testis-expressed gene families on the mouse X chromosome.[28]/nPage used the mouse as a model to study the genetics of meiotic initiation, showing that retinoic acid (RA) is the key factor which induces meiosis, as well as identifying several important genes crucial to the meiotic initiation pathway, including Stra8 and DAZL.[29][30][31] Page further discovered that the differentiation germ cells into gametocytes (oocytes in females or spermatocytes in males) does not depend on meiotic initiation, as commonly thought, showing that germ cells deficient in Stra8, a gene that activates the meiotic pathway, are still capable of growth and differentiation.[32][33]/nHis honors and awards include:", "36383238": "Raden Moehamad Djoehana Wiradikarta (born 18 September 1896 in Bandung, Indonesia \u2013 died in 1986 in Bandung) was a professor in microbiology and serology at the Bandung Institute of Technology and the faculty of medicine at Padjadjaran University, also in Bandung.

He is chiefly known as the founder and grandmaster of the international school of Cuong Nhu Oriental Martial Arts. Having served as a college president in South Vietnam before the fall of Saigon in 1975, he spent time in a re-education camp until escaping in a small boat. He taught entomology at the University of Florida for the remainder of his career, guiding the international Cuong Nhu martial arts community at the same time./nFrom 1961 to 1971 he was a professor in the Department of Biology of Hue University, South Vietnam, during which time he founded the Cuong Nhu style of martial arts. After the devastating 1968 Tet offensive and the communist Massacre at Hue, Grandmaster Dong organized a civil defense organization, the People's Self-Defense Forces of Hue, to help protect the public from the violence spawned by the war. His organization engaged some 25,000 people in a program of karate, games and friendly competition to rebuild morale and spirit during the Vietnam War./nIn 1974, Dong earned his PhD in Entomology from the University of Florida, Gainesville, and during this period (1971\u201374) founded and incorporated the first Cuong Nhu Karate club in the United States. He then returned to South Vietnam and served as the President of Da Nang College until the fall of Saigon and the communist victory in 1975. An outspoken opponent of communism, Dong was placed under house arrest in 1975, and spent time in a re-education camp. He and his family escaped by boat to Indonesia and eventually reached the United States in 1977. From then until his retirement he served as a professor in the Department of Entomology and Nematology at the University of Florida in Gainesville./nIn 1986 Dong took up long-distance running. He soon completed his first two marathons, on consecutive weekends. His first ultra-marathon was the 100-mile Western States run in Squaw Valley, California. In all, he completed 23 marathons, eight 50-mile ultra-marathons and fourteen 100-mile ultra-marathons./nUpon his retirement from the University of Florida, the City of Gainesville and Alachua County, Florida, honored him by declaring August 14, 1994 as Dr. Ngo Dong Day. To commemorate his life, his family commissioned an oriental plant garden to be built and maintained in his honor at Kanapaha Nature Center in Gainesville. This garden contains plants and flowers that he liked as well as a plaque dedicated to his memory./nAs a boy, Dong learned Vovinam, the Vietnamese system of martial arts, from Ngo Quoc Phong, one of the top five students of Vovinam's founder Grandmaster Nguyen Loc. Dong also learned Wing Chun from his two elder brothers, who had studied with Chinese Master Te Kong. Although their father, Ngo Khanh Thuc, was Attorney General of Vietnam, the Ngo brothers tested their fighting skills on the street by engaging hustlers and professional street fighters from the alleys and back streets of Hanoi. After moving south to Hu\u1ebf in 1956 after the partition of Vietnam, Ngo Dong began Shotokan karate training under former Japanese captain Choji Suzuki. After years of training, Ngo Dong earned his fourth degree black belt in Shotokan, and a black belt in judo. Later, Dong studied with American Marine Lt. Ernest H. Cates, a judo and Goshin Jujitsu instructor who had placed first at the U.S. Olympic judo trials. He eventually synthesized his broad martial arts knowledge into his own style, Cuong Nhu, which means \"hard-soft\" in Vietnamese./nDuring a special ceremony in May 1994, Grandmaster Dong was promoted to 6th degree in judo, by Sensei Ed Szrejter, then Executive Director of the U.S. Judo Association.

It was like in a spy movie, I'll tell the whole story later on when we'll meet together. I was indebted to my friend Mr. Vo Dinh Chuc who owned a small boat ... in a small harbor 300 km North of Saigon, consented to bring us along with his family. The two families had to leave Saigon by small groups (two or three people each group) bringing nothing except clothes on the body (we'd be arrested if we brought luggage or money, or went in a group like a family) we changed to a bus and then trucks, at last we arrived at the place at night, we jumped in the boat and fled to the ocean at 9:30 pm June 18. On June 22 we ran out of fuel, food, water. We called SOS for 2 days. We met 14 big ships but they didn't answer our SOS call. At last an Indonesian ship (6500 tons) named Garsa Tiga picked us up in the ocean; by then we had covered already 600km without sleeping. They brought us to Singapore where we had no permission to land, then we arrived Djakarta 27 June, we had to stay aboard two days for investigation because we didn't have papers. A delegation of the United Nations and the US Embassy came to interview us, and we filled out many forms. Then we moved to a Vietnamese refugee camp where 108 other Vietnamese refugees lived there already six months waiting for permission to go to USA, Australia and France. All procedures took a very long time. We hope that Cuong Nhu Karate Association can help us to shorten our stay in Djakarta by sending letters sponsoring my family and my friend's family, Vo Dinh Chuc, the man who saved us in bringing us along with him in his boat.

PRC\u2019s are used throughout the field today to help illustrate the change of a biological oscillation in response to an external stimulus.[3]  She worked as a biology professor at the University of South Carolina (USC) from 1967 until her retirement as director of the W. Gordon Belser Arboretum in 2019./nAt an early age, DeCoursey expressed much interest in nature. She became fascinated with the outdoors though traveling with her father, a physician, and the rest of her family to remote wilderness areas [4] While attending Hunter College High School in New York City she began collecting data on the songbirds of a hardwood forest in Long Island. She mapped the number and location of the birds as well as their distinctive calls.

The relevant paper was about flying squirrels kept in constant darkness and how they would respond to different pulses of light at different times of the day.  The compilation of this data produced the first PRC.[6]/nDeCoursey was the first scientist to show that the mammalian clocks can be reset by light pulses. She also showed that the photoreceptive system responsible for entrainment is different from the system involved in visual image perception.[7]/nDeCoursey helped the scientific world understand the adaptive value of the mammalian biological clocks (found within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)). From April 1997-October 1998 she set up an enclosure for approximately 74 chipmunks. 30 chipmunks had lesions in their SCN, 24 others were surgical control and 20 others were intact controls. After 80 days she showed that the majority of the chipmunks killed by predators had lesions in their SCN. This gave evidence to support that having a mammalian circadian clock is a favorable trait that has been naturally selected for.[8] \nIn an outdoor enclosure, DeCoursey released white-tailed antelope ground squirrels which had various levels of SCN lesioned.  The squirrels displaying the most activity during the night had the highest amount of lesioning.[9]  This research has helped further our understanding of sleep related issues affecting humans such as jet lag or insomnia./nHer recent research focused on the physiological and behavioral aspects of circadian rhythms. She studied how the retina moves in response to the daily rhythm. Also, as mentioned above, her work on chipmunks helped uncover the adaptive value of the circadian clock in the wild.

Herschel was made a Knight of the Royal Guelphic Order in 1831.[6] He also seemed to be aware of Indian thought and mathematics introduced to him by George Everest as claimed by Mary Boole:[10]/nSome time about 1825, he came to England for two or three years, and made a fast and lifelong friendship with Herschel and with Babbage, who was then quite young.(.) My uncle returned from India. He never interfered with anyone's religious beliefs or customs. But no one under his influence could continue to believe in anything in the Bible being specially sacred, except the two elements which it has in common with other sacred books: the knowledge of our relation to others and of man's power to hold direct converse with the unseen truth./nHe stated in his historical article Mathematics in Brewster's Cyclopedia:/nThe Brahma Sidd'hanta, the work of Brahmagupta, an Indian astronomer at the beginning of the seventh century, contains a general method for the resolution of indeterminate problems of the second degree; an investigation which actually baffled the skill of every modern analyst till the time of Lagrange's solution, not excepting the all inventive Euler himself.[10][11]/nHerschel served as president of the Royal Astronomical Society three times: 1827\u20131829, 1839\u20131841 and 1847\u20131849.[12][13]/nHerschel's A preliminary discourse on the study of natural philosophy, published early in 1831 as part of Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet cyclop\u00e6dia, set out methods of scientific investigation with an orderly relationship between observation and theorising. He described nature as being governed by laws which were difficult to discern or to state mathematically, and the highest aim of natural philosophy was understanding these laws through inductive reasoning, finding a single unifying explanation for a phenomenon. This became an authoritative statement with wide influence on science, particularly at the University of Cambridge where it inspired the student Charles Darwin with \"a burning zeal\" to contribute to this work.[14][15][16]/nHe was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1854.[17]/nHerschel published a catalogue of his astronomical observations in 1864, as the General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters, a compilation of his own work and that of his father's, expanding on the senior Herschel's Catalogue of Nebulae. A further complementary volume was published posthumously, as the General Catalogue of 10,300 Multiple and Double Stars./nHerschel correctly considered astigmatism to be due to irregularity of the cornea and theorised that vision could be improved by the application of some animal jelly contained in a capsule of glass against the cornea. His views were published in an article entitled Light in 1828 and the Encyclop\u00e6dia Metropolitana in 1845.[18]/nDiscoveries of Herschel include the galaxies NGC 7, NGC 10, NGC 25, and NGC 28./nHe declined an offer from the Duke of Sussex that they travel to South Africa on a Navy ship.[citation needed] Herschel had his own inherited money and he paid \u00a3500 for passage on the S.S. Mountstuart Elphinstone. He, his wife, their three children and his 20 inch telescope departed from Portsmouth on 13 November 1833.[1]/nThe voyage to South Africa was made to catalogue the stars, nebulae, and other objects of the southern skies.[6] This was to be a completion as well as extension of the survey of the northern heavens undertaken initially by his father William Herschel. He arrived in Cape Town on 15 January 1834 and set up a private 21\u00a0ft (6.4\u00a0m) telescope at Feldhausen at Claremont, a suburb of Cape Town. Amongst his other observations during this time was that of the return of Comet Halley. Herschel collaborated with Thomas Maclear, the Astronomer Royal at the Cape of Good Hope and the members of the two families became close friends. During this time, he also witnessed the Great Eruption of Eta Carinae (December 1837)./nIn addition to his astronomical work, however, this voyage to a far corner of the British empire also gave Herschel an escape from the pressures under which he found himself in London, where he was one of the most sought-after of all British men of science. While in southern Africa, he engaged in a broad variety of scientific pursuits free from a sense of strong obligations to a larger scientific community. It was, he later recalled, probably the happiest time in his life.[citation needed]/nHerschel combined his talents with those of his wife, Margaret, and between 1834 and 1838 they produced 131 botanical illustrations of fine quality, showing the Cape flora. Herschel used a camera lucida to obtain accurate outlines of the specimens and left the details to his wife. Even though their portfolio had been intended as a personal record, and despite the lack of floral dissections in the paintings, their accurate rendition makes them more valuable than many contemporary collections. Some 112 of the 132 known flower studies were collected and published as Flora Herscheliana in 1996. The book also included work by Charles Davidson Bell and Thomas Bowler.[19]/nAs their home during their stay in the Cape, the Herschels had selected 'Feldhausen' (\"Field Houses\"),[19] an old estate on the south-eastern side of Table Mountain. Here John set up his reflector to begin his survey of the southern skies./nHerschel, at the same time, read widely. Intrigued by the ideas of gradual formation of landscapes set out in Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology, he wrote to Lyell on 20 February 1836 praising the book as a work that would bring \"a complete revolution in [its] subject, by altering entirely the point of view in which it must thenceforward be contemplated\" and opening a way for bold speculation on \"that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others.\" Herschel himself thought catastrophic extinction and renewal \"an inadequate conception of the Creator\" and by analogy with other intermediate causes, \"the origination of fresh species, could it ever come under our cognizance, would be found to be a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process\".[20][21] He prefaced his words with the couplet:/nHe that on such quest would go must know not fear or failing\nTo coward soul or faithless heart the search were unavailing./nTaking a gradualist view of development and referring to evolutionary descent from a proto-language, Herschel commented:/nWords are to the Anthropologist what rolled pebbles are to the Geologist \u2013 battered relics of past ages often containing within them indelible records capable of intelligent interpretation \u2013 and when we see what amount of change 2000 years has been able to produce in the languages of Greece & Italy or 1000 in those of Germany France & Spain we naturally begin to ask how long a period must have lapsed since the Chinese, the Hebrew, the Delaware & the Malesass [Malagasy] had a point in common with the German & Italian & each other \u2013 Time! Time! Time! \u2013 we must not impugn the Scripture Chronology, but we must interpret it in accordance with whatever shall appear on fair enquiry to be the truth for there cannot be two truths. And really there is scope enough: for the lives of the Patriarchs may as reasonably be extended to 5000 or 50000 years apiece as the days of Creation to as many thousand millions of years.[22][23]/nThe document was circulated, and Charles Babbage incorporated extracts in his ninth and unofficial Bridgewater Treatise, which postulated laws set up by a divine programmer.[20] When HMS Beagle called at Cape Town, Captain Robert FitzRoy and the young naturalist Charles Darwin visited Herschel on 3 June 1836. Later on, Darwin would be influenced by Herschel's writings in developing his theory advanced in The Origin of Species. In the opening lines of that work, Darwin writes that his intent is \"to throw some light on the origin of species \u2013 that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers,\" referring to Herschel.  However, Herschel ultimately rejected the theory of natural selection.[24]/nHerschel returned to England in 1838, was created a baronet, of Slough in the County of Buckingham,[6] and published Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope in 1847. In this publication he proposed the names still used today for the seven then-known satellites of Saturn: Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, and Iapetus.[25] In the same year, Herschel received his second Copley Medal from the Royal Society for this work.  A few years later, in 1852, he proposed the names still used today for the four then-known satellites of Uranus: Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. A stone obelisk, erected in 1842 and now in the grounds of The Grove Primary School, marks the site where his 20-ft reflector once stood.[26]/nHerschel made numerous important contributions to photography. He made improvements in photographic processes, particularly in inventing the cyanotype[28] process, which became known as blueprints,[3][4][5] and variations, such as the chrysotype. In 1839, he made a photograph on glass, which still exists, and experimented with some colour reproduction, noting that rays of different parts of the spectrum tended to impart their own colour to a photographic paper. Herschel made experiments using photosensitive emulsions of vegetable juices, called phytotypes, also known as anthotypes, and published his discoveries in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1842.[29]  He collaborated in the early 1840s with Henry Collen, portrait painter to Queen Victoria.  Herschel originally discovered the platinum process on the basis of the light sensitivity of platinum salts, later developed by William Willis.[30]/nHerschel coined the term photography in 1839.[31][32] Herschel was also the first to apply the terms negative and positive to photography.[6]/nHerschel discovered sodium thiosulfate to be a solvent of silver halides in 1819,[33] and informed Talbot and Daguerre of his discovery that this \"hyposulphite of soda\" (\"hypo\") could be used as a photographic fixer, to \"fix\" pictures and make them permanent, after experimentally applying it thus in early 1839./nHerschel's ground-breaking research on the subject was read at the Royal Society in London in March 1839 and January 1840./nHerschel wrote many papers and articles, including entries on meteorology, physical geography and the telescope for the eighth edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.[6] He also translated the Iliad of Homer./nIn 1823, Herschel published his findings on the optical spectra of metal salts.[34]/nHerschel invented the actinometer in 1825 to measure the direct heating power of the Sun's rays,[35] and his work with the instrument is of great importance in the early history of photochemistry./nHerschel proposed a correction to the Gregorian calendar, making years that are multiples of 4000 common years rather than leap years, thus reducing the average length of the calendar year from 365.2425 days to 365.24225.[36] Although this is closer to the mean tropical year of 365.24219 days, his proposal has never been adopted because the Gregorian calendar is based on the mean time between vernal equinoxes (currently 365.242374 days).[37]/nHerschel was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1832,[38] and in 1836, a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences./nIn 1835, the New York Sun newspaper wrote a series of satiric articles that came to be known as the Great Moon Hoax, with statements falsely attributed to Herschel about his supposed discoveries of animals living on the Moon, including batlike winged humanoids./nSeveral locations are named for him: the village of Herschel in western Saskatchewan, Canada, site of the discovery of  Dolichorhynchops herschelensis, a type of plesiosaur; Mount Herschel in Antarctica; the crater J. Herschel on the Moon; and the settlement of Herschel, Eastern Cape and the Herschel Girls' School in Cape Town, South Africa./nWhile it is commonly accepted that Herschel Island, in the Arctic Ocean, part of the Yukon Territory, was named after him, the entries in the expedition journal of Sir John Franklin state that the latter wished to honour the Herschel family, of which John Herschel's father, Sir William Herschel, and his aunt, Caroline Herschel, are as notable as John.[39]/nHerschel married his cousin Margaret Brodie Stewart (1810\u20131884) on 3 March 1829[1] in Edinburgh, and was father of the following children:[40]/nHerschel died on 11 May 1871 at age 79 at Collingwood, his home near Hawkhurst in Kent.  On his death, he was given a national funeral and buried in Westminster Abbey.[41]/nHis obituary by Henry W Field of London was read to the American Philosophical Society on 1 December 1871.[42]/nIn chronological order", "49949264": "Christiaan Johannes (Bob) Entrop (16 November 1917, The Hague - 3 July 1987, The Hague) was a Dutch malacologist./nEntrop was the author of the popular 1959 book Schelpen vinden en herkennen (Thieme - Zutphen, 3e printing 1972, 320 p.) and the booklet Schelpen die men kan vinden. 120 Europese schelpen in kleuren (Thieme - Zutphen, 1975, 72 p.)./nIn 1966 he started a private museum called In de schulp to house his own collection, of over 250,000 shells from 200 families.

She contributed to the field of cancer research by studying the cure for melanoma. Cobb was an advocate for increasing the representation of women and students of color in universities, and she created programs to support students interested in pursuing graduate school.[2]/nJewel Isadora Plummer was the only child of Frank V. Plummer, and Carriebel (Cole) Plummer. Both of her parents used to live in Washington D.C.[3] Her mother, Carriebel, found employment as a physical education[4] and dance teacher who graduated from college with a BA in interpretive dancing. She had re-entered college the same time Jewel enrolled resulting in both mother and daughter earning degrees in the same year.[5] Jewel's father, Frank, was the first Black person to graduate with a Doctor of Medicine from Cornell University, becoming a physician specializing in dermatology.[6] Plummer's paternal grandfather was a freed slave who graduated from Howard University in 1898 making a living as a pharmacist.[7]/nCobb's economically privileged upbringing offered her a childhood of intellectual exploration. From her father's scientific library to her education at several multiracial institutions,[8] Cobb developed an interest in learning from a young age. Although she anticipated becoming a physical education teacher, her interest in science solidified during her sophomore year of high school whilst looking through a microscope in biology class.[9] This interest was encouraged by her biology teacher and she was fascinated by books on microorganisms like Paul DeKruif's The Microbe Hunters.[5]/nCobb matriculated at the University of Michigan in 1942, but, dissatisfied with segregated housing for African-American students at Michigan, she transferred to Talladega College in Alabama.[10] Talladega College did not accept transfer credits, forcing Cobb to start anew. In spite of this, she completed her course work in three years instead of the standard four.[5] She graduated with a BA in biology in 1944[6] and became a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.[4]/nCobb initially was denied a fellowship for graduate study in biology at New York University, allegedly due to her race, but was granted the fellowship after an interview.[4] She earned her MS from New York University in 1947, and her PhD with a focus on cell physiology in 1950[7]/nHer dissertation, Mechanisms of Pigment Formation, examined melanin pigment granules formations in vitro using the enzyme tyrosinase.[11] In 1949, she was appointed an independent investigator at Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory.[4] In 2021, the town renamed a road near the Marine Biological Laboratory \"Jewel Cobb Road\" in honor of Cobb.[12]/nAfter receiving her Ph.D, Cobb became a biology teaching fellow at New York University while also working for the National Cancer Institute at Harlem Hospital (1950-1952)./nFrom 1952-1954 Cobb was an instructor in anatomy in Chicago at the University of Illinois College of Medicine where she taught histology.[4]/nShortly thereafter, Cobb returned to New York, serving as an assistant professor for NYU's post graduate medical school (1955\u201360), while also working as a visiting lecturer at Hunter College (1956\u201357).[13]/nFrom 1960-69, Cobb was employed as head of the biology laboratory at Sarah Lawrence College. While there, she conducted research for participants in the National Science Foundation.[4]/nCobb served as a professor of Zoology and as Dean of Arts and Sciences at Connecticut College from July 1969 until July 1976. Cobb was the first black Dean in the College's history.[14] Upon accepting the position at Connecticut College, she expressed: \"This is a college in transition, moving forward at an exciting pace. We need more black students and teachers to help us formulate and carry out our bold new plans.\"[15]/nDuring her time at Connecticut College, she implemented a Black Scholarship program that provided financial assistance to at least 37 Black undergraduates at the college. The scholarship intended to increase financial assistance needs for students of color.[15] This work inspired similar programs at other universities.[5]/nCobb also established a Fifth Year Post-Baccalaureate Pre-Medical Program, which provided financial assistance and educational opportunities for minority students at the College who wanted to pursue careers in medicine or dentistry. Students were provided with resources for tutoring and counseling. Just five years after this program was established, these students were accepted into graduate programs, which included, Yale, Georgetown, and the University of Connecticut.[14]/nWhile in Connecticut, Dr. Cobb also served as a member of the Lawrence and Memorial Hospital in New London,[16] in addition to being elected Director of the American Council on Education, (1973-1976). Dr Cobb, as member of the National Science Board and advisor to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, chaired a conference of 30 minority women scientists to provide recommendations to schools, policy-makers and the US government on how to recruit more women of color into the sciences. The highly influential report was published as The Double Bind: The Price of Being a Minority Woman in Science./nDue to the many roles, Cobb worked long hours. She did laboratory work in the early morning followed by administrative work before teaching in the afternoons.[5]/nWhile a graduate student, Cobb spent the summer of 1949 as an independent investigator at the Marine Biological Laboratory, where she studied the inhibition of cell division in sea urchin (Arbacia) eggs. This was an early foray into a research interest Cobb would develop extensively in later years: how hormones, ultraviolet light and chemotherapeutic drugs can cause changes in cell division. Cobb\u2019s first summer at MBL as a graduate student  led to a deep connection with Woods Hole, where she eventually bought a second home. She became a MBL Corporation member in 1972 and was a named an emeritus member of the MBL Society in 2007. Cobb was a Library Reader for many years, and also served on the MBL Campaign Steering Committee from 1997 to 2000.[17]/nIn July 1976, Cobb decided to leave Connecticut College and become a dean and professor of Biological Sciences at Douglass Residential College at Rutgers University. Cobb's decision to leave was not premeditated, rather it centered on an interest in becoming a full-time administrator for the Women's division of Rutgers.[18] Cobb's greatest hesitation in leaving the College concerned her inability to continue research to the same degree in her new role.[14]/nWhile at Douglass, Cobb (alongside nine other Americans) was selected by the Rockefeller Foundation to participate in a global conference in Italy concerning the future of higher education for women.[18] Additionally, in April 1978, Cobb was nominated by President Carter as a member of the Board of Foreign Scholarships, best known as the organization responsible for determining Fulbright eligibility./nCobb was appointed President of California State University, Fullerton in 1981 where she began to improve campus facilities from the start of her term./nCobb was successful in obtaining funds for the construction of an Engineering and Computer Science Building which was constructed with state funds, as well as the Ruby Gerontology Center, which was the first building in the College's history to be funded through private donations. She also acquired financial capital for the construction of the first ever student residence on campus. The completion of this apartment complex was later named in her honor. Cobb also negotiated an agreement with the Marriott Corporation and the city of Fullerton for a lease to construct a hotel, allowing her to use available funds for the construction of a campus sports complex. The majority of the planning for the Science Laboratory Center, now called Dan Black Hall, was done while Cobb was president.[19]/nAt Fullerton, some faculty members did not share Cobb's interests in research and rebuilding, holding that the primary mission of the college was to teach. Her decision to enter into the agreement to build the hotel on campus and to add a satellite campus in the southern part of Orange County thus generated criticism on campus. Cobb brought both of these issues to the Faculty Senate for a vote. Both times, her decisions were upheld.[20]/nIn 1990, aged 66, she was forced to retire under a rule imposed by W. Ann Reynolds, the Chancellor of the California State University System, requiring all campus presidents aged 65 or older to retire.[21][22] In response to her departure, Julian Foster, a campus leader and prominent political scientist, expressed Cobb's emphasis on research and scholarship to be her most important contribution to Cal State Fullerton.[23]/nShortly after retiring, Cobb was named California State University Trustee Professor for its Los Angeles division./nIn 1991, she became the principal investigator at Southern California Science and Engineering ACCESS Center and Network, which assists middle school and high school students from disadvantaged backgrounds pursue a future in the fields of science and engineering./nIn 2001, Cobb became the principal investigator for Science Technology Engineering Program (STEP) Up for Youth\u2014ASCEND project at California State University, Los Angeles.[24]  She also was named and served as a member of the Caltech Board of Trustees.[25]/nCobb's research included work on the relationship between melanin and skin damage, and on the effects of hormones, ultraviolet light, and chemotherapy agents on cell division. Cobb discovered that methotrexate was effective in the treatment of certain skin cancers, lung cancers, and childhood leukemia.[26] This drug is still being used in chemotherapy today to give treatment to a variety of cancers and autoimmune diseases which includes: breast cancer, head and neck cancers, lung cancer, leukemia, and some types of lymphoma. Cobb was the first to publish data on actinomycin D and its ability to cause a reduction of nucleoli in the nucleus of normal and malignant human cells.[11]/nShe received a $5,000 grant from the American Cancer Society to continue her research in\"Direct Hormone Action to Human and Mouse Melanomas in Tissue Culture.\"[27] This grant supported her research and a broader examination of pigment cell growth and differentiation in human and mouse melanomas.[28][29]/nOther support for her cancer research came through her post-doctoral fellowship, research grants from the: Damon Runyon, National Science Foundation, National Cancer Institute, and Public Health Services.[14]/nCobb was part of the United States International Cancer congresses in London (1958) and Moscow (1962) and served on the advisory board to Mohegan Community College. She was awarded the National Institute of Health Fellowship for $68,000, where she spent seven months in Naples, Italy continuing cell growth research at the International Laboratory of Genetics and Biophysics.[7]/nThroughout her career, she collaborated with other notable researchers, including oncologist Jane C. Wright, Grace Antikajian, and Dorothy Walker Jones.[10] Her most influential mentors were her bacteriology professor James R. Hayden and her biochemistry professor M.J. Kopac.[11]/nIn recognition of her research achievements, Cobb was elected to the Institute of Medicine in the National Academy of Sciences in 1974.[28]  She was also a member of the National Science Board from 1974 to 1980.[30][31]/nCobb was named Vice President of the Board for the 21st Century Foundation, dedicated to supporting the development of Black institutions that addressed issues in the Black community.[32] Programs established by the organization included: economic, educational, and community development with the purpose of creating opportunities for people of color.[8]/nShe was also a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which supported both women and people of color in the field.[16] Cobb was one of seven recognized by the Oakland Museum Association's Cultural and Ethnic Affairs for her contributions to science and/or technology. The museum's exhibition hoped to increase minority representation in the sciences by showcasing the accomplishments of people of color, including several of Cobb's findings.[33]/nAs the keynote speaker at the 1971 Wheaton College commencement, Cobb called for an alliance between the Women's Liberation Movement and the Black Liberation Movement.[34][35] She called for the equality of women, the abolition of abortion laws, and the demand for public child care in particular.[35]/nMany of the policies and programs Cobb initiated during her administrative careers take form in her 1979 paper, Filters for Women in Science, where she expressed concerns about female representation in science and engineering. Through an analogy connecting her passion for science and demand for equity, Cobb claimed that the characteristics of the filtrate passing through a filter are primarily determined by the size of the pores, which she connected with the limitations of female employment in science.[36]/nCobb's insistence on providing resources and programs to increase minority representation at her colleges of employment define her legacy outside of the laboratory.[2]/nA former student, Timothy Yarboro, stated,  \"I would not have become a doctor. Because of her, I knew it was possible.\"[37]/nCobb resided in Maplewood, New Jersey,[37] until her death on January 1, 2017, at the age of 92.[35][2] She was survived by her only child, Jonathan, a radiologist specializing in magnetic resonance imaging.[8]", "21015133": "Maxine Frank Singer (born February 15, 1931) is an American molecular biologist and science administrator.[1]  She is known for her contributions to solving the genetic code, her role in the ethical and regulatory debates on recombinant DNA techniques (including the organization of the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA), and her leadership of Carnegie Institution of Washington.\nIn 2002, Discover magazine recognized her as one of the 50 most important women in science.[2]/nSinger was born in New York City.[3]  After attending Midwood High School in Brooklyn,[4] she majored in chemistry (and minored in biology) at Swarthmore College.[5]  She went on to earn a Ph.D. in 1957 at Yale University, researching protein chemistry under Joseph Fruton.  Fruton encouraged her to specialize in nucleic acids, and in 1956 she joined the Laboratory of Biochemistry of Leon Heppel at the National Institutes of Health.[6]  She led various biochemical research groups as the Chief of the Laboratory of Biochemistry at the National Cancer institute between 1980 and 1987.[7]/nIn the wake of the 1973 report of the first use of recombinant DNA techniques to introduce genes from one species into another, Singer was among the first to call attention to the possible risks of genetic engineering.  She was a chairperson of the 1973 Gordon Conference on Nucleic Acids, where the possible public health risks of the technique were discussed,[8] and she helped to organize the 1975 Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA that resulted in guidelines for dealing with the largely unknown risks of the technique.[1]/nSinger was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978.[9] In 1988, she became president of Carnegie Institution of Washington, a position she held until 2002.[10] She was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1990.[11] Singer received the National Medal of Science in 1992 \"for her outstanding scientific accomplishments and her deep concern for the societal responsibility of the scientist\"[12] and was the first woman to receive the Vannevar Bush Award, in 1999.[13] In 2007, she was awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences.[14]/nSinger has made important contributions to the fields of biochemistry and molecular biology. Her research with Leon Heppel on the role of enzymes that regulate synthesis of nucleic acids played a part in helping Marshall Nirenberg and Heinrick Matthaei in deciphering the genetic code.[15] They studied polynucleotide phosphorylase, an enzyme that can put together individual nucleotides into random RNA sequences. They investigated the base compositions of these polynucleotides using electrophoresis and paper chromatography, which enabled them to understand how the enzyme catalyzed their synthesis.[15] These experiments also allowed them to create a library of artificial RNA strands of defined sequences, such as a molecule made of only triplets of uracil that would code for phenylalanine. These artificial polynucleotides were used by Nirenberg to support the hypothesis that RNA plays a key role in the synthesis of proteins using information from DNA. The specific RNA sequences that Singer produced were used to match each of the twenty amino acids to a specific RNA nucleotide triplet, .[15]/nSinger's research also includes the study of chromatin structure and genetic recombination of viruses. During her time as the head of the Laboratory of Biochemistry at the National Cancer Institute in the 1980s, she focused her research on LINEs, or long interspersed nucleotide elements.[15] She focused on LINE-1, a retrotransposon found in mammalian genomes that is scattered in thousands of places in the human genome, which she concluded is capable of movement and insertion into new places on the chromosomal DNA.[16] She studied the mechanism of how LINE-1 replicates and disperses copies to new locations of the genome, and found that the insertion of these elements into a new location could induce mutations in nearby genes, playing a role in genetic disease.[15]/nBesides her scientific research, Singer has been influential in refining science policy. When she was the co-chair of the Gordon Conference in 1973, she raised concerns over the potential health effects and risks in the relatively new field of recombinant DNA technology.[7] She organized the 1975 Asilomar conference in order to bring together scientists to impose restrictions and draw guidelines on recombinant DNA research, where she recommended resumption of research under cautious safeguards until more was known about the potential biohazards of recombinant DNA technology.[17][18]/nSinger is also an advocate for women in science. She wrote an editorial in Science arguing that universities should encourage women pursuing science and engineering rather than wasting their skills due to unintentional bias against them.[19] Singer also introduced the \"First Light\" project, a science education program for elementary school students in Washington, D.C. aiming to improve mathematics and science education in schools.[7]/nSinger has written over 100 scientific papers, and has also published several books with co-author Paul Berg intended to help the public have a better understanding of molecular genetics, including Genes and Genomes (1991), Dealing with Genes (1993), and George Beadle: An Uncommon Farmer (2003).[18] In 2018 she published Blossoms: And the Genes that Make Them, which describes the genetic and evolutionary reasons that flowers bloom.[20]", "29338205": "Karl Fedorovich Kessler (19 November 1815 \u2013 3 March 1881) was a Baltic German zoologist who worked as a professor of biology at Saint Petersburg Imperial University. Among his contributions was the idea that evolution at an infraspecific level involved mutual aid and that Charles Darwin had placed too much emphasis on competition which he accepted as occurring at the interspecies level./nKessler was born in Damrau, Konigsberg where his father was a royal forester (oberforestmeister). His father moved to Novgorod Governorate where Kessler grew up. In 1828 he joined the Third Saint Petersburg Gymnasium\u00a0[ru] with a scholarship and went to Saint Petersburg Imperial University in 1834. He attended the zoology lectures of Stepan Kutorga. After graduation he worked as a school mathematics teacher. In 1837, Kessler and his botanist friend from student days, Nikolai Zheleznov\u00a0[ru] went on an expedition to Finland. In 1840 he defended a master's dissertation on the legs of birds in relation to systematics. In 1842, his doctoral dissertation was on the skeleton of woodpeckers in relation to their classification. He then obtained a zoology chair at the University of Kyiv, a position vacated by Alexander von Middendorff who went to Siberia on an expedition. Kessler collected and examined numerous taxa across the region. He conducted most of his studies of birds in Ukrainian regions of the Russian Empire: Kiev Governorate, Volyn Governorate, Kherson Governorate, Poltava Governorate and Bessarabia. He also studied the fish of the Dniester, Dnieper, and Southern Bug rivers, and on the Ukrainian coast of the Black Sea.[1] Based on the fish fauna, he hypothesized that several of the lakes in the region were earlier connected. He suggested that the Black and Caspian Seas had separated early and that the  Black Sea and the Mediterranean had been connected by streams. Thus he was among the early zoogeographers.[2] In 1862, he replaced Stepan Kutorga at Saint Petersburg Imperial University. Here he established a zoology department. A year after the first congress of Russian naturalists and doctors, he founded the Saint Petersburg Society of Naturalists\u00a0[ru] in 1868, and in an address to the society in 1879 he proposed that mutual aid, rather than mutual struggle, was the main factor in the evolution of a species. The anarchist Peter Kropotkin later developed this theory in his book Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution./nNumerous species have been named after Kessler including Kessler's gudgeon (Romanogobio kesslerii), Ponticola kessleri, Barbus kessleri,  and Turdus kessleri.[3]/nMedia related to Karl Kessler at Wikimedia Commons/n/nThis biographical article about a Russian scientist is a stub.

He also was the editor of the University of Texas's Publications of the Institute of Marine Science from 1950 to 1955[2][3] and founded the publication Contributions to Marine Science.[4]/nIn 1955, Gunter left Texas to become director of the University of Southern Mississippi\u2032s Gulf Coast Research Laboratory in Ocean Springs, Mississippi,[3] a position he assumed on September 1, 1955.[4] At the time, the laboratory was merely a part-time summer school teaching facility with one full-time scientist (a marine biologist) and two part-time support personnel making up its entire paid staff[2][4] and a physical plant that was so limited that students often worked and studied outdoors.[4] Gunter had a vision of the laboratory becoming a major research center for the study of marine biology and fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico; he set about fulfilling that vision, and he is best known for his tenure at the laboratory.[1][3] During its 16 years with Gunter as its director, the laboratory experienced tremendous growth in the size of its scientific staff, its educational efforts, and its physical plant.[2] The laboratory's first project under Gunter's direction funded by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service was a study of the life cycle of the menhaden published in 1958,[4] and much of the significant early fisheries research in the northern Gulf of Mexico took place under his direct supervision as director.[2]/nGunter was an avid and voracious reader and believed strongly in keeping up to date on current professional literature,[3] and on September 1, 1955,[5] as one of his first initiatives as director, he established a research library at the laboratory for use by faculty, staff, visiting scientists, and students.[2][3][4][5] The library began as a collection of books and reprints in Gunter's office,[4] and he built its collection almost singlehandedly,[2] purchasing and donating to it many of the early volumes in its collection.[3] In April 1961[4] he established the publication Gulf Research Reports[2][4] \u2013 renamed Gulf and Caribbean Research in 2002[4] \u2013 which he described as \"...devoted primarily to publication of the data of the Marine Sciences, chiefly of the Gulf of Mexico and adjacent waters.\"[2] He also used Gulf Research Reports as a means of further building the laboratory's library, trading issues of the publication for scientific journals to add to the library's collection,[3][4] and the library became arguably the premier marine library on the U.S. Gulf Coast.[2][3] In 1963, a full-time professional staff began working at the library, by 1971 it took up a third of the ground floor of one of the laboratory's buildings, and by May 2010 its collection exceeded 27,000 volumes.[4]/nAfter he arrived in 1955, Gunter oversaw a construction program to give the laboratory far more extensive and modern facilities. His tenure saw the construction of the laboratory's oceanography building, a 40-room brick dormitory, the anadromous fisheries building (destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in 2005), the research building, the Caylor Building, and a maintenance shop, as well as the rebuilding of the Hopkins teaching laboratory (destroyed by Hurricane Camille in 1969). The 65-foot (20-meter) research vessel Gulf Researcher also was constructed for the laboratory while he was the director.[4] Gunter also pursued other goals to build a significant research program at the laboratory, including the recruitment of high-quality personnel, developing a network of affiliated colleges and universities to enhance the summer field program by bringing in students from other universities and other states, the founding of a museum, and championing the laboratory and its work to state university presidents and the members of the Board of Trustees of the Institutes of Higher Learning of the State of Mississippi, the Mississippi Legislature, and the Mississippi Academy of Sciences.[4]/nGunter was an early advocate of aquaculture,[3] and he foresaw an industry involving the mariculture of shrimp eventually growing along the U.S. Gulf Coast.[2] In 1968, although no advanced technology for the farming of shrimp yet existed, Gunter created and led one of the first research teams \u2013 a handpicked staff of physiologists \u2013 to look into the development of artificial shrimp feed for use in raising shrimp in commercial aquaculture.[2][3] His pioneering work helped lead to a burgeoning shrimp-farming industry along the U.S. Gulf Coast by the mid-1980s.[2]/nIn addition to furthering the interests of the laboratory, Gunter found time to conduct his research.[4] Investigating oyster mortality in the Gulf of Mexico, Gunter conducted research that aided in identifying the parasitic protist Dermocystidium marinum, later renamed Perkinsus marinus, the pathogen causing the disease perkinsosis, also known as dermo, in oysters.[3]/nGunter saw an understanding of the effects of the Mississippi River on the biology of fisheries in the north-central Gulf of Mexico as essential to understanding and managing fisheries resources in the area, and he supported the idea of a large, 20-to-25-year effort by a multidisciplinary team of scientists to discover and assess the river's impact.[2] As the sole expert consultant to the United States Army Corps of Engineers in Mississippi for several years, he researched the paleogeography of the Mississippi River and projected the course of the river if the Corps of Engineers did not engage in flood control and other efforts designed to modify the river's behavior. He concluded that without the work of the Corps of Engineers, the Atchafalaya River increasingly would capture the waters of the Mississippi, that the two rivers would be of equal size by 2038, and that the Mississippi eventually would cease to flow past New Orleans, and instead would turn westward to flow down to the Gulf of Mexico down the course of the Atchafalaya, entering the Gulf of Mexico near Morgan City, Louisiana.[2][3] Colleagues credited Gunter with being instrumental in urging the Corps of Engineers to require environmental impact statements.[4]/nGunter also saw the laboratory through Hurricane Camille, which struck during the night of August 17\u201318, 1969, flooding its grounds with a storm surge that reached a depth of 18.5 feet (5.6 meters). Although its research vessels rode out the storm safely, the laboratory suffered the destruction of about half of its buildings \u2013 three of brick construction and four wooden ones \u2013 and severe damage to its wooden dining hall.[4] Gunter told the students at the laboratory to go home the day after the storm because of the destruction of the facilities necessary to accommodate them, which he described as \"one if the sadder duties of my life.\"[4]/nGunter stepped down as director of the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory in 1971, but he continued to work at the laboratory as professor of zoology and director emeritus until 1979 when he retired from active service to the state government of Mississippi at the age of 70. By the time of his retirement, the laboratory had grown tremendously from what it had been when he arrived in 1955, becoming a major marine research center.

He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and served as president of several biology societies./nMarkert was born in Las Animas, Colorado and raised in Pueblo, Colorado.  He attended the University of Colorado, and in 1937, left college to fight in the Spanish Civil War\u2014stowing away aboard a freighter to circumvent government travel restrictions.  After returning to college, Markert completed his bachelor's degree in 1940; upon graduation, he married Margaret Rempfer, and they moved to UCLA for graduate work.[1]  He enrolled in the United States Merchant Marine to take part in World War II; by 1954 they had three children. After the war, he finished a master's degree at UCLA followed by a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University in 1948.[2]/nMarkert's Ph.D. research, and subsequent postdoctoral work at Caltech, focused on the sexuality and other physiological and genetic aspects of Glomerella, a genus of pathogenic plant fungi.  At Caltech, he also worked with George Beadle on corn and Neurospora genetics.[1]/nIn 1950 he began teaching at the University of Michigan, part of the new wave of what later became molecular biology. In 1954, Markert became a victim of McCarthyism; he was suspended from teaching because he refused to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee.  He was later reinstated, and continued at the University of Michigan until moving to Johns Hopkins in 1957, followed by Yale University\u2014as head of the Department of Biology.[3]  In 1966, he served as president of the American Institute of Biological Sciences.[4]  He remained at Yale until retiring in 1986 to North Carolina State University, where he continued researching until 1993.[5]/nEarly in his career, Markert developed the concept of isozymes based on electrophoresis and histochemical staining of enzymes.  He found that often what had been assumed to be a single enzyme catalyzing a specific reaction was in fact multiple enzymes, with different proteins present in different tissues.  In biochemistry, this forced a re-evaluation of some basic assumptions of enzyme kinetics; in genetics, it contributed to the shift from the \"one gene-one enzyme hypothesis\" to the \"one gene-one polypeptide\" concept.  Markert's early work with isozymes, many of which are formed by gene duplication, was a precursor to the concept of gene families.  Markert's later career focused on developmental biology, particularly developmental genetics in experiments with mosaic animals.[1]/nMarkert was Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Experimental Zoology from 1963 to 1985.[6]  He also edited the Journal of Developmental Biology.[1]/nIn 1990, the University of Michigan created the annual \"Davis, Markert, Nickerson Lecture on Academic and Intellectual Freedom\" series, in honor of Markert and two other Michigan faculty suspended for refusing to testify in 1954.[7]/nIn 1992, it was reported in National Geographic that Markert was attempting an experiment to create a \"superpig\" by crossbreeding the extremely fertile Meishan pig  with domestic pigs, speeding up the process by altering the genes of fertilized embryos.[8] It was hoped that this would, within 5 years of beginning the program, create a hybrid that combined the fertility and early sexual maturation of the Meishan pig with the lean physique and quick growing times of domestic pigs.", "59026070": "JoAnn Trejo is an American pharmacologist, cell biologist, a professor, and also an assistant vice chancellor in the department of health sciences faculty affairs in the Department of Pharmacology at the School of Medicine at University of California, San Diego.[1][2]  She is also the assistant vice chancellor for Health Sciences Faculty Affairs.[3] Trejo studies cell signalling by protease-activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).[4][5][6] She is also actively involved in mentoring, education and outreach activities to increase the diversity of science.[7][8]/nTrejo grew up the youngest of five children in a single-parent household.[9] Trejo obtained her bachelor's of science in toxicology and biochemistry from University of California, Davis in 1986.[10][11] She earned her PhD and MBA at University of California, San Diego in 1992 and 2015, respectively.[10][11]/nTrejo completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco.[10] In 2000, she joined the faculty at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.[10] In 2008, she was recruited to University of California, San Diego as a tenured faculty member and was promoted to full professor in 2012.

His undergraduate thesis was focused on cortisol timing release.[2] He then studied at Stanford University, where he received his Ph.D. in neuro- and bio-behavioral sciences in 1978 and his M.D. in 1981.[3] As a graduate student at Stanford, Czeisler continued his research in Dr. William Dement's lab.[3][2] Dr. Elliot Weitzman, who both worked with and mentored Czeisler, influenced Czeisler to study sleep.[3][2] Today, Czeisler is the Baldino Professor of Sleep Medicine and Director of the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School. Additionally, he works as the Division Chief of Sleep Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.[3][4]/nCzeisler has spent over 40 years researching the relationship between light and human physiology, particularly, the physiology of the human circadian clock.  He teaches a course at Harvard College on Circadian Biology for undergraduate and graduate students.[3][5] He was ultimately inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa Society (\u03a6\u0392\u039a) at Harvard College in 1999. In addition to his work at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Czeisler is a Diplomate of the American Board of Sleep Medicine, an elected member of the National Academy of Medicine, the International Academy of Astronautics and the American Clinical and Climatological Association, and a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, American Society for Clinical Investigation, and Association of American Physicians.[3]/nCzeisler was one of Tibor Czeisler and Wanda Victoria Murzyn's three children.[1] In 1993, Czeisler married Theresa Lynn Shanahan M.D. They now have three children and live in the Boston area.[1] In his free time, Czeisler enjoys swimming, playing pickleball, and slalom waterskiing.[1]/nCzeisler's research focus is the neurobiology of human circadian rhythm, the functions and physiology of sleep, the epidemiology and public health consequences of sleep disorders, and the applications of circadian and sleep principles in clinical medicine and occupational safety and health. He also examines the relationship between the circadian oscillator and sleep homeostasis, including a landmark 1980 Science paper demonstrating that sleep episodes were correlated with the circadian phase of the body temperature rhythm at bedtime and not with the length of prior wakefulness.[6] Czeisler's research interests encompass many areas, including the effects of light on human circadian rhythms, the role of sleep and circadian rhythms in metabolism, the impact of shift work on health and productivity, and the effects of melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists on humans./nCzeisler investigates how the physiological system works to reset the human central circadian pacemaker, located in the hypothalamus and called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).[7] Among his most salient contributions to this research area are a pair of seminal Science original research articles published in 1986[8] and 1989.[9] The first, entitled \"Bright light resets the human circadian pacemaker independent of the timing of the sleep-wake cycle,\" provided convincing evidence that light influences the human circadian pacemaker, contributing to control of daily variations in physiologic, behavioral, and cognitive function. This finding challenged the then-common idea that synchronization to the 24-hour day accomplished either through social contacts or the sleep-wake schedule. This scientific breakthrough was featured on the front page of The New York Times in June 1989./nCzeisler then led the discovery that light transduced by non-visual input (melanopsin activation) could reset the circadian clock in patients without sight.[10][11] This indicated that some blind humans can entrain to light through non-visual photoreceptors. Czeisler found that intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) influence both the circadian clock and visual perception, indicating that ipRGCs contribute to \"visual\" light perception even in the absence of rod and cone photoreceptors.[12] Significantly, this challenged the misconception that rod and cone photoreceptors were the sole receptors for photo-entrainment in humans.[13][14] In 2002, Czeisler published a study that defended the long-held notion that mammals do not have extra-occular photoreceptors.[15][16] The findings of his study definitively refuted those of the famous 1998 Science publication, \"Extraocular Circadian Phototransduction in Humans,\" which had reported that bright light behind the knees can help regulated human circadian photoentrainment.[17] Czeisler's study debunked the 1998 publication./nCzeisler has examined the effects of sleep deprivation on the sleep-wake cycle and circadian rhythms, and how this impacts attention performance.[7][18]  He found that bright light duration impacts the circadian pacemaker, melatonin suppression, and sleepiness.[19][13] He has also discovered that even room lighting can suppress melatonin production and its duration.[20] Czeisler has also dedicated a portion of his career to examining the effects of light timing, duration, intensity, and wavelength on resetting the pacemaker through ipRGCs, which contain the photopigment melanopsin.[13][14]/nCzeisler's work has many important applications. He showed that sleep deprivation could have adverse consequences affecting obesity and diabetes, among other health problems.[19][13][21] He has also investigated the effects of chronic sleep deprivation and restriction, night shifts, and circadian disruption, on neurobehavioral performance and metabolism.[7][13][21][22] Furthermore, Czeisler studied how sleep deprivation impairs the psychomotor performance of night shift workers (2009-2014),[19] specifically surgeons (2009-2013)[22] and residents (2010), police officers (2004-2008),[23] and truck drivers (2012). Other research interests of his include studying wakefulness, sleep deprivation and how it can be prevented, and such influences on the clock as exercise and age.[19] Czeisler's research has been applied to medicine, space travel, and night occupations including shift-work.[7][22]/nAs of August 2023, Czeisler has published more than 300 scientific articles, which have accumulated more than 80,000 citations, leading to an h-index of 138.[24]/nIn a 1999 interview with the Harvard Gazette regarding his team's characterization of a near-24-hour human circadian period, Czeisler noted that \"accepting the near-24-hour period means that all the ideas about daily human rhythms that we take for granted must be rethought.\"[39] Understanding the internal circadian period makes problems dealing with jet-lag, night shifts, and sleep schedules in orbit more approachable/nGuided by the significant real-life implications of his research, Czeisler is a strong advocate for healthy sleep habits. In consulting with the Boston Celtics, Portland Trail Blazers, and Minnesota Timberwolves for the National Basketball Association (NBA) and Cleveland Browns for the National Football League (NFL), he emphasized sleep as the \"third pillar of health\" alongside nutrition and exercise.[40] He instituted structural changes to the teams' schedules to allow for healthier sleep habits, including pushing morning practices into the afternoon and the '2 a.m. rule' which prevents players from traveling if they are going to arrive at their hotel later than 2:00 am.[40][41]/nAccording to Czeisler, sleep deficiency poses a significant individual and public health hazard as demonstrated by the significant contribution of drowsiness to workplace accidents and motor vehicle accidents. In an interview with the Harvard Business Review, he explains that companies should seek to address this problem by setting behavioral expectations and scheduling policies for employees to avoid accruing sleep deficit.[42]/nIn order to implement improved occupational sleep scheduling and sleep health standards as effective public policy, Czeisler has served on and consulted to numerous national and international health advisory agencies. As President of the National Sleep Foundation from 2005\u20132006, he chaired the Presidential Task Force on Sleep and Public Policy in order to develop model legislation regarding physician-in-training work hours.[3][43][44] As a Team Leader of the Human Performance Factors, Sleep and Chronobiology Team at the NASA National Space Biomedical Research Institute, Czeisler has been responsible for developing sleep-wake schedule guidelines for NASA astronauts and mission control personnel.[3]/nCzeisler is also a member of the Brigham Health Sleep Matters Initiative,(SMI) which was created \"to implement evidence-based clinical treatments for sleep and circadian disorders, and to change the culture of sleep.\" In 2018, the National Safety Council recognized the SMI for its outstanding commitment to safety, for which it was awarded the prestigious Green Cross for Safety Award.[45]/nIn 2018, Czeisler penned a powerful Perspective in The New England Journal of Medicine entitled \"Housing Immigrant Children - The Inhumanity of Constant Illumination\"[46] in which he harshly criticized the constant light exposure to which children were being subjected in detention centers while awaiting immigration processing, as this did not allow for exposure to light-dark cycles central to circadian regulation./nIn 2023, together with Harvard Medical School Professor Elizabeth Klerman, Czeisler organized a seminar at the Harvard Radcliffe Institute to discuss whether daylight saving time should be eliminated or made permanent\u2014a debate they call \u201canother clash between scientific evidence and politics.\u201d The seminar brought together researchers, policymakers, and members of the general public for a discussion./nA more complete listing of agencies to which Czeisler has consulted[46] can be found at his Harvard Faculty Profile.[47]/nCzeisler's research in sleep medicine, circadian rhythms, and professional advocacy for occupational health and safety, are the subject of various honors and awards included below:/nCzeisler is a co-inventor of several U.S. patents:/nDuring October 2019, a Festschrift was organized to celebrate Czeisler's career.

At the June 23\u201328, 2019 Gordon Research Conference, \u201cClocks in Model Organisms: Circadian Networks, Physiology and Health,\u201d she is organizing the \u201cGRC Power Hour,\u201d a panel designed to promote diversity and inclusion for women and minorities in the STEM field as well as encourage the professional growth of all members from all communities by providing a space for discussion and mentorship.[4]/nGreen was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming on May 14, 1962. After spending some time in Wyoming with her mother during her early years, Green's family moved frequently\u2014first to Denver, Colorado; then to Saint Paul, Minnesota; and finally to Springfield, Missouri when she was in first grade. She remained in Springfield throughout her adolescence before attending Southwest Missouri State University, where she graduated in 1984 with a bachelor's degree in biology. Remaining at Southwest Missouri State, she also received her master's degree in biology in 1986. After receiving her master's, Green left Springfield to attend the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, where she received her Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology working with Simon Kwok. From 1991-1996, she was a Postdoctoral Fellow with Joseph Besharse in the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology at the University of Kansas Medical Center, where she worked on the molecular mechanisms of circadian rhythmicity in the retinal photoreceptors of Xenopus laevis. In 1997 she joined the faculty in the Department of Biology at the University of Virginia, continuing her work on circadian rhythms in both Xenopus and mammals. More specifically, she studied the molecular and cellular mechanisms that comprise and regulate the circadian oscillator in vertebrates./nGreen was first exposed to chronobiology when she was a graduate student at the University of Kansas Medical Center. At the time, she had not been working on the subject, but heard a seminar by Joseph Besharse, who had just been recruited to the University as the new Chair of Cell Biology in 1989. She had been finishing up her Ph.D. degree and was looking for postdoctoral positions in Kansas City. When Green heard about the novel field of circadian clocks, this intrigued her. Besharse had been speaking about his work on the endogenous clock in the retinas of Xenopus. In those days, nothing was known about the molecular mechanism of circadian clocks in any system. She had been trained as a biochemist and molecular biologist, and thought that this field would be a perfect place to use her skills to work on such a fascinating biological anomaly. Besharse hired her as a postdoctoral student in his lab and she has been studying circadian clocks ever since./nGreen is married to Joseph Takahashi, who is the current chair of the Department of Neuroscience at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center./nGreen is currently a principal investigator in the Department of Neuroscience at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Her lab studies the molecular mechanism of circadian rhythms in mammals, with a specific interest in the regulatory mechanisms that modulate translational and post-transcriptional processes. The Green Lab is currently focused on understanding the circadian function of Nocturnin, the circadian regulation of metabolism, and the circadian structure and function of Cryptochrome\u2019s core components./nA major focus in the Green lab has been on a protein encoded by the Nocturnin gene, named for its high-level nighttime expression. Nocturnin is a deadenylase thought to be involved in the degradation of mRNA polyA tails, suggesting that it plays a role in post-transcriptional stability and regulation of circadian gene expression, which is most beneficial to the metabolism and ultimately, survival of an organism.[5]/nIn 1996, Green discovered nocturnin (Noc) in the retinal photoreceptors of Xenopus laevis, where Noc mRNA displayed rhythmic expression in an isolated Xenopus eye in light/dark and constant conditions. They isolated this gene by using a high stringency differential display screen for rhythmic genes in the Xenopus retina. In 2001, Green found Noc homologues in other species such as mice with a high degree coding sequence similarity. Since expanding these studies into mice, they have shown that mouse Nocturnin mRNA is also rhythmic and expressed in many circadian clock-containing tissues. Interestingly, Green's group has shown that though Noc is not directly involved in regulating the master clock gene expression, it is required for oscillator output functions thereby contributing to circadian physiology.[6]/nThe rhythmic expression of nocturnin (Noc) is seen throughout the body, notably in tissues crucial for metabolism like the liver and intestine. In 2011, Green, Douris, and others were able to show differing Noc phenotypes have emerged implicating involvement of this gene in osteogenesis, lipogenesis, and adipogenesis.[7]/nHer lab's current research focuses on identifying Nocturnin's circadian-relevant mRNA targets and understanding how it goes about regulating their expression.[8]/nIn 2011, Green's lab concluded that transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes are necessary to generate robust circadian rhythms of mRNA expression, but understandings of circadian post-transcriptional mechanisms lag far behind understandings of clock regulation at the transcriptional level. This was found to be due to the lack of well-developed methodologies to find post-transcriptionally regulated genes on a large scale. The authors believe that development of such methods is likely to lead to the discovery of many more genes and mechanisms that are under post-transcriptional control.[9]/nGreen's findings are cited in more recent developments on post-transcriptional control of the mammalian circadian clock. Recent findings in 2016 inspired by Green's research contribute to post-transcriptional control of human circadian systems in relation to chronomedicine and sleep disorders.[10]/nGreen's lab has focused heavily on a class of proteins known as cryptochromes, which are blue light receptor proteins found in both plants and animals. Cryptochrome proteins are essential for the proper functioning of the circadian clock in insects and mammals, and for proper development in plants.[11] Cryptoproteins regulate the circadian clocks of plants, insects, and mammals in different ways. Green has worked extensively with an amphibian, the African clawed frog (or Xenopus laevis), as well as mammalian CRY1 and CRY2, to try and uncover the mysteries of these essential transcriptional repressors.[12]/nGreen's research on cryptochromes began in 2003, when she and colleagues investigated the role of cryptochrome in suppressing the activation of other circadian clock genes such as CLOCK and BMAL1. They revealed that the deletion of Cryptochrome's C-terminal domain resulted in proteins unable to suppress activation of these genes. This result indicates that the C-terminal is not the domain of suppression of CLOCK/BMAL1, but is essential only for nuclear localization.[13][14]/nGreen has also studied the relationship between the suprachiasmatic nucleus and peripheral circadian oscillators, in which cryptochrome plays a key role. The regulatory region of Cry1, for instance, contains a response region for the Glucocorticoid hormone , such that input of this hormone can activate transcription of Cry1. In Cry1/Cry2 null mice, regular feeding at 24 hour intervals can induce circadian expression of many transcripts, especially those related to metabolism. This shows how peripheral oscillators can bypass the usual circadian feedback loops of the central oscillator.[15]/nMore recently, in 2018, Green contributed to the discovery of a new co-factor which mediates regulation through direct interaction with CLOCK and BMAL1. This study provides a model for the evolutionary mechanism by which the structure of cryptochromes, and thus clock regulatory mechanisms, varies.[16]", "59484865": "Rasmus Nielsen (born January 27, 1970)[2] is a Danish biologist and professor in the Department of Integrative Biology at the University of California, Berkeley.

This analysis involved examination of several trillion bacterial cells, and showed that clones from later generations had significantly increased rates of mutation to Cit+, indicating that evolution of the trait in the population was contingent upon a history in which \"potentiating\" mutations accumulated that made it mutationally accessible. Later genomic analysis of clones from the population established the immediate genetic and biochemical basis of the Cit+ trait to be a tandem duplication mutation that placed a silent citrate transporter gene under the control of a new promoter that caused its expression when oxygen is present, an example of promoter capture and gene exaptation.[8][9] Based on these findings, Blount proposed a model for the evolution of complex traits: 1. potentiation, in which mutations that make the trait evolutionarily accessible accumulate, 2. actualization, in which a mutation produces a phenotypic switch in which the new trait is manifested, and 3. refinement, in which natural selection accumulates subsequent mutations that make the new trait more effective.[10]/nCurrently, Blount is further investigating how complex traits evolve, how novel traits impact ecology, and how speciation occurs in asexual populations based on models proposed by Fredrick Cohan of Wesleyan University.[11]", "14559955": "Ove Hoegh-Guldberg (born 26 September 1959, in Sydney, Australia), is a biologist and climate scientist specialising in coral reefs, in particular bleaching due to global warming and climate change.

In addition to still unraveling neuronal mechanisms of circadian clocks and their applications to health, Meijer's lab now studies the effects of modern lifestyles on our circadian rhythm and bodily functions./nMeijer attended Leiden University in the Netherlands, where she obtained her master's degree in the Department of Biology, Physics, and Medicine and her Ph.D. in Physiology. After completing her Ph.D. in 1989, Meijer became an assistant professor in the Department of Physiology at Leiden University in 1992. Here, Meijer began her work on circadian rhythms alongside  Ben Rusak. In 2001, Meijer became an associate professor at Leiden University./nMeijer continues her study of circadian rhythms and chronobiology today as a Professor and Head of Neurophysiology Group at the Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands and a visiting professor in the Department of Ophthalmology at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.[2]/nMeijer is a major contributor to the topic of circadian clocks and neuronal organization. She discovered that synaptic and neural plasticity in the neuronal network of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is required for regular seasonal adaptation of the circadian clock in animals.[3] It was shown that in mammals, the functional integrity of the SCN is crucial to health, well-being, cognitive performance, and alertness. Aging and sleep deprivation both result in a decrease in circadian amplitude, while activities such as exercise result in an increase in the circadian amplitude.[4] This paper discusses how the effects of aging and sleep deprivation negatively impact the SCN and work to degrade its functional integrity./nAdditionally, Meijer and colleagues demonstrated the mechanisms behind synchronization and plasticity of the SCN circadian pacemaker which allows the circadian clock to respond to changes in the length of day. Meijer found that SCN synchronization improves with exercise and worsens with age and sleep deprivation.[4][5] Studying plasticity further, Meijer and other scientists discovered that plasticity has effects on metabolism. Specifically, they found that a phase shift in one's circadian clock due to different patterns of light exposure results in metabolic disorders and obesity.[6]/nMeijer's studies of cryptochrome-deficient mice  (a photoreceptor which regulates entrainment by light) revealed that they show no neuronal activity in the SCN because the circadian rhythm is generated from a transcription-translation feedback loop, which includes both positive and negative feedback via certain circadian clock genes.[7]/nApplying techniques in neurophysiology to the study of circadian systems, Meijer pioneered the use of in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological recordings to characterize the neural basis of circadian light responses in the mammalian SCN. Meijer's early studies in rodents used direct electrical recordings to map the prevalence and properties of visual SCN neurons in response to retinal light exposure.[8] Meijer went on to characterize the baseline and light-induced activity of the mammalian SCN through long-term recordings in freely moving rats, which established the ability of the SCN to produce circadian rhythms in neural activity in vivo.[9][10]/nStudying pathways for light input to the SCN, Meijer found that glutamate injections in the SCN produce phase shifts in the circadian activity rhythms of hamsters similar to those induced by light exposure, providing evidence that glutamate transmission mediates photic entrainment.[11] Building upon this finding, Meijer later demonstrated the presence of glutamate receptors within the retinohypothalamic tract of brown Norwegian rats through the use of immunogold labeling, providing molecular evidence that glutamate acts as a neurotransmitter in the transduction of photic signals to the circadian clock.[5]/nProbing the role of classical photoreceptors in photic entrainment, Meijer's lab demonstrated that light-dependent activation of the SCN was retained in mice lacking the photopigment melanopsin (Opn4-/-) but strongly attenuated in mice lacking rods and cones (rd/rd cl).[5] Previously, melanopsin expressed in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells was thought to be the primary photopigment involved in light input to the circadian clock.[5] As such, these results offered evidence for the role of classical photoreceptors in transmitting light information to the SCN, which showed that the mammalian circadian clock receives input from photopigments beyond melanopsin.[5]/nMeijer's current research aims to understand circadian disruptions associated with a wide range of health concerns, including aging, mental health, metabolic disorders, and sleep deprivation.[12] In this domain, Meijer contributed to studies demonstrating that dopamine degradation by monoamine oxidase A is regulated by the circadian clock proteins BMAL1, NPAS2, and PER2 in mice.[13] This finding points to a molecular connection between circadian rhythms, dopamine metabolism, and mood-related behaviors, which may suggest that circadian disruptions play a role in mood regulation.[13]/nStudies conducted by the Meijer lab helped link differences in SCN activity to age-related changes in sleep and circadian function. Through longitudinal electrical recordings in mice, Meijer's group showed that circadian rhythms in the SCN become weaker and desynchronized with increasing age, which has been associated with amyloid aggregation in Alzheimer's disease.[14] These findings suggest that the deterioration of SCN activity may contribute to the circadian dysfunctions observed in Alzheimer's disease.[15]/nResearch on circadian energy metabolism in the Meijer lab helped establish the detrimental effects of a high-fat diet on metabolic gene expression in liver and adipose tissue, supporting the role of circadian alterations in the development of insulin resistance and obesity.[16] Additionally, mouse SCN lesion experiments performed in the Meijer lab identified disruptions in circadian glucose homeostasis rhythms, corroborating observations in whole-animal knockout studies of circadian genes.[16]/nMeijer has also been influential in understanding how medications interact with and affect the daily circadian rhythm of patients. She has studied how methylphenidate delays the circadian clock[17] and investigated how some medications move throughout the body following a 24-hour variation.[18][19] In addition, she has explored the relationship between the time of day medications are administered, such as morphine and levofloxacin, and how the body reacts differently depending on those administration times.[18][20] With this understanding, she researched how certain receptors in the brain also follow a 24-hour rhythm, and specifically how medications could be more effective by taking into account the efflux of the blood\u2013brain barrier through the cerebrospinal fluid.[21]/nMeijer made significant contributions to understanding the non-photic effects on the SCN pacemaker. She found that mammalian's sleep-wake timing is regulated by the SCN pacemaker.[10] Meijer also studied the long-term effects of sleep deprivation in mammals.[22] Studying the circadian response to sleep deprivation, Meijer's group obtained the first evidence that sleep centers in the brain directly regulates activity of the SCN.[23] By live-monitoring the SCN activity and sleep phase in rats, Meijer and colleagues demonstrated that slow-wave activity during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep was associated with reduced SCN activity, whereas rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was correlated with increased SCN activity.[4][23] Furthermore, the transition between NREM and REM sleep was shown to correspond to sharp alterations in SCN firing patterns.[4] In subsequent sleep deprivation experiments, the disruption of slow-wave NREM sleep resulted in increased activity in the SCN, while REM sleep disruption decreased SCN activity.[23] These results indicated that the SCN receives and responds to information on sleep states, although the physiological mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain to be elucidated./nAdditional to Meijer's interests in sleep, she also conducted a study on the effects of chronic caffeine consumption in mice. Her studies showed that unlike traditional conventions of how caffeine may affect sleep, chronic caffeine intake seemed to increase the amplitude of the daily sleep-wake cycle and elevate sleep pressure in mice.[24]/nMeijer has also been an advocate for understanding how circadian rhythms can affect various fields of study. For preterm children being held in the neonatal intensive care unit, she hopes to expand the connection between consistent light-dark cycles and how they could potentially improve the outcome of their health.[25]\u00a0 She also studied how the effect of light dark cycles can affect the temporal behavior, population dynamics and social hierarchy in mice.[26][27]/nIn zebrafish, she expanded on how having either a proactive or reactive personality types can be connected to individual clock gene expression rhythms.[28] She found that individuals with the proactive personality type, characterized as being more aggressive and a higher baseline metabolic rate, had a significant distinct diurnal rhythmicity in clock gene expression. In contrast, individuals with the reactive trait showed a significant lack of diurnal or nocturnal rhythmicity in those same genes./nAdditionally, she has researched whether or not the action of wheel-running, commonly used in many areas of research, is stereotyped or a natural behavior. Stereotyped behaviors are characterized as repetitive, invariant, and lack a goal or function. By comparing the activity of mice in a lab, sand dunes, and an urban environment, she found that wheel running was intentional and occurred in similar rates regardless of captivity. This was confirmed even when a rewarding stimulus was removed from the experiment, as there was an increase in the fraction of mice visits versus wheel activity in non-captivity. This indicated that wheel-running is a rewarding action that mice undertake regardless of the environment they are located in.[29]/nMeijer currently leads the large nation-wide research consortium BioClock, to investigate the biological clock in day-to-day life. This BioClock consortium is a joint collaboration between 13 Dutch Universities and Universities of Applied Sciences together with governmental, semi-governmental and commercial parties. In 2020, BioClock was awarded 9.7 million Euros from the Dutch Research Council (NWO) for the Dutch National Research Agenda [30] program (NWA). Across 25 projects, Meijer and colleagues investigate a unique coverage of the effects of modern daily life on health. Since 80% of the world lives in a light-polluted sky and one in five works in Europe is currently engaged in some form of shift work, important cues for the biological clock have drastically and abruptly changed in the past years. These changes lead to circadian disruption of humans and animals, with large consequences for mental and physical human health, as well as fitness and the chance of survival for many species. Meijer investigates with the BioClock consortium how these challenges can be overcome by uniting experts from different disciplines with the ultimate goal to protect or even strengthen the clock to promote health, quality of life and biodiversity.", "22686435": "Danny Ray Welch is an American cancer biologist and founding director of the University of Kansas Medical Center's Department of Cancer Biology.[1] Welch is also a professor at the University of Kansas School of Medicine and director of the National Foundation for Cancer Research (NFCR) Center for Metastasis Research at KU.

She was best known for her research in limb regeneration, the role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in cell differentiation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT). Hay led many research teams in discovering new findings in these related fields, which led her to obtain several high honors and awards for her work. Hay primarily worked with amphibians during her years of limb regeneration work and then moved onto avian epithelia for research on the ECM and EMT. Hay was thrilled by the introduction of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) during her lifetime, which aided her in many of her findings throughout her career. Moreover, Hay was a huge advocate of women in science during her lifetime.[2]/nBetty Hay was born in Melbourne, Florida, on April 2, 1927, to Isaac and Lucille Elizabeth Hay.  She lived with her parents, twin brother, and sister. When World War II began, her father, who was a practicing physician at the time, enlisted in the US Army Medical Corp. The family was sent to Biloxi, Mississippi. They were soon transferred to Fort Hays, Kansas, where the resided for six months before Lt. Col. Hay was deported to the Philippines. After her chaotic childhood filled with many moves and various schools, Hay attended Smith College for four years.[4] In 1948, she graduated as summa cum laude obtaining her BA degree in Biological Sciences.[2]/nThroughout her life, Hay was always intrigued by animals. During her sophomore year at Smith College, she began research on amphibian limb regeneration with Professor S. Meryl Rose, who became Betty's mentor and close friend. Hay also worked with Rose during the summers at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole.[5] Betty's love for drawing pictures of slides and dissected animals are some of the experiences that cemented her aspiration to pursue a career in biology. Rose eventually convinced Hay to pursue an MD instead of a PhD degree, as he believed it would give Hay more opportunities in the future. She then went on to receive an MD degree from Johns Hopkins in 1952 and was one of only four women in the graduating class.[2]/nIn 1953, on short year after graduating from Johns Hopkins, Hay joined the Hopkins Anatomy Department faculty and continued her work on amphibian regeneration and embryological processes. Soon after, Hay moved to New York City to work with electron microscopists at Cornell Medical College and the Rockefeller Institute. Next, she moved to Harvard with Don Fawcett, who was one of her colleagues while at Cornell. While at Harvard she moved on from studying salamanders to focus more on the embryonic chick cornea. Hay then accepted the Louise Foote Pfeiffer Professorship of Embryology in 1969. In 1971, Hay became editor-in-chief of Developmental Biology. She continued to succeed and was elected chairperson of Harvard's department of anatomy and cellular biology in 1975. She served in this department for 18 years. Hay retired from the cell biology department of Harvard Medical School in 2005.[2]/nHay is best known for her research in limb regeneration, the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) during development, and the role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in cell differentiation.[6] When beginning her research career with Rose, their focus was on the induction of limb regeneration in animals that were not able to regenerate their limbs. They worked on tracing the origin of the cells in regenerating blastema. By transmission electron microscopy (TEM) they showed that the blastema that formed on the amputated surface of the amphibian limb contained uniform undifferentiated cells.[2] These cells lost all remnants of their myofibrils or any other sign of previous differentiation. Hay was able to show the stages of myofibril loss by differentiated muscle cells using TEM. She confirmed that the limb tissues gave rise to undifferentiated blastema cells. Through this research, Hay came to the final conclusion that the differentiated somatic cells of the amphibian limb preserved enough developmental strength to fully regenerate a perfect limb. In other words, the regeneration of the limb is achieved when differentiated cells begin to dedifferentiate and become stem cells.[7]/nIn 1957, Don Fischman started as a medical student at Cornell and immediately joined Betty's laboratory due to his undergraduate experience of working with amphibian limb regeneration. They traced the blastema cells with titrated thymidine and discovered that the epidermis did not enter the blastema. The blastema was the formed internal tissues, not the reserve cells or the epidermis, that gave rise to the regenerating limb.[8] Their autoradiography observations on regenerating limbs also proved that mononuclear blood cells are the source of osteoclasts. When looking at the limbs, they could only obtain labeled nuclei from the monocytes. Therefore, Hay specifically labeled the blood and exhibited that the osteoclasts came from the blood cells.[8]/nIn 1965, Hay met Jim Dobson, who was a scientist that was very good at culturing and growing up epithelium. Hay needed his help in order to prove that the epidermis produced collagen, which was an idea that she and Jean-Paul Revel originally postulated.[5] They used avian corneal epithelium rather than salamander epidermis in order to provide more examples of epithelium secreting collagen. They produced a monograph of their findings, which was published in 1969. Steve Meier joined soon after, and in about 1974, their lab was becoming known for promoting the new idea that the ECM interacted with cells. They cultured corneal epithelium in all types of ECM and were able to show that the ECM can induce cell differentiation and that it directly interacts with cells in the embryo and adult.[9] In 1972, Jonathan Bard came to spend a postdoctoral year in the Hay lab, working on two projects. The first was on corneal endothelium morphogenesis and they, with Sam Meller, showed that the key constraint on migration was space.[10] The second was using Nomarski optics to study how corneal fibroblasts migrated through the stroma in vivo and in collagen gels (a technique developed by JB and Tom Elsdale in Scotland). This work showed that contact inhibition of movement occurred in vivo and in 3D gels.[11]/nGary Greenburg then entered Betty' lab as a graduate student, and they started working with 48-hour chick embryos. They were able to see epithelia transform into mesenchyme when they were suspended in collagen gels.[12] Jim Fitchett also entered the lab at about the same time. He worked with Hay using TEM to prove that EMT removed the palatal seam that forms when the opposite shelves fuse. Furthermore, their studies of the signaling pathways involved in EMT during development led to the discovery that Smads can activate these pathways in the embryo, instead of \u03b2-catenin.[4]/nMany colleagues and fellow scientists claim that Betty's greatest scientific contribution was revealing the role of extracellular matrix in regulating cell behavior, which led to the birth of a new field of cell and developmental biology. Hay believed that knowledge of the ECM was essential in order to understand other subjects including the cytoskeleton, cell migration, cell shape, and the control of cell growth and differentiation. She asserted that the basis of many scientific ideas originate from the full understanding the ECM's composition, relationship to the cell surface, and role in development.[2] In all, Betty's passion for science, dedication to her work, and love for teaching others have all contributed to the legacy she has left./nBetty's work on revealing the role of ECM in regulating cell behavior led to her receiving over twenty national and internal awards. Some of these included the Centennial Award and the Henry Gray Award from the American Association of Anatomists, the FASEB Excellence in Science Award, and the E.B. Wilson Medal from the American Society for Cell Biology.[13] During this time, Hay served as the President of the American Society for Cell Biology,[14] the Society for Development Biology, and the American Association of Anatomists. She was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1984.[2]/nWith Hay's gift honoring her parents, the Isaac Morris and Lucille Elizabeth Hay Professorship in Embryology was established at the Johns Hopkins University in 2009.[15][16] Peter N. Devreotes is the current holder of this academic rank.[15] Elizabeth D. Hay Professorship was established at Harvard Medical School in 2014. Junying Yuan is the current occupant of this chair.[17]/nBetty's immense dedicated and passion in her research caused her to always put her research career before her personal life. This led her to move around a lot by herself and leave many good friends behind. She was always more focused on her work than her relationships. Hay dated many men throughout her life, but she claimed that the men of her time were \"merely looking for home-makers\".[4] Hay never married or had any children. Towards the end of her life she resided in Weston, Massachusetts with many cats. Hay died of lung cancer on August 20, 2007, in hospice in Wayland, Massachusetts.[5]", "62630669": "Carol Kumamoto is an American microbiologist who is Professor of Molecular Biology & Microbiology at Tufts University.

She showed that these mutants were defective in the gene SecB and went on to study the mechanism of action of this protein; showing that it had chaperone activity and was selective in its binding to exported protein precursors.[citation needed]/nKumamoto is a Professor of Molecular Biology & Microbiology at Tufts University.[1] Her research considers Candida albicans (C. albicans), a fungal pathogen that can causes several diseases.[4] C. albicans typically colonises the gastrointestinal tract of humans without causing any problems, but when the host organism becomes immunocompromised the pathogen produces invasive lesions that are associated with candidiasis.[5] Candidiasis is complicated to diagnose and can be fatal.[6] Kumamoto demonstrated that low levels of the protein Efg1p permit fast growth of C. albicans, whereas high levels suppress the growth.[7][8][9]/nIn particular, Kumamoto studies the environmental conditions that cause C. albicans to grow in filamentous, elongated cells, which are able to invade and destroy biological tissue and enter the bloodstream.[10] Early in her career, Kumamoto demonstrated that this filamentous growth occurs when the organism is grown in contact with an agar medium. She showed that the CZF1 gene is a regulator of the filamentation response, and that Mkc1 and Cek1 (MAP kinases) are activated when cells are grown in contact with the agar. She has demonstrated that certain dietary fats, including coconut oil, can suppress the growth of C. albicans in the gut, decreasing the risk of fungal infections.[11] It has been proposed that this finding will decrease the need for antifungal drugs and could be used to decrease the amount of C. albicans in the guts of premature infants.[11] In 2019, Kumamoto reported the first results of a clinical trial that involved supplementing the diets of preterm infants with medium-chain triglycerides to reduce the amount of C. albicans in the gastrointestinal tract.[6]/nKumamoto has also studied candida auris a fungus that was identified in 2009 that appears to withstand anti-fungal drugs.[12]  She is interested in the mechanism by which C. albicans interacts with its host during colonisation and invasive degrees.[1] For example, Kumamoto has demonstrated that the interaction of C. albicans with other pathogens can influence its virulence.[4]/nKumamoto has written for The Conversation.[15]", "60173074": "Elizabeth Winifred Jones (March 8, 1939 \u2013 June 11, 2008) was an American geneticist and professor at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).[1]/nJones earned her bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1960 and her Ph.D. in genetics in 1964, both from the University of Washington.

As a National Science Foundation pre-doctoral Fellow working with Malcolm Whitman, LaBonne characterized the role of FGF signaling in formation of the mesendoderm.  During her doctoral study, LaBonne discovered that activin-mediated mesoderm induction required FGF signaling[3] and elucidated the role of RAS-Map Kinase signaling in this process.[4][5]/nFollowing her graduate work, LaBonne pursued post-doctoral work at the California Institute of Technology as an American Cancer Society Fellow working with Marianne Bronner on the molecular mechanisms underlying the early development of neural crest cells. She showed that formation of neural crest cells, a stem cell population unique to vertebrates, required both attenuation of endogenous BMP signaling and active Wnt signaling, and further showed that up regulation of the zinc-finger transcriptional repressor SNAI2 could bypass the need for BMP inhibition.[6] In subsequent work she demonstrated that Snail-family proteins are required for both establishing the neural crest stem cell state and for the migratory and invasive behavior of neural crest cells,[6] a role these factors also play in metastasizing tumor cells.[7]/nLaBonne started her independent laboratory at Northwestern University in 2001 in the department of Molecular Biosciences (formerly Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Cell Biology).[8] She became a tenured associate professor in 2007, and a full professor in 2012.

She was appointed Chair of the Department of Molecular Biosciences in 2017.[10] LaBonne has served as the co-director of the Embryology course at the Marine Biological Laboratory since 2020.[11]/nResearch in the LaBonne laboratory was the first to link Myc to the acquisition of stem cell attributes, and demonstrated that Myc plays a central role in neural crest ontogeny,[12] several years prior to the initial report of the Yamanaka factors. This work proposed that Myc plays this key role in many stem cell populations, and more recent work by others has shown this to be the case. LaBonne's group subsequently demonstrated that Id3 was a key Myc target in maintaining neural crest potency. The growing realization of the commonalities between pluripotent blastula inner cell mass cells/embryonic stem cells and neural crest cells led LaBonne's group to proposed a new model in which neural crest cells arose via retention of the regulatory network controlling pluripotency in blastula cells and showed that neural crest cells possess a previously unrecognized capacity to form endoderm. This pioneering work created a new framework for studying these developmentally and clinically important cells.[13][14][15] The LaBonne lab also demonstrated a role for FGF signaling in the retention of pluripotency underling neural crest genesis, and discovered that a novel switching of effector pathways, from Map Kinase to PI3 Kinase, controls the transit from pluripotency to lineage restriction.[16] Recent work in the LaBonne lab has focused on the epigenetic control of pluripotency in na\u00efve blastula cells, including a central role for HDAC activity in both maintaining blastula pluripotency and establishment of the neural crest stem cell population.[17]", "53979928": "Robert P.

Using this technique her lab carried out a large genetic screen that identified and cloned 25% of the genes that are essential for a fertilized egg to develop into a free-swimming zebrafish larva. Among the genes identified was an unexpected class of genes which when mutated predispose fish to get cancer, and a set of genes that cause fish to develop cystic kidney and which overlap with genes that cause cystic kidney disease in humans./nIn an effort to help maximize the utility of the zebrafish as a model organism, Hopkins and colleagues set out to develop a large-scale insertional mutagenesis method.  Although large-scale chemical mutagenesis screens were getting underway in several zebrafish labs at the time (those of Mark Fishman in Boston, and Christiane Nusslein-Volhard in T\u00fcbingen, Germany), there were concerns in the community at the time that identifying the molecular lesions using positional cloning methods would be inefficient.  Hopkins believed that insertional mutagenesis, which had been very successfully employed in invertebrate model organisms (D. melanogaster and C. elegans), would provide a valuable alternative or adjunct to the chemical screens./nDuring the mid-90s, Hopkins felt she and other women were systematically discriminated against at MIT. In July 1994, together with 15 other women faculty in the School of Science at MIT, Hopkins drafted and co-signed a letter to the then-Dean of Science (now Chancellor of Berkeley) Robert Birgeneau, stating their evidence regarding gender discrimination.[3] Due to her complaints to the administration, a committee was formed (with Hopkins as the initial chair) to investigate the issue of inequalities experienced by women faculty as a result of unconscious gender bias.[4] The committee existed in two forms over the course of a four-year period and included both men and women faculty members, including men who were current or previous chairs of the departments of mathematics, chemistry, and physics.[5]/nThe results were bold but contentious: A summary of the committee's findings, published in 1999[6] and endorsed by then-MIT president Charles Vest and then-Dean Robert Birgeneau, is credited with launching a national re-examination of equity for women scientists. While some have questioned the rigor of the analysis performed by the MIT committee,[7][8] MIT's efforts are considered by many to be a laudable example of self-monitoring by a world-renowned institution of higher education.[9][8][10][11]/nIt also led 9 research universities, including MIT, to form an ongoing collaboration to study and address issues of gender equity. The group, which came to be known as \u201cThe MIT-9\u201d, includes Harvard University, Stanford University, California Institute of Technology, Princeton University, University of Pennsylvania, University of Michigan, Yale University, and University of California, Berkeley, in addition to MIT.  Hopkins involved many experts, who were researching the status of women and minorities among faculty, in these collaborations.  At the MIT-9 meetings, Donna Nelson presented the Nelson Diversity Surveys to compare the representation of women among faculty at these individual universities versus the national data./nIn 2020, Hopkins appeared in the Tribeca Film Festival in the film \"Picture a Scientist\", presenting the MIT study.[12][13][14]/nHopkins stated that when she was an undergraduate in the 1960s, Francis Crick put his hands on her breasts during a lab visit.[15] She described the incident: \"Before I could rise and shake hands, he had zoomed across the room, stood behind me, put his hands on my breasts and said, 'What are you working on?'\"[16]/nIn January 2005, at an NBER meeting in Cambridge, MA on the topic of how to address the under-representation of women and minorities in science and engineering fields, Hopkins caused controversy by walking out in protest during a talk by then President of Harvard Lawrence Summers when he speculated that one reason for the very small number of high-achieving women in science and engineering fields might be \u201cintrinsic aptitude\u201d (specifically that the bell-curve of aptitude is flatter for men than women).[17] Her action became public when she replied to an e-mail from Boston Globe reporter Marcella Bombardieri inquiring about Summers\u2019 speech.[18] Bombardieri's report of Summers\u2019 speech set off a national discussion of gender discrimination, and academic freedom, and contributed to Summers\u2019 resignation as the President of Harvard.[18]/nHopkins has been married to J.

His work in this area has shed light on the distinguishing features of the human respiratory system and has had particular implications for understanding the origins of human speech and language.[4]  Laitman's studies have frequently been the source of much discussion on how living humans may differ from other groups, such as Neanderthals.[5]  His work has frequently been covered in the lay and scientific press, and he has often appeared in television documentaries on human origins and the evolution of speech and language both in the United States and abroad, such as the award-winning Miracle Planet Series,[6]  the BBC Documentary, The Day We Learned to Think,[7] and The History Channel documentary, Clash of the Cavemen./nHe has introduced the use of laparoscopes and robots into first-year anatomy education, and collaborated with medical students to teach musculoskeletal anatomy through yoga and Pilates,[8] the latter innovation having received national awards and recognitions.[9][10]  Laitman and colleagues have also pioneered new approaches to introducing \"team-work,\" \"team-responsibility\" and \"team-teaching,\" that bring these essential components of physician development early into the medical school curriculum.[11]  He has been particularly successful in mentoring faculty, many of whom have won educational awards both from Mount Sinai and international societies.  Laitman has created Teaching Assistant programs for advanced medical and graduate students that allow them to learn how to teach while gaining an even greater knowledge of anatomy.  He has been the recipient of many recognitions for teaching and mentorship both within Mount Sinai[12] and from societies around the world.[13]/nLaitman took his bachelor's degree at Brooklyn College of the City University of New York, from which he graduated summa cum laude with honors in Physical Anthropology and History in 1973.  Upon graduation from Brooklyn College, he undertook graduate study in Physical Anthropology and Anatomy at Yale University, where he received his M.Phil. in 1975 and Ph.D. in 1977.[14]  At Yale Laitman studied under noted anatomist Edmund S. Crelin of the Yale School of Medicine, paleoanthropologist David R. Pilbeam, paleontologist Elwyn Simons, and primate biologists Alison Richard and Robert D. Martin.  He also studied under the famous French paleanthropologist Yves Coppens at the Mus\u00e9e de l'Homme and Coll\u00e8ge de France, both as a student and during many subsequent research visits to Paris.  In 1976, while still a graduate student, he was appointed Lecturer in Anatomy at the Yale University School of Medicine and, in 1977, chosen a Research Fellow of the Human Growth and Development Study Unit at Yale University School of Medicine./nIn 1977, Laitman joined the faculty of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine as Instructor in Anatomy.

Campbell Professor of Biology and University Research Professor Emeritus at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia.[1][2][3]  Hall has researched and extensively written on bone and cartilage formation in developing vertebrate embryos. He is an active participant in the evolutionary developmental biology (EVO-DEVO) debate on the nature and mechanisms of animal body plan formation.  Hall has proposed that the neural crest tissue of vertebrates may be viewed as a fourth embryonic germ layer.  As such, the neural crest - in Hall's view - plays a role equivalent to that of the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm of bilaterian development and is a definitive feature of vertebrates (as hypothesized by Gans and Northcutt[1983]).  As such, vertebrates are the only quadroblastic, rather than triploblastic bilaterian animals.  In vertebrates the neural crest serves to integrate the somatic division (derived from ectoderm and mesoderm) and visceral division (derived from endoderm and mesoderm) together via a wide range novel vertebrate tissues (bone, cartilage, sympathetic nervous system, etc...)./nHe has been associated with Dalhousie University since 1968.

Murray, FAA (Fellow of the Australian Academy), concerned the differentiation of bone and secondary cartilage in chicken embryos.[4]/nOver the course of his career, Hall's laboratory research has focused on developmental biology and evolutionary biology. His work played a major role in integrating these two fields into the discipline now known as Evolutionary Developmental Biology (evo-devo). He and his students, according to one source, \"pioneered an epigenetic view of bone differentiation and of vertebrate development in general, and highlighted the importance of epigenetic tissue interactions in vertebrate evolution.\" His 1975 paper \"Evolutionary consequences of skeletal differentiation\" (American Zoologist) marked the beginning of \"the process of building a bridge between evolutionary and developmental biology from the developmental biology side.\" His 1992 textbook Evolutionary Developmental Biology is widely viewed as definitive. \"This work defines a field, which, in turn, has revitalized the study of evolution,\" writes one source./nHall is particularly interested in the vertebrate neural crest and in skeletal tissues that arise from neural crest cells./nHe has also written extensively about the history of evolutionary biology and about leading figures in the field.  \"Hall's understanding of the intellectual roots of his discipline,\" one source observes, \"deepens his perspective on current theoretical issues and colors much of his writing.\"[4]/nHall has spent his career in the Biology Department of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he was hired as an assistant professor in 1968.

It addresses the role of the germ layers in early embryogenesis, the development of nervous systems, and the evolution of the vertebrate head. It also examines mutations, tumors, and the exposure of embryos to exogenous agents.[8]/nThe Origin and Evolution of Larval Forms by Hall and Marvalee H.

Ren\u00e9 Louiche Desfontaines launched de Candolle's botanical career by recommending him at a herbarium. Within a couple of years de Candolle had established a new genus, and he went on to document hundreds of plant families and create a new natural plant classification system. Although de Candolle's main focus was botany, he also contributed to related fields such as phytogeography, agronomy, paleontology, medical botany, and economic botany./nDe Candolle originated the idea of \"Nature's war\", which influenced Charles Darwin and the principle of natural selection.[1] de Candolle recognized that multiple species may develop similar characteristics that did not appear in a common evolutionary ancestor; a phenomenon now known as convergent evolution. During his work with plants, de Candolle noticed that plant leaf movements follow a near-24-hour cycle in constant light, suggesting that an internal biological clock exists. Though many scientists doubted de Candolle's findings, experiments over a century later demonstrated that \"the internal biological clock\" indeed exists./nDe Candolle's descendants continued his work on plant classification; son Alphonse and grandson Casimir de Candolle contributed to the Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis, a catalog of plants begun by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle./nAugustin Pyramus de Candolle was born on 4 February 1778 in Geneva, Republic of Geneva, to Augustin de Candolle, a former official, and his wife, Louise El\u00e9onore Bri\u00e8re. His family descended from one of the ancient families of Provence in France, but relocated to Geneva at the end of the 16th century to escape religious persecution.[2]/nAt age seven de Candolle contracted a severe case of hydrocephalus, which significantly affected his childhood.[3] Nevertheless, he is said to have had great aptitude for learning, distinguishing himself in school with his rapid acquisition of knowledge in classical and general literature and his ability to write fine poetry. In 1794, he began his scientific studies at the Coll\u00e8ge de Gen\u00e8ve, where he studied under Jean Pierre \u00c9tienne Vaucher, who later inspired de Candolle to make botanical science the chief pursuit of his life.[2]/nHe spent four years at the Geneva Academy, studying science and law according to his father's wishes. In 1798, he moved to Paris after Geneva had been annexed to the French Republic. His botanical career formally began with the help of Ren\u00e9 Louiche Desfontaines, who recommended de Candolle for work in the herbarium of Charles Louis L'H\u00e9ritier de Brutelle during the summer of 1798.[4] The position elevated de Candolle's reputation and also led to valuable instruction from Desfontaines himself.[4] de Candolle established his first genus, Senebiera, in 1799.[4]/nDe Candolle's first books, Plantarum historia succulentarum (4 vols., 1799) and Astragalogia (1802), brought him to the notice of Georges Cuvier and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. de Candolle, with Cuvier's approval, acted as deputy at the Coll\u00e8ge de France in 1802. Lamarck entrusted him with the publication of the third edition of the Flore fran\u00e7aise (1805\u20131815),[a][2][6] and in the introduction entitled Principes \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires de botanique, de Candolle proposed a natural method of plant classification as opposed to the artificial Linnaean method.[7][2] The premise of de Candolle's method is that taxa do not fall along a linear scale; they are discrete, not continuous.[8] Lamarck had originally published this work in 1778, with a second edition in 1795. The third edition, which bears the name of both Lamarck and de Candolle, was in reality the work of the latter, the former having only lent his name and access to his collection.[9]/nIn 1804, de Candolle published his Essai sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s m\u00e9dicales des plantes and was granted a doctor of medicine degree by the medical faculty of Paris. Two years later, he published Synopsis plantarum in flora Gallica descriptarum. de Candolle then spent the next six summers making a botanical and agricultural survey of France at the request of the French government, which was published in 1813. In 1807 he was appointed professor of botany in the medical faculty of the University of Montpellier, where he would later become the first chair of botany in 1810. His teaching at the University of Montpellier consisted of field classes attended by 200\u2013300 students, starting at 5:00 am and finishing at 7:00 pm.[10]/nDuring this period, de Candolle became a close acquaintance of the Portuguese polymath, Jos\u00e9 Correia da Serra, who was Portuguese ambassador to Paris and who circulated in an international network of thinkers ranging from the Briton Joseph Banks to the Americans Thomas Jefferson and William Bartram, and the French scholars Antoine Laurent de Jussieu and Georges Cuvier.  Correia's endorsement of the idea of emphasizing similarity and symmetry in classifying plants influenced de Candolle, who acknowledged as much in his writing.[11][12]/nWhile in Montpellier, de Candolle published his Th\u00e9orie \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de la botanique (Elementary Theory of Botany, 1813),[2] which introduced a new classification system and the word taxonomy.[13] Candolle moved back to Geneva in 1816 and in the following year was invited by the government of the Canton of Geneva to fill the newly created chair of natural history.[2]/nDe Candolle spent the rest of his life in an attempt to elaborate and complete his natural system of botanical classification. de Candolle published initial work in his Regni vegetabillis systema naturale, but after two volumes he realized he could not complete the project on such a large scale. Consequently, he began his less extensive Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis in 1824. However, he was able to finish only seven volumes, or two-thirds of the whole.[2] Even so, he was able to characterize over one hundred families of plants, helping to lay the empirical basis of general botany.[14] Although de Candolle's main focus was botany, throughout his career he also dabbled in fields related to botany, such as phytogeography, agronomy, paleontology, medical botany, and economic botany.[15]/nIn 1827 he was elected an associated member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands.[16]/nAugustin de Candolle was the first of four generations of botanists in the de Candolle dynasty.[17] He married Mademoiselle Torras and their son, Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle,  eventually succeeded to his father's chair in botany and continued the Prodromus.[2] Casimir de Candolle, Augustin de Candolle's grandson, also contributed to the Prodromus through his detailed, extensive research and characterization of the plant family Piperaceae.[18] Augustin de Candolle's great-grandson, Richard \u00c9mile Augustin de Candolle, was also a botanist.[19] Augustin de Candolle died on 9 September 1841 in Geneva, after being sick for many years.[2] That same year, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.[20]/nIn 2017, a book[21] was written in French about his life and one of his greatest contributions, the Botanical Garden of Geneva./nHe is remembered in the plant genera Candollea and Candolleodendron,[22] several plant species like Eugenia candolleana or Diospyros candolleana and the mushroom Psathyrella candolleana.[23] Candollea, a scientific journal that publishes papers on systematic botany and phylotaxonomy,[24] was named after de Candolle and his descendants in honor of their contribution to the field of botany.[18] He was a mentor to the French-Mexican botanist Jean-Louis Berlandier and is credited with encouraging Marie-Anne Libert to investigate cryptogamic flora.[25]/nde Candolle also had the unexpected distinction of triggering the adoption of pre-paid postage in the Canton and City of Geneva, in a long address which he gave to the governing council in 1843. This led to them issuing Switzerland's second postage stamp, the famous Double Geneva later in that year [26] (see also postage stamps and postal history of Switzerland)./nDe Candolle was the first to put forward the idea of \"Nature's war\",[1] writing of plants being \"at war one with another\" with the meaning of different species fighting each other for space and resources.[27] Charles Darwin studied de Candolle's \"natural system\" of classification in 1826 when at the University of Edinburgh,[28] and in the inception of Darwin's theory in 1838 he considered \"the warring of the species\", adding that it was even more strongly conveyed by Thomas Malthus,[29] producing the pressures that Darwin later called natural selection.[27] In 1839 de Candolle visited Britain and Darwin invited him to dinner, allowing the two scientists the opportunity to discuss the idea.[1]/nDe Candolle was also among the first to recognize the difference between the morphological and physiological characteristics of organs. He ascribed plant morphology as being related to the number of organs and their positions relative to each other rather than to their various physiological properties. Consequently, this made him the first to attempt to attribute specific reasons for structural and numerical relationships amongst organs, and thus to distinguish between major and minor aspects of plant symmetry.[14] To account for modifications of symmetry in parts of different plants, an occurrence that could hinder the discovery of an evolutionary relationship, de Candolle introduced the concept of homology.[30]/nDe Candolle also made contributions to the field of chronobiology. Building upon earlier work on plant circadian leaf movements contributed by such scientists as Jean-Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan and Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau, de Candolle observed in 1832 that the plant Mimosa pudica had a free-running period of leaf opening and closing of approximately 22\u201323 hours in constant light, significantly less than the approximate 24-hour period of the Earth's light-dark cycles.[31][32] Since the period was shorter than 24 hours, he hypothesized that a different clock had to be responsible for the rhythm; the shortened period was not entrained\u2014coordinated\u2014by environmental cues, thus the clock appeared to be endogenous.[33] Despite these findings, a number of scientists continued to search for \"factor X\", an unknown exogenous factor associated with the earth's rotation that was driving circadian oscillations in the absence of a light dark schedule, until the mid-twentieth century.[34] In the mid-1920s, Erwin Bunning repeated Candolle's findings and came to similar conclusions, and studies that showed the persistence of circadian rhythm in the South Pole and in a space lab further confirmed the existence of oscillations in the absence of environmental cues.[34]", "37858224": "Carl Benda (30 December 1857 Berlin \u2013 24 May 1932 Turin) was one of the first microbiologists to use a microscope in studying the internal structure of cells. In an 1898 experiment using crystal violet as a specific stain, Benda first became aware of the existence of hundreds of these tiny bodies in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells and assumed that they reinforced the cell structure. Because of their tendency to form long chains, he coined the name mitochondria (\"thread granules\").[1] These bodies had first been noted in 1857 by the physiologist and pioneer of the light microscope, Albert von K\u00f6lliker, and were later termed \"bioblasts\" by Richard Altmann in 1886.[2]/nBenda studied medicine in Berlin, Heidelberg, Vienna and Paris, and received his doctorate in medicine in 1881.

The measurements were repeated in the same group of 14 volunteers with a four-week washout between intakes.[5]/nThe bioavailability study results showed statistically significant differences in the bioavailability of the various formulations. The ubiquinone formulation with the best bioavailability had a Cmax and an area under the curve nearly double that of the ubiquinol formulation. The ubiquinol formulation outperformed other less well-formulated ubiquinone formulations. These study results indicated that the formulation of the Coenzyme Q10 supplement is more important for absorption and bioavailability than the form (ubiquinone vs ubiquinol) of the supplement is.[5]/nThe bioavailability study also showed considerable variation in the participants' capacity to achieve an increase of Coenzyme Q10 in blood from a supplement.[5]/nCoenzyme Q10 and Aging/nIn 2020, Professor Navas wrote the lead chapter in the book Coenzyme Q in Aging, edited by Professor L\u00f3pez-Lluch. Professor Navas emphasized the main functions of Coenzyme Q10 as an electron carrier in respiratory chain and as an antioxidant in the regulation of mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity in the aging process. He pointed out that the complete Coenzyme Q10 bio-synthesis pathway and the adaptation of Coenzyme Q10 to different pathological conditions to guarantee cell survival need further research.[4]/nIn 2018, Professors Navas and L\u00f3pez-Lluch and colleagues published a review of the published results from clinical trials based on Coenzyme Q10 supplementation and aging. They found evidence that the supplementation positively affects mitochondrial deficiency syndrome and the symptoms of aging. The effect is achieved primarily through improvements in cellular bio-energetics. The antioxidant effect of Coenzyme Q10 alleviates systemic inflammation and improves the symptoms and survival of heart failure patients. Numerous published reports suggest that combining Coenzyme Q10 supplementation with statin medication could prevent the side effects resulting from statin treatment.[6]/nIn their review article, Professors Navas and L\u00f3pez-Lluch summarized the outcomes of the Q-Symbio Study and the KiSel-10 Study.[6]/nThe Q-Symbio Study was a randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of Coenzyme Q10 adjuvant treatment on morbidity and mortality in chronic heart failure: a 2-year treatment with Coenzyme Q10 in the ubiquinone form (3 times 100\u00a0mg/day) demonstrated significant improvement in the survival and symptoms as well as a significant reduction in major cardiovascular events in chronic heart failure patients.[7]/nThe KiSel-10 Study was a randomized controlled trial of the effects of long-term treatment with Coenzyme Q10 as ubiquinone (2 times 100\u00a0mg/day) plus selenium (200 microg as selenized yeast) in a healthy elderly population (average age: 78 years). The study results revealed a significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality not only during the 4-year treatment period but also 12 years later, compared to those taking a placebo.[8][9]/nCoenzyme Q10 and Physical Activity/nIn 2014, Professor Navas and colleagues published two papers on Coenzyme Q10 and physical activity. In the one paper, they reported that they had measured the levels of Coenzyme Q10 and cholesterol in the plasma of young and old individuals with differing degrees of physical activity. Their results indicated that plasma Coenzyme Q10 levels in old people are higher than the levels found in young people. However, they found differing relationships between Coenzyme Q10 levels and physical activity depending on the age of individuals.[10]/nIn young people, higher physical activity correlated with lower Coenzyme Q10 levels in plasma; in older adults, higher activity was associated with higher plasma Q10 levels and higher Coenzyme Q10/Cholesterol ratios.[10]/nThe higher Coenzyme Q10 levels in plasma were associated with lower levels of lipid-peroxidation and oxidized LDL in the elderly people. The study results indicated that physical activity in the senior years can improve antioxidant capacity in plasma and thus possibly reduce the risk of heart disease.[10]/nIn a second 2014 paper, Professor Navas and colleagues studied a cohort of healthy community-living senior citizens. They tested the volunteers on handgrip strength, six-minute walk, Number of chair stands, and time up and go. They found that individuals with higher levels of functional capacity also had lower levels of cholesterol and lipid peroxidation as well as higher levels of Coenzyme Q10 in plasma.[11]/nThe study results showed that higher levels of functional capacity were associated with higher levels of Coenzyme Q10 and with lower levels of a bio-marker for oxidative stress (malondialdehyde) in the blood of community-living elderly people. The study results suggested that both aerobic and strength exercise are necessary for senior citizens.[11]/nIn a 2018 study, Professor Navas and his fellow researchers investigated the relationship of plasma Coenzyme Q10 levels of elite athletes \u2013 professional soccer players in the Spanish Liga 1 \u2013 to the levels of known bio-markers for muscle damage (creatine kinase), kidney damage (uric acid), and stress damage (cortisol).  Their findings suggested that high levels of plasma Coenzyme Q10 can prevent muscle damage, improve kidney function, and contribute to higher performance in professional soccer players.[12]/nCoenzyme Q10 Deficiency/nCoenzyme Q10 deficiency disorders are classified as primary Coenzyme Q10 deficiency \u2013 caused by mutations in the genes that code for Coenzyme Q10 bio-synthesis \u2013 and secondary Coenzyme Q10 deficiency \u2013 caused by mutations in genes not related to Coenzyme Q10 bio-synthesis of by other non-genetic factors. Primary Coenzyme Q10 deficiency disorders are rare. Secondary Coenzyme Q10 deficiencies, both those related to genetic causes and those related to environmental conditions, are the main causes of biochemical Coenzyme Q10 deficiency. It has not been possible to link most of the cases of Coenzyme Q10 deficiency to a specific genetic diagnosis. Moreover, the pathogenesis of Coenzyme Q10 deficiency cannot be attributed solely to defects in the process of cellular bio-energetics. Early recognition of Coenzyme Q10 deficiency is necessary to avoid irreversible tissue damage by instituting timely and appropriate treatment.[13]/nIn addition, many studies have shown reduced levels of Coenzyme Q10 in aging individuals and in individuals with other non-hereditary diseases.[13]/nCoenzyme Q10 and Autism/nIn a 2014 paper, Professors Crane, Navas, and Gvozdj\u00e1kov\u00e1 report on the results of a pilot study investigating the effect of Coenzyme Q10 supplement in the ubiquinol form on 24 autistic children aged 3 to 6 years (17 boys, 7 girls). The researchers administered daily doses of 50\u00a0mg of a liquid ubiquinol diluted in milk, tea, or juice to the children during the first week of the study. In week 2, they increased the daily dose to 2 times 50\u00a0mg in separate doses. They treated the children with 2 times 50\u00a0mg ubiquinol for three months. For ethical reasons, the researchers did not have a placebo control group in the study.[14]/nThe mean total Coenzyme Q10 level in blood increased 489% from the baseline level to the 3-month post-supplementation level. The researchers observed a significant improvement in the symptoms of autism after 3 months of ubiquinol supplementation in the children who maintained a total Coenzyme Q10 plasma concentration at or over 2.5 micromol/L (= 2.16 micrograms/mL).[14]/nThe improvement in the symptoms of autism in percentage of children were in the areas of communication (12% of the children), verbal communication (21%), playing games (42%), sleeping (34%), and food acceptance (17%). Supplementation with ubiquinol, the reduced form of Coenzyme Q10, produced favorable responses in children with autism. Professors Crane, Navas, and Gvozdj\u00e1kov\u00e1 hypothesized that autism is controlled by a Coenzyme Q-dependent redox system in the porin channels; the mechanism still needs to be established.[14]/nReduction of Coenzyme Q10 and Antioxidant Activity/nCoenzyme Q10 molecules are redox molecules. They have the capacity to accept and donate electrons. In the cells, Coenzyme Q10 molecules are found in three different redox states: oxidized (ubiquinone), semi-oxidized (semiubiquinone), and reduced (ubiquinol)./nReduced Coenzyme Q10 prevents lipid peroxidation in liposomes and plasma membranes. Coenzyme Q is reduced by the dehydrogenase enzymes NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase and NAD(P)H:quinone reductase 1. Reduced Coenzyme Q10 prevents lipid peroxidation chain reaction./nIn a 1997 study, Professor Navas and a team of researchers found that cytochrome b5 reductase maintains Coenzyme Q10 and ascorbate in their reduced state to support their antioxidant activity. Thus, Coenzyme Q10 and ascorbate acting as antioxidants at the plasma membrane represent a first-line barrier protecting lipids from oxidative stress and subsequent apoptosis.[15]", "1747943": "Richard Machalek (born April 12, 1946) is a social theorist, sociobiologist, and professor of sociology./nA student and colleague of sociobiologist E.O.

Born in 1952 in Poland, she emigrated to Israel in 1957.  She is a professor at the Cohn Institute for the History of Philosophy of Science and Ideas at Tel Aviv University. In 1981 she was awarded the Landau prize of Israel for outstanding Master of Science (M.Sc.) work and in 1988, the Marcus prize for outstanding Ph.D. work.[1] She is a proponent of academic freedom, recognising that on such matters, \"academic and political issues cannot really be kept apart\", although she is not a proponent of simplistic solutions, and shows a preference to describe her own position.[2]/nJablonka publishes about evolutionary themes, especially epigenetics. Her emphasis on non-genetic forms of evolution has received interest from those attempting to expand the scope of evolutionist thinking into other spheres. Jablonka has been described as being in the vanguard of an ongoing revolution within evolutionary biology, and is a leading proponent of the extended evolutionary synthesis.[3][4][5]/nHer first book on the subject of epigenetics, Epigenetic Inheritance and Evolution: the Lamarckian Dimension (1995), was co-authored with Marion Lamb. Her book Animal Traditions (2000), co-authored with Eytan Avital, extended models of human cultural transmission to the non-human animal world, to show that cultural evolution has played an important role in the evolution of other animals.[6] Jablonka again co-authored with Lamb on Evolution in Four Dimensions (2005). Building on the approach of evolutionary developmental biology, and recent findings of molecular and behavioral biology, they argue the case for the transmission of not just genes per se, but heritable variations transmitted from generation to generation by whatever means. They suggest that such variation can occur at four levels. Firstly, at the established physical level of genetics. Secondly, at the epigenetic level involving variation in the \"meaning\" of given DNA strands, in which variations in DNA translation during developmental processes are subsequently transmitted during reproduction, which can then feed back into sequence modification of DNA itself. The third dimension is one of particular interest to Jablonka, comprising the transmission of behavioural traditions. There are for example documented cases of food preferences being passed on, by social learning, in several animal species, which remain stable from generation to generation while conditions permit. The fourth dimension is symbolic inheritance, which is unique to humans, and in which traditions are passed on \u201cthrough our capacity for language, and culture, our representations of how to behave, communicated by speech and writing.\u201d[7] In their treatment of the higher levels, Jablonka and Lamb distinguish their approach from the banalities of evolutionary psychology, of \"memes\", and even from Chomskian ideas of universal grammar. They argue that there are constant interactions between the levels \u2013 epigenetic, behavioural and even symbolic inheritance mechanisms also produce selection pressures on DNA-based inheritance and can, in some cases, even help direct DNA changes themselves \u2013 so \"evolving evolution\". To liven their text, they utilise thought experiments and dialogue with a sceptical enquirer, one IM-Ifcha Mistabra, Aramaic, they say, for \"the opposite conjecture\".[7]/nIn 2008, Jablonka and Lamb published the paper Soft inheritance: Challenging the Modern Synthesis which claimed there is evidence for Lamarckian epigenetic control systems causing evolutionary changes and the mechanisms underlying epigenetic inheritance can also lead to saltational changes that reorganize the epigenome.[8]/nIn 2019, Jablonka and Simona Ginsburg published The Evolution of the Sensitive Soul: Learning and the Origins of Consciousness. In it, Jablonka and Ginsburg propose a new theory about the origin of consciousness, centered on learning. Inspired by methodologies used to mark the transition from non-life to life, the authors suggest a set of criteria marking the transition to minimal consciousness: a complex form of associative learning, which they term unlimited associative learning./nIn 2022, Jablonka and Ginsburg published Picturing the Mind: Consciousness through the Lens of Evolution. In it, they examined the questions of what consciousness is and how it evolved, and who or what is conscious. They suggest that consciousness is found not only in humans but also in such animals as octopuses and bees, as well as speculating about aliens and artificial intelligence. They also examine what sets humans apart, be it music, toolmaking, sentience, or symbolic language.[9][10]/nJ. Bruce Walsh was skeptical of Jablonka's claims in the book Epigenetic Inheritance and Evolution regarding the importance of epigenetic inheritance in evolution.[11] R. J. Berry, however, wrote that the book made a strong case for the importance of epigenetic inheritance in evolution and recommended the book for evolutionary biologists.[12]/nJan Zima wrote a positive review for the book Evolution in Four Dimensions concluding \"the book can be recommended both to professional scientists and all the students interested in biological ideas and the current ways of thinking about biology\".[13] Stuart Newman also positively reviewed the book.[14]/nThomas Dickens and Qazi Rahman have written epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modification are genetically inherited under the control of natural selection, and do not challenge the modern evolutionary synthesis.

In July 2015 he became a member of Giving What We Can, an organization whose members pledge to give at least 10% of their income to effective charities.[11]/nBohannon completed his Doctor of Philosophy degree in molecular biology at the University of Oxford in 2002, supervised by Paul Rainey.[12][13][14] His doctoral thesis investigated the role of an operon in the adaptive evolution of populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens and was supervised by Paul Rainey. [12]/nBohannon is Director of Science at Primer, a San Francisco, California, company that develops and sells artificial intelligence technology, started by his friend Sean Gourley.[15][1] Before joining Primer, Bohannon was a contributing correspondent for Science Magazine[15] and also wrote for Discover Magazine, Wired, The Guardian, Christian Science Monitor, and other publications.[16]/nBohannon has frequently reported on the intersections of science and war. He received a Reuters environmental journalism award in 2006 for his reporting on the water crisis in Gaza.[17] In that year he also critiqued the Lancet surveys of Iraq War casualties.[6][7] After embedding in southern Afghanistan in 2010, he was the first journalist to convince the US military to voluntarily release civilian casualty data.[18]/nTwo of his later journalism projects are described below./nIn September 2013, Bohannon submitted a fake and very flawed scientific article to a large number of fee-charging open-access publishers,[8][9] revealing that less than 40% were living up to their promise of rigorously peer-reviewing what is published. The spoof paper was accepted by 157 of the 255 open-access journals (61.6%) that said they would review it.[19] This approach was criticized by some commentators, as well as by some publishers of fee charging journals, who complained that his sting only targeted one type of open-access journal and no subscription-based journals, damaging the reputation of the open access movement.[20][21][22][23]/nUnder the pseudonym Johannes Bohannon, John Bohannon wrote a paper\u00a0\u2013 \"Chocolate with high Cocoa content as a weight-loss accelerator\"[24]\u00a0\u2013 detailing a deliberately bad study that he had designed and run to see how the media would pick up the \"meaningless\"[10] findings. He worked with film-maker Peter Onneken, who was making a film about junk science in the diet industry and how fad diets became headline news despite having deeply flawed study designs and very little supporting evidence.[10]/nBohannon's bogus study had a tiny sample size of 15 and measured 18 variables, almost guaranteeing an erroneously statistically significant result (false positive) due to random fluctuations in participant outcomes. He told a statistician to deliberately massage the data using overfitting and p-hacking. The study had other serious design flaws as well, but the erroneous conclusion was that eating chocolate could assist with weight loss.[10]/nBohannon submitted the manuscript to 20 open-access publishers well known for their predatory journals and ended up being published in the International Archives of Medicine.[10] He invented a fake institute, \"The Institute of Diet and Health,\" to go along with his fake name, \"Johannes Bohannon,\" and fabricated a press release[25] which was picked by the German tabloid Bild, as well as \"the Daily Star, the Irish Examiner, Cosmopolitan's German website, The Times of India, both the German and Indian site of the Huffington Post, and television news in the US and an Australian morning talk show.\"[10]/nThe few journalists who contacted Bohannon (acting as Johannes) asked puff piece questions, and no reporter published how many subjects were tested or quoted independent researchers.[10] Most outlets sought to maximize page views by including \"vaguely pornographic images of women eating chocolate.\"[10] Bohannon says:/nThe only problem with the diet science beat is that it's science. You have to know how to read a scientific paper\u00a0\u2013 and actually bother to do it. For far too long, the people who cover this beat have treated it like gossip, echoing whatever they find in press releases. Hopefully our little experiment will make reporters and readers alike more skeptical.[10]/nBohannon's science journalism extended to his on-line \"Gonzo Scientist\" series at Science Magazine, where he adopted the \"Gonzo Scientist\" persona.[4][26] As the Gonzo Scientist, Bohannon took \"a look at the intersections among science, culture, and art\u00a0\u2013 and, in true gonzo style, [didn't] shrink from making himself a part of the story. The stories include original art and accompanying multimedia features.\"[4] In Gonzo Scientist mode, Bohannon's research on whether humans can tell the difference between p\u00e2t\u00e9 and dog food led to Stephen Colbert eating cat food on the Colbert Report.[27]/nMany Gonzo Scientist columns[28][29] were devoted to advertising the Dance Your PhD[30] competition, which Bohannon created in early 2008.[5][31] The annual competition encourages scientists from all around the world to interpret their doctoral dissertations in dance form. Slate Magazine ran a profile on Bohannon and the competition in 2011.[5]/nBohannon performed with the Black Label Movement[32] dance troupe at TEDxBrussels in November 2011, where he satirized Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal by modestly proposing that PowerPoint software be replaced by live dancers.[33] Bohannon then went on to perform with Black Label Movement at TED2012[34] in March in Long Beach, California.[35] And, in April 2012, Bohannon presented on the Dance Your PhD contest at the Northeast Conference on Science and Skepticism (NECSS).[36]/nIn 2015,[37] Bohannon appeared on the \"Adam Ruins Nutrition\" episode of the Adam Ruins Everything truTV series.[38] In 2016, he joined Adam Ruins Everything host Adam Conover on episode 5 of Adam's Adam Ruins Everything podcast series, \"Science Journalism with John Bohannon,\" where he spoke about the fake chocolate study described above and discussed how fraudulent studies are created and promoted through mass media.[38]", "18197503": "Richard A. Houghten is a heterocyclic organic chemist and founder of the journal Peptide Research, which was later merged with the International Journal of Peptide and Protein Research, to become the Journal of Peptide Research.  His work mainly concerns peptide activity and pharmacology.[1] He is the founder and president of the Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies (TPIMS), a biomedical research institute.  Houghten pioneered the \"tea-bag\" approach of producing peptides for pharmacological work.[2]/nHe is author of over five hundred scientific papers, 38 of which have been cited at least one hundred times. His h-index is over 60./nHoughten received his PhD in organic chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley in 1975. He had  previously received a BS in chemistry from California State University, Fresno and an M.S. in chemistry from Berkeley. He held a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco, then an assistant professorship at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, City University of New York, and then joined the Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, working with Richard Lerner. Houghten branched out to the business world in the 1980s, forming Multiple Peptide Systems in 1986, the Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies (TPIMS) in 1988 and Houghten Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 1990.[3][4]/nCombinatorial biology is the generation of large numbers of molecules (usually peptides, enzymes or other polypeptides in biology) with non-natural metabolic pathways.  The resulting set of molecules is referred to as a library.[5] Because traditional methods of chemical discovery and selection relied on \"natural\" pathways (those formed by sources found in the wild and brought into the library), creation of the requisite number of peptides for new drug discovery was impractical.  New drugs needed to be built from specific combinations of proteins among the trillions of possible combinations. Synthetic avenues for peptide generation became an important venue for drug creation in the 1980s.[6]/nIn 1985, Houghten's most cited paper (cited 650 times, according to Scopus) published his method for the synthesis of massive numbers of peptides\u2014enough for practical use in pharmacological work\u2014in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.[7] This method was referred to as the \"tea-bag\" method because deprotected peptides are enclosed in mesh bags and dipped quickly into liquid solutions containing activated amino acids (or other organic compounds). The peptide is thus elongated one amino acid at each step, and by careful movement of each teabag, a series of related peptides can be made.[8] By another variation, \"split and mix\", tens of millions of very diverse peptides can be made, and then assayed by some technique. Very precise deconvolution of the results, or alternatively, marking the peptide beads, can correlate sequence and activity. This allowed \"[the capture of] information in a day that you couldn't get in a hundred years before\" according to Houghten.[2]/nThe problem of generating and sequencing large libraries of peptides suitable for pharmaceutical work remained.  Selection and identification of specific desired molecular traits (e.g. antigen response, antimicrobial response) required a selection algorithm and process.  In 1991, he and his colleagues published one of the major papers in combinatorial biology\u2014the paper described a method to generate peptides capturable to contemporary protein microarrays through the creation of synthetic peptide combinatorial libraries (SPCL).[9]/nHoughten continued his work in combinatorial biology with an article in Methods, the journals section of Methods in Enzymology.  which is the standard multi-volume references set for biochemical methodology in research.[10][11]", "24292360": "Angelika Amon (January 10, 1967 \u2013 October 29, 2020) was an Austrian American molecular and cell biologist, and the Kathleen and Curtis Marble Professor in Cancer Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. Amon's research centered on how chromosomes are regulated, duplicated, and partitioned in the cell cycle.  Amon was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2017./nAmon was born and raised in Vienna, Austria.[10]  She displayed an early interest in plant and animal biology as a child, keeping a notebook full of newspaper clippings, and was motivated to study biology after learning about Mendelian genetics and seeing time-lapse micrographs of the division of plant cells in middle school.[10][12]/nAmon received an undergraduate degree in biology from the University of Vienna.[10]  She continued her doctoral work there beginning in 1989 under a newly hired Kim Nasmyth at the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP), receiving a PhD in 1993.[10]  Amon left Austria for the United States in 1994, joining the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts as a postdoctoral researcher.[10]  She was named a Whitehead Fellow in 1996, which allowed her to start her own laboratory at the Institute.[10][12]/nAmon's independent work at the Whitehead Institute led directly to her securing a faculty appointment at the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT in 1999,[10] the same year she received the Presidential Early Career Award and was named a Howard S. and Linda B. Stern Career Development Assistant Professor.[13]  Amon became an associate investigator for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 2000,[14] and was promoted to full professor at MIT in 2007; she had earlier achieved tenure as an assistant professor.[15]/nAmon was listed as a member of the Editorial Board for Current Biology in 2016,[16] but no longer appears in this position as of 2019.[17]  She served on the Scientific Advisory Board of the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP) from 2009 to 2019.[18]/nAmon was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2017, by which time she had been named the Kathleen and Curtis Marble Professor of Cancer Research at MIT.[19]  She was conferred the Vilcek Prize two years later, in recognition of her as one who had \"made extraordinary contributions to their fields\" while being a foreign-born researcher in the United States.[10]/nAmon was married to Johannes Weis.  Together, they had two daughters (Theresa and Clara).[12][20]  She died on October 29, 2020.

As a result, he suggests, newly acquired behaviours can be passed down to future generations\u2014a biological proposition akin to the Lamarckian inheritance theory. He generalises this approach to assert that it explains many aspects of science, from evolution to the laws of nature, which, in Sheldrake's formulation, are merely mutable habits that have been evolving and changing since the Big Bang.[citation needed]/nJohn Davy wrote in The Observer that the implications of A New Science of Life were \"fascinating and far-reaching, and would turn upside down a lot of orthodox science,\" and that they would \"merit attention if some of its predictions are supported by experiment.\"[61]/nIn subsequent books, Sheldrake continued to promote morphic resonance./nThe morphic resonance hypothesis is rejected by numerous critics on many grounds, and has been labelled pseudoscience and magical thinking. These grounds include the lack of evidence for it and its inconsistency with established scientific theories. The idea of morphic resonance is also seen as lacking scientific credibility because it is overly vague and unfalsifiable. Sheldrake's experimental methods have been criticised for being poorly designed and subject to experimenter bias. His analyses of results have also drawn criticism.[b]/nAlex Gomez-Marin denies that Sheldrake's basic idea is unfalsifiable, but no conclusive experiments have been performed since mainstream scientists do no wish to get involved in such experiments.[67]/nIn The Presence of the Past: Morphic Resonance and the Habits of Nature (1988), Sheldrake expands on his morphic resonance hypothesis and marshals experimental evidence that he says supports it.[15] The book was reviewed favourably in New Scientist by historian Theodore Roszak, who called it \"engaging, provocative\" and \"a tour de force.\"[68] When it was reissued in 2011 with those quotes on the front cover, New Scientist remarked, \"Back then, Roszak gave Sheldrake the benefit of the doubt. Today, attitudes have hardened and Sheldrake is seen as standing firmly on the wilder shores of science,\" adding that if New Scientist were to review the reissue, the book's publisher \"wouldn't be mining it for promotional purposes.\"[69]/nIn a 1988 review of the book in The Times, David E. H. Jones criticised the hypothesis as magical thinking and pseudoscience, saying that morphic resonance \"is so vast and formless that it could easily be made to explain anything, or to dodge round any opposing argument ... Sheldrake has sadly aligned himself with those fantasists who, from the depths of their armchairs, dream up whole new grandiose theories of space and time to revolutionize all science, drape their woolly generalizations over every phenomenon they can think of, and then start looking round for whatever scraps of evidence that seem to them to be in their favour.\" Jones argued that without confirmatory experimental evidence, \"the whole unwieldy and redundant structure of [Sheldrake's] theory falls to Occam's Razor.\"[22]/nPublished in 1991, Sheldrake's The Rebirth of Nature: The Greening of Science and God addresses the subject of New Age consciousness and related topics.[70][71] A column in The Guardian said that the book \"seeks to restore the pre-Enlightenment notion that nature is 'alive',\" quoting Sheldrake as saying that \"indeterminism, spontaneity and creativity have re-emerged throughout the natural world\" and that \"mystic, animistic and religious ways of thinking can no longer be kept at bay.\"[72] The book was reviewed by James Lovelock in Nature, who argued that \"the theory of formative causation makes testable predictions,\" noting that \"nothing has yet been reported which would divert the mainstream of science. ... Even if it is nonsense ... recognizing the need for fruitful errors, I do not regard the book as dangerous.\"[73]/nIn 1994, Sheldrake proposed a list of Seven Experiments That Could Change the World, subtitled \"A do-it-yourself guide to revolutionary science.\" He encouraged laypeople to conduct research and argued that experiments similar to his own could be conducted with limited expense.[74]/nMusic critic of The Sunday Times Mark Edwards reviewed the book positively, arguing that Sheldrake \"challenges the complacent certainty of scientists,\" and that his ideas \"sounded ridiculous ... as long as your thinking is constrained by the current scientific orthodoxy.\"[75]/nDavid Sharp, writing in The Lancet, said that the experiments testing paranormal phenomena carried the \"risk of positive publication bias,\" and that the scientific community \"would have to think again if some of these suggestions were convincingly confirmed.\" Sharp encouraged readers (medical professionals) to \"at least read Sheldrake, even try one of his experiments\u2014but pay very close attention to your methods section.\" Sharp doubted whether \"a bunch of enthusiastic amateurs [was] going to persuade sceptics,\" and noted that \"orthodox science will need a lot of convincing.\"[76]/nScience journalist Nigel Hawkes, writing in The Times, said that Sheldrake was \"trying to bridge the gap between phenomenalism and science,\" and suggested that dogs could appear to have psychic abilities when they were actually relying on more conventional senses. He concluded: \"whether scientists will be willing to take [Sheldrake] seriously is ... [a question] that need not concern most readers. While I do not think this book will change the world, it will cause plenty of harmless fun.\"[77]/nDogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home, published in 1999, covers his research into proposed telepathy between humans and animals, particularly dogs. Sheldrake suggests that such interspecies telepathy is a real phenomenon and that morphic fields are responsible for it.[78]/nThe book is in three sections, on telepathy, on sense of direction, including animal migration and the homing of pigeons, and on animal precognition, including premonitions of earthquakes and tsunamis. Sheldrake examined more than 1,000 case histories of dogs and cats that seemed to anticipate their owners' return by waiting at a door or window, sometimes for half an hour or more ahead of their return. He did a long series of experiments with a dog called Jaytee, in which the dog was filmed continuously during its owner's absence. In 100 filmed tests, on average the dog spent far more time at the window when its owner was on her way home than when she was not. During the main period of her absence, before she started her return journey, the dog was at the window for an average of 24 seconds per 10-minute period (4% of the time), whereas when she was on her way home, during the first ten minutes of her homeward journey, from more than five miles away, the dog was at the window for an average of five minutes 30 seconds (55% of the time). Sheldrake interpreted the result as highly significant statistically. He performed 12 more tests, in which the dog's owner travelled home in a taxi or other unfamiliar vehicle at randomly selected times communicated to her by telephone, to rule out the possibility that the dog was reacting to familiar car sounds or routines.[79] He also carried out similar experiments with another dog, Kane, describing the results as similarly positive and significant.[78]/nBefore the publication of Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home, Sheldrake invited Richard Wiseman, Matthew Smith, and Julie Milton to conduct an independent experimental study with Jaytee. They concluded that their evidence did not support telepathy as an explanation for the dog's behaviour,[80] and proposed possible alternative explanations for Sheldrake's conclusions, involving artefacts, bias resulting from experimental design, and post hoc analysis of unpublished data.[66][81] The group observed that Sheldrake's observed patterns could easily arise if a dog were simply to do very little for a while, before visiting a window with increasing frequency the longer its owner was absent, and that such behaviour would make sense for a dog awaiting its owner's return. Under this behaviour, the final measurement period, ending with the owner's return, would always contain the most time spent at the window.[66] Sheldrake argued that the actual data in his own and in Wiseman's tests did not bear this out, and that the dog went to wait at the window sooner when his owner was returning from a short absence, and later after a long absence, with no tendency for Jaytee to go to the window early in the way that he did for shorter absences.[82]/nReviewing the book, Susan Blackmore criticised Sheldrake for comparing the 12 tests of random duration\u2014which were all less than an hour long\u2014to the initial tests where the dog may have been responding to patterns in the owner's journeys. Blackmore interpreted the results of the randomised tests as starting with a period where the dog \"settles down and does not bother to go to the window,\" and then showing that the longer the owner was away, the more the dog went to look.[79]/nSheldrake's The Sense of Being Stared At explores telepathy, precognition, and the \"psychic staring effect.\" It reported on an experiment Sheldrake conducted where blindfolded subjects guessed whether persons were staring at them or at another target. He reported subjects exhibiting a weak sense of being stared at, but no sense of not being stared at,[83][84] and attributed the results to morphic resonance.[85] He reported a hit rate of 53.1%, describing two subjects as \"nearly always right, scoring way above chance levels.\"[86]/nSeveral independent experimenters were unable to find evidence beyond statistical randomness that people could tell they were being stared at, with some saying that there were design flaws in Sheldrake's experiments,[11][26][87] such as using test sequences with \"relatively few long runs and many alternations\" instead of truly randomised patterns.[88][89] In 2005, Michael Shermer expressed concern over confirmation bias and experimenter bias in the tests, and concluded that Sheldrake's claim was unfalsifiable.[90]/nDavid Jay Brown, who conducted some of the experiments for Sheldrake, states that one of the subjects who was reported as having the highest hit rates was under the influence of the drug MDMA (Ecstasy) during the trials.[91]/nThe Science Delusion, published in the US as Science Set Free: 10 Paths to New Discovery, summarises much of Sheldrake's previous work and encapsulates it into a broader critique of philosophical materialism, with the title apparently mimicking that of The God Delusion by one of his critics, Richard Dawkins.[92]/nIn the book, Sheldrake proposes a number of questions as the theme of each chapter that seek to elaborate on his central premise that science is predicated on the belief that the nature of reality is fully understood, with only minor details needing to be filled in. This \"delusion\" is what Sheldrake argues has turned science into a series of dogmas grounded in philosophical materialism rather than an open-minded approach to investigating phenomena. He argues that many powerful taboos circumscribe what scientists can legitimately direct their attention towards.[93]:\u200a6\u201312\u200a The mainstream view of modern science is that it proceeds by methodological naturalism and does not require philosophical materialism.[94]/nSheldrake questions conservation of energy; he calls it a \"standard scientific dogma,\"[93]:\u200a337\u200a says that perpetual motion devices and inedia should be investigated as possible phenomena,[93]:\u200a72\u201373\u200a and has said that \"the evidence for energy conservation in living organisms is weak.\"[93]:\u200a83\u200a He argues in favour of alternative medicine and psychic phenomena, saying that their recognition as legitimate is impeded by a \"scientific priesthood\" with an \"authoritarian mentality.\"[93]:\u200a327\u200a Citing his earlier \"psychic staring effect\" experiments and other reasons, he says that minds are not confined to brains and that \"liberating minds from confinement in heads is like being released from prison.\"[93]:\u200a229\u200a He suggests that DNA is insufficient to explain inheritance, and that inheritance of form and behaviour is mediated through morphic resonance.[93]:\u200a157\u2013186\u200a He also promotes morphic resonance in broader fashion as an explanation for other phenomena such as memory.[93]:\u200a187\u2013211/nReviews were mixed. Anti-reductionist philosopher Mary Midgley, writing in The Guardian, welcomed it as \"a new mind-body paradigm\" to address what she called \"the unlucky fact that our current form of mechanistic materialism rests on muddled, outdated notions of matter.\"[95] Philosopher Martin Cohen, a famous critic of esotericism in science, wrote in The Times Higher Education Supplement that \"[t]here is a lot to be said for debunking orthodox science's pretensions to be on the verge of fitting the last grain of information into its towering edifice of universal knowledge\", while also noting that Sheldrake \"goes a bit too far here and there, as in promoting his morphic resonance theory.\"[96]/nBryan Appleyard writing in The Sunday Times commented that Sheldrake was \"at his most incisive\" when making a \"broad critique of contemporary science\" and \"scientism,\" but on Sheldrake's \"own scientific theories\" Appleyard noted that \"morphic resonance is widely derided and narrowly supported. Most of the experimental evidence is contested, though Sheldrake argues there are 'statistically significant' results.\" Appleyard called it \"highly speculative\" and was unsure \"whether it makes sense or not.\"[97]/nOther reviews were less favourable. New Scientist's deputy editor Graham Lawton characterised Science Set Free as \"woolly credulousness\" and chided Sheldrake for \"uncritically embracing all kinds of fringe ideas.\"[98] A review in Philosophy Now called the book \"disturbingly eccentric,\" combining \"a disorderly collage of scientific fact and opinion with an intrusive yet disjunctive metaphysical programme.\"[99]/nReviews for the book were mostly positive. Kirkus Reviews described it as a \"grounded and inspiring approach to appreciating the benefits of both science and religion\".[100] Adam Ford, reviewing the book for the Church Times, describes it as a \"useful and very clear introduction to the practice of meditation\" combined with a how-to guide on the \"healing and happiness-creating power of gratitude\".[101]/nPublishers Weekly reviewed the book as having \"accessible suggestions\" and \"clear arguments\", while noting that \"a few fuzzy moments, including reliance on many...overly speculative accounts\" do not prevent the work from being \"otherwise convincing\" and \"a good case for reincorporating bygone spiritual habits.\"[102]/nReviews for the book were mixed. In The Daily Telegraph, journalist Steven Poole called Sheldrake's writing \"very engaging\" and said his defense of prayer worked \"sometimes, but not always\" and was \"not really good enough\".[103] Veterinary surgeon and barrister Charles A. Foster, writing in Literary Review, called the book \"a very mixed bag\" but also \"funny, wise, [and] full of whimsical weirdness\".[104]/nWriting in the Times Literary Supplement, anthropologist Jonathan Benthall called the book \"an affable, erudite manual to show how life need not be boring\", and Sheldrake's arguments \"soft at the edges, sometimes presenting his hypotheses as facts\".[105]/nSheldrake's ideas have been discussed in academic journals and books. His work has also received popular coverage through newspapers, radio, television and speaking engagements. The attention he receives has raised concerns that it adversely affects the public understanding of science.[3][7][20][25] Some have accused Sheldrake of self-promotion,[25] with Steven Rose commenting, \"for the inventors of such hypotheses the rewards include a degree of instant fame which is harder to achieve by the humdrum pursuit of more conventional science.\"[20]/nA variety of responses to Sheldrake's ideas have appeared in prominent scientific publications./nSheldrake and theoretical physicist David Bohm published a dialogue in 1982 in which they compared Sheldrake's ideas to Bohm's implicate order.[106] In 1997, physicist Hans-Peter D\u00fcrr speculated about Sheldrake's work in relation to modern physics.[107]/nFollowing the publication of A New Science of Life, New Scientist sponsored a competition to devise empirical tests for morphic resonance.[68] The winning idea involved learning Turkish nursery rhymes, with psychologist and broadcaster Sue Blackmore's entry involving babies' behaviour coming second.[24] Blackmore found the results did not support morphic resonance.[24]/nIn 2005, the Journal of Consciousness Studies devoted a special issue to Sheldrake's work on the sense of being stared at.[26] For this issue, the editor could not follow the journal's standard peer-review process because \"making successful blind peer review a condition of publication would in this case have killed the project at the outset.\"[108] The issue thus featured several articles by Sheldrake, followed by the open peer review, to which Sheldrake then responded.[26] Writing in Scientific American, Michael Shermer rated the peer commentaries, and noted that the more supportive reviews came from those who had affiliations with less mainstream institutions.[26]/nSheldrake denies that DNA contains a recipe for morphological development. He and developmental biologist Lewis Wolpert have made a scientific wager about the importance of DNA in the developing organism. Wolpert bet Sheldrake \"a case of fine port\" that \"By 1 May 2029, given the genome of a fertilised egg of an animal or plant, we will be able to predict in at least one case all the details of the organism that develops from it, including any abnormalities.\" The Royal Society will be asked to determine the winner if the result is not obvious.[109]/nIn September 1981, Nature published an editorial about A New Science of Life entitled \"A book for burning?\"[2][7] Written by the journal's senior editor, John Maddox, the editorial commented:/nSheldrake's book is a splendid illustration of the widespread public misconception of what science is about. In reality, Sheldrake's argument is in no sense a scientific argument but is an exercise in pseudo-science ... Many readers will be left with the impression that Sheldrake has succeeded in finding a place for magic within scientific discussion\u2014and this, indeed, may have been a part of the objective of writing such a book.[7]/nMaddox argued that Sheldrake's hypothesis was not testable or \"falsifiable in Popper's sense,\" referring to the philosopher Karl Popper. He said Sheldrake's proposals for testing his hypothesis were \"time-consuming, inconclusive in the sense that it will always be possible to account for another morphogenetic field and impractical.\"[7] In the editorial, Maddox ultimately rejected the suggestion that the book should be burned.[7] Nonetheless, the title of the piece garnered widespread publicity.[110][25][27] In a subsequent issue, Nature published several letters expressing disapproval of the editorial,[111][112][113][114] including one from physicist Brian Josephson, who criticised Maddox for \"a failure to admit even the possibility that genuine physical facts may exist which lie outside the scope of current scientific descriptions.\"[111]/nIn 1983, an editorial in The Guardian compared the \"petulance of wrath of the scientific establishment\" aimed against Sheldrake with the Galileo affair and Lysenkoism.[115] Responding in the same paper, Brian Charlesworth defended the scientific establishment, affirming that \"the ultimate test of a scientific theory is its conformity with the observations and experiments\" and that \"vitalistic and Lamarckian ideas which [The Guardian] seem to regard so highly have repeatedly failed this test.\"[116]/nIn a letter to The Guardian in 1988, a scientist from Glasgow University referred to the title \"A book for burning?\" as \"posing the question to attract attention\" and criticised the \"perpetuation of the myth that Maddox ever advocated the burning of Sheldrake's book.\"[117] In 1999, Maddox characterised his 1981 editorial as \"injudicious,\" saying that even though it concluded that Sheldrake's book/nshould not be burned ... but put firmly in its place among the literature of intellectual aberration. ... The publicists for Sheldrake's publishers were nevertheless delighted with the piece, using it to suggest that the Establishment (Nature) was again up to its old trick of suppressing uncomfortable truths.[110]/nAn editor for Nature said in 2009 that Maddox's reference to book burning backfired.[25]/nIn 2012, Sheldrake described his time after Maddox's review as being \"exactly like a papal excommunication. From that moment on, I became a very dangerous person to know for scientists.\"[2]/nDuring 1987 and 1988 Sheldrake contributed several pieces to The Guardian's \"Body and Soul\" column. In one of these, he wrote that the idea that \"memories were stored in our brains\" was \"only a theory\" and \"despite decades of research, the phenomenon of memory remains mysterious.\"[118] This provoked a response by Steven Rose, a neuroscientist from the Open University, who criticised Sheldrake for being \"a researcher trained in another discipline\" (botany) for not \"respect[ing] the data collected by neuroscientists before begin[ning] to offer us alternative explanations,\" and accused Sheldrake of \"ignoring or denying\" \"massive evidence,\" and arguing that \"neuroscience over the past two decades has shown that memories are stored in specific changes in brain cells.\" Giving an example of experiments on chicks, Rose asserted \"egregious errors that Sheldrake makes to bolster his case that demands a new vague but all-embracing theory to resolve.\"[27]/nSheldrake responded to Rose's article, stating that there was experimental evidence that showed that \"memories can survive the destruction of the putative memory traces.\"[119] Rose responded, asking Sheldrake to \"get his facts straight,\" explaining the research and concluding that \"there is no way that this straightforward and impressive body of evidence can be taken to imply that memories are not in the brain, still less that the brain is tuning into some indeterminate, undefined, resonating and extra-corporeal field.\"[120]/nIn his next column, Sheldrake again attacked Rose for following \"materialism,\" and argued that quantum physics had \"overturned\" materialism, and suggested that \"memories may turn out to depend on morphic resonance rather than memory traces.\"[121] Philosopher Alan Malachowski of the University of East Anglia, responding to what he called Sheldrake's \"latest muddled diatribe,\" defended materialism, argued that Sheldrake dismissed Rose's explanation with an \"absurd rhetorical comparison,\" asserted that quantum physics was compatible with materialism, and argued that \"being roughly right about great many things has given [materialists] the confidence to be far more open minded than he is prepared to give them credit for.\"[122]/nIn 1990, Sheldrake and Rose agreed to and arranged a test of the morphic resonance hypothesis using chicks.[123][124] They were unable to agree on the intended joint research paper reporting their results,[124] instead publishing separate and conflicting interpretations. Sheldrake published a paper stating that the results matched his prediction that day-old chicks would be influenced by the experiences of previous batches of day-old chicks\u2014\"From the point of view of the hypothesis of formative causation, the results of this experiment are encouraging\"\u2014and called for further research.[125] Rose wrote that morphic resonance was a \"hypothesis disconfirmed.\"[20] He also made further criticisms of morphic resonance, and stated that \"the experience of this collaboration has convinced me in practice, Sheldrake is so committed to his hypothesis that it is very hard to envisage the circumstances in which he would accept its disconfirmation.\"[20] Rose asked Patrick Bateson to analyse the data, and Bateson offered his opinion that Sheldrake's interpretation of the data was \"misleading\" and attributable to experimenter effects.[20]/nSheldrake responded to Rose's paper by describing it as \"polemic\" and \"aggressive tone and extravagant rhetoric\" and concluding: \"The results of this experiment do not disconfirm the hypothesis of formative causation, as Rose claims. They are consistent with it.\"[126]/nSheldrake was the subject of an episode of Heretics of Science, a six-part documentary series broadcast on BBC2 in 1994.[127] In this episode, John Maddox discussed \"A book for burning?,\" his 1981 Nature editorial review of Sheldrake's book, A New Science of Life: The Hypothesis of Morphic Resonance. Maddox said that morphic resonance \"is not a scientific theory. Sheldrake is putting forward magic instead of science, and that can be condemned with exactly the language that the popes used to condemn Galileo, and for the same reasons: it is heresy.\"[128] The broadcast repeatedly displayed footage of book burning, sometimes accompanied by audio of a crowd chanting \"heretic.\"[128] Biologist Steven Rose criticised the broadcast for focusing on Maddox's rhetoric as if it was \"all that mattered.\" \"There wasn't much sense of the scientific or metascientific issues at stake,\" Rose said.[129]/nAn experiment involving measuring the time for subjects to recognise hidden images, with morphic resonance being posited to aid in recognition, was conducted in 1984 by the BBC popular science programme Tomorrow's World. In the outcome of the experiment, one set of data yielded positive results and another set yielded negative results.[128]/nSheldrake debated with biologist Lewis Wolpert on the existence of telepathy in 2004 at the Royal Society of Arts in London.[130] Sheldrake argued for telepathy while Wolpert argued that telepathy fits Irving Langmuir's definition of pathological science and that the evidence for telepathy has not been persuasive.[131] Reporting on the event, New Scientist said \"it was clear the audience saw Wolpert as no more than a killjoy. (...) There are sound reasons for doubting Sheldrake's data. One is that some parapsychology experimenters have an uncanny knack of finding the effect they are looking for. There is no suggestion of fraud, but something is going on, and science demands that it must be understood before conclusions can be drawn about the results.\"[130]/nIn 2006, Sheldrake spoke at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science about experimental results on telepathy replicated by \"a 1980s girl band,\" drawing criticism from Peter Atkins, Lord Winston, and Richard Wiseman. The Royal Society also reacted to the event, saying, \"Modern science is based on a rigorous evidence-based process involving experiment and observation. The results and interpretations should always be exposed to robust peer review.\"[132]/nIn April 2008, Sheldrake was stabbed by a man during a lecture in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The man told a reporter that he thought Sheldrake had been using him as a \"guinea pig\" in telepathic mind control experiments for over five years.[133] Sheldrake suffered a wound to the leg and has recovered,[133][134] while his assailant was found \"guilty but mentally ill.\"[135]/nIn January 2013, Sheldrake gave a TEDx lecture at TEDxWhitechapel in East London roughly summarising ideas from his book, The Science Delusion. In his talk, he said that modern science rests on ten dogmas that \"fall apart\" upon examination and promoted his hypothesis of morphic resonance. According to a statement by TED staff, TED's scientific advisors \"questioned whether his list is a fair description of scientific assumptions\" and believed that \"there is little evidence for some of Sheldrake's more radical claims, such as his theory of morphic resonance.\" The advisors recommended that the talk \"not be distributed without being framed with caution.\" The video of the talk was moved from the TEDx YouTube channel to the TED blog accompanied by the framing language called for by the advisors. The move and framing prompted accusations of censorship, to which TED responded by saying the accusations were \"simply not true\" and that Sheldrake's talk was \"up on our website.\"[136][137]/nIn November 2013, Sheldrake gave a lecture at the Oxford Union outlining his claims, made in The Science Delusion, that modern science has become constrained by dogma, particularly in physics.[138]/nBetween 1989 and 1999, Sheldrake, ethnobotanist Terence McKenna and mathematician Ralph Abraham recorded a series of discussions exploring diverse topics relating to the \"world soul\" and evolution.[139] These resulted in a number of books based on the discussions: Trialogues at the Edge of the West: Chaos, Creativity and the Resacralization of the World (1992), The Evolutionary Mind: Trialogues at the Edge of the Unthinkable (1998), and The Evolutionary Mind: Conversations on Science, Imagination & Spirit (2005). In an interview for the book Conversations on the Edge of the Apocalypse, Sheldrake says he believes the use of psychedelic drugs \"can reveal a world of consciousness and interconnection\", which he says he has experienced.[140] Alternative medicine advocate Deepak Chopra is a supporter of Sheldrake's work.[141][142]/nSheldrake's work was amongst those cited in a faux research paper written by Alan Sokal and submitted to Social Text.[143] In 1996, the journal published the paper as if it represented real scientific research,[144] an event that has come to be known as the Sokal affair. Sokal later said that he had suggested in the hoax paper that 'morphogenetic fields' constituted a cutting-edge theory of quantum gravity, adding that \"This connection [was] pure invention; even Sheldrake makes no such claim.\"[143]/nSheldrake has been described as a New Age author,[12][13][14] but does not endorse certain New Age interpretations of his ideas.[145]/nThe 2009 Zero Escape video game Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors was inspired by Sheldrake's morphogenetic field theories.[146][147]/nAmong his early influences Sheldrake cites The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962) by Thomas Kuhn. He has said the book led him to view contemporary scientific understanding of life as simply a paradigm, which he called \"the mechanistic theory of life.\" Reading Kuhn's work, Sheldrake says, focused his mind on how scientific paradigms can change.[16]/nSheldrake says that although there are similarities between morphic resonance and Hinduism's akashic records,[148] he first conceived of the idea while at Cambridge, before his travel to India, where he later developed it. He attributes the origin of his idea to two influences: his studies of the holistic tradition in biology, and French philosopher Henri Bergson's 1896 book Matter and Memory. He says he took Bergson's concept of memories not being materially embedded in the brain and generalised it to morphic resonance, where memories are not only immaterial but also under the influence of the collective memories of similar organisms. While his colleagues at Cambridge were not receptive to the idea, Sheldrake found the opposite to be true in India. He recounts his Indian colleagues saying, \"There's nothing new in this, it was all known millennia ago to the ancient rishis.\" Sheldrake thus characterises morphic resonance as a convergence between Western and Eastern thought, yet found by himself first in Western philosophy.[15][149]/nSheldrake has also noted similarities between morphic resonance and Carl Jung's collective unconscious, with regard to collective memories being shared across individuals and the coalescing of particular behaviours through repetition, which Jung called archetypes.[15] But whereas Jung assumed that archetypal forms were transmitted through physical inheritance, Sheldrake attributes collective memories to morphic resonance, and rejects any explanation of them involving what he terms \"mechanistic biology.\"/nLewis Wolpert, one of Sheldrake's critics, has described morphic resonance as an updated Drieschian vitalism.[28][150]/nSheldrake is married to therapist, voice teacher and author Jill Purce.[151] They have two sons,[45] biologist Merlin Sheldrake and musician Cosmo Sheldrake.[152][153]/nSheldrake is a practicing Anglican.[154] He has said that he studied with a Sufi teacher and practiced Sufism while he was in India.[33] Sheldrake reported \"being drawn back to a Christian path\" during his time in India.[1]/nWith Ralph Abraham and Terence McKenna:/nWith Matthew Fox:/nWith Kate Banks:/nWith Michael Shermer:", "67873857": "Rachel Ashegbofe Ikemeh is a Nigerian conservationist[1][2] who won a Whitley award in 2020.[3][4][5] She is the director[6]\nof South West and Niger Delta Forest Project, a conservation program for endangered primates as the Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee, Red colobus monkey(Piliocolobus epieni) and Benin potto in the respective regions.[7] She has actively been in Nigeria conservation for the past 15 years.[8][9]/nIkemeh has been involved in the establishment of two protected areas in Nigeria: a IUCN category II PA in Ekiti State[10] and a community conservation area in Bayelsa State,[11] Niger Delta, Nigeria./nThis biographical article about an activist from Nigeria is a stub.

He was the only student of Sergei Winogradsky and succeeded him as head of the department of General Microbiology at the Institute of Experimental Medicine in Saint Petersburg./nOmelianski was the youngest son of a college teacher in Zhytomyr. In 1885 or 1886, Omelianski enrolled in the natural history division of the physico-mathematical faculty of the University of Saint Petersburg.[1][2] During his studies he visited the lectures of D. I. Mendeleev and N. A. Menshutkin.[2]/nAfter finishing his studies with distinction in 1889 or 1890, he worked in the chemical laboratory of Menshutkin for further two years and published the first time. In 1891, financial difficulties forced Omelianski to work as laboratory chemist in a metallurgical factory in Southern Russia.[1] However, two years later he became the assistant of S. N. Winogradsky, who hired him on recommendation of Menshutkin, at the new-founded Imperial Institute of Experimental Medicine. Omelianski supported Winogradskys work on nitrification. Later on he studied the fermentation of cellulose and did research on nitrogen fixation on his own.[2]/nIn 1909, he published the textbook \"Principles of Microbiology\"[1] (\u041e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b \u043c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0438) which was the first original Russian textbook on microbiology and remained a standard work at Soviet universities till the 1950s. Omelianski had conceived this text from his lectures he held on a women's college since 1906 or 1909.[2] In 1922, he published his second textbook \"Practical Manual of Microbiology\"[1] (\u041f\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0440\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043f\u043e \u043c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0438) in which he spread the methodology of Winogradsky (using enrichment cultures) and the so-called \"Delft school of microbiology\"[3] (founded by M. Beijerinck) in Russia.[2] Since 1912 till his death he led the department of General Microbiology at the Institute of Experimental Medicine succeeding Winogradsky. As head of the department he edited the \"Archive of Biological Sciences\" (\u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0432 \u0431\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a), the first biology journal publishing in Russian.

In 1923, he became of full member of the Russian Academy of Sciences.[2] In 1926, he affiliated with the Society of American Bacteriologists[1] and the Lombardic Academical Society./nOmelianski was married and had a daughter, Maria Vasilevna Stepanova (1901-1946, an ethnographer).[2] During World War I, the Russian Revolution and Russian Civil War, Omelianski was able to stay in Saint Petersburg, while Winogradsky (as a rich landowner) had to escape. Possibly, he was saved by his poor bourgeois ancestry, his interest in the starving poor, his popular commitment by publishing Russian text books and journals and lecturing in a women\u2019s college or thanks to the Bolsheviks scientific progress friendly stance. In springtime 1927, Omelianski travelled to the Pasteur Institute in Paris to visit his mentor Winogradsky. There he suffered a first heart attack. Omelianski had a second heart attack in December 1927 but could recover.[2] During a vacation in Gagra (Abkhazia) he died on April 21, 1928.[1] Omelianski was also a gifted chess player who entered into competitions as a student, a reportedly gifted portraitist and wrote several short-stories, four of which have since been stored in the archive at the Russian Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg.[2]/nOmelianski published only once in English on \u201caroma-producing microorganisms\u201d in the American Journal of Bacteriology in 1923.[4] However, today his international reputation is connected to microbial methanogenesis in syntrophic co-cultures.[5] This is based on his French publication of 1916 on \"methane fermentation of ethanol\".[6] Following this research, microbiologist Horace Barker isolated an ethanol-degrading microbe called Methanobacterium omelianskii.[7] Barker had used the methodological approach of the \"Delft school of  microbiology\"[3] developed by Barkers mentors Albert Kluyver and Cornelis van Niel. In 1967, the renamed Methanobacterium omelianskii was specified as a co-culture of the ethanol-oxidizing S-organism and a methanogen, which uses hydrogen produced by its bacterial partner to reduce carbon dioxide to methane.[8] Certainly, Omelianski was one of the founding fathers of methanogenesis research and the first scientist investigating methanogenic fermentation of cellulose and ethanol systematically. He even discovered hydrogen as a product of cellulose fermentation around 1900 but, of course, did not discover the concept of syntrophic electron transfer.[2]", "71248996": "Tang K.

He is the principal investigator of the Earths in Other Solar Systems team of NASA's Nexus for Exoplanet System Studies and the Hubble Space Telescope Cloud Atlas Treasury program, and Project EDEN, a large survey for habitable planets in the immediate solar neighborhood. He is leading the Nautilus Space Observatory space telescope concept and co-leading the technology development underpinning it./nDaniel Apai was born in Szeged, Hungary in 1977 and grew up in Budapest, Hungary. \nHe studied physics at the University of Szeged, Hungary and the University of Jena, Germany, and received a diploma as research physicist in 2000. After graduation, he was awarded a German Academic Exchange Service Doctoral Fellowship and began his doctoral studies at the University of Jena, under the supervision of Thomas Henning on observational studies of young stars. In 2002 he moved to the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, Heidelberg, Germany and he received his Ph.D. from the University of Heidelberg in 2004. In 2004 he was the recipient of the Patzer Price. Between 2004 and 2008 Daniel Apai has worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Steward Observatory's NASA Astrobiology Institute node on high-contrast adaptive optics direct imaging searches for extrasolar planets. In 2008, Apai took on a position at the Space Telescope Science Institute as an assistant astronomer at the institute's Science Policy Group. In 2011, he moved back to faculty of the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory and Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, where he is full professor since 2021. He also held short-term visiting positions at The University of Texas, at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, Heidelberg, and at The University of Bern./nApai's work includes detailed comparative studies of planet formation around sun-like stars and low-mass stars; his team has discovered that the structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks depends on stellar mass. He used, for the first time, multi-epoch near-infrared radial velocity measurements to demonstrate that many O-type stars have massive companions at the time of their formation. Apai has also used the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope to carry out pioneering observations to map condensate clouds in brown dwarf and exoplanet atmospheres. These studies demonstrated that brown dwarfs at the L- to T spectral type transition have clouds with varying thickness,[1] and that many brown dwarfs have zonal circulation and planetary-scale waves.[2] Daniel Apai was also a member of the team that discovered and imaged the super-jupiter Beta Pictoris b around the star Beta Pictoris./nIn 2016, Apai assembled a group of optical scientists, astrophysicists, and aerospace engineers to address a key technological challenge to scaling up astronomical space telescopes, with the goal of proposing a novel space telescope to NASA to survey a thousand extrasolar planets for atmospheric signatures of life (biosignatures). This effort led to the successful development of a new optical technology, Multi-Order Diffractive Engineered Material (MODE) lenses, that combine refraction with diffraction to form high-quality images with an ultra-light optical element that can be cost-effectively fabricated. By replacing expensive and technologically challenging primary mirrors, the MODE technology has the potential to enable production of low-cost but large-aperture space telescopes. In an \u2018\u2019Astronomical Journal\u2019\u2019 paper published in 2019, Apai and his team described a large and relatively low-cost array of identical unit telescopes that combines light incoherently, providing a light-collecting area equivalent of a single 50 m-diameter telescope. This concept is named the Nautilus Space Observatory (aka Nautilus Deep Space Observatory). With a light-collecting area about 100 times greater than that of the James Webb Space Telescope and ten times greater than that of the LUVOIR space telescope concept, Nautilus Deep Space Observatory is designed to survey extrasolar planets for biosignatures in a 10\u2013100 times larger sample than other space telescope concepts yet envisioned.

He spent over 35 years developing numerous scientific breakthroughs under the Johns Hopkins Medical School and Hospital./nGey was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on July 6, 1899, the son of German immigrants Frank and Emma Gey. He had an older brother and younger sister. Gey's parents immigrated from Germany, and according to the 1910 United States Census, they lived in suburban Pittsburgh./nGey graduated Peabody High School, and received undergraduate degree in biology from the University of Pittsburgh in 1920.[1] He worked as a carpenter and a mason to help pay his way through college.[2] \nAround 1926, he married Margaret K. (1900\u20131989), and they later moved to Baltimore where he would earn his medical degree from Johns Hopkins University. Gey was in medical school off and on for eight years, as he kept running out of money to pay for the tuition.[2]/nAfter graduating Hopkins in 1933, Gey immediately began his 37-year teaching career at the Johns Hopkins Medical School.[1]/nIn 1951, Gey's research assistant, Mary Kubicek, isolated cells from a cervical tumor removed by a surgeon found in a woman named Henrietta Lacks. These cells proved to be very unusual in that they could grow in culture medium which was constantly stirred using the roller drum a technique developed by Gey; they did not need a glass surface to grow, and therefore they had no space limit.[3] Once Gey realized the longevity and hardiness of these cells which he called  HeLa cells, he began sharing them with scientists all over the world, and the use of the HeLa cell line became widespread.[4] The cells were used in the development of the polio vaccine, led to the first clone of a human cell, helped in the discovery that humans have 46 chromosomes, and were used to develop in vitro fertilization. By the time Gey published a short abstract claiming some credit for the development of the line, the cells were already being used by scientists all over the world.[5]/nDue to the unusual growth capabilities of the HeLa cell line, it also contaminated many cell cultures and ruined years of research, as discovered by Stanley Gartler in 1966.[3] The cells, as it turned out, could float on dust particles and could be transferred on unwashed hands or used pipettes, and therefore end up in other cell cultures.[6] Because the cells were so pervasive, just one could lead to the complete takeover of a culture./nGey and his wife developed their own cell culture medium which would preserve cell lines, but their greatest obstacle was contamination.[7] George's biology training did not prepare him for contamination issues that may arise in certain instances, so his wife Margaret was the one who educated him on this topic.[7] Their cell culture recipe was constantly changing and being modified, but one recipe contained unusual ingredients such as chicken blood and cow fetuses.[7] This is how he and his wife came up with the \"Chicken Bleeding Technique\", and the process was eventually recorded for other researchers interested in the technique.[7] The \"Chicken Bleeding Technique\" was a way to draw blood from a chicken, which involved forcefully pinning down a chicken by the feet and the neck onto a butcher block and inserting a syringe needle into the chicken's heart.[7]/nDuring Gey's tenure at Johns Hopkins, he founded and was the first president of the Tissue Culture Association (TCA). The main object of the TCA was to introduce scientists to tissue, culture methodology, and train technical personnel. TCA is known today as the Society for In Vitro Biology, which currently[when?] embraces over 1,500 members. Through years of fundraising Gey was able to raise the millions of dollars needed to open the permanent home for the TCA,  W. Alton Jones Cell Science Center at Lake Placid, New York.[8] A few of the medical advances achieved through the TCA include the clone growth of rodent cells, the development of time lapse cinematography, and the electron microscopic examination of cell structures./nThere has been controversy surrounding how the cells were retrieved, as made famous by the book, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, since the cells were taken from Henrietta Lacks without her knowledge or permission; a serious breach of medical ethics, and her family remained unaware until the 1970s. Gey was careful to keep her actual name secret, and it was not made public until after his death.[3]/nGey and his wife had two children, George O. Gey Jr. and Frances Green.[9] George O. Gey Jr., became a cardiologist, completing his internship and residency at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center.[10]/nOn November 8, 1970, Gey died from pancreatic cancer in Baltimore, Maryland, less than a year after his initial diagnosis. When undergoing an emergency procedure for his cancer, doctors found that the cancer had spread to his lymph nodes, lungs and heart, thus making his cancer inoperable. Gey traveled to New York City to enroll himself in an experimental chemotherapy trial.[4] He wanted doctors to try to cut out a piece of the cancer in his pancreas to grow a new cell line for cancer research. The doctors, however, found the cancer had spread to so many organs that it was too dangerous to remove any for research purposes. Gey was \"furious\" upon learning of this.[3]/nGey is credited for creating the roller drum, which was essential for the development of the HeLa cell line. This machine was one of the first to help nurture cell cultures.  The roller drum consisted of various holes where tissues and their appropriate growth substances were all located.  The drum spun in order to mix the substances and once an hour allow the cultures to be exposed to the environment until the drum rolled again and rebathed the cells in liquid.[citation needed]/nGey is also noted to be one of the first to document cell division and growth on film.  He devised a time lapse camera that stood twelve feet, built out of spare parts from a nearby junkyard, with a temperature controlled incubator.[citation needed]/nAn important legacy Gey left on the scientific world was his teaching. In his lab, the belief was that \"the way to kill your cell cultures was by using a sloppy technique\".[4] He trained hundreds of researchers around the world in his sterile techniques and introduced the world to cautious studies. Although Gey was not given the chance to publish papers on his research or create patents before his untimely death, he left a legacy of understanding cancer, and began the foundation from which cancer research and cell culture has grown from.[4]/nIn 1954, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center selected Gey to receive the Katherine Burken Judd Award for his contributions to cancer research.[11] He won the Wien Award for Cancer Cytology in 1956.[12]", "28322928": "Harold Samuel \"Harry\" Ginsberg (May 27, 1917 \u2013 February 2, 2003) was an American microbiologist who made early discoveries in virology and infectious disease./nGinsberg was born on May 27, 1917, in Daytona Beach, Florida.

There he discovered a pattern of hepatitis infections in those individuals who had received blood transfusions. Further investigation showed that the patients had contracted Hepatitis B from pooled plasma, which led to changes in transfusion practices and resulted in a significant reduction in illness and death among soldiers being treated.[3] In recognition of these efforts, he was awarded the Legion of Merit in 1945.[1]/nAfter completing his military service, he was an associate at the Rockefeller Institute in New York City starting in 1946. He was on the faculty of Western Reserve University starting in 1951, where research he conducted showed that adenoviruses, which could lie dormant in the adenoids for extended periods, were among the causes of atypical pneumonia and acute respiratory disease. Ginsberg showed the process by which the adenovirus caused disease after entering host cells, leading to the creation of vaccines against various infectious diseases and showing how cancers could be triggered by oncoviruses.[3]/nHe moved to the University of Pennsylvania in 1960 and Columbia University in 1973, heading each school's department of microbiology. Based on research done investigating the spread of acute respiratory distress syndrome in groups of Army recruits, Ginsberg's research on the protein structure of adenovirues led to the development of gene therapy in which working copies of genes can be implanted into the human body by way of genetically modified adenoviruses.

She joined a Marxist group in St Petersburg in 1894, and married a fellow Marxist, Panteleimon Nikolaievich Lepeshinsky (1868\u20131944), a priest's son who was expelled from St Petersburg University in 1895 for his political activities. They were both arrested and exiled in 1897, for three years, to Yermakovsk, in Siberia, 32 kilometers from Minusinsk, where Lenin was in exile. Both became loyal supporters of Lenin and joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) when it was founded, in 1898. After Lenin had launched the newspaper Iskra, they acted as its agents in Pskov north west Russia, until 1903, when they emigrated to Geneva and opened a cafe.

Later she claimed that cells could propagate by disintegration into granules which could generate new forms of cells, different from the parental cells. Also, crystals of inorganic matter could be converted into cells by adding nucleic acids. Further, she espoused spontaneous generation and the presence of a \"vital substance\".[4] These claims were propagated as official dogma in the Soviet Union.[3] A claim that soda baths fostered rejuvenation led to a temporary shortage of baking soda.[4] She based her career on claims to observe de novo emergence of living cells from non-cellular materials, supporting such claims with fabricated proofs which were \"confirmed\" by others eager to advance in the politicized scientific system. In reality, she filmed the death and subsequent decomposition of cells, then projected these films reversed./nOn May 22\u201324, 1950 at the special symposium \"Live Matter and Cell Development\" for the USSR Academy of Sciences and the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences that was supported by Stalin and chaired by Alexander Oparin, Lepeshinskaya gave the keynote speech, and her \"discoveries\" were celebrated as revolutionary by the invited audience.[3][4] She was the recipient of the Stalin Prize for that year, and her ideas became mandatory instruction in biology. In 1952 a second conference took place to demonstrate \"using experimental methods\" that the bourgeois Virchowian concept of cell development (only a living cell can produce another cell) was replaced by a \"new dialectical-materialistic theory on the origin of all living cells from non-living matter.\"[5] While her impact and dogmatic dominance have parallels to those of Lysenko, her claims were never officially renounced, instead they just faded away./nShe involved her daughter Olga and her son-in-law Vladimir Kryukov in her work; in contrast, her husband, Panteleimon Lepechinsky, thought little of it. \"Don\u2019t you listen to her.

Indeed, defects in genes that repair DNA damage are the underlying cause of a number of hereditary ageing/cancer predisposition syndromes such as Fanconi anemia and Blooms. The focus of my lab is to identify new DNA repair genes, understand how they work in DNA repair in mitotic and meiotic cells and determine how defects in these processes contribute to human disease such as cancer. We hope that our work will provide an improved understanding of how DNA repair works and how, when DNA repair is compromised, it contributes to cancer/ageing and or infertility disorders in humans.\"[12] Boulton's research has resulted in several major breakthroughs in understanding that are viewed as highly promising with regard to the potential development of new cancer treatments.[13]/nDNA is highly reactive and susceptible to damage from things we are exposed to in everyday life.

In addition, he and his team discovered the PBZ motif and determined that ALC1 (Amplified in Liver Cancer 1) is a poly(ADP-ribose)-activated chromatin-remodelling enzyme required for DNA repair, and that poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation (PAR) is a post-translational modification of proteins that play an important role in mediating protein interactions and the recruitment of specific protein targets.[3]/nAlso, he has discovered that the Fanconi Anemia proteins FANCM and FAAP24 are required for checkpoint-kinase signalling (ATR) in response to DNA damage and established that DNA repair defects of Fanconi Anemia cells can be suppressed by blocking non-homologous end joining.[3] He has also demonstrated that a newly identified helicase, RTEL1, plays a crucial role in repairing double-stranded DNA breaks by means of homologous recombination (HR) \u2013 a discovery that has great therapeutic significance and that has already led to the development of treatments, with a drug currently undergoing clinical tests.[25][26]/nThe discoveries made in Boulton's laboratory have led to new therapeutic approaches.

Bigg's work in wildlife photo-identification enabled the longitudinal study of individual killer whales, their travel patterns, and their social relationships in the wild, and revolutionized the study of cetaceans./nBorn Michael Andrew Bigg in London in 1939, his family moved to the west coast of Canada when he was eight years old. In his youth, Bigg enjoyed exploring the British Columbia wilderness. According to his father, newspaper publisher Andy Bigg, Michael's early life experiences ingrained in him an immense love of nature. Bigg attended Cowichan Senior Secondary School in Duncan, British Columbia and then the University of British Columbia, where he studied falcons, water shrews, and harbor seals. His PhD, awarded in 1972, was based on the reproductive ecology of harbor seals.[1]/nIn recent decades, the  public has come to appreciate and be fascinated by killer whales. However, for at least a century before the mid-1960s, killer whales were widely feared as dangerous, savage predators, a reputation based on rumor and speculation. In the waters of the Pacific Northwest, the shooting of killer whales was accepted and even encouraged by local governments and moreover by other governments throughout the world.[2] During the mid-1960s and early 1970s, a change in global opinion saw the development of public & scientific awareness of the species, starting with the first live-capture and display of a killer whale known as Moby Doll that had been harpooned off Saturna Island in 1964.[2]/nBetween 1962 and 1973, at least 47 killer whales from the British Columbia and Washington coasts were captured for display in captivity, and at least 12 more whales died during capture attempts.[3] It was assumed that the killer whale population in these waters numbered in the thousands; however, as a standard wildlife-management practice for \"harvestable\" animals, the Canadian government determined that a census should be done.[2] In 1970, Bigg became head of marine mammal research at the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans Pacific Biological Station in Nanaimo, British Columbia and was given the task of the census./nBigg's first technique was to send 15,000 questionnaires to boaters, lighthouse keepers, fishermen, and others who frequented the British Columbia coast, asking them to record killer whale sightings on one day.[2] No other animal census of this kind had been performed anywhere in the world.[4] The results of the survey taken on Tuesday July 27, 1971, indicated that the number of killer whales in the British Columbia region of the area was at most 350, drastically fewer than had been assumed.[2] Similar surveys in the following two years and subsequent work with photo-identification techniques (described below), substantiated the results./nIn 1976, Bigg submitted his report, indicating that the rate of captures from such a small population was unsustainable and recommending restrictions on the capture of killer whales from Canadian waters. The same year, the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service conducted a killer whale survey in the Washington coast, which also yielded low numbers, and public opinion had begun to turn against whale capture. Since 1976, no killer whales in British Columbia or Washington waters have been taken for captivity, with the exception of Miracle, a young killer whale that had been discovered starving and with bullet wounds.[2] Killer whales for aquarium display continued to be taken from Iceland until 1989, when that country banned further captures. Since that time, killer whale populations at marine parks have been in decline with only a few small-scale captures that have occurred in Argentina, Japan, and Russia./nIn the early 1970s, Bigg and his colleagues discovered that individual killer whales can be identified from a good photograph of the animal's dorsal fin and saddle patch taken when it surfaces. Variations such as nicks, scratches, and tears on the dorsal fin, and the pattern of white or grey in the saddle patch, are sufficient to distinguish killer whales from each other./nAlthough it had been recognized that some animals could be identified from obvious distinctive features such as scars, Bigg and his colleagues discovered that the dorsal fin and saddle patch area of every  killer whale was sufficiently distinctive to allow the individual to be reliably identified at sea using photographic techniques.[5] The technique enabled the local population of killer whales to be counted each year rather than  estimated. It also allowed longitudinal study of individual whales, their travel patterns, and their social relationships in the wild, and revolutionized the study of cetaceans.[2] Just a few years previously, whale research had meant studying captive or dead animals, and the study of living wild whales had been virtually nonexistent.[2]/nFor killer whales, researchers arbitrarily chose the left side of the animal as the one to be used for identification. Bigg's team of killer whale photographers and spotters quickly grew to include hundreds of volunteers from along the coast, a project that was eventually formalized in 1999 as the B.C. Cetacean Sightings Network. In 1975, researchers examining thousands of black-and-white photographs began to assemble a catalog containing a photograph of every killer whale in British Columbia's waters, a catalog that has been continually updated and used to this day.[2]/nIn 1976, federal funding for Michael Bigg's killer whale research ended, and he was reassigned to other projects. It was not until the early 1990s after Bigg had died, that the Department of Fisheries & Oceans again began to provide funding for whale research on the west coast.[2] Still, Bigg continued his research on his own time for 14 years. Marine biologist Graeme Ellis who began working with Bigg in 1974, said that in the times that funding for killer whale research was absent, \"it had become so fascinating we couldn't let it go - for many years it was done with our own money and our own time.\"[6] In their book Guardians of the Whales, Bruce Obee and Graeme Ellis wrote:/n\"While studying seals, sea lions, or other species in the field he disregarded departmental memos ordering him to forget about whales... He traveled the coast on his own time, soliciting help from anyone and everyone with his infectious fervor. He'd think nothing of asking a float plane pilot to land beside a sport fisherman, then persuade the fisherman to run him over to a nearby pod of whales and click pictures for the rest of the day.\"[2]/nDuring this time, Bigg together with friends and associates, assembled what has been described as \"one of the most thorough data sets for any wild mammal... the killer whale was transformed from one of the least known to among the best understood of all cetaceans.\"[5] His records included births, deaths, diet, and social associations. Bigg and his colleagues gathered enough data to produce a complete family tree documenting the maternal-side relationships of every killer whale on the British Columbia and Washington coasts./nOne of the key discoveries of Bigg's team was that there was divergence in sympatric pods of killer whales living near the British Columbia coastline between residents which ate almost exclusively fish, and transients which hunted marine mammals and other warm-blooded prey. The two ecotypes are \"fundamentally different in most aspects of their behaviour, social organization, and ecology. These differences are so profound that the two forms are socially and genetically isolated, despite living in the same waters\u2026Although the ranges overlap\u2026they have never been seen to mix.\"[7] The resident killer whale population of British Columbia and Washington is further divided into two communities, one northern and one southern, that do not interbreed.[2] These discoveries were taken up by Hal Whitehead in his work on cetacean culture./nAnother discovery was that resident killer whales have one of the most stable social structures of any animal species. Pods of killer whales had previously been assumed to consist of a few adult males and a harem of potential female mates.[8] Bigg's team slowly realized that killer whale pods are matrilineal: killer whales travel not with their mates, but with their mothers and maternal relatives. The basis of resident killer whale groupings is the rule that each animal always travels with its mother for as long as she lives.[4][9]/nAlthough his research was based in the eastern North Pacific, Bigg mentored killer whale researchers from around the world, who sought his advice for their own studies.[1]/nAlthough he is best known for his work with killer whales, Bigg spent most of his career studying other marine mammals. He researched northern fur seals in British Columbia and the Pribilof Islands of Alaska. In 1972, Bigg organized a sea otter conservation translocation of Pacific sea otters from Alaska to Vancouver Island,[5] a population that continues to thrive. He also conducted research on Steller sea lions, California sea lions, and harbor seals.[1]/nIn 1984, Mike was diagnosed with leukemia. While ill, he continued to work to complete his final report on killer whales, and was able to see it in print shortly before he died on 18 October 1990. He was 51. Bigg was survived by a son Colin who died in 2009, his wife Silke, a daughter Michelle, two sisters Carol & Pamela, and his parents Andy who died in 2003 and Irene who died in 1993.[5]/nBigg's ashes were scattered in Johnstone Strait. Attendees, and the press, noted that more than thirty killer whales appeared in the waters in time for the ceremony.[1] The Robson Bight Ecological Reserve in Johnstone Strait, which was designated as a killer whale sanctuary in 1982, was renamed the Robson Bight/Michael Bigg Ecological Reserve. The reserve includes one of the few \"rubbing beaches\" in the world, where killer whales gather to rub against smooth underwater pebbles./nA female northern resident killer whale born shortly before Bigg's death in 1990, is unofficially named \"M.B.\" (her official name is G-46).[1] The \"Dr. Michael Bigg Memorial Bursary\" was created at the University of Victoria for students of marine biology.

Cohn at the then Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, beginning his association with Rockefeller University. During a sabbatical year at the California Institute of Technology, Mirsky published a paper with Linus Pauling on the general theory of protein structure, suggesting that the structure of proteins are coiled in a specific configuration that accounts for the function in the body, and that the protein is denatured when that configuration is lost by breaking the hydrogen bonds that stabilize the structure./nOne of Mirsky's more notorious contributions while at the Rockefeller Institute was his attempt to discredit Oswald Avery. Avery had correctly shown that DNA was likely the agent of heredity. However, Mirsky went to great lengths to block Avery's discovery because of doubts that DNA was the sole genetic material. It is said he even urged the Karolinska Institute in Sweden not to award Avery the Nobel Prize.  Eventually Mirsky's efforts were successful. Avery did not win the prize, despite Erwin Chargaff assertion that Avery's work was worth two Nobel Prizes./nMirsky became an official Member of the Rockefeller Institute in 1948, and in 1950 was internationally congratulated for the \"grand discovery\" of DNA constancy, which proved the concept of DNA as the hereditary material. He served as an editor of The Journal of General Physiology in 1951\u20131961./nMirsky was made Professor in 1954 when the Institute became Rockefeller University. He was also elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in the same year.[4] Mirsky was highly involved in university affairs, and in 1959 he initiated a series of lectures for high school students, now named the Alfred E. Mirsky Holiday Lecture on Science in his honour./nIn 1962 Mirsky chose a new lab assistant from a pool of candidates, in choosing a woman, Ellie Donoghue, he set a precedent by making her the first female lab assistant in the Institute's history, the very same position which he first held upon his initial association with Rockefeller Institute. Mirsky proceeded to entrust Ms. Donoghue with assistance in his research and the running of his laboratory, setting an early precedent for the advancement of women in the labs at Rockefeller University./nMirsky was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1964[5] and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1966.[6]/nFollowing retirement from his laboratory in an official capacity in 1964, he served as librarian of the Rockefeller University from 1965 until 1972, all the while being allowed to maintain his laboratory at the university for his personal research.

His work was one of the first molecular studies in the field of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo in short), a discipline that started its revival in the late 1980s and early 1990s. From 1993-1995 he was a Research Fellow at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. Since 1999, he has been Director of the department Evolutionary Biology at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in T\u00fcbingen, Germany and was appointed Adjunct Professor (Honorarprofessor) at the University of T\u00fcbingen in 2002.

He has developed and established the nematode Pristionchus pacificus as a model system for integrative studies in evolutionary biology.[1] Described in 1996 as a new species by Sommer and co-workers, P. pacificus has grown as an important model system, in which laboratory studies that aim for a mechanistic understanding of evolution can be combined with fieldwork.[1][2] The latter allows ecological and population genetic studies to complement the gene-centered and development-centered perspectives of evo-devo.[1][3]/nThe original work of Sommer\u00b4s research focused on the evolution of developmental processes showing that homologous structures can be generated by distinct molecular mechanisms, a phenomenon now known as developmental systems drift.[4][5][6] More recent work incorporates many additional areas of evolutionary biology.[1][2][3][7][8] The nematode P. pacificus is associated with scarab beetles, an observation that provides an ecological framework and represents one of the cornerstones of his current research.[7] Similarly, a population genetic framework for P. pacificus research has been established with the identification and exploration of La R\u00e9union Island in the Indian Ocean, where this nematode shows an extraordinary genetic diversity.[8] P. pacificus work on La R\u00e9union Island is supported by a field station at the local Insectarium in Le Port. The integrative research program on P. pacificus represents a major paradigm shift for studying phenotypic evolution, by simultaneously investigating in one organism, the same patterns and processes from independent evolutionary perspectives./nConsequently, the most recent studies investigate the evolution of novelty, focusing on developmental (phenotypic) plasticity as a facilitator of biological diversity. Specifically, the combination of laboratory studies with fieldwork allows new insight into the molecular mechanisms of developmental plasticity.[9][10]", "10759350": "Erich Traub (27 June 1906 \u2013 18 May 1985) was a German veterinarian, scientist and virologist who specialized in foot-and-mouth disease, Rinderpest and Newcastle disease. Traub was a member of the National Socialist Motor Corps (NSKK), a Nazi motorist corps, from 1938 to 1942. He worked directly for Heinrich Himmler, head of the Schutzstaffel (SS), as the lab chief of the Nazis' leading bio-weapons facility on Riems Island.[1]/nTraub was transported from the Soviet zone of Germany after World War II and taken to the United States in 1949 under the auspices of the United States government program Operation Paperclip, meant to exploit the post-war scientific knowledge in Germany, and deny it to the Soviet Union.[2]/nDuring the 1930s, he studied on a fellowship at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in Princeton, New Jersey mentored by Richard Shope, performing research on vaccines and viruses, including pseudorabies virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCM).[3][4][5] During his stay in the United States, Traub and his wife were listed as members of the German American Bund, a pro-Nazi German-American club thirty miles west of Plum Island in Yaphank, Long Island, from 1934 to 1935.[6]/nTraub worked at the University of Giessen, Germany, from 1938 to 1942.[7] Traub was a member of the Nazi NSKK, a motorist corps, from 1938 to 1942. The NSKK was declared a condemned, not a criminal organization at the Nuremberg trials.[1]/nFrom 1942 to 1948, Traub worked as lab-chief at the Reich Research Institute for Virus Diseases of Animals (German: Reichsforschungsanstalt f\u00fcr Viruskrankheiten der Tiere) on Riems Island (German: Insel Riems), a German animal virus research institute in the Baltic sea, now named the Friedrich Loeffler Institute. The institute was headed by Prof. Dr. Otto Waldmann from 1919 to 1948, while Traub was vice-president.[7]/nThe Institute at Riems Island was a dual use facility during the Second World War where at least some biological warfare experiments were conducted. It had been founded in 1909-10 to study foot-and-mouth disease in animals and by World War II employed about 20 scientists and a staff of 70-120. Hanns-Christoph Nagel, a veterinarian and biological warfare expert for the German Army, conducted experiments there, as did Traub.[7]/nThe institute was administered under the Innenministerium (Ministry of the Interior), which Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler took over in 1943. The chain of command was Himmler, Dr. Leonardo Conti (Reich Health Leader), Kurt Blome, Waldmann, and then Traub. Traub specialized in viral and bacterial diseases. He was assisted by Anna B\u00fcrger, who was later also brought to the United States after the war, to work with the Navy's biological warfare program.[8]/nOn orders from Himmler and Blome, the Deputy Reich Health Leader and head of the German biological warfare program, Traub worked on weaponizing foot-and-mouth disease virus, which has been reported to have been dispersed by aircraft onto cattle and reindeer in Russia.[9] In 1944, Blome sent Traub to pick up a strain of Rinderpest virus in Turkey; upon his return, this strain proved inactive (nonvirulent) and therefore plans for a Rinderpest product were shelved.[1]/nImmediately after the war Traub was trapped in the Soviet zone of Allied occupied Germany. He was forced to work for the Soviets from his lab on Riems Island.[10] In July 1948, the British evacuated Erich Traub from Riems Island as a \"high priority Intelligence target\" since it was now in the Soviet Zone and they feared that Traub was assisting in their biological warfare program. Traub denied this, however, claiming that his only interest was foot-and-mouth disease in animals.[11]/nTraub was brought to the United States in 1949 under the auspices of the United States government program Operation Paperclip, meant to exploit scientific knowledge in Germany, and deny it to the Soviet Union.[2] From 1949 to 1953, he was associated with the Naval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.[7]/nMonths into his Operation Paperclip contract, Traub was asked to meet with US scientists from Fort Detrick, the Army\u2019s biological warfare headquarters, in Frederick, Maryland. As a noted German authority on viruses he was asked to consult on their animal disease program from a Biological Warfare perspective. Traub discussed work done at the Reich Research Institute for Virus Diseases of Animals on Riems Island during World War II for the Nazis, and work done after the war there for the Russians. Traub gave a detailed explanation of the secret operation at the Institute, and his activities there. This information provided the ground work for Fort Detrick's offshore germ warfare animal disease lab on Plum Island.[6]/nHis publicly published research from his time in the United States reports disease research not directly related to weaponization. In 1951, he published a report for the Naval Medical Research Institute on Newcastle Disease virus in chicken and mammalian blood cells.[12] Two years later, he published a paper for the Navy on the mechanisms of immunity in chickens to Newcastle and the possible role of cellular factors.[13] Also in 1953, he published another paper for the Navy with Worth I. Capps on the foot-and-mouth disease virus and methods for rapid adaptation.[14]/nTraub served as an expert on foot-and-mouth disease for the FAO of the UN in Bogota, Colombia, from 1951 to 1952, in Tehran, Iran, from 1963 to 1967, and in Ankara, Turkey, from 1969 to 1971./nAfter working on biological research for the U.S. Navy from 1949 to 1953, Traub returned to Germany and founded a new branch of the Loeffler Institut in T\u00fcbingen, and headed it from 1953 to 1963.[15] In 1960, Traub resigned as T\u00fcbingen\u2019s director due to the scandal related to accusations of financial embezzlement. He continued with limited lab research for three more years, but then ended his career at T\u00fcbingen.[10]/nIn 1964, Traub published a study for the Army Biological labs in Frederick, Maryland on Eastern Equine Encephalomyeltitis (EEE) immunity in white mice and its relationship to Lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM), which had long been a research interest of his.[16]/nHe retired from the West German civil service in 1971. In 1972, on the occasion of the 500th anniversary of Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich Traub received an honorary doctorate degree in Veterinary Medicine for his achievements in basic and applied Virology (basic research on LCM; definition and diagnosis of type strains of FMD and their variants; development of adsorbate vaccines against fowl plague, Teschen disease of swine, and erysipelas of swine)./nOn 18 May 1985, Traub died in his sleep in West Germany. He was seventy-eight years old.[10]/nIn theory, insects of all types, particularly the biting species, can be used as disease vectors in a biological warfare program. Germany, Japan, Britain, Russia and the U.S. all conducted experiments along these lines during the Second World War, and the Japanese used such insect-borne diseases against both soldiers and civilians in China. This was one reason that President Franklin Roosevelt and Secretary of War Henry Stimson ordered the creation of an American biological warfare program in 1942, which was headquartered at Camp Detrick, Maryland. This eventually grew to a very large facility with 245 buildings and a $60 million budget, including an Entomological Weapons Department that mass-produced flies, lice and mosquitoes as disease vectors. Although the British bio-weapon facility at Porton Down concentrated on the production of anthrax bombs, it also conducted experiments on insects as vectors./nAfter the war, the Army's 406th Medical General Laboratory in Japan cooperated with former scientists from Unit 731 in experimenting with many different insect vectors, including lice, flies, mosquitoes, ticks, fleas, spiders and beetles to carry a wide variety of diseases, from cholera to meningitis. At Fort Detrick in the late 1940s, Theodore Rosebury also rated insect vectors very highly, and its entomological division had at least three insect-vectored weapons ready for use by 1950. Some of these were later tested at the Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah, and allegedly used during the Korean War as well.[17]/nTraub visited the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) in New York on at least three occasions in the 1950s. The Plum Island facility, operated by the Department of Agriculture, conducted research on foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) of cattle, one of Traub's areas of expertise.[1] Traub was offered a leading position at Plum Island in 1958 which he officially declined. It has been alleged that the United States performed bioweapons research on Plum Island.[1][18]/nFort Terry on Plum Island was part of the U.S. biological warfare program in 1944-46, working on veterinary testing in connection with the weaponization of brucellosis. After the war, research on biological weapons continued at Pine Bluff in Arkansas and Fort Detrick, Maryland, while officially at least Plum Island was transferred to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.[19] From 1949, Plum Island also conducted work on biological weapons against animals and livestock, such as foot-and-mouth disease, Rinderpest, Newcastle disease, African swine fever and plague and malaria in birds. Traub's research work from the Second World War onward involved at least the first three of these (all dangerous only to non-human animal species).[20]", "55651514": "Hiroki R.

He, James Watson, Rosalind Franklin, and Maurice Wilkins played crucial roles in deciphering the helical structure of the DNA molecule./nCrick and Watson's paper in Nature in 1953 laid the groundwork for understanding DNA structure and functions. Together with Maurice Wilkins, they were jointly awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material\".[5][6]/nCrick was an important theoretical molecular biologist and played a crucial role in research related to revealing the helical structure of DNA. He is widely known for the use of the term \"central dogma\" to summarise the idea that once information is transferred from nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) to proteins, it cannot flow back to nucleic acids. In other words, the final step in the flow of information from nucleic acids to proteins is irreversible.[7]/nDuring the remainder of his career, he held the post of J.W. Kieckhefer Distinguished Research Professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. His later research centered on theoretical neurobiology and attempts to advance the scientific study of human consciousness. He remained in this post until his death; \"he was editing a manuscript on his death bed, a scientist until the bitter end\" according to Christof Koch.[8]/nCrick was the first son of Harry Crick and Annie Elizabeth Crick (n\u00e9e Wilkins). He was born on 8 June 1916[2] and raised in Weston Favell, then a small village near the English town of Northampton, in which Crick's father and uncle ran the family's boot and shoe factory. His grandfather, Walter Drawbridge Crick, an amateur naturalist, wrote a survey of local foraminifera (single-celled protists with shells), corresponded with Charles Darwin,[9] and had two gastropods (snails or slugs) named after him./nAt an early age, Francis was attracted to science and what he could learn about it from books. As a child, he was taken to church by his parents. But by about age 12, he said he did not want to go any more as he preferred a scientific search for answers over religious belief.[10]/nWalter Crick, his uncle, lived in a small house on the south side of Abington Avenue; he had a shed at the bottom of his little garden where he taught Crick to blow glass, do chemical experiments and to make photographic prints. When he was eight or nine he transferred to the most junior form of the Northampton Grammar School, on the Billing Road. This was about 1.25\u00a0mi (2\u00a0km) from his home so he could walk there and back, by Park Avenue South and Abington Park Crescent, but he more often went by bus or, later, by bicycle. The teaching in the higher forms was satisfactory, but not as stimulating. After the age of 14, he was educated at Mill Hill School in London (on a scholarship), where he studied mathematics, physics, and chemistry with his best friend John Shilston. He shared the Walter Knox Prize for Chemistry on Mill Hill School's Foundation Day, Friday, 7 July 1933. He declared that his success was founded on the quality of teaching he received whilst a pupil at Mill Hill./nCrick studied at University College London (UCL), a constituent college of the University of London[11] and earned a Bachelor of Science degree awarded by the University of London in 1937. Crick began a PhD at UCL, but was interrupted by World War II. He later became a PhD student[12] and Honorary Fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge and mainly worked at the Cavendish Laboratory and the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. He was also an Honorary Fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge, and of University College, London./nCrick began a PhD research project on measuring the viscosity of water at high temperatures (which he later described as \"the dullest problem imaginable\"[13]) in the laboratory of physicist Edward Neville da Costa Andrade at University College London, but with the outbreak of World War II (in particular, an incident during the Battle of Britain when a bomb fell through the roof of the laboratory and destroyed his experimental apparatus),[5] Crick was deflected from a possible career in physics. During his second year as a PhD student, however, he was awarded the Carey Foster Research Prize, a great honour.[14] He did postdoctoral work at the Brooklyn Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute,[15] now part of the New York University Tandon School of Engineering./nDuring World War II, he worked for the Admiralty Research Laboratory, from which many notable scientists emerged, including David Bates, Robert Boyd, Thomas Gaskell, George Deacon, John Gunn, Harrie Massey, and Nevill Mott;[16] he worked on the design of magnetic and acoustic mines and was instrumental in designing a new mine that was effective against German minesweepers.[17]/nIn 1947, aged 31, Crick began studying biology and became part of an important migration of physical scientists into biology research. This migration was made possible by the newly won influence of physicists such as Sir John Randall, who had helped win the war with inventions such as radar. Crick had to adjust from the \"elegance and deep simplicity\" of physics to the \"elaborate chemical mechanisms that natural selection had evolved over billions of years.\" He described this transition as, \"almost as if one had to be born again\". According to Crick, the experience of learning physics had taught him something important\u2014hubris\u2014and the conviction that since physics was already a success, great advances should also be possible in other sciences such as biology. Crick felt that this attitude encouraged him to be more daring than typical biologists who tended to concern themselves with the daunting problems of biology and not the past successes of physics[citation needed]./nFor the better part of two years, Crick worked on the physical properties of cytoplasm at Cambridge's Strangeways Research Laboratory, headed by Honor Bridget Fell, with a Medical Research Council studentship, until he joined Max Perutz and John Kendrew at the Cavendish Laboratory. The Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge was under the general direction of Sir Lawrence Bragg, who had won the Nobel Prize in 1915 at the age of 25. Bragg was influential in the effort to beat a leading American chemist, Linus Pauling, to the discovery of DNA's structure (after having been pipped at the post by Pauling's success in determining the alpha helix structure of proteins). At the same time Bragg's Cavendish Laboratory was also effectively competing with King's College London, whose Biophysics department was under the direction of Randall. (Randall had refused Crick's application to work at King's College.) Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins of King's College were personal friends, which influenced subsequent scientific events as much as the close friendship between Crick and James Watson. Crick and Wilkins first met at King's College[citation needed] and not, as erroneously recorded by two authors, at the Admiralty during World War II./nCrick married twice and fathered three children; his brother Anthony (born in 1918) predeceased him in 1966.[18]/nSpouses:/nChildren:/nCrick died of colon cancer on the morning of 28 July 2004[2] at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Thornton Hospital in La Jolla; he was cremated and his ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean. A public memorial was held on 27 September 2004 at the Salk Institute, La Jolla, near San Diego, California; guest speakers included James Watson, Sydney Brenner, Alex Rich, Seymour Benzer, Aaron Klug, Christof Koch, Pat Churchland, Vilayanur Ramachandran, Tomaso Poggio, Leslie Orgel, Terry Sejnowski, his son Michael Crick, and his younger daughter Jacqueline Nichols.[19] A private memorial for family and colleagues was held on 3 August 2004./nCrick's Nobel Prize medal and diploma from the Nobel committee was sold at auction in June 2013 for $2,270,000. It was bought by Jack Wang, the CEO of Chinese medical company Biomobie.[20][21] 20% of the sale price of the medal was donated to the Francis Crick Institute in London.[21]/nCrick was interested in two fundamental unsolved problems of biology: how molecules make the transition from the non-living to the living, and how the brain makes a conscious mind.[22] He realised that his background made him more qualified for research on the first topic and the field of biophysics. It was at this time of Crick's transition from physics to biology that he was influenced by both Linus Pauling and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger.[23] It was clear in theory that covalent bonds in biological molecules could provide the structural stability needed to hold genetic information in cells. It only remained as an exercise of experimental biology to discover exactly which molecule was the genetic molecule.[24][25] In Crick's view, Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, Gregor Mendel's genetics and knowledge of the molecular basis of genetics, when combined, revealed the secret of life.[26] Crick had the very optimistic view that life would very soon be created in a test tube. However, some people (such as fellow researcher and colleague Esther Lederberg) thought that Crick was unduly optimistic.[27]/nIt was clear that some macromolecule such as a protein was likely to be the genetic molecule.[28] However, it was well known that proteins are structural and functional macromolecules, some of which carry out enzymatic reactions of cells.[28] In the 1940s, some evidence had been found pointing to another macromolecule, DNA, the other major component of chromosomes, as a candidate genetic molecule. In the 1944 Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment, Oswald Avery and his collaborators showed that a heritable phenotypic difference could be caused in bacteria by providing them with a particular DNA molecule.[25]/nHowever, other evidence was interpreted as suggesting that DNA was structurally uninteresting and possibly just a molecular scaffold for the apparently more interesting protein molecules.[29] Crick was in the right place, in the right frame of mind, at the right time (1949), to join Max Perutz's project at the University of Cambridge, and he began to work on the X-ray crystallography of proteins.[30] X-ray crystallography theoretically offered the opportunity to reveal the molecular structure of large molecules like proteins and DNA, but there were serious technical problems then preventing X-ray crystallography from being applicable to such large molecules.[30]/nCrick taught himself the mathematical theory of X-ray crystallography.[31] During the period of Crick's study of X-ray diffraction, researchers in the Cambridge lab were attempting to determine the most stable helical conformation of amino acid chains in proteins (the alpha helix). Linus Pauling was the first to identify[32] the 3.6\u00a0amino acids per helix turn ratio of the alpha helix. Crick was witness to the kinds of errors that his co-workers made in their failed attempts to make a correct molecular model of the alpha helix; these turned out to be important lessons that could be applied, in the future, to the helical structure of DNA. For example, he learned[33] the importance of the structural rigidity that double bonds confer on molecular structures which is relevant both to peptide bonds in proteins and the structure of nucleotides in DNA./nIn 1951 and 1952, together with William Cochran and Vladimir Vand, Crick assisted in the development of a mathematical theory of X-ray diffraction by a helical molecule.[34] This theoretical result matched well with X-ray data for proteins that contain sequences of amino acids in the alpha helix conformation.[35] Helical diffraction theory turned out to also be useful for understanding the structure of DNA.[citation needed]/nLate in 1951, Crick started working with James Watson at Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, England. Using \"Photo 51\" (the X-ray diffraction results of Rosalind Franklin and her graduate student Raymond Gosling of King's College London, given to them by Gosling and Franklin's colleague Wilkins), Watson and Crick together developed a model for a helical structure of DNA, which they published in 1953.[36] For this and subsequent work they were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 with Wilkins.[37][38]/nWhen Watson came to Cambridge, Crick was a 35-year-old graduate student (due to his work during WWII) and Watson was only 23, but had already obtained a PhD. They shared an interest in the fundamental problem of learning how genetic information might be stored in molecular form.[39][40] Watson and Crick talked endlessly about DNA and the idea that it might be possible to guess a good molecular model of its structure.[24] A key piece of experimentally-derived information came from X-ray diffraction images that had been obtained by Wilkins, Franklin, and Gosling. In November 1951, Wilkins came to Cambridge and shared his data with Watson and Crick. Alexander Stokes (another expert in helical diffraction theory) and Wilkins (both at King's College) had reached the conclusion that X-ray diffraction data for DNA indicated that the molecule had a helical structure\u2014but Franklin vehemently disputed this conclusion. Stimulated by their discussions with Wilkins and what Watson learned by attending a talk given by Franklin about her work on DNA, Crick and Watson produced and showed off an erroneous first model of DNA. Their hurry to produce a model of DNA structure was driven in part by the knowledge that they were competing against Linus Pauling. Given Pauling's recent success in discovering the Alpha helix, they feared that Pauling might also be the first to determine the structure of DNA.[41]/nMany have speculated about what might have happened had Pauling been able to travel to Britain as planned in May 1952.[42] As it was, his political activities caused his travel to be restricted by the United States government and he did not visit the UK until later, at which point he met none of the DNA researchers in England. At any rate he was preoccupied with proteins at the time, not DNA.[42][43] Watson and Crick were not officially working on DNA. Crick was writing his PhD thesis; Watson also had other work such as trying to obtain crystals of myoglobin for X-ray diffraction experiments. In 1952, Watson performed X-ray diffraction on tobacco mosaic virus and found results indicating that it had helical structure. Having failed once, Watson and Crick were now somewhat reluctant to try again and for a while they were forbidden to make further efforts to find a molecular model of DNA./nOf great importance to the model building effort of Watson and Crick was Rosalind Franklin's understanding of basic chemistry, which indicated that the hydrophilic phosphate-containing backbones of the nucleotide chains of DNA should be positioned so as to interact with water molecules on the outside of the molecule while the hydrophobic bases should be packed into the core. Franklin shared this chemical knowledge with Watson and Crick when she pointed out to them that their first model (from 1951, with the phosphates inside) was obviously wrong./nCrick described what he saw as the failure of Wilkins and Franklin to cooperate and work towards finding a molecular model of DNA as a major reason why he and Watson eventually made a second attempt to do so. They asked for, and received, permission to do so from both William Lawrence Bragg and Wilkins. To construct their model of DNA, Watson and Crick made use of information from unpublished X-ray diffraction images of Franklin's (shown at meetings and freely shared by Wilkins), including preliminary accounts of Franklin's results/photographs of the X-ray images that were included in a written progress report for the King's College laboratory of Sir John Randall from late 1952./nIt is a matter of debate whether Watson and Crick should have had access to Franklin's results without her knowledge or permission, and before she had a chance to formally publish the results of her detailed analysis of her X-ray diffraction data which were included in the progress report. However, Watson and Crick found fault in her steadfast assertion that, according to her data, a helical structure was not the only possible shape for DNA\u2014so they had a dilemma. In an effort to clarify this issue, Max Ferdinand Perutz later published what had been in the progress report,[44] and suggested that nothing was in the report that Franklin herself had not said in her talk (attended by Watson) in late 1951. Further, Perutz explained that the report was to a Medical Research Council (MRC) committee that had been created to \"establish contact between the different groups of people working for the Council\". Randall's and Perutz's laboratories were both funded by the MRC./nIt is also not clear how important Franklin's unpublished results from the progress report actually were for the model-building done by Watson and Crick. After the first crude X-ray diffraction images of DNA were collected in the 1930s, William Astbury had talked about stacks of nucleotides spaced at 3.4 angstr\u00f6m (0.34 nanometre) intervals in DNA. A citation to Astbury's earlier X-ray diffraction work was one of only eight references in Franklin's first paper on DNA.[45] Analysis of Astbury's published DNA results and the better X-ray diffraction images collected by Wilkins and Franklin revealed the helical nature of DNA. It was possible to predict the number of bases stacked within a single turn of the DNA helix (10 per turn; a full turn of the helix is 27 angstr\u00f6ms [2.7\u00a0nm] in the compact A form, 34 angstr\u00f6ms [3.4\u00a0nm] in the wetter B form). Wilkins shared this information about the B form of DNA with Crick and Watson. Crick did not see Franklin's B form X-ray images (Photo 51) until after the DNA double helix model was published.[46]/nOne of the few references cited by Watson and Crick when they published their model of DNA was to a published article that included Sven Furberg's DNA model that had the bases on the inside. Thus, the Watson and Crick model was not the first \"bases in\" model to be proposed. Furberg's results had also provided the correct orientation of the DNA sugars with respect to the bases. During their model building, Crick and Watson learned that an antiparallel orientation of the two nucleotide chain backbones worked best to orient the base pairs in the centre of a double helix. Crick's access to Franklin's progress report of late 1952 is what made Crick confident that DNA was a double helix with antiparallel chains, but there were other chains of reasoning and sources of information that also led to these conclusions.[47]/nAs a result of leaving King's College for Birkbeck College, Franklin was asked by John Randall to give up her work on DNA. When it became clear to Wilkins and the supervisors of Watson and Crick that Franklin was going to the new job, and that Linus Pauling was working on the structure of DNA, they were willing to share Franklin's data with Watson and Crick, in the hope that they could find a good model of DNA before Pauling was able. Franklin's X-ray diffraction data for DNA and her systematic analysis of DNA's structural features were useful to Watson and Crick in guiding them towards a correct molecular model. The key problem for Watson and Crick, which could not be resolved by the data from King's College, was to guess how the nucleotide bases pack into the core of the DNA double helix./nAnother key to finding the correct structure of DNA was the so-called Chargaff ratios, experimentally determined ratios of the nucleotide subunits of DNA: the amount of guanine is equal to cytosine and the amount of adenine is equal to thymine. A visit by Erwin Chargaff to England, in 1952, reinforced the salience of this important fact for Watson and Crick.[citation needed] The significance of these ratios for the structure of DNA were not recognised until Watson, persisting in building structural models, realised that A:T and C:G pairs are structurally similar. In particular, the length of each base pair is the same. Chargaff had also pointed out to Watson that, in the aqueous, saline environment of the cell, the predominant tautomers of the pyrimidine (C and T) bases would be the amine and keto configurations of cytosine and thymine, rather than the imino and enol forms that Crick and Watson had assumed. They consulted Jerry Donohue who confirmed the most likely structures of the nucleotide bases.[48] The base pairs are held together by hydrogen bonds, the same non-covalent interaction that stabilise the protein \u03b1-helix.  The correct structures were essential for the positioning of the hydrogen bonds.  These insights led Watson to deduce the true biological relationships of the A:T and C:G pairs. After the discovery of the hydrogen bonded A:T and C:G pairs, Watson and Crick soon had their anti-parallel, double helical model of DNA, with the hydrogen bonds at the core of the helix providing a way to \"unzip\" the two complementary strands for easy replication: the last key requirement for a likely model of the genetic molecule. As important as Crick's contributions to the discovery of the double helical DNA model were, he stated that without the chance to collaborate with Watson, he would not have found the structure by himself.[49]/nCrick did tentatively attempt to perform some experiments on nucleotide base pairing, but he was more of a theoretical biologist than an experimental biologist. There was another near-discovery of the base pairing rules in early 1952. Crick had started to think about interactions between the bases. He asked John Griffith to try to calculate attractive interactions between the DNA bases from chemical principles and quantum mechanics. Griffith's best guess was that A:T and G:C were attractive pairs. At that time, Crick was not aware of Chargaff's rules and he made little of Griffith's calculations, although it did start him thinking about complementary replication. Identification of the correct base-pairing rules (A-T, G-C) was achieved by Watson \"playing\" with cardboard cut-out models of the nucleotide bases, much in the manner that Linus Pauling had discovered the protein alpha helix a few years earlier. The Watson and Crick discovery of the DNA double helix structure was made possible by their willingness to combine theory, modelling and experimental results (albeit mostly done by others) to achieve their goal./nThe DNA double helix structure proposed by Watson and Crick was based upon \"Watson-Crick\" bonds between the four bases most frequently found in DNA (A, C, T, G) and RNA (A, C, U, G). However, later research showed that triple-stranded, quadruple-stranded and other more complex DNA molecular structures required Hoogsteen base pairing. The entire field of synthetic biology began with work by researchers such as Erik T. Kool, in which bases other than A, C, T and G are used in a synthetic DNA. In addition to synthetic DNA there are also attempts to construct synthetic codons, synthetic endonucleases, synthetic proteins and synthetic zinc fingers. Using synthetic DNA, instead of there being 43 codons, if there are n new bases there could be as many as n3 codons. Research is currently being done to see if codons can be expanded to more than 3 bases. These new codons can code for new amino acids. These synthetic molecules can be used not only in medicine, but in creation of new materials.[50]/nThe discovery was made on 28 February 1953; the first Watson/Crick paper appeared in Nature on 25 April 1953. Sir Lawrence Bragg, the director of the Cavendish Laboratory, where Watson and Crick worked, gave a talk at Guy's Hospital Medical School in London on Thursday 14 May 1953 which resulted in an article by Ritchie Calder in the News Chronicle of London, on Friday 15 May 1953, entitled \"Why You Are You. Nearer Secret of Life.\" The news reached readers of The New York Times the next day; Victor K. McElheny, in researching his biography, \"Watson and DNA: Making a Scientific Revolution\", found a clipping of a six-paragraph New York Times article written from London and dated 16 May 1953 with the headline \"Form of 'Life Unit' in Cell Is Scanned\". The article ran in an early edition and was then pulled to make space for news deemed more important. (The New York Times subsequently ran a longer article on 12 June 1953). The university's undergraduate newspaper Varsity also ran its own short article on the discovery on Saturday 30 May 1953. Bragg's original announcement of the discovery at a Solvay conference on proteins in Belgium on 8 April 1953 went unreported by the British press./nIn a seven-page, handwritten letter[51] to his son at a British boarding school on 19 March 1953 Crick explained his discovery, beginning the letter \"My Dear Michael, Jim Watson and I have probably made a most important discovery\".[52] The letter was put up for auction at Christie's New York on 10 April 2013 with an estimate of $1 to $2\u00a0million, eventually selling for $6,059,750, the largest amount ever paid for a letter at auction.[53]/nSydney Brenner, Jack Dunitz, Dorothy Hodgkin, Leslie Orgel, and Beryl M. Oughton, were some of the first people in April 1953 to see the model of the structure of DNA, constructed by Crick and Watson; at the time they were working at Oxford University's Chemistry Department. All were impressed by the new DNA model, especially Brenner who subsequently worked with Crick at Cambridge in the Cavendish Laboratory and the new Laboratory of Molecular Biology. According to the late Dr. Beryl Oughton, later Rimmer, they all travelled together in two cars once Dorothy Hodgkin announced to them that they were off to Cambridge to see the model of the structure of DNA.[54] Orgel also later worked with Crick at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies./nSoon after Crick's death, there have been allegations about him having used LSD when he came to the idea of the helix structure of the DNA.[55][56] While he almost certainly did use LSD, it is unlikely that he did so as early as 1953.[57]/nIn 1954, at the age of 37, Crick completed his PhD thesis: \"X-Ray Diffraction: Polypeptides and Proteins\" and received his degree. Crick then worked in the laboratory of David Harker at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, where he continued to develop his skills in the analysis of X-ray diffraction data for proteins, working primarily on ribonuclease and the mechanisms of protein synthesis. David Harker, the American X-ray crystallographer, was described as \"the John Wayne of crystallography\" by Vittorio Luzzati, a crystallographer at the Centre for Molecular Genetics in Gif-sur-Yvette near Paris, who had worked with Rosalind Franklin.[citation needed]/nAfter the discovery of the double helix model of DNA, Crick's interests quickly turned to the biological implications of the structure. In 1953, Watson and Crick published another article in Nature which stated: \"it therefore seems likely that the precise sequence of the bases is the code that carries the genetical information\".[58]/nIn 1956, Crick and Watson speculated on the structure of small viruses. They suggested that spherical viruses such as Tomato bushy stunt virus had icosahedral symmetry and were made from 60 identical subunits.[59]/nAfter his short time in New York, Crick returned to Cambridge where he worked until 1976, at which time he moved to California. Crick engaged in several X-ray diffraction collaborations such as one with Alexander Rich on the structure of collagen.[60] However, Crick was quickly drifting away from continued work related to his expertise in the interpretation of X-ray diffraction patterns of proteins./nGeorge Gamow established a group of scientists interested in the role of RNA as an intermediary between DNA as the genetic storage molecule in the nucleus of cells and the synthesis of proteins in the cytoplasm (the RNA Tie Club). It was clear to Crick that there had to be a code by which a short sequence of nucleotides would specify a particular amino acid in a newly synthesised protein. In 1956, Crick wrote an informal paper about the genetic coding problem for the small group of scientists in Gamow's RNA group.[61] In this article, Crick reviewed the evidence supporting the idea that there was a common set of about 20 amino acids used to synthesize proteins. Crick proposed that there was a corresponding set of small \"adaptor molecules\" that would hydrogen bond to short sequences of a nucleic acid, and also link to one of the amino acids. He also explored the many theoretical possibilities by which short nucleic acid sequences might code for the 20 amino acids./nDuring the mid-to-late 1950s Crick was very much intellectually engaged in sorting out the mystery of how proteins are synthesised. By 1958, Crick's thinking had matured and he could list in an orderly way all of the key features of the protein synthesis process:[7]/nThe adaptor molecules were eventually shown to be tRNAs and the catalytic \"ribonucleic-protein complexes\" became known as ribosomes. An important step was the realization by Crick and Brenner on 15 April 1960 during a conversation with Fran\u00e7ois Jacob that messenger RNA was not the same thing as ribosomal RNA.[62]  Later that summer, Brenner, Jacob, and Matthew Meselson conducted an experiment which was the first to prove the existence of messenger RNA.[62]  None of this, however, answered the fundamental theoretical question of the exact nature of the genetic code. In his 1958 article, Crick speculated, as had others, that a triplet of nucleotides could code for an amino acid. Such a code might be \"degenerate\", with 4\u00d74\u00d74=64 possible triplets of the four nucleotide subunits while there were only 20 amino acids. Some amino acids might have multiple triplet codes. Crick also explored other codes in which, for various reasons, only some of the triplets were used, \"magically\" producing just the 20 needed combinations.[63] Experimental results were needed; theory alone could not decide the nature of the code. Crick also used the term \"central dogma\" to summarise an idea that implies that genetic information flow between macromolecules would be essentially one-way:/nSome critics thought that by using the word \"dogma\", Crick was implying that this was a rule that could not be questioned, but all he really meant was that it was a compelling idea without much solid evidence to support it. In his thinking about the biological processes linking DNA genes to proteins, Crick made explicit the distinction between the materials involved, the energy required, and the information flow. Crick was focused on this third component (information) and it became the organising principle of what became known as molecular biology. Crick had by this time become a highly influential theoretical molecular biologist./nProof that the genetic code is a degenerate triplet code finally came from genetics experiments, some of which were performed by Crick.[64] The details of the code came mostly from work by Marshall Nirenberg and others who synthesised synthetic RNA molecules and used them as templates for in vitro protein synthesis.[65] Nirenberg first announced his results to a small audience in Moscow at a 1961 conference. Crick's reaction was to invite Nirenberg to deliver his talk to a larger audience.[66]/nWatson and Crick's use of DNA X-ray diffraction data collected by Franklin and Wilkins has generated an enduring controversy. It arose from the fact that some of Franklin's unpublished data were used without her knowledge or consent by Watson and Crick in their construction of the double helix model of DNA.[38][67] Of the four DNA researchers, only Franklin had a degree in chemistry;[38] Wilkins and Crick had backgrounds in physics, Watson in biology./nPrior to publication of the double helix structure, Watson and Crick had little direct interaction with Franklin herself. They were, however, aware of her work, more aware than she herself realised. Watson was present at a lecture, given in November 1951, where Franklin presented the two forms of the molecule, type A and type B, and discussed the position of the phosphate units on the external part of the molecule. She also specified the amount of water to be found in the molecule in accordance with other parts of it, data that have considerable importance in terms of the stability of the molecule. She was the first to discover and formulate these facts, which in fact constituted the basis for all later attempts to build a model of the molecule.  Before this, both Linus Pauling and Watson and Crick had generated erroneous models with the chains inside and the bases pointing outwards.[68] Her identification of the space group for DNA crystals revealed to Crick that the two DNA strands were antiparallel./nIn January 1953, Watson was shown an X-ray photograph of B-DNA (called photograph 51),[69] by Wilkins.[70][71] Wilkins had been given photograph 51 by Rosalind Franklin's PhD student Raymond Gosling.[70][72] Wilkins and Gosling had worked together in the Medical Research Council's (MRC) Biophysics Unit before director John Randall appointed Franklin to take over both DNA diffraction work and guidance of Gosling's thesis. It appears that Randall did not communicate effectively with them about Franklin's appointment, contributing to confusion and friction between Wilkins and Franklin.[73]/nIn the middle of February 1953, Crick's thesis advisor, Max Perutz, gave Crick a copy of a report written for a Medical Research Council biophysics committee visit to King's in December 1952, containing data from the King's group, including some of Franklin's crystallographic calculations.[74][75][76][77]/nFranklin was unaware that photograph 51 and other information had been shared with Crick and Watson. She wrote a series of three draft manuscripts, two of which included a double helical DNA backbone. Her two A form manuscripts reached Acta Crystallographica in Copenhagen on 6 March 1953,[78] one day before Crick and Watson had completed their model.[79]/nThe X-ray diffraction images collected by Gosling and Franklin provided the best evidence for the helical nature of DNA. Franklin's experimental work thus proved crucial in Watson and Crick's discovery. Her experimental results provided estimates of the water content of DNA crystals, and these results were most consistent with the three sugar-phosphate backbones being on the outside of the molecule.[80] Franklin's X-Ray photograph showed that the backbones had to be on the outside. Although she at first insisted vehemently that her data did not force one to conclude that DNA has a helical structure, in the drafts she submitted in 1953 she argues for a double helical DNA backbone.  Her identification of the space group for DNA crystals revealed to Crick that the DNA strands were antiparallel, which helped Watson and Crick decide to look for DNA models with two antiparallel polynucleotide strands./nIn summary, Watson and Crick had three sources for Franklin's unpublished data: 1) her 1951 seminar, attended by Watson,[81] 2) discussions with Wilkins,[82] who worked in the same laboratory with Franklin, 3) a research progress report that was intended to promote coordination of Medical Research Council-supported laboratories.[83] Watson, Crick, Wilkins and Franklin all worked in MRC laboratories./nCrick and Watson felt that they had benefited from collaborating with Wilkins. They offered him a co-authorship on the article that first described the double helix structure of DNA. Wilkins turned down the offer, a fact that may have led to the terse character of the acknowledgement of experimental work done at King's College in the eventual published paper. Rather than make any of the DNA researchers at King's College co-authors on the Watson and Crick double helix article, the solution that was arrived at was to publish two additional papers from King's College along with the helix paper. Brenda Maddox suggests that because of the importance of her experimental results in Watson and Crick's model building and theoretical analysis, Franklin should have had her name on the original Watson and Crick paper in Nature.[84] Franklin and Gosling submitted their own joint \"second\" paper to Nature at the same time as Wilkins, Stokes, and Wilson submitted theirs (i.e. the \"third\" paper on DNA)./nWatson's portrayal of Franklin in The Double Helix was negative and gave the appearance that she was Wilkins' assistant and was unable to interpret her own DNA data.[85]/nThe X-ray diffraction images collected by Franklin provided the best evidence for the helical nature of DNA. While Franklin's experimental work proved important to Crick and Watson's development of a correct model, she herself could not realise it at the time. When she left King's College, Director Sir John Randall insisted that all DNA work belonged exclusively to King's and ordered Franklin to not even think about it.[86] Franklin subsequently did superb work in J. D. Bernal's Lab at Birkbeck College with the tobacco mosaic virus extending ideas on helical construction.[38]/nCrick was often described as very talkative, with Watson \u2013 in The Double Helix \u2013 implying lack of modesty.[87] His personality combined with his scientific accomplishments produced many opportunities for Crick to stimulate reactions from others, both inside and outside the scientific world, which was the centre of his intellectual and professional life.[88] Crick spoke rapidly, and rather loudly, and had an infectious and reverberating laugh, and a lively sense of humour. One colleague from the Salk Institute described him as \"a brainstorming intellectual powerhouse with a mischievous smile.\u00a0... Francis was never mean-spirited, just incisive. He detected microscopic flaws in logic. In a room full of smart scientists, Francis continually reearned his position as the heavyweight champ.\"[89]/nCrick occasionally expressed his views on eugenics, usually in private letters. For example, Crick advocated a form of positive eugenics in which wealthy parents would be encouraged to have more children.[90] He once remarked, \"In the long run, it is unavoidable that society will begin to worry about the character of the next generation\u00a0... It is not a subject at the moment which we can tackle easily because people have so many religious beliefs and until we have a more uniform view of ourselves I think it would be risky to try and do anything in the way of eugenics\u00a0... I would be astonished if, in the next 100 or 200\u00a0years, society did not come round to the view that they would have to try to improve the next generation in some extent or one way or another.\"/nBiologist Nancy Hopkins says when she was an undergraduate in the 1960s, Crick put his hands on her breasts during a lab visit.[91] She described the incident: \"Before I could rise and shake hands, he had zoomed across the room, stood behind me, put his hands on my breasts and said, 'What are you working on?'\"[92]/nCrick referred to himself as a humanist, which he defined as the belief \"that human problems can and must be faced in terms of human moral and intellectual resources without invoking supernatural authority.\"  He publicly called for humanism to replace religion as a guiding force for humanity, writing:/nThe human dilemma is hardly new.  We find ourselves through no wish of our own on this slowly revolving planet in an obscure corner of a vast universe.  Our questioning intelligence will not let us live in cow-like content with our lot.  We have a deep need to know why we are here.  What is the world made of?  More important, what are we made of?  In the past religion answered these questions, often in considerable detail.  Now we know that almost all these answers are highly likely to be nonsense, having sprung from man's ignorance and his enormous capacity for self-deception\u00a0... The simple fables of the religions of the world have come to seem like tales told to children.  Even understood symbolically they are often perverse, if not rather unpleasant\u00a0... Humanists, then, live in a mysterious, exciting and intellectually expanding world, which, once glimpsed, makes the old worlds of the religions seem fake-cosy and stale[93]/nCrick was especially critical of Christianity:/nI do not respect Christian beliefs.  I think they are ridiculous.  If we could get rid of them we could more easily get down to the serious problem of trying to find out what the world is all about.[94]/nCrick once joked, \"Christianity may be OK between consenting adults in private but should not be taught to young children.\"[95]/nIn his book Of Molecules and Men, Crick expressed his views on the relationship between science and religion.[96] After suggesting that it would become possible for a computer to be programmed so as to have a soul, he wondered: at what point during biological evolution did the first organism have a soul? At what moment does a baby get a soul? Crick stated his view that the idea of a non-material soul that could enter a body and then persist after death is just that, an imagined idea. For Crick, the mind is a product of physical brain activity and the brain had evolved by natural means over millions of years. He felt that it was important that evolution by natural selection be taught in schools and that it was regrettable that English schools had compulsory religious instruction. He also considered that a new scientific world view was rapidly being established, and predicted that once the detailed workings of the brain were eventually revealed, erroneous Christian concepts about the nature of humans and the world would no longer be tenable; traditional conceptions of the \"soul\" would be replaced by a new understanding of the physical basis of mind. He was sceptical of organised religion, referring to himself as a sceptic and an agnostic with \"a strong inclination towards atheism\".[97]/nIn 1960, Crick accepted an honorary fellowship at Churchill College, Cambridge, one factor being that the new college did not have a chapel. Some time later a large donation was made to establish a chapel and the College Council decided to accept it. Crick resigned his fellowship in protest.[98][99]/nIn October 1969, Crick participated in a celebration of the 100th year of the journal Nature in which he attempted to make some predictions about what the next 30\u00a0years would hold for molecular biology. His speculations were later published in Nature.[100] Near the end of the article, Crick briefly mentioned the search for life on other planets, but he held little hope that extraterrestrial life would be found by the year 2000. He also discussed what he described as a possible new direction for research, what he called \"biochemical theology\". Crick wrote \"so many people pray that one finds it hard to believe that they do not get some satisfaction from it\".[100]/nCrick suggested that it might be possible to find chemical changes in the brain that were molecular correlates of the act of prayer. He speculated that there might be a detectable change in the level of some neurotransmitter or neurohormone when people pray. He might have been imagining substances such as dopamine that are released by the brain under certain conditions and produce rewarding sensations. Crick's suggestion that there might someday be a new science of \"biochemical theology\" seems to have been realised under an alternative name: there is now the new field of neurotheology.[101] Crick's view of the relationship between science and religion continued to play a role in his work as he made the transition from molecular biology research into theoretical neuroscience./nCrick asked in 1998 \"and if some of the Bible is manifestly wrong, why should any of the rest of it be accepted automatically?\u00a0... And what would be more important than to find our true place in the universe by removing one by one these unfortunate vestiges of earlier beliefs?\"[102]/nIn 2003 he was one of 22 Nobel laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto.[103]/nCrick was a firm critic of young Earth creationism. In the 1987 United States Supreme Court case Edwards v. Aguillard, Crick joined a group of other Nobel laureates who advised, \"'Creation-science' simply has no place in the public-school science classroom.\"[104] Crick was also an advocate for the establishment of Darwin Day as a British national holiday.[105]/nDuring the 1960s, Crick became concerned with the origins of the genetic code. In 1966, Crick took the place of Leslie Orgel at a meeting where Orgel was to talk about the origin of life. Crick speculated about possible stages by which an initially simple code with a few amino acid types might have evolved into the more complex code used by existing organisms.[106] At that time, proteins were thought to be the only kind of enzyme, and ribozymes had not yet been identified. Many molecular biologists were puzzled by the problem of the origin of a protein replicating system that is as complex as that which exists in organisms currently inhabiting Earth. In the early 1970s, Crick and Orgel further speculated about the possibility that the production of living systems from molecules may have been a very rare event in the universe, but once it had developed it could be spread by intelligent life forms using space travel technology, a process they called \"directed panspermia\".[107] In a retrospective article,[108] Crick and Orgel noted that they had been unduly pessimistic about the chances of abiogenesis on Earth when they had assumed that some kind of self-replicating protein system was the molecular origin of life./nIn 1976, Crick addressed the origin of protein synthesis in a paper with Sydney Brenner, Aaron Klug, and George Pieczenik.[109] In this paper, they speculate that code constraints on nucleotide sequences allow protein synthesis without the need for a ribosome. It, however, requires a five base binding between the mRNA and tRNA with a flip of the anti-codon creating a triplet coding, even though it is a five-base physical interaction. Thomas H. Jukes pointed out that the code constraints on the mRNA sequence required for this translation mechanism is still preserved.[110]/nCrick's period at Cambridge was the pinnacle of his long scientific career, but he left Cambridge in 1977 after 30\u00a0years, having been offered (and having refused) the Mastership of Gonville and Caius. James Watson claimed at a Cambridge conference marking the 50th anniversary of the discovery of the structure of DNA in 2003:/nNow perhaps it's a pretty well kept secret that one of the most uninspiring acts of the University of Cambridge over this past century was to turn down Francis Crick when he applied to be the Professor of Genetics, in 1958. Now there may have been a series of arguments, which led them to reject Francis. It was really saying, don't push us to the frontier.[citation needed]/nThe apparently \"pretty well kept secret\" had already been recorded in Soraya De Chadarevian's Designs For Life: Molecular Biology After World War II, published by Cambridge University Press in 2002. His major contribution to molecular biology in Cambridge is well documented in The History of the University of Cambridge: Volume 4 (1870 to 1990), which was published by CUP in 1992./nAccording to the University of Cambridge's genetics department official website, the electors of the professorship could not reach consensus, prompting the intervention of then University Vice-Chancellor Lord Adrian. Lord Adrian first offered the professorship to a compromise candidate, Guido Pontecorvo, who refused, and is said to have offered it then to Crick, who also refused./nIn 1976, Crick took a sabbatical year at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. Crick had been a nonresident fellow of the Institute since 1960. Crick wrote, \"I felt at home in Southern California.\"[111] After the sabbatical, Crick left Cambridge to continue working at the Salk Institute. He was also an adjunct professor at the University of California, San Diego.[112][113][114] He taught himself neuroanatomy and studied many other areas of neuroscience research. It took him several years to disengage from molecular biology because exciting discoveries continued to be made, including the discovery of alternative splicing and the discovery of restriction enzymes, which helped make possible genetic engineering. Eventually, in the 1980s, Crick was able to devote his full attention to his other interest, consciousness. His autobiographical book, What Mad Pursuit: A Personal View of Scientific Discovery, includes a description of why he left molecular biology and switched to neuroscience./nUpon taking up work in theoretical neuroscience, Crick was struck by several things:/nCrick hoped he might aid progress in neuroscience by promoting constructive interactions between specialists from the many different subdisciplines concerned with consciousness. He also collaborated with neurophilosophers such as Patricia Churchland. In 1983, as a result of their studies of computer models of neural networks, Crick and Mitchison proposed that the function of REM sleep and dreaming is to remove certain modes of interactions in networks of cells in the mammalian cerebral cortex; they called this hypothetical process \"reverse learning\" or \"unlearning\". In the final phase of his career, Crick established a collaboration with Christof Koch that led to publication of a series of articles on consciousness during the period spanning from 1990[115] to 2005. Crick made the strategic decision to focus his theoretical investigation of consciousness on how the brain generates visual awareness within a few hundred milliseconds of viewing a scene. Crick and Koch proposed that consciousness seems so mysterious because it involves very short-term memory processes that are as yet poorly understood. In his book The Astonishing Hypothesis, Crick described how neurobiology had reached a mature enough stage so that consciousness could be the subject of a unified effort to study it at the molecular, cellular and behavioural levels. Crick was sceptical about the value of computational models of mental function that are not based on details about brain structure and function./nCrick was aware that research on consciousness was a difficult task, as he wrote to Martynas Y\u010das in April 1996:/nI don't think we shall fully understand consciousness by the end of this century, but it's possible we can get a glimpse of the answer by then. Whether it will all fall into place, as molecular biology did, without a vital force, or whether we need a radical formulation, only time will tell. Best wishes, Yours, Francis. P.S. By the way, I've not been knighted.[116]/nIn addition to his third share of the 1962 Nobel prize for Physiology or Medicine, he received many awards and honours, including the Royal and Copley medals of the Royal Society (1972 and 1975), and also the Order of Merit (on 27 November 1991); he refused an offer of a CBE in 1963,[117] but was often referred to in error as 'Sir Francis Crick' and even on occasions as 'Lord Crick'. He was elected an EMBO Member in 1964.[3]/nThe award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz, and to Crick, Watson, and Wilkins was satirised in a short sketch in the BBC TV programme That Was The Week That Was with the Nobel Prizes being referred to as 'The Alfred Nobel Peace Pools'./nHe was an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1962),[118] the United States National Academy of Sciences (1969),[119] and the American Philosophical Society (1972).[120]/nThe Francis Crick Medal and Lecture[121] was established in 2003 following an endowment by his former colleague, Sydney Brenner, joint winner of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine.[122] The lecture is delivered annually in any field of biological sciences, with preference given to the areas in which Francis Crick himself worked. Importantly, the lectureship is aimed at younger scientists, ideally under 40, or whose career progression corresponds to this age.

After completing his classical studies in his home town he was sent to Paris in 1801 by his parents to avail himself of the social and literary advantages of the metropolis. A lively interest, however, in geology awakened by the works of Buffon, directed his steps to the museums and the Jardin des Plantes./nHe visited Paris again in 1803 and 1805, and during these periods attended the lectures of Fourcroy, Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de, and Georges Cuvier. His homeward journeys were usually made the occasion of a geological expedition through northern France. As early as 1808 he communicated to the Journal des Mines a paper entitled Essai sur la g\u00e9ologie du Nord de la France. He thus conceived the project of making a series of surveys throughout the whole country. This was furthered by a commission to execute a geological map of the empire which brought with it exemption from military duty./nHe devoted himself energetically to the work and by 1813 had traversed over 15,500 miles in France and portions of Italy. His family had, however, but little sympathy with his geological activity, and persuaded him to give up his expeditions. The map which he had made of France and the neighbouring territories was not published until 1822 and served as a basis for the more detailed surveys of Armand Dufr\u00e9noy and Elie de Beaumont.

In his later years he gave much attention to questions of ethnology and philosophy. His death was hastened by the exertions of a scientific expedition undertaken alone in his ninety-first year. He died in Brussels on 15 January 1875./nHalloy was one of the pioneers of modern geology, and in particular laid the foundation of geological knowledge over wide areas. He made important studies in the Carboniferous districts of Belgium and the Rhine provinces and in the Tertiary deposits of the Paris basin. He was a practicing Catholic during his long and active life, and was characterized by his loyalty and devotion to the Church. He insisted on the harmony between faith and science, making this the subject of his oration on the occasion of the golden jubilee of the Belgian Academy in 1866.

He was, no doubt, impressed by the young man's talents as a proofreader, considerable expertise in technical illustration, and especially by his undeniable enthusiasm for the study of mollusks and substantial knowledge of the subject./nLess than three months after Pilsbry began his new job, George Tryon died and his new assistant, only 25 years old, perhaps to the surprise of some, inherited the titles of \"Conservator of the Conchology Section\" and \"Editor\" of the Manual of Conchology./nPilsbry soon proved capable of prodigious efforts, and his scientific output was remarkable. During the next five years he produced hundreds of detailed pages of the Manual of Conchology, preparing many of the plates himself, and founded The Nautilus, an influential journal of malacology which has survived into the 21st century.[12] He also married during this period, to Adeline Avery. His college, the University of Iowa, honored him with a Doctor of Science degree in 1899 (and he later received two other honorary doctorates: University of Pennsylvania, 1940, and Temple University, 1941). In 1929 he participated in the Pinchot South Sea Expedition. Pilsbry was the first president of the American Malacological Union (Society) founded in 1931.[13]/nFor almost all of the next 57 years of his long life, Henry Pilsbry spent his hours writing scientific papers, over 3,000 of them, mostly while at the Academy of Natural Sciences. Most of his longest papers were published by the Academy. The shorter ones could usually be found in The Nautilus. The large majority of his work carried only his name, although there were sometimes joint or junior authors, some of whom were more patron than scientist. It is notable that Pilsbry did not always confine himself to the several areas of study with which he was already closely associated, but rather would sometimes stray into other fields of science, from geology and paleontology to the taxonomy of brachiopods.[14][15][16]/nHis field work provided a steady supply of new specimens for study, dissection, and illustration, and a seemingly endless array of new species to name. Pilsbry named 5680 organisms;[17] a full list was published in a 218-page volume.[18] Pilsbry performed extensive amounts of field work, and was clearly an expert in dealing with the outdoors, no matter the conditions. He collected mollusks over virtually the entire United States, and in an atlas of countries: Argentina, Australia, Bahamas, Cocos Islands, Cuba, Galapagos Islands, Guatemala, Marquesas Islands, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and other locations as well. His intellectual reach extended even further, through joint efforts with other workers: especially notably Africa with Joseph Bequaert and the Japanese region with Yoichiro Hirase./nPilsbry suffered a heart attack in late 1957 while working at the Philadelphia Academy. He seemed to recover from this serious occurrence, but died at his winter home in Florida, about a month and a half later, from a similar event./nHenry Augustus Pilsbry is buried in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, at St. Asaph's Church./nA species of Cuban dwarf boa, Tropidophis pilsbryi, is named in his honor.[19]/nA species of mollusk, Tethys pilsbyi, was named in his honor by a former student and malacologist, Elizabeth \"Jennie\" Letson.[20]/nPilsbry was an assistant was of George Washington Tryon for two years, from 1887 to 1888. After Tryon's death in 1888, Pilsbry became an editor of an ongoing multi-volume Manual of Conchology.

His articles have dealt with such issues as stem cells, cloning,[3] neuroethics, bioterrorism, and the interface of science and religion. Many of these issues are hotly debated around the world, and specifically in Israel, where religious leaders have a big influence in public policy. Loike has weighed in on these issues in Israeli forums, leading to policy changes there.[citation needed] Serving on a Rabbinical Council of America panel on stem cell research, Loike highlighted scientific innovations that could allow for additional research, while alleviating the ethical questions posed by the scientific use of embryonic stem cells.[4]/nIn 1982, Loike and his longtime study partner, David Hurwitz, published a first-of-its-kind guide to Passover medications. Up until that point, no one had produced a scientific study of leaven ingredients in medications and as a result, many religious Jews had to decide on their own whether their medication could be consumed during Passover according to Jewish Law. Loike and Hurwitz painstakingly contacted various drug manufacturers to ascertain the status of their various medications.

Hendrickson studies the way bacteria like Deinococcus, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus bacteria evolved a spherical shape.[9] All three of these genera lack the gene for the protein MreB (the equivalent of actin in eukaryotes) which controls the width of rod-shaped bacteria. Normally deleting this gene kills the bacterium, but Hendrickson's lab has evolved a rod-like bacterial strain that can withstand the deletion of the MreB gene, enabling them to study how a spherical shape has evolved.[9]/nTo study the process of endosymbiosis, where one single-celled organism captures and incorporates another into its body, Hendrickson and her collaborators ran 10,000-generation experiments with mixtures of amoebae and their bacterial prey, to monitor possible collaborative partnerships that formed and sequence their genomes.[10]/nHendrickson's lab works on discovering and understanding the biology of bacteriophages that attack the bacteria Pseudomonas, Lactocococus, Mycobacterium, and Paenibacillus.[9] In collaboration with the American Foulbrood Management Agency, they are currently investigating phages that kill the bacterium Paenibacillus larvae, which causes American foulbrood (AFB) disease in honey bees.[9] In New Zealand, antibiotics may not be used to control AFB because they leave residues in the honey, so hives are usually destroyed instead.

She attended Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium and knew she wanted to be a medical researcher by the age of 15. She studied chemistry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem before joining the Israel Defense Forces's Atuda academic study program.

In addition, Professor Arnon served as the Director of the institute's MacArthur Center for Molecular Biology of Tropical Diseases from 1958 to 1994.  Much of Arnon's work has been in the development of vaccinations and cancer research.  One of her largest contributions to science was working alongside Professor Michael Sela to develop a drug for multiple sclerosis called Copaxone. The development of Copaxone began with their successful synthesis of the first synthetic antigen. They, along with Devorah Tietelbaum who was at the time a doctoral student, discovered that a material synthetically produced in the lab could suppress a disease found in animals that is a model for multiple sclerosis.

It specifically aids neuroprotection and generation as well as prevents the demyelination of axons, a hallmark of diseases such as multiple sclerosis.  In fact, studies by Arnon et al. have shown an increase in myelination as a result of Cop 1.[5]  In a 2004 article, Arnon and Aharoni state that glatiramer acetate is \"highly effective in the suppression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in various species.\"[6]/nArnon is researching a universal, recombinant influenza vaccination, as well as a cancer vaccine.  A 2009 paper discusses the use of virus-like particles (VLP) to induce an immune response.[7] These particles cannot replicate, but possess the specific antigen-presenting proteins that immune cells use to identify viruses.  Therefore, a vaccine could introduce VLPs to an individual's immune system and bring about the production of memory cells.  Arnon and Ben-Yedidia hypothesize that these vaccines would be effective against H5N1, a pandemic virus more commonly known as bird flu.  They have tested the various synthetic vaccinations on mice and observed a significant immune response.  In addition, they have put human lymphocytes in mice and also observed an immune response.[8]  Their research formed the basis of the company BiondVax, who have taken the universal flu vaccine into human clinical trials./nIn 2017 Arnon was appointed co-chair of the UK-Israel Science Council, alongside Prof. Lord Robert Winston.

His work in basic science has had an impact in the study of cancer, including the realization that eIF4E over expression is prominent in many cancers, and has suggested its utility as a tumor marker. Currently, he has expanded his research into topics such as the roles of translation in neurobiology and synaptic plasticity.[7] Presently, his lab works on translational control in cancer, oncolytic viruses as anti-cancer drugs, microRNA control of translation, and translational control of plasticity, learning and memory.[8] He received the Gairdner Foundation International Award in 2008 for his contributions to medical science.[9] He was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2010.[10]/nIn 2014, Sonenberg was awarded the Wolf Prize in Medicine.[11]", "47721784": "Louise Tsi Chow (Chinese: \u5468\u82b7; pinyin: Zh\u014du Zh\u01d0)[1] is a professor of biochemistry and molecular genetics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and a foreign associate with the National Academy of Sciences, known for her research on the human papillomavirus.[2] Her research contributed to the discovery of gene splicing, and in 1993, her collaborator, Richard J.

Erives also proposed the pacRNA model for the dual origin of the genetic code and universal homochirality.[1] He is known for work at the intersection of genetics, evolution, developmental biology, and gene regulation.[2][3][4][5] He has worked at the California Institute of Technology, University of California, Berkeley, and Dartmouth College, and is an associate professor at the University of Iowa./nErives has shown how genes of the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses inform on intermediate steps in the evolution of the linear, chromatinized eukaryotic chromosome and its mechanisms of gene regulation.[6][7]/nErives' major work is on \u201cregulatory grammars\u201d for transcriptional enhancers  underlying animal development and cancer diseases. Exploiting assemblies for animal genomes, Erives discovered complex gene regulatory codes underlie non-homologous subsets of mechanistically equivalent enhancers.[3][4][8] These codes are composed of a combinatorial \u201clexicon\u201d of transcription factor (TF) binding sites, functional inflections of those binding sites (so-called \u201cspecialized sites\u201d constrained for binding affinity and competition by multiple TFs), and complex site ordering (orientation and positional spacing of those sites). The relationship of these complex regulatory codes within a nucleosomal \"regulatory reading frame\" is a key goal.[9] His lab's work also elucidated how a mutational mechanism (microsatellite repeat slippage) plays a significant evolutionary role in functionally adjusting complex binding site arrangements that recruit poly-glutamine rich factors.[2][5][10] Correspondingly, Erives lab has pioneered the identification of novel poly-glutamine complex recruiting enhancers that integrate developmental signals,[9] while also identifying polyQ allelic series for key developmental factors targeting those enhancers.[11]/nA significant implication of this work is that gene regulatory networks largely evolve by indels in both cis and trans (in enhancer DNAs and polyQ-encoding genes, respectively). As indels are largely produced by unstable microsatellite repeats, which are fast-evolving and difficult to genotype accurately, a large compartment of functional genetic variation is not treated by genome-wide association studies, which focus on single nucleotide polymorphisms and at most a subset of non-repeat associated indels./nErives and colleagues determined how different morphogen gradient responses are encoded in DNA sequence.[2][5] They did so by using diverse Drosophila species that have different sized eggs to study how a set of structured enhancers[4][8] would have co-evolved or co-adapted to changes in the concentration gradients. Morphogen gradient systems are a core fundamental subject of developmental biology. Models of how morphogen gradient responses were encoded had previously been proposed but not tested across a set of unrelated enhancers constructed from a shared regulatory grammar and located throughout a genome./nThree major unexpected findings resulted from this work. The first finding is that gradient responses in general do not evolve by changes in transcription factor (TF) binding site quality or quantity (site density) as expected, but rather by changes in the precise spacing between binding sites for morphogenic TFs and their partner TFs.[2] The second finding is that homotypic site clustering at such enhancers was largely the result of a complex evolutionary history of selection for different threshold responses in the evolving insect egg.[5] A third-related finding is that frequent selection for different responses also enriches for microsatellite repeat tracts, which are inherently unstable and most responsible for the production of novel indel alleles.[5][10]/nErives' work also showed the existence of inherent spatial-temporal conflict in morphogenic responses and how this is handled in nature via complementary morphogenic gradients.[12][13]/nUsing insights gleaned from archaeal genomes, Erives elaborated and described a stereochemical model of \"proto-anti-codon RNAs\" (pacRNAs).[1] The pacRNA model ascribes a predetermined combined origin for the universal genetic code (i.e., the codon table), the biogenic amino acids, and their exclusive homochirality in life. The model implies that early RNA world was  an aminoacylated RNA world and that proteinogenic amino acids arose because of compatible interactions with nucleotide-based polymers. The pacRNA model explicitly lists possible interactions between various anti-codon di-nucleotide and tri-nucleotide sequences and different amino acids. When the nucleotides are D-ribose based, L-amino acids are preferred./nIn the pacRNA world, codons originate as cis-elements for recruiting self-aminoacylated pacRNAs/proto-tRNAs. Thus, a curious aspect of this model is that the (anti-) codon table is determined in evolutionary history prior to the origin of ribosome-based protein translation. The pacRNA model may explain why extant tRNAs are heavily modified in all three domains of life./nErives first presented the pacRNA model at NASAs 2012 Astrobiology Science Conference[14] and most recently at the 2013 Iowa City Darwin Day festival,[15] which focused on the origins of life on Earth./nLike Erives' enhancer studies, which focus on how protein complexes interact with enhancer DNAs, his pacRNA work focuses on how biogenic amino acids would have beneficially interacted with the nucleotide-based molecules of early life. Both areas of study demonstrate how complex patterns in linear molecules emerge from interactions in 3-dimensions./nWith his doctoral advisor Michael Levine, Erives authored several papers on ascidian developmental genetics, with key insights into the evolution of the proto-vertebrate body plan.[16][17][18] This work used the Ciona system to generate copious amounts of embryos that were then electroporated with enhancer DNAs./nIn collaboration with Nori Satoh's lab at the University of Kyoto in Japan, where Erives spent a winter doing research, they also identified the largest collection of notochord specific genes by using genetically altered Ciona over-expressing the Brachyury transcription factor.[19] The notochord is a defining evolutionary innovation of the chordate body plan and this work was designed to advance understanding of the morphogenetic signals emanating from this important developmental and structural tissue./nIn 2001, Erives co-founded the Caltech-associated company CodeGrok (code \"grok\")[20] with Paul Mineiro, currently a Principal Research Software Developer for Microsoft.  It was started in Pasadena, California but later moved to Berkeley, California after its second round of financing. In its first three years, CodeGrok developed and used machine learning methods to identify, classify, and clone transcriptional enhancers from the human genome and construct pathway-specific cell-based reporters for drug screening and other applications.  The company took its name from the Robert Heinlein novel Stranger in a Strange Land and its concept of grok, which is to understand something deeply and intuitively, in reference to the goal of \"grokking\" the regulatory code of the human genome. While the company is no longer in existence, it is often cited as a humorous example of what not to do in naming a start-up company as many people were unable to pronounce the name.[21]", "18787691": "Colleen Marie Cavanaugh is an American academic microbiologist best known for her studies of hydrothermal vent ecosystems.[1] As of 2002, she is the Edward C. Jeffrey Professor of Biology in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University and is affiliated with the Marine Biological Laboratory and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.[2] Cavanaugh was the first to propose that the deep-sea giant tube worm, Riftia pachyptila, obtains its food from bacteria living within its cells, an insight which she had as a graduate student at Harvard.[3] Significantly, she made the connection that these chemoautotrophic bacteria were able to play this role through their use of chemosynthesis, the biological oxidation of inorganic compounds (e.g., hydrogen sulfide) to synthesize organic matter from very simple carbon-containing molecules, thus allowing organisms such as the bacteria (and dependent organisms such as tube worms) to exist in deep ocean without sunlight.[4]/nCavanaugh was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1953.[5]/nCavanaugh received her undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan in 1977, where she initially studied music but ultimately majored in ecology.[6] She says her life changed direction in her sophomore year when she heard about a course in marine ecology at the oceanographic center in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. There, her work involved wading out into chilly waters to study the mating habits of horseshoe crabs, and she described herself as \"[falling] in love\" with the relaxed camaraderie and exchange of ideas between biologists, geologists, and scientists from other disciplines.[3] Cavanaugh took a Marine Ecology course as an undergraduate offered by the University of Michigan, stayed in Woods Hole afterwards (as her car needed repair) looking for a job, and ultimately replaced a \"no show\" in a Boston University undergraduate research program, which returned her to work with local horseshoe crabs./nCavanaugh then moved to Cape Cod to work at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole. During the next two years the focus of her attention shifted from Crustacea to bacteria, \"creatures that impressed her for their ability to live anywhere.\"[3]/nCavanaugh pursued her graduate training in biology at Harvard University, in association with the Museum of Comparative Zoology. She entered Harvard in the fall of 1979, earning an M.A. in 1981 and graduating with her PhD in biology in 1985.[6][7] Her Ph.D. dissertation, entitled Symbiosis of chemoautotrophic bacteria and marine invertebrates, was accepted in 1985.[8]/nBy one account, Cavanaugh was attending a lecture by Meredith L. Jones, curator of worms at the Smithsonian Institution, shortly after she began her graduate studies. Jones was discussing the giant tube worm, a creature lacking both mouth and gut, where the challenge was to understand how it survived. Jones mentioned elemental sulfur crystals within the worms gut; Cavanaugh states that \"It was at that point that I jumped up and said, 'Well, it's perfectly clear! They must have sulphur-oxidising bacteria inside their bodies'\".[6] Jones apparently told her to sit down,[6] but provided Cavanaugh with a specimen captured by a research submarine working on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Cavanaugh eventually substantiated her case./nThe Harvard Gazette describes Cavanaugh's pioneering study of these unique creatures:/nAs a first-year graduate student, she discovered what makes life possible... where the sun never shines, [where] temperatures can exceed 250 degrees F, and [where] the ocean exerts pressures of thousands of pounds on every square inch of an animal's body. Giant worms, huge clams and mussels, and strange shrimp thrive in such conditions because of one-celled bacteria who live on and inside them. The bacteria turn sulfur, methane, and other inedibles into organic molecules that their hosts feed on.[3]/nCavanaugh went on to publish the results of the further work that began to substantiate the discovery, writing from the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard, as first of a five author paper, a short 1981 Science report with Stephen L.

In 1995, she was granted tenure as a full professor \"for [her] discoveries and her reputation as a teacher and mentor.\"[3] Cavanaugh was the Co-director of the Harvard Microbial Sciences Initiative [10] for 17 years.[11][12]/nCavanaugh has continued to build her career on the study of hydrothermal vent ecology. Cavanaugh went on to discover similar symbiotic partnerships among Solemyidae clams living in shallow eelgrass beds and mudflats along the New England coast, and in shrimp near sub-sea springs in the middle of the Atlantic.[3]/nCavanaugh believes that life on Earth may have started under similar conditions and says \"the idea makes sense because some of the oldest forms of free-living bacteria show signs of being heat-loving organisms.\"[3] Cavanaugh's work has made the scientific community rethink the \"warm chicken soup\" theory of life's origins in which the accumulation of organic molecules in shallow waters was a result of lightning electricity./nCavanaugh's discoveries of the biology of the deep Pacific Ocean were made in a Cambridge, Massachusetts (Harvard) laboratory, and she worked on marine life in the laboratory and on board ships for twelve years before securing a place on the deep-diving submarine Alvin; she went to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, off the Florida coast, for the first time in 1992.

Shin returns to work on the Atlantean black box as Mera asks him about Black Manta and what he knows about the Others.[3] When Mera keeps asking Stephen Shin about Black Manta, he states that he hasn't seen Black Manta in years and explains that he met Tom Curry and his son Arthur years ago when Tom saved him from an expedition that went wrong. While he did get the knowledge of Atlantis during that time, Tom refused to have Arthur's abilities revealed to the media as Shin states that it can save his career. Then he tells Mera about a treasure hunter that he found shipwrecked off the coast of Iceland and had fought off a group of pirates. Mera believed that the treasure hunter was Black Manta which Shin confirms. Though he denied that Black Manta had a hand in Tom Curry's death by stating that Tom died of a heart attack and Aquaman later killed Black Manta's father.[6] As Mera still doesn't trust Stephen Shin after he revealed Aquaman to the public, he states that he is not the man that she thinks he is while also explaining that Aquaman attacked Black Manta's ship where it was revealed that the captain was Black Manta's father while Black Manta was the diver at the time when Tom's funeral.[7] When Black Manta arrives to abduct Stephen Shin, Mera fights him until Black Manta stuns Mera and teleports away with Stephen. Black Manta tries to get Stephen to help him at King Atlan's tomb only for Stephen to decline as he does not want to betray Aquaman again.[8] After getting information from the Operative on where Stephen Shin was taken, Mera heads to King Atlan's tomb where Black Manta has the Dead King's Scepter in his hand as he orders his men to kill Stephen only to Aquaman to fight Black Manta's minions. As Ya'Wara believes Stephen to be responsible for Black Manta obtaining the Dead King's Scepter, she starts to attack only for Vostok to stop her saying that Stephen has regretted his actions.[9] Stephen Shin still feels remorse for what happened to Tom Curry only for Aquaman to tell him that what happened to Tom wasn't his fault.[10]/nAs Aquaman faced off against Ocean Master during the \"Throne of Atlantis\" storyline, Cyborg is instructed to protect Stephen Shin.[11] Stephen Shin and Nuidis Vulko watch the news about the war from the computers of the Justice League Watchtower.

From 1981 to 1989 he was working as a project assistant for zoology at the University of Innsbruck. He was habilitated in 1989 with a work on heavy metals in invertebrate animals. Next he used to work as an associate professor at the Institute of Zoology. Dallinger leads the workgroup of ecotoxicology and molecular physiology. In 2011 he was appointed university professor for eco toxicology at the University of Innsburck. He has retired since 1 October 2017./nA major focus of Dallinger's work is dedicated to the biochemical and cell-physiological mechanisms which govern the accumulation of metallic trace elements in invertebrates and fish.[1][2][3][4] By considering both, physiological and ecological aspects,[5][6] his work has contributed to our knowledge and understanding of the importance of invertebrates for the trace element transfer in terrestrial and aquatic habitats and for the application of some key representative species as biological indicators in metal-contaminated environments.[7][8]/nA further topic of Dallinger\u2019s ecotoxicological research has focused on aspects of microevolution and adaptation of species and populations to contaminants (metals, pesticides) in combination with different anthropogenic stressors. It could be shown, for example, that the widespread apple pest species, Cydia pomonella, has split into varied adaptable populations over small-scale areas in the alpine region under the selective pressure of pesticide application. Many of these populations have been able to acquire pesticide resistance.[9][10] Another example of microevolutionary adaptation to environmental pollution has been demonstrated by Dallinger and coworkers in populations of the freshwater sludge worm, Tubifex tubifex. Due to historic and recent metal pollution in European river systems, native populations of this species have split into lineages and cryptic species that differ with respect to their metal resistance.[11]/nA rather molecular and biochemical focus of Dallinger\u2019s work is devoted to the mechanisms of detoxification and regulation of metallic trace elements by metal binding proteins belonging to the superfamily of metallothioneins.[12][13] Dallinger has shown that in certain invertebrate animals (such as, for example, in terrestrial pulmonate snails), metal-selective metallothionein isoforms have evolved that are specifically dedicated to the metabolism of distinct metallic trace elements.[14] The Roman snail (Helix pomatia), for example, possesses a copper-selective isoform involved in homeostatic regulation of copper, whereas a cadmium-specific isoform is responsible for the detoxification of this metal by binding it selectively[15] The genes of these isoforms can be upregulated differentially by metal exposure and non-metallic stressors, thus constituting an impressive example for the adaptive diversification of a gene family towards accomplishing trace element-specific physiological tasks.[16][17][18] Dallinger was also involved in the elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of a metallothionein with three Cadmium-binding domains from the intertidal periwinkle, Littorina littorea.[19][20]/nDallinger\u2019s publications are characterized by a comparative and interdisciplinary approach with an integrative perspective, by addressing issues across different layers of biological organization.[4][11][14]/n1988 Expedition to Lake Tanganyika in cooperation with Christian Sturmbauer (Institute for Zoology, University of Graz).

He has dedicated over three decades to research studying genetically controlled patterns of sleep and wakefulness within Drosophila melanogaster.[2]/nAt Rockefeller University, his lab has made significant contributions in  the field of chronobiology by identifying key genes associated with regulation of the internal clock responsible for circadian rhythms. He was able to elucidate the function of the period gene, which is necessary for the fly to exhibit normal sleep cycles. Young's lab is also attributed with the discovery of the timeless and doubletime genes, which makes proteins that are also necessary for circadian rhythm. He was awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine along with Jeffrey C. Hall and Michael Rosbash \"for their discoveries of molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm\".[3][4]/nMichael W. Young was born in Miami, Florida, on March 28, 1949.[5] His father worked for Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation managing aluminum ingot sales for the south eastern United States. His mother worked for a law firm as a secretary. Despite no history of science or medicine in either of their backgrounds, Young\u2019s parents were supportive of his interest in science and provided the means of scientific exploration through microscopes and telescopes. They lived in an environment close to private zoos, where occasionally some of the animals would escape into their backyard and spark Young's scientific interest.[6]/nMichael Young grew up in and around Miami, Florida.[2] Then, his family moved near Dallas, Texas, where he graduated from L. D. Bell High School.[7] In his early teens, Michael\u2019s parents gifted him one of Darwin\u2019s books on evolution and biological mysteries. The book described biological clocks as the reason why a strange plant he had seen years earlier produced flowers that closed during the day and opened at night. The location and composition of these clocks were unknown, and this sparked Michael Young\u2019s interest at an early age.[6]/nWhile working as a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin, Michael Young met his future wife Laurel Eckhardt. Later, both moved to Stanford University, where Michael worked as a postdoctoral fellow and Laurel pursued her PhD with Len Herzenberg. Today, she is a Professor of Biology at Hunter College. Michael and Laurel still work close to each other. Together, they have two daughters, Natalie and Arissa.[6]/nYoung earned his undergraduate degree in biology from University of Texas at Austin in 1971.[2]  After a summer of research with Burke Judd on the Drosophila genome, Young stayed at the UT to complete a Ph.D. in genetics in 1975.[5] It was during his time here that Young became fascinated with research focused on Drosophila.[6] During his graduate work, he learned of Ron Konopka and Seymour Benzer\u2019s work with Drosophila circadian mutants, which led to his future work in cloning the period gene.[6]/nMichael Young continued his studies through postdoctoral training at Stanford University School of Medicine with an interest in molecular genetics and particular focus on transposable elements.[2] He worked in Dave Hogness\u2019 lab and became familiar with the methods of recombinant DNA.[6] Two years later, he joined Rockefeller University as an assistant professor. From 1978 on he was involved in the University, serving as associate professor in 1984 and later named professor in 1988.[8] In 2004, Young was appointed Vice President for Academic Affairs and was also granted the Richard and Jeanne Fisher Chair.[5]/nAt The Rockefeller University in the early 1980s, Young and his two lab members, Ted Bargiello and Rob Jackson, further investigated the circadian period gene in Drosophila. They constructed segments of recombinant Drosophila DNA, amplified them in bacteria, and injected them in per mutant animals. A locomotor behavior monitor was used to assay behavioral activity. The team watched and recorded fly activity through the day and night to show that the fly restored circadian behavioral rhythms by transferring a functional per gene.[9] Later, by determining the sequence of the gene on the X chromosome, they found that the arrhythmic mutation produced a functionless protein, while long-period and short-period mutants of per changed the amino acid sequence of a still functional protein.[10][11]/nFollowing the discovery of per, the Young lab looked for additional circadian genes. In late 1980s, Amita Sehgal, Jeff Price, Bernice Man helped Young use forward genetics to screen for additional mutations that altered fly rhythms. A new gene located on chromosome 2 was named timeless (tim) and was successfully cloned and sequenced. They found strong functional connections between tim and per. Tim mutants interfered with per mRNA cycling.  In 1994, Leslie Vosshall, a graduate student in Young's lab, discovered that if  PER proteins were protected from degradation, they would accumulate without TIM, but could not move to the nuclei. Later Young and others found that TIM proteins did not accumulate in nuclei in per mutants. They concluded that PER and TIM worked together.[12] Another lab member Lino Saez, saw that PER and TIM associate with each other to stabilize each other and to allow their nuclear accumulation.[13] Later studies by the Young, Sehgal, and Edery labs revealed that light causes the rapid degradation of TIM and resets of the phase of the circadian rhythm.[14][15]/nIn 1998, Jeff Price from the Young lab discovered a kinase called doubletime (Casein kinase 1) that phosphorylates PER on certain serine residues. This signal marks it for degradation. When PER and TIM are bound, doubletime does not seem to be able to phosphorylate PER, allowing it to accumulate.[16]\nYoung\u2019s discovery of doubletime mutants in 1998 was soon followed by the 2001 discovery of a form of Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (FASPS) in humans, which is linked to an hPer2 polymorphism that removes a serine normally phosphorylated by Casein kinase 1.[17] Other forms of FASPS are caused by mutations that alter the Casein kinase 1 gene.  Doubletime mutations in Drosophila alter the phosphorylation and degradation of PER protein.  This affects the regularity in period of the organism.  This discovery solidified doubletime as a necessary part of the circadian clock.[18]", "26291644": "Edward Loranus Rice (1871-1960) was a biologist and educator who served as the acting president of Ohio Wesleyan University.

After working for Radman, Jeggo returned in 1980 to Robin Holliday's lab where she began her research on DNA damage and the cells' response to the damage. After more work in Radman's lab, Jeggo, in 1989, moved to the Cell Mutation Unit at Sussex./nWhen Jeggo reached her thirties, she and her husband started a family giving birth to a son, Matthew. Her husband died from colon cancer shortly after Matthew was born. The death of Matthew's father almost discouraged her from continuing her research in cancer and radiation biology. She returned to her research and further researched cancer and DNA a few years after her husband's death.[3]/nJeggo's primary legacy is her work on DNA damage responses and DNA repair of double strand breaks.[4]  Much of her early work involved Chinese hamster ovary cells, a commonly studied cell line also known as CHO. Using standard techniques of microbial genetics, she tested more than 9,000 colonies before isolating six X-ray-sensitive mutants. This was the first step in understanding the mechanisms involved in the repair of X-irradiation-induced DNA damage.[5]/nJeggo is particularly well known for identifying two components of an enzyme called DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) as being important in DNA non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), a pathway by which mammalian cells repair themselves. This discovery was a major breakthrough in understanding the double strand break repair pathway in mammals. In addition, Jeggo showed that NHEJ is important for the development of the immune response.[4] She also studied LIG4-mutant mice and how exposure to oxygen increases the number of double-stranded breaks due to the failure to repair DNA breaks.[6]/nPenelope Jeggo has participated in various symposiums and conventions where she has discussed her research and given talks on cell biology in relation to radiation biology. In 2001, Jeggo became a founding member of the Genome Damage and Stability Center, a research center established at the University of Sussex.[3] In 2002, Jeggo was a lecturer for the 6th Cancer/Genome Priority Seminar at the Nagasaki University.

Her third award was also for her research in radiation and DNA damage.[15]/nOne of Jeggo's first publication was on her research with double stranded DNA break repair mutants and the effect it has on V(D)J recombination. She and her fellow researchers discovered that two mutants, xrs-6 and XR-1, play a role in restoring V(D)J recombination and were able to identify which genes are affected by DNA breakage.[16]/nIn one publication, Jeggo worked with other researchers on the Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related protein (ATR) and how mutation in ATR can damage DNA which consequently prevents cilia signaling.[17] The team used zebrafish as a model organism in order to test the protein defect and its effects on cilia. Jeggo had researched this subject previously in 2003 when she and fellow scientists concluded that when ATR is exposed to UV radiation, caused a splice mutation in DNA which led to Seckel syndrome, a disorder that retards growth while the fetus develops in the uterus.[18]/nTo continue her research on DNA damage, Jeggo studied aging and stem cells. She found that the inability of DNA Ligase IV to repair breaks in stem cell DNA contributes to the aging of our cells. Jeggo and her team found that breaks in the stem cell DNA come from genetics as well as environmental stress which inhibits the lifespan of stem cells and therefore contributes to aging.[19]/nJeggo began researching epigenetic changes and the effects that epigenetics have on DNA repair. She found that a mutation in ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM) causes damage to DNA and chromatin structure. Jeggo's review showed that nucleosomes are important in DNA repair. However, she claims that more research on the changes in chromatin structure is necessary to further understanding of DNA damage and repair mechanisms.[20]", "7515583": "Charles J.

The family moved to Adelaide, South Australia in November 1916. He attended Rose Park Primary School and Thebarton Technical School. He attended the University of Adelaide, where he earned degrees in medicine and surgery in 1938. That year, uneasy about Hitler's rise, he legally changed his middle name from Johannes (the first name of his German-born paternal grandfather) to John.[6]/nIn May 1937, Fenner was a member of an Adelaide University anthropological expedition to Nepabunna Mission in the northern Flinders Ranges in South Australia led by J.B. Cleland, which also included Charles P.

Here he began studying viruses again, in particular the myxoma virus./nThroughout the 1940s and 1950s Australia had severe rabbit plagues. Fenner's work on the myxoma virus showed that initially it killed rabbits in 9 to 11 days and was 99.5% lethal. Under heavy selection pressure, the few rabbits that survived developed resistance, which meant that the pest was never completely eradicated, but their numbers were reduced. Prior to the release of the virus as a biological control for the rabbits, Fenner, Frank Macfarlane Burnet, and Ian Clunies Ross famously injected themselves with myxoma virus, to prove it was not dangerous for humans./nFrom 1967 to 1973 Fenner was Director of the John Curtin School of Medical Research. In 1977, he was named the chairman of the Global Commission for the Certification of Smallpox Eradication, the same year the last known case of naturally transmitted smallpox occurred in Somalia. Fenner announced the eradication of smallpox to the World Health Assembly on 8 May 1980.[6] This success story is regarded as the greatest achievement of the World Health Organization. Before its eradication, smallpox was one of the world's most virulent viruses, responsible for millions of deaths, and leaving many of the victims who survived with disfiguring scars for life./nFenner had an abiding interest in the environment, and was the foundation Director of the Centre for Resources and Environmental Studies at the ANU (1973), where he worked until his retirement in 1979, and which became part of the Fenner School of Environment and Society in 2007.[10] He was a keen supporter of Australia having an ecologically, socially sustainable population.

Ellen Margaret 'Bobbie' Roberts was a trained midwife and nurse. During World War II she worked on malaria with the Australian Army Nursing Service and through her work met Fenner.[14] Shortly after they met they married in a Catholic ceremony (despite Fenner being an atheist).[15] While keen to have children, the couple were infertile and with Bobbie having a hysterectomy in 1949 they decided to adopt. They subsequently adopted two children. Marilyn Aldus Fenner was born on 27 June 1950. Her biological parents were unknown. Victoria Fenner (born 1 March 1943) was adopted later at the request of her father (Fenner's younger brother Tom) after the death in a fire of Victoria's mother (Beverley Slaney).[16]/nOn 30 March 1958, Victoria Fenner shot and killed herself, as part of a supposed suicide pact with another child, Catherine Webb, who provided the rifle and bullets. The coronial inquiry heard she had been passing through a period of extreme mental and spiritual disturbance and the coroner declared her death a suicide.[17] Fenner himself was unable to fathom a motive, other than she was upset from reading Neville Shute's book, On the Beach.[18]/nBobbie Fenner was diagnosed with cancer in 1989 and eventually died in 1994.

This work was conducted with colleagues Bill H. Hoyer, Brian J. McCarthy, Ellis T. Bolton, Richard B. Roberts, David Kohne, and others.[3][4] This work led him to want to understand the structure of the chromosome, which was little understood at the time. He developed a new method to explore the sequence structure of DNA using the idea of DNA hybridization. Through this work, he showed that eukaryotic genomes have many repetitive, non-coding DNA sequences, known as repeated sequences.[5][6] These are now known to be important in the regulation of gene expression in most cells. Shortly thereafter, a theoretical paper with Eric Davidson laid some of the important groundwork for our modern understanding of the regulation of gene expression.[7]/nBritten then moved to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where he remained for the rest of his career.

He combined empirical research with mathematical models, and supported the declining population paradigm./nCaughley was the middle of three children. He was the only son born to John Norman Caughley and Thelma Caughley. His father would take him on excursions while his mother encouraged his curiosity.[2] As a young child Caughley was very inquisitive and he recalled finding a seashell on top of a hill. At the age of seven he determined that the sea must have once covered the hill and was proud to have resolved the problem.[3] This event encouraged him to learn more about New Zealand's geology and as Gunn and Walker explain \"Ecology had a close call with Graeme Caughley. He almost chose geology at the start of his career...\"[4]/nCaughley attended Victoria University College in Wellington, New Zealand from 1956 to 1959. Tyndale-Biscoe writes that \"there is no record of any particular lecturers influencing his thinking.\"  In his last two years Caughley dropped down to part-time and went to work with his friend Thane Riney at the New Zealand Forest Service on feral goat herds./nCaughley continued his education at the University of Sydney (1960\u20131963) with his advisors Charles Birch (insect population ecologist) and Harry Frith (ornithologist). Frith was chief of the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and Caughley used the CSIRO sheep station to study the ecology of kangaroos.[2] Caughley found that kangaroo groups are formed by a random process of members coming and leaving,[5] which was in contrast to what he had seen in red deer. He interpreted this to mean that random grouping was density dependent with increased grouping at higher densities. An approximation of density could then be found by taking the average number of individuals per group in a given area. Continuing his research he found that red kangaroos are much more drought-tolerant than grey kangaroos, which visit water three times more often.[5] In addition he showed that grey kangaroos prefer areas of higher ground cover than do red kangaroos and that this may be a behavioural relic from when the Tasmanian wolf and Tasmanian devil overlapped in habitat with the kangaroo.[5]/nWhile working for the New Zealand Forest Service, Graeme used his research on the Himalayan tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus)[6] towards his doctoral work. He decided to work on tahr because at that time everyone claimed to be an expert on red deer and he thought that he would make a greater contribution working on the lesser known tahr.[3] Caughley wanted to see if Thane Riney's eruption and stabilisation patterns in deer also applied to tahr.[3] He used his studies at the Forest Service for his PhD thesis at the University of Canterbury (1962\u20131967) advised primarily by Bernard Stonehouse (Antarctic and penguin ecologist). Using three study populations of Himalayan tahr (judged to be in the initial increase, initial stabilisation, and decline stage) Caughley found that tahr follow the pattern that Riney had found in deer.[7][8]/nDuring 1966 Caughley presented methods by which to determine mortality patterns in mammals. He looked at mortality rate curves (qx) among ungulates, rats, voles, sheep, and man he found that they followed a common pattern. This \"u\" shaped pattern had a high juvenile mortality followed by a decrease and then a steady increase in mortality punctuated by a sharp increase with maturity.[9] With this mortality pattern it was shown that although age of mortality differs among species as well as cause of death (disease, lack of food, predation) the trend that mammal species follow is similar.[9] This is important in wildlife management since it shows that regardless of natural mortality factors populations tend to have high juvenile and mature deaths./nWhile working for the Forest Service and attending the University of Canterbury for his PhD, Caughley modified Lotka and Fisher's equations for birth rates in populations to ones that applied to seasonally breeding populations.[10] He wrote that most of the animal world had a season for breeding and that if births were treated as occurring at only one point in time then these equations could be used for seasonally breeding populations.[10] This modification now gave a more accurate estimate of the reproductive value of a population without overestimating births by assuming year around reproduction.[10]/nCaughley and Birch (1971) published \"Rate of Increase\" to point out some of the misuses with this equation. Originally applied mainly to insects and humans[11] they claim that the questions asked by entomologists are not necessarily those asked by mammalogists and vice versa.[11] It is this difference in questions that caused misuse of particular equations in the realm of vertebrate studies. They point out that the rate of increase at a given density for a population of a stable age distribution (rs) is not obtainable when looking at mammals. This is because the assumptions used to make the age distributions (rs=0) when used to estimate rs cause it to be low.[11]/nThe second argument is that the maximum rate at which a population with a stable age distribution increases in a given environment (rm= intrinsic rate of increase) can be calculated with the correct data.[11] It had however, been used incorrectly by mammalogists who thought that vertebrate life table and fecundity data somehow paralleled those of caged insects held at low density. The correction was to infer what the rate of increase for a given population would be at both the initial density and at a higher density.[11] In this way they corrected a misapplication of models so that those managing populations would use the right equation for the question that they were asking./nNot only did Caughley clarify methods so that they would be more applicable to population ecology, but he also condensed material that he thought was useful. In \"Analysis of Vertebrate Populations\" he distilled analyses that he thought were most relevant to the field and chose those that were also easy to understand.[12] R. S. Millar stated in his review that until this book literature on analyses had been scattered and difficult to understand, but Caughley made topics more readable.[13]/nCaughley also co-published a book on Wildlife Ecology, Conservation, and Management:[14] the first portion of the book covers an overview of population ecology while the second part is on applied ecology or management. His last publication Conservation Biology in Theory and Practice[15] gives a history of prehistoric and historic extinctions as well as a collection of case studies. It contains chapters that look at the different ways population dynamics, risks, and legislation are approached. Perez [16] claims that there is such a high volume of conservation textbooks today, but this one is more of a handbook on diagnosing and treating problems with populations. This diagnostic style is in part due to it being written by two field biologists, something that Clinchy and Krebs[17] say took sixteen years in the making. That this is the first time that field biologists have written a book on conservation biology is a breakthrough in conservation biology.[17] Before this, textbooks written by lab ecologists were used to teach field ecologists in a more abstract theoretical way./nCaughley advocated the use of the Declining Population Paradigm in conservation biology.[18] This paradigm seeks to discover why a population is declining and how to prevent further declines. This opposes the small population paradigm that seeks to determine how long a small population will last.[18] The declining population paradigm is not overly theoretical and does not deal with population viability analysis, effective population size, minimum viable populations or problems related to genetics. Caughley pointed out that it did not require a model to go out and observe what was going on in a system (cause and effect), although this lack of a mathematical model hinders generalisations by requiring case by case assessments.[18]/nShortly after Caughley's death, Hedrick and colleagues argued against the declining population paradigm for what they called the inclusive population viability analysis (PVA)[19] At a first reading it is difficult to discern what the counter argument is since they state that they agree with Caughley in that a broader understanding and synthesis of ideas is required.[19] It is upon closer examination, however that the concept and statement that \"one cannot always interpret the significance of deterministic factors unless a proper inclusive PVA is carried out\".[19] This paper was in reaction to Caughley's promotion of common sense and was written by those that encouraged the use of mathematical models. Caughley however, was not against mathematical models and used them to determine rates of increase, dispersal, fecundity, and mortality.[20]/nTo truly understand the controversy one must read the two articles of \"Viva Caughley!\".[17] Both articles were written as a rebuttal to Hedrick and colleagues, who claim that Caughley's ideas are overly simplistic. Clinchy and Krebs explain that in fact it was not simple enough and \"the basic distinction in conservation biology is between field biologists and lab scientists\".[17] It then was a heated debate against those that used expensive modelling programs and those that went out to do the same thing with inexpensive tools purchased at a hardware store such as pvc pipe and bits of string.[17] Upon careful observation there is little disagreement found between what Caughley said and the rebuttal that Hedrick and colleagues gave.[17]/nAs listed by Tyndale-Biscoe[2]/n1960 Caughley Beach at Cape Bird, Ross Island named after Caughley in recognition of his work on Emperor and Adelie penguins/n1970 Queen Elizabeth II Post-Doctoral Fellowship/n1978 Analysis of Vertebrate Populations awarded 'Book of the Year' by the Wildlife Society, Washington, D.C./n1987 Kangaroos: Their Ecology and Management in the Sheep Rangelands of Australia awarded Whitley Book Award Certificate of Commendation by the Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales/n1992 Elected to Fellowship of the Australian Academy of Science/n1993 Awarded CSIRO Chairman's Medal for outstanding research achievements and leadership in the field of vertebrate ecology/n1994 Peter Scott Award for Conservation Merit, Species Survival Commission of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature", "71118316": "Francis Joseph Ryan[1] (February 1, 1916 \u2013 July 14, 1963) was an American zoologist.

Introduced in Detective Comics #400 (June 1970) as an enemy of the superhero Batman,[1] the character belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery. Originally portrayed as a supervillain, later incarnations show the Man-Bat as a sympathetic villain or antihero./nIn the original version of the story, Kirk Langstrom was a zoologist who tried to give humans a bat's acute sonar sense. He managed to develop an extract that could supposedly do this, but upon testing it on himself, he transformed into an anthropomorphic feral half-bat hybrid, lacking sapience and acting purely on instinct. Batman managed to reverse the effects, but Langstrom would return as the Man-Bat time and time again, albeit not necessarily as a villain, as Langstrom would sometimes retain enough sanity to use his powers for good. Several other characters have since appeared as similar Man-Bat creatures, including Langstrom's wife Francine and father Abraham./nSince his debut at the end of the Silver Age of Comic Books, the Man-Bat has been featured in various media adaptations, including television series and video games. In 2017, the Man-Bat was ranked as IGN's 16th-best Batman villain.[2]/nThe character made his first appearance in Detective Comics #400 (June 1970) and was created by Frank Robbins and Neal Adams in collaboration with editor Julius Schwartz.[3] The Man-Bat was the star of his own eponymous series in 1975\u20131976,[4] which proved to be unpopular and was cancelled after only two issues./nDr. Kirk Langstrom, a zoologist who specializes in chiropterology, develops an extract intended to give humans a bat's acute sonar sense and tests the formula on himself.[5] The extract works, but it has a horrible side effect: it transforms him into a monstrous human/bat hybrid creature.[6] This side effect makes him so distraught that it temporarily affects his sanity. He goes on a mad rampage until Batman finds a way to reverse the effects.[7] Later, Langstrom takes the concoction again and the Man-Bat returns. He also coaxes his wife, Francine Langstrom, into drinking the serum and she goes through the same transformation, becoming the She-Bat. Together, they terrorize Gotham City until Batman once again restores them to normal.[8]/nOn some occasions, Langstrom takes the serum and retains enough sanity to work for the forces of good. During one of these periods, he works with the detective Jason Bard. On another occasion, in Action Comics #600, Jimmy Olsen inadvertently puts Superman into a cave occupied by the Man-Bat to protect him from kryptonite radiation that had reached Earth following the explosion of Krypton. The Man-Bat calms the maddened Superman and then summons Hawkman, who helps Superman overcome the radiation. Kirk and Francine have a daughter, Rebecca (\"Becky\"), and a son, Aaron. Because of the effects the serum has on Aaron's DNA, he is born with a deadly illness. Francine turns him into a young Man-Bat to save his life. This occurs in issue #3 of the Man-Bat (vol. 2) miniseries by Chuck Dixon./nThe Man-Bat is sighted in Alexander Luthor Jr.'s Secret Society of Super Villains during the events of the 2005\u20132006 storyline Infinite Crisis.[9]/nIn the aftermath of that storyline, both Kirk and Francine are shown to be alive in the 2006 \"One Year Later\" storyline. Talia al Ghul binds and gags Francine, and then threatens to poison her if Kirk does not give her the Man-Bat formula. After Langstrom gives her the formula, she releases Francine as promised. Talia utilizes the Man-Bat to turn some generic members of the League of Assassins into Man-Bat Commandos.[10]/nIn Gotham Underground, the Man-Bat is apprehended by the Suicide Squad.[11] He is one of the villains seen in Salvation Run.[12] Francine appears in Batman and the Outsiders, serving as the team's technical advisor, and her assistant Salah Miandad operates the \"blank\" OMAC drone known as ReMAC. In issue #10 of that series, Kirk appears, seemingly healthy and also aiding Francine./nIn the 2008 miniseries Final Crisis, the Man-Bat is turned into a Justifier and is shown attacking Switzerland's Checkmate Headquarters.[13] During the 2009 \"Battle for the Cowl\" storyline, following Batman's apparent death, Kirk is haunted by nightmares of becoming the Man-Bat and killing his wife. When Francine disappears, he takes the serum and tries to follow her. After an altercation with the Outsiders, he returns to his human form and is captured by Doctor Phosphorus, who reveals that the serum is not necessary to trigger the change. Kirk discovers that Phosphorus has also captured Francine and becomes the Man-Bat to save her.[14]/nDuring the 2009\u20132010 Blackest Night storyline, Francine tracks down Kirk (as the Man-Bat), having created a cure, and revealed that Kirk's next transformation would be permanent if he did not drink it.[15] Kirk attempts to take the cure, but his Man-Bat persona will not let him. Just as Kirk is about to drink it, Francine is wounded in the crossfire of the battle between Black Lantern Solomon Grundy and Bizarro (the latter of whom is already at the scene, trying to prevent Kirk from taking the cure). Distraught at Francine's injuries, Kirk transforms into the Man-Bat, seemingly permanently.[16] In Batgirl (vol. 3) #10-11, the Man-Bat is seen under the control of the Calculator as a techno-zombie.[17] In the \"Collision\" storyline of Red Robin, following Red Robin's actions against Ra's al Ghul and the League of Assassins, the latter attempts to murder people related to the Bat-Family. The Man-Bat, following Red Robin's orders, protects Julie Madison, a former lover of Bruce Wayne, against Ra's al Ghul's assassins.[18]/nIn The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), the majority of Kirk Langstrom's history is rebooted. The Man-Bat serum first appears in Detective Comics (vol. 2) #18 (May 2013). Ignatius Ogilvy also comes into possession of the Man-Bat serum, which he uses as an airborne virus to spread throughout Gotham City's \"900 Block\".[19]/nIn Detective Comics (vol. 2) #19 (June 2013), Kirk Langstrom first appears where he and his wife Francine are escorted by Batwoman to Batman's location. Langstrom reveals that he is the creator of the serum, intending to help deaf people. Taking responsibility as the creator of the serum, he uses a sample of the serum Batman had obtained to inject himself. This creates an anti-virus which also spreads through the air. Langstrom is turned into a Man-Bat (the last remaining Man-Bat) as his anti-virus cures the remaining citizens of Gotham. It was later revealed that Emperor Penguin was the one who released the virus.[20] Emperor Penguin later made use of Langstrom's Man-Bat serum when he combined it with the Venom drug and one of Poison Ivy's plant concoctions to empower himself.[21]/nLangstrom re-appears in Batman Inc. (vol. 2) #10 (June 2013) apparently giving Batman the serum. He claims to be working on an aerosol antidote to the serum as well.[22] The back-up feature of Detective Comics (vol. 2) #21 (August 2013), focuses on Langstrom and his wife. He changes from the Man-Bat form into his human form and becomes addicted to the Man-Bat serum, taking it every night. He apparently does not remember his actions from the previous night, yet worries that a string of reported killings are his fault.[23]/nDuring the \"Forever Evil\" storyline, the Man-Bat is among the villains recruited by the Crime Syndicate of America to join the Secret Society of Super-Villains.[24] The Scarecrow and the Man-Bat attempt to steal the frozen Talons (assassins that are associated with the Court of Owls) from Blackgate while the Penguin is having a meeting with Bane. Bane arrives at Blackgate as the Man-Bat and his fellow Man-Bats are attempting to transport the Talons to Mr. Freeze and is able to keep one from leaving.[25] The final issues of the series Batman: The Dark Knight would establish that Kirk is the son of a corrupt wealthy pharmaceutical businessman named Abraham Langstrom, who considers his son as a failure when compared to Bruce Wayne, the son of his business rival Thomas Wayne. Abraham would steal his son's serum, make some of his own improvements and use it to target the homeless (because no one would miss them) before being stopped by Batman, though he is able to plead temporary insanity to avoid going to prison.[26]/nIn the Watchmen sequel Doomsday Clock, which is part of DC Rebirth, the Man-Bat is featured on the news as an example of the \"Superman Theory\" where the government has been experimenting on humans to give them superpowers.[27] The Man-Bat later accompanied Black Adam in his attack on the White House.[28]/nIn Harley Quinn Rebirth, Langstrom's wife goes on a rampage against Harley and her friends, turning Harley and her friend Tony into Man-Bats as part of the Penguin's plan to break Harley's spirit. Their other friends get Langstrom released and he helps them find the antidote before predictably escaping himself./nThe Man-Bat later becomes a founding member of the second incarnation of Justice League Dark./nBy taking his bat gland extract, Kirk Langstrom transforms himself into a bat-like creature. When taking an antidote or if the serum wears off, he reverts to human form. As the Man-Bat, his strength, resiliency, speed, and agility are all augmented to inhuman levels. He possesses an extra set of digits in his leathery wings that allows Kirk to fly. With his sonar radar, Kirk can emit high-pitch sound waves and hear those echoes when they bounce off of nearby objects, thus enabling him to navigate perfectly in the darkness. If in the Man-Bat form for long periods of time, he loses control over his bestial side that works purely on instinct, plus making him prone to harm friend or foe alike.[29]/nAs Kirk Langstrom, he is a highly intelligent scientist in the fields of biochemistry and zoology (particularly chiropterology)./nAs mentioned above, Talia al Ghul captured Kirk Langstrom and threatened to poison Francine if he did not give her the Man-Bat formula. Kirk gives in to Talia al Ghul's demands where she uses the Man-Bat formula on some generic members of the League of Assassins to turn them into the group's Man-Bat Commandos.[10]/nDuring the \"Batman R.I.P.\" story line, Talia al Ghul sends the Man-Bat Commandos to destroy Jezebel Jet's airplane.[30]/nIn 2011, The New 52 rebooted the DC Universe. Various Man-Bats have appeared under the control of Talia al Ghul in her plot to destroy Batman.[31] It is later explained that Talia al Ghul had an agent steal the serum from Langstrom's laboratory to use on her soldiers to create the Man-Bat Commandos.[20]/nDuring the \"Forever Evil\" storyline, some Man-Bat Commandos were used to help the Crime Syndicate hunt down the Rogues. The Mirror Master managed to trap some of them in the Mirror World. When a Man-Bat snatches up the Weather Wizard, the other Rogues members chase after it until it crashes into a solid wall of ice upon arriving in Mr. Freeze's territory.[32]/nBack when Thomas and Martha Wayne were still alive, Kirk Langstrom had a father named Abraham whose company, Patriarch Biopharmaceuticals, competed with Wayne Enterprises. Years after the death of Thomas and Martha, Abraham continued his shady deals, which involved exploiting his son's Man-Bat serum which he planned to profit from. He soon became addicted to the upgraded serum. When he became a Man-Bat, Abraham targeted the homeless people of Gotham City, draining them of their blood. This caused Batman to team up with Kirk Langstrom to fight Abraham.[33] Because the skin of Abraham's Man-Bat form was tough, Batman injected himself with the cure and tricked Abraham into drinking his blood enough to transform back to normal. Batman then handed Abraham over to the police. After evading incarceration by claiming that he had no knowledge on what his Man-Bat form did, Abraham returned to his company, though he was wary of the fact that Batman may catch him if he ever makes a mistake.[34]/nIn Countdown to Final Crisis: The Search For Ray Palmer, an alternate version of the Man-Bat is shown. He is from Earth-19 (Gotham by Gaslight), and has experimented with bats similar to his mainstream counterpart. He is later defeated by the Blue Beetle and Batman./nIn the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint event, the Man-Bat is killed by Miranda Shrieve, the granddaughter of Matthew Shrieve.[35] In a flashback, the Man-Bat is invited by Lt. Matthew Shrieve to be a new member of the Creature Commandos and then betrayed. Miranda also kills his entire family.[36] It is revealed that the Man-Bat was working with General Sam Lane, who is responsible for the deaths of Miranda's family.[37]/nIn the Elseworlds story JLA: The Nail, a captured Man-Bat makes an appearance in Professor Hamilton's Cadmus Labs.[38]", "3223076": "Kiril Tsochev Bratanov (Bulgarian: \u041a\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043b \u0426\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0432 \u0411\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432; 5 March 1911 \u2013 16 October 1986) was a prominent Bulgarian biologist and pioneer in the area of immunology of reproduction./nKiril Bratanov was born on March 5, 1911, in the town of Lukovit, Bulgaria as the third son of Tsocho Bratanov Radkinski, a teacher from Yablanitsa.

She completed her studies in 1883, but, at the time, Cambridge University did not grant degrees to women.[4]/nWith the help of her father, Willcox gained a position in the zoology department at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. Her mother, however, regretted the decision since it meant \"giving up all possibilities of marriage\".[6] Very little in the way of zoological course work had been developed at Wellesley to that point, and Willcox had the task of essentially building a zoology department from scratch.  She introduced a number of innovative teaching methods.[2] For a time, her department became one of the foremost in the country, attracting a number of women who would become productive zoologists.[1] Her interest during this period was in ornithology, and in 1895 she published Pocket Guide to the Common Land Birds of New England.[2]/nTo improve her job security at Wellesley, in 1896 Willcox took a leave of absence to study for a Ph.D. at the University of Zurich.[7] In 1898 she was at the Naples Zoological Station.[4] She completed her degree program in 1898 with a dissertation On the Anatomy of Acmaea fragilis (Chemnitz),[7] and was allowed to return to her position at Wellesley as head of the department.[1] Much of her research at the college was on comparative anatomy of molluscs, a phylum of invertebrate animals, and of Acmaeidae, a family of sea snails.[4] She authored a number of scientific papers in zoological publications.[5] Her last paper, published in 1906, was on the anatomy of Acmaea testudinalis.[2]/nWillcox retired in 1910 as professor emeritus, supposedly as a result of poor health.[1] The exact cause is unclear, but a 1928 letter mentioned rheumatism.[2] Following retirement she became active in the League of Women Voters, Federation of Women's Clubs, National Audubon Society, and the Boston Society of Natural History.

There he joined the Weizmann Institute of Science./nLeo Sachs moved to Britain with his family in 1933 following Hitler's rise to power. In 1952 he received a BSc from the University of Wales in Bangor. His original dream was to help establish a kibbutz in Palestine, and he even spent two years as a farm laborer, milking cows. But the doors to Palestine were virtually closed by the British, so Sachs began studying agricultural botany at the University of Wales, became fascinated along the way by genetics and development, and ended up completing a PhD in genetics in 1951 at Cambridge University./nUpon moving to Israel, he began to contribute to the fledgling country in the way he knew best \u2013 as a geneticist at the Weizmann Institute. Because there were no animal studies yet at the Institute, Sachs started working on a theory that human amniotic fluid, which bathes the baby in the womb, contains fetal cells that provide information about the fetus. His research proved him right, showing that these cells can be used to determine the baby's gender and other important genetic properties. Sachs's research formed the basis for amniocentesis, the widely used prenatal diagnosis of human diseases./nEventually, Sachs secured his own laboratory and a supply of mice and began working on a question that would anchor his research throughout: What controls normal development and what happens when development goes wrong? Why does the machinery in cancer cells run amok, causing abnormal proliferation?  Focusing on blood stem cells, a small group of bone marrow cells that produce some 200 billion new blood cells every day, Sachs ended up, in 1963, designing the first cell culture system able to grow, clone, and induce the development of different types of normal blood cells. Using this process, he subsequently discovered and identified a family of proteins that plays a key role in controlling normal blood cell development.

The initial strategy of the IWGSC was to produce physical maps of each individual chromosome and sequence them to get to a reference genome sequence. At that time whole genome sequencing approaches did not yield any high quality sequence assemblies due to the extremely high amount of repetitive sequences in the wheat genome. Feuillet and her team were the first to establish a physical map of chromosome 3B which was published the journal Science in 2008.[6] This paved the way for other teams to complete physical maps of the other 20 chromosomes. In2014, the reference sequence of chromosome 3B was published by Feuillet and her team concomitantly with the publications of a draft sequence of each individual chromosome by the IWGSC, in the journal Science.[18] The reference sequence of chromosome 3B revealed striking patterns of the more than 8,000 genes distribution along the chromosome and a better understanding of the organization, function and evolution of large and polyploid genomes such as wheat. The draft sequence of the 21 chromosomes enabled for the first time the annotation of 124,201 genes and comparative evolutionary analyses with diploid and tetraploid wheat relatives. These sequences anchored to many molecular markers on genetic maps, provided a springboard for faster gene isolation, rapid genetic marker development, and precise breeding through genome editing to accelerate wheat breeding.[19]/nFollowing a breakthrough by NRGene in the capacity to perform assembly of highly repetitive sequences in 2016, the IWGSC combined the physical map-based sequencing and whole genome sequencing approaches to produce a first version of a high quality reference sequence of the bread wheat genome.[20] This was published in 2018 alongside other publications exemplifying the use of such a high quality sequence in Science.[21] Since then, more than  publications referring to the use of the IWGSC reference sequence have been published demonstrating the usefulness of such a sequence, fulfilling the vision that Feuillet and her colleagues at the IWGSC established in 2005.[21]/nSequencing the wheat genome completely is important for producers all over the world. Wheat currently makes up more than 20% of all calories consumed in the world, and as the global population increases, so does the need for wheat.[20] Recently, however, wheat production has been stagnating because technological advances can\u2019t keep up with negative economic and natural factors.[3] The total demand for wheat is expected to increase by 70 percent by the year 2050\u2014an increase of about 1.6 percent per year (Gonzalez). Sequencing the genome has provided an invaluable resource to scientists to accelerate wheat improvement and the capacity for wheat to cope with climate change and be produced in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner through advanced breeding and technology.[20]/nFeuillet leads the science organization at Inari Agriculture as their Chief Scientific Officer. Inari's science organization comprises about 70 employees at their research sites in Ghent, Belgium, Cambridge, Massachusetts and West Lafayette, Indiana. Feuillet and her team work on identifying the regions of the genomes to be edited, and on developing a unique genome editing tool box that enables breeding by editing on major crops such as corn, soybean, wheat and tomato[22] to bring plant breeding to anew age and solve a very complex problem; rapidly creating hundreds of new varieties that will perform optimally in their local environment while requiring minimal natural resources.[23]", "62041680": "Jose V.

In 1978, Lewis had proposed that all these homeotic genes (the ones that tell animals where to put a wing and where to put a leg and so on) arose from a common ancestral gene. So McGinnis carved up the Antennapedia gene and, using those pieces as probes, the trio identified eight genes, which turned out to be the eight homeotic genes in flies. \"That pissed off a lot of people,\" says Levine. \"The homeotic genes were the trophies of the Drosophila genome.

The resulting integrative theories about the brain bridge neurobiology and artificial intelligence./nRajan was born and raised in India. She completed a Bachelors of Technology (B.Tech.) from the Center for Biotechnology at Anna University in Tamil Nadu, India in 2000, majoring in Industrial Biotechnology and graduating with distinction.[3][4]/nIn 2002, Rajan pursued a post-graduate degree in neuroscience at Brandeis University, where she did experimental rotations with Eve Marder and Gina G. Turrigiano, before joining Larry Abbott's laboratory where she completed her master's degree (MA).[3] In 2005 she transferred to the Ph.D. program in Neuroscience at Columbia University when Dr. Abbott moved from Brandeis to Columbia, and began her Ph.D. with Abbott at the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience.[5]/nIn Rajan's graduate work, she used mathematical modelling to address neurobiological questions.[6] The main component of her thesis was the development of a theory for how the brain interprets subtle sensory cues within the context of its internal experiential and motivational state to extract unambiguous representations of the external world.[7] This line of work focused on the mathematical analysis of neural networks containing excitatory and inhibitory types to model neurons and their synaptic connections. Her work showed that increasing the widths of the distributions of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic strengths dramatically changes the eigenvalue distributions.[8] In a biological context, these findings suggest that having a variety of cell types with different distributions of synaptic strength would impact network dynamics and that synaptic strength distributions can be measured to probe the characteristics of network dynamics.[8] Electrophysiology and imaging studies in many brain regions have since validated the predictions of this phase transition hypothesis./nTo do this work, powerful methods from random matrix theory[8] and statistical mechanics[9] were employed. Rajan's early, influential work[10] with Abbott and Haim Sompolinsky integrated physics methodology into mainstream neuroscience research \u2014 initially by creating experimentally verifiable predictions, and today by cementing these tools as an essential component of the data modelling arsenal. Rajan completed her Ph.D. in 2009.[3]/nFrom 2010 to 2018, Rajan worked as a postdoctoral research fellow at Princeton University with theoretical biophysicist William Bialek and neuroscientist David W. Tank.[11] At Princeton, she and her colleagues developed and employed a broad set of tools from physics, engineering, and computer science to build new conceptual frameworks for describing the relationship between cognitive processes and biophysics across many scales of biological organization.[12]/nIn Rajan's postdoctoral work with Bialek, she explored an innovative method for modelling the neural phenomenon of feature selectivity.[13] Feature selectivity is the idea that neurons are tuned to respond to specific and discrete components of the incoming sensory information, and later these individual components are merged to generate an overall perception of the sensory landscape.[13] To understand how the brain might receive complex inputs but detect individual features, Rajan treated the problem like a dimensionality reduction instead of the typical linear model approach.[13] Rajan showed, using quadratic forms as features of a stimulus, that the maximally informative variables can be found without prior assumptions of their characteristics.[13] This approach allows for unbiased estimates of the receptive fields for stimuli.[13]/nRajan then worked with David Tank to show that sequential activation of neurons, a common feature in working memory and decision making, can be demonstrated when starting from neural network models with random connectivity.[14] The process, termed \u201cPartial In-Network Training\u201d, is used as both model and to match real neural data from the posterior parietal cortex during behavior.[14] Rather than feedforward connections, the neural sequences in their model propagate through the network via recurrent synaptic interactions as well as being guided by external inputs.[14] Their modelling highlighted the potential that learning can derive from highly unstructured network architectures.[14] This work uncovered how sensitivity to natural stimuli arises in neurons, how this selectivity influences sensorimotor learning, and how the neural sequences observed in different brain regions arise from minimally plastic, largely disordered circuits \u2013 published in Neuron.[14]/nIn June 2018, Rajan became an assistant professor in the Department of Neuroscience and the Friedman Brain Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. As the Principal Investigator of the Rajan Lab for Brain Research and AI in NY (BRAINY),[15] her work focuses on integrative theories to describe how behavior emerges from the cooperative activity of multi-scale neural processes. To gain insight into fundamental brain processes such as learning, memory, multitasking, or reasoning, Rajan develops theories based on neural network architectures inspired by biology as well as mathematical and computational frameworks that are often used to extract information from neural and behavioral data.[16] These theories use neural network models flexible enough to accommodate various levels of biological detail at the neuronal, synaptic, and circuit levels./nShe uses a cross-disciplinary approach that provides critical insights into how neural circuits learn and execute functions, ranging from working memory to decision making, reasoning, and intuition, putting her in a unique position to advance our understanding of how important acts of cognition work.[17] \u00a0Her models are based on experimental data (e.g., calcium imaging, electrophysiology, and behavior experiments) and on new and existing mathematical and computational frameworks derived from machine learning and statistical physics.[16] Rajan continues to apply recurrent neural network modelling to behavioral and neural data. In collaboration with Karl Deisseroth and his team at Stanford University,[18] such models revealed that circuit interactions within the lateral habenula, a brain structure implicated in aversion, were encoding experience features to guide the behavioral transition from active to passive coping \u2013 work published in Cell.[19][20]/nIn 2019, Rajan was one of twelve investigators to receive funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF)[21] though its participation in the White House's Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative.

He attended the Kreuzschule in Dresden and studied medicine at the University of Leipzig with Ernst Leberecht Wagner from 1866 till 1870, when he received his doctorate in pathology. Afterwards he participated in the Franco-Prussian War, and therein in the Battle of Gravelotte./nAs a ship's physician on the New York Line 1872/73 he examined seasickness \u2013 his works were classified by Prof. Gavingel of Le Havre as the first scientific study on this topic at all. In New York City, Hesse met his later wife Angelina Fanny Eilshemius whose brother Louis Eilshemius is known as an important painter as well. The Eilshemius family were immigrants of Dutch-German origin. Walther and Angelina married 1874 in Geneva, together with Angelina's sister and a nephew of Louis Agassiz./nAfter some years as a medical practitioner in Pirna and Zittau, Hesse went to Schwarzenberg, Saxony in 1877. His investigations in Schneeberger Bergkrankheit, responsible for the commonly early death of miners in the Ore Mountains, are credited as the first unveiling of working conditions as cause of an interior disease (lung cancer). Within his time in Schwarzenberg, he took a year with Max Joseph von Pettenkofer at Munich to deepen his knowledge in occupational hygiene./nHesse joined Robert Koch's laboratory (effectively in a post-doctoral position) in 1881 to study air quality. He was convinced that microorganisms were present everywhere, even in water and in the air. He used a series of filters, made mainly from wadding, in attempts to capture and observe microorganisms. When culturing the organisms he trapped with his filter, he used a gelatin-containing medium capable of solidifying. Frustratingly, the medium had a tendency to melt during the summer months, thus ruining the experiments.  Additionally, many of the organisms he cultured were capable of degrading the gelatin medium, also ruining his experiments./nHesse's wife, Angelina Fannie, noticed that the jams and jellies that she made using agar-agar did not melt in the hot summer weather. She had learned its use from a Dutch neighbor who had lived on the island of Java, in the Dutch East Indies(Indonesia). Hesse found that the mixture of nutrients and agar-agar remained solid up to 140 degrees Fahrenheit, and passed the recipe on to Koch who used it successfully in his work.[1] Further development of agar showed that it would not easily melt (though would remain molten at lower temperatures once it did), was not easily degraded by microorganisms and was a flexible medium.  Koch was soon using the new medium to grow tuberculosis bacteria.[2]/nIn later years, Hesse was district physician in Dresden. He continued his scientific works, experimented with Petri dishes and investigated the microbiological foundations of typhus, cholera and diphtheria. He operated a laboratory at the Technical College Dresden together with Walther Hempel. Hesse introduced pasteurization of milk in Pfund's dairy.

Her work on the bacterial phylum Bacteroidetes and its ecology led to a better understanding of antibiotic resistance and mobile genetic elements. At a time where the prevailing paradigm was focused on E. coli as a model organism, Salyers emphasized the importance of investigating the breadth of microbial diversity. She was one of the first to conceptualize the human body as a microbial ecosystem. Over the course of her 40-year career, she was presented with numerous awards for teaching and research and an honorary degree from ETH Zurich, and served as president of the American Society for Microbiology.[1][2][3][4]/nAbigail Salyers was born in Louisville, Kentucky and attended high school in Arlington, Virginia at Wakefield High School. During high school, she was at risk of expulsion due to being pregnant, but she graduated in 1959 and with the help of her English teacher, Mrs. Baker, applied to college.[1][3][5] Salyers went on to receive her undergraduate degree in Mathematics in 1963 and a Ph.D. in Nuclear Physics in 1969 from George Washington University, Washington, D.C.[1]/nFour years into her first academic position teaching and researching physics at St. Mary's College, Salyers chose to switch her focus to microbiology as a post-doctoral researcher at Virginia Polytech Institute. She began to study the metabolism of the anaerobic microbes of the human intestinal tract, particularly the anaerobic bacterium Bacteroidetes.[1][3][6][4] In 1978, Salyers started her own lab at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. There she met her long-time life partner and fellow professor Jeffrey Gardner, as well as her research associate and collaborator Nadja Shoemaker. In 1983, she became the first woman professor in the Microbiology Department to be granted tenure, and in 1988 was promoted to full professor.[1][2][3] In 2004, she was named the G. William Arends Professor in Molecular and Cellular Biology.[2]/nAs a lecturer at the University of Illinois, Salyers worked tirelessly to revitalize the inaccessible medical school curriculum. In her teaching, she emphasized the importance of microbiology as the defining biological discipline of the coming decades and its relevance to her students. To accompany her work in the classroom, she co-authored the textbook Bacterial Pathogenesis: A Molecular Approach with Dixie Whitt, with whom later collaborations followed. As a result of her educational efforts, Salyers was invited to be Co-Director of the Microbial Diversity Summer Course at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA for the summers of 1995\u20131999.[1][3][5]/nSalyers\u2019 microbiome research was based in the study of the physiology of the anaerobic bacterium Bacteroides, with particular regard to their carbohydrate metabolism and their ability to harbor mobile antibiotic resistance genes. Her lab at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign developed genetic tools that helped to expanded on her earlier research on polysaccharide transport and fermentation in Bacteroidetes. These tools fueled the discovery of the processes though which the bacterium sequesters complex carbohydrates inside the cell and anaerobically degrades them. In the human colon, these metabolic processes result in important byproducts which are utilized by other gut microflora and by the human host. In developing these genetic tools, Salyers\u2019 lab discovered conjugative transposons, a type of mobile genetic element which can transfer genes for antibiotic resistance among gut bacteria. Initially, they used transposons as markers for genetic analysis. But Salyers also realized that transposons could carry antibiotic resistance genes between microbial cells in the human gut. They investigated the tightly regulated molecular mechanisms of the horizontal transfer of these mobile antibiotic resistance genes and discovered that Bacteroides acted as a reservoir of these genes in the human colon. The many tools that Salyers developed to work with her \u201cfunny bugs\u201d and the discoveries she made are responsible for the prominence of Bacteroidetes as a model organism in microbiology today.[3][7]/nIn 2001, Salyers was named President of the 40,000 member American Society for Microbiology. Her tenure overlapped with the 2001 anthrax attacks when she advised the US Postal service about the safety precautions. She learned that providing basic information to the postal workers about the bacterium made it possible to have discussions about sophisticated topics in microbiology in a simple way, and that having that information made them feel less frightened.[1][5] In 2005, Salyers co-signed an open letter to the director of the NIH that asked the NIH to continue to fund research that had the capacity to broadly improve public health, instead of narrowly focusing on biodefense funding.[5][8] She was also one of the first to recognize the public health risks of antibiotic resistant bacteria, and to convey the growing issue to the public. This included co-authoring Revenge of the Microbes: How Bacterial Resistance is Undermining the Antibiotic Miracle (again with Dixie Whitt), which summarized the latest information on bacterial pathogenesis and antibiotic resistance for a broad audience.[1] Salyers was also president of the board for El Centro, a center that provided help for local Latino migrant workers in Illinois.[4] She published over 220 scientific articles.[3] Salyer has also provided her expert testimony regarding genetically modified plants and antibiotic use in agriculture to several regulatory agencies in the U.S. and Europe.[9]/nIn 2014 after her death, the Salyers Symposium was held at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to commemorate her life and work.

From 1963 he was a resident fellow of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, until his death in 1974 in East Hampton, New York, just a year after the airing of his Ascent of Man./nJacob Bronowski was born to a Polish-Jewish family in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Congress Poland, in 1908. His family moved to Germany during the First World War, and to Britain in 1920, Bronowski's parents having been married in Britain in the London house of his maternal grandfather in 1907. Although, according to Bronowski, he knew only two English words on arriving in Britain,[3] he gained admission to the Central Foundation Boys' School in London and went on to study mathematics at the University of Cambridge, graduating as Senior Wrangler (best student mathematician) in 1930.[4]/nAs a mathematics student at Jesus College, Cambridge, Bronowski co-edited \u2013 with William Empson \u2013 the literary periodical Experiment, which first appeared in 1928. Bronowski would pursue this sort of dual activity, in both the mathematical and literary worlds, throughout his professional life. He was also a strong chess player, earning a half-blue while at Cambridge and composing numerous chess problems for the British Chess Magazine between 1926 and 1970.[5] He received a PhD in mathematics at Cambridge in 1935, writing a dissertation in algebraic geometry. For a time in the 1930s he lived near Laura Riding and Robert Graves in Majorca. From 1934 to 1942, he taught mathematics at the University College of Hull. Beginning in this period, the British secret service MI5 placed him under surveillance, believing he was a security risk[why?], which may have restricted his access to senior posts in the UK.[6]/nDuring the Second World War, Bronowski worked in operations research for the UK's Ministry of Home Security, where he developed mathematical approaches to bombing strategy for RAF Bomber Command./nAt the end of the war, Bronowski was part of a British team of scientists and civil engineers who visited Japan to document the effects of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki for the purpose of studying the effects of the atomic bomb and its implications for future UK civil defence. Bronowski, in conjunction with Professor W. N. Thomas of Cardiff University,[7] subsequently produced the secret Report of the British Mission to Japan: the Effects of the Atomic Bombs Dropped at Hiroshima and Nagasaki,[8] which was passed to various government departments and consulted in the design of future UK public buildings. It was simultaneously published in the US./nHis Cambridge College from 1927-33, Jesus, in their webpage: mention his first book of literary criticism, 1939,[9] published by the University Press. And his 1944 study of the poet and artist William Blake, written in his spare time while he was working in government research posts in London and Washington.[10][11]/nFollowing his experiences of the after-effects of the Nagasaki and Hiroshima bombings, he discontinued his work for British military research and turned to biology, as did his friend Leo Szilard, and many other physicists of that time, to better understand the nature of violence. Subsequently, Bronowski became Director of Research for the National Coal Board in the UK, and an associate director of the Salk Institute from 1964./nIn 1950, Bronowski was given the Taung Child's fossilised skull and asked to try, using his statistical skills, to combine a measure of the size of the skull's teeth with their shape in order to discriminate them from the teeth of apes.[12] Work on this turned his interests towards the biology of humanity's intellectual products./nIn 1967 Bronowski delivered the six Silliman Memorial Lectures at Yale University and chose as his subject the role of imagination and symbolic language in the progress of scientific knowledge. Transcripts of the lectures were published posthumously in 1978 as The Origins of Knowledge and Imagination and remain in print. He first became familiar to the British public through appearances on the BBC television version of The Brains Trust in the late 1950s./nBronowski is best remembered for this 13-part series about the history of human life and scientific endeavour. This project was commissioned by David Attenborough, then Head of BBC2, and was intended to complement two preceding series: art historian Kenneth Clark's \"personal view\" series Civilisation (1969), which had covered cultural history, and Alistair Cooke's series America: A Personal History of the United States (first broadcast in 1972)./nDescribed as: \"Many who saw it still remember it as a landmark in television.\" and: \"Lavishly produced and visually stunning, it impressed viewers with its lucidity and with the power of the presenter\u2019s personality.\"[13]/nIn a moving and personal scene filmed at Auschwitz concentration camp, where many Polish members of his family died during the Holocaust, Bronowski startles the viewer when he unexpectedly walks forward 8 inches deep into the muddy waters where the ashes of his family were thrown, in his smart-suit and shoes. And picks up handfuls of watery mud. Whilst saying:/n\"It is said that science will dehumanize people and turn them into numbers.  But THIS was where people were turned into numbers. Into this pond were flushed the ashes of some million people. It was not done by gas. It was done by arrogance. It was done by dogma.  It was done by ignorance. When people believe that they have absolute knowledge, with no test in reality, this is how they behave. This is what men do when they aspire to the knowledge of gods.\"[14]/nFollowing the making of The Ascent of Man, Bronowski was interviewed on the chat show Parkinson. Host Michael Parkinson later recounted that Bronowski's description of his visit to Auschwitz,was one of the most memorable parts of any interview he had done.[15] After he had completed the last episode of his show, Parkinson stated: \"If I could save one interview from the thousands I have done, it would be the one-man show with Professor Jacob Bronowski.\"[16]/nBronowski married Rita Coblentz in 1941.[17] The couple had four daughters, the eldest being the academic Lisa Jardine and another being the filmmaker Judith Bronowski./nHe spent time interviewing the physicist Leo Szilard for about the last year of the scientist's life. Szilard, who died in mid-1964, had authored the 1939 letter to Franklin D. Roosevelt arguing in favour of pursuing nuclear weapons to ensure victory over the Nazis.[18]/nBronowski died in 1974 of a heart attack in East Hampton, New York,[19] a year after The Ascent of Man was first televised, and his ashes were buried in the western side of London's Highgate Cemetery, near the entrance. Rita died in California in September 2010, aged 92.[17] The ashes of Lisa Jardine, who died in 2015,[20] were buried on 25 October 2016 next to her father's in Highgate Cemetery./nBronowski's philosophy of life is best summed up in his own words:-/n\"I see now that the problem of man's status between the world and himself has haunted me since the difficult days of boyhood. All that I have written, though it has seemed to me so different from year to year, turns to the same centre: the uniqueness of man that grows out of his struggle (and his gift) to understand both nature and himself.\"[21]/nIn 2011, on the reissue of The Ascent of Man with a foreword by Richard Dawkins\u2013  in The Guardian Tim Radford describes it \"as compelling as ever\".[22]/nIn 2012 Bronowski's links to the City of Hull were honoured with a Blue plaque.[23]/nIn 2013 Cambridge University Press published online a critique: Jacob Bronowski: a humanist intellectual for an atomic age, 1946\u20131956: by Ralph Desmarais, Historian of Science,[24] writing: \"Witnessing Hiroshima helped transform him from pure mathematician\u2013poet to scientific administrator..  to fame on the BBC airwaves..  from literary intellectual who promoted the superior truthfulness of poetry and poets to scientific humanist insisting that science and scientists were the standard-bearers of truth\", but \"discussing atomic energy.. Bronowski not only downplayed the bomb's significance but was deliberately vague regarding Britain's atomic weapon development programme\"./nIn 2015 the British Science Association launched a new annual Award Lecture \u2013 The Jacob Bronowski Award Lecture \u2013 at the British Science Festival in September; launched in partnership with the Victoria and Albert Museum, to celebrate cutting-edge work at the interface between the arts and sciences./nIn 2019 Timothy Sandefur's biography \"The Ascent of Jacob Bronowski: The Life and Ideas of a Popular Science Icon\"[25] he describes him as more than a polymath, and that he \u201cwas involved with nearly every major intellectual undertaking of the twentieth century\u201d; that he was a \u201cserious philosopher\u201d who made \u201cprobably the finest documentary film ever made\u201d.[13]/nThe biography was reviewed in Nature (journal) by  David Edgerton, who writes of Bronowski's BBC documentary: \"Lavishly produced and visually stunning, it impressed viewers with its lucidity and with the power of the presenter\u2019s personality. Many who saw it still remember it as a landmark in television.\"  But is critical overall of Bronowski: \"His analysis of the relationship between science, the military and power was persistently disingenuous.\"[13]/nIn October 2023 an article in Varsity_(Cambridge) magazine wrote of Bronowski's TV documentary: \"His passion guided his eloquence as if hoping to make the viewer just as interested as he was. Neither was his tone patronising or overly simplified. Quoting Niels Bohr, he said: \u201cEvery sentence that I utter should be regarded by you not as an assertion, but as a question\u201d\". And closes: \"It is only fitting to end with Bronowski\u2019s own eloquent words: \u201cScience is a very human form of knowledge. We are always at the brink of the known, we always feel forward for what is to be hoped. Every judgment in science stands on the edge of error and is personal.

He is best known for his early research (1880\u201383) into the life cycle of the sheep liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica), a discovery he shared with the German zoologist Rudolf Leuckart, his report on the eruption of Tarawera (1888) and his contribution to the development of New Zealand pedagogy.[1]/nThomas was born in Birkenhead, Cheshire, on 3 June 1857, the sixth child and second son of Edith Withiell Phillips (1826\u20131909) and her husband John Withiell Thomas (1823\u20131909), an accountant and, later, senior partner in the Manchester practice Thomas, Wade, Guthrie & Co.[2] Both his parents came from Redruth in Cornwall. His elder brother Ernest Chester Thomas, (1850\u20131892),[3] a Gray's Inn barrister by profession, obtained early recognition as Librarian of the Oxford Union (1874) and, subsequently, for his work as secretary of the Library Association of the United Kingdom (1878\u20131890) and for his 1888 edition of The philobiblon of Richard de Bury. Two of his elder sisters, Clara Irene Thomas (1852\u20131919) and Lilias Landon Thomas (1854\u20131929), actively promoted secondary education for women, notably as foundation headmistresses respectively of Sydenham High School (1887) and Edgbaston Church of England College for Girls (1886)./nIn 1861, Thomas' family moved to Manchester where he was educated privately before being sent as a boarder to Ockbrook School in Derby. He subsequently followed his brother to Manchester Grammar School. Inclined to scientific studies from an early age, Thomas profited from his attendance at Manchester Grammar during the regime of its reforming high master, Frederick Walker who had a reputation for ensuring that his pupils achieved the highest academic distinctions. Awarded a Brackenbury Natural Science Scholarship by Balliol College, he matriculated at Oxford on 20 October 1874, aged 17. Studying under Robert Clifton (physics), Henry Smith (mathematics), Joseph Prestwich (geology), Walter Fisher (chemistry), Henry Acland (human anatomy) and George Rolleston (biology), he obtained a second in mathematical honour moderations in 1876 and a first in natural sciences in the honour finals in 1877, taking his BA in 1878.  In 1879 he was awarded a Burdett-Coutts scholarship in geology, undertaking post-graduate study in Italy (Stazione Zoologica, Naples), France, Switzerland and Germany (Philipps-Universit\u00e4t Marburg).  He took his MA in 1881./nIn late 1879, Rolleston, the Linacre professor of anatomy and physiology, appointed Thomas junior demonstrator in human and comparative anatomy at the University Museum, Oxford, in succession to Edward Bagnall Poulton. His responsibilities included practical teaching of microscopic preparations, dissecting and practical classes in embryology as well as lecturing; his pupils included Frank Beddard (1858\u20131925) and Halford Mackinder (1861\u20131947). Under Rolleston's somewhat erratic supervision \u2013 his health was failing \u2013 Thomas was commissioned by the Royal Agricultural Society to investigate the sheep liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica), a parasite flatworm that in the winter of 1879\u201380 had caused the loss of some three million sheep in England. Thomas' preliminary results, which, critically, established the basic life cycle of the parasite, were published in 1881 and 1882, with his analysis and conclusions appearing in 1883.[4]  He was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society of London in 1882./nNotwithstanding his father's relative wealth, his academic success and the overt support of Acland and the master of Balliol, Benjamin Jowett, Thomas was unclear as to where he might gain more remunerative employment subsequent to his appointment to the museum. In October 1882, following a number of disappointments, he applied successfully for the professorship of natural science at the soon-to-be-formed Auckland University College (AUC), a constituent college of the University of New Zealand. Selected on the recommendations of Thomas Huxley and Archibald Geikie, he delivered his first professorial lecture, 'a special discourse \"On the Liver-parasite in Sheep\"' alongside Acland at the University of Oxford in February 1883.[5] Thomas, accompanied by his younger sister Lucie Vernon Thomas (1862-1932), departed from London on 8 March 1883 on the SS Orient. Transferring to the SS Rotomahana in Melbourne, they arrived in Auckland on 1 May 1883 to find that, contrary to what Thomas had been led to believe at his interview, facilities were somewhat less than rudimentary.[6] Until 1885 when Parliament passed the Auckland University College Reserves Act, AUC was the only university college in New Zealand without either an endowment or a dedicated campus.[7] As well as having to establish a new department encompassing geology, botany and zoology in - to quote Beatrice Webb - 'quaint ramshackle wooden buildings', Thomas was also required to teach mathematics following the drowning of George Walker, the professor of mathematics.[8][9] Not only was Auckland the physical and intellectual antithesis of Oxford but there was also considerable antagonism to the very existence of the college among Auckland's dominant commercial class with the Auckland Chamber of Commerce calling for its funding to be diverted to more profitable purposes on the grounds that 'a University is for the few and that consequently its usefulness is circumscribed.'[10]/nAside from having to lecture and research, the scientific professorial staff were also required to locate suitable premises, assemble books, specimen, apparatus and teaching materials, establish laboratories, undertake fieldwork and, notwithstanding the absence of any support staff, administer their departments. Thomas was also elected chair of the Professorial Board and in that capacity delivered the inaugural address at the opening of AUC on 21 May 1883.[11] In addition, there was an expectation that they would also examine secondary students, give public lectures, provide reports on scientific matters to various branches of government and be active participants in the city's intellectual life. Thomas joined the Auckland Institute and Museum in June 1883, and was elected to its council in 1884 and its presidency in 1886, a position he held again in 1895 and between 1903 and 1905. In his first year of membership he delivered two lectures at the Institute: 'Remarks on specimens from the Naples Zoological Station' and 'Remarks on Mr Caldwell's researches on the development of the lower mammals of Australia' and for the next decade he continued to deliver up to three lectures a year. Subsequently, he was appointed chairman of the Trustees of the Museum and, in that position, played a significant role both in establishing the museum's scientific reputation and in ensuring it was suitably housed and maintained./nIn the summer vacation following his arrival, between January and March 1884, Thomas travelled throughout New Zealand meeting colleagues at the other two university establishments, notably Thomas Jeffery Parker (1850\u20131897), professor of biology and curator of the University Museum at the University of Otago and Frederick Hutton (1836\u20131905), professor of biology at Canterbury University College. The visit both enabled him to assess the status of science in the country and provided him with the empirical basis on which he developed a teaching programme best suited to the needs of his students. It also opened up an informal network of local scientific researchers; he became particularly close to Parker with whom he initiated a research project focussing on the embryology of the Tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus).[12]/nWhile Thomas had good relations with his peers, his connection with the New Zealand scientific establishment, as embodied by James Hector, director of both the Colonial Museum and the New Zealand Geological Survey, manager of the New Zealand Institute and editor of its Transactions, was less congenial. Hector seems to have avoided meeting Thomas during his first visit to Wellington, leaving Thomas to observe merely that the Colonial Museum was 'old-fashioned' in appearance.[13] The influential Hector, a medical doctor by training, distrusted university-trained natural scientists recently arrived from the metropolis, such as Thomas and Parker. It was a view shared by James McKerrow, the surveyor general and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Hector's, who observed of Thomas and his colleague Frederick Douglas Brown, the professor of chemistry at AUC, that 'They are I fancy like some other learned men I have seen from Home, who have to unlearn a good deal after they come to the colony, and get quit of a deal of self-complacency. A very common notion of new arrivals, is, that Colonials are a sort of unkempt inferior race which it is the privilege and duty of them \u2013 the learned men \u2013 to make stepping stones of.'[14]  For their part, Parker, Thomas and Brown were not so much keen to step on 'colonials', but rather unimpressed by the descriptive, unanalytical, nature of the prevailing scientific methodology and sceptical of the rigour of its practitioners, many of them self-trained. Hector's animus against the academic scientists is suggested by his failure to publish many of the papers submitted to him in his capacity as editor of the Transactions and Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute.[15]/nThese tensions coalesced in June 1886 when the largest volcanic event in modern New Zealand history occurred at Mount Tarawera, 24 kilometres south east of Rotorua in the North Island. Following the eruption, the government commissioned Hector to provide a scientific report on the occurrence and its consequences. Undertaking a fleeting visit around the site he produced a report arguing that the eruption was, essentially, non-volcanic and of little scientific interest. As R F Keam remarks, 'No geologist today would accept Hector's model of the occurrence' and, even then, the deficiencies of the Hector report aroused criticism. In an effort to defuse the matter William Lanarch, the minister of mines, commissioned Hutton, Thomas and Brown to further report on the eruption. While Hutton evinced a degree of impatience in promulgating his opinion, Thomas was more circumspect and thorough in his fieldwork and his report, published two years later and separately from that of Hutton, was, in Keam's opinion, 'the polished product of meticulous research'; he further notes that 'Thomas would have been glad that he had distanced himself from Hutton's ideas on the matter'.[16]/nNotwithstanding the topicality of and his interest in geological matters, the wide scope of Thomas's academic responsibilities made it impossible for him to specialise. Almost immediately after his arrival he was requested by both colonial and municipal authorities to undertake investigations into a diverse range of biological and geological subjects ranging from parasitic diseases affecting rabbits in the Wairarapa district and the life history of flounder to analyses of water quality in Auckland. In a discussion of Thomas' report on the rabbit control problem, Paul Star notes that while he 'did not find a satisfactory disease,\u00a0... the publication of his reports introduced many colonists to a scientific approach'.[17] Thomas' lack of specialisation has led some New Zealand historians, such as Keith Sinclair, to assert that he was not a researcher of any significance.[18]  Much of this argument is anachronistic and demonstrates a failure either to comprehend the aims, purpose and function of applied scientific research at the end of the nineteenth century or to understand the circumstances under which Thomas would have been able to research at the level he had become accustomed to in Europe. Nonetheless, Thomas did produce significant research outputs, particularly during his first two decades at the university; between 1883 and 1903 he published thirteen scientific papers ranging in scope from observations on volcanic rocks of the Taupo district, notes on Tuatara embryology and an account of the prothallium of Phylloglossum. Although not present for the preliminary meeting of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) held in Sydney in November 1886 he was a foundation member and in 1888 was elected an ordinary member of the Association's ruling body and, with Parker, Honorary Local Secretary for New Zealand. At the AAAS conference held in Melbourne in 1890 he presided over the biological section, delivering an address lamenting the deficient state of scientific pedagogy, particularly at secondary level, the need for public scientific research and the failure of museums in some of the Australasian colonies to recognise their public role noting that 'It is over 30 years since Darwin pointed out how important and intimate were the relations of living beings to their environment. His teaching infused new life into the study of Biology but the enthusiasm does not seem to have extended to museums. One would think that the Origin of Species had never entered the doors of a museum. Most museums seem to be arranged chiefly, though most inadequately, with regard to the wants of the specialist, and the general public are scarcely thought of.[19] It was, effectively, a statement of what Thomas hoped to achieve in his work in New Zealand./nThomas' primary focus at AUC was on teaching and his research clearly informed his pedagogy. While University of New Zealand degrees were initially set and examined in the United Kingdom, he developed courses in both biology and geology that focussed on the local condition and emphasised fieldwork. His early students effectively developed those areas in which he had undertaken preliminary research. Thomas appears to have been an inspiring teacher. Alan Mason notes with respect to his teaching of geology that he was responsible 'for an explosion of talent, noting that, nationally, of the six senior scholars in geology between 1894 and 1903, five of them were from Auckland. Moreover, 'the Auckland achievement becomes even greater when we realise that of the three colleges in existence\u00a0... the Auckland college was the smallest and the poorest. The success came from a student base of less than forty i.e. an average of four first year students entering the department each year. Furthermore, in contrast to his southern counterparts, Thomas was the sole teacher of botany, zoology and geology.'[20]/nThomas's success as a teacher was not restricted to geology. His zoology students included Richard William Allen, MA (1899), Wooldridge Memorial Scholar in Physiology (1902) at Guy's Hospital, gold medalist material medica, University of London (1902), Gull student in pathology (1904), MB BS University of London (1905), who became 'a brilliant Harley Street specialist' and author of Vaccine therapy; its theory and practice (1910). In botany, John Ernest Holloway FRS, MSc (1905), DSc (1917) developed and extended Thomas's initial investigation into primitive ferns; and Kathleen Maisey Curtis, BA (1913) was the first New Zealand woman to win an 1851 Scholarship for study at the University of London where she was awarded a DSc in 1919. A mycologist at the Cawthorn Institute in Nelson, she was the first female fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand. Other students who distinguishing themselves included Elsie Mary Griffin, MA (1906), subsequently a key figure in the YWCA in both New Zealand and Australia. Writing to Thomas in 1912, Griffin observed that while he might think her 'a horrid \"suffragette\"' indulging in 'all kinds of bold & \"unwomanly\" things', she found her 'scientific training of immense value' in her work.[21]/nThomas' pragmatic approach to his teaching anticipated the development of an understanding of New Zealand's natural environment based on scientific method rather than on the fragmented observation of phenomena. Moreover, Thomas was not averse to criticising the focus of the British-set examinations conducted under the aegis of the University of New Zealand, arguing for example with A H Green, Prestwich's successor as professor of geology at Oxford, that while a general knowledge of British geology was useful for New Zealand students of the subject, the focus should be on the geology of their own country.[22] Thomas' recognition of the unique qualities of New Zealand biota paved the way for his advocacy of environmental conservation measures; while far from being the first to propose the preservation of the country's indigenous fauna and flora, his methodological approach laid the foundation for more scientific assessments of what had hitherto been proposed for preservation on the basis of 'natural curiosities'. As early as 1886 he was among those arguing at the Auckland Institute the necessity of introducing measures to conserve the rapidly diminishing indigenous bird population.[23]/nIn 1891, Thomas moved a resolution at the Christchurch meeting of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science, seconded by G M Thomson, encouraging the preservation of the native fauna and flora of New Zealand. His motion declared the need for 'the formation of one or more Reserves where the fauna (and also the flora) could be protected from the destruction which, it is well known, is overtaking so many of the rare and more interesting species'.[24] After considerable legislative inertia, his lobbying led to the formation of a conservation reserve on Hauturu-o-Toi (Little Barrier Island) in October 1894 'as a reserve for birds in time of peace, and for defence purposes in time of fighting'.[25] In April 1894, emboldened by the success of this move, he advocated the preservation of the native flora and fauna of the nearby Wait\u0101kere Ranges and subsequently was the chief speaker in a delegation that sought to persuade the Auckland City Council to acquire the region as a scenic reserve.[26] He was supporter and later chairman of the Auckland Scenery Preservation Society (1899), one of the earliest conservation pressure groups in the country.[27]/nOn taking up his appointment at AUC, Thomas initiated a scheme where, in the absence of any such facility in Auckland, the college grounds \u2013 such as they were \u2013 would be developed as a precursor botanical garden of indigenous flora. This engagement with applied science prompted an interest in horticulture and in 1890 he acquired a denuded ten acre (4 hectares) section in the Auckland suburb of Epsom which he and his wife Emily developed into an extensive garden while retaining its key geological feature, a remnant lava field of the nearby Maungawhau volcanic cone. Thomas designed a garden that with its winding paths, lookouts and naturalistic arrangement, while echoing the form and structure of gardens he had observed in southern Italy during his 1879 visit, was planted primarily with New Zealand flora. It seems probable that this was among the first P\u0101keh\u0101 gardens to employ indigenous flora as the dominant feature of a horticultural landscape. Thomas' initiative in reintroducing indigenous planting was emulated by a number of his neighbours, such as the surgeon Sir Carrick Robertson and the businessman Sir William Goodfellow, and encouraged the preservation of the remnant [[Almorah Rock Forest\n]], named for a nearby street.[28] Thomas was also responsible for designing the grounds of the nearby Auckland Grammar School (1916) and, most probably, was involved in the design of the grounds of Auckland's other grammar schools. As a development of his interest in applied botany, Thomas also became interested in the hybridisation of daffodils for which he gained both local and international recognition.[29]/nFrom the time of his arrival in Auckland, Thomas evinced a particular interest in educational issues outside of his college responsibilities. He was keenly interested in technical education matters, notably agricultural science. In 1888 he addressed these issue in a series of provocative lectures and articles published in newspapers throughout the country in which he argued that given its dependence on mining and agriculture, New Zealand could only benefit from the proper teaching of agricultural botany and chemistry at primary, secondary and tertiary levels. His articles in the New Zealand Herald suggest both an awareness of the work of Arthur Acland's educational reform lobby group, the National Association for the Promotion of Technical and Secondary Education and a recognition that this work had significant relevance to New Zealand. The association was an Oxford creation \u2013 Acland himself was an honorary fellow of Balliol College \u2013 and many of those involved with it had served as lecturers with the university extension programme at Toynbee Hall in London's East End. In a statement that retains contemporary significance, Thomas opined that 'The true way\u00a0... to protect the interests of the working classes is to afford them opportunities of acquiring such knowledge and skill as will enable them to hold their own in competition with the rest of the world.'[30]/nPerhaps surprisingly given its conservative ideology, the Herald editorialised its support for Thomas' progressive proposals, observing that 'Professor Thomas is distinctly of the present and of the future, as indeed his colleagues are, and it is on the fact that our professors have thoroughly caught the temper of the times, and have brought themselves in touch with the onward spirit of colonial life, that the best hopes are based that our University institutions will prove to be the most influential and valuable of our educational agencies.'[31] He also initiated a series of lectures on agricultural science at the AUC specifically aimed at teachers and farmers. For some years after, in the absence of any official activity, he provided advice and delivered lectures on agricultural matters to a wide range of agricultural organisations throughout the country.[32] Thomas, along with Brown, was also behind an ultimately successful move to establish a school of mines at AUC in 1906. By 1910 the AUC school had morphed into what Sinclair describes as 'a covert School of Engineering', a move that despite opposition from the University of New Zealand became official in 1923.[33]/nThomas's educational concerns prompted his election by the Senate of the University of New Zealand to the Auckland Grammar School Board in 1899, chaired by George Maurice O'Rourke who was also chairman of the AUC council. He was immediately elected vice-chairman and, in 1916, chairman in which position he served until his death in 1937[34] making him the second longest-serving chairman in Auckland Grammar\u2019s history.  Thomas' chairmanship of the board coincided with the last six years of James Tibbs' long period as headmaster of Auckland Grammar School. The younger Thomas had been a contemporary of Tibbs at Oxford and, given that both took mathematics honours, they were probably acquainted. But where Tibbs chafed under the provisions of the 1914 Education Act, Thomas seems to have relished the opportunity it provided to develop the Grammar Schools as intellectual powerhouses. Under Thomas' dominant influence the Board expanded the number of schools under its control from one, housed on an inadequate inner-city site, to five, all housed in new, well-equipped premises: Auckland Girls' Grammar School (1909); Auckland Grammar School (1915); Epsom Girls' Grammar School (1917); Mt Albert Grammar School (1922); and Takapuna Grammar School (1927). In contrast to his successors as chair of the Auckland Grammar School Board, Thomas played a highly visible role in the activities of the schools until his death. He was a vice-chairman of the Dilworth Trust Board, the body responsible for Dilworth School, between 1906 and 1937 and a member of the Auckland Teachers' Training College Committee of Advice between 1906 and 1914./nThomas was a member of the Senate of the University of New Zealand between 1899 and 1903 and, again, between 1921 and 1933. He was also a member of the AUC council between 1919 and 1925. He was the Bishop of Waiapu's nominated member of the St John's Theological College Board of Governors between 1910 and 1911./nIn October 1913, a newly elected Reform government introduced legislation into the New Zealand Parliament creating a governmental scientific advisory body, the Board of Science and Art.[35] Ross Galbreath asserts that the government intended that the board's primary function was to manage the Dominion (formerly Colonial) Museum and to publish scientific journals and reports, but its members appear to have had greater ambitions.[36] Along with six others, Thomas was appointed to the board by an Order in Council in 1915. He appears to have played a significant role in galvanising its activities, notably in calling for 'a central advisory board' for science and industry.[37]  But early moves to establish a scientific advisory body modelled on the British Department of Scientific and Industrial Research failed due to the absence of any significant political support. It was only with the visit in 1926 of Frank Heath, permanent secretary of the British DSIR, along with a decision by the British Empire Marketing Board to fund agricultural research in New Zealand, that a body to advise on the promotion of science in industry, also known as the DSIR, was formed.[38]/nNotwithstanding the suggestion of Francis Dillon Bell, the New Zealand Agent General in London 'that a Mrs Professor would be a very great addition to the colony', Thomas arrived in New Zealand a bachelor although there are indications he had an unsuccessful shipboard romance on the outward voyage. He was accompanied by his younger sister Lucie Vernon Thomas (1862\u20131932) who would act as his hostess and housekeeper until February 1885. Soon after his arrival, he purchased a villa at Narrow Neck on Auckland's North Shore. On 19 November 1887 he married Emily Sarah Nolan Russell (1867\u20131950), the third of six daughters of Mary Ann Nolan (1834\u20131931) and her husband John Benjamin Russell (1834\u20131894), an Auckland solicitor./nThe Russells were a well-connected Auckland family: J B Russell's practice, Russell & Campbell, was \u2013 and, as Russell McVeagh, remains \u2013 one of Auckland's leading legal firms; his eldest brother was the lawyer, politician and financier Thomas Russell. Emily Thomas was a well-educated, travelled, woman of progressive ideas; in 1895 she was nominated unsuccessfully by the Auckland, Devonport and Ponsonby Schools Committees for a seat on the Auckland Education Board. Unfortunately in 1905 and, again, in 1908 she experienced a specific acute reactive disorder that led to her being admitted to Ashburn Hall, a private asylum in Dunedin. She remained there until March 1950 when she was transferred to Kingseat Hospital near Auckland, shortly before her death. Thomas, a lifelong cigarette smoker, died suddenly in Auckland on 28 December 1937. The Thomases had four children: three sons, Acland Withiel (1888\u20131962), Norman Russell Withiel (1891\u20131969), Arthur Edward Withiel (1904\u20131992); and a daughter, Mary Wynfrida Withiel (1893\u20131974)./nBesides being a fellow of the Linnean Society of London (FLS, 1882), Thomas was a fellow of the Geological Society (FGS, 1888), a fellow of the New Zealand Institute (1905), and after its transmogrification from an Institute into a royal society, an original fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand, (FRSNZ, 1919) and an honorary fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Horticulture (1936). Following his resignation from the chair of biology and geology at Auckland University College in 1913 he was made professor emeritus by the college senate. He was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal in 1935.[39] In the 1937 George VI Coronation Honours Thomas was made Knight Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) for services to education, a then extraordinary distinction for a New Zealander.[40] Pallbearers at his funeral included the Hon Peter Fraser, minister of education and later prime minister in the first Labour administration.[41]/nThe Austrian naturalist and explorer Andreas Reischek named New Zealand's westernmost lake in Fiordland (45\u00b059'14.3\"S 166\u00b030'09.8\"E) after Thomas in 1887.[42] Following his death, the executors of his estate gifted 100 acres (42 hectares) of land at Piha to the Auckland City Council; this was supplemented in 1963 by the gift of Lion Rock (Te Piha), an eroded 16-million-year-old volcanic neck, that was acquired by two of his sons, Acland and Norman, from Te Kawerau in 1941.[43] These gifts were commemorated in 2008 with the naming of a part of the gift as the Sir Algernon Thomas Green. In 1968, largely on the initiative of Sir Douglas Robb, chancellor of the University of Auckland, the university's new biological sciences building was named in his honour. Following the subdivision of his garden, a road formed through the property (primarily through what had been his 'cow paddock') was named Withiel Drive in his memory, as was a 0.7-hectare (1.7-acre) reserve donated to the Auckland City Council in 1949 by his son Norman, which was based on a remnant of the Maungawhau lava field that he had preserved, Withiel Thomas Park.", "61681553": "John Robert Cumbers (born 1979) is a British molecular biologist living in the San Francisco Bay Area.

He developed the concept of thermodynamic buffering in metabolism that supports stable non-equilibrium dynamics of living systems. He introduced the concept of internal quantum state of living systems that maintains their computational properties and determines morphogenesis and evolution. Evolution of social systems is viewed by Igamberdiev as a continuous generation and interaction of reflexive models of externality that trigger social dynamics and establish the structure of societies./nAbir Igamberdiev is an author of short stories and essays on classical music, literature and philosophy in Russian.", "47263646": "Paul Bujor (born Pavel Bujor;[1] August 2, 1862 \u2013 May 17, 1952) was a Romanian zoologist, physiologist and marine biologist, also noted as a socialist writer and politician. Hailing from rural Covurlui County, he studied biology in France and Switzerland, where he was attracted by left-wing ideas; his evolutionary biology, informed by the work of Carl Vogt, veered into Marxism and irreligion. Returning to the Kingdom of Romania, he was a junior member of the Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party, active on its moderate wing. He earned the critics' attention in the 1890s as a short story writer with a socialist and pacifist message, but only returned to fiction writing briefly, in the 1930s. An award-winning ichthyologist, Bujor was hired by the University of Ia\u0219i, where he taught for 41 years, and throughout the period worked on documenting the Black Sea fauna, and made discoveries concerning the environment of Techirghiol Lake. He inaugurated the Romanian study of animal morphology, while also contributing to histology, embryology, and parasitology, and gave popular lectures on evolution and physical culture./nBujor rallied with the Poporanist movement, infiltrating the National Liberal Party from the left. He was among the founders of the leading Poporanist review, Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103, but expelled after expressing disagreement with its refusal to criticize the National Liberal mainstream. As an independent left-winger, constantly pushing for land reform and universal suffrage, Bujor had publicized and sometimes violent conflicts with his far-right colleague at university, A. C. Cuza. Elected to Senate as a university representative, and serving throughout the social upheaval of World War I, Bujor clashed with the National Liberal Prime Minister Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu, whom he accused of bringing disaster upon the country. In 1919, he was one of the founders and leaders of Peasants' Party, which became part of a successful electoral coalition, representing groups throughout Greater Romania; Bujor was selected as Greater Romania's first president of the Senate./nThe Peasantist attempts at constitutional reform, and Bujor's own signs of approval for far-left concepts, eventually led to a backlash in 1920. Deposed by King Ferdinand I in 1920, Bujor expressed hopes for a revolution against \"the oligarchy\", but he was gradually marginalized. After 1926, with disciple Ioan Borcea, he represented the dissident left within the consolidated National Peasants' Party, openly criticizing his party's leadership while serving as representative in the Assembly of Deputies. Bujor, still a rival of Cuza, professed anti-fascism throughout the 1930s, but withdrew from the public eye during World War II. He returned to prominence under the communist regime, when, at age 86, he was inducted into the Romanian Academy./nBujor was born in Bere\u0219ti, Covurlui County (now Gala\u021bi County), on August 2 (Old Style: July 20), 1862.[1] Some sources suggest that his father Gavril was a modest farmer or laborer,[2][3] but he actually worked as a clerk; his mother, Nastasia, was a housewife.[1] According to philologist Livia Ciuperc\u0103, Bujor made efforts to conceal his true origins, and, for this reason, eventually broke all contact with his relatives.[4] Hosted by his grandfather Varlaam, then by an aunt,[1] Pavel attended primary school in B\u00e2rlad, followed by the town's Gheorghe Ro\u0219ca Codreanu National College. As he recalled, during his early years there he received a school inspection from poet Vasile Alecsandri.[5] While living there, he was also roommates with Alexandru Vlahu\u021b\u0103, with whom he shared an enthusiasm for Mihai Eminescu's poetry.[2] Vlahu\u021b\u0103 reportedly wrote his celebrated poem Dormi iubito! (\"Sleep, My Love!\"), inspired by the sudden death of a B\u00e2rlad belle, while recovering in Bujor's room at the boarding school.[6] Bujor remained close friends with the slightly older writer, and stayed over in his house \"sometimes for days on end\".[7] He later described his meetings, through Vlahu\u021b\u0103, with two other major Romanian writers, Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu and Barbu \u0218tef\u0103nescu Delavrancea, claiming that he and Vlahu\u021b\u0103 also helped \"recluse\" painter Nicolae Grigorescu organize his first-ever retrospective exhibit.[5]/nBujor took his Baccalaureate at Ia\u0219i (1880), then performed his six-months service in the Romanian Land Forces, at a cavalry regiment, and ultimately enrolled at the Natural Sciences department, University of Bucharest, while working as a copyist in the Ministry of Internal Affairs.[8] At the time, he came to be influenced by Grigore Cob\u0103lcescu's materialism, which informed his worldview and attracted him to left-wing ideas.[9] Eventually, sponsored by his brother-in-law, he was able to fulfill his dream of studying biology at the University of Paris, under Henri de Lacaze-Duthiers.[10] According to other reports, he also received a Romanian state scholarship.[11]/nIn the French capital, he came into contact with international socialism, meeting Jules Guesde and Paul Lafargue.[12] Alongside his biologist colleagues Ioan Cantacuzino, Dimitrie Voinov and Emil Racovi\u021b\u0103,[10] he joined the students' socialist circle, presided upon by Ioan N\u0103dejde.[5] He also had friends outside the socialist movement, including Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu\u2014future leader of the National Liberal Party (PNL)\u2014, his brother Dinu, playwright Ion Peretz, and landowner Iuniu Lecca.[5] He also visited Alecsandri and Ion Luca Caragiale, the celebrated playwright and humorist, at his exile homes in Paris and Berlin. He would later recall that Caragiale was impressed by the \"socialist education\" of German proletarians.[5] However, it is known that Caragiale mocked Bujor in at least one letter he sent to Mihail Dragomirescu.[13]/nHaving done independent research in marine biology at Villefranche-sur-Mer,[14] Bujor moved to Geneva for specialized courses in animal morphology, under the guidance of Carl Vogt. He had been impressed by Vogt's work and transformist outlook, and was enthusiastic about taking courses under Ernst Haeckel; but he also found life in Paris hardly affordable.[10] Bujor was well-liked by Vogt, who made him part of his research team, and then also worked under Professor Wiederschein at the University of Fribourg; with Grigore Antipa, he began work on a vast project to study the Black Sea fauna, stocking up on specialized instruments.[14] He also continued his engagement with socialism, and attended lectures by Georgi Plekhanov.[2][12] He received a doctorate in natural sciences from the University of Geneva in 1891; the work described the larval stages of development in the brook lamprey. It was one of the first Romanian contributions to dynamic morphology,[15] and also won Bujor the Rousseau Institute's Davey Prize.[16]/nUpon his return, Bujor had a stint on the University of Bucharest teaching staff, and was an assistant in the physiology laboratory, under Alexandru M. Vitzu.[2][17]  Originally, he had wanted to fulfill his socialist vocation and resign to a schoolteacher's position. He was dissuaded from this by the Marxist philosopher Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, who noted that he could do much more as an academic.[16] This was also the time of Bujor's literary debut, which was also overseen by Dobrogeanu-Gherea\u2014in the 1930s, Bujor described himself as one of the writers \"belonging to the generation and literary school shaped by Gherea.\"[5]/nAlthough sometimes credited as a writer of the Contemporanul circle, Bujor was never actually part of that team, although he may have been in contact with it.[18] Instead, by 1894, he was a noted contributor to Garabet Ibr\u0103ileanu's Evenimentul Literar of Ia\u0219i,[19] and also wrote for Gherea's own review, Literatur\u0103 \u0219i \u0218tiin\u021b\u0103\u2014which hosted various of his \"countryside sketches\",[20] including the anti-war, didactic Mi-a c\u00e2ntat cucu-n fa\u021b\u0103 (\"A Cuckoo Sang to My Face\").[5][21] Written at M\u00e9dan, it depicted the tragedy of Dinu, a Romanian peasant drafted into the local militia, where he is driven to drink, then to murderous insanity.[12] According to literary historian George C\u0103linescu, \"the bourgeois state\" is the antagonist.[12] Other critics note that it was the first of several Bujor stories in which urban civilization is a factor for ethical dissolution, a theme \"idyllic and ideological\",[22] repeated to the point of \"obsession\".[23]/nAfter Literatur\u0103 \u0219i \u0218tiin\u021b\u0103, Bujor was also a contributor to Lumea Nou\u0103, organ of the Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party (PSDMR)\u2014although, according to fellow socialist I. C. Atanasiu, he did not involve himself in militant politics, being a regular party member.[24] The same Atanasiu notes that, on Labor Day 1894, Bujor acted as a courier for the PSDMR moderate mainstream, warning the party cell in Gala\u021bi not to invite in, nor respond to, police violence.[25] In the late 1890s, he and folklorist Gheorghe T. Kirileanu reviewed for print the debut short story of another intellectual from Gherea's circle, namely Paul Zarifopol.[26]/nBujor was eventually hired as a professor in the animal morphology department of the University of Ia\u0219i in 1895 or 1896[27] (tenured 1899).[12] In 1898\u20131899, together with Deodat \u021a\u0103ranu, he was also curator of the Medical and Naturalist Society, criticized by researcher N. A. Bogdan for their inconsistent, \"haphazard\" work at the numismatics collection.[28] Nevertheless, in 1901 Bujor became the Society's secretary general, serving until 1905 or 1906.[29] His research took him outside the country: with Voinov and Racovi\u021b\u0103, he worked as a marine biologist at Banyuls-sur-Mer and at the Stazione Zoologica of Naples,[30] returning with a rich collection of biological samples, which he donated to his faculty.[31] In 1903, with Alexandru Popovici and Leon Cosmovici, he held a pioneering extracurricular course on parasitology.[32] He then followed up with other such courses, in embryology and histology.[31] From 1904, his articles promoting physical culture among the peasantry were hosted by Cultura Rom\u00e2n\u0103, the popular pedagogy magazine,[33] with Bujor serving as president of the Ia\u0219i Society for Gymnastics, Sport and Music.[34] His efforts in that field led to the establishment of multi-sport venues in Copou Park, and the first ever chalet on Ceahl\u0103u Massif.[35]/nA dean in 1906, Bujor published an overview of his faculty's organization and funding.[36] Bujor then laid the foundation for Ia\u0219i's animal morphology collections; conducted research in descriptive and comparative morphology, as well as in hydrobiology and experimental zoology; and also organized the department's laboratory and museum.[31] He authored scientific articles in Romanian and in French,[2][37] conducting research into living organisms found in salt lakes. Bujor notably established the biological process whereby black mud is formed in Lake Techirghiol.[31] One of his generation's leading evolutionists, Darwinists, and evolutionary biologists,[38] in January 1907 he gave popular lectures introducing the public to the work of Charles Darwin.[39]/nBy 1898, with the PSDMR in the process of disintegration, Bujor had been drawn into the post-socialist agrarian current known as Poporanism, having already been its literary precursor, according to critic Alexandru Han\u021b\u0103.[23] Together with Poporanist leaders Ibr\u0103ileanu, Constantin Stere, and Spiridon Popescu, he entered the PNL in 1899, situating himself firmly on the left wing of the organization.[40] In later years, he continued to express his feelings of regret that the PSDMR had fallen apart, and that the movement had blended into a \"bourgeois party\".[41] As he noted in 1923, his friends' desertion from the PSDMR had made it possible for Br\u0103tianu to be elected PNL chairman, meaning that they had been used by him.[42]/nThis period also brought his sparse literary contributions to Vlahu\u021b\u0103 and Nicolae Iorga's traditionalist review, S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul\u2014by 1900, Bujor had met and befriended both Iorga and his associate in Ia\u0219i, professor A. C. Cuza, who espoused radical Romanian nationalism.[43] Bujor was also one of the few pose writers to contribute in its first edition of 1902.[44] However, by 1905, the split between Poporanism and S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul was irreconcilable, as Stere, Ibr\u0103ileanu and Bujor alike declared that agrarianism could only be progressive, whereas Vlahu\u021b\u0103 and Iorga defended cultural conservatism.[45] In October 1906, the press reported a \"lively conflict\" at university, between Cuza and Bujor, \"occasioned by the opening ceremony of the academic year.\"[46]/nTogether with Stere, Bujor became co-director of the newly launched Poporanist magazine Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 in March 1906, and was also one of the first contributors there.[47] During this period, he published in its pages the sketches Suflete chinuite (\"Tormented Souls\") and M\u0103car o lacrim\u0103 (\"If Only a Tear\"),[2] as well as introductions to marine biology. As noted with amusement by Dobrogeanu-Gherea, these were identical to pieces that Bujor had sent to be published in Henric Sanielevici's Curentul Nou.[48] Academic A. D. Xenopol liked the works overall, remarking their \"beautiful scientific language\". However, he also objected to Bujor's reliance on neologisms.[49]/nBujor remained on the editorial staff until April 1907, when Stere objected to his ideological vacillation\u2014a dispute between them was aired in the daily Opinia, and Ioan Cantacuzino took his place.[50] For his part, Bujor, who now shunned the PNL, depicted Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 as a National Liberal mouthpiece.[51] The peasants' revolt of March 1907 had seen him and his friends Voinov take firm stands against the repressive government of Dimitrie Sturdza.[52]/nBy then, Bujor also contributed to several other literary magazines, including Arta, Lupta, Noua Revist\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103, and Revista Literar\u0103 \u0219i \u0218tiin\u021bific\u0103 (where he was editing secretary),[2] and also to newspapers such as Opinia and Tribuna Conservatoare.[11] His short stories were collected as Mi-a c\u00e2ntat cucu-n fa\u021b\u0103 (1910).[2][53] In 1911, Bujor published the essay Foamea \u0219i iubirea \u00een lupta pentru existen\u021b\u0103 (\"Hunger and Love in the Fight for Existence\"),[36] and, with Cantacuzino, Gheorghe Marinescu, and Francisc Rainer, founded the international journal Annales de Biologie.[54] This activity was followed in 1913 by a piece advocating democratization and land reform (Reforma electoral\u0103 \u0219i agrar\u0103).[55] At the time, Bujor warned the establishment that the peasants' revolt would repeat itself unless land would be divided among the landless.[56]/nThose years accentuated his conflict with Cuza: in October 1909, when he planned to speak at university about the execution of Francisco Ferrer by the Spanish restoration government, his address was violently interrupted by far-right students.[57] In 1911, he reportedly refused to be granted the Bene-Merenti medal by King Carol I, because Cuza, suspected of plagiarism, was also a recipient;[58] however, he later was created Grand Officer of the Order of the Crown, being received into it at the same time as Cuza, who was appointed Commander.[59]/nWhile marginalized by the Poporanist mainstream, Bujor found a disciple in his junior colleague at university, Ioan Borcea.[60] He also cooperated with biologist Nicolae Leon, sharing his commitment to irreligion, and criticizing the Moldavian Orthodox Bishopric for its consecration ceremonies at university.[61] On his own, Bujor founded a Darwinian Studies Circle, whose students reacted against professors who favored mysticism.[62] His Darwinian studies, carried by Revista \u0218tiin\u021bific\u0103 V. Adamachi, discussed issues such as parthenogenesis, and commented on Peter Kropotkin's Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution.[63] His other friends in Ia\u0219i included Octav B\u0103ncil\u0103, Eugen Heroveanu and Mihai Pastia, with whom he founded a bakers' cooperative, in early 1912.[64]/nBujor represented his university in the Senate from 1914,[2] the only independent in that chamber.[65] In July 1914, just after the Sarajevo assassination and during the drive to war, he was selected on Toma Stelian's senatorial panel, which proposed reforms to the 1866 constitution.[66] The period coincided with Romania's neutrality in World War I, with Bujor, by then a contributor to Petre P. Carp's Moldova newspaper,[11] involving himself in passionate debates at the university. Alongside his former Poporanist mentor, Stere, he supported Romania's collaboration with the Central Powers, and preferred war against the Russian Empire.[67] While sometimes credited as the author of anti-war Marxist brochures,[2] these were actually written by a namesake, Mihail Gheorghiu Bujor.[68]/nAt the Senate rostrum, Bujor suggested that no military operation was possible before sorting out \"social inequities\", as Romania's strength depended on peasant recruits. He debated the issue with the Prime Minister, his old friend Br\u0103tianu, who responded that the proposed social reforms were inopportune.[69] In 1916, Romania, under Br\u0103tianu's PNL government, entered the war against the Central Powers; by 1917, its territory had been invaded, with only Western Moldavia still under control. The cabinet and both chambers of Parliament relocated to Ia\u0219i. By April\u2013May 1917, senator Bujor was an ally of the opposition Labor Party and of breakaway Conservative Democrats, calling for more progressive policies than the National Liberals offered. During those months, he joined a parliamentary commission on land reform\u2014although, as PNL man Ion G. Duca notes, these were dominated \"by the great landowners, since Br\u0103tianu's goal was to get those most affected by the reforms to support them as well.\"[70] On May 30, he signed up to a list of demands formulated by the Conservative Democrat dissidents Ion C. Gr\u0103di\u0219teanu and Constantin Argetoianu, which argued that the PNL's plan to enact reforms was \"political diversion\", one meant to cover Br\u0103tianu's contribution to the \"national disaster\".[71] Duca found this oratory \"of no interest at all\", simply dismissing Bujor as the \"untalented and irrelevant\" version of Matei B. Cantacuzino.[72] In the end, Bujor was not among the five senators who voted against reforms as proposed by Br\u0103tianu.[73]/nThe country appeared beaten by early 1918, when she signed an armistice with Germany. Bujor emerged from the Laborer Party (Partidul Muncitor), which he helped establish, from the remnants of Labor Party chapters, in November 1918\u2014just as the world war was ending. The group included other academics (Borcea and Constantin Ion Parhon), and produced collectivist programs, some of which were signed by Bujor himself.[74] In parallel, Bujor and B\u0103ncil\u0103 adhered to the Brotherhood of Unified Moldavia, a regionalist organization which also regrouped some of his right-wing rivals\u2014including both Cuza and Iorga.[75] In February 1919, the Laborites fused with the Peasants' Party (P\u021a), a Poporanist successor and rival of the PNL.[76][77] Subsequently, Bujor was elected to a seat on the initial central committee of the enlarged organization,[78] which now represented agrarianists throughout Greater Romania. As noted at the time by sociologist Dimitrie Dr\u0103ghicescu, he was one of many former National Liberals in the P\u021a, confirming claims that the Peasantists were only the \"impatiently democratic\" side of the PNL mainstream.[79] The Bujor faction immediately claimed a degree of autonomy inside the larger movement, forming tactical alliances with parties that the P\u021a as a whole disavowed.[80]/nIn the election of November 1919, which tested universal male suffrage and brought a relative victory for the Romanian National Party (PNR), Bujor returned as senator for his university. He also ran on the P\u021a list for the Assembly of Deputies in Ia\u0219i, and won, but renounced his seat in favor the senatorial mandate; Neculai Cost\u0103chescu also renounced, and the seat ultimately went to Gheorghe Ciobanu.[81] Bujor regarded this moment as a great victory for his cause, publishing a thank-you note to his voters, congratulating them for thus \"ridding the country of its internal enemy\".[82] He accompanied party leader Ion Mihalache during talks with the PNR and other parties, establishing a solidified government coalition. These discussions also involved Iuliu Maniu of the PNR, Ion Incule\u021b of the Bessarabian Peasants' Party, and both Cuza and Iorga as rival leaders of the Democratic Nationalist Party (PND).[83] As reported by Iorga, Bujor expressed his opposition to the centrist platform adopted by the emerging \"Democratic Bloc\", declaring himself a man \"of the far-left\", until Mihalache threatened to expel him from the party.[84]/nOn November 25, Bujor was officially designated as the coalition candidate for president of the Senate (Greater Romania's first-ever); he was formally elected on November 28.[85] In his speech thanking senators for casting their vote, Bujor again voiced his radicalism, asserting that \"dawn shows itself from the East\", a discreet allusion to the October Revolution.[4][76][86] This generated outrage among opposition members, particularly PNL-ists and Progressive Conservatives who accused him of pro-Bolshevik sympathies.[86] Bujor also had debates with the nationalist senator Ilie Ro\u0219oag\u0103, when the latter proposed a vote to recognize Romanian-inhabited portions of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic as irrendenta. Bujor advocated a d\u00e9tente \"between us and our neighbors\", and insisted that Romanian Ukrainians would not be forgotten for that.[87] Overall, Bujor endured as a \"timidly democratic socialist\" (according to C\u0103linescu),[88] a \"progressive idealist\" (according to the communist Petre Constantinescu-Ia\u0219i),[89] or, as seen by Dr\u0103ghicescu, a \"likable [and] incorrigible idealist\".[3] As argued by historian Radu Filipescu: \"Paul Bujor was seen by his contemporaries as a sentimental socialist, a peaceful social dreamer.\"[76]/nBy December, Bujor and his colleagues were also trying to obtain support from Alexandru Averescu and his People's Party. Reportedly, they convinced Averescu to accept a reform of the 1866 constitution; in the end, Averescu withdrew from the talks, and embarked on a rapprochement with the PNL.[90] During those weeks, in his many meetings with King Ferdinand, Bujor declared himself a constitutionalist, which the king reportedly found a constructive approach; to Iorga, he stated his intention to work \"for democracy\".[91] He was despondent when Vaida would not assign prefectures to P\u021a men, declaring that the opportunity for a regime change had been lost.[92] Renewing his support for land reform, Bujor was again a noted critic of the antisemitic Cuza, whom he accused of wanting to destroy the university with his mystical rhetoric and his violent actions.[93] He was also reportedly upset that Cuza was the government's key man in Ia\u0219i.[94]/nDuring the early months of 1920, Bujor reverted to a more uncompromising stance, voting to put pressure on the king and thus force into law Mihalache's land reform proposal. On March 12\u201313, the king informed him and Iorga that he expected Democratic Bloc ministers to resign, with Bujor protesting, in vain, that the regime being revoked was \"good for the country\".[95] When Averescu took over as Prime Minister, Bujor, waiting to be deposed from his Senate chairmanship, was one of several calling Bloc leaders still calling for resistance.[96] The Democratic Bloc fell apart on March 18, and Bujor was one of those supporting the divorce, with hopes of renegotiating alliances; two days later, he also streamlined an alliance with Iorga's half of the PND.[97] Bujor was one of the P\u021a delegates on the bureau of the resulting Federation of National Social Democracy (FDNS). Other leading members were Vaida, Maniu, Mihalache, Nicolae L. Lupu, Ion Nistor, Virgil Madgearu, and Ion Incule\u021b.[98] As Iorga notes, during the banquet marking this alliance, Bujor perplexed those in the audience by again mentioning his revolutionary credentials and, obliquely, his proletarian internationalism.[99]/nDuring July, Bujor in the Senate and Mihalache in the Assembly reintroduced for debate their radical version of land reform. Both proposals were ignored, and parliament only debated a more conservative project, advanced by Averescu's Agriculture Minister, Constantin Garoflid; this incensed the FDNS to address the peasants directly, with leaflets condemning the lawmaking-landowners.[100] Alongside Iorga, Bujor also proposed the nationalization of underground resources, against Garoflid, who wanted the subsoil placed under a mixed property regime.[101] As the Democratic Nationalists split, with Cuza backing Averescu, Bujor openly celebrated Iorga as the more progressive nationalist, one \"in the spirit of the times\".[102]/nDuring 1921, Bujor joined a parliamentary board of inquiry into the Romanian administration of Bessarabia, presided upon by Nicolae Constantin Batzaria. Alongside Vasile S\u0103car\u0103 and others, he inspected Cahul County, where he recorded various cases of official misconduct, including theft of property and beatings.[103] During the constitutional debates, he supported the (ultimately defeated) women's suffrage motion presented by George Meitani, arguing that the graduation of women into politics was \"a necessity imposed on us by the social conditions\". Women, he noted, had proven themselves competent workers and managers during the war years.[104]/nAhead of the 1922 elections, with Br\u0103tianu again returning in power, Bujor declared an all-out fight with the \"oligarchy\" for the \"holy rights of liberty and justice.\" He optimistically argued that the \"three-headed dragon\" would be defeated by the \"fire-sword archangel\" of democracy, claiming that the fall of the Vaida cabinet was just a symptom of the PNL's losing struggle.[105] During those weeks, he and Ion R\u0103ducanu were the two P\u021a envoys negotiating an alliance with the PNR, the Conservative Democrats, and the Progressive Conservatives.[106] He himself was returned to the Senate, when he defended himself against renewed accusations, voiced by the PNL's Victor Iamandi, that he had \"really done it\" with his \"dawn in the East\" statement. Bujor dismissed this, arguing that Iamandi and his National Liberals were picking up on any detail that might help them silence the opposition.[76] However, following the establishment and immediate repression of the Romanian Communist Party, Bujor appeared as a defense witness in the Dealul Spirii Trial, where he spoke favorably of communists such as Timotei Marin.[107]/nBujor unsuccessfully fought against the 1923 constitution, proposed by a PNL-dominated Assembly. In his editorial for Adev\u0103rul in March 1923, he declared the PNL to be a party of the far-right, penetrated not just by oligarchy, but also by the \"obscurantism\" of extremist movements. He also accused the formerly progressive Br\u0103tianu of \"cowardice\" for having gone back on promises for proportional representation.[42] With the Bessarabian Vasile Stroescu, and with many other activists and socialists, he founded in August the League for Human Rights.[108] In October 1924, speaking both in parliament and at university, Bujor condemned Cuza's disciple, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, for the assassination of Constantin Manciu\u2014described by him as an \"odious\" deed, one ultimately inspired by Cuza and the National-Christian Defense League.[109]/nIn the June 1926 election, Bujor won an Assembly seat for Ia\u0219i County, as one of two deputies not affiliated with the People's Party; the other was Cuza for the Defense League.[110] Eventually, Bujor followed the Peasantists into merger with the PNR, thus joining the consolidated National Peasants' Party (PN\u021a). He was head of its Ia\u0219i chapter until June 1928, when he resigned without renouncing his membership. Responding to rumors that he was going to rejoin the PNL, Bujor announced that the only two parties he supported were the PN\u021a and the Social Democrats.[111]/nAlthough the PN\u021a carried the elections of December 1928, both Bujor and Borcea remained on the group's far-left, criticizing perceived fascist tendencies on the right, and were, overall, largely inactive members.[112] Such internal opposition was expressed in October 1930, when Bujor wrote another Adev\u0103rul editorial asking for the inclusion of Social Democratic ministers. He also denounced the PN\u021a \"oligarchy\", portraying Iuliu Maniu as a dictator and exposing Vaida as a \"reactionary antisemite\", guilty of having \"massacred innocent workers at Lupeni\".[113] In parallel interviews for Adev\u0103rul, he and the former socialist Atanasiu were debating whether the PSDMR had any chance of surviving the 1898 split: while Bujor suggested that it did, Atanasiu insisted that Romania was not ripe for socialism.[41] Bujor's other political involvement was with the Action Committee of the League Against War, where he was colleagues with another Ia\u0219i academic, Iorgu Iordan.[114]/nAmong his last academic assignments was touring Greater Romania on an examination commission, testing the Romanian-language aptitudes of the teaching staff inherited from Austria-Hungary. His irreligion interfered with this project: he decided to examine Jewish professors from Oradea on August 11, 1934, which was a Shabbat.[115] After 40 years of teaching, Bujor retired from his university chair in 1936.[2][116] By then, his pupil Borcea had died, leaving him to deplore the loss of a \"dutiful professor and citizen\", \"my kind and beloved colleague\". His death, Bujor claimed, was attributable to \"great sorrow\" over the rise of Romanian fascism.[117] In January 1937, a speaker at a PN\u021a youth rally which doubled as an anti-fascist demonstration, Bujor honored the \"precursor and martyr of peasantism\", Constantin Dobrescu-Arge\u0219.[118] By April, again formally affiliated with the Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 writers and their anti-fascist platform, Bujor expressed publicly his support for the novelist Mihail Sadoveanu, who was being targeted by the far-right press.[119]/nBujor lived all his remaining years in Bucharest, occupying a home at the Natural History Museum,[35] an institution which he expanded and modernized.[120] His final works in literature where the 1938 short story collection \u00cendurare! (\"Forgiveness!\"), titled after a piece in which the protagonist, a peasant, exacts cruel revenge on his oppressor; and a 1939 memoir, Amintiri de A. Vlahu\u021b\u0103 \u0219i I. L. Caragiale (\"Recollections about A. Vlahu\u021b\u0103 and I. L. Caragiale\").[121] The latter work, scholar Dan Jumar\u0103, remains \"convincing\" as a literary contribution, although it is \"written in the sociological manner.\"[120]/nFollowing World War II, Bujor returned to public life as an associate of the new communist regime\u2014Livia Ciuperc\u0103 describes him as a \"firebrand propagandist of the socialist-communist doctrine.\"[4] In 1948, when government revamped the Romanian Academy, he was elected an honorary member, his candidature personally endorsed by Traian S\u0103vulescu.[35] Decorated with Ordinul Muncii, 1st Class, he also received a seat on the Grivi\u021ba people's council in the 1950 local elections.[35] His selected prose appeared in 1951 as Scrieri alese.[120] As Bujor himself explained in articles for the official newspaper Sc\u00eenteia, he was also co-opted by the World Peace Council, holding political meetings with Grivi\u021ba workers to condemn the \"imperialist governments of the West.\" He also noted: \"I deeply regret that my advanced age will not permit me to be as active in this as I would like.\"[122]/nNevertheless, in his last years, Bujor was plagued by financial uncertainty, and resorted to petitioning the state for an increase of his income.[4] He died at his museum home in Bucharest on May 17, 1952,[4][35] and was incinerated at Cenu\u0219a crematorium that same day. The ceremony was attended by a delegation from Ia\u0219i university, headed by Teofil Vescan, and by academicians \u0218tefan Vencov and Nicolae S\u0103l\u0103geanu.[123] His ashes were then deposited near the mausoleum in Carol Park.[124] Among his papers was a short story, preserved by the Museum of Romanian Literature and only published in 2014 by Dacia Literar\u0103. Titled B\u0103rbu\u021b\u0103 L\u0103utarul, it has for an eponymous protagonist a Romany violinist, or l\u0103utar, marginalized and left to starve by the phonograph.[125]", "53587872": "Peter Hausen was a German developmental biologist who spent most of his career at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, where he was appointed Director of the Department of Cell Biology in 1973.

Classic of ecology, he would devote most of his later life to the research of antibiotics./nGause was born December 27, 1910, in Moscow, Russia to parents Frants Gustavovich Gause, a professor of architecture at Moscow State University, and Galina Gause, an industrial worker at an automotive steel plant. As a boy and into his teenage years, Gause and his extended family took summer vacations to the Caucasus Mountains in southern Russia for months at a time.[1] Although his family was not wealthy, they were allowed these respites because his father, being a government architect, helped to build many structures at the university. It was during these trips to the Caucasus Mountains that Gause grew fond of nature, often chronicling the lives and behavior of several organisms including the Siberian grasshopper (Aeropus sibiricus). He became interested in zoology, particularly the animal variability./nIn 1927 he was admitted to the Biological Division of the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics at Moscow University. The Russian university system requires a faculty advisor for all undergraduate and graduate students. His chosen advisor for his undergraduate career was professor Vladimir Alpatov, who worked at the Zoological Museum of Moscow University. Alpatov, in the mid-1920s, was very impressed by the work of Raymond Pearl, a U.S. demographer who became well-known through his advocacy of the logistic curve.[2] Alpatov brings back a fascination for American science that is very influential on Gause.[3] Gause argued that field work, with too many variables, could never adequately explain this relationship and only in the simplified laboratory environment, where variables could be controlled, would it be possible to determine precisely how a specific ecological factor influences a population. Eager to pursue this mechanistic direction of study and influenced by his advisor, Gause contacted Pearl to see if the American would take on another Russian student. He applied for a fellowship through the Rockefeller Foundation but was denied, perhaps because he was only 22 years old. He then published a monograph The Struggle for Existence in 1934 to improve his chances but he was still denied. The monograph had several editions, and it was also translated in French and Japanese languages./nDuring Alpatov's stay in the US, Gause was supervised by Evgenii Smirnov. Interested in the application of statistics in biosystematics, Smirnov promoted these methods to Gause. In that period Gause was investigating the distribution of Orthoptera in the North Caucasus, quantitatively estimating ecoplastisity of species./nGause earned his BSc at Moscow State University in 1931, and was employed in Alpatov's laboratory at the Zoological Institute of Moscow University. He earned his DBiolSc in 1936 for the series of works published in 1930-1934 and compiled as a dissertation titled Studies on the dynamics of mixed populations. One of the opponents was Vladimir Vernadsky./nIn 1932, Gause published what has become known as the competitive exclusion principle, based on experimental work done with mixed cultures of both yeast and Paramecium species.[4] Aphoristically, it was formulated as \"One niche \u2014 one species\".[5] The principle asserts that no two species with similar ecological niches can coexist in a stable equilibrium, meaning that when two species compete for exactly the same requirements, one will be slightly more efficient than the other and will reproduce at a higher rate as a result. The fate of the less efficient species is local extinction./nIn another series of experiments with the infusorians Paramecium as prey and Didinium as a predator, imitating periodical migrations, he obtained nearly ideally sinusoidal fluctuations of the abundances in this model, previously modeled only theoretically. It appeared in English as an abridged version in USA, and finally published in Russian only in 1984./nOne of the first acceptances of the advantages of polycultures was also obtained by Gause on Paramecium. He studied ecologically similar species of infusorians. Keeping them as monocultures he obtained higher abundances of individual species than in polyculture. Meanwhile, significantly higher was the overall abundance of the polyculture./nIn 1940 Gause prepares a monograph Ecology and some problems of the origin of species. The original manuscript in Russian was not published due to start of the World War II in the Soviet Union. It appeared in as an abridged version in USA, and finally published in Russian only in 1984./nIn the 1930s Gause conducted a series of studies, dedicated to the protoplasm asymmetry. These works raised interest among biogeochemists, including V.V. Vernadsky./nFrom 1939 Gause began studies of antibiotics. Seemed like a sudden change in research topic, but this was a development of his interests in the struggle for survival, and antibiotic activity was a mean. Later he focuses his research on practical applications for his new principle and turns to microbiology and medical science. Working with a strain of Bacillus brevis, he noticed an inhibition on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus when the two were in mixed culture. The inhibition of S. aureus was caused by a metabolite produced by B. brevis. Gause isolated this product and named it Gramicidin S.[6] The antibiotic went into mass production during World War II and saved many lives. For his part in its development, Gause was awarded the Stalin Prize and named director of the Institute for New Antibiotics in Moscow in 1946. As director, Gause helped to design and manufacture many novel antibiotics of which a few had anti-tumor capacities.[7] Due to such abrupt change in scientific interests many biologists failed to unite the evolutionist and the microbiologist in one personality.", "77762": "Emil Christian Hansen (8 May 1842 \u2013 27 August 1909) was a Danish mycologist and fermentation physiologist./nBorn in Ribe, he financed his education by writing novels.

He is mainly known for his work on infectious diseases. His works paved the way for the beginning of modern bacteriology, and inspired Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch. He was the first to identify a bacterium that causes diphtheria, which was called Klebs\u2013Loeffler bacterium (now Corynebacterium diphtheriae).[1][2] He was the father of physician Arnold Klebs./nKlebs was born in K\u00f6nigsberg, Province of Prussia. He studied at the University of W\u00fcrzburg under Rudolf Virchow in 1855 and received his doctorate at the University of Berlin in 1858. He achieved his habilitation at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg the following year./nKlebs was an assistant to Virchow at the Charit\u00e9 in Berlin from 1861 until 1866, when he became a professor of pathology at the University of Bern in Switzerland. He married Rosa Grossenbacher, a Swiss, and also acquired Swiss citizenship. He served as a military physician for the Prussian Army in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War; several of his ancestors had fought during the Napoleonic Wars./nKlebs taught at W\u00fcrzburg from 1872 to 1873, at Prague from 1873 to 1882, and at Z\u00fcrich from 1882 to 1892. Because of disagreements with the rest of the faculty, the impetuous Klebs resigned from Z\u00fcrich in 1893 and ran an unsuccessful private business in Karlsruhe and Strassburg in 1894./nFrom 1896 to 1900, Klebs taught at Rush Medical College in Chicago, United States.[3] From 1905 to 1910, he was a private researcher in Berlin, after which he returned to Switzerland, living with his oldest son in Lausanne. Klebs died in Bern.[1][4]/nIn 1883, Klebs successfully identified the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae as the etiological agent of diphtheria. This bacterium is also known as the Klebs-L\u00f6ffler bacillus.[5]/nThe bacterial genus Klebsiella is named in honor of his work.[6] Also Klebsormidium, which is a genus of filamentous charophyte green algae comprising 20 species,was also named in his honour in 1972.[7][8]/nKlebs' works preceded some of the most important discoveries in medicine. He described acromegaly in 1884, two years before Pierre Marie. In 1878, he successfully inoculated syphilis in monkeys, antedating \u00c9lie Metchnikoff and \u00c9mile Roux by 25 years. He isolated colonies of bacteria nine years before Robert Koch. He was the first to produce tuberculosis experimentally in animals by the injection of milk from infected cows. He identified the typhoid bacillus (now named Salmonella typhi) before Karl Joseph Eberth.[9]/nKlebs identified four \"Grundversuche\" (fundamental tests) that provided a basis for his own research strategy, as well as general bacteriological research. According to Klebs, the bacteriological tests consist of the following postulates:/nAlthough some of these hypotheses are literally false, they are in general the foundation of modern experiments in bacteriology.[10]/nKlebs made some significant errors about infectious diseases. He believed, for example, that malaria was caused by a bacterium. In 1879, Corrado Tommasi-Crudeli and he claimed that they isolated a bacterium from the waters of Pontine Marshes in Roman Campagna. They concluded that the bacterium was the pathogen for malaria as they discovered it from damp soil in the region of malaria epidemics. They gave it the name Bacillus malariae. They further experimented with the bacterial isolate which they injected into rabbits. They observed that infected rabbits developed fever and enlarged spleen, characteristics of malaria. They proposed that the malarial bacterium was transmitted by drinking contaminated water or inhalation from air.[11] Klebs reported that antimalarial drug quinine killed the germ.[12] The discovery was supported by leading malariologists of the time.[13] It was then declared that the malaria problem was solved. When a French Army physician Charles Alphonse Laveran correctly discovered in 1880 that malaria was caused by a protozoan parasite (which he called Oscillaria malariae, now Plasmodium falciparum), the discovery was ignored in preference of the bacillus theory of Klebs and Tommasi-Crudeli.[14] An American physician, though, George Miller Sternberg, proved that the bacillus did not cause specific symptoms of malaria in 1881.[15] The bacillus theory was eventually proved wrong by the experimental demonstration of the mosquito-malaria theory in 1898.[16][17]/nKlebs also made mistakes in claiming the existence of Microzoon septicum as causative agent of wound infection, and \"monadines\" as the pathogen for rheumatism.[1]", "1290186": "Giovanni Battista Amici (Italian: [d\u0292o\u02c8vanni bat\u02c8tista a\u02c8mi\u02d0t\u0283i]; 25 March 1786 \u2013 10 April 1863) was an Italian astronomer, microscopist, and botanist./nAmici was born in Modena, in present-day Italy.

This group met for the first time in Washington D.C. in the summer of 1892 to confer about improving the conditions of black children, women and the urban poor. Other notable women in attendance include Anna Julia Cooper, Helen Appo Cook, Ida Bell Wells-Barnett, Charlotte Forten Grimk\u00e9, Mary Jane Patterson, Evelyn Shaw.

Dunbar was known as the best high school for black students in the area, and parents would bus their students from surrounding towns just to attend the school and receive a better education. This school gave Datcher the ability to teach black students at a high academic level, while also earning parity pay with Washington's white school teachers.[2]", "53161957": "Dimitrios P.

He attended Harvard university (then known as the Lawrence Scientific School[1]) and was awarded the Walker prize of the Boston Society of Natural History during his first year for an essay about Myology and osteology of the cat. He graduated with a B.Sc. degree in 1883 and was awarded a Parker Travelling Fellowship.[1] He then travelled to Europe and studied with Rudolph Leuckart at Leipzig University in Germany. Leuckart specialised in parasitology as well as having some interest in insects, taking a morphological approach to both. Patten studied marine invertebrates with Leuckart's group, developing a life-long interest in embryology and evolutionary relationships. His work was supported by a fellowship from Harvard for three year's research in Europe. He was awarded a doctoral degree in 1884. He then spent a year at the Zoological Station at Trieste and another at the Naples Zoological Station.[2]:\u200a5/nPatten returned to the USA and between 1886 and 1889 acted as a research assistant at the Lake Laboratory in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the private research laboratory of Edward Allis.[3] While he was there, he hypothesised that vertebrates were derived from arachnid ancestors, and the exploration of this idea was important in his future research. Among others at the laboratory was William Morton Wheeler and Patten influenced him to study insect embryology and development using the cockroach as an example, which became an important part of his future career.[4]:\u200a210/nIn October 1889 Patten was appointed the Professor of Biology and Curator of Museums at the University of North Dakota. His research focused on the origin of vertebrates, considering that arthropods were more likely ancestors rather than the then-current idea of annelid worms. This led him to research the ostracoderms, extinct armored jawless fish, to support evolution from arthropods to them and then to vertebrates.[2] He also conducted other fieldwork. For example, in summer 1890 he was commissioned by the Botanical Division of the United States Department of Agriculture to collect specimens of grass from North Dakota for a project to determine if any were suitable for growing for grazing without irrigation. This assessment was undertaken by staff at the newly-established North Dakota Agricultural College in Fargo. He also gave talks to local societies, including on the subject of evolution.[2]/nIn 1893 he was appointed as a professor at the private Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, USA. The University of North Dakota appointed Melvin A. Brannon to replace him. Patten continued to work on the phylogeny of ostracoderms, scorpions and primitive fish as well some a minor interests such as the embryology of molluscs and arthropods.[2] He travelled worldwide during summer vacations to collect fossils, including to Australia, Japan, Costa Rica, Cuba, Labrador and the Baltic region. He became very skilled in revealing the fossilised remains from its stony matrix to see previously unknown fine structural details. His research supported his belief that ostracoderms were the ancestors of fish and linked invertebrates to vertebrates. Patten tended to work alone and rarely attended scientific conferences. He was a forceful lecturer.[1]/nBetween 1920 and his retirement in 1931 he gave a lecture course on evolution to all new students at Dartmouth College.[1] The content was probably a development of his course in Comparative Anatomy of Vertebrates that he started in 1898. This became a course where he and other members of the academic staff linked science, including evolution of humans and Darwin's theory, to other disciplines. It was a mandatory course for all new students which was both innovative and quite controversial. At the time, some states in the USA did not allow evolution to be covered in children's education. In 1919 he addressed the annual meeting of American Association for the Advancement of Science about \u201cThe Message of the Biologist\u201d[5] and followed this with a book The Grand Strategy of Evolution: the Social Philosophy of a Biologist[6] He outlined a philosophy of science in service to society that invoked chemistry theory, mixed with evolution theory and ecology.[1]/nHowever, by 1923 there was little opposition to the course and it was seen as a leading example of pedagogy.[7]/nPatten was the author of several books and many scientific publications.

She was the first to suggest that oxygen free radicals caused cell death and aging. After years of researching, Gerschman returned to the University of Buenos Aires and began teaching in the Physiology Department. She retired at the age of 77 from teaching and died several years later in 1986 from aplastic anemia.[4]/nBorn to a wealthy ranching family in Carlos Casares, Argentina, Rebeca was able to attend school at a young age.[2] When she was old enough, she attended the University of Buenos Aires and received two degrees in Pharmacy and Biochemistry. Following her undergraduate degrees, she began her Ph.D. under the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine recipient Bernardo Houssay. She completed her Ph.D. in 1937 about the determination of potassium in plasma. She worked with Agust\u00edn D. Marenzi to establish the Gerschman-Marenzi Method used for studying blood potassium levels and concentrations.[4]/nAfter completing her Ph.D., she moved to New York and began working at the University of Rochester in Wallace O. Fenn's Department of Physiology.[3][1] The research she conducted at the University of Rochester was a continuation of her Ph.D. work on blood potassium until she changed her studies to the physiological effects of respiratory gases on rabbits. Her work at the University of Rochester was partially related to post World War 2 military medicine.[4] In 1953 she wrote her famous paper, \u201cOxygen poisoning and x-radiation: a mechanism in common\u201d, however, it was not widely accepted in the science community because it opposed the scientific literature and views of the time. Gerschman was the first scientist to propose in 1954, that a toxic oxygen free radical reaction occurred in cells causing them to age and die.[2] The Gerschman Theory about the relationship of oxygen to aging and diseases was not accepted until 1969 due to the work of McCord and Fridovich on superoxide dismutase enzymes which confirmed her theory.[2]/nIn 1959, she was appointed a professor of Physiology at the new school of Pharmacy and Biochemistry at the University of Buenos Aires and moved back to Argentina. Gerschman was considered an unconventional teacher at the University of Buenos Aires because she used scientific cinema to visually show students topics and invited people from topic fields to speak in person.[2] In 1970, she was awarded the consulting professor position and retired from the University of Buenos Aires in 1980 at 77 years old.[3]/nGerschman became a huge advocate for women\u2019s rights in the scientific field because of her experiences.[2] In the 1980s, Gerschman was considered for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, sadly she did not receive the award because she was not able to participate in the interviews.[5] After years of being ill with aplastic anemia, Gerschman died on April 4, 1986, at the age of 82./nIn her honor there is the Rebeca Gerschman Award.", "26816550": "Steven Michael Goodman (born August 3, 1957)[1] is an American conservation biologist, and field biologist on staff in the Department of Zoology at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.[2]/nHe graduated from the Interlochen Arts Academy High School in 1975.

Ana was said to be a very intellectual child, learning to read and write already by age four. At the age of 13, her father died, and her family then moved to Bucharest, Romania. It was in Bucharest where she began her studies. She graduated from the Central School of Bucharest in 1915. The premature death of her father, whom she was close to, was said to be the reason she wanted to become a physician. Although the medical field was not a desirable field for women to enter, Ana Aslan decided that was the path she wanted to pursue and attended the Faculty of Medicine from 1915 to 1922. Her mother did not support this decision of becoming a physician because of financial strains, so Ana Aslan went on a hunger strike until her mother accepted her medical career. During her time in undergraduate studies, she attended to soldiers as a nurse during the First World War./nAfter graduating from the Faculty of Medicine in 1922, she began working with Daniel Danielopolu who supervised her doctoral thesis. She obtained her M.D. degree in cardiovascular physiology in 1924. Her focus was on physiology and the process of ageing. While experimenting on the effects that procaine had on arthritis, Aslan discovered other beneficial effects of this drug. It was this discovery that led to a three-year study and eventual invention of her drug called Gerovital (H3), which she prescribed for the effects of aging. With hesitation from fellow scientists that Gerovital was a \"fountain of youth\", Aslan kicked off a research study to prove the results. Over a period of two years, blood samples were taken from 15,000 people, with some of them receiving Gerovital and some receiving a placebo. 40% of the people who took Gerovital had less sick-leave days, and mortality rate from the flu epidemic was 13% in placebo patients while only being 2.7% in patients who took the drug. In 1976, with a pharmacist named Elena Polovr\u0103geanu, they invented another drug named Aslavital, which was a similar drug to Gerovital aimed to delay the skin aging process.[citation needed]/nAna Aslan received many international distinctions for her research activity, for example:/nAna Aslan patented two cosmetic products (hair lotion and cream Gerovital H3), entrusting their production to Farmec company and Miraj. The two companies have since diversified their range of cosmetics, and traditional procaine hydrochloride was eliminated from the formula.[1]/nAna Aslan was considered a pioneer of social medicine. Years after becoming the head of the physiology department at the Institute of Endocrinology of Bucharest, she founded the Institute of Geriatrics of Bucharest. Ana Aslan, in 1959 organized the Romanian Society of Gerontology and Geriatrics. The Romanian Society of Gerontology was the first in the world to channel its research into clinic, experimental, and social researches, devise a therapeutic strategy to prevent the process of aging, and organize a national health network for the prevention of aging. Her drug was used by many famous politicians and celebrities around the world, including John F. Kennedy.[citation needed]", "62271531": "Nicole Buckley (born 1960) is a Canadian biologist.[1] Buckley was the Chief Scientist for Life Sciences and ISS Utilization at the Canadian Space Agency.[2][3] Appointed to the role in 2009,[4] she worked to highlight the benefits of space science for all, particularly in regard to research on ageing in space.[5][6] Her current position is Team Leader for the SciSpacE team at the European Space Agency (ESA)./nBuckley studied Microbiology at the University of Saskatchewan, where she received her bachelor's and master's degree.[7] She received her PhD in Oral Biology from the University of Manitoba.[8]/n/nThis article about a Canadian scientist is a stub.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Cherry looked to identify novel therapeutic strategies./nCherry grew up in Brooklyn.[2] Her mother was born in Germany in a displaced persons camp and migrated to the United States. Her father was from Poland and passed through Ellis Island.[2] Her parents were the first in their families to attend college and eventually became academics at Brooklyn College.[2] Her mother was eventually made Head of Audiology at Brooklyn College. During her time at high school Cherry completed work experience in laboratories in New York City.[2] Here she studied the feeding habits of amoeba and proteoglycans.[3] She eventually studied chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, and graduated in 1994.[4] During her undergraduate research she looked at new synthesis pathways for drug scaffolds with Peter G. Schultz.[4] She moved to Massachusetts Institute of Technology for her doctoral research, where she worked on V(D)J recombination with David Baltimore.[4][5] During her research she recognised that, contrary to what was previously thought, demethylation was not responsible for the activation of V(D)J recombination.[6] It was under the guidance of Baltimore that Cherry became fascinated by virology.[3] When considering further research positions, Cherry knew that she wanted to learn more about viruses, and develop an unbiased, systematic genetic screening protocol.[3] She was a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School, where she worked with Norbert Perrimon on the development of high-throughput screening to monitor virus-host cell interactions.[4][7]/nIn 2006 Cherry joined the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.[8] Here she combined her experience with high-throughput RNA interference (RNAi) screening with other cell-based screening techniques.[4] Cherry studies viral pathogenesis, which includes both the ways viruses replicate and the anti-virus mechanisms within host cells. She is interested in how viruses hijack the machinery within a cell whilst evading their defence mechanisms.[4] She primarily studies arthropod\u2013borne viruses that impact RNA, including West Nile virus and Zika virus, as well as alphaviruses and bunyavirales.[9] Arthropod-borne viruses contain very little genetic information (around 11 kilobytes), but can infect and replicate in a variety of hosts.[3] Her research makes use of the model organism drosophila, high-throughput screening, functional genomics and forward genetics to better identify the genes that impact the life cycle of a virus.[9] In 2017 she demonstrated an inhibitor to Zika virus, a mosquito-borne virus that had previously evaded treatment.[10] Zika virus enters human cells through endocytosis, and bind to the cell's outer membrane via the clathrin.[10] Cherry demonstrated that the antiviral Nanchangmycin restricts this mode of entry.[10] Alongside her work in virology, Cherry has started to screen acute leukaemia patients to better understand how they will respond to advance therapeutics.[3]/nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic Cherry looked to identify novel therapeutic strategies, making use of her extensive small molecule library to identify chemical compounds that are active against SARS-CoV-2.[11] She has investigated remdesivir, an antiviral that was developed for the Ebola virus disease, and chloroquine, an antimalarial medication.[11] She used the high-throughput screening facility at the biosafety level-3 laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania to screen thousands of drugs at a time.[11][12] Remdesivir is a nucleoside analogue that tries to stop the spread of the virus by forcing it to make mistakes when replicating its RNA, causing the strands themselves to break. She has also considered therapies that prevent the virus from ever entering cells, either through the modification of the virus or the host itself. The treatment may also come in the form of an interferon.[11] To determine which treatments will be most appropriate, Cherry looks to identify which proteins SARS-CoV-2 makes use of for infection.[11] As the availability of N95 masks decreased, Cherry purchased several powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) battery-driven hoods that circulate filtered air for members of her research team.[13]/nSara Cherry is the head of a laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania's Pathology Department. The main focus of this lab is to research the connection between viruses and their hosts. Recently, they have been researching how RNA binding proteins and RNA decay machinery act within innate antiviral. This has been looked into and applied mainly on COVID-19. In the past, the Cherry Lab has conducted studies on the role of antivirals when it comes to COVID-19. They have been able to conclude that when nucleoside biogenesis inhibitors are combined with nucleoside analogs, SARS-CoV-2 infection can be blocked. Getting a better grasp of this concept is the focus of their future studies.

One such teacher was Ernest Everett Just, a prominent black biologist and head of the Zoology department at Howard University. Young graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1923.  Just tried unsuccessfully to help her to gain funding for graduate school,[5] but in 1924 Young began studying for her master's degree at the University of Chicago, which she received in 1926.[1]/nYoung worked with Ernest Everett Just for many years, teaching as an assistant professor at Howard University, from 1923 to 1935.[7] Research was done during the summers.

During the time she was concurrently studying for her master's degree, Young conducted research which led to the 1924 her publication, \"On the excretory apparatus in Paramecium\" which was published in the \"Discussion and Correspondence\" section of the prestigious journal Science.[8][3][4] Young was the sole author on the research article, making her the first African American woman to obtain a professional publication on original research in this field. This publication was revered by leading researchers of the time in the zoology field and was an international success, symbolizing the impact of Young's scientific achievements early in her career.[3][4]/nErnest Everett Just invited Young to work with him during summers at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts beginning in 1927.\nDuring their time in Woods Hole, Just and Young worked on researching the fertilization process in marine organisms, as well as the process of hydration and dehydration in living cells.[9][10] While conducting research at the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory, she presented research papers detailing her work there on three occasions, receiving additional funding in the form of three separate grants under the mentorship of Ernest Everett Just.[3][4][5][11]/nIn the late 1920's, Young served as the acting chair for the zoology department at Howard University while Ernest Just had travelled to Europe seeking grant money.[3][4][10][5] Young's eyes were permanently damaged by the ultraviolet rays used in the experiments conducted at Howard for Just.[5] During Young's time as acting chair, Just was able to publish a record 20 articles, a level of productivity he did not reach before or after working with Roger Young.[3][4]/nIn the fall of 1930, Young returned to the University of Chicago to begin her doctorate degree under the direction of Frank Rattray Lillie.[3] Lillie had been a mentor of Just while both were involved with the Marine Biological Laboratory. However, in 1930 she failed to pass her qualifying exams, and for a time, disappeared from the scientific community. She returned to Howard University to teach and continued working with Just at the Marine Biological Laboratory during the summers./nHowever, around 1934, rumors started circulating that there was a romance between Just and Young, and in 1936 they had a huge confrontation. Later that year she was fired, ostensibly because she missed classes. In her words, \"The situation here is so cruel and cowardly that every spark of sentiment that I have held for Howard is cold.\"[5] Whether related to academic performance or a romantic conflict, Just had created a paper trail of complaints surrounding Roger Young leading up to 1936 painting her performance as disruptive to the smooth operation of research and teaching at Howard University. He restricted Young's access to important research equipment, and finally in 1936, used his trail of evidence to fire Roger Young.[3][4][5][10] Young had this to say on the subject: \u201cYou seem to be making a deliberate effort to keep me from doing any research while in residence in your department.

In their paper,[8] they examined the effectiveness of using the Ricker and Beverton-Holt models models to estimate the potential yield of future generations by using data taken from prior generations. They addressed the problem that, in regards to fisheries, the parameters of the control system are often either varied or uncertain and the use of historical data becomes progressively more unreliable as it gets older. Variables, regarding these issues, include natural mortality and spawning rates as well the effects of human fishing, as a predator-prey relationship. Influenced by control theory, Hilborn and Walters modified the original models with various new formulae to create alternative models, in order to achieve more accurate predictions. They then identified \u201ca series of alternative harvesting experiments\u2026 each of which would be reasonably certain to discriminate between the alternative models\u2026\u201d[9] The development of these alternative models and harvesting methods has been invaluable in assessing the sustainability of the world's fisheries./nHilborn's research \u201caims to identify how to best manage fisheries to provide sustainable benefits to human society.

When it comes to large scale management of fisheries, he contends that there is \u201cno single solution, and what is appropriate for one community for a specific species may be totally different for another species or community\u201d[13] According to Hilborn, successful management strategies involve a combination of limiting access to fisheries, maintaining biological productivity and the cooperation of all stakeholders involved./nIn 2016 in a publicly posted 8-page letter to the President of the University of Washington, Greenpeace USA accused Dr. Hilborn of conflict of interest in the conduct of his research about the effects of fishing on the health of fish populations.[14]  Greenpeace alleged that undisclosed research and consulting funding provided to Dr. Hilborn from the seafood industry had influenced his research.

At a meeting in rural Maryland, he was covertly dosed with LSD by his colleague \nSidney Gottlieb (head of the CIA's MKUltra program) and, nine days later, plunged to his death from the window of the Hotel Statler in New York. The U.S. government first described his death as a suicide, and then as misadventure, while others allege murder.[1] The Rockefeller Commission report on the CIA in 1975 acknowledged their having conducted covert drug studies on fellow agents. Olson's death is one of the most mysterious outcomes of the CIA mind control project MKUltra./nOlson was born to Swedish immigrant parents in Hurley, Iron County, Wisconsin.[2] Olson graduated from Hurley High School in 1927.[3] Olson enrolled at the University of Wisconsin, earning both a B.S. and, in 1938, a Ph.D. in bacteriology. He married his classmate, Alice, and would go on to have three children.[4] Olson enrolled in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps to help pay off his college costs, and was called to active duty at Fort Hood in Texas as the United States entered World War II. Olson worked for a short time at Purdue University's Agricultural Experimentation Station before being called to active duty./nOlson served as a captain in the U.S. Army Chemical Corps. In December 1942, he got a call from Ira Baldwin, his thesis adviser at UW and the future mentor of Sidney Gottlieb, who would go on to be the CIA's leading chemist and director of MK-ULTRA. Ira had been called to leave his University post to direct a secret program regarding the development of biological weapons, and wanted Olson to join him as one of the first scientists at what would become Fort Detrick. The army transferred him to Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland. A few months later, the Chemical Corps took over Detrick and established its secret Biologicals Warfare Laboratories./nAt Camp Detrick, Baldwin worked with industrial partners such as George W. Merck and the U.S. military to establish the top secret U.S. bioweapons program beginning in 1943, during World War II, a time when interest in applying modern technology to warfare was high. Olson also worked with ex-Nazis who had been brought into the country through Operation Paperclip on the utilization of aerosolized anthrax.[1]/nOlson was discharged from the Army in 1944 and remained at Detrick on a civilian contract, continuing his research into aerobiology. In 1949, he joined many other Detrick scientists in Antigua for Operation Harness, which tested the vulnerability of different animals to toxic clouds. In 1950, he was a part of Operation Sea-Spray, where the bacterium Serratia marcescens was released into the coastal mists of San Francisco through a minesweeper, reaching all of San Francisco's 800,000 residents, as well as people living in eight surrounding cities. Olson traveled often to Fort Terry, a secret army base off Long Island, where toxins too deadly to be brought onto the U.S. mainland were tested./nThis was the period where senior military officials and CIA officers were becoming deeply troubled at Soviet progress, and feared they were heading towards mastery of microbe warfare. Their alarm led to the forming of the Special Operations Division at Detrick in spring of 1949, with the purpose of conducting research on covert ways to utilize chemical weapons. SOD was known as a \"Detrick within a Detrick\" due to its level of secrecy. Olson became acting chief of SOD within a year of its creation, originally invited to join by colleague and SOD's first chief, John Schwab./nAt some point while assigned as a civilian U.S. Army contractor, Olson began working as a CIA employee.[1] In May 1952, Frank Olson was appointed to the committee for Project Artichoke, an experimental CIA interrogation program.[5]/nBy the time Olson stepped down as chief of SOD in early 1953, citing \"pressures of the job\" that aggravated his ulcers, he had officially joined the CIA after working closely with them for years. He did stay with SOD, which functioned as a CIA research station hidden within a military base. Olson did a lot of work at Detrick that his children said had a lasting effect on his psyche. Olson witnessed and assisted in the poisoning, gassing, and torture of laboratory animals at Detrick, which his son Eric recalled having a deep effect on Olson: \"He'd come to work in the morning and see piles of dead monkeys. That messes with you. He wasn't the right guy for that.\" Olson also witnessed multiple torture sessions in international CIA safe-houses, where people were \"literally interrogated to death in experimental methods combining drugs, hypnosis, and torture to attempt to master brainwashing techniques and memory erasing.\"[6]/nOn February 23, 1953, the Chinese broadcast charges that two captured American pilots had claimed the U.S. was conducting germ warfare against North Korea.[7] \nOther captured Americans such as Colonel Walker \"Bud\" Mahurin made similar statements.[8][9]   The United States government threatened to charge some POWs with treason for cooperating with their captors.[10]  After their release, the prisoners of war would publicly repudiate their confessions as having been extracted by torture.[11] On 27 July 1953, the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed, launching Operation Big Switch, the repatriation of Korean War POWs.  Twenty-one American POWs refused repatriation and defected, and the returning POWs were viewed as potential security risks.  As a result, debriefings became \"hostile investigations in search of possible disloyalty\".[12] The day the armistice was signed, Olson, a bacteriologist, arrived in Northolt, UK.  Olson's home movies from the trip indicate he traveled to London, Paris, Stockholm, and Berlin.[13] Upon his return, Olson's mood was noticeably changed, according to his family.[14][15][16] According to coworker Norman Cournoyer, Olson had witnessed interrogations in Europe and become convinced that the United States had used biological weapons during the Korean War.[13][17] Journalist Gordon Thomas claims that Olson subsequently visited William Sargant, a British psychiatrist with high level security clearances. According to Thomas, Sargant reported that Olson had become a security threat and his access to military facilities should be limited.[14]/nOlson had spent a decade at Detrick and knew all the secrets of the Special Operations Division. He frequently traveled to Germany to witness interrogation sessions in multiple secret prisons (evidence places Olson in Frankfurt, Berlin, and Heidelberg), where the victims would occasionally die from trauma of the tactics used. Olson was one of the several SOD scientists who traveled to, or through, France in the summer of '51 when the French village of Pont-Saint-Esprit was poisoned by naturally occurring ergot, the fungus from which LSD was derived. If American forces did use biological weapons during the Korean War (there is circumstantial evidence but no concrete proof), Olson would know. The prospect that he might reveal what he had seen or done was a terrifying thought.[18]/nA semi-monthly retreat of the men closest to MK-ULTRA was scheduled at a cabin at Deep Creek Lake for Wednesday, November 18, to Friday, November 20, 1953.  A tentative participants list included twelve names:[19][20]/nOn Thursday evening around 7:30, Olson and some of the other participants were drugged with a \"potential truth serum\", decades later discovered to be LSD.[25][26] The next morning, Olson headed back to Maryland a changed man. Having dinner with his family, Olson refused to eat, and seemed distant from his family, not speaking about his trip or attending to his children. He blurted out to his wife, \"I've made a terrible mistake.\" MK-ULTRA had been underway for seven months at this time, and barely two dozen men knew the true nature and intentions of the project./nOn November 23, Olson and his boss, Lt. Col. Vincent Ruwet, arrived to work at Detrick, both still in bad shape from the retreat. Ruwet later recalled that Olson appeared to be agitated, and asked if Ruwet should fire him or if he should quit. While Ruwet was able to calm him down for the day, Olson only worsened by the next day. Ruwet later testified Olson was \"disoriented,\" felt \"all mixed up\" about the work he had been doing, and felt \"all mixed up\" and \"incompetent\" in his field./nOn Tuesday, November 24,  Olson went to work as usual, but unexpectedly returned home before noon, accompanied by a coworker, John Stubbs.  Olson explained Stubbs's presence, saying \"They're afraid I might hurt you.\"  Olson informed his wife that he had agreed to undergo psychiatric treatment.[5]/nThat same day,  Olson, Ruwet, and CIA chemist Robert Lashbrook flew to New York City.  In New York, Olson and Lashbrook met with Harold Abramson, a CIA-linked medical doctor, who had worked with Olson years earlier on studies of aerosolization.[26]:\u200a158\u200a[27]/nAround 2 a.m. on the morning of Saturday, November 28, 1953, Olson plummeted onto the sidewalk in front of the Statler Hilton Hotel (formerly the Hotel Pennsylvania). The night manager rushed to Olson, who was still alive and who \"tried to mumble something\". Olson died before medical help arrived.[14]  Years later, the night manager recalled \"In all my years in the hotel business, I never encountered a case where someone got up in the middle of the night, ran across a dark room in his underwear, avoiding two beds, and dove through a closed window with the shade and curtains drawn.\"[15]/nWhen police entered the hotel room, they found Robert Lashbrook sitting on the toilet in the room he shared with Olson.[14]/nThe motel's switchboard operator reported having connected a call from room 1018A to a number listed as belonging to Dr. Harold Abramson.  According to the operator, who overheard the entirety of the brief call, the occupant in 1018A reported \"Well, he's gone.\" to which the call's recipient had replied \"Well, that\u2019s too bad.\"[14]/nLashbrook's wallet contained the initials, address, and phone number of magician-turned-CIA asset John Mullholland.  Lashbrook claimed he and Olson had visited Mulholland, although this is disputed by author H.P. Albarelli.[20][28][29]/nAt the scene, and in their written report, the two police officers discussed similarities to the 1948 Laurence Duggan case, in which a high-level government official suspected of espionage died after plummeting from his New York office.[30][31]     The ensuing police report said that on his last night in Manhattan, Olson purposely threw himself out of the window of his tenth-floor hotel room at the Hotel Statler, which he had been sharing with Lashbrook, and died shortly after impact.[32]/nAlthough Olson's family told friends that he \"fell or jumped\" and had suffered \"a fatal nervous breakdown\" which resulted in the fall,[1] the family had no real knowledge of the specific details surrounding the tragedy, until the Rockefeller Commission uncovered some of the CIA's MKULTRA activities in 1975. That year, the government admitted that Olson had been dosed with LSD, without his knowledge, nine days before his death. After the family announced they planned to sue the Agency over Olson's \"wrongful death,\" the government offered them an out-of-court settlement of $1,250,000, later reduced to $750,000 (about $3.8 million in 2021 value [33]), which they accepted.[34] The family received apologies from President Gerald Ford and CIA director William Colby.[35]/nIn 1994, Eric Olson had his father's body exhumed to be buried with his mother. The family decided to have a second autopsy performed. The 1953 medical report completed immediately after Dr. Olson's death indicated that there were cuts and abrasions on the body.[36] Theories that sparked about Olson having been assassinated by the CIA led to the second autopsy, which was performed by James Starrs, Professor of Law and Forensic Science at the George Washington University National Law Center. His team searched the body for any cuts and abrasions and found none, though did find a large hematoma on the left side of Olson's head and a large injury on his chest. Most of the team concluded that the blunt-force trauma to the head and the injury to the chest had not occurred during the fall, but most likely before the fall (one team member dissented).[1] Starrs called the evidence \"rankly and starkly suggestive of homicide.\"[35]/nAlso in 1994, Eric Olson testified before the U.S. House of Representatives' \"Legislation and National Security Subcommittee of the Committee on Government Operations\" hearings on the US Government's \"Cold War Era Human Subject Experiments\".  He spoke about how the sudden and mysterious death of his father deeply affected his family and appealed to the Congress to help with their ongoing battle to get the CIA to release more details of his father's final days.[37]/nIn 1996, Eric Olson approached the U.S. District Attorney in Manhattan, Robert Morgenthau, to see if his office would open a new investigation. Stephen Saracco and Daniel Bibb of the office's \"cold case\" unit collected preliminary information, including a deposition of Lashbrook, but concluded that there was no compelling case to send to a grand jury.[1] In 2001, Canadian historian Michael Ignatieff wrote for The New York Times Magazine an account of Eric's decades-long campaign to clear his father's name.[1][38][39] Eric Olson asserts that the forensic evidence of death is suggestive of a method used by the CIA found in the first manual of assassination that says \"The most efficient accident, in simple assassination, is a fall of 75 feet or more onto a hard surface.\"[40]/nOn November 28, 2012, sons Eric and Nils Olson filed suit in the US District Court in Washington, D.C.,[41] seeking unspecified compensatory damages as well as access to documents related to their father's death and other matters that they claimed the CIA had withheld from them.[42][43] The case was dismissed in July 2013, due in part to the 1976 settlement between the family and government.[44] In the decision dismissing the suit, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg wrote, \"While the court must limit its analysis to the four corners of the complaint, the skeptical reader may wish to know that the public record supports many of the allegations [in the family's suit], farfetched as they may sound.\"[45]/nNetflix released a documentary miniseries, entitled Wormwood (2017), based on the mystery of Olson's death; it was directed by Errol Morris.[46] In the miniseries, journalist Seymour Hersh says the government had a security process to identify and execute domestic dissidents (perceived to pose a risk). He said that Frank Olson was a victim of this and an ongoing cover-up after his death. However, Hersh explained that he cannot elaborate or publish on the facts because it would compromise his source.[40]/nWriting for The New York Review of Books,  scholar Michael Ignatieff concludes \"Though I still resist the facts, the facts, as [Eric] Olson\u2019s research has established, are that Allen Dulles, Richard Helms, and other unnamed persons at the highest levels of the American government ordered the death of Eric\u2019s father [Frank Olson] because they feared he knew too much about US biological warfare during the Korean War and about the torture and execution of Soviet agents and ex-Nazi \"expendables\" in black sites in Europe during the early 1950s. Having killed him, the CIA confected the story that Olson's death was a suicide brought on by stress, and later attributed his jump from the window to the effects of a cocktail laced with LSD. It now appears that the LSD was administered, at a CIA retreat in Maryland, to discover exactly what Olson knew.

He is university professor and head of the Institute of Genetics at the Faculty of Biology of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.[1] Parniske's scientific focus is on the molecular interaction between plants and symbiotic and pathogenic organisms including bacteria, fungi, oomycetes and insects./nParniske studied biology, microbiology, biochemistry and genetics at the universities of Konstanz and Marburg, Germany. From 1986 until 1991 he performed diploma and doctoral studies in the laboratory of Dietrich Werner on chemical communication of the root with the bacterial microbiome with a focus on flavonoids and isoflavonoids. From 1992 until 1994 Parniske carried out biochemical studies on the interaction of plant transcription factors and DNA at the Institute of Biochemistry of the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research in Cologne, Germany as a postdoctoral fellow funded by the German Research Foundation. From 1994 until 1998 he studied the evolution of plant disease resistance genes in the lab of Jonathan D. G. Jones. In 1998, Parniske was appointed as an independent group leader at the Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich, UK. In 2004 he accepted a call for the chair of Genetics at the Faculty of Biology of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.[1] From 2011 until 2013 he acted as the Dean of the Faculty of Biology of the LMU Munich.

Topics taught include Genetics, Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions, Genetics and Society, Plant Nutrition and Sustainable Food Production./nParniske identified a set of plant mutants defective in plant root symbioses with both arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi and nitrogen-fixing rhizobia bacteria.[2] These mutants enforced the idea that plant root endosymbioses with bacteria and fungi share a common genetic basis. Because arbuscular mycorrhiza dates back to the first land plant and the root nodule symbiosis is much younger, this common gene set revealed that the nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis evolved by co-opting genes from the existing arbuscular mycorrhizasymbiosis. By map-based identification of so-called \u201ccommon symbiosis genes\u201d, the Parniske lab contributed to the identification of several components directly or indirectly involved in a plant signal transduction process required for both symbioses. These include a receptor-like kinase,[3] nucleoporins,[4][5] potassium channels required for nuclear calcium oscillations[6] and a nuclear localized complex comprising a calcium-and-calmodulin dependent protein kinase[7] and its phosphorylation target CYCLOPS, a DNA-binding transcriptional activator.[8][9] The discovery of these genes and the postulated signal transduction processes had a major impact on this research field. The Parniske lab discovered that CYCLOPS is an interactor and phosphorylation substrate of the calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase CCaMK. Moreover, the role of CYCLOPS, initially annotated as a protein with unknown function, was identified as a DNA-binding transcriptional activator.[10] Research in the Parniske lab clarified the role of the CCaMK/CYCLOPS complex as a major regulatory hub in symbiotic signal transduction./nParniske joined the laboratory of the plant geneticist Jonathan D.G. Jones at the Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich, United Kingdom in November 1994. He addressed the fundamental question in plant disease resistance research, how plants can keep pace with the evolutionary speed of microbial pathogens that have a much shorter generation time than their host plants and thus evade recognition by plant receptors through diversifying selection. Parniske discovered that recombination within and between resistance gene clusters is a key to the evolution of novel recognition specificities of pathogenic microbes by plants.[11][12]/nDuring his doctoral work Parniske observed that incompatible genotypes of soybean and rhizobia can lead to the induction of defense responses inside root nodules including the accumulation of phytoalexins, plant toxins produced upon biotic stress.[13] Parniske discovered that the soybean phytoalexin glyceollin is toxic for soybean rhizobia and that low concentrations of isoflavonoids secreted by soybean roots induce a resistance against this antibiotic plant compound.[14]/nIn 2013 Parniske received the European Research Council Advanced Grant for research on the \u201cEvolution of the molecular mechanisms underlying the nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis\u201d.[15] He received postdoctoral fellowships from the German Research Foundation (DFG), the EMBO and the European Union.

His first experience with pandas was seeing the world's first captive-born panda at the Beijing zoo where he got to hold the infant panda.[7]/nHe has also helped save the white-headed langur species through his work at the Nongguan Nature Reserve in Chongzuo, China. His work to save the langurs focused on both protecting the species, and improving the lives of the nearby villagers who were competing for resources with the langurs. The population of langurs declined from 2,000 in the late 1980s to just 96 when Pan began his work in 1996. Through Pan's efforts, the population has since climbed to over 500 in 2008.[8]/nIn his book The Natural Refuge of Giant Panda at Qinling (\u79e6\u5dba\u5927\u718a\u732b\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u5e87\u8b77\u6240) co-authored with postgraduates under his supervision, researchers and other collaborators, Pan put forward for the first time arguments supporting \u201cgiant pandas in Qinling can survive living in natural conditions\u201d  which was acclaimed by international peers to be \u201csignificant contribution to the biological theory of giant panda\u201d. Following that in his book Chance for Continual Survival (\u7e7c\u7e3e\u751f\u5b58\u7684\u6a5f\u6703) Pan commented that \u201csince the cause leading to the near-extinct of giant panda was human error, it must require human to rectify their acts in order giant pandas could have a chance for continual survival\u201d.  In the book The White Dolphins of Qinzhou (\u6b3d\u5dde\u7684\u767d\u6d77\u8c5a) Pan and his co-authors unveiled that Chinese white dolphin appeared in Beibu Gulf only from 6000 years ago and that in the Beibu Gulf population is preserved an ancient and rare genotype that is so far never found in populations in other territorial waters.  In the book he as well suggested that the social developments of Qinzhou must be planned to optimize a win-win situation between its economy and nature conservation for that is the only way to achieve sustainable development.  The Natural History of White-headed Langur (\u767d\u982d\u8449\u7334\u81ea\u7136\u53f2) is a live record of researches in wilderness.  When Pan went into the Nongguan Mountains he noticed there the sustenance environment was almost totally devastated and that \u201chuman was suffering more miserably than the langurs there\u201d.  In view of which he suggested \u201cthe core issue of nature conservation in Nongguan Mountains is to improve the living conditions of the people there.  Only after people\u2019s lives been improved could white-headed langur conservation be anticipated\u201d.  20 years practice of his words has proved his foresight; during the period the white-headed langur population in Nongguan Mountains has increased from the initial of about 100 individuals to about 820 individuals, and the people there have as well gradually improved their livings to well-off standard./nPeking University Press is proud to present the monograph series of Prof. Pan Wenshi.  How do we see the scientific achievements by Prof. Pan Wenshi?

In 1924 he became professor of physiology and histology in Groningen. From 1946 until his retirement in 1957, he was an extraordinary professor in Nijmegen and professor of psychology in Utrecht, although he had never studied psychology. [1]/nIn his younger years, acquaintance with Max Scheler, Hans Driesch and Helmuth Plessner (with whom he became friends) had a considerable influence on Buytendijk. He corresponded with many great philosophers, such as Binswanger, Guardini, Merleau-Ponty and with Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. [2] Frederik (Frits) Buytendijk got his inspiration and method from different sources: the experiences he had since 1918 as an animal psychologist, and after the Second World War as a human psychologist, and from phenomenology, the doctrine that makes the phenomena speak for themselves. In his General Theory of Human Posture and Movement (1949), Buytendijk succeeded in emphasizing a combination of body and mind./nIn 1937 the originally reformed Buytendijk became a Catholic. He was, among other things, chairman of the Catholic Association for Mental Health and from the end of the 1950s he was editor-in-chief of the Aula series, the popular scientific paperback series of publishing house Het Spectrum.

She was mentored by the famous ornithologist, Joseph Grinnell, at the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (MVZ) and in avian paleontology.[1] She was well known for her discoveries in the La Brea Tar Pits, among them the Rancho La Brea eagles. She discovered and described Pleistocene flightless waterfowl at the prehistoric Ballona wetlands of coastal Los Angeles County at Playa del Rey. In 1953, Howard became the third woman to be awarded the Brewster Medal.[2] She was the first woman president of the Southern California Academy of Sciences.[3] Hildegarde wrote 150 papers throughout her career.[4]/nHoward was born in Washington, D.C., and moved with her parents to Los Angeles in 1906; her father was a scriptwriter and her mother a musician and composer.[5]  In 1920 Howard commenced her studies at the Southern Branch of the University of California (later renamed UCLA).[5]  Her first biology teacher, Pirie Davidson, inspired her to change her concentration from journalism to biology; Davidson helped her get a job working for the paleontologist Chester Stock.[5]  She completed her bachelor's degree at U.C. Berkeley in 1924,[4] where she took courses in paleontology.[5]  That same year, Howard joined the scientific staff of the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History part-time; her work there on the extinct turkey Parapavo californicus was credited towards her master's degree, which was received in 1926[4] at Berkeley. She would earn her Ph.D. at the same university in 1928 with a dissertation on the fossil birds of the Emeryville Shellmound.[6]/nIn 1929 Howard returned to the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History and she held a permanent position there as a curator. However, she was not officially given the title of a curator until 1938.[7] Her initial title was Junior clerk and Howard's job was researching fossils from the Rancho La Brea as well as curating them. Named chief curator of science in 1951, she retired in 1961, but continued to conduct research and to publish on avian evolution. While at the museum and in retirement, Howard described three families, 13 genera, 57 species, and 2 subspecies.[4] In 1977 the Los Angeles Museum of History decided to honour Hildegarde Howard in the Cenozoic life Hall.[7]/nHoward married Henry Anson Wylde in 1930. Wylde, who would become chief of exhibits at the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, died in 1984.[5] Hildegarde Howard died on 28 February 1998 at her home in California, not long before her 97th birthday.[7]/nHoward published some 150 scientific papers over the course of her career.[4]/nSome of Howard's most transformative work was done at the La Brea Tar Pits. The La Brea tar Pits were filled with vast quantities of bird bones, which would provide extensive research potential for Howard throughout her life. Howard's first introduction to the field was sorting bones from La Brea at the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, where she would also meet her future husband Henry Anson Wylde.[7]/nIn Howard's New Avian Fossil research she found an extinct family of seabirds.[7] Howard was allowed to research a coracoid bone (between the shoulder blade and sternum) discovered for a species of bird not yet known by the public record. She concluded through previous evidence and modern avians that the bird was a previously unknown species of water bird by the shape of the shoulder and chest bone.[8]  She named this family of pelecaniformes seabirds plotopteridae.[7]/nHoward conducted an experiment in which she took wasps from their home ecosystem and brought them to a greenhouse to see how they would take to the conditions of isolation and whether or not they would nest in that environment.[9] After corrections to the methodology of the experiment, she was able to collect 41 nests to study the structure of their nesting.[9]/nHoward's 1929 dissertation, \"The Avifauna of Emeryville Shellmound\" was particularly influential at the time. The dissertation she wrote thoroughly labelled ornithological fossil specimens, and paired the terms with visual representations.[4] This allowed common terminology to be taught and widely popularized her work in the field.[4] Her diagrams were eventually phased out after Nomina Anatomica Avium was published in 1997.[4] The Avifauna of Emeryville Shellmound was important because it set the grounds of vocabulary for avian paleontology.[10] Howard detailed, named and labelled a baseline for the skeletal makeup of all birds.[10] This work solidified her significance in the world of paleontology and continues to stay a point of agreement for paleontologists of all levels.[10] The names used are still widely referenced and give a strong baseline when labelling unknown species.[10]/nHoward compared two studies regarding the Pleistocene animals of the Rancho La Brea region.[11] One of them was a census conducted by Dr. Chester Stock regarding mammals of the region, while the other was a census of the birds.[11] This entry sought the common factors, if any, between the two groups.\u00a0She found that there was a limitation on the age of the animals from the Rancho La Brea exhibit. This effect was only manifested in the specimens that came from the early to the middle part of the late Pleistocene era.[11]/nIn this paper, Howard examined the possibility of regeneration after a man claimed that a Northern pintail duck who had its wing shot off was able to grow it back. When the specimen was submitted to the Los Angeles Museum,[13] it was noted that there was a new portion joined to the old portion. The entry detailed this evidence; however, Howard did not conclude that this was the regeneration of the bones, since it had never been recorded before. She kept the possibility open because of the close relation between reptiles and birds, since reptiles have the ability to regenerate.[13]/nAt the Los Angeles Museum, a collection called Rancho La Brea contains the bones of the Horned Owl which she had noted to be abnormal. The size of the bones could have easily been mistaken for the bones of a variety of North American as well as South American owls. She finds that the fossils resemble closest to Strix even though it is larger than either species that could be found in North America of the genus.[14] She goes into a full-depth investigation along with evidence filled with measurements and comparisons and finally comes to the conclusion that the bones found in the exhibit were of a new species, which is now named the Strix Brea. She published her findings in The Condor in 1932, naming the entry 'A New Species of Owl from the Pleistocene of Rancho La Brea, California'.[14]/nLocated in the Conkling Cavern in Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico, the remains of extinct mammals were found and were initially hypothesized to be from the Geococcyx californianus.[15] After comparing the new specimen with the bones of other Geococcyx californius from New Mexico, Arizona and Mexico, Howard observed that none of them are similar in size to the specimen. A year earlier, fossils were discovered two miles away in another cave, whose size was similar to the specimen and exemplified further the dissimilarity with the great roadrunner. Hence, Howard proposed that this specimen be classified as a new species called the Geococcyx conklingi.[15].", "1421544": "Padma Vibhushan (2006)\nFRS (1984)/nObaid Siddiqi FRS (7 January 1932\u00a0\u2013 26 July 2013) was an Indian National Research Professor and the Founder-Director of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) National Center for Biological Sciences.

He subsequently discovered folic acid as a cure for tropical sprue. He discovered methotrexate, a chemotherapy drug still used today and also used for rheumatoid arthritis, and diethylcarbamazine (DEC), the only effective drug for treating filariasis. Most of his career was spent in the United States. Despite his isolation of ATP, Subbarow did not gain tenure at Harvard University[2][3] though he would lead some of America's most important medical research during World War II. He is also credited with the first synthesis of the chemical compounds folic acid and methotrexate./nHe was born in a Telugu Brahmin family in Bhimavaram, Madras Presidency, now in West Godavari District, Andhra Pradesh in India. He passed through a traumatic period in his schooling at Rajahmundry (due to the premature death of close relatives by disease) and eventually matriculated in his third attempt from the Hindu High School, Madras. He passed the Intermediate Examination from the Presidency College and entered the Madras Medical College where his education was supported by friends and Kasturi Suryanarayana Murthy, whose daughter he later married.[citation needed]/nFollowing Gandhi's call to boycott British goods he started wearing khadi surgical dress; this incurred the displeasure of M. C. Bradfield, his surgery professor. Consequently, though he did well in his written papers, he was awarded the lesser LMS certificate and not a full MBBS degree. Subbarow tried to enter the Madras Medical Service without success. He then took up a job as Lecturer in Anatomy at Dr. Lakshmipathi's Ayurvedic College at Madras. He was fascinated by the healing powers of Ayurvedic medicines and began to engage in research to put Ayurveda on a modern footing.

He taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology while heading the sewage experiment station from 1908 to 1910, then taught at the College of the City of New York from 1910 to 1914./nHe was the youngest charter member of the Society of American Bacteriologists when that organization was founded in 1899.[3] With Samuel Cate Prescott he published the first American textbook on the elements of water bacteriology./nIn 1915 he founded the Yale Department of Public Health within the Yale Medical School, and he was professor and chairman of the Department until he retired in 1945.[4][5] (The Department became the Yale School of Public Health after accreditation was introduced in 1947.)[6] During a time dominated by discoveries in bacteriology, he emphasized a broader perspective on causation, adopting a more holistic perspective. The department under his direction was a catalyst for health reform in Connecticut.[6] He was the first director of Yale's J.B. Pierce Laboratory, serving from 1932 to 1957. Winslow was also instrumental in founding the Yale School of Nursing./nHe was the first Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Bacteriology, serving in that position from 1916 to 1944.[2] He was also the editor of the American Journal of Public Health from 1944 to 1954.[3] He was the curator of public health at the American Museum of Natural History from 1910 to 1922. In 1926 he became president of the American Public Health Association,[3] and in the 1950s was a consultant to the World Health Organization./nIn 1920, Winslow published a widely-cited definition of public health in Science, describing the field as \"the science and the art of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting physical health and efficiency through organized community efforts for the sanitation of the environment, the control of community infections, the education of the individual in principles of personal hygiene, the organization of medical and nursing service for the early diagnosis and preventive treatment of disease, and the development of the social machinery which will ensure to every individual in the community a standard of living adequate for the maintenance of health.

Mendel was born in a German-speaking family in the Silesian part of the Austrian Empire (today's Czech Republic) and gained posthumous recognition as the founder of the modern science of genetics.[5] Though farmers had known for millennia that crossbreeding of animals and plants could favor certain desirable traits, Mendel's pea plant experiments conducted between 1856 and 1863 established many of the rules of heredity, now referred to as the laws of Mendelian inheritance.[6]/nMendel worked with seven characteristics of pea plants: plant height, pod shape and color, seed shape and color, and flower position and color. Taking seed color as an example, Mendel showed that when a true-breeding yellow pea and a true-breeding green pea were cross-bred their offspring always produced yellow seeds. However, in the next generation, the green peas reappeared at a ratio of 1 green to 3 yellow. To explain this phenomenon, Mendel coined the terms \"recessive\" and \"dominant\" in reference to certain traits. In the preceding example, the green trait, which seems to have vanished in the first filial generation, is recessive and the yellow is dominant. He published his work in 1866, demonstrating the actions of invisible \"factors\"\u2014now called genes\u2014in predictably determining the traits of an organism./nThe profound significance of Mendel's work was not recognized until the turn of the 20th century (more than three decades later) with the rediscovery of his laws. Erich von Tschermak, Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns independently verified several of Mendel's experimental findings in 1900, ushering in the modern age of genetics.[7][8]/nMendel was born into a German-speaking family in Heinzendorf bei Odrau (called Hyn\u010dice in Czech),[2] at the Moravian-Silesian border, Austrian Empire (now Czechia).[5] He was the son of Anton and Rosine (Schwirtlich) Mendel and had one older sister, Veronika, and one younger, Theresia. They lived and worked on a farm which had been owned by the Mendel family for at least 130 years[9] (the house where Mendel was born is now a museum devoted to Mendel).[10] During his childhood, Mendel worked as a gardener and studied beekeeping. As a young man, he attended gymnasium in Troppau (Czech: Opava). He had to take four months off during his gymnasium studies due to illness.[11] From 1840 to 1843, he studied practical and theoretical philosophy and physics at the Philosophical Institute of the University of Olomouc (German: Olm\u00fctz), taking another year off because of illness. He also struggled financially to pay for his studies, and Theresia gave him her dowry. Later he helped support her three sons, two of whom became doctors.[12]/nHe became a monk in part because it enabled him to obtain an education without having to pay for it himself.[13] As the son of a struggling farmer, the monastic life, in his words, spared him the \"perpetual anxiety about a means of livelihood.\"[14] Born Johann Mendel, he was given the name Gregor (\u0158eho\u0159 in Czech)[2] when he joined the Order of Saint Augustine.[15]/nWhen Mendel entered the Faculty of Philosophy, the Department of Natural History and Agriculture was headed by Johann Karl Nestler who conducted extensive research of hereditary traits of plants and animals, especially sheep. Upon recommendation of his physics teacher Friedrich Franz,[16] Mendel entered the Augustinian St Thomas's Abbey in Brno and began his training as a priest. Mendel worked as a substitute high school teacher. In 1850, he failed the oral part, the last of three parts, of his exams to become a certified high school teacher. In 1851, he was sent to the University of Vienna to study under the sponsorship of Abbot Cyril Franti\u0161ek Napp so that he could get more formal education.[15] At Vienna, his professor of physics was Christian Doppler.[17] Mendel returned to his abbey in 1853 as a teacher, principally of physics. In 1854 he met Aleksander Zawadzki who encouraged his research in Brno. In 1856, he took the exam to become a certified teacher and again failed the oral part.[18] In 1867, he replaced Napp as abbot of the monastery.[19]/nAfter he was elevated as abbot in 1868, his scientific work largely ended, as Mendel became overburdened with administrative responsibilities, especially a dispute with the civil government over its attempt to impose special taxes on religious institutions.[20] Mendel died on 6 January 1884, at the age of 61, in Brno,[2] from chronic nephritis. Czech composer Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek played the organ at his funeral. After his death, the succeeding abbot burned all papers in Mendel's collection, to mark an end to the disputes over taxation.[21] The exhumation of Mendel's corpse in 2021 delivered some physiognomic details like body height (168\u00a0cm (66\u00a0in)). His genome was analysed, revealing that Mendel was predisposed to heart problems.[22]/nMendel, known as the \"father of modern genetics\", chose to study variation in plants in his monastery's 2 hectares (4.9 acres) experimental garden.[23] Mendel was assisted in his experimental design by Aleksander Zawadzki while his superior abbot Napp wrote to discourage him, saying that the Bishop giggled when informed of the detailed genealogies of peas.[24]/nAfter initial experiments with pea plants, Mendel settled on studying seven traits that seemed to be inherited independently of other traits: seed shape, flower color, seed coat tint, pod shape, unripe pod color, flower location, and plant height. He first focused on seed shape, which was either angular or round.[25] Between 1856 and 1863 Mendel cultivated and tested some 28,000 plants, the majority of which were pea plants (Pisum sativum).[26][27][28] This study showed that, when true-breeding different varieties were crossed to each other (e.g., tall plants fertilized by short plants), in the second generation, one in four pea plants had purebred recessive traits, two out of four were hybrids, and one out of four were purebred dominant. His experiments led him to make two generalizations, the Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent Assortment, which later came to be known as Mendel's Laws of Inheritance.[29]/nMendel presented his paper, Versuche \u00fcber Pflanzenhybriden (\"Experiments on Plant Hybridization\"), at two meetings of the Natural History Society of Brno in Moravia on 8 February and 8 March 1865.[30] It generated a few favorable reports in local newspapers,[28] but was ignored by the scientific community. When Mendel's paper was published in 1866 in Verhandlungen des naturforschenden Vereines in Br\u00fcnn,[31] it was seen as essentially about hybridization rather than inheritance, had little impact, and was cited only about three times over the next thirty-five years. His paper was criticized at the time, but is now considered a seminal work.[32] Notably, Charles Darwin was not aware of Mendel's paper, and it is envisaged that if he had been aware of it, genetics as it exists now might have taken hold much earlier.[33][34] Mendel's scientific biography thus provides an example of the failure of obscure, highly original innovators to receive the attention they deserve.[35]/nAbout forty scientists listened to Mendel's two groundbreaking lectures, but it would appear that they failed to understand the implications of his work. Later, he also carried on a correspondence with Carl N\u00e4geli, one of the leading biologists of the time, but N\u00e4geli too failed to appreciate Mendel's discoveries. At times, Mendel must have entertained doubts about his work, but not always: \"My time will come,\" he reportedly told a friend,[14] Gustav von Niessl.[36]/nDuring Mendel's lifetime, most biologists held the idea that all characteristics were passed to the next generation through blending inheritance (indeed, many effectively are), in which the traits from each parent are averaged.[37][38] Instances of this phenomenon are now explained by the action of multiple genes with quantitative effects. Charles Darwin tried unsuccessfully to explain inheritance through a theory of pangenesis. It was not until the early 20th century that the importance of Mendel's ideas was realized.[28]/nBy 1900, research aimed at finding a successful theory of discontinuous inheritance rather than blending inheritance led to independent duplication of his work by Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns, and the rediscovery of Mendel's writings and laws. Both acknowledged Mendel's priority, and it is thought probable that de Vries did not understand the results he had found until after reading Mendel.[28] Though Erich von Tschermak was originally also credited with rediscovery, this is no longer accepted because he did not understand Mendel's laws.[39] Though de Vries later lost interest in Mendelism, other biologists started to establish modern genetics as a science. All three of these researchers, each from a different country, published their rediscovery of Mendel's work within a two-month span in the spring of 1900.[40]/nMendel's results were quickly replicated, and genetic linkage quickly worked out. Biologists flocked to the theory; even though it was not yet applicable to many phenomena, it sought to give a genotypic understanding of heredity which they felt was lacking in previous studies of heredity, which had focused on phenotypic approaches.[41] Most prominent of these previous approaches was the biometric school of Karl Pearson and W. F. R. Weldon, which was based heavily on statistical studies of phenotype variation. The strongest opposition to this school came from William Bateson, who perhaps did the most in the early days of publicising the benefits of Mendel's theory (the word \"genetics\", and much of the discipline's other terminology, originated with Bateson). This debate between the biometricians and the Mendelians was extremely vigorous in the first two decades of the 20th century, with the biometricians claiming statistical and mathematical rigor,[42] whereas the Mendelians claimed a better understanding of biology.[43][44] Modern genetics shows that Mendelian heredity is in fact an inherently biological process, though not all genes of Mendel's experiments are yet understood.[45][46]/nIn the end, the two approaches were combined, especially by work conducted by R. A. Fisher as early as 1918. The combination, in the 1930s and 1940s, of Mendelian genetics with Darwin's theory of natural selection resulted in the modern synthesis of evolutionary biology.[47][48]/nIn the Soviet Union and China, Mendelian genetics was rejected in favor of Lamarckism, leading to imprisonment and even execution of Mendelian geneticists (see Lysenkoism)./nMendel began his studies on heredity using mice. He was at St. Thomas's Abbey but his bishop did not like one of his friars studying animal sex, so Mendel switched to plants.[49] Mendel also bred bees in a bee house that was built for him, using bee hives that he designed.[50][51] He also studied astronomy and meteorology,[19] founding the 'Austrian Meteorological Society' in 1865.[17] The majority of his published works were related to meteorology.[17]/nMendel also experimented with hawkweed (Hieracium)[52] and honeybees. He published a report on his work with hawkweed,[53] a group of plants of great interest to scientists at the time because of their diversity. However, the results of Mendel's inheritance study in hawkweeds was unlike his results for peas; the first generation was very variable and many of their offspring were identical to the maternal parent. In his correspondence with Carl N\u00e4geli he discussed his results but was unable to explain them.[52] It was not appreciated until the end of the nineteenth century that many hawkweed species were apomictic, producing most of their seeds through an asexual process.[36][54]/nNone of his results on bees survived, except for a passing mention in the reports of Moravian Apiculture Society.[55] All that is known definitely is that he used Cyprian and Carniolan bees,[56] which were particularly aggressive to the annoyance of other monks and visitors of the monastery such that he was asked to get rid of them.[57] Mendel, on the other hand, was fond of his bees, and referred to them as \"my dearest little animals\".[58]/nHe also described novel plant species, and these are denoted with the botanical author abbreviation \"Mendel\".[59]/nIn 1936, Ronald Fisher, a prominent statistician and population geneticist, reconstructed Mendel's experiments, analyzed results from the F2 (second filial) generation and found the ratio of dominant to recessive phenotypes (e.g. yellow versus green peas; round versus wrinkled peas) to be implausibly and consistently too close to the expected ratio of 3 to 1.[60][61][62] Fisher asserted that \"the data of most, if not all, of the experiments have been falsified so as to agree closely with Mendel's expectations\".[60] Mendel's alleged observations, according to Fisher, were \"abominable\", \"shocking\",[63] and \"cooked\".[64]/nOther scholars agree with Fisher that Mendel's various observations come uncomfortably close to Mendel's expectations. A. W. F. Edwards,[65] for instance, remarks: \"One can applaud the lucky gambler; but when he is lucky again tomorrow, and the next day, and the following day, one is entitled to become a little suspicious\". Three other lines of evidence likewise lend support to the assertion that Mendel's results are indeed too good to be true.[66]/nFisher's analysis gave rise to the Mendelian paradox: Mendel's reported data are, statistically speaking, too good to be true, yet \"everything we know about Mendel suggests that he was unlikely to engage in either deliberate fraud or in unconscious adjustment of his observations\".[66] A number of writers have attempted to resolve this paradox./nOne attempted explanation invokes confirmation bias.[67] Fisher accused Mendel's experiments as \"biased strongly in the direction of agreement with expectation\u00a0[...] to give the theory the benefit of doubt\".[60] In a 2004 article, J.W. Porteous concluded that Mendel's observations were indeed implausible.[68] An explanation for Mendel's results based on tetrad pollen has been proposed, but reproduction of the experiments showed no evidence that the tetrad-pollen model explains any of the bias.[69]/nAnother attempt[66] to resolve the Mendelian paradox notes that a conflict may sometimes arise between the moral imperative of a bias-free recounting of one's factual observations and the even more important imperative of advancing scientific knowledge. Mendel might have felt compelled \"to simplify his data in order to meet real, or feared, editorial objections\".[65] Such an action could be justified on moral grounds (and hence provide a resolution to the Mendelian paradox), since the alternative\u2014refusing to comply\u2014might have retarded the growth of scientific knowledge. Similarly, like so many other obscure innovators of science,[35] Mendel, a little known innovator of working-class background, had to \"break through the cognitive paradigms and social prejudices\" of his audience.[65] If such a breakthrough \"could be best achieved by deliberately omitting some observations from his report and adjusting others to make them more palatable to his audience, such actions could be justified on moral grounds\".[66]/nDaniel L. Hartl and Daniel J. Fairbanks reject outright Fisher's statistical argument, suggesting that Fisher incorrectly interpreted Mendel's experiments. They find it likely that Mendel scored more than 10 progeny, and that the results matched the expectation. They conclude: \"Fisher's allegation of deliberate falsification can finally be put to rest, because on closer analysis it has proved to be unsupported by convincing evidence\".[63][70] In 2008 Hartl and Fairbanks (with Allan Franklin and AWF Edwards) wrote a comprehensive book in which they concluded that there were no reasons to assert Mendel fabricated his results, nor that Fisher deliberately tried to diminish Mendel's legacy.[71] Reassessment of Fisher's statistical analysis, according to these authors, also disproves the notion of confirmation bias in Mendel's results.[72][73]/nMount Mendel in New Zealand's Paparoa Range was named after him in 1970 by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.[74] In celebration of his 200th birthday, Mendel's body was exhumed and his DNA sequenced.[75]", "55161112": "Agnieszka Koz\u0142owska-Rajewicz (born 4 December 1969) is a Polish politician and biology academic, who served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) during the eighth term from 2014 till 2019 representing Greater Poland.

Goodall first went to Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania to observe its chimpanzees in 1960.[5]/nShe is the founder of the Jane Goodall Institute and the Roots & Shoots programme, and she has worked extensively on conservation and animal welfare issues. As of 2022, she is on the board of the Nonhuman Rights Project.[6] In April 2002, she was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace. Goodall is an honorary member of the World Future Council./nValerie Jane Morris-Goodall was born in April 1934 in Hampstead, London,[7] to businessman Mortimer Herbert Morris-Goodall (1907\u20132001) and Margaret Myfanwe Joseph (1906\u20132000),[8] a novelist from Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire,[9] who wrote under the name Vanne Morris-Goodall.[3]/nThe family later moved to Bournemouth, and Goodall attended Uplands School, an independent school in nearby Poole.[3]/nAs a child, Goodall's father gave her a stuffed toy chimpanzee named Jubilee as an alternative to a teddy bear. Goodall has said her fondness for it sparked her early love of animals, commenting, \"My mother's friends were horrified by this toy, thinking it would frighten me and give me nightmares.\" Jubilee still sits on Goodall's dresser in London.[10]/nGoodall had always been drawn to animals and Africa, which brought her to the farm of a friend in the Kenya highlands in 1957.[11] From there, she obtained work as a secretary, and acting on her friend's advice, she telephoned Louis Leakey,[12] the Kenyan archaeologist and palaeontologist, with no other thought than to make an appointment to discuss animals. Leakey, believing that the study of existing great apes could provide indications of the behaviour of early hominids,[13] was looking for a chimpanzee researcher, though he kept the idea to himself. Instead, he proposed that Goodall work for him as a secretary. After obtaining approval from his co-researcher and wife, British paleoanthropologist Mary Leakey, Louis sent Goodall to Olduvai Gorge in Tanganyika (modern Tanzania), where he laid out his plans.[14]/nIn 1958, Leakey sent Goodall to London to study primate behaviour with Osman Hill and primate anatomy with John Napier.[15] Leakey raised funds, and on 14 July 1960, Goodall went to Gombe Stream National Park, becoming the first of what would come to be called The Trimates.[16] She was accompanied by her mother, whose presence was necessary to satisfy the requirements of David Anstey, chief warden, who was concerned for their safety.[11] Goodall credits her mother with encouraging her to pursue a career in primatology, a male-dominated field at the time. Goodall has stated that women were not accepted in the field when she started her research in the late 1950s.[17] As of 2019[update], the field of primatology is made up almost evenly of men and women, in part thanks to the trailblazing of Goodall and her encouragement of young women to join the field.[18]/nLeakey arranged funding, and in 1962 he sent Goodall, who had no degree, to the University of Cambridge.[14] She was the eighth person to be allowed to study for a PhD at Cambridge without first having obtained a bachelor's degree.[3][19][20] She went to Newnham College, Cambridge, where she received her Bachelor of Arts in natural sciences by 1964, which is when she went up to the new Darwin College, Cambridge, for a Doctor of Philosophy in ethology.[21][1][11][22][23] Her thesis was completed in 1966 under the supervision of Robert Hinde on the Behaviour of free-living chimpanzees,[1] detailing her first five years of study at the Gombe Reserve.[3][22]/nOn 19 June 2006, the Open University of Tanzania awarded her an honorary Doctor of Science degree./nGoodall studied chimpanzee social and family life beginning with the Kasakela chimpanzee community in Gombe Stream National Park, Tanzania, in 1960.[24][25] She found that \"it isn't only human beings who have personality, who are capable of rational thought [and] emotions like joy and sorrow.\"[25] She also observed behaviours such as hugs, kisses, pats on the back, and even tickling, what we consider \"human\" actions.[25] Goodall insists that these gestures are evidence of \"the close, supportive, affectionate bonds that develop between family members and other individuals within a community, which can persist throughout a life span of more than 50 years.\"[25]/nGoodall's research at Gombe Stream challenged two long-standing beliefs of the day: that only humans could construct and use tools, and that chimpanzees were vegetarians.[25] While observing one chimpanzee feeding at a termite mound, she watched him repeatedly place stalks of grass into termite holes, then remove them from the hole covered with clinging termites, effectively \"fishing\" for termites.[26] The chimpanzees would also take twigs from trees and strip off the leaves to make the twig more effective, a form of object modification that is the rudimentary beginnings of toolmaking.[26] Humans had long distinguished themselves from the rest of the animal kingdom as \"Man the Toolmaker\". In response to Goodall's revolutionary findings, Louis Leakey wrote, \"We must now redefine man, redefine tool, or accept chimpanzees as human!\"[26][27][28]/nIn contrast to the peaceful and affectionate behaviours she observed, Goodall also found an aggressive side of chimpanzee nature at Gombe Stream. She discovered that chimpanzees will systematically hunt and eat smaller primates such as colobus monkeys.[25] Goodall watched a hunting group isolate a colobus monkey high in a tree and block all possible exits; then one chimpanzee climbed up and captured and killed the colobus.[28] The others then each took parts of the carcass, sharing with other members of the troop in response to begging behaviours.[28] The chimpanzees at Gombe kill and eat as much as one-third of the colobus population in the park each year.[25] This alone was a major scientific find that challenged previous conceptions of chimpanzee diet and behaviour.[citation needed][29]/nGoodall also observed the tendency for aggression and violence within chimpanzee troops. Goodall observed dominant females deliberately killing the young of other females in the troop to maintain their dominance,[25] sometimes going as far as cannibalism.[26] She says of this revelation, \"During the first ten years of the study I had believed [...] that the Gombe chimpanzees were, for the most part, rather nicer than human beings. [...] Then suddenly we found that chimpanzees could be brutal\u2014that they, like us, had a darker side to their nature.\"[26] She described the 1974\u20131978 Gombe Chimpanzee War in her 1990 memoir, Through a Window: My Thirty Years with the Chimpanzees of Gombe. Her findings revolutionised contemporary knowledge of chimpanzee behaviour and were further evidence of the social similarities between humans and chimpanzees, albeit in a much darker manner.[citation needed]/nGoodall set herself apart from convention by naming the animals in her studies of primates instead of assigning each a number. Numbering was a nearly universal practice at the time and was thought to be important in the removal of oneself from the potential for emotional attachment to the subject being studied. Setting herself apart from other researchers also led her to develop a close bond with the chimpanzees and to become the only human ever accepted into chimpanzee society. She was the lowest-ranking member of a troop for a period of 22 months. Among those whom Goodall named during her years in Gombe were:[30]/nIn 1977, Goodall established the Jane Goodall Institute (JGI), which supports the Gombe research, and she is a global leader in the effort to protect chimpanzees and their habitats. With nineteen offices around the world, the JGI is widely recognised for community-centred conservation and development programs in Africa. Its global youth program, Roots & Shoots, began in 1991 when a group of 16 local teenagers met with Goodall on her back porch in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. They were eager to discuss a range of problems they knew about from first-hand experience that caused them deep concern. The organisation has over 10,000 groups in over 100 countries as of 2010[update].[35]/nIn 1992, Goodall founded the Tchimpounga Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Centre in the Republic of Congo to care for chimpanzees orphaned due to bush-meat trade. The rehabilitation houses over a hundred chimps over its three islands.[36]/nIn 1994, Goodall founded the Lake Tanganyika Catchment Reforestation and Education (TACARE or \"Take Care\") pilot project to protect chimpanzees' habitat from deforestation by reforesting hills around Gombe while simultaneously educating neighbouring communities on sustainability and agriculture training. The TACARE project also supports young girls by offering them access to reproductive health education and through scholarships to finance their college tuition.[37]/nOwing to an overflow of handwritten notes, photographs, and data piling up at Jane's home in Dar es Salaam in the mid-1990s, the Jane Goodall Institute's Center for Primate Studies was created at the University of Minnesota to house and organise this data. As of 2011[update] all of the original Jane Goodall archives reside there and have been digitised, analysed, and placed in an online database.[38] On 17 March 2011, Duke University spokesman Karl Bates announced that the archives will move to Duke, with Anne E. Pusey, Duke's chairman of evolutionary anthropology, overseeing the collection. Pusey, who managed the archives in Minnesota and worked with Goodall in Tanzania, had worked at Duke for a year.[39]/nIn 2018 and 2020, Goodall partnered with friend and CEO Michael Cammarata on two natural product lines from Schmidt's Naturals and Neptune Wellness Solutions. Five percent of every sale benefited the Jane Goodall Institute.[40][41][42]/nAs of 2004, Goodall devotes virtually all of her time to advocacy on behalf of chimpanzees and the environment, travelling nearly 300 days a year.[43][44] Goodall is also on the advisory council for the world's largest chimpanzee sanctuary outside of Africa, Save the Chimps in Fort Pierce, Florida.[45]/nJane Goodall is an advisory board member for The Society for the Protection of Underground Networks (SPUN)./nGoodall credits the 1986 Understanding Chimpanzees conference, hosted by the Chicago Academy of Sciences, with shifting her focus from observation of chimpanzees to a broader and more intense concern with animal-human conservation.[46] She is the former president of Advocates for Animals,[47] an organisation based in Edinburgh, Scotland, that campaigns against the use of animals in medical research, zoos, farming and sport.[citation needed][48] She is a vegetarian and advocates the diet for ethical, environmental, and health reasons. In The Inner World of Farm Animals (2009), Goodall writes that farm animals are \"far more aware and intelligent than we ever imagined and, despite having been bred as domestic slaves, they are individual beings in their own right. As such, they deserve our respect. And our help. Who will plead for them if we are silent?\"[49] Goodall has also said: \"Thousands of people who say they 'love' animals sit down once or twice a day to enjoy the flesh of creatures who have been treated so with little respect and kindness just to make more meat.\"[50] In 2021, Goodall became a vegan and authored a cookbook titled Eat Meat Less.[51]/nGoodall is an outspoken environmental advocate, speaking on the effects of climate change on endangered species such as chimpanzees. Goodall, alongside her foundation, collaborated with NASA to use satellite imagery from the Landsat series to remedy the effects of deforestation on chimpanzees and local communities in Western Africa by offering the villagers information on how to reduce activity and preserve their environment.[52] To ensure the safe and ethical treatment of animals during ethological studies, Goodall, alongside Professor Mark Bekoff, founded the organization Ethologists for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in 2000.[53]/nIn 2008, Goodall gave a lecture entitled \"Reason for Hope\" at the University of San Diego's Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace & Justice,[54] and in the same year demanded the European Union end the use of medical research on animals and ensure more funding for alternative methods of medical research.[55] She controversially described Edinburgh Zoo's new primate enclosure as a \"wonderful facility\" where monkeys \"are probably better off [than those] living in the wild in an area like Budongo, where one in six gets caught in a wire snare, and countries like Congo, where chimpanzees, monkeys and gorillas are shot for food commercially.\"[56] This was in conflict with Advocates for Animals' position on captive animals.[57] In June that year, she resigned the presidency of the organisation which she had held since 1998, citing her busy schedule and explaining, \"I just don't have time for them.\"[58] Goodall is a patron of the population concern charity Population Matters[59] and as of 2017[update] is an ambassador for Disneynature.[60]/nIn 2010, Goodall, through JGI, formed a coalition with a number of organizations such as the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) and petitioned to list all chimpanzees, including those that are captive, as endangered.[61] In 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) announced that they would accept this rule and that all chimpanzees would be classified as endangered.[62] In 2011, she became a patron of the Australian animal protection group Voiceless. \"I have for decades been concerned about factory farming, in part because of the tremendous harm inflicted on the environment, but also because of the shocking ongoing cruelty perpetuated on millions of sentient beings.\"[63] In 2012, she took on the role of challenger for the Engage in Conservation Challenge with The DO School, formerly known as the D&F Academy.[64] She worked with a group of aspiring social entrepreneurs to create a workshop to engage young people in conserving biodiversity, and to tackle a perceived global lack of awareness of the issue.[65] In 2014, Goodall wrote to Air France executives, criticizing the airline's continued transport of monkeys to laboratories. Goodall called the practice \"cruel\" and \"traumatic\" for the monkeys involved. The same year, Goodall also wrote to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to criticize maternal deprivation experiments on baby monkeys in NIH laboratories.[66][67]/nPrior to the 2015 UK general election, she endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party's Caroline Lucas.[68] She is a critic of fox hunting and signed a letter to Members of Parliament in 2015 opposing the Conservative prime minister David Cameron's plan to amend the Hunting Act 2004.[69]/nIn August 2019, Goodall was honoured for her contributions to science with a bronze sculpture in Midtown Manhattan alongside nine other women, part of the \"Statues for Equality\" project.[70] In 2020 she advocated for ecocide (mass damage or destruction of nature) to be made an international crime, stating \u201cThe concept of Ecocide is long overdue. It could lead to an important change in the way people perceive \u2013 and respond to \u2013 the current environmental crisis.\u201d[71][72][73] That same year, Goodall vowed to plant 5 million trees, part of the 1 trillion tree initiative founded by the World Economic Forum.[74] In 2021, Goodall called on the EU Commission to abolish caging of farm animals.[75]/nIn 2021, Goodall joined the Rewriting Extinction campaign to fight the climate and biodiversity crisis through comics. She is listed as a contributor to the book The Most Important Comic Book on Earth: Stories to Save the World[76] which was released on 28 October 2021 by DK.[77]/nGoodall has married twice. On 28 March 1964, she married a Dutch nobleman, wildlife photographer Baron Hugo van Lawick, at Chelsea Old Church, London, and became known during their marriage as Baroness Jane van Lawick-Goodall.[78] The couple had a son, Hugo Eric Louis (born 1967); they divorced in 1974. The following year, she married Derek Bryceson, a member of Tanzania's parliament and the director of that country's national parks. Bryceson died of cancer in October 1980.[79] Owing to his position in the Tanzanian government as head of the country's national park system, Bryceson could protect Goodall's research project and implement an embargo on tourism at Gombe.[79]/nGoodall has stated that dogs are her favourite animal.[80]/nGoodall has prosopagnosia, which makes it difficult to recognize familiar faces.[81]/nGoodall was raised in a Christian congregationalist family. As a young woman, she took night classes in Theosophy. Her family were occasional churchgoers, but Goodall began attending more regularly as a teenager when the church appointed a new minister, Trevor Davies. \"He was highly intelligent and his sermons were powerful and thought-provoking... I could have listened to his voice for hours... I fell madly in love with him... Suddenly, no one had to encourage me to go to church. Indeed, there were never enough services for my liking.\" Of her later discovery of the atheism and agnosticism of many of her scientific colleagues, Goodall wrote that \"[f]ortunately, by the time I got to Cambridge I was twenty-seven years old and my beliefs had already moulded so that I was not influenced by these opinions.\"[82]/nIn her 1999 book Reason for Hope: A Spiritual Journey, Goodall describes the implications of a mystical experience she had at Notre Dame Cathedral in 1977: \"Since I cannot believe that this was the result of chance, I have to admit anti-chance. And so I must believe in a guiding power in the universe \u2013 in other words, I must believe in God.\"[83] When asked if she believes in God, Goodall said in September 2010: \"I don't have any idea of who or what God is. But I do believe in some great spiritual power. I feel it particularly when I'm out in nature. It's just something that's bigger and stronger than what I am or what anybody is. I feel it. And it's enough for me.\"[84] When asked in the same year if she still considers herself a Christian, Goodall told the Guardian \"I suppose so; I was raised as a Christian.\" and stated that she saw no contradiction between evolution and belief in God.[85]/nIn her foreword to the 2017 book The Intelligence of the Cosmos by Ervin Laszlo, a philosopher of science who advocates quantum consciousness theory, Goodall wrote: \"we must accept that there is an Intelligence driving the process [of evolution], that the Universe and life on Earth are inspired and in-formed by an unknown and unknowable Creator, a Supreme Being, a Great Spiritual Power.\"[86]/nGoodall used unconventional practices in her study; for example, naming individuals instead of numbering them. At the time, numbering was used to prevent emotional attachment and loss of objectivity.[87][88]/nGoodall wrote in 1993: \"When, in the early 1960s, I brazenly used such words as 'childhood', 'adolescence', 'motivation', 'excitement', and 'mood' I was much criticised. Even worse was my crime of suggesting that chimpanzees had 'personalities'. I was ascribing human characteristics to nonhuman animals and was thus guilty of that worst of ethological sins\u2014anthropomorphism.\"[89]/nMany standard methods aim to avoid interference by observers, and in particular some believe that the use of feeding stations to attract Gombe chimpanzees has altered normal foraging and feeding patterns and social relationships. This argument is the focus of a book published by Margaret Power in 1991.[90] It has been suggested that higher levels of aggression and conflict with other chimpanzee groups in the area were due to the feeding, which could have created the \"wars\" between chimpanzee social groups described by Goodall, aspects of which she did not witness in the years before artificial feeding began at Gombe. Thus, some regard Goodall's observations as distortions of normal chimpanzee behaviour.[91]/nGoodall herself acknowledged that feeding contributed to aggression within and between groups, but maintained that the effect was limited to alteration of the intensity and not the nature of chimpanzee conflict, and further suggested that feeding was necessary for the study to be effective at all. Craig Stanford of the Jane Goodall Research Institute at the University of Southern California states that researchers conducting studies with no artificial provisioning have a difficult time viewing any social behaviour of chimpanzees, especially those related to inter-group conflict.[92]/nSome recent studies, such as those by Crickette Sanz in the Goualougo Triangle (Congo) and Christophe Boesch in the Ta\u00ef National Park (Ivory Coast), have not shown the aggression observed in the Gombe studies.[93] However, other primatologists disagree that the studies are flawed; for example, Jim Moore provides a critique of Margaret Powers' assertions[94] and some studies of other chimpanzee groups have shown aggression similar to that in Gombe even in the absence of feeding.[95]/nOn 22 March 2013, Hachette Book Group announced that Goodall's and co-author Gail Hudson's new book, Seeds of Hope, would not be released on 2 April as planned due to the discovery of plagiarised portions.[96] A reviewer for The Washington Post found unattributed sections that were copied from websites about organic tea, tobacco, and an \"amateurish astrology site\", as well as from Wikipedia.[97] Goodall apologised and stated, \"It is important to me that the proper sources are credited, and I will be working diligently with my team to address all areas of concern. My goal is to ensure that when this book is released it is not only up to the highest of standards, but also that the focus be on the crucial messages it conveys.\"[98] The book was released on 1 April 2014, after review and the addition of 57 pages of endnotes.[99]/nOne of Gary Larson's Far Side cartoons shows two chimpanzees grooming. One finds a blonde human hair on the other and inquires, \"Conducting a little more 'research' with that Jane Goodall tramp?\"[100] Goodall herself was in Africa at the time, and the Jane Goodall Institute thought this was in bad taste and had its lawyers draft a letter to Larson and his distribution syndicate in which they described the cartoon as an \"atrocity\". They were stymied by Goodall herself: when she returned and saw the cartoon, she stated that she found the cartoon amusing.[101]/nSince then, all profits from sales of a shirt featuring this cartoon have gone to the Jane Goodall Institute. Goodall wrote a preface to The Far Side Gallery 5, detailing her version of the controversy, and the institute's letter was included next to the cartoon in the complete Far Side collection.[102] She praised Larson's creative ideas, which often compare and contrast the behaviour of humans and animals. In 1988, when Larson visited Goodall's research facility in Tanzania,[101] he was attacked by a chimpanzee named Frodo.[100]/nOn 3 March 2022, in celebration of Women's History Month and International Women's Day, The Lego Group issued set number 40530, A Jane Goodall Tribute, depicting a Jane Goodall minifigure and three chimpanzees in an African forest scene.[103]/nOn 31 December 2021, Goodall was the guest editor of the BBC Radio Four Today programme.

He has co-founded commercial concerns spanning these areas, and others from green and natural products chemistry to infectious agent testing and fuel production, including Knome, LS9, and Joule Unlimited (respectively, human genomics, green chemistry, and solar fuel companies)./nWith Walter Gilbert, Church published the first direct genomic sequencing method in 1984.[47][48] Described in that publication were the cyclic application of fluids to a solid phase alternating with imaging, plus avoidance of bacterial cloning, strategies that are still used in current dominant Next-Generation Sequencing technologies. These technologies began to affect genome-scale sequencing in 2005.[49] Church also helped initiate the Human Genome Project in 1984.[50] He invented the broadly applied concepts of molecular multiplexing and barcode tags,[51] and his genome was the fifth whole human genome ever sequenced. Church was the first person to make his medical records and genome publicly available to researchers.[52] Technology transfer of automated sequencing and software from his Harvard laboratory to Genome Therapeutics Corp. resulted in the first bacterial genome sequence and first commercial genome (the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori) in 1994.[53] Church was co-inventor of nanopore sequencing in 1995,[54] which is now commercially available (e.g. Oxford Nanopore Technologies), but not in the form embodied in Church's contribution to the original patents.[55]/nTo aid in the interpretation and sharing of genomes, Church initiated the Personal Genome Project (PGP) in 2005,[56] providing the world's only open-access human genome and trait data sets.[57][58][59] Eight trios (mother, father, and child) from the Personal Genome Project are in the process of being chosen to act as the primary genome standards (reference materials) for the NIST+FDA genomeinabottle.org program.[60]/nChurch furthermore announced his intention to publish his DNA via NFT and use the profits made through its sale to finance research conducted by Nebula Genomics. In June 2022 20 NFTs with his likeness were published instead of the originally planned NFTs of his DNA due to the market conditions at the time.[61] Despite leading to mixed reactions the project is considered to be part of an effort to use the genetic data of 15,000 individuals to support genetic research.

In one such proposed method, enzymatically produced DNA would serve as a \"ticker tape record\" of neuronal activity.[71][73]/nChurch worked on engineered adeno-associated viral vectors to evade innate immune and inflammatory responses. The research was published in Science Translational Medicine in 2021 and showed the possibility of a less immunogenic gene therapy with the new TLR9-edited Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) as a safer viral vector.[74] Based on the research, Church and a postdoc from his lab who was also the first-author of the research, co-founded Ally Therapeutics.[75][76] In 2017, the Church lab at Harvard created adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based single combination gene therapy \"for simultaneous treatment of several age-related diseases\", detailing the technology's efficacy in mitigating obesity, type II diabetes, heart failure, and renal failure in mice, and the work was published in PNAS.[77] In early 2018,[78] Rejuvenate Bio was launched from the Church lab at the Wyss Institute at Harvard to prevent and treat several age-related diseases in dogs, extending their overall lifespan.[79] In the February 2020, Rejuvenate Bio, the company co-founded by Church, received an exclusive worldwide license from the Harvard Office of Technology Development to commercialise their gene therapy technology.[80][81] As the co-founder of Rejuvenate Bio in an interview Church said,/nScience hasn't yet found a way to make complex animals like dogs live forever, so the next best thing we can do is find a way to maintain health for as long as possible during the aging process.[82]/nChurch is a faculty member in the Consortium of Space Genetics at Harvard Medical School.[83]/nIn March 2015, Church and his genetics research team at Harvard successfully copied some woolly mammoth genes into the genome of an Asian elephant. Using the CRISPR DNA editing technique, his group spliced genetic segments from frozen mammoth specimens, including genes from the ears, subcutaneous fat, and hair attributes, into the DNA of skin cells from a modern elephant. National Geographic, in an article titled \"Mammoth-elephant hybrids could be created within the decade. Should they be?\", reported,/nChurch's dreams of engineering a hybrid mammoth first deepened after an interview he did with the New York Times in 2008 about efforts to sequence the woolly mammoth genome./nThis marked the first time that woolly mammoth genes had been functionally active since the species became extinct.[84] Their work has not been subject to peer review, however. Church stated that \"Just making a DNA change isn't that meaningful. We want to read out the phenotypes.\" To do that, the team plans to perform further tests to get the hybrid cells into becoming specialized tissues, and from there attempting to turn the hybrid elephant/mammoth skin cells into hybrid embryos that can be grown in artificial wombs.[citation needed]/nOn September 13, 2021, Church founded a biosciences and genetics company, Colossal Biosciences, with entrepreneur Ben Lamm.

She developed the concept of ganglion preparation of large identifiable nerves.[4] Arvanitaki also discovered that regular electrical oscillations could periodically grow in size until a series of action potentials were fired along isolated nerve fibres of the cuttlefish, genus Sepia.[4] A further contribution of Arvanitaki was the demonstration that a neuronal circuit was not required for a single nerve to produce rhythmic and spontaneous activity. Also, she discovered that when two nerve fibres are close in proximity, the activity of a single nerve fibre can generate activity in a nearby nerve fibre[4] a phenomenon she named ephaptic coupling.\nArvanitaki and her husband Chalazonitis both explored the methodology of electrophysiological activity of the nervous system of the sea hare genus Aplysia.[5]\nIn 1955, Arvanitaki and Chalazonitis[6] as well as Ladislav Tauc[7] created the first intracellular recordings of large neurons of the California sea hare.

The company used a combination of bioinformatics and chemoinformatics to look at the relationships between the structure and function of proteins, and the binding of chemical groups to these proteins leading to the discovery of novel drugs.[citation needed]/nTHREADER provides a method[6] is popularly known as protein fold recognition (threading), a method of protein modeling, which is used to model those proteins which have the same fold as proteins of known structures. The input is an amino acid sequence with unknown protein structure, then THREADER will output a most probable protein structure for this sequence. The degree of compatibility between the sequence and the proposed structure is evaluated by means of set of empirical potentials derived from proteins of known structures.\nThis work got preceded by David Baker and his colleagues, who have taken THREADER idea further in the form of the Rosetta method which has a huge impact in the field./nMEMSAT[7] is an approach to predict the positions of transmembrane helix segments based on the recognition of the topological models of proteins. The method uses a set of statistical tables derived from well-characterized membrane protein data, and we have a dynamic programming algorithm to recognize the membrane topology models by maximizing the expectation. Since MEMSAT was originally built back in 1994, it then triggered a lot of improvements in the prediction of secondary structure. The newest version is MEMSAT3,[8] released in 2007. It uses a neural network to determine the locations of residues are on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane or in the transmembrane helices./nJones was involved in the early stage of development of the CATH database, with Christine Orengo and Janet Thornton[9] which is a hierarchical domain classification of protein structures in the Protein Data Bank, where the 4 major levels in hierarchy are: Class, Architecture, Topology, and Homologous superfamily.

His research included DNA biochemistry and biophysics, genetics, mathematical biology, and finally dynamical systems. He devoted his life to the deciphering of key logical principles at the basis of the behaviour of biological systems, and more generally to the generation of complex dynamical behaviour. He was professor and laboratory head at the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, and taught and inspired several generations of researchers./nRen\u00e9 Thomas was born on 14 May 1928, in Brussels, Belgium. His parents were the poet Lucien-Paul Thomas and Marieke Vandenbergh. He was the youngest of three siblings further including Anny and Andr\u00e9 Thomas. Ren\u00e9 Thomas was the father of three children: Isabelle, Pierre and Anne. He spent his childhood in La Hulpe, Belgium. Very young, he was already fascinated by biology and published his first scientific article at the age of 13 years old. He continued his studies at the Royal Athenaeum of Ixelles (Brussels), and at the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), where he studied chemistry./nAt ULB, Thomas attended lectures by Jean Brachet, who pioneered the field of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and their role in heredity and protein synthesis. Under Brachet's supervision, Thomas prepared and defended a PhD thesis on the denaturation of DNA in 1952.[1]/nAfter two years of postdoctoral training in the laboratories of Harriet Ephrussi (Paris, France, 1953\u20131954) and of Alfred Hershey (Cold Spring Harbour, USA, 1957\u20131958), Thomas returned to ULB in 1958, where he was appointed to lecture on Genetics. In 1961, he was appointed director of the Laboratory of Genetic of the ULB./nThomas' career was attested by a number of prestigious awards, including the Francqui prize in 1975, the five-year prize of the Belgian National Funds for Scientific Research (FNRS) in 1985 for his discoveries on DNA, genetic transformation of bacteria and bacteriophages and the Grande M\u00e9daille from the French Academy of Sciences in 1999. He was elected as a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Belgium in 1986./nIn addition to biology, Thomas had various passions, including mountain climbing, mathematics, music, and astronomy. During his youth, he spent much of his free time climbing, particularly in Freyr, high Valais, Ecrins and Dolomites. He was an amateur oboe player and a great admirer of Joseph Haydn. More recently he became deeply interested in the theory of music, particularly in musical temperaments. The reading of the writing of Lewis Carol on logics triggered his interest into more formal approaches. Likewise, his research work covered a wide range of distinct topics, all of which were driven by the same conviction that it will not be possible to understand complex systems without understanding the logic of simpler ones./nThomas discovered that the UV absorption of native DNA is far lower than expected from a \"theoretical\" spectrum built from the extinction coefficients of its component nucleotides.[2][3][4] This gap disappears after mild treatments such as lower or higher pH, higher temperature, or lower ionic strength, especially lower concentration of divalent cations. These preserve the inter-nucleotide bonds that maintain the DNA structure, implying that the nitrogenous bases, responsible for the UV absorbance, interact by weak bonds (Hydrogen bonds or Van der Waals forces), contributing a labile secondary structure to DNA. Melting this secondary structure was coined DNA denaturation,[5] by analogy with the similar process long known for proteins. Once the detailed nature of the secondary structure of DNA was elucidated by Francis Crick, James Watson, Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, DNA denaturation could be understood as the unwinding of the double helix.[6]/nIt became fundamental in all processes that use DNA amplification, e.g. DNA sequencing, molecular cloning and Polymerase Chain Reaction whether for fundamental purposes or for applications to gene therapy and judicial enquiries./nWork by Fran\u00e7ois Jacob, Andr\u00e9 Lwoff, Jacques Monod and Elie Wollman demonstrated the existence of regulatory genes that negatively control the expression of other (target) genes, which are silenced by the product of the regulatory gene, the repressor. Contrary to the general assumption at the time that all genetic regulations would be negative, Thomas showed that genetic regulation can also be positive, i.e., that the products of some regulatory genes can directly activate target genes./nThe experiments that led to this discovery involved bacteria and their viruses, the bacteriophages (or phages). Some bacteriophages can integrate their DNA genome in the bacterial genome, where it remains latent (a state called \"prophage\") due to the repression of all viral genes by the product of a bacteriophage regulatory gene. In this respect, Thomas demonstrated that the replication of the virus is directly blocked by the repressor (\"Thomas-Bertani effect\").[7]/nThomas further discovered that some of the genes of the prophage, even though they are negatively regulated by the prophage's repressor, can be activated after infection of the bacterium by another, closely related virus (\"superinfection\"). This demonstrated that regulatory genes can activate target genes (\"transactivation\"), despite the repression caused by a negative regulator.[8]/nThomas identified two positive regulators in phage lambda, the products of genes N and Q. He showed that these regulatory products act sequentially to activate the expression of most other lambda genes.[9]/nThe existence of positive regulation and that of regulatory cascades were later found to play essential roles in the development of all multicellular organisms, including humans. In the meantime, the complexity of lambda regulation led Thomas to initiate a logical analysis of the behaviour of genetic regulatory networks, his second major contribution to our understanding of gene regulation./nThe intricacies of the regulatory network controlling the decision between lysis and lysogeny by bacteriophage lambda led Thomas to realise that understanding phage behaviour based on the sole intuition became very difficult. He therefore looked for means to model this network and formalise its dynamical analysis. He came across Boolean algebra and its application to the design and analysis of electronic circuits. As Boolean algebra deals with variables taking only two values (0/OFF or 1/ON) and simple logical operators such as AND, OR, and NOT, it is particularly well suited to formalise the reasoning process of geneticists, e.g. statements such as \"this gene will be ON only if such regulatory factor (activator) is present and if this other factor (inhibitor) is absent\". Thomas learned how to use the Boolean formalism by attending classes of his colleague Jean Florine at the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles./nStimulated by the work of Fran\u00e7ois Jacob and Jacques Monod on bacterial gene regulation, a few other theoreticians had the idea of applying Boolean algebra to the modelling of gene networks, including Mitoyosi Sugita[10] and Stuart Kauffman.[11][12]/nWith the help of the physicist Philippe Van Ham, the chemist Jean Richelle, and the mathematician El Houssine Snoussi, Thomas then focused on the logical modelling of relatively small regulatory networks (including the one controlling bacteriophage lambda development), using a more complex asynchronous updating scheme, and considering various refinements of the logical formalism: introduction of multi-level variables, explicit consideration of threshold values, and definition of logical parameters corresponding to the kinetic parameters used in the differential formalism.[13][14][15]/nIn its present form, the logical modelling approach developed by Thomas and collaborators relies on the delineation of a \"regulatory graph\", where nodes (vertices) represent regulatory components (e.g. regulatory genes or proteins) and signed arcs (positive or negative) represent regulatory interactions (activations or inhibitions). This graph representation is further associated with logical rules (or logical parameters), which specify how each node is affected by different combinations of regulatory inputs./nThe dynamical behaviour of a logical model can further be represented in terms of a \"state transition graph\", where the nodes denote states, i.e. vectors of values for the different components of the regulatory networks, and the arrows denote transitions between states, according to the logical rules./nDuring the last decades, Thomas' logical modelling approach has been implemented in efficient computer programs, thereby enabling the modelling and analysis of larger models. It has been applied to networks controlling various kinds of biological processes, including virus infection and multiplication, immune cell differentiation, pattern formation in developing animals and plants, mammalian cell signalling, cell cycle, and cell fate decisions.[16]/nThe analyses of genetic network models, led Thomas to realise that \"regulatory circuits\", defined as simple circular paths in the regulatory graphs (cf. above), are playing crucial dynamical roles. This in turn allowed him to distinguish two classes of regulatory circuits, namely positive versus negative circuits, associated with different dynamical and biological properties. On the one hand, positive circuits, involving an even number of negative interactions (or none) can lead to the coexistence of multiple dynamical regimes. On the other hand, negative circuits, involving an odd number of negative interactions, can generate oscillatory behaviour or homeostasis./nIn a further step, considering the regulatory graph associated with a gene network, modelled in terms of logical or differential formalism, Thomas proposed general rules stating that (i) a positive circuit is necessary to display multiple stable states, and (ii) a negative circuit is necessary to have robust sustained oscillations.[17] This has major biological implications since, as first pointed out by Max Delbr\u00fcck[18] and amply confirmed since, cell differentiation essentially results from successive choices between multiple steady states. Thus, any model for a differentiation process has to involve at least one positive circuit./nThe rules proposed by Thomas have inspired various mathematicians, who translated them into rigorous theorems, first referring to ordinary differential equations, but also referring to Boolean and multilevel logical formalisms. This is one of the few cases where biological studies led to the formulation and demonstration of general mathematical theorems.[19][20][21][22]/nThe theoretical studies by Thomas on the properties of genetic regulatory circuits were also accompanied by practical considerations regarding the synthesis of novel circuits, with specific properties, in the bacterium E. coli.[15][23] However, due to various technical problems, the attempts of Thomas' group to build synthetic gene circuits were unsuccessful. It is only at the turn of the millennium that several groups reported the successful synthesis of simple positive circuits (\"toggle switch\") and negative circuits (\"repressillator\" and auto-inhibitory loop).[24][25][26]/nOnce the dynamical properties of complex sets of circuits had been disentangled in logical terms, it was tempting to come back to a more usual and quantitative description in terms of differential equations, taking advantage of the knowledge gained regarding qualitative behaviour. Two articles by Thomas and Marcelline Kaufman compare the logical and differential predictions of the number and nature of the steady states.[27][28] Following articles by Thomas and Marcelle Kaufman, and by Thomas and Pascal Nardone showed that the phase space of the system can be partitioned into domains according to the signs and to the real or complex nature of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix.[29][30]/nIndeed, regulatory circuits can be defined formally as sets of non-empty elements of the Jacobian matrix (or of the interaction graph) of dynamical systems such that the line and column indices are in circular permutation. The sign of a circuit is then given by the product of the signs of the corresponding Jacobian elements. Noteworthy, the nature of steady states depends entirely on the terms of the Jacobian matrix that belong to a circuit as only those terms appear in the characteristic equation of a system and thus take part in the calculation of its eigenvalues.[31]/nThomas further suggested that both a positive circuit and a negative circuit are needed to generate deterministic chaos. With this in mind, a number of surprisingly simple sets of first order differential equations were constructed and shown to display deterministic chaos. The most spectacular one was probably the complex symmetric attractors (\"Labyrinth chaos\") generated by a set of n (n>=3) first order differential equations. This system was further analysed in depth by Sprott and coworkers.[32]/nFrom the very beginning of his career, Thomas recruited and mentored many talented students, with chemistry or biology degree.[33] Most were women, such that a colleague from the US used to call his lab \"the belle laboratoire\". While he was inflexible about scientific rigor, he readily provided his students with a vast freedom of thoughts, experimental design and publication. Many of them, including Martine Thilly, Suzanne Mousset, Albert Herzog, Alex Bollen, Christine Dambly, Josiane Szpirer, Ariane Toussaint, Jean-Pierre Lecocq, Jean Richelle and Denis Thieffry went on pursuing scientific careers in Belgium and France, in the field of molecular genetics on a large set of organisms, from phages to bacteria, fungi, drosophila, zebra fish and humans./nAs Thomas shifted his research interest from biochemistry to phage genetics, then to mathematical biology and finally to dynamical systems, he addressed complex theoretical questions with an experimental mind frame, moving from wet experiments to computational simulations. His contributions to these different fields had and still have an important influence worldwide, in particular in the context of the recent emergence of systems biology./nA series of testimonies and tribute articles can be found in a special issue of the Journal of Theoretical Biology dedicated to the memory of Ren\u00e9 Thomas and published in 2019.[34]", "65745275": "Leo Nicholas Ornston (born 1940) is an American microbiologist who researched the evolution of microbes.

He worked for three years as an associate scientist at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences before the Hungarian revolution against Soviet control in 1956.[2] After the failed revolution, Pusztai escaped to a refugee camp in Austria and from there made his way to England.[3] He completed his doctorate in biochemistry at the Lister Institute in London and continued there with his post-doctorate. In 1963, he was invited to join the Protein Research Department at the Rowett Research Institute in Aberdeen, Scotland. Pusztai worked at the Rowett Institute for the next 36 years, predominately studying plant lectins. During that time, he discovered glycoproteins in plants, authored over 270 research papers, published 3 books,[3] and was considered an \"internationally renowned expert on lectins\".[4] He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1988 and has received fellowships from the Leverhulme Trust.[2] \u00c1rp\u00e1d Pusztai was married to Dr Susan Bard\u00f3cz, with whom he worked at the Rowett Institute following their. He has two daughters from his first marriage and a stepson from his marriage to Dr. Bard\u00f3cz.[5] He died at his home in Aberdeen on December 17, 2021, at the age of 91.[6]/nIn 1995, Pusztai began research on genetically modified potatoes containing the GNA lectin gene from the snowdrop plant.[3] His research team fed raw and cooked genetically modified potatoes to rats, using Desiree Red potatoes as controls. In 1998, Pusztai said in an interview on a World in Action programme that his group had observed damage to the intestines and immune systems of rats fed the genetically modified potatoes. He also said,  \"If I had the choice, I would certainly not eat it,\" and \"I find it's very unfair to use our fellow citizens as guinea pigs.\"[5]/nThis resulted in a media frenzy, and the director of the Rowett Institute, Philip James, after initially supporting Pusztai, suspended him and banned both him and Susan Bardocz from speaking publicly. He also used misconduct procedures to seize the raw data.[5] The Rowett Institute eventually published an audit criticizing Pusztai's results[7] and sent the raw data to six anonymous reviewers, who also criticized Pusztai's work.[8][9] Pusztai sent the audit report and his rebuttal to scientists who requested it, and in February 1999, twenty-one European and American scientists released a memo supporting Pusztai.[10]/nJames and the Rowett Institute released a statement on August 10 falsely accusing Pusztai of using a lectin (Concanavalin A) that was a known toxin. This wasn't true. Pusztai had used the snowdrop lectin, but a gag order prevented him from defending himself publicly until 1999.[11]/nPusztai's experiment was eventually published as a letter in The Lancet in 1999.[12] Because of the controversial nature of his research, the letter was reviewed by six reviewers - three times the usual number. One publicly opposed the letter, another thought it was flawed, but wanted it published \"to avoid suspicions of a conspiracy against Pusztai and to give colleagues a chance to see the data for themselves,\" while the other four raised questions that were addressed by the authors.[13] The letter reported significant differences between the thickness of the gut epithelium of rats fed genetically modified potatoes and of rats fed the control diet.[12]/nThe Royal Society of Medicine declared that the study \u2018is flawed in many aspects of design, execution and analysis\u2019 and that \u2018no conclusions should be drawn from it\u2019.[14] For example, too few rats per test group were used to derive meaningful, statistically significant data.[14]/nHe was one of several scientists interviewed in the 2010 documentary Scientists Under Attack: Genetic Engineering in the Magnetic Field of Money who, based on their findings, have criticized the use of genetic modification for food./nPusztai's annual contract at Rowett was not renewed following the incident and he moved back to Hungary. He has been giving lectures on his GE potato work and on claimed dangers in general of genetic engineering of crop plants.[15] In 2005, he received the Whistleblower Award of the Federation of German Scientists and the German section of the International Association of Lawyers against Nuclear Arms (IALANA).[2][16] In 2009, Pusztai and his wife, Prof. Bard\u00f3cz Zsuzsa, received the Stuttgart Peace Prize.[17][18]", "78219": "Masanobu Fukuoka (Japanese: \u798f\u5ca1 \u6b63\u4fe1, Hepburn: Fukuoka Masanobu, 2 February 1913 \u2013 16 August 2008) was a Japanese farmer and philosopher celebrated for his natural farming and re-vegetation of desertified lands. He was a proponent of no-till, herbicide and pesticide free cultivation methods from which he created a particular method of agriculture, commonly referred to as \"natural farming\" or \"do-nothing farming\".[1][2][3][4][5][6]/nFukuoka was the author of several books, scientific papers and other publications, and was featured in television documentaries and interviews from the 1970s onwards.[7] His influences went beyond farming to inspire individuals within the natural food and lifestyle movements. He was an outspoken advocate of the value of observing nature's principles.[8]/nFukuoka was born on 2 February 1913 in Iyo, Ehime, Japan, the second son of Kameichi Fukuoka, an educated and wealthy land owner and local leader. He attended Gifu Prefecture Agricultural College and trained as a microbiologist and agricultural scientist, beginning a career as a research scientist specialising in plant pathology. He worked at the Plant Inspection Division of the Yokohama Customs Bureau in 1934 as an agricultural customs inspector. In 1937 he was hospitalised with pneumonia, and while recovering, he stated that he had a profound spiritual experience that transformed his world view[9][10][11] and led him to doubt the practices of modern \"Western\" agricultural science. He immediately resigned from his post as a research scientist, returning to his family's farm on the island of Shikoku in southern Japan./nFrom 1938, Fukuoka began to practice and experiment with new techniques on organic citrus orchards and used the observations gained to develop the idea of \"Natural Farming\". Among other practices, he abandoned pruning an area of citrus trees, which caused the trees to become affected by insects and the branches to become entangled. He stated that the experience taught him the difference between nature and non-intervention.[12][13] His efforts were interrupted by World War II, during which he worked at the K\u014dchi Prefecture agricultural experiment station on subjects including farming research and food production./nIn 1940, Fukuoka married his wife Ayako, and they had five children together. After World War II, his father lost most of the family lands in postwar land reform and was left with three-eighths of an acre of rice land and the hillside citrus orchards his son had taken over before the war. Despite these circumstances, in 1947 he took up natural farming again with success, using no-till farming methods to raise rice and barley. He wrote his first book, Mu 1: The God Revolution, or Mu 1: Kami no Kakumei (\u7121\u30081\u3009\u795e\u306e\u9769\u547d) in Japanese, during the same year, and worked to spread word of the benefits of his methods and philosophy. His later book, The One-Straw Revolution, was published in 1975 and translated into English in 1978./nFrom 1979, Fukuoka travelled the world extensively, giving lectures, working directly to plant seeds and re-vegetate areas, and receiving a number of awards in various countries in recognition of his work and achievements. By the 1980s, Fukuoka recorded that he and his family shipped some 6,000 crates of citrus to Tokyo each year, totalling about 90 tonnes.[11]/nDuring his first journey overseas, Fukuoka was accompanied by his wife Ayako, met macrobiotic diet leaders Michio Kushi and Herman Aihara,[14] and was guided by his leading supporter and translation editor Larry Korn. They sowed seeds in desertified land, visited the University of California in Berkeley and Los Angeles, the Green Gulch Farm Zen Center, the Lundberg Family Farms, and met with United Nations UNCCD representatives including Maurice Strong, who encouraged Fukuoka's practical involvement in the \"Plan of Action to Combat Desertification\". He also travelled to New York City and surrounding areas such as Boston and Amherst College in Massachusetts./nIn 1983, he travelled to Europe for 50 days holding workshops, educating farmers and sowing seeds. In 1985, he spent 40 days in Somalia and Ethiopia, sowing seeds  to re-vegetate desert areas, including working in remote villages and a refugee camp. The following year he returned to the United States, speaking at three international conferences on natural farming[14] in Washington state, San Francisco and at the Agriculture Department of the University of California, Santa Cruz. Fukuoka also took the opportunity to visit farms, forests and cities giving lectures and meeting people. In 1988, he lectured at the Indian Science Congress, state agricultural universities and other venues./nFukuoka went to Thailand in 1990 and 1991, visiting farms and collecting seeds for re-vegetating deserts in India, which he returned to during November and December that year in an attempt to re-vegetate them. The next year saw him participate in official meetings in Japan associated with the Earth Summit in Rio, Brazil, and in 1996 he returned to Africa, sowing seeds in desert areas of Tanzania, observing baobab trees and jungle country. He taught the making and sowing of clay seed balls in Vietnam during 1995./nHe travelled to the Philippines in 1998, carrying out Natural Farming research, and visited Greece later that year to assist plans to re-vegetate 10,000 hectares (40 sq. mi.) around the Lake Vegoritida area in the Pella regional unit and to produce a film of the major seed ball effort. The next year he returned to Europe, visiting Mallorca./nHe visited China in 2001, and in 2002 he returned again to India to speak at the \"Nature as Teacher\" workshop at Navdanya Farm and at Bija Vidyapeeth Earth University in Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand in northern India. On Gandhi's Day, he gave the third annual Albert Howard Memorial Lecture to attendees from all six continents. That autumn he was to visit Afghanistan with Yuko Honma but was unable to attend, shipping eight tons of seed in his stead. In 2005, he gave a brief lecture at the World Expo in Aichi Prefecture, Japan,[15] and in May 2006 he appeared in an hour-long interview on Japanese television network NHK.[16]/nMasanobu Fukuoka died on 16 August 2008 at the age of 95, after a period of declining mobility that made him reliant on a wheelchair.[17]/nFukuoka called his agricultural philosophy shizen n\u014dh\u014d (\u81ea\u7136\u8fb2\u6cd5), most commonly translated into English as \"natural farming\".[18] It is also referred to as \"the Fukuoka Method\", \"the natural way of farming\" or \"Do-Nothing Farming\"./nThe system is based on the recognition of the complexity of living organisms that shape an ecosystem and deliberately exploiting it. Fukuoka saw farming not just as a means of producing food but as an aesthetic and spiritual approach to life,[19][page\u00a0needed] the ultimate goal of which was \"the cultivation and perfection of human beings\".[20]/nThe four principles of natural farming are that:[21]/nFukuoka re-invented and advanced the use of clay seed balls. Clay seed balls were originally an ancient practice in which seeds for the next season's crops are mixed together, sometimes with humus or compost for microbial inoculants, and then are rolled within clay to form into small balls. This method is now commonly used in guerilla gardening to rapidly seed restricted or private areas.[22]/nIn 1988, Fukuoka received the Visva-Bharati University's Desikottam Award[23] as well as the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service in the Philippines,[24] often considered \"Asia's Nobel Prize\".[25]/nIn March 1997, the Earth Summit+5 forum in Rio de Janeiro presented him with the Earth Council Award, received in person at a ceremony in Tokyo on 26 May of that year,[26] honouring him for his contributions to sustainable development.[23]/nIn 1998, Fukuoka received a grant of US$10,000 from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, but the grant was returned because his advanced age prevented him from completing the project.[27]/nIn the international development of the organic farming movement, Fukuoka is considered to be amongst the \"five giant personalities who inspired the movement\"[28] along with Austrian Rudolf Steiner, German-Swiss Hans M\u00fcller, Lady Eve Balfour in the United Kingdom and J. I. Rodale in the United States./nHis books are considered both farming compendiums and guides to a way of life.[3]:\u200a(1)/nThe One-Straw Revolution has been translated into over 20 languages and sold more than one million copies[3] and Fukuoka has been widely influential, inspiring an international movement of individuals discovering and applying his principles to varying degrees,[3] such as Akinori Kimura,[29] David Mas Masumoto[30] and Yoshikazu Kawaguchi,[31] and has significantly influenced alternative movements in the West, such as permaculture.[32][33]/nRosana Tositrakul, a Thai activist and politician, spent a year studying with Fukuoka on his farm. She then organised a visit by Fukuoka to the Kut Chum District of Yasothon Province in northeastern Thailand, which, together with his books, were influential in the rapid and widespread adoption of organic and chemical-free rice farming in the district.[34]/nIn the preface to the US editions of The One-Straw Revolution, Wendell Berry wrote that Fukuoka's techniques are not \"directly applicable to most American farms\", but ultimately concludes that it would be \"a mistake to assume that the practical passages of this book are worthless...\" suggesting that Natural Farming would require farmers to have fresh eyes and the right kind of concern for their land in order to come up with methods relevant to their own farms./nFukuoka's techniques have proven difficult to apply, even on most Japanese farms, and have been described as a sophisticated approach despite their simple appearance.[31] In the initial years of transition from conventional farming there are losses in crop yields. Fukuoka estimated these to be 10% while others, such as Yoshikazu Kawaguchi, have found attempting to strictly follow Fukuoka's techniques led to crop failures and require many years of adaption to make the principles work.[31]/nIn the early 2000s, Theodor Friedrich and Josef Kienzle of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) opined that his rejection of mechanisation is not justifiable for modern agricultural production[35] and that the system cannot interact effectively with conventional agricultural systems.[36]/nMore recently however, the FAO (along with multiple research universities and organizations such as the Union of Concerned Scientists) have found conventional industrial agriculture systems to be rooted in unsustainable practices that ignore basic biology and the needs of ecosystems.[37]  Many of Fukuoka's principles are now being incorporated into modern forms of farming that are more biodiverse, less reliant on chemicals and machines, and which produce similar yields while increasing the health of the soil and surrounding environment.[38] In particular, the concepts of non-tillage, relay cropping, cover-cropping, and plant biodiversity have been shown to prevent soil loss, reduce or eliminate the need for pesticides or fertilizers, and reduce flooding, while increasing water retention, and providing habitat for insects that contribute positively to both crop and ecosystem health.[39][40]/nIn Japan, where Fukuoka had few followers or associates,[8] his critics argue that the \"inner world and the connection between humans and nature does not, however, exhaust reality\" and that he did not give sufficient attention to interpersonal relationships or society.[8] These criticisms were in some ways addressed by the next generation of natural farmers in Japan such as Yoshikazu Kawaguchi, who started a movement of widespread free schools, and yearly conferences to help spread the mindset of natural farming. There are now over 40 learning sites and more than 900 concurrent students in the Japanese natural farming network./nFukuoka's farm in Shikoku was taken over by his son and daughter-in-law in the late 1980s, as Fukuoka reached an advanced age.[41] His grandson also took up farming. Many of the farm's iyokan and amanatsu mikan trees remain,[3] although some old iyokan were replaced by new varieties of fruit. Woodlands remain along with orchards, including some areas of wild vegetables still growing amongst them. Some areas of straw-mulched cropping continue to produce grains and vegetables. The farm also features an orchard area of ginkgo trees, shiitake mushroom crops growing on tree logs in shady woodland, and plantings of limes, grapefruits, feijoas, avocados and mangoes.[42][43]/nThe farm is now[when?] run using some natural farming techniques: no chemicals, no tillage of the land and no use of composting. Other techniques have been changed; the pattern of irrigation is more conventional to reduce conflicts with neighbours. A do-nothing philosophy has been followed on the hilltop surrounding Fukuoka's hut. Here it has become a natural, fruit-bearing forest with minimal intervention.[44]", "56701325": "Emer Colleran (12 October 1945 \u2013 30 June 2018) was an Irish microbiologist, academic and an environmental advocate.

In 1981, as chairman of the Galway branch, she hit back at claims from Galway County Council that An Taisce were an anonymous group, wielding power unfairly.[9] She was involved in the compilation of a controversial planning report, published by An Taisce in 1983, which highlighted abuse of planning laws by city and county councillors across Ireland, and in particular in counties Galway, Mayo, Donegal, Kerry and Louth.[10][11]/nShe served as Environmental Officer for An Taisce before being elected National Chairman in 1987, the first time a chairman had come from one of the western county associations.[12] She continued to use her position to campaign against misuse of planning laws,[13] for a clamp down on pollution of rivers and lakes,[14] and against a move to scrap An Foras Forbartha, a body that provided independent monitoring of pollution.[15] During her three years as chairman, until May 1990, she was particularly involved in debates over local environmental and planning issues, in particular over gold mining in the west of Ireland, a proposed airport for Clifden, and the planned sewage treatment plant at Mutton Island in Galway.[2]/nIn 1991 plans were announced for a new visitor centre, to be located at Mullaghmore in The Burren. Colleran was among those who were part of an appeal, saying that while the plan for the national park was welcomed by An Taisce, they wanted the visitor centre to be located three or four miles from Mullaghmore.[16]/nPresident Mary Robinson appointed seven new members to her Council of State in February 1991, including Colleran.[17][18] Other new members appointed at the time were Monica Barnes, Patricia O'Donovan, Quintan Oliver, Rosemarie Smith, D\u00f3nal Toolan and D.

She was initially an Adjunct Assistant Professor, then was appointed to Assistant Professor in 1967. She was promoted to Associate Professor in 1971, to full Professor in 1977, and to University Professor in 1986. In 1988 she was appointed Distinguished Professor of Botany at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. She was Distinguished Professor of Biology in 1993. In 1997 she transferred to the Department of Geosciences at UMass Amherst to become Distinguished Professor of Geosciences \"with great delight\",[23] the post which she held until her death.[24]/nMargulis married astronomer Carl Sagan in 1957 soon after she got her bachelor's degree. Sagan was then a graduate student in physics at the University of Chicago. Their marriage ended in 1964, just before she completed her PhD. They had two sons, Dorion Sagan, who later became a popular science writer and her collaborator, and Jeremy Sagan, software developer and founder of Sagan Technology./nIn 1967 she married Thomas N. Margulis, a crystallographer. They had a son named Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma, a New York City criminal defense lawyer, and a daughter Jennifer Margulis, teacher and author.[25][26] They divorced in 1980./nShe commented, \"I quit my job as a wife twice,\" and, \"it's not humanly possible to be a good wife, a good mother, and a first-class scientist. No one can do it \u2014 something has to go.\"[26]/nIn the 2000s she had a relationship with fellow biologist Ricardo Guerrero.[16]/nHer sister Joan Alexander married Nobel Laureate Sheldon Glashow; another sister, Sharon, married mathematician Daniel Kleitman./nShe was a religious agnostic,[16] and a staunch evolutionist, but rejected the modern evolutionary synthesis,[11] and said: \"I remember waking up one day with an epiphanous revelation: I am not a neo-Darwinist! I recalled an earlier experience, when I realized that I wasn't a humanistic Jew. Although I greatly admire Darwin's contributions and agree with most of his theoretical analysis and I am a Darwinist, I am not a neo-Darwinist.\"[7] She argued that \"Natural selection eliminates and maybe maintains, but it doesn't create\", and maintained that symbiosis was the major driver of evolutionary change.[11]/nIn 2013 Margulis was listed as having been a member of the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education.[27]/nMargulis died on 22 November 2011 at home in Amherst, Massachusetts, five days after suffering a hemorrhagic stroke.[1][2][26][28] As her wish, she was cremated and her ashes were scattered in her favorite research areas, near her home.[29]/nIn 1966, as a young faculty member at Boston University, Margulis wrote a theoretical paper titled \"On the Origin of Mitosing Cells\".[31] The paper, however, was \"rejected by about fifteen scientific journals,\" she recalled.[7] It was finally accepted by Journal of Theoretical Biology and is considered today a landmark in modern endosymbiotic theory. Weathering constant criticism of her ideas for decades, Margulis was famous for her tenacity in pushing her theory forward, despite the opposition she faced at the time.[2] The descent of mitochondria from bacteria and of chloroplasts from cyanobacteria was experimentally demonstrated in 1978 by Robert Schwartz and Margaret Dayhoff.[32] This formed the first experimental evidence for the symbiogenesis theory.[2] The endosymbiosis theory of organogenesis became widely accepted in the early 1980s, after the genetic material of mitochondria and chloroplasts had been found to be significantly different from that of the symbiont's nuclear DNA.[33]/nIn 1995, English evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins had this to say about Lynn Margulis and her work:/nI greatly admire Lynn Margulis's sheer courage and stamina in sticking by the endosymbiosis theory, and carrying it through from being an unorthodoxy to an orthodoxy. I'm referring to the theory that the eukaryotic cell is a symbiotic union of primitive prokaryotic cells. This is one of the great achievements of twentieth-century evolutionary biology, and I greatly admire her for it.[7]/nMargulis opposed competition-oriented views of evolution, stressing the importance of symbiotic or cooperative relationships between species.[8]/nShe later formulated a theory that proposed symbiotic relationships between organisms of different phyla, or kingdoms, as the driving force of evolution, and explained genetic variation as occurring mainly through transfer of nuclear information between bacterial cells or viruses and eukaryotic cells.[8] Her organelle genesis ideas are now widely accepted, but the proposal that symbiotic relationships explain most genetic variation is still something of a fringe idea.[8]/nMargulis also held a negative view of certain interpretations of Neo-Darwinism that she felt were excessively focused on competition between organisms, as she believed that history will ultimately judge them as comprising \"a minor twentieth-century religious sect within the sprawling religious persuasion of Anglo-Saxon Biology.\"[8]\nShe wrote that proponents of the standard theory \"wallow in their zoological, capitalistic, competitive, cost-benefit interpretation of Darwin \u2013 having mistaken him ... Neo-Darwinism, which insists on [the slow accrual of mutations by gene-level natural selection], is in a complete funk.\"[8]/nMargulis initially sought out the advice of James Lovelock for her own research: she explained that, \"In the early seventies, I was trying to align bacteria by their metabolic pathways. I noticed that all kinds of bacteria produced gases. Oxygen, hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, ammonia\u2014more than thirty different gases are given off by the bacteria whose evolutionary history I was keen to reconstruct. Why did every scientist I asked believe that atmospheric oxygen was a biological product but the other atmospheric gases\u2014nitrogen, methane, sulfur, and so on\u2014were not? 'Go talk to Lovelock,' at least four different scientists suggested. Lovelock believed that the gases in the atmosphere were biological.\"[7]/nMargulis met with Lovelock, who explained his Gaia hypothesis to her, and very soon they began an intense collaborative effort on the concept.[7] One of the earliest significant publications on Gaia was a 1974 paper co-authored by Lovelock and Margulis, which succinctly defined the hypothesis as follows: \"The notion of the biosphere as an active adaptive control system able to maintain the Earth in homeostasis we are calling the 'Gaia hypothesis.'\"[34]/nLike other early presentations of Lovelock's idea, the Lovelock-Margulis 1974 paper seemed to give living organisms complete agency in creating planetary self-regulation, whereas later, as the idea matured, this planetary-scale self-regulation was recognized as an emergent property of the Earth system, life and its physical environment taken together.[35] When climatologist Stephen Schneider convened the 1989 American Geophysical Union Chapman Conference around the issue of Gaia, the idea of \"strong Gaia\" and \"weak Gaia\" was introduced by James Kirchner, after which Margulis was sometimes associated with the idea of \"weak Gaia\", incorrectly (her essay \"Gaia is a Tough Bitch\" dates from 1995 \u2013 and it stated her own distinction from Lovelock as she saw it, which was primarily that she did not like the metaphor of Earth as a single organism, because, she said, \"No organism eats its own waste\").[7] In her 1998 book Symbiotic Planet, Margulis explored the relationship between Gaia and her work on symbiosis.[36]/nIn 1969, life on earth was classified into five kingdoms, as introduced by Robert Whittaker.[37] Margulis became the most important supporter, as well as critic[38] \u2013 while supporting parts, she was the first to recognize the limitations of Whittaker's classification of microbes.[39] But later discoveries of new organisms, such as archaea, and emergence of molecular taxonomy challenged the concept.[40] By the mid-2000s, most scientists began to agree that there are more than five kingdoms.[41][42] Margulis became the most important defender of the five kingdom classification. She rejected the three-domain system introduced by Carl Woese in 1990, which gained wide acceptance. She introduced a modified classification by which all life forms, including the newly discovered, could be integrated into the classical five kingdoms. According to Margulis, the main problem, archaea, falls under the kingdom Prokaryotae alongside bacteria (in contrast to the three-domain system, which treats archaea as a higher taxon than kingdom, or the six-kingdom system, which holds that it is a separate kingdom).[40] Margulis' concept is given in detail in her book Five Kingdoms, written with Karlene V. Schwartz.[43] It has been suggested that it is mainly because of Margulis that the five-kingdom system survives.[23]/nIt has been suggested that initial rejection of Margulis' work on the endosymbiotic theory, and the controversial nature of it as well as Gaia theory, made her identify throughout her career with scientific mavericks, outsiders, and unaccepted theories generally.[4] In the last decade of her life, while key components of her life's work began to be understood as fundamental to a modern scientific viewpoint \u2013 the widespread adoption of Earth System Science and the incorporation of key parts of endosymbiotic theory into biology curricula worldwide \u2013 Margulis if anything became more embroiled in controversy, not less. Journalist John Wilson explained this by saying that Lynn Margulis \"defined herself by oppositional science,\"[44] and in the commemorative collection of essays Lynn Margulis: The Life and Legacy of a Scientific Rebel, commentators again and again depict her as a modern embodiment of the \"scientific rebel\",[4] akin to Freeman Dyson's 1995 essay The Scientist as Rebel, a tradition Dyson saw embodied in Benjamin Franklin, and which Dyson believed to be essential to good science.[45]/nIn 2009, via a then-standard publication-process known as \"communicated submission\" (which bypassed traditional peer review), she was instrumental in getting the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) to publish a paper by Donald I. Williamson rejecting \"the Darwinian assumption that larvae and their adults evolved from a single common ancestor.\"[46][47] Williamson's paper provoked immediate response from the scientific community, including a countering paper in PNAS.[46] Conrad Labandeira of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History said, \"If I was reviewing [Williamson's paper] I would probably opt to reject it,\" he says, \"but I'm not saying it's a bad thing that this is published. What it may do is broaden the discussion on how metamorphosis works and [...] [on] the origin of these very radical life cycles.\" But Duke University insect developmental biologist Fred Nijhout said that the paper was better suited for the \"National Enquirer than the National Academy.\"[48] In September it was announced that PNAS would eliminate communicated submissions in July 2010. PNAS stated that the decision had nothing to do with the Williamson controversy.[47]/nIn 2009 Margulis and seven others authored a position paper concerning research on the viability of round body forms of some spirochetes, \"Syphilis, Lyme disease, & AIDS: Resurgence of 'the great imitator'?\"[49] which states that, \"Detailed research that correlates life histories of symbiotic spirochetes to changes in the immune system of associated vertebrates is sorely needed\", and urging the \"reinvestigation of the natural history of mammalian, tick-borne, and venereal transmission of spirochetes in relation to impairment of the human immune system\". The paper went on to suggest \"that the possible direct causal involvement of spirochetes and their round bodies to symptoms of immune deficiency be carefully and vigorously investigated\".[49]/nIn a Discover Magazine interview, Margulis explained her reason for interest in the topic of the 2009 \"AIDS\" paper: \"I'm interested in spirochetes only because of our ancestry. I'm not interested in the diseases\", and stated that she had called them \"symbionts\" because both the spirochete which causes syphilis (Treponema) and the spirochete which causes Lyme disease (Borrelia) only retain about 20% of the genes they would need to live freely, outside of their human hosts.[11]/nHowever, in the Discover Magazine interview Margulis said that \"the set of symptoms, or syndrome, presented by syphilitics overlaps completely with another syndrome: AIDS\", and also noted that Kary Mullis[a] said that \"he went looking for a reference substantiating that HIV causes AIDS and discovered, 'There is no such document'\u202f\".[11]/nThis provoked a widespread supposition that Margulis had been an \"AIDS denialist\". Jerry Coyne reacted on his Why Evolution is True blog against his interpretation that Margulis believed \"that AIDS is really syphilis, not viral in origin at all.\"[50] Seth Kalichman, a social psychologist who studies behavioral and social aspects of AIDS, cited her [Murgulis] 2009 paper as an example of AIDS denialism \"flourishing\",[51] and asserted that her [Margulis] \"endorsement of HIV/AIDS denialism defies understanding\".[52]/nMargulis argued that the September 11 attacks were a \"false-flag operation, which has been used to justify the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as unprecedented assaults on [...] civil liberties.\" She claimed that there was \"overwhelming evidence that the three buildings [of the World Trade Center] collapsed by controlled demolition.\"[4]", "21279149": "Jostein Goks\u00f8yr (28 June 1922 \u2013 5 December 2000) was a Norwegian microbiologist./nHe was born in Kopervik, and took the dr.philos. degree in 1955.

He is known for his books about Lenin and the Russian Civil War in which he participated./nOssendowski was born on 27 May 1876, at his family's manorial estate near Ludza, in what was then the Vitebsk Governorate and is now Latvia. His family was Protestant with Lipka Tatar roots. He studied at the famous gymnasium in Kamieniec Podolski, but he moved with his father, a renowned doctor, to Saint Petersburg, where he graduated from a Russian language school. Then he joined the mathematical-physical faculty of the local university, where he studied chemistry. As an assistant to professor Aleksander Zalewski, he traveled to many distant areas, including Siberia, the Caucasus and the Altay Mountains. During the summer, he was frequently enrolled as a ship's writer on the Odessa-Vladivostok line, a job that allowed him to visit many parts of Asia, including Japan, Sumatra, China, Malaya and Indonesia. For his description of his trip to Crimea and Constantinople, he received his first royalty. His record of a trip to India (Chmura nad Gangesem: A Cloud Over the Ganges) gained the prestigious Petersburg Society of Literature prize./nIn 1899, after a students' riot in Saint Petersburg, Ossendowski was forced to leave Imperial Russia and move to Paris, where he continued his studies at the Sorbonne, his professors being Maria Curie-Sk\u0142odowska and Marcelin Berthelot. It is possible that he received a doctorate back in Russia, but no documents have survived. In 1901 he was allowed to return to Russia, where professor Zalewski invited him to the newly founded Institute of Technology of the Tomsk State University. There, he gave lectures on chemistry and physics. At the same time he also gave lectures at the Agricultural Academy and published numerous scientific works on hydrology, geology, physical chemistry, geography and physics./nAfter the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u20131905) Ossendowski moved to Harbin in Manchuria, where he founded a Central Technical Research Laboratory, a Russian-financed institution for development of the ore deposits in the area. At the same time, he headed the local branch of the Russian Geographic Society in Vladivostok. As such he made numerous trips to Korea, Sakhalin, Ussuri and the shores of the Bering Strait. In Manchuria, he also became one of the leaders of the considerable Polish diaspora and published his first novel in Polish, Noc (Night). He also got involved in the Main Revolutionary Committee, a leftist organisation that tried to take power in Manchuria during the Revolution of 1905. After the failure of the revolution, Ossendowski organised a strike against the brutal repressions in Congress Poland for which he was arrested. A military tribunal sentenced him to death for conspiracy against the tsar, but his sentence was later commuted to several years' hard labour./nIn 1907, he was released from prison with a so-called wolf ticket, which prevented him from finding a job or leaving Russia. At that time he devoted himself to writing. His novel V ludskoi pyli (In Human Dust), in which he described his several years' stay in Russian prisons, gained him much popularity in Russia. His popularity allowed him to return to St Petersburg in 1908. There he continued to write books and at the same time headed the Society of the Gold and Platinum Industry and several newspapers and journals, both in Russian and in Polish. After the outbreak of World War I, Ossendowski published several more books, including a science fiction novel, a propaganda novel on German spies in Russia and a brochure describing German and Austro-Hungarian war crimes./nAfter the outbreak of the February Revolution of 1917, Ossendowski moved yet again, to Siberia, this time to Omsk, where he started giving lectures at the local university. After the October Revolution and the outbreak of the Russian Civil War, he also got involved in the counterrevolutionary Russian government led by Supreme Governor Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak. He served at various posts, among others as an intelligence officer, an envoy to the intervention corps from the United States and an assistant to the Polish 5th Rifle Division of Maj. Walerian Czuma. In 1918 he was responsible for the transfer of many tsarist and White Russian documents to the Entente, including proofs (many apparently forged) of German support (confirmed later from German archives) for Lenin and his Bolsheviks (so-called Sisson Documents)./nAfter Kolchak's defeat in 1920, Ossendowski joined a group of Poles and White Russians trying to escape from communist-controlled Siberia to India through Mongolia, China and Tibet.[3] After a journey of several thousand miles, the group reached Chinese-controlled Mongolia, only to be stopped there by the takeover of the country led by mysterious Baron Roman Ungern von Sternberg. The Baron was a mystic who was fascinated by the beliefs and religions of the Far East such as Buddhism and \"who believed himself to be a reincarnation of Kangchendz\u00f6nga, the Mongolian god of war.\"[4] Ungern-Sternberg's philosophy was an exceptionally muddled mixture of Russian nationalism with Chinese and Mongol beliefs. However, he also proved to be an exceptional military commander, and his forces grew rapidly./nOssendowski joined the baron's army as a commanding officer of one of the self-defense troops. He also briefly became Ungern's political advisor and chief of intelligence. Little is known of his service at the latter post, which adds to Ossendowski's legend as a mysterious person. In late 1920, he was sent with a diplomatic mission to Japan and then the US, never to return to Mongolia. Some writers believe that Ossendowski was one of the people who hid the semimythical treasures of Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg.[5]/nAfter his arrival in New York City, Ossendowski started to work for the Polish diplomatic service and possibly as a spy. At the same time, in late 1921 he published his first book in English: Beasts, Men and Gods. The description of his travels during the Russian Civil War and the campaigns led by the Bloody Baron became a striking success and a bestseller. In 1923, it was translated into Polish and then into several other languages./nIn 1922, Ossendowski returned to Poland and settled in Warsaw. Immediately upon his return, he started giving lectures at the Wolna Wszechnica Polska, Higher War School and School of Political Sciences at the Warsaw University. At the same time, he remained an advisor to the Polish government and an expert sovietologist./nHe continued to travel to different parts of the world, and after each journey he published a book or two. In the interwar period, he was considered the creator of a distinct genre called the traveling novel. With over 70 books published in Poland and translated almost 150 times into 20 other languages, Ossendowski was also the second most popular Polish author abroad, after Henryk Sienkiewicz. He repeated the success of his Beasts, Men and Gods with a book on Lenin in which he openly criticized Soviet communist methods and policies as well as the double face of the communist leaders. In Poland, three of his books were being filmed at the moment World War II started./nAfter the 1939 Invasion of Poland and the outbreak of World War II, Ossendowski remained in Warsaw, where he lived at 27 Gr\u00f3jecka Street. In 1942 he converted to Catholicism (previously being a Lutheran), and the following year, he joined the ranks of the underground National Party. He worked in the structures of the Polish Secret State and cooperated with the Government Delegate's Office in preparation of the underground education in Poland during World War II and postwar learning programmes./nAfter the Warsaw Uprising, Ossendowski, now seriously ill, moved to the village of \u017b\u00f3\u0142win, near the Warsaw suburb of Milan\u00f3wek. On 2 January 1945, he was taken to the hospital in Grodzisk Mazowiecki where he died on 3 January 1945.[1] He was buried the following day in the local cemetery in Milan\u00f3wek./nTwo weeks after Ossendowski's death, on 18 January, the area was seized by the Red Army. It turned out that Ossendowski was being sought by the NKVD, and was being considered an enemy of the people for his book on Lenin and the Soviet system, which was considered an act of anti-Soviet agitation. The Soviet agents exhumed his body to confirm his identity and that he was really dead.[6]/nAfter the war, the new communist Soviet-led authorities of Poland issued a ban on all books by Ossendowski. Many of his books were confiscated from the libraries and burnt.[citation needed] It was not until 1989 that his books were again published openly in Poland./nThe relative obscurity of much of Ossendowski's output means that many books have been published twice under different names or with no date of publication.

It worked, so we published a paper on how we'd handled the crisis\".[3]/nWhen the staph outbreak spread northward, the University of Minnesota received a $1\u00a0million grant to conduct research on it, and invited Greene to join its faculty as an assistant professor.[3][5] Greene moved his family back to Minnesota in 1959,[4] and developed the first university-level curriculum in environmental microbiology.[8] He lectured at the university until 1986,[4] teaching more than 30,000 public health students.[1][9]/nIn 1961 Greene was hired by NASA's Planetary Quarantine Division to head an astrobiology project in conjunction with the search for life on Mars.[3][6] The space scientists were concerned that \"extraterrestrial microbes\" might adhere to spacecraft and be transported back to earth.[3] Greene led a research team in Minneapolis which collected and analyzed aerosol samples from the Earth's stratosphere.[3][5] He continued working for NASA on the Apollo and Viking programs.[3]/nLiving in Minneapolis, the Greenes enrolled their children in a small Torah day school to ensure they received a Jewish education.[3] Greene was inspired to increase his own Jewish knowledge after agreeing to meet the city's newly-appointed Chabad shaliach (emissary) in 1962.[4] The shaliach suddenly interrupted their conversation to pray the afternoon service, which Greene regarded as an insult.[4] But when the rabbi explained that \"What I came for was very, very important, but what I had to do now was even more important\", Greene was intrigued.[7] Impressed by the shaliach's sincerity and dedication, he agreed to study with him and slowly took on more religious observance.[8]/nWhen Greene began asking questions about how religious Jews reconcile the theory of evolution with the Genesis creation narrative, the shaliach introduced him to the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, who had studied science and mathematics at the university level in Berlin and Paris.[8] Greene began a scientific and personal correspondence with the Rebbe that lasted from 1963 until the Rebbe's death in 1994.[3][8][9] The Rebbe expressed interest in seeing all of Greene's scientific papers and would critique them.[8] Eventually the Rebbe clarified all of Greene's doubts about the evolution vs. Creation debate.[10]/n\"Is this right?\" Greene asked the Rebbe. \"Can I really do this? Other religions say you shouldn't search. And the Torah doesn't say there's life on Mars.\"/n\"Professor Greene\", the Rebbe replied, \"you should look for life on Mars. And if you don't find it there, you should look elsewhere. And if you don't find it there, you should look elsewhere. Because for you to sit here and say that God didn't create life elsewhere is to put limits on God, and no one can do that\"./nGreene laid tefillin for the first time in 1966 after receiving a pair as a gift from the Rebbe.[5][10] With the encouragement of his wife, who wanted a kosher home, Greene slowly became a kippah-wearing, Shabbat-observant Jew.[3][5] He later served as an emissary for the Rebbe, smuggling in books and religious objects to Jews in the Soviet Union.[3] His transformation from a secular Jewish professor to a Lubavitcher Hasid became part of Chabad lore.[2] In 2017, the Tzeirei Hashluchim produced an animation of Greene's first meeting with the Chabad shaliach for the purpose of instructing youngsters in shlichus work.[2]/nGreene taught at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev on two sabbaticals, in 1977 and 1984.[1] In 1986, he and his wife immigrated to Israel, where he accepted a professorship in public health and epidemiology at the university and also served as director of the school's new Jewish medical ethics program.[3][5] The latter position saw him participate in a 1989 conference organized by bioethicist Arthur Caplan, which was the first to discuss the ethics of using data from Nazi human experimentation in modern-day scientific research.[11]/nGreene lectured around the world on the compatibility between Torah teachings and scientific knowledge,[2][5] and had a morning talk show program on public television.[9] He retired from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in 2009.[9]/nIn 1983 Greene received a Bush Foundation fellowship and was named a Senior Fulbright Lecturer by the Council for International Exchange of Scholars.[8]/nGreene met his wife, Gail Chesler, a music student at the University of Minnesota, in 1955; they married a year later.[1][5] The couple had two sons and three daughters.[6] Both their sons became Chabad shluchim in the United States.[3]/nGreene died on November 21, 2011, aged 83.[6] His sons edited and published his autobiography, Curiosity and the Desire for Truth: The spiritual journey of a NASA scientist, in 2015.[7]", "4239889": "Thomas Carell (born 1966) is a German biochemist./nCarell was born in 1966 in Herford Germany, he studied chemistry from 1985 till 1990 at the University of M\u00fcnster finishing with a diploma thesis at the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research Heidelberg.

She is the founding Director of the Center for Regenerative Medicine and emeritus professor at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. She has founded two biotechnology companies, Arcos BioScience (1999) and Aspen Neuroscience (2018)/nLoring was born on May 4, 1950, in Tucson, Arizona, to William and Elizabeth Loring.  She has one sister, Anne Loring, who is an attorney.  Her father had a Ph.D. in geology, and his job as a uranium and copper prospector required that the family move frequently.  Loring grew up in mining towns in Arizona, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Wyoming.  Bill Loring was an intellectual, and at home, he filled in the gaps of her small-town education. In 1968, Loring was selected for a National Merit Scholarship, which allowed her to attend the University of Washington in Seattle, where she completed a bachelor of science degree, magna cum laude, in molecular biology in 1972[1] and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa./nLoring began her graduate studies as a National Science Foundation Research Fellow[2] in the newly established Institute for Molecular Biology at the University of Oregon in Eugene, where she became interested in stem cell development through her research on neural crest cells.[3][4] She earned her Ph.D. in 1979 and began work as a visiting assistant professor at the University of California Davis./nAfter completing her doctoral work, Loring spent five years studying and lecturing on embryology and neurobiology at UC Davis before moving to the biotechnology industry. As Staff Scientist at Hana Biologics (1987-1989), Loring's work included development of cell therapy for Parkinson's disease. She then began to focus on the intersection of genomics with stem cells as a Senior Scientist at GenPharm International[5] (1989\u20131995), Senior Research Fellow at Molecular Dynamics (1995\u20131997), and Senior Director at Incyte Genomics (1997\u20132001).  At GenPharm, Loring worked on gene editing in mouse embryonic stem cells, and created mouse models for human disease. She was the first to produce a transgenic mouse harboring a large human genomic sequence cloned in a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) that retained regulatory elements of the human genes.[6][7]  At Incyte Genomics, she discovered the value of combining knowledge of genomics and bioinformatics with knowledge of stem cell biology.   Loring founded Arcos Bioscience in 1997 in part to work on human embryonic stem cells and derived nine of the human embryonic stem cell preparations that were approved for federal funding by President George W. Bush in 2001.[8][9][10]/nThe Wisconsin Alumni Foundation (WARF) was issued a patent in 2001 that covered all human embryonic stem cells, and because of high patent licensing fees, Arcos decided to merge with another small company, Cythera,[11] which then merged with another stem cell company, Bresagen.[12] After another merger with Novocell, the company became Viacyte,[13] which was acquired by Vertex in 2022[14] for its experience in development of stem cell-derived therapies for Type 1 Diabetes. The initiation in 2003 of federal funding for human embryonic stem cells made Dr. Loring eligible to receive National Institutes of Health funding, and she was awarded a grant to provide the first West coast training course for hESC research.[15] Loring moved to academia, becoming the founding co-director of the Stem Cell Center at the Burnham Institute (now called the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute)./nIn 2006, Dr. Loring initiated a challenge of the WARF patents on hESCs[16] with Dan Ravicher, who founded the Public Patent Foundation and John Simpson from Consumer Watchdog. In response, the US Patent Office rejected the patents, leading WARF to narrow its claims; the PTO reversed its ruling and allowed the modified patent. The modification meant that WARF's patent now covered only embryo-derived stem cells, and excluded iPSCs, an important victory for the stem cell field. In 2014, the Supreme Court declined to take up the case (https://www.kpbs.org/news/science-technology/2015/02/25/san-diego-scientists-stem-cell-patent-challenge-st,) and the primary patent expired in 2015./nIn 2007, Loring was recruited to The Scripps Research Institute, where she was the founding director of the Center for Regenerative Medicine and Professor in the Department of Molecular Medicine.[17] In 2019, she moved her lab and research projects to Aspen Neuroscience, a biotechnology company she founded in 2018 with her postdoctoral fellow, Andres Bratt-Leal.[18] Aspen was founded to bring forward translational research to clinical utility.[19] She was Chief Scientific Officer at Aspen,[20] and remains at Scripps as a professor emerita.[21]  She was also an adjunct professor in human genetics at Sanford Burnham Prebys Institute, and remains an Adjunct Professor in the School of Public Health at San Diego State University, and Research Fellow at the Zoological Society of San Diego./nHer research is currently focused on human pluripotent stem cells, a remarkable cell type made by reprogramming adult cells to an embryonic state, making them capable of developing into all of the cell types in the body.  She has published over 200 peer-reviewed scientific articles, which have been cited more than 16,000 times.[22] She holds 5 issued patents on transgenic methods, Alzheimer disease, and stem cells.[23]/nLoring is an advocate for patient education and against stem cell tourism, and has frequently spoken out on these subjects[24] including commentaries in ethics journals with bioethicist Mary Devereaux.[25][26] She has also commented on the ethics of stem cell research in articles with ethicist Jonathan Moreno[27] and pro-life advocate Christine Scheller.[28]  She often guest blogs on the stem cell blog, The Niche, describing her experiences, such as attending an FDA public meeting on Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease.[29] For her outspoken support of patients and advocacy of stem cell research she was awarded the Stem Cell Person of the Year award in 2015 [30] and received the Stem Cell Action Advocacy Award in 2015 from the Genetics Policy Institute, which hosts the World Stem Cell Summit,[31] and won a Stem Cell Pioneer award from Xconomy in 2019.[32]/nGenomics and epigenetics/nA major theme of the research that Loring oversees is focused on the study of genomics and epigenetics of pluripotent stem cells, with the goal of ensuring their effectiveness and safety for cell therapy. Loring oversaw the development of PluriTest, an animal-free, molecular test of pluripotency that uses gene expression profiling to predict pluripotency of novel cell lines.[33] The patent on PluriTest is licensed for microarrays to ThermoFisher and was assigned to Aspen Neuroscience in 2019.[34] She has also done analysis of genomic integrity of cells in culture, and a comparative analysis the mutational loads of different reprogramming methods.[35]/nParkinson's disease cell replacement therapy/nSymptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease are caused by the death of dopamine neurons in a part of the brain called the substantia nigra. Aspen Neuroscience is developing a dopamine neuron replacement therapy for Parkinson's disease.[36] The project was launched in 2012 by funding by the patient advocacy group Summit For Stem Cell.[37] The goal of the project is to produce autologous (patient-specific) dopaminergic neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for use as a cell replacement therapy. The approach of using autologous cells ensures that they will not be rejected after transplantation. The project is notable for the high level of community involvement, including fundraisers, lab tours, and community education.[38]/nMultiple sclerosis therapy development/nAnother project in Dr. Loring\u2019s lab is development based therapy for multiple sclerosis. In a collaboration with Tom Lane, a notable MS researcher, a type of human neural precursor cell derived from pluripotent stem cells restored motor function in a mouse model of MS.[39][40] The transplanted cells do not permanently engraft within the mouse but the recovery process continues for several months before stabilizing.  The goal of this research is to identify the mechanism by which the human cells induced recovery from paralysis in the mouse. This knowledge is to be used to develop a novel evidence-based therapy for MS./nAutism/nFragile X syndrome is a genetic form of autism, and Loring's laboratory is using iPSCs derived from Fragile X patients to understand the causes of the disease. The goal of this research is to understand how autism affects brain development. Because the project uses iPSCs that are developed into the neurons affected in autism, the work has the potential to lead to identification of drugs to treat Fragile X and autism.[41]/nThe Stem Cell Zoo/nLoring and her postdoctoral fellow, Inbar Friedrich Ben-Nun, were the first to report the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from endangered species.[42] IPSCs were generated from a primate, the drill Mandrillus leucophaeus and the nearly extinct northern white rhinoceros, Ceratotherium simum cottoni. There are only two northern white rhinos left in the world (2022), and the hope is that the iPSCs can be differentiated into sperm and egg cells to generate new animals. \"If everything falls into place and everything works, there is a way to generate new animals,\" said Loring in an interview with Nature News.[43] The project is a collaboration with The Frozen Zoo at the San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research, which has collected and frozen samples from thousands of animals, including twelve northern white rhinos, in The Frozen Zoo. \u201cIt\u2019s really brilliant in retrospect that when animals die, you can freeze some of their cells and they\u2019ll last forever,\u201d said Loring.[44] In December 2015, an expert meeting was convened in Vienna, Austria, \"Conservation by cellular technologies\" where a plan was devised to rescue the northern white rhino[45] and their paper was published detailing this plan.[46] The story of her involvement in this project was published in a special Nature Outlook edition in 2021./nStem Cells in Space/nDr. Loring is involved in a project to study the effects of microgravity on neurons on the International Space Station (ISS). Supported by the National Stem Cell Foundation and in collaboration with the New York Stem Cell Foundation, the team has sent neural-glial organoids to the ISS on four missions: SpaceX CRS-18, CRS-19, CRS-24, and CRS-25.  The neurons survived and thrived for 30 days on the ISS. Early analysis suggests that there are unexpected changes caused by microgravity.  On CRS-25, Loring's own iPSC-derived neurons were sent to the ISS and returned in September 2022.  The team is analyzing the data from these missions./nLoring has received many awards, including a Rosalind Franklin Society Science Award (2022), American Physiological Society Solomon Berson Distinguished Lectureship (2022), the 2019 Xconomy Stem Cell Pioneer award, the 2015 Stem Cell Action Advocacy Award,[47] the 2015 Stem Cell Person of the Year,[48] a Millipore Foundation Stem Cell Research Award,[49] an Esther O'Keefe Foundation Award for Stem Cell Research, The Burnham Institute for Medical Research Leadership Award and the Marie and Jimmy Mayer Award for Melanoma Research.[50] She was a National Merit Scholar (1968) and was awarded a National Science Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship. She is a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and was inducted as an American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE) Fellow in 2021.  In 2017, she was invited to join an international group of researchers working toward development of cell replacement therapies for Parkinson's disease, called  G-Force PD.[51]/nLoring lives in Del Mar, California (2022) and is married to her lifelong partner and fellow scientist David L. Barker, former Chief Scientific Officer of the genomics biotechnology company Illumina, Inc (ILMN), founder of Singular Genomics (OMIC), and chair of the BOD of BioNano Genomics (BNGO). Dr. Barker received the Director Lifetime Achievement Award in 2022 from the Corporate Directors Forum.  Loring and Barker enjoy traveling and often travel to wherever in the world has the best viewing of total solar eclipses,[52] including Libya, Zambia, Aruba, Easter Island, Bolivia, Russia, Turkey, Indonesia, the US, and Australia. Loring has experienced 17 eclipses.[53] Fourteen were total, in which the moon completely eclipsed the sun for up to 5 minutes, and 3 were annular, in which the moon covered all but the edges of the sun.  She has logged a total time in the darkness of the totally eclipsed sun of more than 45 minutes.[54]", "63091229": "Lucy Collinson is a microbiologist, electron microscopist and scientist working at the Francis Crick Institute in London.[1] She is the head of electron microscopy./nIn 1998, Collinson completed a PhD in molecular microbiology at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry./n/nThis article about an English scientist is a stub.

In 2001, J. K. Rowling wrote a real-version of fictional textbook under the pseudonym \"Newt Scamander\". In the film series inspired by the book, Newt Scamander is the main character and is portrayed by Eddie Redmayne./nNewt Scamander is an introverted British wizard and magizoologist. His help is often sought by his former professor Albus Dumbledore in the mission to defeat the dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald. Newt ends up playing a vital role in the downfall of Grindelwald, during which Newt meets and falls in love with his future wife Tina./nRedmayne's portrayal of the character received mixed reactions from critics./nDescribing Newt as an outsider, Rowling said, \"My heroes are always people who feel themselves to be set apart, stigmatised or othered. That's at the heart of most of what I write, and it's certainly at the heart of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.[1]/nNewt Scamander grows attached to magical beasts since childhood and eventually becomes a magizoologist.[2] He feels extremely connected to all his magical creatures and beasts, and always defends them.[3]/nPresumably, Rowling created the character's name by combining terms related to animals \u2014 The nickname \"Newt\" is the name of a kind of salamander. The first middle name \"Artemis\" is the name of the Greek goddess of hunt, wilderness and wild animals. The second middle name \"Fido\" literally means \"I trust\" in Latin, highlighting the fact that Newt Scamander is in Hufflepuff, the Hogwarts house of loyalty; \"Fido\" is also a common name for a pet dog. The last name \"Scamander\" sounds a lot like \"Salamander\" which are amphibians in real life but are small fire-dwelling lizards in the wizarding world.[4]/nHarry Potter and Newt Scamander are rather different kinds of protagonists; Harry was reckless, daring and short-tempered at times; Newt usually remained calm and cool. Harry was a born leader and made lifelong, unbreakable friendships at Hogwarts; Newt was a loner and always thought of himself to be alone because his one close friendship with Leta Lestrange ended due to \"rocky circumstances\".[5] However, Newt and Harry share similar traits also, as they were both brave, humble, loyal, protector of underdogs, at odds with the Ministry of Magic, and both fought for the right thing. Both Harry and Newt were \"chosen\" to fight evils; Harry was chosen by his fate (and convinced by Dumbledore), and an extremely reluctant Newt was also convinced by Dumbledore to fight Grindelwald.[6]/nNewt is also somewhat similar to Hermione Granger as both of them are intelligent, deductive and crusaders, with \"extraordinary luggage\".[7]/nBorn in England[8] on 24 February 1897,[9] Newt Scamander developed interest towards magical beasts and creatures from a young age as his mother bred hippogriffs. Sorted into Hufflepuff at Hogwarts at the age of eleven,[8] Newt develops a close friendship with a Slytherin girl named Leta Lestrange, who is in the same year as him and shares both his interest in magical beasts and his inferiority complex due to being an outsider. Newt and Leta explore magical creatures together and enjoy each other's company, gradually falling in love. One of Leta's experiments involving a Jarvey accidentally endangers human life. Newt takes the blame for Leta's actions and is expelled from Hogwarts instead of her.[10] Therefore, Newt turns bitter towards Leta but still remains much in love with her.[11] Albus Dumbledore, Newt's Defence Against the Dark Arts professor at that time, strongly argues on his beloved student's behalf. Newt is still expelled but is allowed to keep his wand because of Dumbledore's influence./nAround 1914 to 1918, Newt serves on the Eastern front during the First World War in a confidential Ministry of Magic program involving Ukrainian Ironbelly dragons. However, the program is cancelled as the dragons respond only to Newt, whilst trying to eat all others. Newt later joins the Ministry[12] and receives several promotions there due to his knowledge about magical creatures, eventually becoming a magizoologist. However, Newt's career choice is not appreciated by his family. In 1918, Newt is convinced by Augustus Worme to use his extensive knowledge about magical beasts to write a book on them. Newt begins to travel internationally to conduct research on magical beasts and creatures for his book./nIn 1926,[13] Newt Scamander makes a brief stop over in New York with the motive of releasing Frank the Thunderbird into its habitat. Newt carries with him a magically expanded suitcase in which he carries several magical beasts from his voyage around the world.[14] In a chain of chaotic events, Newt's suitcase is accidentally switched with the suitcase of Muggle (or No-maj) aspiring baker Jacob Kowalski; Jacob opens the suitcase and accidentally lets out the magical beasts. Newt teams up with Jacob, American ex-auror Porpentina \"Tina\" Goldstein, and Tina's Legilimens sister Queenie, to round up all the escaped creatures. Newt faces complications from MACUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America) but nonetheless succeeds in rounding up all the escaped creatures with Jacob, Tina and Queenie's help. When Queenie learns of Newt's past through her Legillimency, she advises him to move on, describing Leta Lestrange as a \"taker\".[15]/nNewt encounters a destructive and emotionally disturbed obscurial teenager Credence Barebone, whom Newt comforts and consoles with his kindness. When MACUSA aurors attack Credence and presumably kill him, Newt is the only one who notices that a tiny wisp of the obscurus flees (implying that Credence survived). Newt exposes that MACUSA auror Percival Graves is the infamous and dangerous dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald in disguise; Grindelwald is arrested. Newt prevents the exposure of wizarding world to the No-maj community by using his thunderbird to disperse a potion which removes all the No-maj's memories about the Obscurial battle. Newt receives respect and apology from MACUSA. Newt bids Jacob an emotional farewell before the latter willingly steps into the rain of obliviating potion.[16] Newt argues on Tina's behalf and justifies her mistake because of which she had been fired; thereafter, Tina gets back her job as an auror. A week later, Newt anonymously gifts Jacob some silver Occamy shells to help him sanction a loan and fulfill his dream of opening a bakery.[17] Newt bids farewell to Tina and promises to deliver a copy of his book to her in person, before he boards a ship to England and leaves.[18]/nIn 1927,[13] Newt Scamander's book Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them has become a bestseller and an approved Hogwarts textbook. In the meantime, Grindelwald has escaped custody.[19] Albus Dumbledore secretly meets Newt and asks him to track and save Credence (now known by everyone to be alive).[20] Newt is disappointed to learn from Queenie that Tina is dating someone after mistakenly thinking that Newt is engaged to Leta Lestrange, whereas Leta is actually engaged to Newt's elder brother Theseus.[21] Learning that Tina is also searching for Credence in Paris, Newt goes there as well with Jacob (who has regained memories about the wizarding world. Due to an international travel ban placed on him by the Ministry, Newt bribes a Portkey tout and illegally reaches Paris with Jacob.[22] Both follow a wizard named Yusuf Kama, only to find Tina being held hostage by Kama. Unexpectedly, Kama faints due to an eye parasite and Newt frees himself, Jacob and Tina./nNewt and Tina infiltrate the French Ministry of Magic to uncover information about Credence's past. Eventually, Newt tells Tina that he is not engaged to Leta. He awkwardly tries to confess to Tina that he has fallen in love with her but nervously blurts that she has \"the eyes of a salamander\", leaving Tina crestfallen.[23] At the Lestrange family tomb, as Leta comes clean about a past mistake of hers to protect Credence from Yusuf Kama, Newt consoles a remorseful Leta as a good friend. Newt chooses to join the fight against Grindelwald after a destructive rally of Grindelwald's followers, during which Queenie and Credence join Grindelwald under manipulation, while Leta sacrifices her life to save others. At Hogwarts, Newt presents Dumbledore with a vial stolen from Grindelwald by Newt's niffler, containing a blood pact Grindelwald and Dumbledore made in their youth that prevents them from dueling each other; Dumbledore believes it can be destroyed.[24]/nIn 1932, Newt Scamander nurses a pregnant Qilin, who births twins. Grindelwald's acolytes kill the mother Qilin and capture one of the twins, whom Grindelwald slaughters to gain precognition. However, Newt saves the younger Qilin twin and keeps him safe.[25]/nAlbus Dumbledore entrusts Newt to form and lead a group to thwart Grindelwald's plans of world domination. Newt forms a team consisting of his auror brother Theseus, Muggle friend Jacob Kowalski, Ilvermorny Charms professor Eulalie \"Lally\" Hicks, his assistant Bunty and Yusuf Kama.[26] Newt presents Jacob with a wand as per Dumbledore's orders, much to Jacob's surprise and joy.[27] Newt, Jacob, Lally and Theseus are all shocked when Grindelwald is acquitted of all charges and is also allowed to stand in the upcoming election as a candidate. After Theseus is stunned and abducted by Grindelwald's acolytes, Newt infiltrates German prison Erkstag and rescues his brother. At Hog's head, Dumbledore reveals to Newt that Credence Barebone is actually the illegitimate son of his younger brother Aberforth Dumbledore. Newt attempts to comfort a guilt-ridden Dumbledore but in vain. However before leaving, Newt tells Dumbledore that he has a chance to correct his mistakes.[28]/nNewt, Theseus, Jacob, Lally, Bunty and Dumbledore reach Bhutan where the election for the new supreme mugwump is held. Grindelwald manipulates the election and deceitfully wins. But with Credence's help, Newt exposes that the Qilin which chose Grindelwald was already dead, reanimated through necromancy.[29] Newt releases the remaining alive Qilin, which chooses Vic\u00eancia Santos as the new Supreme Mugwump. Enraged and defeated, Grindelwald flees, but not before his and Dumbledore's blood pact is broken in a chain of spells.[29] Dumbledore sincerely thanks Newt for all his help; Aberforth accepts a dying Credence and takes him home. As Queenie regrets joining Grindelwald and renounces the dark side, she and Jacob marry. Newt attends the wedding as Jacob's best man. Newt is gladdened and rendered speechless to see his love-interest Tina there as well. The two reunite and attend the wedding together.[30]/nAt some time after the end of the Global Wizarding War, Newt and Tina marry.[31] Newt creates the Werewolf Register and the Ban on Experimental Breeding. Newt also works for the Dragon Research and Restraint Bureau.[31] In 1979, he is awarded The Order of Merlin - Second Class for his services to magizoology.[32] A Chocolate Frog Card is named after him.[33] His grandson Rolf Scamander\u2014a naturalist by profession\u2014goes on to marry Luna Lovegood.[34] Soon, Newt becomes the great-grandfather of twins Lorcan and Lysander./nAs depicted in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Newt Scamander visits Hogwarts in 1993 or 1994 for some unknown reason, thus appearing on the Marauder's Map.[35] Newt writes A Children's Anthology of Monsters, an edition for younger readers. As of 2017, Newt Scamander is still \"alive and well\".[31]/nThe character received mixed reaction. Newt Scamander was chosen by IGN as their fifteenth favourite Harry Potter character, saying that Newt has very quickly established himself as a \"very different sort of hero\".[36]/nCultural critic Jonathan McIntosh praised the character, stating that he \"performs a refreshingly atypical form of masculinity.\"[37] Joshua Hansen from MuggleNet liked Newt Scamander more than Harry Potter and said, \"Don't get me wrong, Harry is still dear to my heart [...] But when ranking whom I prefer, the man with the lizard [sic] for a name definitely takes the cake.\"[38] An editor from Looper approved of how Newt's character helped the Hufflepuff house to \"step into the limelight\".[39] Reviewer from The Guardian enjoyed Newt Scamander's personality and said, \"All pigeon-toed angles and stuttering rushes of enthusiasm, [Eddie Redmayne's] great gift to the character is a crippling diffidence.\"[40]/nEddie Redmayne, the actor who portrayed Newt Scamander throughout the films, also received positive reception. For his role in Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them, Redmayne received the Best Actor Award from Empire Awards.[41]/nMany critics disapproved of Redmayne interpretation of the character. Helen O'Hara from Empire wrote, \"[...] he's so disconnected and withdrawn that he barely shifts facial expression from friendly blankness for the first half hour, when we really need him to guide us around.\"[42] Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times described Newt Scamander as \"charmless\".[43] Charles Bramesco of Polygon criticised how Newt Scamander has \"been remanded to the margins of his own franchise\".[44]/nNewt Scamander is a tall wizard with brown hair and hazel eyes./nNewt almost always wears his single-breasted, close-fitting, peacock blue overcoat, which covers his body down to his knees. Newt's primary dressing-manner also includes his dark brown suit jacket and trousers, burnt-orange waistcoat, ivory-white shirt, small bow tie and calf high leather boots which are weather-beaten and worn from his travels across the world.[45] The various pockets in Newt's coat contain various potions and elixirs for Newt as a magizoologist always remains prepared./nOccasionally, he is also seen wearing his woollen black-and-yellow Hufflepuff scarf./nEddie Redmayne expressed his thoughts about Newt Scamander possibly being on the autism spectrum.[46] Socially awkward, slightly eccentric and introverted around humans, Newt feels more comfortable around animals and connects better with them.[47] Newt's relationships with his magical beasts sometimes takes precedence over his relationships with other human beings. However, Newt does not lack empathy towards humans as his beliefs about the power of Muggles and his remarkable friendship with Muggle Jacob Kowalski \"mirrors a certain Albus Dumbledore\".[1]/nNewt is not afraid to show weakness, vulnerability or emotions. He attempts to avoid violence when possible, such as when he consoles the violently disturbed obscurial Credence Barebone by his kind, understanding and sympathetic nature.[1] Newt is praised by his former headmaster Albus Dumbledore for always doing the right thing without seeking power or glory.[48]/nNewt has a scientist's eye and the thirst for knowledge about magical creatures, with the motive of protecting them and educating others about them. Newt \"bumbles\" into the heart of danger, especially if a mysterious species is involved. Newt is fascinated by all sorts of magical creatures\u2014those by which wizards and witches are deeply terrified.[49]/nNewt's expertise in Charms is seen as he is able to perform a highly-advanced Undetectable Extension Charm on the interior of his suitcase to expand the space within and hold innumerable magical creatures of different native habitats.[50] He is also able to cast Atmospheric Charms to create separate natural habitats inside the suitcase for the magical beasts to survive. He is even able to create a magical bubble to contain and sustain an obscurus even after the death of its host.[51] He could also successfully use a tracking spell, which he used to trace Tina./nNewt is particularly gifted in Herbology and Healing as he is capable of preparing medicinal remedies from magical plants and potions\u2014such as when he swiftly creates a poultice through plants and contents of various bottles to control Jacob's severe reaction to a Murtlap bite.[52] Newt also looked after magical flora and was familiar with their properties, keeping several potted plants on a shelf in his shed in the magically expanded suitcase./nPolyjuice Potion is regarded as highly difficult to make.[53] Since Newt was successfully able to brew the potion,[54]\u00a0it suggests that he is skilled in potion-making as well./nNewt Scamander's wand is made up of rather unusual contents: The wood of the wand is of Tropical Lime Tree, while shell and bone are used as cores of the wand.[12] Newt's boggart is an office desk, because what he fears most is having to work in an office.[55] When Rowling was asked by a fan regarding the form of Newt's patronus, she left it unrevealed for suspense.[56]/nIn the film series, Newt Scamander is portrayed by Eddie Redmayne.[57] Both J. K. Rowling and David Heyman stated that Eddie Redmayne was their \"first and only choice\" for portraying Newt Scamander. \"Not only does he look as if he lives in 1926, but he has all the elements required to be Newt: he's smart, funny, utterly British, and immensely sympathetic [...]\" said David Heyman.[58][59]/nRedmayne chose the character's wand himself from a number of different designs because he loved that it was \"very simple\" and \"made of organic materials\".[60] Redmayne took the Patronus quiz on Pottermore twice and both times got the same result: a Basset Hound patronus.[61]/nDuring Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, a teenaged Newt Scamander is portrayed by British child artist Joshua Shea.[62]", "275026": "Robert Rosen (June 27, 1934 \u2013 December 28, 1998) was an American theoretical biologist and Professor of Biophysics at Dalhousie University.[1]/nRosen was born on June 27, 1934, in Brownsville (a section of Brooklyn), in New York City. He studied biology, mathematics, physics, philosophy, and history; particularly, the history of science. In 1959 he obtained a PhD in relational biology, a specialization within the broader field of Mathematical Biology, under the guidance of Professor Nicolas Rashevsky at the University of Chicago. He remained at the University of Chicago until 1964,[2] later moving to the University of Buffalo \u2014 now part of the State University of New York (SUNY) \u2014 at Buffalo on a full associate professorship, while holding a joint appointment at the Center for Theoretical Biology./nHis year-long sabbatical in 1970 as a visiting fellow at Robert Hutchins' Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions in Santa Barbara, California was seminal, leading to the conception and development of what he later called Anticipatory Systems Theory, itself a corollary of his larger theoretical work on relational complexity. In 1975, he left SUNY at Buffalo and accepted a position at Dalhousie University, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, as a Killam Research Professor in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics, where he remained until he took early retirement in 1994.[3] He is survived by his wife, a daughter, Judith Rosen, and two sons./nHe served as president of the Society for General Systems Research, now known as the International Society for the Systems Sciences (ISSS), in 1980-81./nRosen's research was concerned with the most fundamental aspects of biology, specifically the questions \"What is life?\" and \"Why are living organisms alive?\". A few of the major themes in his work were:/nRosen believed that the contemporary model of physics - which he showed to be based on a Cartesian and Newtonian formalism suitable for describing a world of mechanisms - was inadequate to explain or describe the behavior of biological systems. Rosen argued that the fundamental question \"What is life?\" cannot be adequately addressed from within a scientific foundation that is reductionistic. Approaching organisms with reductionistic scientific methods and practices sacrifices the functional organization of living systems in order to study the parts. The whole, according to Rosen, could not be recaptured once the biological organization had been destroyed. By proposing a sound theoretical foundation for studying biological organisation, Rosen held that, rather than biology being a mere subset of the already known physics, it might turn out to provide profound lessons for physics, and also for science in general.[4]/nRosen's work combines sophisticated mathematics with potentially radical new views on the nature of living systems and science. He has been called \"the Newton of biology.\"[5] Drawing on set theory, his work has also been considered controversial, raising concerns that some of the mathematical methods he used could lack adequate proof. Rosen's posthumous work Essays on Life Itself (2000) as well as recent monographs[6][7] by Rosen's student Aloisius Louie have clarified and explained the mathematical content of Rosen's work./nRosen's work proposed a methodology which needs to be developed in addition to the current reductionistic approaches to science by molecular biologists. He called this methodology Relational Biology. Relational is a term he correctly attributes to his mentor Nicolas Rashevsky, who published several papers on the importance of set-theoretical relations[8] in biology prior to Rosen's first reports on this subject. Rosen's relational approach to Biology is an extension and amplification of Nicolas Rashevsky's treatment of n-ary relations in, and among, organismic sets that he developed over two decades as a representation of both biological and social \"organisms\"./nRosen's relational biology maintains that organisms, and indeed all systems, have a distinct quality called organization which is not part of the language of reductionism, as for example in molecular biology, although it is increasingly employed in systems biology. It has to do with more than purely structural or material aspects. For example, organization includes all relations between material parts, relations between the effects of interactions of the material parts, and relations with time and environment, to name a few. Many people sum up this aspect of complex systems[9] by saying that the whole is more than the sum of the parts. Relations between parts and between the effects of interactions must be considered as additional 'relational' parts, in some sense./nRosen said that organization must be independent from the material particles which seemingly constitute a living system. As he put it:/nThe human body completely changes the matter it is made of roughly every 8 weeks, through metabolism, replication and repair. Yet, you're still you --with all your memories, your personality... If science insists on chasing particles, they will follow them right through an organism and miss the organism entirely./nRosen's abstract relational biology approach focuses on a definition of living organisms, and all complex systems, in terms of their internal organization as open systems that cannot be reduced to their interacting components because of the multiple relations between metabolic, replication and repair components that govern the organism's complex biodynamics./nHe deliberately chose the `simplest' graphs and categories for his representations of Metabolism-Repair Systems in small categories of sets endowed only with the discrete \"efficient\" topology of sets, envisaging this choice as the most general and less restrictive. It turns out however that the efficient entailments of \n\n\n\n(\nM\n\n,\n\nR\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (M{,}R)}\n\nsystems  are \"closed to efficient cause\",[10] or in simple terms the catalysts (\"efficient causes\" of metabolism, usually identified as enzymes) are themselves products of metabolism, and thus may not be considered, in a strict mathematical sense, as subcategories of the category of sequential machines or automata: in direct contradiction of the French philosopher Descartes' supposition that all animals are only elaborate machines or mechanisms. Rosen stated: \"I argue that the only resolution to such problems [of the subject-object boundary and what constitutes objectivity] is in the recognition that closed loops of causation are 'objective'; i.e. legitimate objects of scientific scrutiny. These are explicitly forbidden in any machine or mechanism.\"[11] Rosen's demonstration of \"efficient closure\" was to present this clear paradox in mechanistic science, that on the one hand organisms are defined by such causal closures and on the other hand mechanism forbids them; thus we need to revise our understanding of nature. The mechanistic view prevails even today in most of general biology, and most of science, although some claim no longer in sociology and psychology where reductionist approaches have failed and fallen out of favour since the early 1970s. However those fields have yet to reach consensus on what the new view should be, as is also the case in most other disciplines, which struggle to retain various aspects of \"the machine metaphor\" for living and complex systems./nThe clarification of the distinction between simple and complex scientific models became in later years a major goal of Rosen's published reports. Rosen maintained that modeling is at the very essence of science and thought. His book Anticipatory Systems[12] describes, in detail, what he termed the modeling relation. He showed the deep differences between a true modeling relation and a simulation, the latter not based on such a modeling relation./nIn mathematical biology he is known as the originator of a class of relational models of living organisms, called \n\n\n\n(\nM\n\n,\n\nR\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (M{,}R)}\n\nsystems that he devised to capture the minimal capabilities that a material system would need in order to be one of the simplest functional organisms that are commonly said to be \"alive\". In this kind of system, \n\n\n\nM\n\n\n{\\displaystyle M}\n\n stands for the metabolic and \n\n\n\nR\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R}\n\n stands for the 'repair' subsystems of a simple organism, for example active 'repair' RNA molecules. Thus, his mode for determining or \"defining\" life in any given system is a functional, not material, mode; although he did consider in his 1970s published reports specific dynamic realizations of the simplest \n\n\n\n(\nM\n\n,\n\nR\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (M{,}R)}\n\nsystems in terms of enzymes (\n\n\n\nM\n\n\n{\\displaystyle M}\n\n), RNA (\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R}\n\n), and functional, duplicating DNA (his \n\n\n\n\u03b2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\beta }\n\n-mapping)./nHe went, however, even further in this direction by claiming that when studying a complex system, one \"can throw away the matter and study the organization\" to learn those things that are essential to defining in general an entire class of systems. This has been, however, taken too literally by a few of his former students who have not completely assimilated Robert Rosen's injunction of the need for a theory of dynamic realizations of such abstract components in specific molecular form in order to close the modeling loop[clarification needed] for the simplest functional organisms (such as, for example, single-cell algae or microorganisms).[13] He supported this claim (that he actually attributed to Nicolas Rashevsky) based on the fact that living organisms are a class of systems with an extremely wide range of material \"ingredients\", different structures, different habitats, different modes of living and reproduction, and yet we are somehow able to recognize them all as living, or functional organisms, without being however vitalists./nHis approach, just like Rashevsky's latest theories of organismic sets,[14][15] emphasizes biological organization over molecular structure in an attempt to bypass the structure-functionality relationships that are important to all experimental biologists, including physiologists. In contrast, a study of the specific material details of any given organism, or even of a type of organisms, will only tell us about how that type of organism \"does it\". Such a study doesn't approach what is common to all functional organisms, i.e. \"life\". Relational approaches to theoretical biology would therefore allow us to study organisms in ways that preserve those essential qualities that we are trying to learn about, and that are common only to functional organisms./nRobert Rosen's approach belongs conceptually to what is now known as Functional Biology, as well as Complex Systems Biology, albeit in a highly abstract, mathematical form./nRosen also questioned what he believed to be many aspects of mainstream interpretations of biochemistry and genetics. He objects to the idea that functional aspects in biological systems can be investigated via a material focus. One example: Rosen disputes that the functional capability of a biologically active protein can be investigated purely using the genetically encoded sequence of amino acids. This is because, he said, a protein must undergo a process of folding to attain its characteristic three-dimensional shape before it can become functionally active in the system. Yet, only the amino acid sequence is genetically coded. The mechanisms by which proteins fold are not completely known. He concluded, based on examples such as this, that phenotype cannot always be directly attributed to genotype and that the chemically active aspect of a biologically active protein relies on more than the sequence of amino acids, from which it was constructed: there must be some other important factors at work, that he did not however attempt to specify or pin down./nCertain questions about Rosen's mathematical arguments were raised in a paper authored by Christopher Landauer and Kirstie L. Bellman[16] which claimed that some of the mathematical formulations used by Rosen are problematic from a logical viewpoint. It is perhaps worth noting, however, that such issues were also raised long time ago by Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead in their famous Principia Mathematica in relation to antinomies of set theory. As Rosen's mathematical formulation in his earlier papers was also based on set theory and the category of sets such issues have naturally re-surfaced. However, these issues have now been addressed by Robert Rosen in his recent book Essays on Life Itself, published posthumously in 2000. Furthermore, such basic problems of mathematical formulations of \n\n\n\n(\nM\n\n,\n\nR\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (M{,}R)}\n\n--systems had already been resolved by other authors as early as 1973 by utilizing the Yoneda lemma in category theory, and the associated functorial construction in categories with (mathematical) structure.[17][18] Such general category-theoretic extensions of \n\n\n\n(\nM\n\n,\n\nR\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (M{,}R)}\n\n-systems that avoid set theory paradoxes are based on William Lawvere's categorical approach and its extensions to higher-dimensional algebra. The mathematical and logical extension of  metabolic-replication systems to generalized \n\n\n\n(\nM\n\n,\n\nR\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (M{,}R)}\n\n-systems, or G-MR, also involved a series of acknowledged letters exchanged between Robert Rosen and the latter authors during 1967\u20141980s, as well as letters exchanged with Nicolas Rashevsky up to 1972./nRosen's ideas are becoming increasingly accepted in theoretical biology, and there are several current discussions.[19][20][21][22]  One of his main results, as explained in his book Life Itself (1991), was the unexpected conclusion that (M,R) systems cannot be simulated by Turing machines./nErwin Schr\u00f6dinger discussed issues of quantum genetics in his famous book of 1945, What Is Life?

Nonetheless, there are more similarities than may be obvious at first sight, for example between G\u00e1nti and Rosen.[32] Until recently[33][34][35] there have been almost no attempts to compare the different theories and discuss them together./nSome authors equate models of the origin of life with LUCA, the Last Universal Common Ancestor of all extant life.[36]  This is a serious error resulting from failure to recognize that L refers to the last common ancestor, not to the first ancestor, which is much older: a large amount of evolution occurred before the appearance of LUCA.[37]/nGill and Forterre expressed the essential point as follows:[38]/nLUCA should not be confused with the first cell, but was the product of a long period of evolution.

The microorganisms in the environment are essentially carrying out oxidation and reduction reactions, namely, oxidation of the organic contaminant coupled to the reduction of inorganic electron acceptors. The mechanism by which these bacteria (mainly denitrifiers, iron reducers, sulfidogens and methanogens, respectively) degrade the contaminants is different from aerobic bacteria because they cannot use oxygen to activate the stable hydrocarbon molecules./nIn contrast to humans, these bacteria are not dependent on oxygen as an electron acceptor for cellular respiration, but use molecules like nitrate, iron, sulfate and carbonate.

He is known for his studies of the uses of plants by indigenous peoples, especially the indigenous peoples of the Americas. He worked on entheogenic or hallucinogenic plants, particularly in Mexico and the Amazon, involving lifelong collaborations with chemists. He had charismatic influence as an educator at Harvard University; several of his students and colleagues went on to write popular books and assume influential positions in museums, botanical gardens, and popular culture./nHis book The Plants of the Gods: Their Sacred, Healing, and Hallucinogenic Powers (1979), co-authored with chemist Albert Hofmann, the discoverer of LSD,  is considered his greatest popular work: it has never been out of print and was revised into an expanded second edition, based on a German translation by Christian R\u00e4tsch (1998), in 2001.[2]/nSchultes was born in Boston; his father was a plumber.[1] He grew up and was schooled in East Boston.[3] His interest in South American rain forests traced back to his childhood: while he was bedridden, his parents read him excerpts of Notes of a Botanist on the Amazon and the Andes, by 19th century English botanist Richard Spruce.[1]  He received a full scholarship to Harvard.[1]/nOn entering Harvard in 1933, Schultes planned to pursue medicine.  However that changed after he took Biology 104, \"Plants and Human Affairs,\" taught by orchidologist and Director of the Harvard Botanical Museum Oakes Ames.[3] Ames became a mentor, and Schultes became an assistant in the Botanical Museum; his undergraduate senior thesis studied the ritual use of peyote cactus among the Kiowa of Oklahoma, and he obtained BA in biology in 1937.[1][3] Continuing at Harvard under Ames, he completed his Master of Arts in biology in 1938 and his Ph.D. in botany in 1941. Schultes' doctoral thesis investigated the lost identity of the Mexican hallucinogenic plants teonan\u00e1catl (mushrooms belonging to the genus Psilocybe) and ololiuqui (a morning glory species) in Oaxaca, Mexico.[1]  He received a fellowship from the National Research Council to study the plants used to make curare.[3]/nThe entry of the United States into World War II saw Schultes diverted to the search for wild disease-resistant Hevea rubber species in an effort to free the United States from dependence on Southeast Asian rubber plantations which had become unavailable owing to Japanese occupation. In early 1942, as a field agent for the governmental Rubber Development Corporation, Schultes began work on rubber and concurrently undertook research on Amazonian ethnobotany, under a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship.[3]/nSchultes' botanical field-work among aboriginal American communities led him to be one of the first to alert the world about destruction of the Amazon rain-forest and the disappearance of its native people. He collected over thirty thousand herbarium specimens (including three hundred species new to Western science) and published numerous ethnobotanical discoveries including the source of the dart poison known as curare, now commonly employed as a muscle relaxant during surgery.[1] He was the first non-native individual to academically examine ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic brew made out of Banisteriopsis caapi vine in combination with various plants; of which he identified Psychotria viridis (Chacruna) and Diplopterys cabrerana (Chaliponga), both of which contained a potent short-acting hallucinogen, N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT).[4] In his travels he lived with the indigenous peoples and viewed them with respect and felt that tribal chiefs were gentlemen; he understood the languages of the Witoto and Makuna peoples.[1][3] He encountered dangers in his travels, including hunger, beriberi, repeated bouts of malaria, and near drowning.[3]/nSchultes became curator of Harvard's Oakes Ames Orchid Herbarium in 1953, curator of Economic Botany in 1958, and professor of biology in 1970.  His ever-popular undergraduate course on economic botany was noted for his Victorian demeanor, lectures delivered in a white lab coat, insistence on memorization of systematic botanical names, films depicting native ritual use of plant inebriants, blowgun demonstrations, and hands-on labs (using plant sources of grain, paper, caffeine, dyes, medicines, and tropical fruits). His composed and kindly persona and expressive eye gestures helped capture the imagination of the many students he inspired./nIn 1959, Schultes married Dorothy Crawford McNeil, an opera soprano who performed in Europe and the United States. They had three children, Richard Evans Schultes II, and twins Alexandra Ames Schultes Wilson and Neil Parker Schultes.[1] Schultes retired from Harvard in 1985.[1] He was a member of King's Chapel church in Boston.[3]  Despite his Germanic surname he was an anglophile.[3] He would often vote for the Queen of the United Kingdom during presidential elections because he didn't support the American Revolution.[5]/nSchultes was led to study psychoactive drugs by Heinrich Kluver, a leading scholar of this subject (personal communication from Schultes). This interest evolved by way of Schultes' field observations on peyote, studying the peyote cult among the Plains Indians in his travels with Weston LaBarre in the early 1930s (in 1938, LaBarre based The Peyote Cult on these travels and observations)./nIn Western culture, Schultes' discoveries influenced writers who considered hallucinogens as the gateways to self-discovery, such as Aldous Huxley, William Burroughs and Carlos Castaneda.[1][5] Although he contributed to the psychedelic era with his discoveries, he personally disdained its proponents, dismissing drug guru and fellow Harvard professor Timothy Leary for being so little versed in hallucinogenic species that he misspelled the Latin names of the plants.[1] When Burroughs described his ayahuasca visions as an earth-shaking metaphysical experience, Schultes famously replied, \"That's funny, Bill, all I saw was colors.\"[1][4][5]/nSchultes' personal hero was Richard Spruce, a British naturalist who spent seventeen years exploring the Amazon rainforest.[1]/nSchultes, in both his life and his work, has directly influenced notable people as diverse as biologist E.O.

Jameson is notable for his advanced scholarship, and his museum collection. The minerals and fossils collection of the Museum of Edinburgh University became one of the largest in Europe during Jameson's long tenure at the university./nJameson was born in Leith on 11 July 1774, the son of  Catherine Paton (1750\u201394) and Thomas Jameson (c.1750\u20131802), a soap manufacturer on Rotten Row (now Water Street).[1] They lived on Sherrif Brae. His early education was spent at Leith Grammar School, after which he became the apprentice of the Leith surgeon John Cheyne (father of John Cheyne), with the aim of going to sea. He made his first trip to Shetland to study its geology in 1789, aged only 15, publishing his findings in 1793.[2]/nHe attended classes at the University of Edinburgh (1792\u201393), studying medicine, botany, chemistry, and natural history. His father's brother Robert Jameson, was also a physician and lived with them on Rotten Row.[3]/nBy 1793, influenced by the Regius Professor of Natural History, John Walker (1731\u20131803), Jameson abandoned medicine and the idea of being a ship's surgeon, and focused instead on science, particularly geology and mineralogy. It is worth noting that Walker was a presbyterian Minister who had actually combined the Regius Professorship with a period of service as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1790./nIn 1793, Jameson was given the responsibility of looking after the University's Natural History Collection. During this time his geological field-work frequently took him to the Isle of Arran, the Hebrides, Orkney, the Shetland Islands and the Irish mainland. In 1800, he spent a year at the mining academy in Freiberg, Saxony, where he studied under the noted geologist Abraham Gottlob Werner (1749 or 1750\u20131817)./nAs an undergraduate, Jameson had several noteworthy classmates at the University of Edinburgh including Robert Brown, Joseph Black, and Thomas Dick./nIn 1799 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Andrew Coventry, Thomas Charles Hope and Andrew Duncan.[4]/nIn 1804, Jameson succeeded Dr Walker as the third Regius Professor of Natural History at the University of Edinburgh, a post which he held for fifty years. During this period he became the first eminent exponent in Britain of the Wernerian geological system, or Neptunism, and the acknowledged leader of the Scottish Wernerians, founding the Wernerian Natural History Society[5] in 1808 and presiding from 1808 until around 1850, when his health began to decline, together with the fortunes of the Society. Jameson's support for Neptunism, a theory that argued that all rocks had been deposited from a primaeval ocean, initially pitted him against James Hutton (1726\u20131797), a fellow Scot and eminent geologist also based in Edinburgh (but not in the university), who argued for the uniformitarian deistic concept of Plutonism, that features of the Earth's crust were endlessly recycled in natural processes powered by magmatic molten rocks./nLater, Jameson was willing to join forces with the proponents of Hutton, in 1826 writing that \"the Wernerian geognostical views and method of investigation, combined with the theory of Hutton; the experiments and speculations of Hall; the illustrations of Playfair\", had taken root in Edinburgh and spread to give Britain unsurpassed success in geology.[6]/nIn the April\u2013October 1826 edition of the quarterly Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal edited by Jameson, an anonymous paper praised \"Mr. Lamarck, one of the most sagacious naturalists of our day\" for having \"expressed himself in the most unambiguous manner. He admits, on the one hand, the existence of the simplest infusory animals; on the other, the existence of the simplest worms, by means of spontaneous generation, that is, by an aggregation process of animal elements; and maintains, that all other animals, by the operation of external circumstances, are evolved from these in a double series, and in a gradual manner.\"[7] \u2013 this was the first use of the word \"evolved\" in a modern sense,[8] and was the first significant statement to relate Lamarckism to the geological record of living organisms of the past.[9] Attribution has been disputed, the concepts point to Jameson as the author, combining the directional geological history of Earth proposed by Neptunism with progressive transformism (transmutation of species) shown by fossils. It is possible that the article was written by one of his students, Ami Bou\u00e9 or Robert Edmond Grant.[10][11] Jameson's references to the Deluge in notes to his translation of Georges Cuvier's Essay on the Theory of the Earth had done much to foster Catastrophism, but his 1827 edition referred to a \"succession of variations\" caused by environmental conditions having \"gradually conducted the classes of aquatic animals to their present state\".[10][12] and a later chapter described how \"like the formation of rocks, we observe a regular succession of organic formations, the later always descending from the earlier, down to the present inhabitants of the earth, and to the last created being who was to exercise dominion over them\", summarising elements of the ideas of Giambattista Brocchi.[12][13]/nAs a teacher, Jameson had a mixed reputation for imparting enthusiasm to his students. Thomas Carlyle, who gave serious attention to Natural History, described Jameson's lecturing style as a \"blizzard of facts\". Charles Darwin attended Robert Jameson's natural history course at the University of Edinburgh in Darwin's teenage years. Darwin found the lectures boring, saying that they determined him \"never to attend to the study of geology\". The detailed syllabus of Jameson's lectures, as drawn up by him in 1826, shows the range of his teaching. The course in zoology began with a consideration of the natural history of human beings, and concluded with lectures on the philosophy of zoology, in which the first subject was Origin of the Species of Animals. (The Scotsman, 29 October 1935: p.\u00a08)./nOver Jameson's fifty-year tenure, he built up a huge collection of mineralogical and geological specimens for the Museum of Edinburgh University, including fossils, birds and insects. By 1852 there were over 74,000 zoological and geological specimens at the museum, and in Britain the natural history collection was second only to that of the British Museum. Shortly after his death, the University Museum was transferred to the British Crown and became part of the Royal Scottish Museum, now the Royal Museum, in Edinburgh's Chambers Street. He was also a prolific author of scientific papers and books, including the Mineralogy of the Scottish Isles (1800), his System of Mineralogy (1804), which ran to three editions, and Manual of Mineralogy (1821). In 1819, with Sir David Brewster (1781\u20131868), Jameson started the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal[14] and became its sole editor in 1824./nHe died at his home, 21 Royal Circus in Edinburgh,[15] on 19 April 1854 after two years of illness, and was interred at Warriston Cemetery.[16] He lies on the north side of the main east\u2013west path near the old East Gate.

EPO was known to be produced by the kidneys in response to low oxygen levels, and Ratcliffe's work looked to understand the mechanisms of how the kidneys detected hypoxia (low oxygen levels in the blood) to trigger EPO production. From his studies, Ratcliffe discovered that the mRNA from kidneys that were part of the EPO production pathway that were capable of detecting hypoxia was also present in several other organs, both human and animal, including the spleen, brain, and testes.[18] His group found that cells from these organs could switch on EPO production when deprived of oxygen.[17] Further, Ratcliffe was able to modify other cells using the identified mRNA to give these cells oxygen-sensing capabilities.[18]/nBuilding on these discoveries, the Ratcliffe group, along with joint studies with William Kaelin and Gregg Semenza, helped to uncover a detailed molecular chain of events that cells use to sense oxygen. A specific step identified was the binding of proteins expressed by the Von Hippel\u2013Lindau tumor suppressor gene (VHL) to hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF), a transcription factor which trans-activates the EPO gene. Ratcliffe found that the VHL protein can bind a hydroxylated residues of HIF when oxygen is present at acceptable levels; the VHL protein then ubiquitylates the HIF protein which ultimately leads to the HIF protein's destruction. When oxygen levels fall, oxygen-requiring HIF hydroxylase enzymes, PHD1, 2 and 3 no longer act and VHL does not bind HIF, allowing HIF to remain and activate the EPO gene. This is a process that takes minutes to complete allowing the body to react quickly to hypoxia.[2]/nThis same pathway is also switched on in many cancer tumours, allowing them to create new blood vessels to sustain their growth. Much of the current understanding of hypoxia has emerged from the laboratory of Ratcliffe.[13] The understanding of the molecular pathway of EPO production from hypoxia has led to the development of drugs that block VHL from binding with HIF to help treat patients with anaemia and kidney failure.[2]/nRatcliffe married Fiona Mary MacDougall in 1983.[9]/nRatcliffe has received a number of awards, accolades, and honours for his seminal work on hypoxia./nHe was knighted in the 2014 New Year Honours for services to clinical medicine.[26]", "5419732": "A wildlife biologist studies animals and their behavior along with the role each animal plays in its natural habitat. The duties of a wildlife biologist can include: developing and conducting experiments/studies on animals in their natural habitats, studying the characteristics of animals such as their interaction with different species, their reproductive and movement patterns, the dynamic within a population, and the transmission of diseases.

It took ~2.5 years to sequence the 7.5 kilobases encompassing the entire rrnB rRNA operon in addition to some flanking regions.[3] Although the chemical method was cumbersome, sequences could be determined entirely void of errors.[4]/nDuring his stay at UCSC Brosius met visiting professor Carl Woese, who incited his interest in evolutionary thought and the power of molecular phylogenetic analysis./nHis second postdoctoral fellowship (1980\u20131982), supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgesellschaft, took him to the laboratory of Walter Gilbert, Nobel prize laureate in Chemistry (1980), at Harvard University. Here, Brosius began to develop plasmid vectors for the selection of promoters and terminators,[5][6] as well as widely used vectors for the high-level expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli, often employing regulatory sequences or modules from the rRNA operon.[7][8]/nIn 1982, Brosius established his own laboratory at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons as assistant professor partially funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation[9] and the Irma T. Hirschl Trust.[10] In 1988, he moved with his research group to Mount Sinai School of Medicine as Associate Professor and in 1994 as full Professor and Director of the Institute of Experimental Pathology to the University of M\u00fcnster, Germany. In the mid-nineties, he established a transgenic and gene targeting facility serving the entire campus and beyond by generating, for example, mouse models designed for the study of human genetic disorders.[11]/nIn the early 1980s, Brosius became interested in a small brain-specific RNA that was thought to be a waste product of a mechanism orchestrating the expression of genes by RNA polymerase III transcription of identifier sequence (ID) repetitive elements, classified as SINEs, short interspersed repeats, located in the introns of brain-specific genes by making chromatin  accessible to RNA polymerase II.[12] This attractive hypothesis was not tenable. Instead, the Brosius laboratory focused on this brain cytoplasmic BC1 RNA, cloned it as cDNA by developing a method for generating cDNA libraries based on non-polyadenylated RNAs, and isolated its single gene, which evolved from a retroposed copy of a transfer RNA (tRNAAla). It was shown that BC1 RNA is the source gene for ID repetitive elements in rodents, and his laboratory established that the dendritic localization of BC1 RNA in neurons[13][14][15] co-localizes with numerous components of the translation machinery.[16] Based on these findings, Brosius concluded as early as the eighties that:/n1.\tFunctional RNAs are not only fossils from a by-gone RNA world[17] but can arise de novo in modern cells and contribute to the functionality of a cell or organism; many more RNAs are yet to be discovered./n2.\tRetroposition (conversion of RNA to DNA) is an ancient process, but has persisted throughout the evolution of most eukaryotes. This process has contributed to the mass of genomes of modern multicellular organisms,[18] at the same time keeping genomes in flux and presenting raw material for the de novo evolution of genes.[19]/n3.\tRetroposition, not only segmental gene duplication, can also yield extra gene copies or smaller gene modules including regulatory elements for existing genes.[20][19][21]/nTogether with Stephen J. Gould, Brosius took the concept of exaptation to the genomic level.[22][23][24]/nEncouraged by the stimulating findings surrounding BC1 RNA, in the mid-nineties he emphasized the significance of RNA coding genes in association with genome projects[25] and embarked on generating more cDNA libraries based on non-protein coding RNAs from mice and various model organisms, ringing in the era of RNomics,[26][27][28]/nA number of small nucleolar RNAs prevalently expressed in the brain as well as imprinted (only expressed by one parental chromosome) were discovered in mice and men.[26][28]/nSeveral of these mapped to the human Prader-Willi Syndrome locus, a neurodevelopmental disorder. After the individual deletion of all protein coding gene candidates of this locus in mouse models by others,[29] the Brosius laboratory deleted the cluster of Snord116 snoRNA genes and the corresponding non-protein coding exons of the host gene. They observed some of the same phenotypes as the human disorder, such as failure to thrive and short stature, but not obesity later in life or infertility.[30] This was confirmed by an independent study.[31]/nEarlier, Brosius and coworkers demonstrated that mice lacking the BC1 RNA gene had deficiencies in exploratory behaviour in the laboratory and under semi-natural conditions.[32]/nIn addition to other RNomics discoveries, they were the first to demonstrate that certain tandem repeats were processed into CRISPR RNA units in Archaea.[33]/nBrosius remains a long-time advocate[34] for the significance and wealth of RNA molecules even in modern cells. Yet, he is skeptical of the drastic transformation in the perception of RNA within the scientific community. The idea of pervasive importance of RNA was formerly frequently rejected. Currently, the trend of thought is to raise any background transcript or any detectable snippet of a transcript after processing or decay to a functional status.[35][36][37][38][39]/nHe observed analogous trends in the field of repetitive or transposed genomic elements (TEs) including retroposed elements.[20] These elements were initially considered to be junk, littering genomes, and proposed by only a few to constitute raw material for fortuitous and only occasional exaptations,[40] and to be responsible for the plasticity of genomes and the modular architecture of genes.[19][41][40] The current tide is moving in the opposite direction.[42] A plethora of functions have been assigned to TEs, one example being the bewildering spectrum of tasks allocated to the evolutionarily young primate-specific Alu elements. Such sweeping interpretations should be challenged.[43]/nOther research areas include:", "67154678": "Kathy Lynn Hudson is an American microbiologist specializing in science policy.

After research in the laboratory of Karl Wilhelm von Kupffer, he began to specialise in embryology, publishing his first paper on the biochemistry of gastrulation in 1895. He graduated from Munich University in 1897, having studied under A. A. Boehm./nAfter graduation, he worked in the histology laboratories of the universities of Strasbourg and Bern until 1907. At this time, he met his future wife and lifelong collaborator, the Russian-born medical trainee Lydia Felicine. His continuing interest, with the help of his relative Leonid Mandelstam, in the advances in physics at that time aided in the formulation of his morphogenetic field theory, which Gurwitsch himself viewed throughout his life as no more than a suggestive hypothesis./nServing in 1904 with the Russian army in the field, he had much time to think, and he reasoned with himself that even a full understanding of every developmental process might not provide, or even necessarily lead to, a sense of understanding of ontogeny as a whole; a holistic, \"top-down\" model was needed to explain the ordered sequence of such individual processes. This conviction led him to adopt field theory as an embryological paradigm. His ideas had much in common with his contemporary Hans Driesch, and the two developed a mutual professional admiration.[2]/nDuring the next decade, Gurwitsch contributed a series of landmark papers arguing that the orientation and division of cells was random at local level but was rendered coherent by an overall field which obeyed the regular inverse square law \u2013 an enterprise that required extensive statistical analysis. In 1907, he published his general treatise Atlas and Outline of Embryology of Vertebrates and of Man./nAfter the 1917 revolution, Gurwitsch fell upon hard times and accepted the chair of Histology at Taurida University, the chief seat of learning of the Crimean Peninsula, where he spent seven happy years. Here in 1923, he first observed biophotons or ultra-weak biological photon emissions \u2013 weak electromagnetic waves which were detected in the ultra-violet range of the spectrum./nGurwitsch named the phenomenon mitogenetic radiation, since he believed that this light radiation allowed the morphogenetic field to control embryonic development. His published observations, which related that cell proliferation of an onion was accelerated by directing these rays down a tube, brought him great attention. Some 500 attempts at replication, however, produced overwhelmingly negative results, so that the idea was neglected for decades until it commanded some renewed interest in the later 20th century.[3] However the furore, which may have sparked Wilhelm Reich's similar Orgone experiments, brought Gurwitsch an international reputation that led to several European lecture tours. His work influenced that of Paul Alfred Weiss in particular. William Seifriz regarded the existence of Gurwitsch rays as experimentally proven.[4]/nGurwitsch was Professor of Histology and Embryology at Moscow University from 1924 to 1929 but fell afoul of the Communist Party and was forced to relinquish the chair. He then directed a laboratory at the Institute of Experimental Medicine in Leningrad from 1930 until 1945, though he was forced to evacuate during World War 2. In 1941, he was awarded a Stalin Prize for his mitogenetic radiation work, since it had apparently led to a cheap and simple way of diagnosing cancer. He was director of the Institute of Experimental Biology in Leningrad from 1945 to 1948. He sought to redefine his \"heretical\" concept of the morphogenetic field in general essays, pointing to molecular interactions unexplained by chemistry./nGurwitsch retired in 1948 after Trofim Lysenko came to power but continued working at home.[5] Sadly, his wife Lydia died in 1951. However, his daughter, Anna, continued his work and, shortly after his death, contributed papers that supported some aspects of her father's work on \"mitogenetic\" rays.[6]/nField theories of morphogenesis had their heyday in the 1920s, but the increasing success of genetics confined such ideas to the backwaters of biology. Gurwitsch had been ahead of his time in his interest in the emergent properties of the embryo, but more modern self-organization theories (such as that of Ilya Prigogine) and treatments of non-equilibrium thermodynamics in living systems would show the extent to which the vectors he described can be generated without the assumption of an overarching field, so the search for a physical field was abandoned in favour of more neutral concepts like the paradigm of Systems Biology. The early interest in physics which inspired Gurwitsch in the end tended to render his ideas untenable.[7] The \"mitogenetic ray\" was one of the scientific topics characterized by Irving Langmuir as \"pathological science.\"[8]/nHowever, the tenacity of Anna Gurwitsch, together with the development of the photon counter multiplier, resulted in the confirmation of the phenomenon of biophotons in 1962. The observation was duplicated in a Western laboratory by Quickenden and Que Hee in 1974.[9] In the same year, Dr. V. P. Kaznacheyev announced that his research team in Novosibirsk had detected intercellular communication by means of these rays.[10] Fritz-Albert Popp claims they exhibit coherent patterns. These studies have drawn only fringe interest./nThere has been a recent revival in field theories of life, albeit again at the fringes of science, particularly among those who seek to include an account of developmental psychobiology. The influence of Gurwitsch's theory is particularly evident in the work of the British plant physiologist, Rupert Sheldrake, and his concept of \"morphic resonance.\"", "51589904": "Alexander Rudensky (born August 21, 1956)[1][2] is an immunologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center known for his research on regulatory T cells and the transcription factor Foxp3.[3]/nRudensky received his Candidate of Sciences degree in 1986 from the Gabrichevsky Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, Moscow, and completed his postdoctoral work at the Yale School of Medicine.[4] He is now the Chair of the Immunology Program and Director of the Ludwig Center at Memorial Sloan Kettering, as well as a professor at the Rockefeller University, Cornell University, Gerstner School of Graduate Studies, and Weill-Cornell Medical School.[5]/nIn a 2003 paper, Rudensky and colleagues showed that Foxp3 programs regulatory T cell development.[3] His lab continues to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying regulatory T cell activity, and the role these cells play in autoimmunity, tumor immunity, and immunity to infections.[6]/nThis biographical article related to medicine in the United States is a stub.

Having obtained his MD at Edinburgh in 1814, Grant gave up medical practice in favour of marine biology and the zoology of invertebrates, living on a legacy from his father. As a materialist and freethinker, and politically radical, he was open to ideas in biology that were considered subversive in the climate of opinion prevailing in Britain after the Napoleonic Wars. He cited Erasmus Darwin's Zo\u00f6nomia in his doctoral dissertation, a work which introduced the idea of evolution in poetical form./nIn 1824 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Dr John Barclay.[2]/nHe became one of the foremost naturalists of the early 19th century at Edinburgh and subsequently the first Professor of Comparative Anatomy at University College London. He is noted for his influence on the young Charles Darwin and his espousal of Geoffroy's ideas on evolution.[3]/nGrant held the UCL chair of comparative anatomy for life (1827\u20131874); he was elected FRS in 1836; he became Fullerian Professor of Physiology at the Royal Institution 1837\u20138, and in 1847 Dean of the UCL Medical Faculty. In 1853 he became Swiney lecturer in geology to the British Museum./nGrant travelled widely, visiting universities in France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland. He came into contact with the French zoologist \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire who promulgated a view on evolution similar to that of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's./nGrant studied marine life around the Firth of Forth, collecting specimens around the shores near a house he took at Prestonpans as well as from fishing boats, and becoming an expert on the biology of sponges and sea-slugs. He considered that the same laws of life affected all organisms, from monad to man (in this context monad means a hypothetical primitive living organism or unit of organic life). Following Geoffroy, Grant arranged life into a chain, or an escalator, which was kept moving upwards by the appearance of spontaneously emerging monads at its base./nIn 1824 Grant gave lectures on invertebrates, covering their comparative anatomy; these were in place of John Barclay. He was also elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.[4]/nGrant was a stalwart of the Plinian Society for student naturalists, which Charles Darwin joined in the autumn of 1826 on starting his second year of medical studies at Edinburgh University. Darwin became Grant's keenest student and assisted him with collecting specimens./nDuring that winter and spring Grant published twenty papers in Edinburgh journals, mostly on sponges, eggs and larvae, which won him an international reputation, with the papers being translated into French. Grant took Darwin as a guest to the Wernerian society which was held in Robert Jameson's room, with membership restricted to MDs; there Darwin saw a demonstration by John James Audubon. On 24 March 1827 Grant announced to the society that black spores often found in oyster shells were the eggs of a skate leech, and published a paper on this discovery. This discovery was in fact Darwin's and Darwin lost interest in Grant as a mentor after this event.[5] Darwin himself made a presentation on 27 March announcing this and his observations on sea-slug larvae to the Plinian Society./nDarwin contributed to Grant's investigations into the 'unity of plan' of animals which culminated with Grant's announcement to the Wernerian Society that he had identified the pancreas in molluscs, demonstrated with a pinned-out sea-slug. This showed a homology between these simple creatures and mammals, tying them into his controversial chain of life./nGrant then became Professor of Comparative Anatomy at University College London, a post he held from 1827 until his death in 1874. Grant's pay was \u00a339 per annum.[6] He was involved in radical and democratic causes, campaigning for a new Zoological Society museum run professionally rather than by aristocratic amateurs; and tried to turn the British Museum into a research institution run along French lines. He was opposed by Tories who attacked him for supporting \"the reptile press\" and its \"blasphemous derision of the truths of Christianity\" and succeeded in getting him voted out of a post at the Zoological Society of London. Richard Owen, vehemently opposed to Grant's evolution theory, succeeded in supplanting him./nDarwin visited Grant in 1831 to get advice on storing specimens immediately before setting out on the Voyage of the Beagle. When Darwin returned from his voyage, Grant was one of those to offer to examine his specimens, but was turned down: they do not seem to have had further contact.[7]/nOn his frequent trips to the continent Grant became close friends with Geoffroy, a leading French comparative anatomist. The Edinburgh extramural medical schools were fertile ground for Geoffroy's ideas, and Scottish radicals became Geoffroyan disciples. These included William A. F. Browne, a phrenologist who later turned his energies to asylum reform and neurological psychiatry. Grant took these ideas to London, where he introduced homology (the basic Geoffroyan technique) to his UCL students. He also advanced Lamarck and de Blainville, whose ideas were of similar vein, and included ideas of recapitulation theory.[8]/nGeoffroy was a deist, and his theory was not a theory of common descent, but a working-out of existing potential in a given type. For him, the environment causes a direct induction of organic change. This opinion Ernst Mayr labels as 'Geoffroyism'.[9] It is definitely not what Lamarck believed (for Lamarck, a change in habits is what changes the animal). Lawrence had argued in 1816 that the climate does not directly cause the differences between human races./nGeoffroy's comparative anatomy featured the comparison of the same organ or group of bones through a range of animals. He argued (1818\u201322) for the 'unity of composition' of all vertebrates.[10] One of his major discoveries was the homology of the opercular plates of the gill cover of fishes with the inner ear ossicles of mammals. Geoffroy's methods worked well for vertebrates, but when he compared vertebrates to invertebrates by turning invertebrates upside down and partly inside out \u2013 \"every animal is either inside or outside its vertebral column\" \u2013 he met his nemesis. The Geoffroy-Cuvier debate in Paris before the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences (15 February 1830) saw Georges Cuvier demolish his claim that the four Cuvierian branches of the animal kingdom could be reduced to one.[11] The relation between the ideas of Geoffroy and Cuvier can be expressed thus: whereas with Cuvier structure determines function, with Geoffroy function determines structure. The issue between them, however, was religious, political and social as well as scientific.[12]/nGrant first went public on the subject of evolution in 1826.[13] Here he speculated that 'transformation' might affect all organisms. He noted that successive strata seemed to show a progressive, natural succession of fossil animals. These forms \"have evolved from a primitive model\" by \"external circumstances\": this is a clear Lamarckian statement. Also, Grant accepted a common origin for plants and animals, and the basic units of life ('monads'), he proposed, were spontaneously generated. This is both reductionism and materialism. The programme went further than either Geoffroy or Lamarck, but was not a complete theory of evolution./nGrant was a 'progressive' in both social and scientific terms. He was widely and probably correctly regarded as a materialist or atheist: there was no place for the supernatural in his account of biology. He was a supporter of Thomas Wakley, The Lancet and the BMA, all of whom were anti-establishment in their day. The main idea of the radical reformers was that government should take over or at least oversee the licensing powers of the medical corporations.[14]/nWhen Grant came to London he was not eligible to become a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of London (RCP) because he was not a graduate of Oxford or Cambridge. Others who wished to practice in England had to take a licence from the RCP or acquire an apothecary's qualification. Grant refused to take out a London licence from the RCP, and so cut himself off from a lucrative source of income. He campaigned all his life for reform to both the RCP and the Royal College of Surgeons of London.[15]/nWakley responded to Grant's support for the Lancet and its radical programme with fulsome praise of Grant, and printed the text of all 60 lectures of Grant's comparative anatomy course in the Lancet for 1833\u20134. Reviewers agreed that Grant's course was the first 'comprehensive and accessible' exposition of philosophical anatomy in English.[16][17]/nGrant died at home at 2 Euston Grove, Euston Square, London,[18] still occupying the chair at UCL, a forgotten anachronism. In his will he bequeathed his estate, of less than \u00a31,500, to UCL.[19] He was buried on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery./nThe second half of Grant's long professional life was not successful, and his style of teaching zoology was swept aside by T. H. Huxley's disciple E. Ray Lankester, in the new Jodrell Chair of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy. Lankester did, however, retain, reorganise and expand the college zoology museum, now known as the Grant Museum of Zoology at UCL./nRobert Edmond Grant is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of African snake, Gonionotophis grantii.[20]", "39072534": "Kyrre Lekve (born 11 March 1968) is a Norwegian biologist and politician for the Socialist Left Party./nHe finished his secondary education in 1988, and minored in political science in 1991.

He studied science at the University of Budapest before obtaining his Ph.D. in zoology at the University of Innsbruck in Austria in 1950. At the end of that year, he emigrated to Australia. There he first worked in the Department of Zoology at the University of Western Australia for 3 years, before pursuing a career with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).  Bornemissza was known for his work on the Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965\u20131985) while working at CSIRO's Division of Entomology. He wrote scientific papers and books based on his research and contributed a collection of mounted beetle specimens to the Australian National Insect Collection and the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. In 2001 he was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for his services to Australian entomology./nBornemissza was born in Baja, Hungary, to Katalin Bornemissza and Ferenc Bornemissza, an engineer.[1] He began collecting and studying beetles in the forests around his hometown during his mid-teens and also volunteered in museums and scientific institutions in Budapest.[2]/nAfter receiving his doctorate from the University of Innsbr\u00fcck in Austria, Bornemissza fled central Europe to escape the post-World War II Soviet regimes and traveled to Western Australia, where he arrived on 31 December 1950.[1] Six months after arriving on Australian shores, while working with the Department of Zoology at the University of Western Australia,[3] he remarked upon a large number of old, dry cow dung pads that covered cattle grazing fields near Wooroloo, Western Australia[4] and compared this to the relatively dung-free cattle fields of his native Hungary. In Hungary and elsewhere in the world, dung beetles have adapted to be able to roll and bury large, moist cattle dung pads but native Australian beetles, which co-evolved alongside the marsupials, were not able to utilize bovine dung since cattle were only relatively recently introduced to Australia in the 1880s. Bornemissza hypothesized that the introduction of foreign dung beetle species that were able to roll and bury cattle dung pads would aid not only Australia's soil fertility by recycling the dung nutrients back into the ground, but would also reduce the number of pestilent flies and parasitic worms which use the dung pads as a breeding ground.[1] Bornemissza joined CSIRO in 1955[3] and continued to advocate for the introduction of bovine dung beetles to Australia whilst working on several other projects and studies.[1] The Australian Dung Beetle Project subsequently secured funding from the Australian Meat Research Committee and commenced in 1965.[5]/nBeyond his work in entomology, during the 1950s and 1960s, Dr. Bornemissza was also a keen amateur filmmaker.  In 1962 he won the Kodak Trophy for the 8mm Best Australian Entry at the Australian Amateur Cine Society 23rd International Gold Cup Competition for his entry \"The Burning Bush\", a documentary on the effect of bushfires on Australian ecosystems that made extensive use of time lapse photography.[citation needed]/nFrom 1965, Bornemissza traveled extensively in search of suitable dung beetles to introduce to Australia.[6] The first dung beetles to be introduced to Australia came from Hawaii, where beetles had already been introduced from Africa to biologically control populations of the pestilent horn fly. Samples of the species Onthophagus gazella were transported to Australia where they were bred in sterile conditions before being released in Queensland in 1968.  After the introduction, they became established across a large area of tropical Australia.[5]/nIt was realized that due to periods of seasonal inactivity by O. Gazella, further beetle species were needed to fill in the gaps in climatic and habitat preference and the peak time of beetle activity. To this end, Bornemissza traveled to Pretoria in 1970 where he helped establish a South African branch of the Australian Dung Beetle Research Unit. For 9 years,[7] he carried out research to find species of dung beetle that would not only be able to remove the bovine dung pads in Australia, but also those that would thrive in the varying climates found all over the continent. It was also important that the beetles chose, and the tiny parasites that the beetles carry, would not themselves become pests and so strict quarantining procedures were devised and developed.[8] In total, 43 species of beetle from Africa and Europe were introduced to Australia by CSIRO between 1968 and 1984.[7]/nThe funding for the Australian Dung Beetle Project was withdrawn in 1985 after the restructuring of the Australian Meat Research Committee, but Bornemissza believed that the full potential of the project had yet to be realized.[citation needed] He said, \"The introduction of exotic dung beetles and their subsequent establishment in Australia is now history and a very successful one at that. However, it fell short in filling all the climatic areas with their vast variety of habitats\".[citation needed] This last statement was made in a report by Penny Edwards in 2007, which summarised investigations made by Landcare Australia to evaluate the distribution and abundance of introduced species of dung beetle across Australia. The investigation found that 23 of the 43 species of dung beetle introduced by Bornemissza and his team were still established and thriving all over Australia, and it recommended that further research be carried out to fill the empty ecological niches with new species of introduced dung beetle.[citation needed] The work Bornemissza and his team undertook with the Australian Dung Beetle Project is credited with being the reason why Australians today can enjoy a terrace caf\u00e9 culture.[3] The success of the project in reducing the number of bush flies by 90% has meant that outside dining is no longer illegal, as it once was in the 1950s.[3] The \"Australian Salute\", a flick of the hand recognized by older generations of Australians as the only solution to rid oneself of flies at that time, is now a dwindling gesture.[3][9][10] The Australian Dung Beetle Project is also said to have affected soil, water, and pasture health that is \"undoubtedly worth many millions of dollars a year\".[11]/nBornemissza moved to Tasmania in 1979 and formally retired in 1983 but continued to work privately to foster awareness of beetles and conservation issues.[2][1] In retirement he compiled a collection of beetles for public display, which he donated to the Australian National Insect Collection in Canberra.[12] Following this 3-year project he commenced in 1993 a 20-year private project to assemble the largest collection of beetles ever presented for public display.  Entitled George Bornemissza's Forest Beauties of the Beetle World: A Tribute to Biodiversity and an Appeal for its Preservation, the collection is structured into five sections focussed on size range, allometry, color, secondary sexual dimorphism and zoogeography. As the sections were completed they were donated to the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery.[2][13] The Bornemissza Collection of beetles was the subject of an episode of the TV show \"Collectors\" shown on the Australian television channel ABC in 2005.[14]/nBornemissza also contributed to habitat conservation initiatives in Tasmania. He assessed, with Karyl Michaels, the effect of clear-felling and slash-burning of forest on lucanid beetles in Tasmania. These beetles feed on and reproduce in decaying wood and it was found that forest-clearing practices have led to a significant decrease in the distribution and abundance of several species.[citation needed] Some, including Bornemissza's Stag Beetle (Hoplogonus bornemisszai), are now considered endangered species, and improved forest management strategies in Tasmania are recommended.[15]/nBornemissza died in Australia on 10 April 2014 at age 90.[16][17]/nBornemissza received several awards including:/nSeveral species of beetle and other insects have been named after Bornemissza, including:[21]/n1.

In 1925, he published the results in one of the most known medical journals, the Analima.[9]\nAccording to this method the vaccination took only 6 days instead of 14\u201321 days of the existing methods. The other advantage was that this vaccination contained only dead viruses with sustained immunogens.

With his friend, Stanislaus von Prowazek, he described what would later be known as Rickettsia prowazekii, the pathogen of epidemic typhus. Rocha Lima named the organism after Prowazek and American bacteriologist Howard Taylor Ricketts (1871-1910).[1]/nHenrique da Rocha Lima received his M.D. degree from the Medical School of Rio de Janeiro in 1905. He was one of the founders of the Oswaldo Cruz Institute, where he worked as a professor of pathology with other famous Brazilian researchers, such as Oswaldo Cruz himself, Adolfo Lutz and Carlos Chagas (the discoverer of Chagas disease) in the areas of microbiology, immunology and infectious diseases. Rocha Lima developed an international career in medical research, working with pathologist Hermann D\u00fcrck (1869-1941) at the University of Munich, and from 1909, as director of the department of pathology at the Institute for Maritime and Tropical Diseases in Hamburg.[1]/nIn Brazil, he was a scientific and educational leader, as he participated in the foundation of the Paulista School of Medicine, and of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo.

Alice Wilson's early fascination with palaeontology, also had roots in her childhood, where she had already begun collecting fossils from the Cobourg Limestones near her home. This passion for palaeontology led her to transition into a role as a museum assistant within the palaeontology department of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) in 1909. These trips sparked her interest in fossils and the study of geology. Going outdoors also assisted in improving her struggling health. During her time in college, her brothers were already critically acclaimed experts in their respective fields of geology and mathematics.[1]/nGrowing up, Alice Wilson was surrounded by academics. For example, her older brother, Alfred, was a Ph.D. graduate from Harvard University and was a respectable geologist.[3] When Wilson reached the age of 20, she decided to enroll in the University of Toronto to study Modern Languages. However, due to her health, Wilson had to drop out during her final year and did not get her degree.[3] It remains somewhat uncertain whether her choice to pursue teaching was a genuine personal preference or a result of societal expectations at the time. According to her close friend Winston Sinclair, Wilson once confided that during her youth, teaching was often viewed as the most socially acceptable career path for young women. It is possible that this societal influence played a role in her decision to enter the teaching profession.[4]/nUpon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 65, as dictated by the prevailing laws of the time, Dr. Wilson found herself in a unique situation. It is noteworthy that her departure led to the recruitment of five individuals to undertake the tasks she had been handling. However, even in retirement, her commitment to her work and her sense of adventure remained undiminished. Remarkably, despite officially retiring, Dr. Wilson continued to contribute her expertise to the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC), volunteering her services without compensation. Her enduring dedication to the field is evident in her decision to remain engaged in geology-related activities. Dr. Wilson's sense of adventure extended beyond her professional life. During her retirement years, she embarked on exciting journeys that took her to diverse destinations./nIn 1932, Alice Wilson spent a month in the Bahama Islands and Guyana.[5] She ventured to Brazil, where she explored the depths of the Amazon jungle, and she also visited Mexico to actively participate in the International Geological Congress. These adventures underscore her passion for exploration and her lifelong commitment to the field of geology.[4]/nAlice Wilson's significant contributions to the understanding of the geology of Ontario and Quebec were motivated in part by gender-based restrictions within the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC). The prevailing policy at the time prevented women, including Wilson, from participating in field along side male colleagues, a restriction that persisted until 1970. To overcome this challenge, Wilson proposed an alternative approach to conducting fieldwork, successfully persuading the GSC to grant her permission for solo research expeditions in the relatively unexplored Ottawa-St. Lawrence Valley. Wilson embarked on these expeditions, exploring the terrain on foot and by bicycle to study geological formations. When faced with the GSC's refusal to provide her with a car, a convenience routinely provided to male counterparts, she independently purchased a vehicle to facilitate her research endeavors.[6]/nDespite her being a reputable geologist, Wilson experienced consistent denials of promotions based solely on her gender. She also encountered challenges in her relationships with colleagues, often being excluded and finding difficulty in project inclusion.[7]  Wilson's educational journey faced hurdles as well. Her final year of university took an unexpected turn when a severe bout of anemia affected her health to the point where she could not complete her coursework, leading to the discontinuation of her studies. After a recovery period spanning several years, she began a new chapter in 1907 by accepting a position as a clerk at the University of Toronto.[4]/nIn 1901 Wilson began studying modern language and history at the Victoria College in Toronto originally intending to be a teacher.[8] She did not finish her last year of studies due to health problems; suffered anemia and had to drop out, but continued education after recovering.[9] After regaining her health, Alice Wilson worked at the Museum of Minerology as an assistant.[10] She eventually completed her degree many years later in 1911.[1] In 1909, Wilson joined the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC), where she was a staff member for more than 50 years.[10] Despite being eligible to undertake a doctorate in 1915, Wilson was repeatedly denied paid time off from the GSC, even though the GSC was granting paid absences at the time. Wilson's direct boss from 1920, Edward M. Kindle, was supportive of Wilson and wanted her to take a leave and finish her doctorate though others in leadership roles at the GSC were much less so.[1] For seven years Wilson persisted, and finally was awarded a scholarship by the Canadian Federation of University Women (CFUW) in 1926. During the seven years, Wilson's health continued to decline further. However despite facing health problems, and knowing that if she was a man the leave would have been granted, she continued to ask for permission to pursue her Ph.D. She explained that as to her understanding \u201cthe grounds for refusal have been various, the fundamental reason has been that it would make a woman eligible for the highest positions in the Survey\u201d In 1924 she received leave however she faced another challenge of not receiving pay. This meant that she would need to find a way to fund her research outside of the Survey, something that was also not required of the men. During the seven years and after them, she actively applied for scholarships. This included one from the Canadian Federation of University Women. Despite the institution being in place to support women, Wilson faced another challenge with the Survey when they refused her allowance to apply for the annual scholarship. After much more resistance, Wilson was finally allowed to apply and became the 1926 recipient of the Canadian Federation of University Women\u2019s annual scholarship.[11]/nIn 1907, Wilson started her career at the University of Toronto museum in the mineralogy division, despite not having completed her degree. In 1909, she took an assistant job at the Victoria Memorial Museum, and then became eligible and took a temporary clerk position at the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC), which was headquartered at the Victoria Memorial Museum in Ottawa. Her past education of studying languages would later prove useful when she was requested to translate a portion of Karl Alfred von Zittel's Text-Book of Paleontology from German to English by Percy Raymond, whom also advocated Wilson to take a leave of absence from the GSC in order to finish her degree, of which she received in 1910.[8] Following her return in 1911, she was given a permanent position at the GSC, although she was still not allowed to partake in field studies alongside her male peers. This policy was later changed in 1970.[12]/nBefore the departure of colleague Percy Raymond, she wrote two articles, both of which recorded new species of animals. Respectively, a new branchiopod and then a bivalve.[8] Wilson faced significant difficulty being included in her colleagues' work after that./nIn 1916, during the First World War, Wilson's place of work, the Victoria Memorial Museum, was shut down and reoccupied as a war-time parliament. During this time, Wilson funded her projects with her own money, studying comparative anatomy and marine biology in Long Island, New York. Later, Wilson took part in the war-time effort on the home front, joining the Canadian equivalent of the Women's Land Army./nMeadowcroft had written that Wilson had become primary Geologist in 1945 but there is no proof of this.[5] At war's end in 1920, Wilson went back to the Victoria Memorial Museum.[8] She was promoted to assistant geologist in 1936.[1] This was in lieu of the position she had requested for, which was Assistant Paleontologist. This was the highest position she had been allowed to advance to, due to her difficulty obtaining the scholarships to pursue the level of education she wanted.[13]/nWhile working at the GSC, they did not allow women to work together with men during fieldwork. So Wilson created her own niche and did fieldwork at local sites in the Ottawa area, going on to eventually map over 14,000 square kilometres (5,400\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of the Ottawa St Lawrence Lowlands entirely on her own. For fifty years she studied the area on foot, by bicycle and eventually by car.[14] The GSC published the results of her fieldwork in 1946 and her Geology of the St. Lawrence Lowland, Ontario and Quebec was the first major geological publication about the area. In addition to a comprehensive discussion of its geology, Wilson covered the area's economic resources, including building stone, sand, gravel and drinking water. Wilson's research into the stratigraphy and invertebrate palaeontology of the Palaeozoic strata of eastern Canada was significant, though her contributions to the field did not gain recognition until after her retirement.[8] In Ontario, her focus was on invertebrate fossils during the Ordovician period, specifically sediments and fossils in the Ottawa Valley. In the Rocky Mountains and the Arctic, Wilson studied Ordovician fauna.[1] During the Great Depression, however, Wilson had to switch her focus from Ordovician to Devonian rocks, to meet the growing demand of petroleum in Western Canada. One of her tasks was to identify and categorize all Paleozoic invertebrates for examination. As a result, Wilson ordered the National Type Collection of fossils\u2014an internationally recognized reference collection.[8]/nDuring her work on the Devonian fossils, Alice Wilson was still devoted to her educational work by leading field trips, serving as a tour guide for the Museum, and as a speaker to organizations.[5]/nFrom 1948 until 1958 Wilson was a lecturer in Paleontology at Carleton College (later Carleton University). Carleton recognized Wilson both as a geologist and as an inspiring teacher with an honorary degree in 1960.[2] Wilson also worked to bring geology to a broader public. She wrote a children's book, The Earth Beneath our Feet, aimed at encouraging broader knowledge and interest in the science she was so passionate about.[15] The book for children is a sweet and interesting story about three kids asking a geologist different questions about the Earth starting with: \u201cWhy do some rocks skip on water better than others?\u201d Dr. Wilson once said that \u201cThe earth touches every life. Everyone should receive some understanding of it\u201d (Massive Science). This explains her passion for teaching others about geology and the admiration she gained from her students at Carleton who knew her affectionately as the \u201crock doctor.\u201d[16]/nWilson's work on researching the geology and paleontology in the area of Cornwall, Ontario and the St. Lawrence lowlands was important for the creation of the St. Lawrence Seaway that was built in 1954.[citation needed]/nWilson became a respected member of the GSC and mentored many young geologists through her lectures, field trips, publications, and museum exhibits. However, she was not referred to as \"Doctor\" by her colleagues until 1945\u201416 years after she obtained her doctorate.[15] She retired two years later, at the age of 65, as was required by law, though five new hires were required to do the same amount of work as Wilson.[14][12] However, she kept her office at the GSC and continued her work regardless of not being paid until her death in 1964.[17]/nA few months before her death, Alice gave up her office at the GSC and informed Dr. James M. Harrison about it. Although Dr. Harrison tried to convince her not to leave, Alice responded by saying, \u201c[Her] work is done.\u201d She was recognized by the GSC and they named a meeting room named after her, \u201cAlice Wilson Hall\u201d in Ottawa.[5]/nAlice Wilson died in Ottawa on the 15th of April 1964, at the age of 84 years old.[3]/nWilson was the first woman geologist hired by the Geological Survey of Canada (1909); one of the first two women elected as Fellows of The Royal Canadian Geographical Society (1930);[18] the first Canadian woman to be admitted to the Geological Society of America (1936); and the first female Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (1938).[19][14]/nIn 1935, when the government of R. B. Bennett was looking to honour a woman in the federal civil service, Wilson was chosen to become a Member of the Order of the British Empire.[19]/nIn 1991 the Royal Society of Canada established the Alice Wilson Awards for emerging women scholars.[20] Wilson was inducted into the Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame in 2005.[20]/nOn 18 October 2018, the Government of Canada dedicated a plaque to Wilson, recognizing her as a \"person of national historic significance at the Canadian Museum of Nature.\"[19][21]", "16135112": "Charles Cockell FRSE (born 21 May 1967) is a British astrobiologist who is professor of astrobiology in the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Edinburgh and co-director of the UK Centre for Astrobiology./nCockell received his undergraduate degree in biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of Bristol in 1989 and his D.Phil. in molecular biophysics, University of Oxford in 1994./nCockell was a National Research Council (National Academy of Sciences) Associate at the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field from 1995 to 1998 and then a visiting scholar at Stanford University.

It set up the world's first underground astrobiology laboratory in the Boulby Underground Science Laboratory, running a program MINAR (MIne Analog Research) which brought in international teams from NASA, ESA, India, and universities across the UK and internationally to study life in the deep subsurface and test planetary exploration equipment.[4][5][6]/nThe UKCA led or was affiliated with over 150 scientific papers in this period. Its scientific interests sat at the interface of planetary sciences and biological sciences involving laboratory, field and space mission studies. For example, the Centre oversaw the launch and implementation of the first biological mining experiment in space on the International Space Station in support of long-term human space settlement demonstrating the use of microorganisms to mine economically important elements in space.[7]/nThe centre also launched education initiatives. For example, the Centre hosted the astrobiology academy, an initiative to bring teachers together to develop curriculum that used astrobiology to teach science in schools. The initiative produced lesson plans that were used to launch astrobiology in Scottish primary and secondary schools in association with the Scottish government's RAISE programme (Raising Aspiration in Science Education). The material became part of the National Resource Guide and the National Education Portal. It has been used to teach astrobiology across India in collaboration with the A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Centre, reaching tens of thousands of students./nIn 2016, the centre, in collaboration with the Scottish Prison Service, launched Life Beyond, which involved prisoners in the design of settlements beyond Earth. Scottish prisoners published two books on settlement designs for the Moon and Mars.[8][9] This led to the development of a distance learning Life Beyond course, which can be undertaken by any prisoner around the world, and distributed to English and Welsh prisons in collaboration with the Prisoners' Education Trust. Life Beyond was cited by EuroPris as an example of best education practice in European prisons.[10]/nCockell has led or taken part in a number of expeditions. In 1993 Cockell piloted a modified microlight aircraft over the rainforests of Sumatra, Indonesia that he designed for catching moths over the canopy.[11] The Barnes Wallis Moth Machine had lights for nighttime flying, UV lights to attract moths and a net for scooping moths from the rainforest canopy.[12][13][14] The moth machine was flown during an expedition to the Kerinci-Seblat National Park which also collected plants and insects as part of a biodiversity study. The expedition had the patronage of RAF's No. 617 Squadron. During the expedition the moth machine clipped the top of a tree and crashed.[15] Over 5,000 moths were caught which were sent to Germany for biodiversity assessments.\nIn 1997 he was elected an International Fellow of The Explorers Club. Cockell has led or taken part in other scientific expeditions around the world, including over 20 scientific field expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic, the Atacama Desert, the Namib Desert, Iceland and elsewhere./nAlongside his work on astrobiology, Cockell has contributed to work exploring the social, political, and philosophical dynamics of long-term space settlement, in particular the relationship between space settlement and liberty. In 2022, he published \"Interplanetary Liberty: Building Free Societies in the Cosmos\", which is an examination of the problems for freedom beyond Earth and how to secure it.[16] In 2015 and 2016, he edited three multi-author volumes on space liberty, dissent, and governance for Springer, as part of the Space and Society series. He also contributed multiple chapters to each of the three volumes./nCockell is chair of the Earth and Space Foundation, a registered British charity (1043871) which awards grants to expeditions that successfully bridge the gap between environmentalism and the exploration and settlement of space by either using space technologies and ideas in environmental fieldwork or use environments on Earth to advance knowledge of other planets.[17][18][19][20] He founded the organisation in 1994. Since its establishment the foundation has supported over 60 field projects around the world.

She earned the first Ph.D. in biology awarded to a woman in the United States from Syracuse University in 1889,[2][3] and she would earn a second doctoral degree from the University of Chicago in 1896.[2] Clapp was the first female researcher employed at the Marine Biological Laboratory, as well as its first female trustee.[4] She was rated one of the top 150 zoologists in the United States in 1903, and her name was starred in the first five editions of American Men of Science (now American Men and Women of Science).[5]/nClapp matriculated at Mount Holyoke Female Seminary (now Mount Holyoke College) in 1868 and completed the equivalent of an undergraduate program in 1871.[1] (The school would not become a degree-granting college until 1888.[6]) She would continue to pursue postgraduate studies while she taught at the school, for example by accompanying colleague (and former professor) Lydia Shattuck in 1874 to the Anderson School of Natural History on Penikese Island, an experimental residential summer school that provided women with postbaccalaureate education when it was not a formal option for them.[7][8][9]/nSince a doctorate was required for a full faculty appointment to engage in complex research,[10] Clapp took a leave from Mount Holyoke to pursue graduate work at Syracuse University, earning a Ph.B. in 1888[5] and a doctoral degree in 1889, which made her the first woman in the United States to be awarded a Ph.D. in biology.[3] In 1891, she published a paper entitled \"Some Points in the Development of the Toadfish (Batrachus tau)\" in which she described features of the embryonic development and nesting habits of the oyster toadfish, now called Opsanus tau. This is one of the earliest known publications on segmentation of the toadfish egg.[11] In 1896, she received a second Ph.D. from the University of Chicago for her dissertation on The lateral line system of Batrachus tau, which was published in the Journal of Morphology in 1898.[12]/nAfter graduating from Mount Holyoke, Clapp spent a year as a Latin teacher at a boys' boarding school, Potter Hall, in Andalusia, Pennsylvania.[13] She returned to Mount Holyoke in 1872, teaching mathematics and natural history before becoming the college's gymnastics instructor from 1876 to 1891.[1]/nClapp incorporated knowledge gained from her postgraduate studies at the Anderson School into her teaching, in particular adopting co-founder Agassiz's dictum \"Study nature, not books!\"[2] For example, she introduced an embryology course, supplanted by specimens sent by alumni living abroad, to encourage study through hands-on laboratory experience instead of through books. Additionally, along with other New England entomologists, Clapp collected insects from the White Mountains of New Hampshire in the summer of 1875, as well as from various mid-Atlantic states, including the Johns Hopkins University marine station in Beaufort, South Carolina and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., in 1877.[1]/nClapp also completed brief studies on chick embryos and earthworms at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at Williams College in the early 1880s.[1][14] In 1888, Clapp began her affiliation with the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) during its inaugural session.[15] While at the MBL, Clapp conducted laboratory research using specimens from the area[11] and later became a lecturer and a trustee. In 1892, Clapp was one of the first women who joined the American Morphological Society (later the American Society of Zoologists and now the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology).[16]/nWhen she returned to Mount Holyoke after obtaining her doctoral degrees, she helped organize the department of zoology and develop its teaching facilities.[5] Although she was primarily known as an educator and authored few scientific research papers, she was ranked one of the top 150 zoologists in the U.S. by a 1903 study reported in American Men of Science.[1] She was named professor of zoology at her alma mater in 1904, fifteen years after her first Ph.D. in 1889.[10]/nClapp retired from teaching in 1916, though she would continue her research at the MBL and remain involved with the Mount Holyoke community as professor emeritus.[17]/nMount Holyoke awarded Clapp an honorary Sc.D. in 1921,[18] and in 1923, funding for a new biology building to be named the Cornelia Clapp Laboratory in her honor was raised.[19][20] The building was completed in 1924.[21]/nBy 1926, she was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science,[5] as her name was included in a list of special committee members that year. The rest of the committee was composed entirely of men, including ichthyologist David Starr Jordan, entomologist Leland O. Howard, and geneticist Edmund B. Wilson.[22]/nClapp was the first female investigator at the Marine Biological Laboratory, where she also served as librarian and trustee. Her affiliation with the institution ran from its opening in 1888 to her death in 1934.[4] Clapp was instrumental in establishing the fledgling Marine Biological Laboratory, and she was present at the MBL's inaugural season in 1888. She was adamant about the need for a library in Woods Hole with subscriptions to the top scientific journals, and she served as the first MBL librarian. In that role, she initiated an exchange program whereby the MBL sent out its Biological Bulletin and received other international journals in return, which over time added up to a magnificent collection.[4]/nClapp was elected to the MBL Board of Trustees in 1910. While three Boston women had been appointed trustees of the MBL upon its founding (Florence M. Cushing, Susan Minns, and Anna D. Phillips), women disappeared from the board after an 1897 shake-up, when the lab's founders ceded control of the board to a national cadre of scientists. Over the next 50 years, Clapp was one of only two women (along with Ethel Brown Harvey in the 1950s) to be elected an MBL Trustee, a position she held for the rest of her life.[4]/nIn 2021, the Marine Biological Laboratory renamed their primary lecture hall the Cornelia Clapp Auditorium.[23]/nClapp was a pioneering zoology researcher and leading ichthyology scholar.[24] Her work on the toadfish was instrumental in correcting the idea that its egg was attached by a \"sucker\" to the yolk stalk, as she discovered that it was instead adhered with a disc of \"transparent secretion\" that could be separated from the membrane.[11]/nShe was also an influential teacher at a time when women in the United States were increasingly given the opportunity to formally study science.[5] She preferred fieldwork to writing publications and dedicated much of her time to extending scientific knowledge and opportunities to women through education.[25] For example, one of her students and assistants, Louise B. Wallace, wrote an article building upon Clapp's toadfish research[11][26] that was published in an 1898 issue of the Journal of Morphology.[27] Wallace would go on to earn a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1908.[28]", "46183389": "Stephen Blair Hedges (known as S.

The dual processing of antigens in the antigen presenting cells activated both the CD4+ T helper as well as CD8+  cytotoxic T cells.[17][18][19] Further, he established that immunization with fusogenic liposomes resulted in expression of both IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3, the two key cytokines that eventually help in protection against intracellular infections.[17]/nKeeping in view that sperm-ova fusion during zygote formation is generally facilitated by specific lipid compositions of the two cell populations, he demonstrated the fusogenic attributes  of sperm plasma membrane lipids,[14] and established the prophylactic potential of spermatosome based vaccines against various intracellular pathogens.[20] As conventional egg phosphatidylcholine based liposomes are of limited application in activation of pathogen specific CTL response required for inhibiting intracellular pathogens, he developed non-phosphatidylcholine liposome as vehicle for delivery of antigens in prophylactic treatment of experimental leishmaniasis.[18] Further, the liposome/niosome based vaccines were also found to be effective against malaria parasite.[21] In addition, he has prepared archael lipid based liposomes and demonstrated their immunoadjuvant potential in model animals. Of note, the archaeosome based vaccine were used to mount long lasting memory response against experimental listeriosis.[22]/nFurther, Dr. Owais has highlighted interactions between two mycobacterial proteins viz. Rv3619 (RD9 family) and Rv3620 (CFP-10 analog). He demonstrated that Rv3619 protein disrupted the biomembrane and also evoked a strong immunological response.[23] Moreover, it was revealed that nanoparticle mediated targeting of RD9 gene products to dendritic cells favors Th1 prototype of CD4+ T lymphocytes.[24] He had successfully expressed L7/L12 ribosomal protein, SOD-IL-18 fusion protein of Brucella spp. and trypanothione reductase of Leishmania donavani.[25] The recombinant proteins were used as potent subunit vaccines in protection studies.[26][27] Liposome-based DNA vaccine developed by Dr. Owais has shown remarkable promise against experimental murine brucellosis.[28]/nBesides introducing liposome, niosome and microsphere based novel particulate vaccines; Dr. Owais has recently employed an autologous plasma bead based dual antigen delivery system as a prophylactic strategy against intracellular infections.[29] The liposome/microsphere entrapped antigen further co-entrapped in dual core fibrin beads based vaccine was shown to eliminate intracellular pathogens from systemic circulation.[30]/nLiposomes have been widely considered useful as drug/enzyme/nucleic acid vehicles in therapy. However, their successful application was limited by their rapid lysis in blood, major uptake by the RES, and lack of availability of simple procedures for specific targeted delivery. The main emphasis of Dr. Owais has been therefore on addressing some of the problems associated with the liposomes as drug delivery systems. He demonstrated that covalent attachment of anti-erythrocyte F(ab')2 to the liposomes surface enables the liposomes to specifically recognize the erythrocytes in vivo and deliver their contents to these cells. It was further demonstrated that the entrapment of anti-malarial drugs like chloroquine (chq), in the antibody-coated liposomes increases the drug efficacy not only against the chq-sensitive but also against the chq-resistant malarial infections. Encouraged by these results, the liposomes were coated with F(ab')2 fragments of a monoclonal antibody which specifically recognized the malaria-infected erythrocytes (Patent No. 182550).[31] The monoclonal antibody bearing liposomes with encapsulated chq were found to be highly effective in the treatment of chq-resistant experimental malaria.[32]/nHe was awarded the Young Scientist Award (MYSA) in Life Sciences in 2002.[2] Aligarh Muslim University bestowed him with Outstanding University Researcher Award in 2008 and again with the Best Teacher Award in 2009.[2] The Department of Biotechnology (DBT) of the Government of India awarded him the National Bioscience Award for Career Development, one of the highest Indian science awards in 2007.

She later discovered the gene responsible for Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that causes pancreatic and hematologic problems.[1] She is a Senior Scientist Emeritus at SickKids Research Institute and a professor in the Department of Molecular Genetics at the University of Toronto.[2]/nRommens grew up on a farm in eastern New Brunswick, Canada.[3] She earned both her bachelor's degree and a PhD in molecular biology from the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton.[3] She was awarded a Beaverbrook Scholarship for her undergraduate education,[4] and she earned a dual undergraduate degree in biology and organic chemistry.[2] During her graduate education she studied synthetic chemistry in addition to molecular biology, and she received her PhD in 1986.[3] In 1986, she started post-doctoral training in the lab of Lap-Chee Tsui at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada (commonly referred to as SickKids).[5]/nRommens became a senior scientist at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada and a professor at the University of Toronto.[2]/nRommens helped identify the gene behind cystic fibrosis, the CFTR gene (short for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), which was found to be an ion channel. This work was carried out when she was a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Lap-Chee Tsui at the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto, Canada, and was a collaboration between Tsui's lab, including fellow postdoctoral researcher Batsheva Kerem, and a team of researchers led by Francis Collins at the University of Michigan.[6] The CFTR gene was discovered through genetic linkage analysis involving looking for genetic markers that were present in patients with cystic fibrosis but not present in their non-affected relatives. Due to the phenomenon of recombination, whereby parts of chromosomes swap homologous segments during germ cell development, each chromosome a child inherits is a mix of the both of that parent's copies of that chromosome. Markers would only be consistently co-inherited with the gene behind cystic fibrosis if they were close together on the chromosome, so Rommens and other researchers used markers to find the approximate location of the gene.[5] They then used a combination of chromosome walking and chromosome hopping or jumping to locate the CF gene, which they named cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR).[6]/nRommens' work on cystic fibrosis didn't stop after she helped identify the CFTR gene. Instead, she continued to research CF once she started her own lab, using her molecular genetics expertise to look outside of the CFTR gene for insight into CF. She helped lead research to discover genetic modifiers of CF - versions of genes other than CFTR that either worsen or ameliorate the effects of CFTR mutations. Such modifiers could help explain why patients with the same CFTR mutations can have differing disease severity.[7] For example, around 15 percent of CF patients are born with an intestinal obstruction called meconium ileus, and, by analyzing genomes from almost 4,000 CF patients, Rommens' team found genetic risk factors associated with developing meconium ileus and lung problems.[8][9] In addition to using genetics to investigate how multiple genes contribute to CF pathology, she used mouse models to study how mutations in the CFTR gene affect multiple organ systems.[10]/nRommens also investigated the causes of other genetic diseases, chiefly Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder that causes pancreatic and hematologic problems. It presents with some of the same symptoms as CF and, after CF, SDS Is the second most common cause of pancreatic insufficiency in children.[11] The pancreas is responsible for producing many digestive enzymes and problems with the pancreas in SDS patients prevent sufficient amounts of these enzymes from reaching the intestines, leading to malabsorption of nutrients.[12] Among other symptoms, the disease often presents with digestive problems, skeletal abnormalities, and frequent infections.[11] In 2002, Rommens discovered that SDS is caused by mutations in the SBDS gene.[1] In addition to the SBDS gene, humans have an SBDS pseudogene (SBDSP), a copy of the SBDS gene which arose via a genetic duplication event, then became inactivated through genetic mutations.[13] Rommens found that patients with SDS had segments of their normal SBDS genes swapped out for the corresponding (mutated) segments of the pseudogene.[1] The most common of the mutations they discovered introduced premature stop codons (PTCs) which led the patients to produce truncated versions of the SBDS protein.[14] This gene was uncharacterized at the time, but Rommens' lab and others would go on to show that, among other potential functions, SBDS is involved in ribosomal maturation.[15] Ribosomes are cellular protein-making complexes, so problems with SBDS could lead to problems with protein synthesis.[15] Rommens helped educate families affected with SDS at a weeklong volunteer-run camp called Camp Sunshine in Casco, Maine.[3]/nRommens also discovered genes implicated in breast and prostate cancer, as well as Alzheimer's disease.[3] She was involved in genetic research on the neurodegenerative disease Huntington's disease as well as Wilson's disease, a copper storage disorder.[4]", "56308757": "Rae Natalie Prosser de Goodall (April 13, 1935, near Lexington, Ohio, United States \u2013 May 25, 2015, Estancia Harberton, Tierra del Fuego Province, Argentina,[1][2]) also known as Natalie Goodall, was a biologist based in Tierra del Fuego Province, Argentina and known for studying the region's flora and fauna.[3]/nRae Natalie Prosser de Goodall was born Rae Natalie Prosser on a farm near Lexington, Ohio.[4] She was awarded an art scholarship to Kent State University, where she became a member of the Gamma Phi Beta sorority.

A friend and  mentor of Steinbeck, they collaborated on and co-authored the book, Sea of Cortez (1941)./nEleven years later, and just three years after the death of Ed Ricketts, John Steinbeck reprinted the narrative portion of their coauthored book with a new publisher, with Steinbeck removing Ed as coauthor, adding a biography of Ed Ricketts and re-titling the book The Log from the Sea of Cortez (1946). Steinbeck also added a eulogy for Ricketts, though it was met with public backlash.[why?]/nGwyn Conger Steinbeck, the writer's second wife, thought highly of Ricketts. She said, \"There was such a special magic about Ed Ricketts, and, in many ways he was John's offspring; he was the source of the Steinbeck Nile.\"[1]/nRicketts was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Abbott Ricketts and Alice Beverly Flanders Ricketts.  He had a younger sister, Frances, and a younger brother, Thayer.  His sister, Frances (Ricketts) Strong, said of him that he had a mind like a dictionary and was often in trouble for correcting teachers and other adults.[2]  Ricketts spent most of his childhood in Chicago, except for a year in South Dakota when he was ten years old./nAfter a year of college, Ricketts traveled to Texas and New Mexico.  In 1917, he was drafted into the Army Medical Corps. He hated the military bureaucracy but, according to John Steinbeck, \"was a successful soldier\"./nAfter discharge from the army, Ricketts  studied zoology at the University of Chicago. He was influenced by his professor, W. C. Allee,[2] but dropped out without taking a degree.  He then spent several months walking through the American south, from Indiana to Florida.  He used material from this trip to publish an article in Travel magazine titled \"Vagabonding Through Dixie\".  He returned to Chicago and studied some more at the university.[2]/nIn 1922, Ricketts met and married Anna Barbara Makar, daughter of Croatian immigrants- Marija Piskuric (married as Mary Makar) and Miho (Michael) Makar. As a private person, Anna often went by other names of \"Nancy\" and even \"Barbara\", and Ricketts was known to call her \"Nan\". Anna was born in Johnstown, PA in the beginning of 1900. Ricketts and Makar married in Chicago, Illinois, in 1922 and one year later they had a son, Edward F. Ricketts, Jr.[3] and moved to California to set up Pacific Biological Laboratories with Albert E. Galigher: Galigher was Ricketts' college friend with whom he had run a similar business on a smaller scale.  In 1924, Ricketts became sole owner of the lab, and soon two daughters were born: Nancy Jane on November 28, 1924, and Cornelia on April 6, 1928./nBetween 1925 and 1927, Ricketts' sister Frances and both his parents moved to California; Frances and their father Abbott worked with Ricketts at the lab. In late 1930 Ricketts met aspiring writer John Steinbeck and his wife Carol,[2] who had moved to Pacific Grove earlier in the year. For more than a year Carol worked half-time for Ricketts at the lab, until 1932 when Ricketts' wife Nan left, taking their two daughters, and Ricketts no longer had enough money to pay Carol's salary. Steinbeck himself also spent time at the lab, learning marine biology, helping Ricketts preserve specimens and talking about philosophy. Steinbeck lived very near the lab. What kept them together was the discovery that each had an almost boundless curiosity about almost everything, and that their personality meshed so well. Steinbeck had a need to give, and Ricketts a need to receive. Ricketts made listening an art. At one point in Steinbeck's life, he suffered an  \"overwhelming emotional upset\", and went to the lab to stay with Ricketts. Ricketts played music for Steinbeck until he could bear to come back to himself.[4]/nNan's separation from Ricketts in 1932 was the first of many separations. In 1936, Ricketts and Nan separated for good, and he took up residence in his lab. On November 25, 1936, a fire spread from the adjacent cannery, destroying the lab. Ricketts lost nearly everything, including an extraordinary amount of correspondence, research notes, manuscripts, and his prized library, which had held everything from invaluable scientific resources to his beloved collection of poetry. However, the manuscript of Ricketts' textbook (with Jack Calvin) Between Pacific Tides had already been sent to the publisher.[2] John Steinbeck would become a silent 50% partner in the lab, after funding its reconstruction costs./nIn 1940, Ricketts and Steinbeck journeyed to the Sea of Cortez (Gulf of California) in a chartered fishing boat to collect invertebrates for the scientific catalog in their book, Sea of Cortez. Also in 1940, Ricketts began a relationship with Eleanor Susan Brownell Anthony \"Toni\" Solomons Jackson, who became his common-law wife.[5][6][7][8]  As Steinbeck's secretary, Jackson helped edit The Log From the Sea of Cortez. Jackson, who had attended the University of California, Los Angeles, was the daughter of Katherine Gray Church[9][10] and Theodore Solomons, an explorer and early member of the Sierra Club, who had discovered and defined the John Muir Trail.[11]  Jackson and her young daughter Katherine Adele moved in with Ricketts and lived with him until 1947. In addition to Steinbeck, their circle of friends included the novelist and painter Henry Miller and the mythologist, writer, and lecturer Joseph Campbell.[12]/nDuring World War II, Ricketts again served in the Army, this time as a medical lab technician; he was drafted in October 1942, missing the age cut-off by days. During his service, he kept collecting marine life and compiling data. His son was drafted in 1943./nIn 1945, Steinbeck's novel Cannery Row was published. Ricketts, the  model for \"Doc\" became a celebrity, and tourists and journalists began seeking him out. Steinbeck portrayed \"Doc\" (and thus, Ricketts) as a many-faceted intellectual who was somewhat outcast from intellectual circles, a party-loving drinking man, in close touch with the working class and with the prostitutes and bums of Monterey's Cannery Row. Steinbeck wrote of \"Doc\": \"He wears a beard and his face is half Christ and half satyr and his face tells the truth.\"[13]/nRicketts himself read Cannery Row with exasperation, by all accounts, but ended saying simply that it could not be criticized because it had not been written with malice.[14]  Ricketts was also portrayed as \"Doc\" in Sweet Thursday, the sequel to Cannery Row; as \"Friend Ed\" in Burning Bright; as \"Doc Burton\" in In Dubious Battle; as Jim Casy in The Grapes of Wrath; and as \"Doctor Winter\" in The Moon Is Down./nIn September 1946, Ricketts' daughter Nancy Jane had a son, making Ricketts a grandfather. That same year the health of his stepdaughter Kay deteriorated due to a brain tumor; she died the following year, on October 5, 1947. Kay's mother, Toni left Ricketts shortly afterwards./nJust a few weeks later, Ricketts met Alice Campbell, a music and philosophy student half his age. They \"married\" in early 1948,  though the marriage was not valid because Ricketts had never legally divorced Nan./nIn March 1948 in New York City, Toni Jackson married Dr Benjamin Elazari Volcani,[15] a renowned microbiologist she had met while he was working with the famous microbiologist C. B. van Niel (a student of Albert Kluyver's) at Stanford University's Hopkins Marine Station in Monterey in 1943./nIn 1948, Ricketts and Steinbeck planned together to go to British Columbia and write another book, The Outer Shores, on the marine life north towards Alaska.[2] On previous trips Ricketts had already done most of the needed research and he gave Steinbeck the typescripts for these as he had done previously with The Sea of Cortez.[16]/nA week before the planned expedition, on May 8, 1948, as Ricketts was driving across the railroad tracks at Drake Avenue, just uphill from Cannery Row, on his way to dinner after his day's work, a Del Monte Express passenger train hit his car.[17][18]  He lived for three days, conscious at least some of the time, before dying on May 11./nA life-size bust of Ricketts, at the site of the long-defunct rail crossing, commemorates the biologist-philosopher who inspired novelist John Steinbeck and mythologist Joseph Campbell. Passers-by often pick nearby flowers and place them in the statue's hand. Also at the crossing are derelict crossbucks marking the site of the accident./nIn 1923, Ed Ricketts and his business partner Albert Galigher started Pacific Biological Laboratories (PBL), a marine biology supply house.  The lab was located in Pacific Grove at 165 Fountain Avenue.[19]  The business was later moved to 740 Ocean View Avenue, Monterey, California, with Ricketts as sole owner. Today, that location is 800 Cannery Row./nOn November 25, 1936, a fire broke out at the Del Mar Cannery next to the lab. Most of the laboratory's contents were destroyed. The typescript of Between Pacific Tides survived, as it had already been sent to Stanford University for publication. With an investment from John Steinbeck, who became silent partner and 50% owner of the business as a result, Ricketts rebuilt the lab using the original floorplan./nRicketts' lab on Cannery Row had attracted visitors who ran the gamut from writers, artists and musicians to prostitutes and bums. Gatherings often included discussions of philosophy, science and art, and sometimes developed into parties that continued for days.[17] Participants in meetings had included Steinbeck, Bruce Ariss, Joseph Campbell (who had worked at the lab as Ricketts' assistant), Adelle Davis,[20] Henry Miller, Lincoln Steffens and Francis Whitaker. Amidst the tumult of commercial activity and tourist attractions that Cannery Row has become in recent decades, the modest and mostly unnoticed and unmarked lab stands as a silent witness to the bygone era celebrated in Steinbeck's work./nRicketts' laboratory business was fictionalized in Steinbeck's Cannery Row as \"Western Biological Laboratories.\"[21]/nSteinbeck was inspired to write The Pearl after visiting La Paz, Baja California Sur, with Ricketts on their Sea of Cortez expedition./nIn addition to his writings on marine life, Ricketts wrote three philosophical essays; he continued to revise them over the years, integrating new ideas in response to feedback from Campbell, Miller, and other friends. The first essay lays out his idea of \"nonteleological thinking\" \u2013 a way of viewing things as they are, rather than seeking explanations for them. In his second essay, \"The Spiritual Morphology of Poetry,\" he proposed four progressive classes of poetry, from naive to transcendent, and assigned famous poets from Keats to Whitman to these categories. The third essay, \"The Philosophy of 'Breaking Through',\" explores transcendence throughout the arts and describes his own moments of 'breaking through', such as his first hearing of Madame Butterfly.[22]/nAccording to his letters, conversations with composer John Cage helped Ricketts clarify some of his thoughts on poetry, and gave him new insight into the emphasis on form over content embraced by many modern artists./nEven though Steinbeck presented the essays to various publishers on behalf of Ricketts, only one was ever published in his lifetime: the first essay appears (without attribution) in a chapter titled \"Non-Teleological Thinking\" in The Log From the Sea of Cortez. [1] All of his major essays, along with other shorter works were published in The Outer Shores, vols. 1 and 2, edited by Joel Hedgpeth, and with additional biographical commentary also by Hedgpeth. Much of this material appears in Katharine Rodger's book, Breaking Through: Essays, Journals, and Travelogues of Edward F. Ricketts (2006)./nIn the 1930s and 1940s, Ricketts strongly influenced many of Steinbeck's writings. The biologist inspired a number of notable characters in Steinbeck's novels, and ecological themes recur in them. Ricketts' biographer Eric Enno Tamm notes that, except for East of Eden (1952), Steinbeck's writing declined after Ricketts' death in 1948.[17]/nRicketts also influenced the mythologist Joseph Campbell.  This was an important period in the development of Campbell's thinking about the epic journey of \"the hero with a thousand faces.\" Campbell lived for a while next door to Ricketts, participated in professional and social activities at his neighbor's, and accompanied him, along with Xenia and Sasha Kashevaroff, on a 1932 journey to Juneau, Alaska, on the Grampus.[23]  Like Steinbeck, Campbell played with a novel written round Ricketts as hero, but unlike Steinbeck, didn't complete the book.[24] Bruce Robison writes that \"Campbell would refer to those days as a time when everything in his life was taking shape.... Campbell, the great chronicler of the \"hero's journey\" in mythology, recognized patterns that paralleled his own thinking in one of Ricketts's unpublished philosophical essays. Echoes of Carl Jung, Robinson Jeffers and James Joyce can be found in the work of Steinbeck and Ricketts as well as Campbell.\"[17]/nHenry Miller wrote about Ricketts in his book The Air-Conditioned Nightmare: [Ed Ricketts is] \"a most exceptional individual in character and temperament, a man radiating peace, joy and wisdom\" and said that Ricketts was (apart from L. C. Powell) the only person whom Miller, during his journey across USA, found being \"satisfied with his lot, adjusted to his environment, happy in his work, and representative of all that is best in the American tradition.\"[25]/nIn Ricketts' day, ecology was early in its development. Now-common concepts such as habitat, niche, succession, predator-prey relationships, and food chains were not yet mature ideas. Ricketts was among a few marine biologists who studied intertidal organisms in an ecological context./nHis first major scientific work \u2014 now regarded as a classic in marine ecology, and in its fifth edition \u2014 was Between Pacific Tides, published in 1939, co-authored with Jack Calvin. The third and fourth editions were revised by Joel Hedgpeth, a contemporary of Ricketts and Steinbeck; Hedgpeth continued the book's taxonomic excellence, while retaining its ecological approach./nThe pioneering nature of Ricketts' book may be appreciated by comparison with another classic work, now in its fourth edition, that was published two years later, in 1941: Light's Manual, by S. F. Light, of the University of California, Berkeley. Light's Manual is technical, difficult for laymen, but essential for specialists. On the other hand, Ricketts' Between Pacific Tides is readable, full of observations and side comments, and readily accessible to anyone with a genuine interest in seashore life. It cannot serve as a thorough manual to marine invertebrates, but it addresses the common and conspicuous animals in a style that invites and educates newcomers and offers substantial information for experienced biologists. It is not organized according to taxonomic classification, but instead by habitat. Thus, crabs are not all treated in the same chapter; crabs of the rocky shore, high in the intertidal, are in a separate section from crabs of lower intertidal zones or sandy beaches./nSome concepts that Ricketts used in Between Pacific Tides were novel then and ignored by some in academia. Ricketts, writes Bruce Robison of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, \"was 'a lone, largely marginalized scientist' with no university degrees, and he had to struggle... against... traditionalists\" to get the book published by Stanford University Press.[17]/nRicketts' subsequent book, Sea of Cortez, is almost two separate books. The first section is a narrative, co-written by Steinbeck and Ricketts (Ricketts kept a daily journal during the expedition; Steinbeck edited the journal into the narrative section of the book). Later, the narrative was published alone as The Log From the Sea of Cortez, without Ricketts's name. The remainder of the book, about 300 pages, is an \"Annotated Phyletic Catalog\" of specimens collected. This section was Ricketts' work alone. It was presented in the traditional taxonomic arrangement, but with numerous notes on ecological observations./nRicketts pursued pathfinding studies in quantitative ecology, analyzing the Monterey sardine fishery. In a 1947 article in the Monterey Peninsula Herald, he documented sardine harvests, described sardine ecology, and noted that harvests were declining as fishing intensity increased. When the sardines became depleted and the industry was destroyed, Ricketts explained what had happened to the sardines: \"They're in cans.\"[26]/nThe research Ricketts did on sardines was a seminal application of ecology to fisheries science, but it was not published as an academic paper. He is not widely recognized by fisheries scientists. The prominent fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly comments: \"That's probably due to the fact that his stuff isn't widely available... This is strange, but fisheries scientists so far as they are trained do extraordinarily little ecology... I will not publish a paper on pelagics without now mentioning Ricketts\".[27]/nThe Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute deploys a four kilometer depth rated remotely operated vehicle named in honor of Ricketts's work, the ROV  Doc Ricketts.[28]/nSince 1930, over 16 species have been named after Ricketts:[29]/nRicketts Bar MX in San Jose del Cabo, Baja California Sur, Mexico is named for him and features Bryant Fitch's photograph over the bar.[citation needed]/nDoc Ricketts is the name of a robotic undersea rover operated by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute.  The 12-foot-long (3.6 m), 10,000-pound (4,500 kg) submersible has explored the depths of Monterey Bay.[31]", "54342716": "Mitchell Sogin is an American microbiologist. He is a distinguished senior scientist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. His research investigates the evolution and diversity of single-celled organisms.[1]/nSogin grew up in Chicago and went to the University of Illinois on a swimming scholarship, intending to become a doctor.  Instead he continued on at the university to complete a MS in Industrial Microbiology under Z. John Ordal in 1967 and a PhD in Microbiology and Molecular Biology under Carl R. Woese in 1972./nSogin obtained a BS in Chemistry and Microbiology at the University of Illinois, Urbana in 1967.   He went on to join the staff at National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado where he was an NIH Postdoctoral Fellow in the lab of Norman R. Pace from 1972-1976 and then a senior staff member from 1976-1989. Sogin became a professor at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in 1980 and in 1989 joined the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole as a senior scientist. He founded the Josephine Bay Paul Center for Comparative Molecular Biology and Evolution at the Marine Biological Laboratory in 1997, and served as its director until 2013. Sogin has a professor appointment in the department of Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, and Biochemistry at Brown University.

His work demonstrated that the AIDS-related pathogen Pneumocystis shares a recent common ancestor with fungi instead of with the parasitic protozoa that cause malaria.[5] He also discovered the \u201crare biosphere\u201d which represents most of Earth\u2019s microbial diversity.[6] Sogin was the first to use PCR to amplify and sequence ribosomal RNA genes and to use next generation DNA sequencing to characterize complex microbial communities, which now dominates the field of molecular microbial ecology, including efforts underway within the Human Microbiome Project. He has contributed to analytical strategies to determine the taxonomic identity of marker gene surveys and with David Mark Welch of the Josephine Bay Paul Center has established the Visualization of Microbial Population Structures (VAMPS) website, which offers tools for comparing microbial community populations.[7] As part of the Census of Marine Life, Sogin formed and led the International Census of Marine Microbes. His group currently collaborates on studies of human microbiome dynamics with Eugene Chang of the University of Chicago. They study pouchitis, a model for ulcerative colitis.

Heart and breathing functions also happen to be vital signs used in health care.  Conventionally, heart and breathing functions were measured with tethered body sensors, while EDA was measured with galvanic skin response (GSR) sensors attached to the palm. Such obtrusive measurement methods were rendering continuous physiological monitoring impractical and were undercutting the aim of affective computing to understand human emotions. For instance, EDA palm sensing precluded affective monitoring when the subjects\u2019 hands were at work, like in driving.  To address these issues, Pavlidis designed contactless physiological measurement methods, which he operationalized by replacing sensors with thermal imaging trackers, and electronic devices with thermo-physiological models. His models were estimating heart (2001-2008), breath (2004-2010), and EDA signals (2009-2012) by operating on imagery of facial vasculature, the nostrils, and the perinasal region, respectively.  The latter was also a significant discovery, as the existence of facial EDA responses was unknown up to that time.[8]/nPavlidis first articulated his ideas for contactless, continuous, and automated physiological measurements in the paper `Continuous physiological monitoring', which appeared in the 2003 IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) conference proceedings.[9]  In 2004, Pavlidis and his colleagues reported imaging methods for contactless measurement of blood flow and breath in IEEE CVPR[10] and IEEE EMBS,[11] respectively. In the 2005 CVPR, Pavlidis and his colleagues followed up with an imaging method for contactless measurement of pulsation.[12] The evolution of the contactless pulse and breath measurement methods culminated with Pavlidis\u2019  IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering publications.[13][14]/nIn 2009, Pavlidis reported progress on his third and final objective \u2013 a thermal imaging method to measure EDA responses on the face. Pavlidis placed emphasis on modeling and validating the phenomenon itself in his first paper on the matter.[15] After he documented the existence of facial EDA,[15] Pavlidis and his group published in 2012 a follow-up paper in the IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing,describing two computational methods to remotely measure facial EDA - one method was based on image morphology while the other was based on spatial isotropic wavelets.[16]/nSince then, contactless physiological monitoring has been finding an increasing number of applications in personal health informatics. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Boston Dynamics released the Dr. Spot canine robot, equipped with thermal and visual cameras for contact-free physiological measurements in clinical settings.[17]/nIoannis Pavlidis demonstrated that innovative affective computing methods must be employed within naturalistic research designs to deliver on their promise of understanding the human state. His studies approached humans as complex systems, unraveling the intricacies of the `fight or flight\u2019 syndrome in deceptive behaviors and driving distractions./nStudies on Deceptive Behaviors.\nIn collaboration with Mark G. Frank, Pavlidis carried out naturalistic deception studies with unwired participants who chose freely to deceive interviewers, if they thought it would help an issue dear to them, but knowing if their deception failed, their issue would suffer. This was an unprogrammed, high stakes behavior, producing real-life `fight or flight\u2019 responses. Pavlidis and colleagues showed that pointed questions startle deceptive subjects, increasing their periorbital blood flow.[18][19] This finding linked errant human communication with unnecessary ocular activation \u2013 a bio-evolutionary remnant of `fight or flight\u2019 responses in physical danger./nPavlidis\u2019 `fight or flight\u2019 analysis of deception was one of the first breakthroughs attributable to the fledging affective computing field. His Nature article on the topic[18] put the new affective computing methods on the map and deeply influenced research on deceptive behaviors. In the aftermath of his publications, the deception detection literature moved from obtrusive sensors and heuristics to unobtrusive sensors and computational algorithms.[20][21][22][23] These futuristic methods of deception detection also entered popular culture. Pavlidis' system featured in episode 18 of the Discovery Channel\u2019s  `Weird Connections' series,[24] and inspired the interrogation technologies shown in the drama series `Agency' of CBS.[25] Ioannis Pavlidis' initial collaboration with James A. Levine from Mayo Clinic and his subsequent research efforts to model deceptive behaviors have been chronicled by journalist Evan Ratliff and colleagues in their book SAFE.[26]/nStudies on Driving Distractions and Micro-stressors.\nPavlidis, working together with the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, showed that both absent-minded driving and texting while driving generate `fight or flight\u2019 related hand-tremors. The difference, however, is that with eyes constantly on the road, the absent-minded drivers\u2019 anterior cingulate cortex can still manage driving subconsciously, by `hijacking\u2019 the hand-eye feedback loop and counterbalancing tremors; this is not possible for texting drivers, with eyes intermittently on the road. In the latter case, failure to counter-balance the effect of tremors leads to lane deviations.[27] This finding established the unmitigated danger texting poses to driving safety and had broad impact to public perceptions and legal cases on the matter.[28][29][30]/nIn more recent work, Pavlidis demonstrated that a portion of the driving population exhibits significant stress responses even in trivial acceleration events, such as stop-and-go traffic - a phenomenon he termed `accelarousal'.[31] Accelarousal is likely associated with genetic predisposition and is now considered a prime example of daily micro-stressors, which many believe should factor into the design of self-driving cars.[32]", "20329543": "Fran\u00e7ois Trucy (born 9 June 1931) is a former member of the Senate of France, who represented the Var department.

Borlaug was awarded multiple honors for his work, including the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal, one of only seven people to have received all three awards.[3]/nBorlaug received his B.S. in forestry in 1937 and PhD in plant pathology and genetics from the University of Minnesota in 1942. He took up an agricultural research position with CIMMYT in Mexico, where he developed semi-dwarf, high-yield, disease-resistant wheat varieties.[4][1] During the mid-20th century, Borlaug led the introduction of these high-yielding varieties combined with modern agricultural production techniques to Mexico, Pakistan, and India. As a result, Mexico became a net exporter of wheat by 1963. Between 1965 and 1970, wheat yields nearly doubled in Pakistan and India, greatly improving the food security in those nations.[5]/nBorlaug was often called \"the father of the Green Revolution\",[6][7] and is credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation.[8][3][9][10][11][12] According to Jan Douglas, executive assistant to the president of the World Food Prize Foundation, the source of this number is Gregg Easterbrook's 1997 article \"Forgotten Benefactor of Humanity.\" The article states that the \"form of agriculture that Borlaug preaches may have prevented a billion deaths.\"[13] Dennis T. Avery also estimated that the number of lives saved by Borlaug's efforts to be one billion.[12] In 2009, Josette Sheeran, then the Executive Director of the World Food Programme, stated that Borlaug \"saved more lives than any man in human history\".[14] He was awarded the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increasing food supply./nLater in his life, he helped apply these methods of increasing food production in Asia and Africa.[15] He was also an accomplished wrestler in college and a pioneer of wrestling in the United States, being inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame for his contributions.[16][17]/nBorlaug was the great-grandchild of Norwegian immigrants to the United States. Ole Olson Dybevig and Solveig Thomasdatter Rinde, of Feios, a small village in Vik kommune, Sogn og Fjordane, Norway, emigrated to Dane County, Wisconsin, in 1854.[citation needed] The family eventually moved to the small Norwegian-American community of Saude, near Cresco, Iowa. There they were members of Saude Lutheran Church, where Norman was baptized and confirmed./nBorlaug was born to Henry Oliver (1889\u20131971) and Clara (Vaala) Borlaug (1888\u20131972) on his grandparents' farm in Saude in 1914, the first of four children. His three sisters were Palma Lillian (Behrens; 1916\u20132004), Charlotte (Culbert; 1919\u20132012) and Helen (b. d. 1921). From age seven to nineteen, he worked on the 106-acre (43\u00a0ha) family farm west of Protivin, Iowa, fishing, hunting, and raising corn, oats, timothy-grass, cattle, pigs and chickens. He attended the one-teacher, one-room New Oregon #8 rural school in Howard County, through eighth grade./nToday, the school building, built in 1865, is owned by the Norman Borlaug Heritage Foundation as part of \"Project Borlaug Legacy\".[18] Borlaug was a member of the football, baseball and wrestling teams at Cresco High School, where his wrestling coach, Dave Barthelma, continually encouraged him to \"give 105%\".[8]/nBorlaug attributed his decision to leave the farm and pursue further education to his grandfather's urgent encouragement to learn: Nels Olson Borlaug (1859\u20131935) once told him, \"you're wiser to fill your head now if you want to fill your belly later on.\"[19] When Borlaug applied for admission to the University of Minnesota in 1933, he failed its entrance exam, but was accepted at the school's newly created two-year General College. After two quarters, he transferred to the College of Agriculture's forestry program. As a member of the University of Minnesota men's wrestling team, Borlaug reached the Big Ten semifinals, and promoted the sport to Minnesota high schools in exhibition matches all around the state./nWrestling taught me some valuable lessons... I always figured I could hold my own against the best in the world. It made me tough. Many times, I drew on that strength. It's an inappropriate crutch perhaps, but that's the way I'm made.[20]/nTo finance his studies, Borlaug put his education on hold periodically to earn some income, as he did in 1935 as a leader in the Civilian Conservation Corps, working with the unemployed on federal projects. Many of the people who worked for him were starving. He later recalled, \"I saw how food changed them. All of this left scars on me\".[21] From 1935 to 1938, before and after receiving his Bachelor of Science in forestry in 1937, Borlaug worked for the United States Forest Service at stations in Massachusetts and Idaho. He spent one summer in the middle fork of Idaho's Salmon River, the most isolated piece of wilderness in the nation at that time.[21]/nIn the last months of his undergraduate education, Borlaug attended a Sigma Xi lecture by Elvin Charles Stakman, a professor and soon-to-be head of the plant pathology group at the University of Minnesota. The event was a pivot for Borlaug's future. Stakman, in his speech entitled \"These Shifty Little Enemies that Destroy our Food Crops\", discussed the manifestation of the plant disease rust, a parasitic fungus that feeds on phytonutrients in wheat, oats, and barley crops. Stakman had discovered that special plant breeding methods produced plants resistant to rust. His research greatly interested Borlaug, and when Borlaug's job at the Forest Service was eliminated because of budget cuts, he asked Stakman if he should go into forest pathology. Stakman advised him to focus on plant pathology instead.[20] He subsequently enrolled at the university to study plant pathology under Stakman. Borlaug earned a Master of Science degree in 1940, and a Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics in 1942./nBorlaug was a member of the Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity. While in college, he met his future wife, Margaret Gibson, as he waited tables at a coffee shop in the university's  Dinkytown, where the two worked. They were married in 1937 and had three children, Norma Jean \"Jeanie\" Laube, Scotty (who died from spina bifida soon after birth), and William; five grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren. On March 8, 2007, Margaret Borlaug died at the age of 95 following a fall.[22] They had been married for 69 years. Borlaug resided in Dallas the last years of his life, although his global humanitarian efforts left him with only a few weeks of the year to spend there.[21]/nFrom 1942 to 1944, Borlaug was employed as a microbiologist at DuPont in Wilmington, Delaware. It was planned that he would lead research on industrial and agricultural bacteriocides, fungicides, and preservatives. However, following the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor Borlaug tried to enlist in the military, but was rejected under wartime labor regulations; his lab was converted to conduct research for the United States armed forces. One of his first projects was to develop glue that could withstand the warm salt water of the South Pacific. The Imperial Japanese Navy had gained control of the island of Guadalcanal, and patrolled the sky and sea by day. The only way for U.S. forces to supply the troops stranded on the island was to approach at night by speedboat, and jettison boxes of canned food and other supplies into the surf to wash ashore. The problem was that the glue holding these containers together disintegrated in saltwater. Within weeks, Borlaug and his colleagues had developed an adhesive that resisted corrosion, allowing food and supplies to reach the stranded Marines. Other tasks included work with camouflage; canteen disinfectants; DDT to control malaria; and insulation for small electronics.[21]/nIn 1940, the Avila Camacho administration took office in Mexico. The administration's primary goal for Mexican agriculture was augmenting the nation's industrialization and economic growth. U.S. Vice President-Elect Henry Wallace, who was instrumental in persuading the Rockefeller Foundation to work with the Mexican government in agricultural development, saw Avila Camacho's ambitions as beneficial to U.S. economic and military interests.[23] The Rockefeller Foundation contacted E.C. Stakman and two other leading agronomists. They developed a proposal for a new organization, the Office of Special Studies, as part of the Mexican Government, but directed by the Rockefeller Foundation. It was to be staffed with both Mexican and US scientists, focusing on soil development, maize and wheat production, and plant pathology./nStakman chose Dr. Jacob George \"Dutch\" Harrar as project leader. Harrar immediately set out to hire Borlaug as head of the newly established Cooperative Wheat Research and Production Program in Mexico; Borlaug declined, choosing to finish his war service at DuPont.[24] In July 1944, after rejecting DuPont's offer to double his salary, and temporarily leaving behind his pregnant wife and 14-month-old daughter, he flew to Mexico City to head the new program as a geneticist and plant pathologist.[21]/nIn 1964, Borlaug was made the director of the International Wheat Improvement Program at El Bat\u00e1n, Texcoco, on the eastern fringes of Mexico City, as part of the newly established Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research's International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Ma\u00edz y Trigo, or CIMMYT). Funding for this autonomous international research training institute developed from the Cooperative Wheat Research Production Program was undertaken jointly by the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations and the Mexican government./nBesides his work in genetic resistance against crop loss, Borlaug felt that pesticides including DDT had more benefits than drawbacks for humanity and advocated publicly for their continued use. He continued to support pesticide use despite the severe public criticism he received for it.[25][26] Borlaug mostly admired the work and personality of Rachel Carson but lamented her Silent Spring, what he saw as an inaccurate portrayal of the effects of DDT.[27]/nBorlaug retired officially from the position in 1979, but remained a CIMMYT senior consultant. In addition to taking up charitable and educational roles, he continued to be involved in plant research at CIMMYT with wheat, triticale, barley, maize, and high-altitude sorghum./nIn 1981, Borlaug became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.[28]/nIn 1984, Borlaug began teaching and conducting research at Texas A&M University. Eventually he was given the title Distinguished Professor of International Agriculture at the university and the holder of the Eugene Butler Endowed Chair in Agricultural Biotechnology./nHe advocated for agricultural biotechnology as he had for pesticides in earlier decades: publicly, knowledgeably, and always despite heavy criticism.[29][26]/nBorlaug served on the faculty of the University of Minnesota, University of Iowa, Cornell University, and Texas A&M University. Borlaug remained at A&M until his death in September 2009./nThe Cooperative Wheat Research Production Program, a joint venture by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Mexican Ministry of Agriculture, involved research in genetics, plant breeding, plant pathology, entomology, agronomy, soil science, and cereal technology. The goal of the project was to boost wheat production in Mexico, which at the time was importing a large portion of its grain. Plant pathologist George Harrar recruited and assembled the wheat research team in late 1944. The four other members were soil scientist William Colwell; maize breeder Edward Wellhausen; potato breeder John Niederhauser; and Norman Borlaug, all from the United States.[30] During the sixteen years Borlaug remained with the project, he bred a series of remarkably successful high-yield, disease-resistant, semi-dwarf wheat./nBorlaug said that his first few years in Mexico were difficult. He lacked trained scientists and equipment. Local farmers were hostile towards the wheat program because of serious crop losses from 1939 to 1941 due to stem rust. \"It often appeared to me that I had made a dreadful mistake in accepting the position in Mexico,\" he wrote in the epilogue to his book, Norman Borlaug on World Hunger.[21] He spent the first ten years breeding wheat cultivars resistant to disease, including rust. In that time, his group made 6,000 individual crossings of wheat.[31]/nInitially, Borlaug's work had been concentrated in the central highlands, in the village of Chapingo near Texcoco, where the problems with rust and poor soil were most prevalent. The village never met their aims. He realized that he could speed up breeding by taking advantage of the country's two growing seasons. In the summer he would breed wheat in the central highlands as usual, then immediately take the seeds north to the Valle del Yaqui research station near Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n, Sonora. The difference in altitudes and temperatures would allow more crops to be grown each year.[citation needed]/nBorlaug's boss, George Harrar, was against this expansion. Besides the extra costs of doubling the work, Borlaug's plan went against a then-held principle of agronomy that has since been disproved. It was believed that to store energy for germination before being planted, seeds needed a rest period after harvesting. When Harrar vetoed his plan, Borlaug resigned. Elvin Stakman, who was visiting the project, calmed the situation, talking Borlaug into withdrawing his resignation and Harrar into allowing the double wheat season. As of 1945, wheat would then be bred at locations 700\u00a0miles (1000\u00a0km) apart, 10 degrees apart in latitude, and 8500\u00a0feet (2600\u00a0m) apart in altitude. This was called \"shuttle breeding\".[32]/nAs an unexpected benefit of the double wheat season, the new breeds did not have problems with photoperiodism. Normally, wheat varieties cannot adapt to new environments, due to the changing periods of sunlight. Borlaug later recalled, \"As it worked out, in the north, we were planting when the days were getting shorter, at low elevation and high temperature. Then we'd take the seed from the best plants south and plant it at high elevation, when days were getting longer and there was lots of rain. Soon we had varieties that fit the whole range of conditions. That wasn't supposed to happen by the books\".[31] This meant that the project would not need to start separate breeding programs for each geographic region of the planet./nBecause purebred (genotypically identical) plant varieties often only have one or a few major genes for disease resistance, and plant diseases such as rust are continuously producing new races that can overcome a pure line's resistance, multiple linear lines varieties were developed. Multiline varieties are mixtures of several phenotypically similar pure lines which each have different genes for disease resistance. By having similar heights, flowering and maturity dates, seed colors, and agronomic characteristics, they remain compatible with each other, and do not reduce yields when grown together on the field.[citation needed]/nIn 1953, Borlaug extended this technique by suggesting that several pure lines with different resistance genes should be developed through backcross methods using one recurrent parent.[33] Backcrossing involves crossing a hybrid and subsequent generations with a recurrent parent. As a result, the genotype of the backcrossed progeny becomes increasingly similar to that of the recurrent parent. Borlaug's method would allow the various different disease-resistant genes from several donor parents to be transferred into a single recurrent parent. To make sure each line has different resistant genes, each donor parent is used in a separate backcross program. Between five and ten of these lines may then be mixed depending upon the races of pathogen present in the region. As this process is repeated, some lines will become susceptible to the pathogen. These lines can easily be replaced with new resistant lines./nAs new sources of resistance become available, new lines are developed. In this way, the loss of crops is kept to a minimum, because only one or a few lines become susceptible to a pathogen within a given season, and all other crops are unaffected by the disease. Because the disease would spread more slowly than if the entire population were susceptible, this also reduces the damage to susceptible lines. There is still the possibility that a new race of pathogen will develop to which all lines are susceptible, however.[34]/nDwarfing is an important agronomic quality for wheat; dwarf plants produce thick stems. The cultivars Borlaug worked with had tall, thin stalks. Taller wheat grasses better compete for sunlight, but tend to collapse under the weight of the extra grain\u2014a trait called lodging\u2014from the rapid growth spurts induced by nitrogen fertilizer Borlaug used in the poor soil. To prevent this, he bred wheat to favor shorter, stronger stalks that could better support larger seed heads. In 1953, he acquired a Japanese dwarf variety of wheat called Norin 10 developed by the agronomist Gonjiro Inazuka in Iwate Prefecture, including ones which had been crossed with a high-yielding American cultivar called Brevor 14 by Orville Vogel.[35] Norin 10/Brevor 14 is semi-dwarf (one-half to two-thirds the height of standard varieties) and produces more stalks and thus more heads of grain per plant. Also, larger amounts of assimilate were partitioned into the actual grains, further increasing the yield. Borlaug crossbred the semi-dwarf Norin 10/Brevor 14 cultivar with his disease-resistant cultivars to produce wheat varieties that were adapted to tropical and sub-tropical climates.[36]/nBorlaug's new semi-dwarf, disease-resistant varieties, called Pitic 62 and Penjamo 62, changed the potential yield of spring wheat dramatically. By 1963, 95% of Mexico's wheat crops used the semi-dwarf varieties developed by Borlaug. That year, the harvest was six times larger than in 1944, the year Borlaug arrived in Mexico. Mexico had become fully self-sufficient in wheat production, and a net exporter of wheat.[37] Four other high-yield varieties were also released, in 1964: Lerma Rojo 64, Siete Cerros, Sonora 64, and Super X./nIn 1961 to 1962, Borlaug's dwarf spring wheat strains were sent for multilocation testing in the International Wheat Rust Nursery, organized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In March 1962, a few of these strains were grown in the fields of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute in Pusa, New Delhi, India. In May 1962, M. S. Swaminathan, a member of IARI's wheat program, requested of Dr B. P. Pal, director of IARI, to arrange for the visit of Borlaug to India and to obtain a wide range of dwarf wheat seed possessing the Norin 10 dwarfing genes.[citation needed] The letter was forwarded to the Indian Ministry of Agriculture headed by Shri C. Subramaniam, which arranged with the Rockefeller Foundation for Borlaug's visit./nIn March 1963, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Mexican government sent Borlaug and Dr Robert Glenn Anderson to India to continue his work. He supplied 100\u00a0kg (220\u00a0lb) of seed from each of the four most promising strains and 630 promising selections in advanced generations to the IARI in October 1963, and test plots were subsequently planted at Delhi, Ludhiana, Pant Nagar, Kanpur, Pune and Indore.[citation needed] Anderson stayed as head of the Rockefeller Foundation Wheat Program in New Delhi until 1975./nDuring the mid-1960s the Indian subcontinent was at war and experienced minor famine and starvation, which was limited partially by the U.S. shipping a fifth of its wheat production to India in 1966 and 1967.[30] The Indian and Pakistani bureaucracies and the region's cultural opposition to new agricultural techniques initially prevented Borlaug from fulfilling his desire to immediately plant the new wheat strains there. In 1965, as a response to food shortages, Borlaug imported 550 tons of seeds for the government.[21]/nBiologist Paul R. Ehrlich wrote in his 1968 bestseller The Population Bomb, \"The battle to feed all of humanity is over\u00a0... In the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now.\" Ehrlich said, \"I have yet to meet anyone familiar with the situation who thinks India will be self-sufficient in food by 1971,\" and \"India couldn't possibly feed two hundred million more people by 1980.\"[38]/nIn 1965, after extensive testing, Borlaug's team, under Anderson, began its effort by importing about 450\u00a0tons of Lerma Rojo and Sonora 64 semi-dwarf seed varieties: 250\u00a0tons went to Pakistan and 200 to India. They encountered many obstacles. Their first shipment of wheat was held up in Mexican customs and so it could not be shipped from the port at Guaymas in time for proper planting.[citation needed] Instead, it was sent via a 30-truck convoy from Mexico to the U.S. port in Los Angeles, encountering delays at the Mexico\u2013United States border. Once the convoy entered the U.S., it had to take a detour, as the U.S. National Guard had closed the freeway due to the Watts riots in Los Angeles. When the seeds reached Los Angeles, a Mexican bank refused to honor Pakistan treasury's payment of US$100,000, because the check contained three misspelled words. Still, the seed was loaded onto a freighter destined for Bombay, India, and Karachi, Pakistan. Twelve hours into the freighter's voyage, war broke out between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir region. Borlaug received a telegram from the Pakistani minister of agriculture, Malik Khuda Bakhsh Bucha: \"I'm sorry to hear you are having trouble with my check, but I've got troubles, too. Bombs are falling on my front lawn. Be patient, the money is in the bank...\"[21]/nThese delays prevented Borlaug's group from conducting the germination tests needed to determine seed quality and proper seeding levels. They started planting immediately and often worked in sight of artillery flashes. A week later, Borlaug discovered that his seeds were germinating at less than half the normal rate.[citation needed] It later turned out that the seeds had been damaged in a Mexican warehouse by over-fumigation with a pesticide. He immediately ordered all locations to double their seeding rates.[39]/nThe initial yields of Borlaug's crops were higher than any ever harvested in South Asia. The countries subsequently committed to importing large quantities of both the Lerma Rojo 64 and Sonora 64 varieties. In 1966, India imported 18,000\u00a0tons\u2014the largest purchase and import of any seed in the world at that time. In 1967, Pakistan imported 42,000\u00a0tons, and Turkey 21,000\u00a0tons. Pakistan's import, planted on 1.5 million acres (6,100\u00a0km2), produced enough wheat to seed the entire nation's wheatland the following year.[30] By 1968, when Ehrlich's book was released, William Gaud of the United States Agency for International Development was calling Borlaug's work a \"Green Revolution\". High yields led to a shortage of various utilities\u2014labor to harvest the crops, bullock carts to haul it to the threshing floor, jute bags, trucks, rail cars, and grain storage facilities. Some local governments were forced to close school buildings temporarily to use them for grain storage.[21]/nIn Pakistan, wheat yields nearly doubled, from 4.6 million tons in 1965 to 7.3 million tons in 1970; Pakistan was self-sufficient in wheat production by 1968.[citation needed] Yields were over 21 million tons by 2000. In India, yields increased from 12.3 million tons in 1965 to 20.1 million tons in 1970. By 1974, India was self-sufficient in the production of all cereals. By 2000, India was harvesting a record 76.4 million tons (2.81 billion bushels) of wheat. Since the 1960s, food production in both nations has increased faster than the rate of population growth.[citation needed] India's use of high-yield farming has prevented an estimated 100 million acres (400,000\u00a0km2) of virgin land from being converted into farmland\u2014an area about the size of California, or 13.6% of the total area of India.[40] The use of these wheat varieties has also had a substantial effect on production in six Latin American countries, six countries in the Near and Middle East, and several others in Africa.[citation needed]/nBorlaug's work with wheat contributed to the development of high-yield semi-dwarf indica and japonica rice cultivars at the International Rice Research Institute and China's Hunan Rice Research Institute. Borlaug's colleagues at the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research also developed and introduced a high-yield variety of rice throughout most of Asia. Land devoted to the semi-dwarf wheat and rice varieties in Asia expanded from 200\u00a0acres (0.8\u00a0km2) in 1965 to over 40 million acres (160,000\u00a0km2) in 1970. In 1970, this land accounted for over 10% of the more productive cereal land in Asia.[30]/nFor his contributions to the world food supply, Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970. Norwegian officials notified his wife in Mexico City at 4:00\u00a0a.m., but Borlaug had already left for the test fields in the Toluca valley, about 40\u00a0miles (65\u00a0km) west of Mexico City. A chauffeur took her to the fields to inform her husband. According to his daughter, Jeanie Laube, \"My mom said, 'You won the Nobel Peace Prize,' and he said, 'No, I haven't',\u00a0... It took some convincing\u00a0... He thought the whole thing was a hoax\".[21] He was awarded the prize on December 10./nIn his Nobel Lecture the following day, he speculated on his award: \"When the Nobel Peace Prize Committee designated me the recipient of the 1970 award for my contribution to the 'green revolution', they were in effect, I believe, selecting an individual to symbolize the vital role of agriculture and food production in a world that is hungry, both for bread and for peace\".[41] His speech repeatedly presented improvements in food production within a sober understanding of the context of population.  \"The green revolution has won a temporary success in man's war against hunger and deprivation; it has given man a breathing space. If fully implemented, the revolution can provide sufficient food for sustenance during the next three decades. But the frightening power of human reproduction must also be curbed; otherwise the success of the green revolution will be ephemeral only./n\"Most people still fail to comprehend the magnitude and menace of the \"Population Monster\"...Since man is potentially a rational being, however, I am confident that within the next two decades he will recognize the self-destructive course he steers along the road of irresponsible population growth...\"[42]/nBorlaug continually advocated increasing crop yields as a means to curb deforestation. The large role he played in both increasing crop yields and promoting this view has led to this methodology being called by agricultural economists the \"Borlaug hypothesis\", namely that increasing the productivity of agriculture on the best farmland can help control deforestation by reducing the demand for new farmland. According to this view, assuming that global food demand is on the rise, restricting crop usage to traditional low-yield methods would also require at least one of the following: the world population to decrease, either voluntarily or as a result of mass starvations; or the conversion of forest land into crop land. It is thus argued that high-yield techniques are ultimately saving ecosystems from destruction. On a global scale, this view holds strictly true ceteris paribus, if deforestation only occurs to increase land for agriculture. But other land uses exist, such as urban areas, pasture, or fallow, so further research is necessary to ascertain what land has been converted for what purposes, to determine how true this view remains.[according to whom?]/nIncreased profits from high-yield production may also induce cropland expansion in any case, although as world food needs decrease, this expansion may decrease as well.[43]/nBorlaug expressed the idea now known as the \"Borlaug hypothesis\" in a speech given in Oslo, Norway, in 2000, upon the occasion of the 30th anniversary of his acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize: \"Had the global cereal yields of 1950 still prevailed in 1999, we would have needed nearly 1.8 billion ha of additional land of the same quality \u2013 instead of the 600 million that was used \u2013 to equal the current global harvest\".[44]/nBorlaug's name is nearly synonymous with the Green Revolution, against which many criticisms have been mounted over the decades. Throughout his years of research, Borlaug's programs often faced opposition by nonscientists who consider genetic crossbreeding to be unnatural or to have negative effects.[45] These farming techniques, in addition to increasing yields, often reaped large profits for U.S. agribusiness and agrochemical corporations and were criticized by one author in 2003 as widening social inequality in the countries owing to uneven food distribution while forcing a capitalist agenda of U.S. corporations onto countries that had undergone land reform.[46]/nOther concerns include the crossing of genetic barriers; the inability of a single crop to fulfill all nutritional requirements; the decreased biodiversity from planting a small number of varieties; the environmental and economic effects of inorganic fertilizer and pesticides; the side effects of large amounts of herbicides sprayed on fields of herbicide-resistant crops; and the destruction of wilderness caused by the construction of roads in populated third-world areas.[47]/nBorlaug refuted or dismissed most claims of his critics, but did take certain concerns seriously. He stated that his work has been \"a change in the right direction, but it has not transformed the world into a Utopia\".[48] Of environmental lobbyists opposing crop yield improvements, he stated, \"some of the environmental lobbyists of the Western nations are the salt of the earth, but many of them are elitists. They've never experienced the physical sensation of hunger. They do their lobbying from comfortable office suites in Washington or Brussels. If they lived just one month amid the misery of the developing world, as I have for fifty years, they'd be crying out for tractors and fertilizer and irrigation canals and be outraged that fashionable elitists back home were trying to deny them these things\".[49] Borlaug cautioned, \"There are no miracles in agricultural production. Nor is there such a thing as a miracle variety of wheat, rice, or maize which can serve as an elixir to cure all ills of a stagnant, traditional agriculture.\"[50]/nThe journalist John Vidal, writing in The Guardian, commented that the plaudits and honors heaped on Borlaug present him as a \"a saint or even the god of American farmers\",[51] but that the technology was far from perfect. The Green Revolution promised to end hunger and poverty, and to benefit rural societies everywhere. Instead, its long-term effects included what the Indian environmentalist Vandana Shiva has called \"rural impoverishment, increased debt, social inequality and the displacement of vast numbers of peasant farmers\".[51] Vidal further cites the political commentator Alexander Cockburn, who wrote that Borlaug was \"probably the biggest killer of all to have got the peace prize\", given that his wheat \"led to the death of peasants by the million.\"[51]/nFollowing his retirement, Borlaug continued to participate in teaching, research and activism. He spent much of the year based at CIMMYT in Mexico, conducting research, and four months of the year serving at Texas A&M University, where he had been a distinguished professor of international agriculture since 1984. From 1994 to 2003, Borlaug served on the International Fertilizer Development Center board of directors. In 1999, the university's Board of Regents named its US$16 million Center for Southern Crop Improvement in honor of Borlaug. He worked in the building's Heep Center, and taught one semester each year.[21]/nIn the early 1980s, environmental groups that were opposed to Borlaug's methods campaigned against his planned expansion of efforts into Africa. They prompted the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations and the World Bank to stop funding most of his African agriculture projects. Western European governments were persuaded to stop supplying fertilizer to Africa. According to David Seckler, former Director General of the International Water Management Institute, \"the environmental community in the 1980s went crazy pressuring the donor countries and the big foundations not to support ideas like inorganic fertilizers for Africa.\"[40]/nIn 1984, during the Ethiopian famine, Ryoichi Sasakawa, the chairman of the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation (now the Nippon Foundation), contacted the semi-retired Borlaug, wondering why the methods used in Asia were not extended to Africa, and hoping Borlaug could help. He convinced Borlaug to help with this new effort,[52] and Borlaug assisted in creating the Sasakawa Africa Association (SAA) to coordinate the project./nThe SAA is a research and extension organization that aims to increase food production in African countries that are struggling with food shortages. \"I assumed we'd do a few years of research first,\" Borlaug later recalled, \"but after I saw the terrible circumstances there, I said, 'Let's just start growing'.\"[40] Soon, Borlaug and the SAA had projects in seven countries. Yields of maize in developed African countries tripled. Yields of wheat, sorghum, cassava, and cowpeas also increased in these countries.[40] At present (more than ten years after Borlaug's death in 2009), program activities are under way in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda, all of which suffered from repeated famines in previous decades./nFrom 1986 to 2009, Borlaug was the President of the SAA. That year, a joint venture between The Carter Center and SAA was launched called Sasakawa-Global 2000 (SG 2000).[53] The program focuses on food, population and agricultural policy.[54] Since then, more than 8 million small-scale farmers in 15 African countries have been trained in SAA farming techniques, which have helped them to double or triple grain production.[55] Those elements that allowed Borlaug's projects to succeed in India and Pakistan, such as well-organized market economies, transportation, and irrigation systems, are severely lacking throughout much of Africa, posing additional obstacles to increasing yields and reducing the ongoing threat of food shortages. Because of these challenges, Borlaug's initial projects were restricted to relatively developed regions of the continent./nDespite these setbacks, Borlaug found encouragement. Visiting Ethiopia in 1994 after a major famine, Jimmy Carter won Prime Minister Meles Zenawi's support for a campaign seeking to aid farmers, using the fertilizer diammonium phosphate and Borlaug's methods. The following season, Ethiopia recorded the largest harvests of major crops in history, with a 32% increase in production, and a 15% increase in average yield over the previous season. For Borlaug, the rapid increase in yields suggested that there was still hope for higher food production throughout sub-Saharan Africa,[40] despite lingering questions about population sustainability and the absence of long-term studies in Africa./nThe World Food Prize is an international award recognizing the achievements of individuals who have advanced human development by improving the quality, quantity or availability of food in the world. The prize was created in 1986 by Norman Borlaug, as a way to recognize personal accomplishments, and as a means of education by using the Prize to establish role models for others. The first prize was given to Borlaug's former colleague, M. S. Swaminathan, in 1987, for his work in India. The next year, Swaminathan used the US$250,000 prize to start the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation for research on sustainable development./nIn 2005, Borlaug, with his former graduate student Ronnie Coffman, convened an international expert panel in Kenya on the emerging threat of Ug99 in east Africa.[56] The working group produced a report, \"Sounding the Alarm on Global Stem Rust\", and their work led to the formation of the Global Rust Initiative. In 2008, with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the organization was re-named the Borlaug Global Rust Initiative[57]/nThe limited potential for land expansion for cultivation worried Borlaug, who, in March 2005, stated that, \"we will have to double the world food supply by 2050.\" With 85% of future growth in food production having to come from lands already in use, he recommends a multidisciplinary research focus to further increase yields, mainly through increased crop immunity to large-scale diseases, such as the rust fungus, which affects all cereals but rice. His dream was to \"transfer rice immunity to cereals such as wheat, maize, sorghum and barley, and transfer bread-wheat proteins (gliadin and glutenin) to other cereals, especially rice and maize\".[58]/nBorlaug believed that genetically modified organisms (GMO) were the only way to increase food production as the world runs out of unused arable land. GMOs were not inherently dangerous \"because we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds.\"[59]\nIn a review of Borlaug's 2000 publication entitled Ending world hunger: the promise of biotechnology and the threat of antiscience zealotry,[60] the authors argued that Borlaug's warnings were still true in 2010,[61]/nGM crops are as natural and safe as today's bread wheat, opined Dr. Borlaug, who also reminded agricultural scientists of their\nmoral obligation to stand up to the antiscience crowd and warn policy makers that global food insecurity will not disappear without this new technology and ignoring this reality global food insecurity would make future solutions all the more difficult to achieve./nAccording to Borlaug, \"Africa, the former Soviet republics, and the cerrado are the last frontiers. After they are in use, the world will have no additional sizable blocks of arable land left to put into production, unless you are willing to level whole forests, which you should not do. So, future food-production increases will have to come from higher yields. And though I have no doubt yields will keep going up, whether they can go up enough to feed the population monster is another matter. Unless progress with agricultural yields remains very strong, the next century will experience sheer human misery that, on a numerical scale, will exceed the worst of everything that has come before\".[40]/nBesides increasing the worldwide food supply, early in his career Borlaug stated that taking steps to decrease the rate of population growth will also be necessary to prevent food shortages. In his Nobel Lecture of 1970, Borlaug stated, \"Most people still fail to comprehend the magnitude and menace of the 'Population Monster'\u00a0... If it continues to increase at the estimated present rate of two percent a year, the world population will reach 6.5 billion by the year 2000. Currently, with each second, or tick of the clock, about 2.2 additional people are added to the world population. The rhythm of increase will accelerate to 2.7, 3.3, and 4.0 for each tick of the clock by 1980, 1990, and 2000, respectively, unless man becomes more realistic and preoccupied about this impending doom. The tick-tock of the clock will continually grow louder and more menacing each decade. Where will it all end?\"[41] However, some observers have suggested that by the 1990s Borlaug had changed his position on population control. They point to a quote from the year 2000 in which he stated: \"I now say that the world has the technology\u2014either available or well advanced in the research pipeline\u2014to feed on a sustainable basis a population of 10 billion people. The more pertinent question today is whether farmers and ranchers will be permitted to use this new technology? While the affluent nations can certainly afford to adopt ultra low-risk positions, and pay more for food produced by the so-called 'organic' methods, the one billion chronically undernourished people of the low income, food-deficit nations cannot.\"[62] However, Borlaug remained on the advisory board of Population Media Center, an organization working to stabilize world population, until his death.[63]/nBorlaug died of lymphoma at the age of 95, on September 12, 2009, in his Dallas home.[2][64][4]/nBorlaug's children released a statement saying, \"We would like his life to be a model for making a difference in the lives of others and to bring about efforts to end human misery for all mankind.\"[65]/nThe Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh and President of India Pratibha Patil paid tribute to Borlaug saying, \"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress.\"[66]/nThe United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) described Borlaug as \"a towering scientist whose work rivals that of the 20th century's other great scientific benefactors of humankind\"[67] and Kofi Annan, former Secretary-General of the United Nations said, \"As we celebrate Dr. Borlaug's long and remarkable life, we also celebrate the long and productive lives that his achievements have made possible for so many millions of people around the world... we will continue to be inspired by his enduring devotion to the poor, needy and vulnerable of our world.\"[68]/nIn 1968, Borlaug received what he considered an especially satisfying tribute when the people of Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n, where some of his earliest experiments were undertaken, named a street after him. Also in that year, he became a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences./nIn 1970, he was given an honorary doctorate by the Agricultural University of Norway.[69]/nIn 1970, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize by the Norwegian Nobel Committee \"for his contributions to the 'green revolution' that was having such an impact on food production particularly in Asia and in Latin America.\"[69]/nIn 1970, he was awarded the Order of the Aztec Eagle by the Mexican government.[70]/nIn 1971, he was named a Distinguished Fellow of the National Academy of Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine of Argentina[71]/nIn 1971, he received the American Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award.[72]/nIn 1974, he was awarded a Peace Medal (in the form of a dove, carrying a wheat ear in its beak) by Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar, India./nIn 1975, he was named a Distinguished Fellow of the Iowa Academy of Science.[73]/nIn 1980, he received the S.

Gall's studies were greatly facilitated by his knowledge of many different organisms because he could select the most favorable organism to study when approaching a specific question about nuclear structure. He was awarded the 2006 Albert Lasker Special Achievement Award.[1] He was also a co-recipient (with Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol W. Greider) of the 2007 Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University. In 1983 he was honored with the highest recognition of the American Society for Cell Biology, the E. B. Wilson Medal. He had been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1968,[2] the National Academy of Sciences in 1972,[3] and the American Philosophical Society in 1989.[4]/nGall was called \"the father of cell biology\" in his citation for the Lasker award.[5] Gall was a major contributor to the theory that a chromosome contained one DNA molecule running from one end to the other.  In chromosomes after DNA replication, each of the two daughter chromatids had one DNA molecule running its length.  He revealed this structure by examining amphibian lampbrush chromosomes in the microscope after staining for DNA and for RNA and also after treatment with enzymes that break down DNA or RNA.  Although the Feulgen stain for DNA was not sensitive enough to stain the DNA in the loops of these chromosomes, but only stained the long axis of the structure, the loops were sensitive to DNase so they must contain DNA that maintained their loop structure.  Later, staining with DAPI, a more sensitive dye, revealed the DNA running through each loop and then returning to the axis of the chromosome.[6] He also unveiled the structure and location of the rDNA, the part of the genome that specifies the ribosomal RNA and made many more important discoveries about nuclear structure.[7]/nGall and then-graduate student Mary-Lou Pardue wanted to find out where in the chromosomes a distinctive highly repeated DNA sequence called satellite DNA occurred.  To show the location of this special DNA, they developed the widely used laboratory technique known as in situ hybridization.[8][5] Using this method, they found that satellite DNA occurred at the ends or telomeres of the chromosomes.[8]/nWhen Elizabeth Blackburn, 2009 Nobel laureate in Medicine, worked with Gall they analyzed the ends of chromosomes and identified the major short repeated sequence that occurs in telomeres of most higher organisms.  Blackburn and her student Carol Greider later discovered the enzyme telomerase that maintains the lengths of the protective telomeric sequences and identified its role in aging.[7]/nJoseph Gall currently heads the Gall Lab, a component of the Department of Embryology in the Carnegie Institution for Science, in Maryland.[9]/nGall is credited with encouraging women biologists, a group sometimes called \"Gall's Gals\", in an era when this was relatively uncommon.[10]  A number of his former students have been elected to the National Academy of Sciences and won major research prizes including the Nobel Prize.

She co\u2014wrote an article about Gall's life and work in 2003.[11] In her conversations with Gall, when asked to explain his encouragement of women in the sciences, he spoke about his mother. Gifted in math and science, she had been the first woman in her family to attend college, graduating in the 1920s. She became a homemaker, not a scientist. But she urged a young Joseph Gall to explore the natural world, encouraging him to catch bugs and bring them into the house so together they could identify the creatures using scientific reference books. \"It never occurred to me that a woman's aptitude was different than a man's,\" Gall said. \"My father -- a lawyer -- was afraid of animals and insects. So, if anything, maybe I thought it went the other way.\".[10]/nIn 2005, Gall was featured in a series of interviews with well-known television personality, Bill Nye, for the Science Channel's 100 Greatest Discoveries series.[12]", "22066292": "Junying Yu (born 1975) is a Chinese stem cell biologist.

He had transformed the fields of molecular medicine by his discovery of the ability of metabolites to form ordered supramolecular assemblies, denoted as \"metabolite amyloids\", which share common biological, chemical, and physical characteristics. He provided evidence that these assemblies are associated with human disease, evoke an immunological response, and that their cerebral deposition is observed post mortem. This discovery resulted in a paradigm shift in the study of amyloid self-assembly, inborn errors of metabolism disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. This achievement is a far-reaching extension of the concept of protein aggregation to include a significantly larger class of biomolecules that form generic, thermodynamically favorable, nano-architectures of a notable pathological role./nThis discovery was a directed continuation of his achievements in the study of protein amyloids, including the pioneering mechanistic characterization of the self-assembly of amyloid structures by extremely short peptide fragments, the identification of oligomeric assemblies, and the development of inhibition technologies. His work also led to the development of a branch of peptide nanotechnology that is currently being studied by hundreds of research groups around the world. This activity involves the discovery of a novel class of peptide nanostructures with unique physical properties that are useful for numerous technological applications. His work resulted in the identification of minimal recognition elements that facilitate the assembly of amyloid fibrils and identified novel ways to inhibit this process.[6] His laboratory was the first to identify aromatic dipeptides that form nanotubes and nanospheres of unique mechanical and chemical properties.[7] The applications of these nano-assemblies for ultra-sensitive biosensors applications, energy-storage devices, and the fabrication of metallic nanowires were demonstrated./nHis work was published in more than 350 publications in some of the most prestigious academic journals including Science,[8] Nature Nanotechnology,[9] Nature Chemical Biology, Nature Physics, Nature Catalysis, Cell, the Proceedings of the US National Academy of Sciences,[10] and many more.

She served as the Dean of the New York Congressional Delegation for the last few terms as Congresswoman before her death./nSlaughter was born in Lynch, Kentucky. She studied microbiology and public health at the University of Kentucky, earning both Bachelor's and Master's degrees. After moving to New York and becoming involved in politics as a member of the Democratic Party, she was elected to a seat in the New York State Assembly in 1982 and to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1986. Slaughter represented Rochester and most of surrounding Monroe County; she represented the 30th District from 1987 to 1993, the 28th District from 1993 to 2013, and the 25th district from 2013 until her death, often serving as the only microbiologist in Congress./nSlaughter served as Chair of the House Rules Committee from 2007 until 2011, and as ranking minority member of the Committee from 2005 to 2007, and from 2011 until her death.[1] Slaughter was the lead House sponsor of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, which became law in 2008. Along with Senator Joe Biden she co-sponsored the Violence Against Women Act. At the time of her death, Slaughter was the oldest sitting member of Congress and the last sitting member born in the 1920s.[2]/nSlaughter was born Dorothy Louise McIntosh on August 14, 1929, in Lynch, Kentucky, a coal mining town built by a subsidiary of U.S. Steel. She was the daughter of Daisy Grace (n\u00e9e Byers; 1903\u20131987)[3] and Oscar Lewis McIntosh (1901\u20131987),[4] a blacksmith for a coal mine.[5] She had two brothers, Philip and David, as well as two sisters, Marjorie and Virginia. Her sister Virginia died of pneumonia while she was a child; Slaughter later cited this as her reason for earning degrees in microbiology and public health.[6] The family moved to Monticello, Kentucky, in Wayne County, and Slaughter graduated from Somerset High School, in adjoining Pulaski County./nSlaughter graduated from high school and enrolled at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, Kentucky, where she studied microbiology. Inspired by the loss of her sister to pneumonia when they were children,[7] she earned a bachelor's degree in bacteriology and went on to earn a master's degree in public health, also from the University of Kentucky.[8] Her master's thesis focused on the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, completed in 1954. After graduate school, Slaughter went to work for Procter & Gamble in New York doing market research.[9]/nAlready involved in community groups like the scouts and the League of Women Voters, Slaughter became increasingly concerned with local political and community issues.[citation needed]  She was involved in a local environmental group, the Perinton Greenlands Association, which promoted recycling and opposed development of Hart's Woods.[citation needed] Slaughter decided to run for the Monroe County Legislature, winning on her third try.[citation needed] In 1975, while in the county legislature, she accepted an offer from then-New York Secretary of State Mario Cuomo to serve as his regional coordinator in the Rochester area. When Cuomo was elected lieutenant governor in 1979, Slaughter stayed on as his Rochester regional coordinator.[10]/nIn 1982, local Democratic supporters approached Slaughter with a desire to see her run to represent the 130th District in the New York State Assembly against the Republican incumbent, Thomas A. Hanna. Slaughter challenged Hanna, and she won with 52 percent of the vote.[11] In 1984, she ran for reelection against the Republican and Conservative parties' candidate Donald S. Milton.[12] She was re-elected with 55 percent of the vote.[12] Slaughter sat in the 185th and 186th New York State Legislatures.[10]/nAfter four years in the Assembly, Slaughter decided to run for the Democratic nomination in New York's 30th congressional district. At the time, the district included downtown and eastern Rochester, most of eastern Monroe County, all of Genesee County and northern Livingston and Ontario counties. Moderate Republican Barber Conable had represented the district for 20 years before giving way in 1985 to a considerably more conservative Republican, Fred J. Eckert. Slaughter defeated Eckert by one point in the 1986 midterm election.[6]/nAfter becoming the first Democrat to represent the district since 1963, Slaughter ran against a young member of the Monroe Country Legislature, 33-year old John D. Bouchard. As her district continued its transition from a Republican stronghold, her supporters came out in droves in the 1988 Congressional Election, with her gaining nearly 40,000 more votes than she did in 1986, winning with 56.9% of the vote. Her opponent John D. Bouchard, received one of the highest vote totals tallied against Slaughter for the duration of her time in Washington./nRedistricting after the 1990 census renumbered Slaughter's district as the 28th District and turned it into a much more compact district comprising a narrow ribbon in Monroe County. In the process, she picked up the remainder of Rochester. At the same time, the neighboring 29th District of 30-year incumbent Republican Frank Horton, a close friend of Slaughter's, was dismantled, and his home was drawn into the new 28th.  The district had already been moving away from its moderate Republican roots, but the new territory made the district solidly Democratic.  Horton opted to retire rather than run against Slaughter.[13]/nAfter the 2000 census, much of her district was merged with the 29th District of fellow Democratic Representative John LaFalce, which included Niagara Falls and the northern third of Buffalo. Original plans called for LaFalce's district to be merged with that of Republican Jack Quinn, who represented the other side of Buffalo. The new district retained Slaughter's district number, but was geographically more LaFalce's district. Only a thin tendril in Orleans County connected Rochester to Buffalo. However, LaFalce did not seek a 15th term, effectively handing the seat to Slaughter.[14]/nFollowing the 2010 census, Slaughter's district was renumbered as the 25th District. It was significantly more compact than its predecessor, as it took in most of Monroe County and lost its territory near Buffalo. However, it was also slightly less Democratic than her former territory. While President Barack Obama carried the old 28th with 69 percent of the vote, he only received 59 percent of the vote in the new 25th.[15] She faced a vigorous challenge from Republican Monroe County Executive Maggie Brooks, but Slaughter won a 14th term with 57.4% of the vote, on November 6, 2012.[16]/nIn the 2014 election, Slaughter narrowly defeated her Republican opponent, Gates town supervisor Mark Assini, by 869 votes. After an extended period of vote counting, Assini conceded defeat on November 12, 2014, more than a week after the election was held.[17][18]  It was the first close race that Slaughter had faced since her initial bid for the seat. In a 2016 rematch against Assini, Slaughter prevailed by a 55.7%-44.3% margin.[19]/nIn January 1987, Slaughter entered Congress. During her entire tenure, she was a \"fierce advocate\" for medical research, women's health, neurology and genetic rights.[20] In 1993, as a member of the United States House Committee on the Budget Slaughter secured the first $500 million earmarked by Congress for breast cancer research at the National Institutes of Health. Slaughter was also a co-sponsor of the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993, and fought to ensure the legislation included language guaranteeing that women and minorities were included in all federal health clinical trials from that point forward.[21] Previously, all NIH-funded research was done on white males, even in trials related to predominantly female diseases such as breast cancer.[22] Slaughter fought to include language establishing an Office of Research on Women's Health at NIH in the legislation. Ten years after the creation of ORWH, the National Institutes of Health awarded Slaughter its \"Visionary for Women's Health Research\" award.[23]/nIn 1994, along with Senator Joe Biden, Slaughter co-authored the Violence Against Women Act which is designed to reduce incidences of domestic violence in the United States and provide resources to victims.[6]/nAlong with Senator Christopher Dodd (D-CT), she introduced the Women's Progress Commemoration Act which established the Women's Progress Commemorative Commission in 1998.[24]/nAfter the 2006 mid-term takeover of the House by the Democratic Party, Slaughter was chosen to serve as Chairwoman of the United States House Committee on Rules at the start of the 110th Congress. She was the first woman in history to chair the Rules Committee, and she served in that capacity until 2011.[1]/nIn 2007, Slaughter introduced the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act (PAMTA), which would limit the use of antibiotics in livestock feed, to counter the threat of antibiotic resistant bacteria.[25] She has reintroduced her legislation in every subsequent session of Congress. The legislation would phase out the use of eight major classes of antibiotics in healthy food-producing animals, while allowing their use for treatment of sick animals.[26] She cited her scientific training as the impetus for her dedicated interest on the topic, stating in an interview, \"It wasn't that I was far-seeing then that they were going to use antibiotics in agriculture.

She introduced the bill repeatedly over a period of 14 years before it was signed into law on May 21, 2008. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act is designed to prohibit discrimination by employers or health insurers based upon an individual's genetic information.[28]/nIn 2009, Slaughter wrote to the United States Department of Defense requesting an investigation into faulty body armor after reading an article in The New York Times, entitled, \"Pentagon Study Links Fatalities to Body Armor.\" The article authored by Michael Moss reported that up to 80 percent of Marines who were killed in Iraq from wounds to the upper body could have survived if they had extra body armor. Slaughter's request resulted in the Department of Defense launching an investigation, recalling 16,000 pieces of body armor and replacing them with safer armor.[29]/nSlaughter was chairwoman of the United States House Committee on Rules during the writing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and managed the rule for the legislation on the House Floor. In March 2010, Slaughter proposed that a House rule be passed to expedite the passage of health care reform legislation. The rule allows the House to deem the Senate version of the health care reform bill \"already passed\" by the House without the House holding a recorded vote on the bill. Critics, who called the strategy the \"Slaughter Solution\", charged this proposed strategy was an affront to democratic principles and challenged its constitutionality.[30] Ultimately this legislative strategy was never used to pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act through the House.[31] Supporters observed that the courts had affirmed the rule's constitutionality, and that Republicans had used the rule repeatedly to pass major legislation such as the Patriot Act and the Tax Relief Reconciliation Act.[32][33][34]/nIn 2011, Slaughter secured $62.5 million in federal funding for the Laboratory for Laser Energetics at University of Rochester. Slaughter's efforts to secure funds for her district was recognized by the Rochester Institute of Technology when it named its Center for Integrated Manufacturing Studies facilities in her honor. During the same year, with the potential of a government shutdown looming, Slaughter referenced H.R. 358, introduced by Rep. Joseph Pitts during the 112th Congress,[35] when she said at a pro-choice rally, \"This is probably one of the worst times that we've seen because the numbers of people who are elected to Congress. I went through this as co-chair of the Arts Caucus. In '94, people were elected simply to come here to kill the National Endowment for the Arts. Now they're here to kill women\".[36][37][38]/nAfter the shooting of Gabby Giffords, Slaughter suggested the Federal Communications Commission was \"not working anymore\" and called for better policing of incendiary language.[39]/nDuring the 112th Congress, the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, or STOCK Act, which Slaughter first authored and introduced into Congress in 2006[40] \u2013 was passed into law.[41] The law prohibits the use of non-public information for private profit, including insider trading by members of Congress and other government employees, and requires many financial transactions by members of Congress to be reported within 45 days.[42]/nSlaughter was one of the most liberal and progressive members of the New York congressional delegation from upstate New York, and in the 110th Congress, was the most progressive member of the entire House of Representatives according to the National Journal.[43]/nSlaughter was one of several Democratic members of Congress who posted at Daily Kos, a Democratic-oriented blog. She was a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.[44]  She was the oldest member of Congress at the time of her death.[10]/nSlaughter was a member of a variety of congressional caucuses.[1] She was a former Co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues.[50]/nWhile traveling for work, she met Robert \"Bob\" Slaughter in San Antonio, Texas, and married him in 1957. After marrying, the couple moved to Fairport, New York, a suburb of Rochester, where Bob had been offered a job. The couple had three daughters. Bob Slaughter died in May 2014, aged 82.[51][52]/nTo the day she died, Slaughter still spoke with a marked Kentucky accent, which took many by surprise when they learned she represented a Western New York district.[53]/nOn March 14, 2018, Slaughter was admitted to George Washington University Hospital after suffering a concussion in a fall at her home in Washington, D.C. Two days later, on March 16, Slaughter died at the age of 88.[54]/nSlaughter's funeral was held at the Eastman Theater in Downtown Rochester. The funeral was attended by more than 2,000 people and featured speakers such as House of Representatives Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Congressman John Lewis, former Senator and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, and members of Slaughter's family.[55] The event was also broadcast live on local television channels Spectrum News, WHAM-TV and WHEC-TV./nA day after Slaughter's death, Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, along with former New York Lieutenant Governor and former Rochester mayor Bob Duffy, asked Amtrak to rename its Rochester station, in Slaughter's honor. Slaughter had played a significant part in securing the funding for replacing Amtrak's 1970s-vintage station with a new multimodal station that opened in 2017.[56] Four days later, Amtrak announced that it would rename the station.[57] The station was re-named the Louise M.

Prolific in many genres, he wrote more than fifty novels and dozens of short stories. His non-fiction output included works of social commentary, politics, history, popular science, satire, biography, and autobiography. Wells' science fiction novels are so well regarded that he has been called the \"father of science fiction\".[1][2]/nIn addition to his fame as a writer, he was prominent in his lifetime as a forward-looking, even prophetic social critic who devoted his literary talents to the development of a progressive vision on a global scale. As a futurist, he wrote a number of utopian works[3] and foresaw the advent of aircraft, tanks, space travel, nuclear weapons, satellite television and something resembling the World Wide Web.[4][5] His science fiction imagined time travel, alien invasion, invisibility and biological engineering before these subjects were common in the genre.[4] Brian Aldiss referred to Wells as the \"Shakespeare of science fiction\", while Charles Fort called him a \"wild talent\".[6]:\u200a7\u200a[7] He also pioneered modern miniature wargaming,[8][9] such as with his set of rules called Little Wars in 1913./nWells rendered his works convincing by instilling commonplace detail alongside a single extraordinary assumption per work\u00a0\u2013 dubbed \"Wells's law\"\u00a0\u2013 leading Joseph Conrad to hail him in 1898 with \"O Realist of the Fantastic!\".[10] His most notable science fiction works include The Time Machine (1895), which was his first novel, The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), The Invisible Man (1897), The War of the Worlds (1898), the military science fiction The War in the Air (1907), and the dystopian When the Sleeper Wakes (1910). Novels of social realism such as Kipps (1905) and The History of Mr Polly (1910), which describe lower-middle-class English life, led to the suggestion that he was a worthy successor to Charles Dickens,[11]:\u200a99\u200a but Wells described a range of social strata and even attempted, in Tono-Bungay (1909), a diagnosis of English society as a whole. Wells was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times.[12]/nWells's earliest specialised training was in biology, and his thinking on ethical matters took place in a Darwinian context.[13] He was also an outspoken socialist from a young age, often (but not always, as at the beginning of the First World War) sympathising with pacifist views.[14][15] In his later years, he wrote less fiction and more works expounding his political and social views, sometimes giving his profession as that of journalist.[11]  Wells was a diabetic and co-founded the charity The Diabetic Association (Diabetes UK) in 1934.[16]/nHerbert George Wells was born at Atlas House, 162 High Street in Bromley, Kent,[17] on 21 September 1866.[18] Called \"Bertie\" by his family, he was the fourth and last child of Joseph Wells, a former domestic gardener, and at the time a shopkeeper and professional cricketer and Sarah Neal, a former domestic servant. An inheritance had allowed the family to acquire a shop in which they sold china and sporting goods, although it failed to prosper: the stock was old and worn out, and the location was poor. Joseph Wells managed to earn a meagre income, but little of it came from the shop and he received an unsteady amount of money from playing professional cricket for the Kent county team.[19]/nA defining incident of young Wells's life was an accident in 1874 that left him bedridden with a broken leg.[18] To pass the time he began to read books from the local library, brought to him by his father. He soon became devoted to the other worlds and lives to which books gave him access; they also stimulated his desire to write. Later that year he entered Thomas Morley's Commercial Academy, a private school founded in 1849, following the bankruptcy of Morley's earlier school. The teaching was erratic, the curriculum mostly focused, Wells later said, on producing copperplate handwriting and doing the sort of sums useful to tradesmen. Wells continued at Morley's Academy until 1880. In 1877, his father, Joseph Wells, fractured his thigh. The accident effectively put an end to Joseph's career as a cricketer, and his subsequent earnings as a shopkeeper were not enough to compensate for the loss of the primary source of family income.[20]/nNo longer able to support themselves financially, the family instead sought to place their sons as apprentices in various occupations.[22] From 1880 to 1883, Wells had an unhappy apprenticeship as a draper at Hide's Drapery Emporium in Southsea.[23] His experiences at Hide's, where he worked a thirteen-hour day and slept in a dormitory with other apprentices,[17] later inspired his novels The Wheels of Chance, The History of Mr Polly, and Kipps, which portray the life of a draper's apprentice as well as providing a critique of society's distribution of wealth.[24]:\u200a2/nWells's parents had a turbulent marriage, owing primarily to his mother's being a Protestant and his father's being a freethinker. When his mother returned to work as a lady's maid (at Uppark, a country house in Sussex), one of the conditions of work was that she would not be permitted to have living space for her husband and children. Thereafter, she and Joseph lived separate lives, though they never divorced and remained faithful to each other. As a consequence, Herbert's personal troubles increased as he subsequently failed as a draper and also, later, as a chemist's assistant. However, Uppark had a magnificent library in which he immersed himself, reading many classic works, including Plato's Republic, Thomas More's Utopia, and the works of Daniel Defoe.[25] When he became the first doyen of science fiction as a distinct genre of fiction, Wells referenced Mary Shelley's Frankenstein in relation to his works, writing, \"they belong to a class of writing which includes the story of Frankenstein.\"[26]/nIn October 1879, Wells's mother arranged through a distant relative, Arthur Williams, for him to join the National School at Wookey in Somerset as a pupil\u2013teacher, a senior pupil who acted as a teacher of younger children.[23] In December that year, however, Williams was dismissed for irregularities in his qualifications and Wells was returned to Uppark. After a short apprenticeship at a chemist in nearby Midhurst and an even shorter stay as a boarder at Midhurst Grammar School, he signed his apprenticeship papers at Hyde's. In 1883, Wells persuaded his parents to release him from the apprenticeship, taking an opportunity offered by Midhurst Grammar School again to become a pupil\u2013teacher; his proficiency in Latin and science during his earlier short stay had been remembered.[19][23]/nThe years he spent in Southsea had been the most miserable of his life to that point, but his good fortune in securing a position at Midhurst Grammar School meant that Wells could continue his self-education in earnest.[19] The following year, Wells won a scholarship to the Normal School of Science (later the Royal College of Science in South Kensington, which became part of Imperial College London) in London, studying biology under Thomas Henry Huxley.[24]:\u200a164\u200a As an alumnus, he later helped to set up the Royal College of Science Association, of which he became the first president in 1909. Wells studied in his new school until 1887, with a weekly allowance of 21 shillings (a guinea) thanks to his scholarship. This ought to have been a comfortable sum of money (at the time many working class families had \"round about a pound a week\" as their entire household income),[27] yet in his Experiment in Autobiography Wells speaks of constantly being hungry, and indeed photographs of him at the time show a youth who is very thin and malnourished.[28]/nHe soon entered the Debating Society of the school. These years mark the beginning of his interest in a possible reformation of society. At first approaching the subject through Plato's Republic, he soon turned to contemporary ideas of socialism as expressed by the recently formed Fabian Society and free lectures delivered at Kelmscott House, the home of William Morris. He was also among the founders of The Science School Journal, a school magazine that allowed him to express his views on literature and society, as well as trying his hand at fiction; a precursor to his novel The Time Machine was published in the journal under the title The Chronic Argonauts. The school year 1886\u201387 was the last year of his studies.[24]:\u200a164/nDuring 1888, Wells stayed in Stoke-on-Trent, living in Basford. The unique environment of The Potteries was certainly an inspiration. He wrote in a letter to a friend from the area that \"the district made an immense impression on me.\" The inspiration for some of his descriptions in The War of the Worlds is thought to have come from his short time spent here, seeing the iron foundry furnaces burn over the city, shooting huge red light into the skies. His stay in The Potteries also resulted in the macabre short story \"The Cone\" (1895, contemporaneous with his famous The Time Machine), set in the north of the city.[29]:\u200a90/nAfter teaching for some time, he was briefly on the staff of Holt Academy in Wales[30] \u2013 Wells found it necessary to supplement his knowledge relating to educational principles and methodology and entered the College of Preceptors (College of Teachers). He later received his Licentiate and Fellowship FCP diplomas from the college. It was not until 1890 that Wells earned a Bachelor of Science degree in zoology from the University of London External Programme. In 1889\u201390, he managed to find a post as a teacher at Henley House School in London, where he taught A. A. Milne (whose father ran the school).[31][32] His first published work was a Text-Book of Biology in two volumes (1893).[33]/nUpon leaving the Normal School of Science, Wells was left without a source of income. His aunt Mary\u2014his father's sister-in-law\u2014invited him to stay with her for a while, which solved his immediate problem of accommodation. During his stay at his aunt's residence, he grew increasingly interested in her daughter, Isabel, whom he later courted. To earn money, he began writing short humorous articles for journals such as The Pall Mall Gazette, later collecting these in Select Conversations with an Uncle (1895) and Certain Personal Matters (1897). So prolific did Wells become at this mode of journalism that many of his early pieces remain unidentified. According to David C. Smith, \"Most of Wells's occasional pieces have not been collected, and many have not even been identified as his. Wells did not automatically receive the byline his reputation demanded until after 1896 or so\u00a0.... As a result, many of his early pieces are unknown. It is obvious that many early Wells items have been lost.\"[34] His success with these shorter pieces encouraged him to write book-length work, and he published his first novel, The Time Machine, in 1895.[35]/nIn 1891, Wells married his cousin Isabel Mary Wells (1865\u20131931; from 1902 Isabel Mary Smith).[37] The couple agreed to separate in 1894, when he had fallen in love with one of his students, Amy Catherine Robbins (1872\u20131927; later known as Jane), with whom he moved to Woking, Surrey, in May 1895. They lived in a rented house, 'Lynton' (now No.141), Maybury Road, in the town centre for just under 18 months and married at St Pancras register office in October 1895.[38][24]:\u200a165\u200a His short period in Woking was perhaps the most creative and productive of his whole writing career, for while there he planned and wrote The War of the Worlds and The Time Machine, completed The Island of Doctor Moreau, wrote and published The Wonderful Visit and The Wheels of Chance, and began writing two other early books, When the Sleeper Wakes and Love and Mr Lewisham.[38][39]/nIn late summer 1896, Wells and Jane moved to a larger house in Worcester Park, near Kingston upon Thames, for two years; this lasted until his poor health took them to Sandgate, near Folkestone, where he constructed a large family home, Spade House, in 1901. He had two sons with Jane: George Philip (known as \"Gip\"; 1901\u20131985) and Frank Richard (1903\u20131982)[6]:\u200a295\u200a (grandfather of film director Simon Wells). Jane died on 6 October 1927, in Dunmow, at the age of 55, which left Wells devastated. She was cremated at Golders Green, with friends of the couple present including George Bernard Shaw.[29]:\u200a64/nWells had multiple love affairs.[40] Dorothy Richardson was a friend with whom he had a brief affair which led to a pregnancy and miscarriage, in 1907. Wells' wife had been a schoolmate of Richardson.[41] In December 1909, he had a daughter, Anna-Jane, with the writer Amber Reeves,[42] whose parents, William and Maud Pember Reeves, he had met through the Fabian Society. Amber had married the barrister G. R. Blanco White in July of that year, as co-arranged by Wells. After Beatrice Webb voiced disapproval of Wells's \"sordid intrigue\" with Amber, he responded by lampooning Beatrice Webb and her husband Sidney Webb in his 1911 novel The New Machiavelli as 'Altiora and Oscar Bailey', a pair of short-sighted, bourgeois manipulators. Between 1910 and 1913, novelist Elizabeth von Arnim was one of his mistresses.[43] In 1914, he had a son, Anthony West (1914\u20131987), by the novelist and feminist Rebecca West, 26 years his junior.[44] In 1920\u201321, and intermittently until his death, he had a love affair with  the American birth control activist Margaret Sanger.[45]/nBetween 1924 and 1933 he partnered with the 22-year-younger Dutch adventurer and writer Odette Keun, with whom he lived in Lou Pidou, a house they built together in Grasse, France. Wells dedicated his longest book to her (The World of William Clissold, 1926).[46] When visiting Maxim Gorky in Russia 1920, he had slept with Gorky's mistress Moura Budberg,[47] then still Countess Benckendorf and 27 years his junior. In 1933, when she left Gorky and emigrated to London, their relationship renewed and she cared for him through his final illness. Wells repeatedly asked her to marry him, but Budberg strongly rejected his proposals.[48][49]/nIn Experiment in Autobiography (1934), Wells wrote: \"I was never a great amorist, though I have loved several people very deeply\".[50] David Lodge's novel A Man of Parts (2011)\u00a0\u2013 a 'narrative based on factual sources' (author's note)\u00a0\u2013 gives a convincing and generally sympathetic account of Wells's relations with the women mentioned above, and others.[51]/nDirector Simon Wells (born 1961), the author's great-grandson, was a consultant on the future scenes in Back to the Future Part II (1989).[52]/nOne of the ways that Wells expressed himself was through his drawings and sketches. One common location for these was the endpapers and title pages of his own diaries, and they covered a wide variety of topics, from political commentary to his feelings toward his literary contemporaries and his current romantic interests. During his marriage to Amy Catherine, whom he nicknamed Jane, he drew a considerable number of pictures, many of them being overt comments on their marriage. During this period, he called these pictures \"picshuas\".[53] These picshuas have been the topic of study by Wells scholars for many years, and in 2006, a book was published on the subject.[54]/nSome of his early novels, called \"scientific romances\", invented several themes now classic in science fiction in such works as The Time Machine, The Island of Doctor Moreau, The Invisible Man, The War of the Worlds, When the Sleeper Wakes, and The First Men in the Moon. He also wrote realistic novels that received critical acclaim, including Kipps and a critique of English culture during the Edwardian period, Tono-Bungay. Wells also wrote dozens of short stories and novellas, including, \"The Flowering of the Strange Orchid\", which helped bring the full impact of Darwin's revolutionary botanical ideas to a wider public, and was followed by many later successes such as \"The Country of the Blind\" (1904).[55]/nAccording to James E. Gunn, one of Wells's major contributions to the science fiction genre was his approach, which he referred to as his \"new system of ideas\".[56] In his opinion, the author should always strive to make the story as credible as possible, even if both the writer and the reader knew certain elements are impossible, allowing the reader to accept the ideas as something that could really happen, today referred to as \"the plausible impossible\" and \"suspension of disbelief\". While neither invisibility nor time travel was new in speculative fiction, Wells added a sense of realism to the concepts which the readers were not familiar with. He conceived the idea of using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time.[57] The term \"time machine\", coined by Wells, is almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle.[25] He explained that while writing The Time Machine, he realized that \"the more impossible the story I had to tell, the more ordinary must be the setting, and the circumstances in which I now set the Time Traveller were all that I could imagine of solid upper-class comforts.\"[58] In \"Wells's Law\", a science fiction story should contain only a single extraordinary assumption. Therefore, as justifications for the impossible, he employed scientific ideas and theories. Wells's best-known statement of the \"law\" appears in his introduction to a collection of his works published in 1934:/nAs soon as the magic trick has been done the whole business of the fantasy writer is to keep everything else human and real. Touches of prosaic detail are imperative and a rigorous adherence to the hypothesis. Any extra fantasy outside the cardinal assumption immediately gives a touch of irresponsible silliness to the invention.[59][60]/nDr. Griffin / The Invisible Man is a brilliant research scientist who discovers a method of invisibility, but finds himself unable to reverse the process. An enthusiast of random and irresponsible violence, Griffin has become an iconic character in horror fiction.[61] The Island of Doctor Moreau sees a shipwrecked man left on the island home of Doctor Moreau, a mad scientist who creates human-like hybrid beings from animals via vivisection.[62] The earliest depiction of uplift, the novel deals with a number of philosophical themes, including pain and cruelty, moral responsibility, human identity, and human interference with nature.[63] In The First Men in the Moon Wells used the idea of radio communication between astronomical objects, a plot point inspired by Nikola Tesla's claim that he had received radio signals from Mars.[64] In addition to science fiction, Wells produced work dealing with mythological beings like an angel in The Wonderful Visit (1895) and a mermaid in The Sea Lady (1902).[65]/nThough Tono-Bungay is not a science-fiction novel, radioactive decay plays a small but consequential role in it. Radioactive decay plays a much larger role in The World Set Free (1914), a book dedicated to Frederick Soddy who would receive a Nobel for proving the existence of radioactive isotopes.[66] This book contains what is surely Wells's biggest prophetic \"hit\", with the first description of a nuclear weapon (which he termed \"atomic bombs\").[66][67] Scientists of the day were well aware that the natural decay of radium releases energy at a slow rate over thousands of years. The rate of release is too slow to have practical utility, but the total amount released is huge. Wells's novel revolves around an (unspecified) invention that accelerates the process of radioactive decay, producing bombs that explode with no more than the force of ordinary high explosives\u2014but which \"continue to explode\" for days on end. \"Nothing could have been more obvious to the people of the earlier twentieth century, than the rapidity with which war was becoming impossible\u00a0... [but] they did not see it until the atomic bombs burst in their fumbling hands\".[67] In 1932, the physicist and conceiver of nuclear chain reaction Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd read The World Set Free (the same year Sir James Chadwick discovered the neutron), a book which he wrote in his memoirs had made \"a very great impression on me.\"[68] In 1934, Szil\u00e1rd took his ideas for a chain reaction to the British War Office and later the Admiralty, assigning his patent to the Admiralty to keep the news from reaching the notice of the wider scientific community. He wrote, \"Knowing what this [a chain reaction] would mean\u2014and I knew it because I had read H.\u00a0G. Wells\u2014I did not want this patent to become public.\"[66]/nWells also wrote non-fiction. His first non-fiction bestseller was Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress upon Human Life and Thought (1901). When originally serialised in a magazine it was subtitled \"An Experiment in Prophecy\", and is considered his most explicitly futuristic work. It offered the immediate political message of the privileged sections of society continuing to bar capable men from other classes from advancement until war would force a need to employ those most able, rather than the traditional upper classes, as leaders. Anticipating what the world would be like in the year 2000, the book is interesting both for its hits (trains and cars resulting in the dispersion of populations from cities to suburbs; moral restrictions declining as men and women seek greater sexual freedom; the defeat of German militarism, and the existence of a European Union) and its misses (he did not expect successful aircraft before 1950, and averred that \"my imagination refuses to see any sort of submarine doing anything but suffocate its crew and founder at sea\").[69][70]/nHis bestselling two-volume work, The Outline of History (1920), began a new era of popularised world history. It received a mixed critical response from professional historians.[71] However, it was very popular amongst the general population and made Wells a rich man. Many other authors followed with \"Outlines\" of their own in other subjects. He reprised his Outline in 1922 with a much shorter popular work, A Short History of the World, a history book praised by Albert Einstein,[72] and two long efforts, The Science of Life (1930)\u2014written with his son G. P. Wells and evolutionary biologist  Julian Huxley, and The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind (1931).[73][74] The \"Outlines\" became sufficiently common for James Thurber to parody the trend in his humorous essay, \"An Outline of Scientists\"\u2014indeed, Wells's Outline of History remains in print with a new 2005 edition, while A Short History of the World has been re-edited (2006).[75]/nFrom quite early in Wells's career, he sought a better way to organise society and wrote a number of Utopian novels.[3] The first of these was A Modern Utopia (1905), which shows a worldwide utopia with \"no imports but meteorites, and no exports at all\";[76] two travellers from our world fall into its alternate history. The others usually begin with the world rushing to catastrophe, until people realise a better way of living: whether by mysterious gases from a comet causing people to behave rationally and abandoning a European war (In the Days of the Comet (1906)), or a world council of scientists taking over, as in The Shape of Things to Come (1933, which he later adapted for the 1936 Alexander Korda film, Things to Come). This depicted, all too accurately, the impending World War, with cities being destroyed by aerial bombs. He also portrayed the rise of fascist dictators in The Autocracy of Mr Parham (1930) and The Holy Terror (1939). Men Like Gods (1923) is also a utopian novel. Wells in this period was regarded as an enormously influential figure; the literary critic Malcolm Cowley stated: \"by the time he was forty, his influence was wider than any other living English writer\".[77]/nWells contemplates the ideas of nature and nurture and questions humanity in books such as The First Men in the Moon, where nature is completely suppressed by nurture, and The Island of Doctor Moreau, where the strong presence of nature represents a threat to a civilized society. Not all his scientific romances ended in a Utopia, and Wells also wrote a dystopian novel, When the Sleeper Wakes (1899, rewritten as The Sleeper Awakes, 1910), which pictures a future society where the classes have become more and more separated, leading to a revolt of the masses against the rulers.[78] The Island of Doctor Moreau is even darker. The narrator, having been trapped on an island of animals vivisected (unsuccessfully) into human beings, eventually returns to England; like Gulliver on his return from the Houyhnhnms, he finds himself unable to shake off the perceptions of his fellow humans as barely civilised beasts, slowly reverting to their animal natures.[79]/nWells also wrote the preface for the first edition of W. N. P. Barbellion's diaries, The Journal of a Disappointed Man, published in 1919. Since \"Barbellion\" was the real author's pen name, many reviewers believed Wells to have been the true author of the Journal; Wells always denied this, despite being full of praise for the diaries.[80]/nIn 1927, a Canadian teacher and writer Florence Deeks unsuccessfully sued Wells for infringement of copyright and breach of trust, claiming that much of The Outline of History had been plagiarised from her unpublished manuscript,[81] The Web of the World's Romance, which had spent nearly nine months in the hands of Wells's Canadian publisher, Macmillan Canada.[82] However, it was sworn on oath at the trial that the manuscript remained in Toronto in the safekeeping of Macmillan, and that Wells did not even know it existed, let alone seen it.[83] The court found no proof of copying, and decided the similarities were due to the fact that the books had similar nature and both writers had access to the same sources.[84] In 2000, A. B. McKillop, a professor of history at Carleton University, produced a book on the case, The Spinster & The Prophet: Florence Deeks, H.\u00a0G. Wells, and the Mystery of the Purloined Past.[85] According to McKillop, the lawsuit was unsuccessful due to the prejudice against a woman suing a well-known and famous male author, and he paints a detailed story based on the circumstantial evidence of the case.[86] In 2004, Denis N. Magnusson, Professor Emeritus of the Faculty of Law, Queen's University, Ontario, published an article on Deeks v. Wells. This re-examines the case in relation to McKillop's book. While having some sympathy for Deeks, he argues that she had a weak case that was not well presented, and though she may have met with sexism from her lawyers, she received a fair trial, adding that the law applied is essentially the same law that would be applied to a similar case today (i.e., 2004).[87]/nIn 1933, Wells predicted in The Shape of Things to Come that the world war he feared would begin in January 1940,[88] a prediction which ultimately came true four months early, in September 1939, with the outbreak of World War II.[6]:\u200a209\u200a In 1936, before the Royal Institution, Wells called for the compilation of a constantly growing and changing World Encyclopaedia, to be reviewed by outstanding authorities and made accessible to every human being. He also presented on his conception of a world encyclopedia at the World Congress of Universal Documentation in Paris in 1937.[89]/nIn 1938, he published a collection of essays on the future organisation of knowledge and education, World Brain, including the essay \"The Idea of a Permanent World Encyclopaedia\".[90]/nPrior to 1933, Wells's books were widely read in Germany and Austria, and most of his science fiction works had been translated shortly after publication.[91] By 1933, he had attracted the attention of German officials because of his criticism of the political situation in Germany, and on 10 May 1933, Wells's books were burned by the Nazi youth in Berlin's Opernplatz, and his works were banned from libraries and book stores.[91] Wells, as president of PEN International (Poets, Essayists, Novelists), angered the Nazis by overseeing the expulsion of the German PEN club from the international body in 1934 following the German PEN's refusal to admit non-Aryan writers to its membership. At a PEN conference in Ragusa, Wells refused to yield to Nazi sympathisers who demanded that the exiled author Ernst Toller be prevented from speaking.[91] Near the end of World War II, Allied forces discovered that the SS had compiled lists of people slated for immediate arrest during the invasion of Britain in the abandoned Operation Sea Lion, with Wells included in the alphabetical list of \"The Black Book\".[92]/nSeeking a more structured way to play war games, Wells wrote Floor Games (1911) followed by Little Wars (1913), which set out rules for fighting battles with toy soldiers (miniatures).[93]  A pacifist prior to the First World War, Wells stated \"how much better is this amiable miniature [war] than the real thing\".[93] According to Wells, the idea of the game developed from a visit by his friend Jerome K. Jerome.  After dinner, Jerome began shooting down toy soldiers with a toy cannon and Wells joined in to compete.[93]/nDuring August 1914, immediately after the outbreak of the First World War, Wells published a number of articles in London newspapers that subsequently appeared as a book entitled The War That Will End War.[6]:\u200a147\u200a[94] He coined the expression with the idealistic belief that the result of the war would make a future conflict impossible.[95] Wells blamed the Central Powers for the coming of the war and argued that only the defeat of German militarism could bring about an end to war.[96] Wells used the shorter form of the phrase, \"the war to end war\", in In the Fourth Year (1918), in which he noted that the phrase \"got into circulation\" in the second half of 1914.[97] In fact, it had become one of the most common catchphrases of the war.[96]/nIn 1918 Wells worked for the British War Propaganda Bureau, also called Wellington House.[98] Wells was also one of fifty-three leading British authors \u2014 a number that included Rudyard Kipling, Thomas Hardy and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle \u2014 who signed their names to the \"Authors' Declaration.\" This manifesto declared that the German invasion of Belgium had been a brutal crime, and that Britain \"could not without dishonour have refused to take part in the present war.\"[98]/nWells visited Russia three times: 1914, 1920 and 1934. After his visit to Petrograd and Moscow, in January 1914, he returned \"a staunch Russophile\". He revealed his impressions in \"Russia and England: A Study on Contrasts\" in The Daily News, on 1 February 1941 and in the novel Joan and Peter (1918).[99]  During his second visit, he saw his old friend Maxim Gorky and with Gorky's help, met Vladimir Lenin. In his book Russia in the Shadows, Wells portrayed Russia as recovering from a total social collapse, \"the completest that has ever happened to any modern social organisation.\"[100] On 23 July 1934, after visiting U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Wells went to the Soviet Union and interviewed Joseph Stalin for three hours for the New Statesman magazine, which was extremely rare at that time. He told Stalin how he had seen 'the happy faces of healthy people' in contrast with his previous visit to Moscow in 1920.[101] However, he also criticised the lawlessness, class discrimination, state violence, and absence of free expression. Stalin enjoyed the conversation and replied accordingly. As the chairman of the London-based PEN International, which protected the rights of authors to write without being intimidated, Wells hoped by his trip to USSR, he could win Stalin over by force of argument. Before he left, he realised that no reform was to happen in the near future.[102][103]/nWells's greatest literary output occurred before the First World War, which was lamented by younger authors whom he had influenced. In this connection, George Orwell described Wells as \"too sane to understand the modern world\", and \"since 1920 he has squandered his talents in slaying paper dragons.\"[104] G. K. Chesterton quipped: \"Mr Wells is a born storyteller who has sold his birthright for a pot of message\".[105]/nWells had diabetes,[106] and was a co-founder in 1934 of The Diabetic Association (now Diabetes UK, the leading charity for people with diabetes in the UK).[107]/nOn 28 October 1940, on the radio station KTSA in San Antonio, Texas, Wells took part in a radio interview with Orson Welles, who two years previously had performed a famous radio adaptation of The War of the Worlds. During the interview, by Charles C Shaw, a KTSA radio host, Wells admitted his surprise at the sensation that resulted from the broadcast but acknowledged his debt to Welles for increasing sales of one of his \"more obscure\" titles.[108]/nWells died on 13 August 1946, aged 79, at his home at 13 Hanover Terrace, overlooking Regent's Park, London.[109][18] In his preface to the 1941 edition of The War in the Air, Wells had stated that his epitaph should be: \"I told you so. You damned fools\".[110] Wells's body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 16 August 1946; his ashes were subsequently scattered into the English Channel at Old Harry Rocks, the most eastern point of the Jurassic Coast and about 3.5 miles (5.6\u00a0km) from Swanage in Dorset.[111]/nA commemorative blue plaque in his honour was installed by the Greater London Council at his home in Regent's Park in 1966.[112]/nA futurist and \"visionary\", Wells foresaw the advent of aircraft, tanks, space travel, nuclear weapons, satellite television, and something resembling the World Wide Web.[5] Asserting that \"Wells's visions of the future remain unsurpassed\", John Higgs, author of Stranger Than We Can Imagine: Making Sense of the Twentieth Century, states that in the late 19th century Wells \"saw the coming century clearer than anyone else. He anticipated wars in the air, the sexual revolution, motorised transport causing the growth of suburbs and a proto-Wikipedia he called the \"world brain\". In his novel The World Set Free, he imagined an \"atomic bomb\" of terrifying power that would be dropped from aeroplanes. This was an extraordinary insight for an author writing in 1913, and it made a deep impression on Winston Churchill.\"[113]/nMany readers have hailed H.\u00a0G. Wells and George Orwell as special kinds of writers, ones endowed with remarkable prescriptive and prophetic powers. Wells was the twentieth-century prototype of this literary vatic figure: he invented the role, explored its possibilities, especially through new forms of prose and new ways to publish, and defined its boundaries. His impact on his culture was profound; as George Orwell wrote, \"The minds of all of us, and therefore the physical world, would be perceptibly different if Wells had never existed.\"/nIn 2011, Wells was among a group of science fiction writers featured in the Prophets of Science Fiction series, a show produced and hosted by film director Sir Ridley Scott, which depicts how predictions influenced the development of scientific advancements by inspiring many readers to assist in transforming those futuristic visions into everyday reality.[115] In a 2013 review of The Time Machine for the New Yorker magazine, Brad Leithauser writes, \"At the base of Wells's great visionary exploit is this rational, ultimately scientific attempt to tease out the potential future consequences of present conditions\u2014not as they might arise in a few years, or even decades, but millennia hence, epochs hence. He is world literature's Great Extrapolator. Like no other fiction writer before him, he embraced \"deep time\".[116]/nWells was a socialist and a member of the Fabian Society.[119] He stood as a Labour Party candidate for London University in the 1922 and 1923 general elections.[120]/nWinston Churchill was an avid reader of Wells's books, and after they first met in 1902 they kept in touch until Wells died in 1946.[117] As a junior minister Churchill borrowed lines from Wells for one of his most famous early landmark speeches in 1906, and as Prime Minister the phrase \"the gathering storm\"\u2014used by Churchill to describe the rise of Nazi Germany\u2014had been written by Wells in The War of the Worlds, which depicts an attack on Britain by Martians.[117] Wells's extensive writings on equality and human rights, most notably his most influential work, The Rights of Man (1940), laid the groundwork for the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations shortly after his death.[121]/nHis efforts regarding the League of Nations, on which he collaborated on the project with Leonard Woolf with the booklets The Idea of a League of Nations, Prolegomena to the Study of World Organization, and The Way of the League of Nations,  became a disappointment as the organization turned out to be a weak one unable to prevent the Second World War, which itself occurred towards the very end of his life and only increased the pessimistic side of his nature.[122] In his last book Mind at the End of Its Tether (1945), he considered the idea that humanity being replaced by another species might not be a bad idea. He referred to the era between the two World Wars as \"The Age of Frustration\".[123]/nWells was initially an opponent of Zionism, but later following the Holocaust became a strong supporter of the State of Israel.[124]/nHe was a member of The Other Club, a London dining club./nWells' views on God and religion changed over his lifetime. Early in his life he distanced himself from Christianity, and later from theism, and finally, late in life, he was essentially atheistic. Martin Gardner summarises this progression:/n[The younger Wells]\u00a0... did not object to using the word \"God\" provided it did not imply anything resembling human personality. In his middle years Wells went through a phase of defending the concept of a \"finite God,\" similar to the god of such process theologians as Samuel Alexander, Edgar Brightman, and Charles Hartshorne. (He even wrote a book about it called God the Invisible King.) Later Wells decided he was really an atheist.[125]/nIn God the Invisible King (1917), Wells wrote that his idea of God did not draw upon the traditional religions of the world:/nThis book sets out as forcibly and exactly as possible the religious belief of the writer. [Which] is a profound belief in a personal and intimate God.\u00a0... Putting the leading idea of this book very roughly, these two antagonistic typical conceptions of God may be best contrasted by speaking of one of them as God-as-Nature or the Creator, and of the other as God-as-Christ or the Redeemer. One is the great Outward God; the other is the Inmost God. The first idea was perhaps developed most highly and completely in the God of Spinoza. It is a conception of God tending to pantheism, to an idea of a comprehensive God as ruling with justice rather than affection, to a conception of aloofness and awestriking worshipfulness. The second idea, which is contradictory to this idea of an absolute God, is the God of the human heart. The writer suggested that the great outline of the theological struggles of that phase of civilisation and world unity which produced Christianity, was a persistent but unsuccessful attempt to get these two different ideas of God into one focus.[126]/nLater in the work, he aligns himself with a \"renascent or modern religion\u00a0... neither atheist nor Buddhist nor Mohammedan nor Christian\u00a0... [that] he has found growing up in himself\".[127]/nOf Christianity, he said: \"it is not now true for me.\u00a0... Every believing Christian is, I am sure, my spiritual brother\u00a0... but if systemically I called myself a Christian I feel that to most men I should imply too much and so tell a lie\". Of other world religions, he writes: \"All these religions are true for me as Canterbury Cathedral is a true thing and as a Swiss chalet is a true thing. There they are, and they have served a purpose, they have worked. Only they are not true for me to live in them.\u00a0... They do not work for me\".[128] In The Fate of Homo Sapiens (1939), Wells criticised almost all world religions and philosophies, stating \"there is no creed, no way of living left in the world at all, that really meets the needs of the time\u00a0.... When we come to look at them coolly and dispassionately, all the main religions, patriotic, moral and customary systems in which human beings are sheltering today, appear to be in a state of jostling and mutually destructive movement, like the houses and palaces and other buildings of some vast, sprawling city overtaken by a landslide.\"[129]/nWells's opposition to organised religion reached a fever pitch in 1943 with publication of his book Crux Ansata, subtitled \"An Indictment of the Roman Catholic Church\".[130]/nThe science fiction historian John Clute describes Wells as \"the most important writer the genre has yet seen\", and notes his work has been central to both British and American science fiction.[131] Science fiction author and critic Algis Budrys said Wells \"remains the outstanding expositor of both the hope, and the despair, which are embodied in the technology and which are the major facts of life in our world\".[132] He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1921, 1932, 1935, and 1946.[12] Wells so influenced real exploration of space that impact craters on Mars and the Moon were named after him:[133]/nWells's genius was his ability to create a stream of brand new, wholly original stories out of thin air. Originality was Wells's calling card. In a six-year stretch from 1895 to 1901, he produced a stream of what he called \"scientific romance\" novels, which included The Time Machine, The Island of Doctor Moreau, The Invisible Man, The War of the Worlds and The First Men in the Moon. This was a dazzling display of new thought, endlessly copied since. A book like The War of the Worlds inspired every one of the thousands of alien invasion stories that followed. It burned its way into the psyche of mankind and changed us all forever./nIn the United Kingdom, Wells's work was a key model for the British \"scientific romance\", and other writers in that mode, such as Olaf Stapledon,[134] J. D. Beresford,[135] S. Fowler Wright,[136] and Naomi Mitchison,[137] all drew on Wells's example. Wells was also an important influence on British science fiction of the period after the Second World War, with Arthur C. Clarke[138] and Brian Aldiss[139] expressing strong admiration for Wells's work. A self-declared fan of Wells, John Wyndham, author of The Day of the Triffids and The Midwich Cuckoos, echoes Wells's obsession with catastrophe and its aftermath.[140] His early work (pre 1920) made Wells the literary hero of dystopian novelist George Orwell.[141] Among contemporary British science fiction writers, Stephen Baxter, Christopher Priest and Adam Roberts have all acknowledged Wells's influence on their writing; all three are vice-presidents of the H. G. Wells Society. He also had a strong influence on British scientist J. B. S. Haldane, who wrote Daedalus; or, Science and the Future (1924), \"The Last Judgement\" and \"On Being the Right Size\" from the essay collection Possible Worlds (1927), and Biological Possibilities for the Human Species in the Next Ten Thousand Years (1963), which are speculations about the future of human evolution and life on other planets. Haldane gave several lectures about these topics which in turn influenced other science fiction writers.[142][143]/nIn the United States, Hugo Gernsback reprinted most of Wells's work in the pulp magazine Amazing Stories, regarding Wells's work as \"texts of central importance to the self-conscious new genre\".[131] Later American writers such as Ray Bradbury,[144] Isaac Asimov,[145] Frank Herbert,[146] Carl Sagan,[133] and Ursula K. Le Guin[147] all recalled being influenced by Wells./nSinclair Lewis's early novels were strongly influenced by Wells's realistic social novels, such as The History of Mr Polly; Lewis also named his first son Wells after the author.[148] Lewis nominated H.\u00a0G. Wells for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1932.[12]/nIn an interview with The Paris Review, Vladimir Nabokov described Wells as his favourite writer when he was a boy and \"a great artist.\"[149] He went on to cite The Passionate Friends, Ann Veronica, The Time Machine, and The Country of the Blind as superior to anything else written by Wells's British contemporaries. Nabokov said: \"His sociological cogitations can be safely ignored, of course, but his romances and fantasies are superb.\"[149]/nJorge Luis Borges wrote many short pieces on Wells in which he demonstrates a deep familiarity with much of Wells's work.[150] While Borges wrote several critical reviews, including a mostly negative review of Wells's film Things to Come,[151] he regularly treated Wells as a canonical figure of fantastic literature. Late in his life, Borges included The Invisible Man and The Time Machine in his Prologue to a Personal Library,[152] a curated list of 100 great works of literature that he undertook at the behest of the Argentine publishing house Emec\u00e9. Canadian author Margaret Atwood read Wells's books,[79] and he also inspired writers of European speculative fiction such as Karel \u010capek[147] and Yevgeny Zamyatin.[147]/nIn 2021, Wells was one of six British writers commemorated on a series of UK postage stamps issued by Royal Mail to celebrate British science fiction.[153] Six classic science fiction novels were depicted, one from each author, with The Time Machine chosen to represent Wells.[153]/nThe novels and short stories of H.\u00a0G. Wells have been adapted for cinema. These include Island of Lost Souls (1932), The Invisible Man (1933), Things to Come (1936), The Man Who Could Work Miracles (1937), The War of the Worlds (1953), The Time Machine (1960), First Men in the Moon (1964), The Island of Dr. Moreau (1977), The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996), The Time Machine (2002) and War of the Worlds (2005).[174][175][176][177]/nIn 1954, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign purchased the H.\u00a0G. Wells literary papers and correspondence collection.[178] The university's Rare Book & Manuscript Library holds the largest collection of Wells manuscripts, correspondence, first editions and publications in the United States.[179] Among these is unpublished material and the manuscripts of such works as The War of the Worlds and The Time Machine. The collection includes first editions, revisions and translations. The letters contain general family correspondence, communications from publishers, material regarding the Fabian Society, and letters from politicians and public figures, most notably George Bernard Shaw and Joseph Conrad.[178]", "3060884": "Reiji Okazaki (\u5ca1\u5d0e \u4ee4\u6cbb, Okazaki Reiji, October 8, 1930 \u2013 August 1, 1975) was a pioneer Japanese molecular biologist, known for his research on DNA replication and especially for describing the role of Okazaki fragments along with his wife Tsuneko./nOkazaki was born in Hiroshima, Japan.

When samples were taken from the bottom of the test tube, it was found that half were heavy and half were light, proving that half of the DNA was complete and half was in fragments. Then he took a sample of E. coli DNA that had been synthesized for an additional five seconds, and found all the activity now resulted in the larger molecular weight.[4] This complete replacement of fragments was later identified as RNA primers being replaced with DNA nucleotides by DNA polymerase I and Okazaki fragments being joined by DNA ligase.[5]/n/nThis article about a Japanese scientist is a stub.

Together with Erwin B\u00fcnning and Colin Pittendrigh, he is considered to be a co-founder of the field of chronobiology.[1]/nAschoff's work in the field of chronobiology introduced ideas of light interactions in the circadian rhythms of nocturnal and diurnal species as summarized by Aschoff's Rules./nAschoff was born in Freiburg Im Breisgau, the fifth child of pathologist Ludwig Aschoff (known for discovering the Aschoff-Tawara or atrioventricular node) and his wife Clara. He grew up in the liberal but morally strict world of Prussian academia.[1] After the Abitur at a humanistic high school, he \u2013 according to his own statement \"lacking a specific interest\" \u2013 studied medicine at the University of Bonn, where he joined the Burschenschaft (fraternity) Alemannia Bonn. Aschoff's scientific career began in 1938, when he moved to the University of G\u00f6ttingen to study thermoregulation physiology with Hermann Rein. In 1944, he received the venia legendi. He then became a professor at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in 1949.[2]/nIn 1952, his mentor, Hermann Rein, was appointed director of the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg.[1] Rein brought Aschoff to the Institute as a collaborator to study circadian rhythms in humans, birds, and mice.[1] Aschoff then moved to the Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology in Andechs to work with Gustav Kramer, who showed time-compensated sun-compass navigation in birds, and Erich von Holst, who studied physiological oscillators.[2] From 1967 to 1979, he was a director at the Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology and an  professor in Munich. Aschoff was a scientific member and a member of the Kollegiums of the Max Planck Institute for Behavior Physiology, as well as senator of the Max Planck Society from 1972 to 1976./nAschoff was known as an excellent lecturer with a booming voice, and he took a special interest in creating a scientific community and encouraging young scientists.[2][3] After his retirement in 1983 and return to Freiburg, Aschoff continued his scientific work in the form of further publications. J\u00fcrgen Aschoff died in 1998 aged 85 after a short illness, only ten months after his beloved wife, Hilde, passed away.[2]/nAschoff provided a strong foundation for the field of chronobiology through his research on circadian rhythms and entrainment in many different organisms such as rats, mice, birds, macaques, monkeys, and humans. His early research focused on understanding the properties of circadian rhythms and how these rhythms can change in response to stimuli. His later work was more applicable to pathologies, such as psychiatric disorders and dangers of shift work schedules, which can result from manipulating specific Zeitgebers.[1]/nAschoff began his research on the physiology of thermoregulation by self-experimentation. He discovered that there was a 24-hour rhythm of variation in body temperature.[1] After these experiments, he began investigating the basic mechanisms of circadian rhythm. In the 1950s, he met and began to collaborate with Erwin B\u00fcnning and Colin Pittendrigh. Aschoff began further experimentation studying the circadian rhythms of birds and mice under constant conditions. His results led to the conclusion that the circadian oscillations of biological processes were innate and did not require prior exposure to a 24-hour day to be expressed.[1]/nAschoff also applied these methods to experiments with human circadian rhythms by building an underground \"bunker\" to isolate human subjects from any external environmental cues. Subjects placed in this bunker were allowed to turn lights on or off according to their own internal rhythms. After over twenty years of tracking sleep-wake cycles, body temperature, urine output, and other physiological and behavioral outputs, Aschoff and his collaborator R\u00fctger Wever concluded that humans have endogenous circadian oscillators.[1][4] This discovery has become the foundation for our understanding of many medical problems such as aging, sleep disorders, and jet lag.[1]/nColin Pittendrigh is commonly thought to be the first researcher to study chronobiology in modern times. He studied fruit flies in the 1950s, and his mentee, J\u00fcrgen Aschoff, studied humans in the 1960s.[5] In 1960, Aschoff coined the term Zeitgeber (from German for \"time giver\" or \"synchronizer\") to refer to external, environmental cues that synchronize an endogenous oscillator to the environmental cycle.[6] To investigate the properties of natural endogenous oscillators, Aschoff exposed organisms to constant conditions without Zeitgeber cues (either constant light or constant darkness). The observations from this paper were formulated into the fundamental rules of biological clocks./nAschoff's experiments executed in 1960 showed that under constant light conditions, the activity phase shortens in nocturnal organisms and lengthens in diurnal organisms. These trends were termed alpha compression and alpha expansion, respectively.[6] In tribute to his mentor, Pittendrigh called this observation \"Aschoff's Rule\" in a different 1960 publication, and the designation remains today.[7]/nAschoff's rule is related to the model of parametric entrainment, which assumes continuous phase changes. This means that activity patterns adjust to environmental light patterns.[8] Parametric and non-parametric concepts refer to the nature of the action of light, whether continuous or tonic in the case of parametric entrainment, or discrete or phasic in the case of nonparametric entrainment. Suggestive of phasic effects are the large phase shifts elicited often by very brief light pulses, while the changes in period as a result of different constant light intensities are proof of the existence of tonic effects.[9] Aschoff and Pittendrigh approached the field with different models of how oscillators entrain, which resulted in different predictive models.[10] Aschoff's parametric model states that entrainment occurs through gradual changes in the clock that adapt to a new light-dark cycle. Although this is no longer recognized as the only objectively correct model in the field, Serge Daan suggested in 1998 that Aschoff made qualitative contributions that provide valuable alternatives to inconsistencies in the current field.[10]/nRelevant terms to understanding Aschoff's Rule are listed below:[11][12][13][14]/nAschoff's 4 Rules are generalities that most diurnal and nocturnal organisms follow.  The main basis for Aschoff's rule was the differential responses in free-running periods to DD and LL, later expanded to Tau=f(LL-intensity).[15] These rules provide an explanation of how the free running period (Tau \u2018\u03c4\u2019) of an organism deviates slightly from a 24-hour period.[16]/nRule 1: The free running period of a nocturnal organism is typically less than 24 hours.\ud835\udf0fDD < 24. [17]/nRule 2: The free running period of a diurnal organism is typically more than 24 hours.\ud835\udf0fLL > 24 [17]/nRule 3: Increasing the intensity of a light in LL will typically increase the length of a free running period in nocturnal organisms.[17]/nRule 4: Increasing the intensity of a light in LL will typically decrease the length of a free running period in diurnal organisms.[17]/nTo help with understanding, a nocturnal species such as house mice that are kept in a constantly dark environment would exhibit a free-running period shorter than 24 hours (Aschoff's first rule). In contrast, a diurnal species such as a starling that is kept in a constantly dark environment would exhibit a free-running period longer than 24 hours (Aschoff's second rule).[18]/nThere are a few exceptions to these rules.[15] For example, certain species of ground beetles and squirrels violate Aschoff's first rule by not producing the predicted changes in their free-running rhythms in response to constant light (LL). Some arthropods also appear to violate Aschoff's third rule however it is not certain because prior lighting history can cause long-lasting after-effects on the circadian period and alter the observed compliance with Aschoff's rules.[19]/nMuch of Aschoff's later work involved tests on human subjects. He found that the absence of a light-dark cycle does not prevent humans from entrainment. Rather, knowing the time of day from social cues, such as regular meal times, is sufficient for entrainment.[20] \nAschoff also found that different circadian outputs such as body temperature and locomotor activity can be either internally synchronized or desynchronized depending on the strength of the Zeitgeber. In constant darkness, rectal temperature and sleep onset and duration became desynchronized in some subjects, and the rectal temperature at the time of sleep onset was correlated to the duration of the bout of sleep. He hypothesized that internal desynchronization, the phase differences resulting from period differences between two circadian output processes, could be related to many psychiatric disorders.[21]/nSome of Aschoff's later work also integrated his initial interest in thermoregulation with his work on circadian rhythm. He found a circadian rhythm in thermal conductance, a measurement of heat transfer from the body.[22] Minimal conductance in mammals and birds oscillates with circadian phase, with a wide range of conductance values. This allows animals to release heat during their activity period, when they have higher basal metabolism, as well as conserve heat during their rest period, when they have lower basal metabolism.[22] In birds, the circadian rhythm in conductance results mostly from circadian rates of evaporative heat loss. In mammals, the conductance oscillates with circadian rhythms in the body's heat resistance and blood flow rate.[22]/nFollowing up on his temperature studies, he found that a mammalian species can entrain to a temperature cycle, but that temperature is a weak Zeitgeber compared to a light-dark cycle.[23]/nAschoff described masking signals as inputs that circumvent the pacemaker but nevertheless lead to modulation of a circadian behavior that is also controlled by the pacemaker.[24] Parametric entrainment is entrainment that does not result from an instant change in phase, as governed by a Phase Response Curve, as in the case of masking signals. The term Aschoff used for this phenomenon is \u201carousal\u201d due to non-photic zeitgebers. Data from experimental assays show a relationship between masking effects and phase, leading to a \u201cdemasking\u201d effect whereby animals arrhythmic in constant conditions have free-running periods in high frequency light-dark cycles. Aschoff concluded that the oscillator or circadian clock \u201cintegrates\u201d over the intensity of light to which it has been exposed, and then responds with a change in the period of activity, as seen in greenfinches, chaffinches, hamsters, and siskins. Aschoff concluded, however, that non-parametric effects, as opposed to parametric effects, are the principal source of entrainment.[25]/nJurgen Aschoff and R\u00fctger Wever created an experiment in which participants lived in a bunker for multiple weeks in a row, with limited to no access to the outside world, to measure effects on bodily functioning, sleep-wake activity, and time perception. Participants were asked to press a buzzer every hour and one minute after the hour. The scientists found that urine and rectal samples and circadian rhythms had a free-running period of 25 hours./nThe impact of light intensity on the circadian period was measured by changing light lux from 40 to 200. Increasing the light intensity can cause a decrease in the period of .7-1hour./nDesynchronization of body temperature from circadian period was seen in some participants immediately upon entry to the bunker or after several weeks. Body temperature maintained approximately a 25-hour rhythm while sleep-wake cycles fluctuated significantly. This led to the hypothesis that humans may have multiple circadian clocks.[26]/nFree running periods in humans are thought to range from 23.56hrs-24.7hrs,[27] and it is suspected that the larger value found in this experiment is due to light exposure. The dual circadian pacemaker model has been updated to a system of a central and a peripheral clock.[28]/nAschoff published articles with both Pittendrigh and Serge Daan, the latter also a pivotal researcher in chronobiology.[10] In his late work, Daan  attempted to reconcile the idea of parametric entrainment to light proposed by Aschoff with the non-parametric model of entrainment proposed by Pittendrigh. Results from a 2008 paper from Daan's lab lend further evidence to Aschoff's model of parametric entrainment.[29] Daan passed away in 2018./nAschoff's work inspired research research related to blue light intensity, molecular basis of circadian rhythms, and modeling the SCN./nAt the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, China in the Wang[30] lab, research was conducted to determine the role of blue light on CRY2 and PRR9 interactions in plants to create a molecular basis for Aschoff's rule. CRY2 is stimulated by blue light to interact directly with PRR9. This prevents PRR9 from interacting with co-repressor TPL/TPRs and downstream kinase PPKs. The co-repressor and downstream kinases phosphorylate PRR9 to help regulate rhythms. In an experiment to determine the relationship between varying light intensity and PRR9 mutants, it was discovered that both PRR9-1 and PRR90x-1 had changes of photoperiods under high light irradiance. This variation is deemed to be related to CRY2 activity. It was also found that CRY2 blocks PRR9-TPL interactions by GFP tagging the photolyase homology region on CRY2. The PHR domain of CRY2 by itself can co-immunoprecipitate full-length PRR9, meaning CRY2 can be used to isolate the protein. Additionally CRY2 is found to inhibit PRR9 phosphorylation using lambda phosphatase treatments. The phosphorylation of PRR9 is critical for circadian rhythms. Blue light stimulates CRY2 activity, thereby altering the phosphorylation of PRR9 and timing of circadian rhythms./n\u200cIn the Foster[31] lab at Imperial College in London, United Kingdom, research was conducted to determine the molecular basis for Aschoff's rule. Wheel running behavior was collected from mice in DD or LL for 50 days and the abundance of four genes and proteins was collected every four hours using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Researchers found that in DD mPer1, mPer2, mCry1, and mCry2 messages demonstrated rhythmic behavior and their corresponding protein levels also demonstrated rhythmic behavior. In LL mPer1, mPer2, mCry1, and mCry2 demonstrated rhythmic behavior but mCry2 had significantly altered behavior compared to its DD rhythm. Additionally, mPER1, mCRY1, and mCRY2 all showed rhythmic behavior but mPER2 was constitutively expressed. Phase contrast microscopy was used to show that mPER2 was concentrated in the nucleus during LL, as it appears in DD during CT12. Under DD, mice had an average period of 23.26 \u00b1 0.05h. In LL, mice had an average period of 24.47 \u00b1 0.06hrs. The LL mice had a significantly longer period. This research supports the idea that mPER2 contributes to phase delays. Additionally, it suggests that light does not act on mPer2 transcription or mPER2 translation to the nucleus. Rather, light is inhibiting a different mechanism that would typically cause mPER2 degradation./nAt the University of Aveiro, Portugal in the Yoon[32] lab researchers determined that the core-shell organization of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (Kuramoto model) contributes to anticipation and dissociation with regard to activity. Previous research states that the SCN shell (ventral) is dense with arginine vasopressin neurons and the core possesses vasoactive intestinal polypeptide neurons. [4] It was determined that the SCN upholds Aschoff's first rule of a shorting free-running period in DD and a lengthening period in LL. The Kuramoto model accounts for free-running periods coming from individual cells while also considering population-based activity coming from neurons as they exhibit nearly identical patterns. In the entrained state, the core activity parallels the external stimulus. However, the shell peaks before the core. This allows the system to demonstrate\u00a0anticipation of external events by peaking at two separate times and queueing peripheral clocks of the incoming signal. The shell phase difference (\u03c8d-\u03c8v) is shown to be proportional to the gap between peak activity between the two./nAt a dinner held in Aschoff's honor at the 1991 Gordon Conference on Chronobiology, Professor Till Roenneberg began the tradition of giving the  \"Aschoff's Rule Prize\" to scientists who have advanced the field of chronobiology.

Alongside fellow DPP members Huang Hsin-chieh and Chen Yung-hsing, Lin walked out of the assembly on 4 May 1992, criticizing the body for procedural violations.[7] In September 1993, Lin accepted the DPP nomination as its candidate for the Taichung mayoralty.[8] Lin lost to Lin Po-jung\u00a0[zh], who secured a second consecutive term./nLin led Taipei's Bureau of Environmental Protection\u00a0[zh] while Chen Shui-bian was mayor.[2] Chen was elected president in 2000, and Lin was appointed minister of the Environmental Protection Administration by Premier Tang Fei in April, taking office with the rest of the cabinet on 20 May.[2] Shortly after joining the EPA, Lin renounced his opposition to nuclear energy, stating that he had held that stance largely to combat totalitarianism.[9] In October, Lin made his first trip to the United States in an official capacity and became the first EPA executive to include environmentalists as part of his contingent abroad.[4] The Amorgos oil spill occurred in January 2001, and the Executive Yuan was criticized for its delayed response.[10][11] Subsequently, Lin resigned his position in March.[12]/nIn August of that year, Lin was named ambassador to The Gambia.[13] He served until December 2004, when he was sworn in as Taiwan's representative to the United Kingdom.[14] His first trip in the UK took place the next month.[3] While in the UK, Lin has spoken out against the One China principle, Anti-Secession Law, and one country, two systems.[15][16] Instead, Lin proposed that the European Union pass its own version of the United States' Taiwan Relations Act.[17]", "9581771": "Sir William Abbott Herdman FRS FRSE FLS (5 September 1858, Edinburgh \u2013 21 July 1924) was a Scottish marine zoologist and oceanographer.[1][2]/nHis zoological author abbreviation is Herdman./nHe was born in Edinburgh the son of the artist Robert Herdman RSA and his wife, Emma Abbott.

Cater for the popular market and published posthumously./nFountaine was an accomplished natural history illustrator and had a great love and knowledge of butterflies, travelling and collecting extensively through Europe, South Africa, India, Tibet, America, Australia and the West Indies, publishing numerous papers on her work. She raised many of the butterflies from eggs or caterpillars, producing specimens of great quality, 22,000 of which are housed at the Norwich Castle Museum and known as the Fountaine-Neimy Collection. Her four sketch books of butterfly life-cycles are held at the Natural History Museum in London. The butterfly genus Fountainea was named in her honour./nFountaine was born in Norwich, the eldest of seven children of an English country clergyman, Reverend John Fountaine of South Acre parish in Norfolk. John Fountaine had married Mary Isabella Lee (died 4 July 1906) on 19 January 1860 \u2013 she was the daughter of Reverend Daniel Henry Lee-Warner of Walsingham Abbey in Norfolk.[3] Fountain was baptised on 30 September 1862.[2] After Fountaine's father's death in 1877, the family moved to Eaton Grange in Norwich.[2]  On 15 April 1878, Fountaine, who was educated at home, began keeping a diary and she did this until her death in 1940.[2]/nFountaine travelled the world, collecting butterflies in sixty countries on six continents over fifty years,[4] and became an expert in tropical butterfly life-cycles.[5] Fountaine undertook most of her work collecting butterflies alone. In the summers she would return to England to arrange her collection of butterflies.[6] Fountaine compiled reports and drawings of the butterflies she found and sent them to entomological journals.[7] However, many of her discoveries of tropical butterflies were not written up.[6]/nAt the age of 27, Fountaine and her sisters became financially independent, having inherited a considerable sum of money from their uncle. Fountaine and her sister travelled to France and Switzerland, relying on the Tourist Handbook by Thomas Cook & Son. In Switzerland Fountaine felt the desire to acquire specimens of the Scarce Swallowtail and Camberwell Beauty butterflies, when discovering them in the valleys. Her interest in serious entomology grew and she started to use the Linnean rather than the common names for butterflies in her diary. Back in England, in the winter of 1895, she visited the estate of Henry John Elwes.[8] Elwes was a seasoned scientific traveller and had served as vice-president of the Royal Horticultural Society and was fellow of the Royal Society. His butterfly specimen collection was the largest private collection in the country, and Fountaine felt her entomological efforts were childish in comparison.[9]/nInspired, she travelled to Sicily with declared entomological ambitions.[10] She was the first British butterfly collector to brave the south Italian Brigande. In Sicily she contacted the leading lepidopterist Enrico Ragusa[9] and her research in Sicily led to her first publication on the subject in The Entomologist's Record and Journal of Variation in 1897. In the article she shared original knowledge of the local habitats and the butterfly varieties of Sicily. Her article was discussed in subsequent issues of The Entomologist. In 1897 several of her specimens were admitted to the British Museum's collection, which only accepted specimens of extraordinary quality.[11]/nFollowing her expedition to Sicily Fountaine became a reputable collector and she formed professional relations with lepidopterists in the Natural History Department of the British Museum. In 1898 she travelled to Trieste, and met entomologists in Austria-Hungary and the German Empire. Her second article in The Entomologist was on species variation. In 1899 she went on an expedition to the French Alps, where she met up with Elwes, whose reference book on European butterflies she used. Fountaine started to collect caterpillars in the French Alps, which she breed to produce adult butterfly specimens. In subsequent articles in The Entomologist, she wrote on food plants, plant hosts and the environmental conditions that were needed to grow perfect butterfly specimens. Back in Britain she was praised by Elwes for the quality of her work and her collection. In her diary she wrote \"yet I know that if I did not turn my long days of toil to some scientific account when I got the chance, for what else have I toiled?\".[11]/nIn 1898 she was elected as a fellow to the Royal Entomological Society and participated in the meetings. In her diaries she noted \"I well know, of my being the sole representative of my sex present, with the exception of one lady visitor.\"[12] In the summer of 1900 she and Elwes collected butterflies in Greece and they published an account of their findings in The Entomologist. She cooperated with Elwes on his Grecian Lepidoptera exhibition.[13]/nThe money she had inherited from her uncle allowed her to travel extensively and expand her collection. It is however difficult to establish exact dates for her scientific expeditions, as she travelled mostly without a passport and did not record dates of arrival or departure in her diary. Between 1901 and her death in 1940 a number of important expeditions can nevertheless be established. In 1901 she went on an expedition to Greater Syria in the Ottoman Empire which led to a publication in The Entomologist. In the article she discussed the breeding of rare butterfly species. In Syria she hired the dragoman Khalil Neimy, who would become her travel companion. In 1903 she went on expedition to the Ottoman Empire and she returned to Istanbul with nearly 1,000 butterflies. Her articles in The Entomologist on the expedition discussed seasonal and geographical influences on butterfly species, prompting notes and letters on the subject in subsequent issues.[12]/nIn 1904 and 1905 she was on scientific expeditions in Cape Colony and Southern Rhodesia. There she wrote and illustrated sketch books to document eggs, caterpillars and chrysalises. Norman Riley, who went on to become the head of the Entomology Department at the British Museum, said \"these sketchbooks were most beautifully done and illustrated the metamorphosis of many species which had not been previously known to science\". Her research on the life cycles, food plants and seasonal timings of skin and colour changes was published in Transactions of the Entomological Society. This highly scientific article was reviewed and praised by entomologists. When she was back in London Fountaine set her African specimens. Subsequently, she went on expedition in the United States, Central America and the Caribbean. In Kingston, Jamaica she held a talk at the Kingston Naturalists' Club on \"The sagacity of caterpillars\".[12]/nThe scientific societies of Britain had historically excluded women. Like the Royal Entomological Society, the Botanical Society of London and Zoological Society only admitted women in the first half of the 19th century.[14] But when Fountaine attended the Second International Congress of Entomology held in Oxford in 1912, she was invited by Edward Poulton, president of the Linnean Society, to formally join the society. This marked the height of her entomological career. 15 years earlier Beatrix Potter had been unable to attend a reading of her own paper at the society, because she was a woman. The botanist Marian Farquharson had petitioned learned societies to admit women. Farquharson's petition prompted members of the Linnean Society to put the matter to a vote in 1903. Female fellows were allowed, and in 1904 a ballot was taken on 15 prospective women fellows.[15]/nIn the run-up to World War I Fountaine was on expedition in India, Ceylon, Nepal and the territories of the Qing Dynasty in what is considered Tibet. On the trip she produced watercolours of caterpillars and butterflies, which were published in The Entomologist.[16] During the war Fountaine travelled to the US, and in 1917 published articles on her collection while volunteering for the Red Cross. In 1918 she ran out of money because she could not get her money wired to the USA. Thus she accepted paid work on specimens from the Ward's Natural Science Establishment. After the war Fountaine's last entomological expedition was to Khalil in the Philippines. An account of the expedition was published in The Entomologist and would 50 years later serve as a reference for conservation work.[17]/nFountaine was in her mid-sixties, and while she continued to travel for expeditions, she focused her efforts on watercolours and collecting. She only published the occasional note on the expeditions in The Entomologist. She travelled to various places in West and East Africa, Indo-China, Hong Kong, the Malay States, Brazil, the West Indies and Trinidad. Her letters to Riley reveal that she was on the hunt for rare specimens. Aged 77 she suffered a heart attack in Trinidad. Reportedly she was found dead on a path on Mount St. Benedict, with a butterfly net in her hand.[17] The Benedictine monk who discovered her, Brother Bruno, brought her body back to Pax Guest House, where she was staying at the time. She was buried in an unmarked grave at Woodbrook Cemetery, Port of Spain, Trinidad./nIt was after her death that she acquired general fame, when her collection and diaries were unsealed. After her death her literary and artistic talent for drawing butterflies became known more widely.[6] She left a large collection of scientifically accurate watercolours to the British Museum of Natural History.[14]/nFountaine's extensive butterfly collection was only opened 38 years after her death. In accordance with her will it had been deposited at Norwich Castle Museum in the year of her death. She had also provided that the collection was only to be opened in 1978. A box and ten display cases with more than 22,000 specimens had been deposited.[18]/nIn the box that was unsealed alongside her butterfly collection were Fountaine's diaries. She had filled twelve large volumes of cloth-bound books with some 3,203 pages and more than a million words, displaying a blend of Victorian reserve and startling candour.[19] The diaries were edited by the assistant editor of the Sunday Times W. F. Cater into two books, published under the titles Love among the Butterflies and Butterflies and Late Loves.[6]/nCater had produced an abridged 340 page version of her diaries, for the popular market. Fountaine's scientific work and career was reduced to her activities as a collector of butterflies. Cater compiled a selection of passages on romance and travel, while the work of collecting, breeding and mounting specimens got short shrift. The former senior curator of Natural History at the Norwich Castle Museum, Dr Tony Irwin had announced the existence of the diaries, and started to promote Fountaine's romantic life above her entomological contribution. He was of the opinion that her butterfly collection was \"not outstanding\" and said of her that \"she was a girl in love\" who \"sought refuge in the pursuit of butterflies\". A recent biography of Fountaine by Natascha Scott-Stokes draws a similar picture, condemning Fountaine as globetrotting \"obscure lady amateur\".[20]/nDuring Fountaine's lifetime entomology was very fashionable among the affluent in Britain, and natural history societies were well attended. Naturalist publications were no longer produced only by elite scientists. A popular scientific publication was Emma Hutchinson's 1879 book \"Entomology and Botany as Pursuits for Ladies\", which encouraged women to study butterflies instead of just collecting them. Natural history was particularly popular among women in the Victorian era.[21] Far from being eccentric, Fountaine's work as entomologist followed in the footsteps of Victorian amateur women scientists. A survey of The Entomologist's Record and Journal of Variation reveals that all editions, except the 1917 and the 1925 edition, have article contributions from women. However, Fountaine's membership of learned societies was pioneering. In 1910 the Royal Entomological Society only had six female fellows.[22]/nIn 1971 A. H. B. Rydon named the butterfly genus Fountainea in Fountaine's honour.[23] Kenneth J. Morton named the Odonata species Ischnura fountainei in Fountain's honour after she collected the type specimen of the species.[24]/nFountaine's illustrations of African flora and fauna were featured in the 2019 Natural History Museum exhibition, Expeditions and Endeavours.[25] Her illustrations have also been featured in the Natural History Museum 2014 publication, Women Artists: Images of Nature by Andrea Hart.[26][27]", "28357849": "Gundu Hirisave Rama Rao[1][2] is an Indian scientist, entrepreneur and Emeritus Professor at the Academic Health Center, University of Minnesota in the United States.

With seed money of US$10, 000 from the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis, USA, he started a professional Society called The South Asian Society for Atherosclerosis and Thrombosis (SASAT) in Minnesota to create awareness and develop educational and preventive programs of the prevention of these diseases in South Asians. He has been organizing international conferences on Atherosclerosis and Thrombosis, in India (Mumbai 1994, Bangalore 1996, New Delhi 1998, Mumbai 2000, Chennai 2002, Hyderabad 2004, Bangalore 2008, New Delhi 2007, 2008).

He is also working on establishing a platform in India to develop biomarker assays for the early detection of cancer and cardiovascular diseases and hand held medical devices for monitoring these assays. Another area of interest is development of indigenous drugs and cost effective self-diagnostic medical devices. To accomplish these goals he established a company in Bengaluru: aayusmart (www.aayusmart.com). For the first time anywhere in the world this company is trying to provide access to the individuals the health records via web (mobile personal health records: mPHRs).

Diagnosis of diseases also will necessitate the need for cost effective treatment plans. Serious considerations will be given to develop a total integrative health management to cover the largest section of society. One example of simplification that we are contemplating is to develop capability to do all the blood chemistry on a cell phone like platform, so that data could be obtained with a drop of blood, stored and transmitted to a web based consulting platform or to a personal physician for further interpretation and advise. Similarly, we could also include on such a mobile platform diagnostic capability to monitor pulse flow of the blood in regional vascular beds or to monitor the heart rate, EKG (ECG) blood oxygen and various other parameters. By exploring these avenues we will be able to bring the clinic to the individual instead of individual going to clinic for normal risk factor detection and management./nAnother area of interest is creation of awareness and education of the individuals. Indian Space Research Organization has a dedicated satellite (EDUSAT). They have connected tele-terminals to more than 10, 000 colleges. This vast network could be used for educational purposes for a nominal cost. Using SASAT platform, he is planning to create a wide educational network./nIndia is ranked number one in the list of nations with highest incidence of Type-2 diabetes. There are more than 30 million adults who suffer from this disease. There are equal numbers of people who have the disease and not diagnosed. To add to this complexity millions of individuals are in pre-diabetic condition. According to WHO estimate this number will increase by 200% in the net decade. Individuals with diabetes have 2-4 fold higher risks to have acute vascular events such as heart attack or stroke. Indians have the highest incidence of coronary artery disease compared to any other ethnic group in the world. To create awareness and develop educational and preventive programs Dr Rao started SASAT in USA in 1993. Prevention of these chronic metabolic diseases is cost effective and is probably the only choice for the masses. Even if the risk factors for these diseases are detected early, not all individuals can afford the expensive treatment options./nIt has been estimated that one third of all the children born in India are of low birth weight (LBW). Many studies have demonstrated that these LBW babies are at risk for developing hypertension, diabetes and vascular diseases. One way to reduce this health burden is to develop a strong maternal nutrition program for the pregnant women, so that the number of LBW newborn can be drastically reduced./nThe general diet of South Asians by and large is very rich in carbohydrates and this puts a great demand on the insulin secretion. It is therefore essential to improve the general diet of the population. Fortification of foods with nutrients is one cost-effective choice. Alternately genetic engineering of better cereals, fruits and vegetable also could be encouraged. Finally it is very well established that life style changes reduce the disease burden of chronic diseases.

Ingram used electrophoresis and chromatography to show that the amino acid sequence of normal human and sickle cell anaemia haemoglobins differed due to a single substituted amino acid residue. Much of this work was done with the support of Max Perutz and Francis Crick.  Ingram won the William Allan Award from the American Society of Human Genetics in 1967./nThis was the first time a researcher demonstrated that a single amino acid exchange in a protein can cause a disease or disorder.

She completed her degree in botany and zoology and then joined Poncet in France, where they were married in 1974.  The couple made plans to sail on Damien II through the Southern Ocean[4] and set sail in 1976[3] aboard the 50-foot steel schooner for Antarctica.[6]/nArriving in 1977,[7] the couple prepared to do a series of population censuses of the wildlife.[3] In 1978, they spent the winter in Marguerite Bay on the Antarctic Peninsula,[8] where Poncet began a survey of the seabirds of the area[9] and a count of elephant seals. The following year, Poncet gave birth to her first son, Dion on South Georgia Island. Their boat had become trapped in the ice and they were forced to wait until a British Research ship, the R R S Bransfield, was able to release their schooner. The couple sailed back to Tasmania for repairs, where their second son, Leiv was born in 1981. The following year, they returned to the Antarctic for the 1982-1983 bird season count and settled in the Falkland Islands. Their son Lars Nigel, nicknamed Diti, was born in the Falkland Islands in 1984.[3] Throughout the 1980s, Poncet worked in conjunction with the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) mapping locations of colonies around South Georgia and the Willis Islands of elephant seals, macaroni penguins and mollymawks.[10]/nIn 1987, couple leased a sheep farm in the Falkland Islands[3] and continued to spend up to four summer months each year sailing and studying the wildlife in South Georgia.[6] Poncet spent a decade surveying the birdlife of the region for the BAS.[11] In 1989, the couple were featured in National Geographic[6] (March, 1989) and in 1990, National Geographic Explorer presented a documentary \"Antarctic Adventure\", recounting the Poncets' journey to Antarctica and their explorations of the southern polar region.[3] Throughout the 1990s, Poncet continued her collaboration with the BAS, performing vegetation baseline studies.[10] Damien Bay was named after she and Jerome's boat, which had been chartered by the BAS for research.[12]/nIn 2001, concern about damage by tourists to the Cape Royds and Cape Evans areas in which Ernest Shackleton and Robert Falcon Scott had established expedition bases caused the Government of South Georgia & the South Sandwich Islands (GSGSSI) to hire Poncet to prepare an environmental assessment of the region[13] to establish an environmental baseline.[14] In 2002, Poncet began trials on a rat eradication project in an effort to restore the South Georgia pipit population.[7] The brown rat population, originally arriving on the island aboard ships in the 19th century, had caused extreme losses in the petrel, pipit and prion bird colonies.[15] It was the first such trial in South Georgia[7]  and a similar project on the Falklands led Poncet in 2011 to the discovery of a new breeding ground of southern giant petrel in the Choiseul Sound.[16] By 2013, the South Georgia project had cleared the area of rodents,[7] when Poncet reported the first pipit nest in Schlieper Bay of the eradication target area. The nest was found near Weddell Point during one of Poncet's expeditions tracking albatross. Since her report, numerous other nest sightings have occurred.[15]/nPoncet co-authored with Kim Crosbie two editions of the South Georgia Visitor\u2019s Guide. She has also worked with the GSGSSI as an advisor on reindeer eradication,[7] using humane methods to relocate the invasive species which has caused damage to vegetation.[17] In 2005, Poncet led the Petrel and Prion Survey team in work on a census of the wandering albatross. The count was triggered by concerns over the catastrophic death of the birds because of longline fishing.[18] Between 2005 and 2007, Poncet led a similar count of the giant petrel and white-chinned petrel colonies.[14] As the GSGSSI is committed to performing a survey on the wandering albatross every ten years, Poncet partnered with Cheesemans\u2019 Ecology Safaris in a public-private partnership in 2015 to offset costs of the census. Poncet led the scientific research conducted during the expedition.[19]/nIn 1992, Poncet and her husband were awarded the Blue Water Medal for their years of cruising in the Antarctic and publication of a guidebook focused on preservation of the region.[20] In 1995, she received the Gerdy Jevtic alumni medal from Fahan School.[5] Poncet was awarded the Fuchs Medal from the British Antarctic Survey in 2010 for her wildlife and vegetation mapping and conservation management strategies of the southern polar region.[10] In 2015, she was awarded the Polar Medal for her research and efforts at protecting the biodiversity of South Georgia and the Antarctic.[7]", "3487029": "Vasant G.

She and her colleagues found that the bacteria (commonly known as blue-green algae) produce an amino acid called BMAA that causes cell death and triggers the onset of the fatal disease.[7] The cyanobacteria can be ingested by drinking contaminated water and may even occur on fruits and vegetables washed in this water.[8] Additionally, BMAA may be responsible for the extremely high prevalence of the disease among the indigenous people of Guam, who eat fruit bats that have ingested the seeds of plants growing amongst the cyanobacteria. She suggests that the use of cyanobacteria in fertiliser production may even be linked to a higher incidence of motor neurone disease among certain athletes.[3] Other researchers have begun clinical trials of potential treatments based on this research.[9]/nRachael Dunlop became involved in the scientific skepticism movement in 2008 after meeting Australian Skeptics president Richard Saunders at a Skeptics in the Pub event.

The program teaches students to use science and critical thinking to investigate claims of the paranormal, such as water divining, spoon bending, and firewalking.[10]/nMuch of Dunlop's advocacy as a skeptic is focused on countering the claims of the anti-vaccination movement, specifically the Australian Vaccination Network (AVN) and its former president Meryl Dorey. In 2010 the AVN was ordered by the Health Care Complaints Commission to post a prominent warning on their website, but the organisation refused to comply and appealed the decision. In response, Dunlop and other skeptics organised a \"Google bomb\" so that Web searches for the name of the organisation resulted in several links to critical websites on the first page of results.[11] In 2009 the Australian Skeptics presented Dorey and the AVN with their Bent Spoon Award, which is \"presented to the perpetrator of the most preposterous piece of paranormal or pseudoscientific piffle\".

This became a focus of his early career.[8][10][6]/nWhile a NATO Postdoctoral Fellow at Cambridge University in England, Hazen worked with Charles Prewitt to determine empirical relations for the effect of temperature and pressure on interatomic distances in oxides and silicates.[8][11]/nIn 1976, Hazen joined the Carnegie Institution's Geophysical Laboratory as a research associate.[1] After a brief stint measuring optical properties of lunar minerals with Peter Bell and David Mao, he started to do X-ray crystallography with Larry Finger.[8] He later recalled, \"It was a match made in mineralogical heaven: Larry loved to write code, build machines, and analyze data; I loved to mount crystals, run the diffractometers, and write papers.\"[6] They collaborated for two decades and determined about a thousand crystal structures at variable pressures and temperatures, work summarized in their 1982 book Comparative Crystal Chemistry.[8][12]/nMuch of the work that Hazen was doing could be classified as mineral physics, a cross between geophysics and mineralogy. Although the field had pioneering contributions from the Nobel Prize winner Percy Bridgman and a student of his, Francis Birch, in the early- to mid-20th century, it did not have a name until the 1960s, and in the 1970s some scientists were concerned that a more interdisciplinary approach was needed to understand the relationship between interatomic forces and mineral properties. Hazen and Prewitt co-convened the first mineral physics conference; it was held on October 17\u201319, 1977 at the Airlie House in Warrenton, Virginia.[13]/nCooled to very low temperatures, some materials experience a sudden transition where electrical resistance drops to zero and any magnetic fields are expelled. This phenomenon is called superconductivity. Superconductors have a host of applications including powerful electromagnets, fast digital circuits and sensitive magnetometers, but the very low temperatures needed make the applications more difficult and expensive.  Until the 1980s, no superconductors existed above 21\u00a0K (\u2212252.2\u00a0\u00b0C). Then in 1986 two IBM researchers, Georg Bednorz and K. Alex M\u00fcller, found a ceramic material with a critical temperature of 35\u00a0K (\u2212238.2\u00a0\u00b0C). This set off a frenzied search for higher critical temperatures.[15]/nA group led by Paul Chu at the University of Houston explored some materials made of yttrium, barium, copper and oxygen (YCBO) and were the first to obtain a critical temperature above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. The YCBO samples had a mixture of black and green minerals, and although the researchers knew the average composition, they did not know the compositions of the two phases. In February 1987, Chu turned to Mao and Hazen, because they could determine the composition of small mineral grains in rocks. It took Mao and Hazen a week to determine the compositions; the black phase, which turned out to be the superconductor, was YBa2Cu3O7\u2212\u03b4.[16]/nMao and Hazen determined that the crystal structure of the superconducting phase was like that of perovskite, an important mineral in Earth's mantle.[17] Subsequently, Hazen's group identified twelve more high-temperature oxide superconductors, all with perovskite structures, and worked on organic superconductors.[18]/nBy the mid-1990s, Hazen felt that his research had reached a \"respectable plateau\" where the main principles of how crystals compress were known. The questions he was asking were increasingly narrow and the answers rarely surprising. So he changed research directions to study life's chemical origins.[19] This opportunity came when a colleague at George Mason University, Harold Morowitz, realized that the temperature and pressure at a hydrothermal vent might change the properties of water, allowing chemical reactions that ordinarily require the help of an enzyme. Enlisting the help of Hatten Yoder, a specialist in high pressure mineralogy, they tried subjecting pyruvate in water to high pressure, hoping for a simple reaction that would return oxaloacetate. Instead, an analysis by an organic geochemist, George Cody, found that they obtained tens of thousands of molecules.[20]/nThe publication of their results, which seemed to support the deep sea vent hypothesis,[21] met with heavy criticism, especially from Stanley Miller and colleagues who believe that life emerged on the surface. Along with the general criticism that organic compounds would not survive long in hot, high pressure conditions, they pointed out several flaws in the experiment. In his book, Genesis, Hazen acknowledges that Stanley Miller \"was basically right\" about the experiments, but argues that \"the art of science isn't necessarily to avoid mistakes; rather, progress is often made by making mistakes as fast as possible, while avoiding making the same mistake twice.\"[22] In subsequent work, the group formed biomolecules from carbon dioxide and water and catalyzed the formation of amino acids using oxides and sulfides of transition metals; and different transition elements catalyze different organic reactions.[18][6]/nOrganic molecules often come in two mirror-image forms, often referred to as \"right-handed\" and \"left-handed\". This handedness is called chirality. For example, the amino acid alanine comes in a right-handed (D-alanine) and a left-handed (L-alanine) form. Living cells are very selective, choosing amino acids only in the left-handed form and sugars in the right-handed form.[23] However, most abiotic processes produce an equal amount of each. Somehow life must have developed this preference (homochirality); but while scientists have proposed several theories, they have no consensus on the mechanism.[24]/nHazen investigated the possibility that organic molecules might acquire a chiral asymmetry when grown on the faces of mineral crystals. Some, like quartz, come in mirror-image forms; others, like calcite, are symmetric about their centers but their faces come in pairs with opposite chirality.[25] With Tim Filley, an expert at organic chemical analysis, and Glenn Goodfriend, a geochemist, Hazen cleaned large calcite crystals and dipped them into aspartic acid. They found that each face of the crystal had a small preference for either left- or right-handed forms of aspartate. They proposed that a similar mechanism might work on other amino acids and sugars.[26] This work attracted a lot of interest from the pharmaceutical industry, which needs to produce some of their drugs with a pure chirality.[8]/nAt a Christmas party in 2006, the biophysicist Harold Morowitz asked Hazen whether there were clay minerals during the Archean Eon. Hazen could not recall a mineralogist ever having asked whether a given mineral existed in a given era,[27][28] and it occurred to him that no one had ever explored how Earth's mineralogy changed over time. He worked on this question for a year with his closest colleague, geochemist Dimitri Sverjensky at Johns Hopkins University, and some other collaborators including a mineralogist, Robert Downs; a petrologist, John Ferry; and a geobiologist, Dominic Papineau. The result was a paper in American Mineralogist that provided a new historical context to mineralogy that they called mineral evolution.[29]/nBased on a review of the literature, Hazen and his co-authors estimated that the number of minerals in the Solar System has grown from about a dozen at the time of its formation to over 4300 at present. (As of 2017, the latter number has grown to 5300.[30]). They predicted that there was a systematic increase in the number of mineral species over time, and identified three main eras of change: the formation of the Solar System and planets; the reworking of crust and mantle and the onset of plate tectonics; and the appearance of life. After the first era, there were 250 minerals; after the second, 1500. The remainder were made possible by the action of living organisms, particularly the addition of oxygen to the atmosphere.[31][32][33][34][35] This paper was followed over the next few years by several studies concentrating on one chemical element at a time and mapping out the first appearances of minerals involving each element.[36]/nHazen and his colleagues started the Carbon Mineral Challenge, a citizen science project dedicated to accelerating the discovery of \"missing\" carbon-bearing minerals.[37]/nAs the Clarence B. Robinson Professor at George Mason University, Hazen developed innovative courses to promote scientific literacy in both scientists and non-scientists.[38] With physicist James Trefil, he developed a course that they described as \"science appreciation\", aimed at non-scientists. It was organized around a total of 20 \"Great Ideas of Science\" that were later reduced to 18.[39][40] In addition to writing about their ideas in several magazines, they turned the course into a book, Science Matters: Achieving Scientific Literacy. They used the principles to organize explanations of a \"vast number of socially significant, fundamental, or environmentally crucial topics.\"[41] This was published with an amount of advance publicity that was unusual for a popular science book, including an article they wrote for the New York Times Sunday Magazine,[42] praise from prolific author Isaac Asimov and physics Nobelist Leon Lederman, and a publicity tour.[41] For an article in Science about the book, they provided the author with the original list of 20 ideas and invited readers to send in their comments.[39] About 200 readers responded, generally supporting the idea of such a list while vehemently criticizing many of the particulars, including an informal style and sometimes vague language. Particularly criticized were numbers 1 (\"The universe is regular and predictable\") and 16 (\"Everything on the earth operates in cycles\").[43] Hazen and Trefil argued, in defense of point 1, that it was not intended as a defense of determinism and that they covered unpredictable phenomena like chaos;[43] but they also used the responses to modify the list of ideas in subsequent editions./nHazen and Trefil went on to write three undergraduate textbooks: The Sciences: An Integrated Approach (1993),[44] The Physical Sciences: An Integrated Approach (1995),[45] and Physics Matters: An Introduction to Conceptual Physics (2004).[46] Hazen used these as the basis for a 60-lecture video and audio course called The Joy of Science.[47][38]/nIn 2008, Hazen was an outgoing member of the AAAS Committee on Public Understanding of Science and Technology. He and his wife Margee, noting that it is important for scientists to engage with the public but actually doing so does not help them get tenure, proposed a new award, The Early Career Award for Public Engagement with Science, and established a fund for it.[48] The first award, with a monetary prize of $5,000, was announced in 2010.[49]/nHazen is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science./nThe Mineralogical Society of America presented Hazen with the Mineralogical Society of America Award in 1982 and the Distinguished Public Service Medal in 2009.[38][50] In 2016, he received its highest award, the Roebling Medal.[8][6] He also served as Distinguished Lecturer and is a Past President of the Society. A mineral that was discovered in Mono Lake was named hazenite in his honor by Hexiong Yang, a former student of his.[34]/nIn 1986, Hazen received the Ipatieff Prize, which the American Chemical Society awards in recognition of \"outstanding chemical experimental work in the field of catalysis or high pressure\".[51]/nFor the book The Music Men, he and his wife Margaret received the Deems Taylor Award from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers in 1989.[52]/nFor his popular and educational science writing, Hazen received the E.A.

The Indian Academy of Sciences (IAS) was the first to elect him in 1982,[24] followed by the Indian National Science Academy (INSA) in 1984.[3] The National Academy of Sciences, India (NASI) enrolled him as an elected fellow in 1988,[25] with The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) following suit in 1989[11] and the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences in 1990.[4] Besides, Chandra Shekhar Azad University of Agriculture and Technology and Banaras Hindu University, four other universities honored him with honorary doctorates.[11] He was one among the Indian scientists featured in the list of role model scientists in Reference Curve for Indian Role Model Scientists, a scientific study published in 2001 on the scientists and their work.[26]", "7484794": "Samuel Cate Prescott (April 5, 1872 \u2013 March 19, 1962) was an American food scientist and microbiologist who was involved in the development of food safety, food science, public health, and industrial microbiology./nPrescott was born in South Hampton, New Hampshire, the younger of two children. An older sister, Grace, later became a teacher in South Hampton, located near the Amesbury, Massachusetts area, located across the New Hampshire-Massachusetts state line. His formal education was in an ungraded schoolhouse in New Hampshire. During his fifteenth year, Prescott served as a \"rod man\" on a surveying crew to lay out the state line between eastern New Hampshire and Massachusetts./nIn 1888, he enrolled at the Sanborn Seminary in Kingston, New Hampshire, becoming a member of the first graduating class in 1890 which consisted of three girls and two boys. The seminary was a preparatory school for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT, then known as Boston Tech). It was there he met Allyne L. Merrill, an 1885 MIT graduate who helped Prescott enroll there in the fall of 1890.[1]/nMajoring in chemistry at MIT, Prescott had courses that had instructors such as James Mason Crafts in organic chemistry, Ellen Swallow Richards in sanitary chemistry, and William Thompson Sedgwick in bacteriology. Sedgwick would later become the first president of the Society of American Bacteriologists (SAB) in 1899\u20131901 (The SAB became the American Society for Microbiology in December 1960.)./nPrescott graduated with a S.B. degree in chemistry in 1894 after he wrote his senior research thesis entitled \"Salt as Nutrients for Bacteria\". The thesis was 37 pages long and handwritten. With the help of Sedgwick, chair of the Biology department at MIT, Prescott found his first position as an assistant chemist and biologist at the sewage treatment facility in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he worked for the rest of 1894 and part of 1895.[2]/nIn 1895, Prescott returned to MIT as an assistant to Sedgwick in the biology department and was promoted to instructor in 1896. During that time, William Lyman Underwood of the William Underwood Company, a food company founded in 1822 in Boston, Massachusetts, approached Sedgwick about product losses in his canned food product with swells and exploded cans despite the newest retort technology available. The only foreseeable option was to investigate for which Sedgwick detailed Prescott's assignment./nFrom late 1895 to late 1896, Prescott and Underwood worked on the problem every afternoon, specifically on canned clams, and discovered that the clams contained some heat-resistant bacterial spores that were able to survive the processing. Eventually, both men were able to determine that the clam's living environment also determined that if the bacteria was available and further found that the organisms could be killed if processed at 250\u00a0\u00b0F (121\u00a0\u00b0C) for ten minutes in a retort.[3]/nThe processing time-temperature studies also led to research of processing time-temperature studies of canned lobster, sardines, peas, tomatoes, corn, and spinach. Prescott and Underwood's work was first published in late 1896 with follow-up papers done from 1897 to 1926[4][5] This research, though important to the growth of food technology, was never patented.[6] It would also pave the way for thermal death time research that was pioneered by Bigelow and C. Olin Ball from 1921 to 1936.[7]/nWhile Prescott was doing his canning research, he also taught biology at MIT. This included courses in bacteriology, general biology, botany, genetics. He also rose through the ranks at MIT, moving to assistant professor in 1903 and associate professor in 1909 and even traveled through Europe during 1900, mainly Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, and France, to assist in research per Sedgwick's request. Prescott published papers on water bacteriology, milk bacteriology, and public health bacteriology from 1895 to 1910.[8]/nHis research would continue from 1910 to 1921 into banana fungal disease in Costa Rica in 1917 and 1918 that would lead to a disease-resistant banana.[9] During World War I, Prescott also was commissioned a United States Army major in the Sanitary Commission of the army medical department regarding the dehydration of food supplied to soldiers on the front line during the war. Serving from 1917 to 1919, Prescott received an honorable discharge and would actively serve in the United States Army Reserve until 1936, where he retired at the rank of colonel.[10][11]/nPrescott assumed the role of acting head of the Department of Biology and Public Health at MIT upon Sedgwick's death on January 25, 1921, and would be named department head on May 18, 1922. Prescott as department chair would change the focus from sanitary biology to industrial biology content with focus more on food technology, including recruiting more biochemistry and physiology faculty from 1922 and in later careers./nStudent recruitment would also increase, including the recruitment of future food scientists such as Philip K. Bates, Samuel A. Goldblith, and Bernard E. Proctor from the 1920s until 1940. When MIT underwent a reorganization following President Samuel Wesley Stratton's death in 1931, the new president Karl Taylor Compton selected Prescott as the first dean of MIT's School of Science the following year, a role Prescott would serve until his retirement in 1942; in the meantime, he would continue his role as head of the Biology and Public Health Departments, including continuing his food technology research.[12]/nEven while he was busy as department head and dean, Prescott continued working on research beneficial to the growth of food technology from 1921 to 1942. This would include research into coffee from 1923 to 1937 and would include future Nobel Laureate Robert Burns Woodward when Woodward was a graduate student at MIT.[13] He also worked on research in citric acid fermentation, refrigerated and frozen foods, and was instrumental in starting a new scientific journal named Food Research in 1936 (Journal of Food Science since 1961).[14] By this time, the need for a conference dealing with the growth of food technology and a possible society to be created was in process./nAs food technology grew from the individual family farm to the factory level, including the slaughterhouse for meat and poultry processing, the cannery for canned foods, and bakeries for bread as examples, the need to have personnel trained for the food industries. Literature such as Upton Sinclair's The Jungle in 1906 about slaughterhouse operations would be a factor in the establishment of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) later that year./nThe United States Department of Agriculture was also interested in food technology and research was also being done at agricultural colleges in the United States, including MIT, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, and the University of California, Berkeley.[15]/nBy 1935, both Prescott and Proctor (now on the MIT faculty) decided that it was time to hold an international conference regarding this.[16] A detailed proposal was presented to MIT President Compton in 1936 was presented with $1500 of financial aid from MIT for a meeting to be held from June 30 \u2013 July 2, 1937, with Compton asking how many people would be in attendance at this meeting. Prescott replied with \"fifty or sixty people.\" 500 people actually attended the event.[16]/nThis meeting proved so successful that in early 1938 that a second conference would be held in 1939. Initially led by George J. Hucker of the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station (part of Cornell University) in Geneva, New York, a small group meeting was held on August 5, 1938, on forming an organization with an expanded group meeting in New York City on January 16, 1939, to further discuss this.[17] The second conference was held at MIT June 29 to July 1, 1939, with Proctor as conference chair. 600 people attended this event./nAt the final session, the chairman of the session Fred C. Blanck of the United States Department of Agriculture, proposed that an organization be established as the Institute of Food Technologists. This was approved unanimously. Its first officers were Prescott as president, Roy C. Newton of Swift & Company in Chicago, Illinois, as vice president, and Hucker as secretary-treasurer.[17] By 1949, IFT had 3,000 members. Prescott was chosen as the first president because of his previous positions as presidents of two other professional organizations: the Society of American Bacteriologists in 1919 and the American Public Health Association in 1927\u20131928[18]/nFollowing his 1942 retirement, Prescott remained a busy man even becoming acting dean during 1944 when the current dean George Russell Harrison, a physicist, was called on assignment to Australia.[19] He also assisted during World War II in a ration survey per the United States Army, monitoring its history from 1789 to 1912 in three different time periods as part of the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps, and even worked as a special consultant to the quartermaster corps regarding food.[20] Prescott also wrote about the early history of MIT in a book published by the MIT Press in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1954 entitled When M.I.T. was \"Boston Tech\" (1861\u20131916).[21] He also remained active in IFT, both on the national level and in the Northeast Section (Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont) until his death in 1962.[22]/nPrescott died on March 19, 1962, shortly after suffering a stroke at 89.[23] Prior to his death in 1961, the Underwood Canning Company dedicated a new laboratory wing of their facility in honor of Prescott and Underwood.[24] After Prescott's 1962 passing, the Underwood company established the Underwood Prescott Memorial Lectureship that ran until 1982 when the Underwood Company was sold.[25]/nThe Institute of Food Technologists established the Samuel Cate Prescott Award in 1964 to honor young researchers in food science and technology for those who are under 36 years of age or who are a maximum ten years after earning their highest degree whichever is later. An Underwood Professorship was established in 1969 with an Underwood-Prescott Professorship followed up in 1972.[26] Three MIT faculty have held this professorship since its inception: Samuel A. Goldblith, Gerald N. Wogan, and since 1996, Steven R. Tannenbaum.[23][27]/nAll honors are at this reference[28] unless noted./nPrescott married Alice Chase (1884\u20131958) in June 1910 and remained married until her 1958 death.[33] They had three children, Robert Sedgwick Prescott (1911-?), Samuel Chase Prescott (1912\u20131976), and Eleanor Prescott Clemence (1914-?)[34][35] He also was an active writer both of technical textbooks,[35] and of poetry.[36] Prescott even wrote an award-winning essay for the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles on \"Can Children Be Saved from Death by Motor Cars\"[37] in the late 1920s.", "6272381": "Diosdado Sim\u00f3n Villares (Torremenga, October 15, 1954-C\u00e1ceres, April 28, 2002) was a Spanish researcher, biologist, botanist, tree surgeon and environmental teacher./nHe studied Biology in UCM, and investigated Extremaduran vegetation.

He is a distinguished University Professor of Health Science and Policy at the University of Pittsburgh./nBurke is a Distinguished University Professor[1] of Health Science and Policy at the University of Pittsburgh, and dean emeritus of the Graduate School of Public Health. Burke was the longest serving dean in the history of the school (2006-19). He is also the former associate vice chancellor for global health and director of the Center for Vaccine Research.[2]/nBurke is one of the world's foremost experts on the prevention, diagnosis, and control of emerging infectious diseases and infectious diseases of global concern, especially HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis A, and avian influenza. His research has spanned a wide range of scientific activities, including development of new diagnostics, field studies, clinical vaccine trials, computational modelling of epidemic control strategies, and health policy analysis.[3]/nBefore coming to Pittsburgh, Burke was Professor of International Health and Professor of Epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and Professor of Medicine at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. He was previously involved in infectious diseases research for several U.S. government agencies, retiring from the U.S. Army Medical Corps as a Colonel after 23 years of service. He has lectured widely on the history of microbiology and vaccines.[2]/nBurke is author or coauthor of over 200 scholarly papers.

As the discoverer of the specific causative agents of deadly infectious diseases including tuberculosis, cholera and anthrax, he is regarded as one of the main founders of modern bacteriology. As such he is popularly nicknamed the father of microbiology (with Louis Pasteur[3]), and as the father of medical bacteriology.[4][5] His discovery of the anthrax bacterium (Bacillus anthracis) in 1876 is considered as the birth of modern bacteriology.[6] Koch used his discoveries to establish that germs \"could cause a specific disease\"[7] and directly provided proofs for that germ theory of diseases, therefore creating the scientific basis of public health,[8] saving millions of lives.[9] For his life's work Koch is seen as one of the founders of modern medicine.[10][11]/nWhile working as a private physician, Koch developed many innovative techniques in microbiology. He was the first to use the oil immersion lens, condenser, and microphotography in microscopy. His invention of the bacterial culture method using agar and glass plates (later developed as the Petri dish by his assistant Julius Richard Petri) made him the first to grow bacteria in the laboratory. In appreciation of his work, he was appointed to government advisor at the Imperial Health Office in 1880, promoted to a senior executive position (Geheimer Regierungsrat) in 1882, Director of Hygienic Institute and Chair (Professor of hygiene) of the Faculty of Medicine at Berlin University in 1885, and the Royal Prussian Institute for Infectious Diseases (later renamed Robert Koch Institute after his death) in 1891./nThe methods Koch used in bacteriology led to establishment of a medical concept known as Koch's postulates, four generalized medical principles to ascertain the relationship of pathogens with specific diseases. The concept is still in use in most situations and influences subsequent epidemiological principles such as the Bradford Hill criteria.[12] A major controversy followed when Koch discovered tuberculin as a medication for tuberculosis which was proven to be ineffective, but developed for diagnosis of tuberculosis after his death. For his research on tuberculosis, he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1905.[13] The day he announced the discovery of the tuberculosis bacterium, 24 March 1882, has been observed by the World Health Organization as \"World Tuberculosis Day\" every year since 1982./nKoch was born in Clausthal, Germany, on 11 December 1843, to Hermann Koch (1814\u20131877) and Mathilde Julie Henriette (n\u00e9e Biewend; 1818\u20131871).[14] His father was a mining engineer. He was the third of thirteen siblings.[15] He excelled academically from an early age. Before entering school in 1848, he had taught himself how to read and write.[16] He completed secondary education in 1862, having excelled in science and math.[17]/nAt the age of 19, in 1862, Koch entered the University of G\u00f6ttingen to study natural science.[18] He took up mathematics, physics and botany. He was appointed assistant in the university's Pathological Museum.[19] After three semesters, he decided to change his area of study to medicine, as he aspired to be a physician. During his fifth semester at the medical school, Jacob Henle, an anatomist who had published a theory of contagion in 1840, asked him to participate in his research project on uterine nerve structure. This research won him a research prize from the university and enabled him to briefly study under Rudolf Virchow, who was at the time considered as \"Germany's most renowned physician.\"[15] In his sixth semester, Koch began to research at the Physiological Institute, where he studied the secretion of succinic acid, which is a signaling molecule that is also involved in the metabolism of the mitochondria. This would eventually form the basis of his dissertation.[13] In January 1866, he graduated from the medical school, earning honours of the highest distinction, maxima cum laude.[20][21]/nAfter graduation in 1866, Koch briefly worked as an assistant  in the General Hospital of Hamburg. In October that year he moved to Idiot's Hospital of Langenhagen, near Hanover, as a general physician. In 1868, he moved to Neimegk and then to Rakwitz in 1869. As the Franco-Prussian War started in 1870, he enlisted in the German army as a volunteer surgeon in 1871 to support the war effort.[19] He was discharged a year later and was appointed as a district physician (Kreisphysikus) in Wollstein in Prussian Posen (now Wolsztyn, Poland). As his family settled there, his wife gave him a microscope as a birthday gift. With the microscope, he set up a private laboratory and started his career in microbiology.[20][21]/nKoch began conducting research on microorganisms in a laboratory connected to his patient examination room.[18] His early research in this laboratory yielded one of his major contributions to the field of microbiology, as he developed the technique of growing bacteria.[22] Furthermore, he managed to isolate and grow selected pathogens in a pure laboratory culture.[22] His discovery of the anthrax bacillus (later named Bacillus anthracis) hugely impressed Ferdinand Julius Cohn, professor at the University of Breslau (now the University of Wroc\u0142aw), who helped him publish the discovery in 1876.[19] Cohn had established the Institute of Plant Physiology[23] and invited Koch to demonstrate his new bacterium there in 1877.[24] Koch was transferred to Breslau as district physician in 1879. A year after, he left for Berlin when he was appointed a government advisor at the Imperial Health Office, where he worked from 1880 to 1885.[25] Following his discovery of the tuberculosis bacterium, he was promoted to Geheimer Regierungsrat, a senior executive position, in June 1882.[26]/nIn 1885, Koch received two appointments as an administrator and professor at Berlin University. He became Director of Hygienic Institute and Chair (Professor of hygiene) of the Faculty of Medicine.[19] In 1891, he relinquished his professorship and became a director of the Royal Prussian Institute for Infectious Diseases (now the Robert Koch Institute) which consisted of a clinical division and beds for the division of clinical research. For this he accepted harsh conditions. The Prussian Ministry of Health insisted after the 1890 scandal with tuberculin, which Koch had discovered and intended as a remedy for tuberculosis, that any of Koch's inventions would unconditionally belong to the government and he would not be compensated. Koch lost the right to apply for patent protection.[27] In 1906, he moved to East Africa to research a cure for trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). He established the Bugula research camp where up to 1000 people a day were treated with the experimental drug Atoxyl.[28]/nRobert Koch made two important developments in microscopy; he was the first to use an oil immersion lens and a condenser that enabled smaller objects to be seen.[15] In addition, he was also the first to effectively use photography (microphotography) for microscopic observation. He introduced the \"bedrock methods\" of bacterial staining using methylene blue and Bismarck (Vesuvin) brown dye.[8] In an attempt to grow bacteria, Koch began to use solid nutrients such as potato slices.[22] Through these initial experiments, Koch observed individual colonies of identical, pure cells.[22] He found that potato slices were not suitable media for all organisms, and later began to use nutrient solutions with gelatin.[22] However, he soon realized that gelatin, like potato slices, was not the optimal medium for bacterial growth, as it did not remain solid at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, the ideal temperature for growth of most human pathogens.[22] And also many bacteria can hydrolyze gelatin making it a liquid. As suggested to him by his post-doctoral assistant Walther Hesse, who got the idea from his wife Fanny Hesse, in 1881, Koch started using agar to grow and isolate pure cultures.[29] Agar is a polysaccharide that remains solid at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, is not degraded by most bacteria, and results in a stable transparent medium.[22][30]/nKoch's booklet published in 1881 titled \"Zur Untersuchung von Pathogenen Organismen\" (Methods for the Study of Pathogenic Organisms)[31] has been known as the \"Bible of Bacteriology.\"[32][33] In it he described a novel method of using glass slide with agar to grow bacteria. The method involved pouring a liquid agar on to the glass slide and then spreading a thin layer of gelatin over. The gelatin made the culture medium solidify, in which bacterial samples could be spread uniformly. The whole bacterial culture was then put in a glass plate together with a small wet paper. Koch named this container as feuchte Kammer (moist chamber). The typical chamber was a circular glass dish 20\u2009cm in diameter and 5\u2009cm in height and had a lid to prevent contamination. The glass plate and the transparent culture media made observation of the bacterial growth easy.[34]/nKoch publicly demonstrated his plating method at the Seventh International Medical Congress in London in August 1881. There, Louis Pasteur exclaimed, \"C'est un grand progr\u00e8s, Monsieur!\" (\"What a great progress, Sir!\")[20] It was using Koch's microscopy and agar-plate culture method that his students discovered new bacteria. Friedrich Loeffler discovered the bacteria of glanders (Burkholderia mallei) in 1882 and diphtheria (Corynebacterium diphtheriae) in 1884; and Georg Theodor August Gaffky, the bacterium of typhoid (Salmonella enterica) in 1884.[35] Koch's assistant Julius Richard Petri developed an improved method and published it in 1887 as \"Eine kleine Modification des Koch\u2019schen Plattenverfahrens\" (A minor modification of the plating technique of Koch).[36] The culture plate was given an eponymous name Petri dish.[37] It is often asserted that Petri developed a new culture plate,[15][38][39] but this was not so. He simply discarded the use of glass plate and instead used the circular glass dish directly, not just as moist chamber, but as the main culture container. This further reduced chances of contaminations.[29] It would also have been appropriate if the name \"Koch dish\" had been given.[34]/nRobert Koch is widely known for his work with anthrax, discovering the causative agent of the fatal disease to be Bacillus anthracis.[40] He published the discovery in a booklet as \"Die \u00c4tiologie der Milzbrand-Krankheit, Begr\u00fcndet auf die Entwicklungsgeschichte des Bacillus Anthracis\" (The Etiology of Anthrax Disease, Based on the Developmental History of Bacillus Anthracis) in 1876 while working at in W\u00f6llstein.[41] His publication in 1877 on the structure of anthrax bacterium[42] marked the first photography of a bacterium.[15] He discovered the formation of spores in anthrax bacteria, which could remain dormant under specific conditions.[18] However, under optimal conditions, the spores were activated and caused disease.[18] To determine this causative agent, he dry-fixed bacterial cultures onto glass slides, used dyes to stain the cultures, and observed them through a microscope.[43] His work with anthrax is notable in that he was the first to link a specific microorganism with a specific disease, rejecting the idea of spontaneous generation and supporting the germ theory of disease.[40]/nDuring his time as the government advisor with the Imperial Health Agency in Berlin in the 1880s, Koch became interested in tuberculosis research. At the time, it was widely believed that tuberculosis was an inherited disease. However Koch was convinced that the disease was caused by a bacterium and was infectious. In 1882, he published his findings on tuberculosis, in which he reported the causative agent of the disease to be the slow-growing Mycobacterium tuberculosis.[22] He published the discovery as \"Die \u00c4tiologie der Tuberkulose\" (The Etiology of Tuberculosis),[30] and presented before the German Physiological Society at Berlin on 24 March 1882. Koch said,/nWhen the cover-glasses were exposed to this staining fluid [methylene blue mixed with potassium hydroxide] for 24 hours, very fine rod-like forms became apparent in the tubercular mass for the first time, having, as further observations showed, the power of multiplication and of spore formation and hence belonging to the same group of organisms as the anthrax bacillus... Microscopic examination then showed that only the previously blue-stained cell nuclei and detritus became brown, while the tubercle bacilli remained a beautiful blue.[20][21]/nThere was no particular reaction to this announcement. Eminent scientists such as Rudolf Virchow remained skeptical. Virchow clung to his theory that all diseases are due to faulty cellular activities.[44] On the other hand, Paul Ehrlich later recollected that this moment was his \"single greatest scientific experience.\"[5] Koch expanded the report and published under the same title as a booklet in 1884, in which he concluded that the discovery of tuberculosis bacterium fulfilled the three principles, eventually known as Koch's postulates, which were formulated by his assistant Friedrich Loeffler in 1883, saying:/nAll these factors together allow me to conclude that the bacilli present in the tuberculous lesions do not only accompany tuberculosis, but rather cause it. These bacilli are the true agents of tuberculosis.[44]/nIn August 1883, the German government sent a medical team led by Koch to Alexandria, Egypt, to investigate a cholera epidemic there.[45] Koch soon found that the intestinal mucosa of people who died of cholera always had bacterial infection, yet could not confirm whether the bacteria were the causative pathogens. As the outbreak in Egypt declined, he was transferred to Calcutta (now Kolkata) India, where there was a more severe outbreak. He soon found that the river Ganges was the source of cholera. He performed autopsies of almost 100 bodies, and found in each bacterial infection. He identified the same bacteria from water tanks, linking the source of the infection.[15] He isolated the bacterium in pure culture on 7 January 1884. He subsequently confirmed that the bacterium was a new species, and described as \"a little bent, like a comma.\"[46] His experiment using fresh blood samples indicated that the bacterium could kill red blood cells, and he hypothesized that some sort of poison was used by the bacterium to cause the disease.[15] In 1959, Indian scientist Sambhu Nath De discovered this poison, the cholera toxin.[47] Koch reported his discovery to the German Secretary of State for the Interior on 2 February, and published it in the Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift (German Medical Weekly) the following month.[48]/nAlthough Koch was convinced that the bacterium was the cholera pathogen, he could not entirely establish a critical evidence the bacterium produced the symptoms in healthy subjects (following Koch's postulates). His experiment on animals using his pure bacteria culture did not cause the disease, and correctly explained that animals are immune to human pathogen. The bacterium was then known as \"the comma bacillus\", and scientifically as Bacillus comma.[49] It was later realised that the bacterium was already described by an Italian physician Filippo Pacini in 1854,[50] and was also observed by the Catalan physician Joaquim Balcells i Pascual around the same time.[51][52] But they failed to identify the bacterium as the causative agent of cholera. Koch's colleague Richard Friedrich Johannes Pfeiffer correctly identified the comma bacillus as Pacini's vibrioni and renamed it as Vibrio cholera in 1896.[53]/nKoch gave much of his research attention on tuberculosis throughout his career. After medical expeditions to various parts of the world, he again focussed on tuberculosis from the mid-1880s. By that time the Imperial Health Office was carrying out a project for disinfection of sputum of tuberculosis patients. Koch experimented with arsenic and creosote as possible disinfectants. These chemicals and other available drugs did not work.[15] His report in 1883 also mentioned a failed experiment on an attempt to make tuberculosis vaccine.[26] By 1888, Koch turned his attention to synthetic dyes as antibacterial chemicals. He developed a method for examining antibacterial activity by mixing the gelatin-based culture media with a yellow dye, auramin. His notebook indicates that by February 1890, he tested hundreds of compounds.[5] In one of such tests, he found that an extract from the tuberculosis bacterium culture dissolved in glycerine could cure tuberculosis in guinea pigs. Based on a series of experiments from April to July 1891, he could conclude that the extract did not kill the tuberculosis bacterium, but destroyed (by necrosis) the infected tissues, thereby depriving bacterial growth. He made a vague announcement in August 1890 at the Tenth International Medical Congress in Berlin,[44] saying,/nIn a communication which I made a few months ago to the International Medical Congress [in London in 1881], I described a substance of which the result is to make laboratory animals insensitive to inoculation of tubercle bacilli, and in the case of already infected animals, to bring the tuberculous process to a halt.[20][21]\nI can tell [\u2026] that much, that guinea pigs, which are highly susceptible to the disease [tuberculosis], no longer react upon inoculation with tubercle virus [bacterium] when treated with that substance and that in guinea pigs, which are sick (with tuberculosis), the pathological process can be brought to a complete standstill.[5]/nBy November 1890, Koch was able to show that the extract was effective in humans as well.[54] Many patients and doctors went to Berlin to get Koch's remedy.[15] But his experiments showed that tuberculosis infected guinea pigs developed severe symptoms when the substance was inoculated. The severity was more so in humans.[44] This development of severe immune response, which is now known to be due to hypersensitivity, is known as the \"Koch phenomenon.\"[55] The chemical nature was not known, and among several independent experiments done by the next year, only his son-in-law, Eduard Pfuhl, was able to reproduce similar results.[5] It nevertheless became a medical sensation, and the unknown substance was referred to as \"Koch's Lymph.\" Koch published his experiments in the 15 January 1891 issue of Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift,[56][57] and The British Medical Journal immediately published the English version simultaneously.[58] The English version was also reproduced in Nature,[59] and The Lancet in the same month.[60] The Lancet presented it as \"glad tidings of great joy.\"[54] Koch simply referred to the medication as \"brownish, transparent fluid.\"[16] Josephs Pohl-Pincus had used the name tuberculin in 1844 for tuberculosis culture media,[61] and Koch subsequently adopted as \"tuberkulin.\"[62]/nThe first report on the clinical trial in 1891 was disappointing. By then 1061 patients with tuberculosis of internal organs and of 708 patients with tuberculosis of external tissues were given the treatment. An attempt to use tuberculin as a therapeutic drug is regarded as Koch's \"greatest failure.\"[44] With it his reputation greatly waned. But he devoted the rest of his life trying to make tuberculin as a usable medication.[54] His discovery was not a total failure, the substance is today used for hypersensitivity test for tuberculosis patients.[15]/nKoch observed the phenomenon of acquired immunity. On 26 December 1900, he arrived as part of an expedition to German New Guinea, which was then a protectorate of the German Reich. Koch serially examined the Papuan people, the indigenous inhabitants, and their blood samples and noticed they contained Plasmodium parasites, the cause of malaria, but their bouts of malaria were mild or could not even be noticed, i.e. were subclinical. On the contrary, German settlers and Chinese workers, who had been brought to New Guinea, fell sick immediately. The longer they had stayed in the country, however, the more they too seemed to develop a resistance against it.[63]/nDuring his time as government advisor, Koch published a report on how he discovered and experimentally showed tuberculosis bacterium as the pathogen of tuberculosis. He described the importance of pure cultures in isolating disease-causing organisms and explained the necessary steps to obtain these cultures, methods which are summarized in Koch's four postulates.[64] Koch's discovery of the causative agent of anthrax led to the formation of a generic set of postulates which can be used in the determination of the cause of most infectious diseases.[40] These postulates, which not only outlined a method for linking cause and effect of an infectious disease but also established the significance of laboratory culture of infectious agents, became the \"gold standard\" in infectious diseases.[65]/nAlthough Koch worked out the principles, he did not formulate the postulates, which were introduced by his assistant Friedrich Loeffler. Loeffler, reporting his discovery of diphtheria bacillus in 1883, stated three postulates as follows:[66]/nThe fourth postulate was added by an American plant pathologist Erwin Frink Smith in 1905, and is stated as:[68]/nIn July 1867, Koch married Emma (Emmy) Adolfine Josephine Fraatz, and the two had a daughter, Gertrude, in 1868.[13] Their marriage ended after 26 years in 1893, and later that same year, he married actress Hedwig Freiberg (1872\u20131945).[13]/nOn 9 April 1910, Koch suffered a heart attack and never made a complete recovery.[43] On 27 May, three days after giving a lecture on his tuberculosis research at the Prussian Academy of Sciences, Koch died in Baden-Baden at the age of 66.[18] Following his death, the Institute named its establishment after him in his honour. He was irreligious.[70]/nKoch was made a Knight Grand Cross in the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle on 19 November 1890,[71] and was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1897.[72] In 1905, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine \"for his investigations and discoveries in relation to tuberculosis.\"[73] In 1906, research on tuberculosis and tropical diseases won him the Order Pour le Merite and in 1908, the Robert Koch Medal, established to honour the greatest living physicians.[43] Emperor Wilhelm I awarded him the Order of the Crown, 100,000 marks and appointment as Privy Imperial Councillor,[8][16] Surgeon-General of Health Service, and Fellow of the Science Senate of Kaiser Wilhelm Society.[19]/nKoch established the Royal Prussian Institute for Infectious Diseases in Berlin 1891. After his death it was renamed Robert Koch Institute in his honour.[8]/nThe World Health Organization observes \"World Tuberculosis Day\" every 24 March since 1982 to commemorate the day Koch discovered tuberculosis bacterium.[16]/nKoch's name is one of 23 from the fields of hygiene and tropical medicine featured on the frieze of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine building in Keppel Street, Bloomsbury.[74]/nA large marble statue of Koch stands in a small park known as Robert Koch Platz, just north of the Charity Hospital, in the Mitte section of Berlin. His life was the subject of a 1939 German produced motion picture that featured Oscar winning actor Emil Jannings in the title role. On 10 December 2017, Google showed a Doodle in celebration of Koch's birthday.[75][76]/nKoch and his relationship to Paul Ehrlich, who developed a mechanism to diagnose TB, were portrayed in the 1940 movie Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet./nAt their first meeting at the Seventh International Medical Congress in London in August 1881, Koch and Pasteur were friendly towards each other. But the rest of their careers followed with scientific disputes. The conflict started when Koch interpreted his discovery of anthrax bacillus in 1876 as causality, that is, the germ caused the anthrax infections. Although his postulates were not yet formulated, he did not establish the bacterium as the cause of the disease: it was an inference. Pasteur therefore argued that Koch's discovery was not the full proof of causality, but Pasteur's anthrax vaccine developed in 1881 was.[77] Koch published his conclusion in 1881 with a statement: \"anthrax never occurs without viable anthrax bacilli or spores. In my opinion no more conclusive proof can be given that anthrax bacilli are the true and only cause of anthrax,\" and that vaccination such as claimed by Pasteur would be impossible.[78] To prove his vaccine, Pasteur sent his assistant Louis Thuillier to Germany for demonstration and disproved Koch's idea.[79] They had a heated public debate at the International Congress for Hygiene in Geneva in 1882, where Koch criticised Pasteur's methods as \"unreliable,\" and claimed they \"are false and [as such ] they inevitably lead to false conclusions.\"[16] Koch later continued to attack Pasteur, saying, \"Pasteur is not a physician, and one cannot expect him to make sound judgments about pathological processes and the symptoms of disease.\"[15]/nWhen Koch discovered tuberculin in 1890 as a medication for tuberculosis, he kept the experiment secret and avoided disclosing the source. It was only after a year under public pressure that he publicly announced the experiment and the source.[5] Clinical trials with tuberculin were disastrous and complete failures. Rudolf Virchow's autopsy report of 21 subjects treated with tuberculin to the Berlin Medical Society on 7 January 1891 revealed that instead of healing tuberculosis, the subjects died because of the treatment.[80] One week later, Koch publicised that the drug was a glycerine extract of a pure cultivation of the tuberculosis bacilli.[5] The German official report in late 1891 declared that tuberculosis was not cured with tuberculin.[44] From this moment onwards, Koch's prestige fell apart. The reason for his initial secrecy was due to an ambition for monetary benefits for the new drug, and with that establishment of his own research institute.[17] Since 1885, he had tried to leave government service and create an independent state-run institute of his own.[16] Following the disappointment, he was released from the University of Berlin and forced to work as Director of the Royal Prussian Institute for Infectious Diseases, a newly established institute, in 1891. He was prohibited from working on tuberculin and from claim for patent rights in any of his subsequent works.[27]/nKoch initially believed that human (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and cattle tuberculosis bacilli (now called Mycobacterium bovis) were different pathogens when he made the discovery in 1882. Two years later, he revoked that position and asserted that the two bacilli were the same type.[81] This later assumption was taken as a fact in veterinary practice. Based on it, legislations were made in US for inspection of meat and milk.[82] In 1898, an American veterinarian Theobald Smith published a detailed comparative study and found that the tuberculosis bacteria are different based on their structure, growth patterns, and pathogenicity. In addition he also discovered that there were variations in each type. In his conclusion, he made two important points:/nBy that time, there was evidence that cattle tuberculosis was transmitted to humans through meat and milk.[84][85] Upon these reports, Koch conceded that the two bacilli were different but still advocated that cattle tuberculosis was of no health concern. Speaking at the Third International Congress on Tuberculosis, held in London in July 1901, he said that cattle tuberculosis is not dangerous to humans and there is no need for medical attention.[16] He said, \"I therefore consider it unnecessary to take any measures against this form of TB. The fight against TB clearly has to concentrate on the human bacillus.\"[86] Chair of the congress, Joseph Lister reprimanded Koch and explained the medical evidences of cattle tuberculosis in humans.[87]/nThe Nobel Committee selected the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to be awarded for the discovery of the transmission of malaria. But it could not make the final decision on whom to give it to \u2014 the British surgeon Ronald Ross or the Italian biologist Giovanni Battista Grassi. Ross had discovered that the human malarial parasite was carried by certain mosquitoes in 1897, and the next year that bird malaria could be transmitted from infected to healthy birds by the bite of a mosquito.[88] Grassi had discovered Plasmodium vivax and the bird malaria parasite, and towards the end of 1898 the transmission of Plasmodium falciparum between humans through mosquitoes Anopheles claviger.[89] To the surprise of the Nobel Committee, the two nominees exchanged polemic arguments against each other publicly justifying the importance of their own works. Robert Koch was then appointed as a \"neutral arbitrator\" to make the final decision.[90] To his disadvantage, Grassi had criticised Koch on his malaria research in 1898 during an investigation of the epidemic,[89] while Ross had established a cordial relationship with Koch.[91] Ross was selected for the award, as Koch \"threw the full weight of his considerable authority in insisting that Grassi did not deserve the honor.\"[92]", "4732315": "James Fraser Kasting (born January 2, 1953) is an American geoscientist and Distinguished Professor of Geosciences at Penn State University.

Kasting joined Penn State University in 1988, but continues to collaborate with NASA.[1][6]/nHe is interested in atmospheric evolution, planetary atmospheres and paleoclimates.[5] Kasting writes about the geophysical history and status of the Earth, with a focus on atmospherics. He was well known among the geologists for his ground breaking idea on the only long term negative feedback for the atmospheric carbon dioxides: the carbon silica cycle. Together with his PhD student Alex Pavlov, they put a decisive mark on the post-GOE( Great Oxidation Event) oxygen level of greater than 1E-5 Present Atmospheric Level.\nAccording to Kasting's calculations, the Earth's oceans will evaporate in about a billion years, while the Sun is still a main sequence star.  This date is much earlier than previously thought.[7]  He has also considered the habitability criteria of other stellar systems and planets. A 1993 paper on habitable zones was particularly decisive in shaping thinking on this field.[8]/nKasting has published two books, The Earth System,[9] and How to Find a Habitable Planet,[10] along with more than 140 publications in research journals.[2] In their popular 2001 work Rare Earth:Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe, Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee note: \"Although many scientists have been doggedly pursuing the various attributes necessary for a habitable planet...one name stands out in the scientific literature: James Kasting.\"[11]:\u200a266/nKasting is also a member of numerous professional scientific societies and committees.

Friedl\u00e4nder's second communication on the micrococci of pneumonia, which appeared on 15 November 1883, touched off a controversy over the causative agent of pneumonia that continued for the next three years. In this second report he noted that he had examined more than 50 additional cases of pneumonia and that he had identified bacteria in nearly all of them and that sections from which the bacteria were absent were from the lungs of patients dying late in the course of the disease. Friedl\u00e4nder also noted that it was necessary to use special stains (e.g. the Gram Stain)[3] to see the bacteria because using ordinary stains (H&E) nuclei and fibrin stained the same way as bacteria and thus obscured the ability to see the bacteria.[4] As a result, Klebsiella pneumoniae is often called Friedl\u00e4nder's bacterium or Friedl\u00e4nder's bacillus.[5]  It is unclear if the bacteria that he observed in persons dying of pneumonia were truly all Klebsiella, some may well have been Streptococcus pneumoniae./nIn 1886, he introduced the ampoule in medicine./nHe died a premature death, aged 39 or 40, after a brief stint with a respiratory disease, believed to be caused by his discovered infectious organism, the Friedlander's Bacillus./n/nThis article about a German person in the field of medicine is a stub.

He became a full professor in University of Houston in 1963[2] where he founded and directed the department of biochemistry and biophysics. From the 1960s he worked with NASA on the Viking missions which explored the planet Mars.

This conjecture (formulated in 1961)[5] is broadly accepted today.  Although such an idea had been around for a long time, it was only when both space exploration and prebiotic chemistry fully developed that extensive evidence was in place. Comets are rich in carbon and water, bearing along precursor molecules based on carbon chemistry, such as amino acids.

In 1974, Mollison began his collaboration with Holmgren, and in 1978 they published their book Permaculture One, which introduced this design system to the general public. Mollison is also the developer of the herb spiral, a herb growing structure that allows herbs with different growing requirements to coexist in a small space.[4]/nMollison founded The Permaculture Institute in Tasmania, and created the education system to train others under the umbrella of permaculture.[5] This education system of \"train the trainer\", utilized through a formal Permaculture Design Course and Certification (PDC), has taught hundreds of thousands of people throughout the world how to grow food and be sustainable using permaculture design principles./nBruce Charles \"Bill\" Mollison was born in 1928, in the Bass Strait fishing village of  Stanley located on the north-west part of Tasmania, Australia.[6] He moved from Tasmania to Tyalgum in the Tweed Valley of northern New South Wales in 1987 where he lived for the next decade before returning to Tasmania.[5] He spent his final years in Sisters Beach in north-west Tasmania.[7] He died in Hobart, Tasmania, in 2016, aged 88. He is survived by his fifth wife Lisa, four daughters, and two sons.[8][9]/nMollison left school at age 15 to help run the family bakery. In the following ten years he worked as a shark fisherman, seaman, forester, mill worker, trapper, snarer, tractor-driver and naturalist.[7]/nIn 1954, at the age of 26, Mollison joined and worked for the 'Wildlife Survey Section' of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).[10] In the 1960s, he worked as a curator at the Tasmanian Museum. He also worked with the Inland Fisheries Commission, where he was able to resume his field work. In 1966, he entered the University of Tasmania. After he received his degree in bio-geography, he stayed on to lecture and teach, and developed the unit of Environmental Psychology.[10] He retired from teaching in 1979.[11]/nMollison's work with the CSIRO laid the foundation for his life-long passion: Permaculture.[10] Mollison told his student Toby Hemenway that the original idea for permaculture came to him in 1959 while he was observing marsupials browsing in the Tasmanian rain forests, because he was \"inspired and awed by the life-giving abundance and rich interconnectedness of this eco-system.\"[12] At that moment, Mollison jotted down the following words in his diary: \"I believe that we could build systems that would function as well as this one does.\"[12] By the late 1960s, he started developing ideas about stable agricultural systems on the southern Australian island state of Tasmania. This resulted from his own personal observations of the growth and use of the industrial-agricultural methods that he believed had rapidly degraded the soil of his native state.[13] In his view, these same methods posed a danger because they were highly dependent on non-renewable resources, and were additionally poisoning land and water, reducing biodiversity, and removing billions of tons of topsoil from previously fertile landscapes.[11] Writes Mollison:/nAfter many years as a scientist with the CSIRO Wildlife Survey Section and with the Tasmanian Inland Fisheries Department, I began to protest against the political and industrial systems I saw were killing us and the world around us. But I soon decided that it was no good persisting with opposition that in the end achieved nothing. I withdrew from society for two years; I did not want to oppose anything ever again and waste time. I wanted to come back only with something very positive, something that would allow us all to exist without the wholesale collapse of biological systems.[11]/nIn 1974\u201375, he and David Holmgren \"jointly evolved a framework for a sustainable agricultural system based on a multi-crop of perennial trees, shrubs, herbs (vegetables and weeds), fungi, and root systems\" for which they coined the word \"permaculture\".[13]   Holmgren was a student at the radical Environmental Design School in the Tasmanian College of Environmental Education.  Mollison was a senior tutor in the Psychology Dept of the University of Tasmania.\"[14]/nOriginally intended as a contraction of permanent agriculture, Mollison quickly realised it was a system for permanent culture, as without a productive landscape, a healthy ecology and a circular economy, no culture would survive. Permaculture began as both a positive concept \u2013 open to new information \u2013 and a practice that could integrate the knowledge about sustainable, ecological techniques from all parts of the world./nSoon after permaculture was first introduced and then put into practice by the public, Mollison recognized that permaculture principles encompassed a movement that included not only agriculture, horticulture, architecture, and ecology, but also economic systems, land access strategies, and legal systems for businesses and communities:/nAs I saw permaculture in the 1970s, it was a beneficial assembly of plants and animals in relation to human settlements, mostly aimed towards household and community self-reliance, and perhaps as a \"commercial endeavor\" only arising from a surplus from that system. However, permaculture has come to mean more than just food-sufficiency in the household. Self-reliance in food is meaningless unless people have access to land, information, and financial resources. So in recent years it has come to encompass appropriate legal and financial strategies, including strategies for land access, business structures, and regional self-financing. This way it is a whole human system.[11]/nHe helped found the first Permaculture Institute, established in 1979 to \"teach the practical design of sustainable soil, water, plant, and legal and economic systems to students worldwide.\" Bill Mollison taught the first Permaculture Design course at Stanley, Tasmania in January 1980.

Gibson is a glial and circadian biologist as well as an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and the Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine at Stanford University. Gibson investigates the role of glial cells in sculpting neural circuits and mechanistically probes how the circadian rhythm modulates glial biology./nGibson grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, and attended Whitfield School for her secondary education.[1] Gibson became interested in neuroscience after participating in a research internship at Washington University in St. Louis, an opportunity encouraged by her biology teacher.[1]/nAfter graduating from high school in 2001, Gibson went on to pursue her undergraduate degree at Duke University where she followed her interests and majored in psychology and neuroscience.[2] As an undergraduate researcher, Gibson worked under Christina Williams in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience.[3] In Williams' lab, Gibson explored how nutrients and hormones alter brain development and behavior.[4] Gibson graduated from Duke in 2005 with a Bachelors of Science degree.[2] The work that Gibson completed in the Williams laboratory was realized in 2007 when she became second author on a paper in the European Journal of Neuroscience reporting the role of prenatal choline in modulating hippocampal neurogenesis.[5] Her undergraduate work also helped elucidate that prenatal choline supplementation alleviates age-related declines in exploratory behavior in rats.[6]/nIn 2006, Gibson moved to the West Coast to pursue her graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley,[2] where she joined the lab of Lance Kriegsfeld to study the role of the circadian system in regulating biological processes.[2]/nEarly on in her graduate studies, Gibson published a paper in Endocrinology exploring the mechanisms by which the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) mediates the preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge in the female reproductive cycle.[7] She discovered a novel mammalian RFamide-related peptide (RFRP) that acted upstream of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to inhibit its release and prevent an LH surge throughout most of the reproductive cycle.[7] They explored the role of the SCN in regulating the cells that release RFRP and they found that when the SCN is active, RFRP releasing cells have decreased activity, and the GnRH system is active.[7]\u00a0These findings highlight a novel mechanism by which the SCN regulates the LH surge in ovulation through releasing inhibition on the GnRH system.[7] Gibson then later helped write a review on the role of RFRP-3 in regulating GnRH in mammals highlighting the implications of studying circadian biology in the context of reproductive physiology and the neural control of sexual behaviors.[7]/nIn 2010, Gibson published a paper highlighting the effects of experimental \"jet lag\" on adult neurogenesis and cognition.[8] To explore how circadian disruptions affect the brain, Gibson used a technique called experimental jet lag where she introduced phase advances in the light:dark cycle of female hamsters, similar to phase shifts one might experience when traveling to a new time zone.[8] She found that experimental \"jet lag\" caused pronounced decreases in hippocampal cell proliferation and neurogenesis leading to notable deficits in learning and memory.[8] Although the circadian perturbations disrupted the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis, the decreases in hippocampal cell proliferation and neurogenesis were not due to cortisol or stress hormones.[8] Further, the negative effects of jet lag on brain health extend beyond the duration of the jet lag itself as hamsters show long lasting decreases in neurogenesis and hippocampal function.[9] Her findings on the effects of circadian disruption on learning and memory highlight the implications of international travel on cognitive function.[10] Her work was highlighted in ABC Science, The Wall Street Journal, NPR and Time.[11] Gibson's thesis, titled \"The Role of the Circadian System in Reproductive, Neural, and Immune Health\" summarized her experimental findings during her graduate work to emphasize the importance of circadian biology in health and disease.[9]/nAfter completing her graduate studies in 2011, Gibson pursued her postdoctoral work at Stanford in the lab of Michelle Monje where she studied the effects of neural activity on myelin microstructure in health and disease.[2]/nWhile modern cancer therapies have provided hope and extended the lives of many patients, major side effects of both cranial radiation and chemotherapeutic agents include deficits in memory, attention, and concentration.[12] Gibson sought to understand how chemotherapy alter the brain by focusing her attention on glial cells, particularly myelin-making glial cells called oligodendrocytes since demyelinating disorder is associated with chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment.[2] Gibson first focused her attention on probing if and how neural activity affects myelin formation in the central nervous system. In 2014, she published a paper in Science showing that increases in neural activity, achieved by optogenetic stimulation, result in robust proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, which differentiate into oligodendrocytes and increase the thickness of the myelin sheath around neurons.[13] Her results highlight a potential avenue with which to treat demyelinating diseases through the modulation of neural activity.[13]  In 2019, Gibson published a paper in Cell probing the dysfunctional glial interactions that give rise to chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment.[14] After developing a mouse model of methotrexate chemotherapy-induced neurological dysfunction, Gibson and her colleagues found decreases in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs).[14] They later found that methotrexate activates microglia which then activate astrocytes leading to a pro-inflammatory environment which seems to deplete white matter OPCs.[14] By inhibiting microglial activation, Gibson was able to restore OPC levels, showing that microglia could be a target to eliminate the negative effects of chemotherapy on brain homeostasis.[14] In a follow-on paper in Neuron, Gibson and her colleagues showed that the loss of adaptive myelin contributes to the chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment further emphasizing the importance of targeting the source of OPC depletion in chemotherapy patients.[14]/nIn 2020, Gibson started her independent lab and became an assistant professor at Stanford University in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, the Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine, and Stanford University Medical School.[11] She is also a member of Bio-X at Stanford and the Maternal and Child Health Research Institute.[15] Gibson's lab explores the cellular and molecular mechanisms that modulate glial cells in the central nervous system.[15] Combining her postdoctoral and graduate work, Gibson has a particular interest in how the circadian clock regulates the biology of glial cells in the brain.[15]/nThroughout her time in academia, Gibson has been a vocal and fervent advocate for women in science, particularly mothers in scientific careers. Gibson is part of A Working Group of Mothers in Science, started by a professor at the University of California, Davis.[16] The group came together to address the childcare-conference conundrum in which women are less able to attend conference due to the lack of childcare available at these events.[16] Gibson has helped write pieces in Nature Jobs and Nature Careers discussing the matter and how to tackle it by making children and infants welcome at conferences.[17] \u00a0In 2020, Gibson also wrote a piece in Science addressing the importance of welcoming personal disclosures when institutions and review committees evaluate scientists' curricula vitae.[18] Personal disclosures will help to address the unforeseen life events that might impact ones' research and career trajectory but are often left unaccounted for, only noted as gaps in a scientists' curriculum vitae.[18]", "1586659": "Esko Jorma Johannes Valtaoja (pronounced [\u02c8esko \u02c8\u028b\u0251lt\u0251\u02ccoj\u0251] \u24d8; born 20 June 1951) is a Finnish professional astronomer and writer.

He has also been closely involved with the development of other biodiversity informatics initiatives including the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), AquaMaps, and the iPlant Taxonomic Name Resolution Service (TNRS)./nRees was born in Coventry, UK to an academic family[a] and studied for a degree in Plant Sciences at the University of Leeds from 1971-1974, publishing one paper on the description of a new chrysophyte alga from his undergraduate work.[5] Subsequently he obtained a Ph.D. from the same University, with a thesis entitled \"The phytoplankton of a eutrophic lake: community dynamics and ultrastructural studies\".[6][b] In the 1980s he worked for the Micropalaeontology Unit of the Geology Department at University College London[7] before migrating to Australia where he managed the electron microscope facility for the CSIRO Division of Fisheries until that facility's closure in 1996, whereupon he transitioned into the area of marine data management for the same science agency. In that position he combined oceanographic and marine biological data management[8] and developed an interest in the emerging field of biodiversity informatics, also including a role assisting the technical development of the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) being developed by J. Frederick Grassle in the U.S.A. From 2009-2014 he managed the Australian node of OBIS, located at CSIRO,[9] and also collaborated with other national and international biodiversity informatics and data sharing initiatives including the Encyclopedia of Life, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, the Atlas of Living Australia, the Open Tree of Life project, FishBase, and others. Rees left CSIRO in 2014, since when his Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera project has been hosted on data infrastructure at the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ) in Belgium, with which he continues an involvement as at 2022./nIn 2002 Rees devised a grid-based identification system \"c-squares\" for units of geographic space to which areas of scientific operation by particular research projects in his agency could be allocated;[10] by designing the system to cover any scale from global to local, c-squares was also a good fit for the initial spatial data handling of both the OBIS and the subsequent AquaMaps projects, in addition to its original implementation within CSIRO Fisheries' \"MarLIN\" metadata system. A 2006 upgrade of the \"c-squares mapper\" software to produce rotatable and zoomable \"globe views\" was an early, browser-based, implementation of a virtual globe,[11] pre-dating the eventual availability of the (far better specified) Google Earth software as a user-addressable web application./nIn 2003-2004, Rees was responsible for a redesign of the OBIS search and display software utilising both c-squares for rapid spatial search and mapping of the resulting marine species distribution information, and pre-indexing of all distributed content at a central data hub so that reliance on live, distributed queries to remote, federated data suppliers was removed; this redesign went live in the production version of OBIS in 2004.[12] At the same time, he introduced a \"backbone taxonomy\" for OBIS data holdings based on the then-latest (2003) edition of the Catalogue of Life, with individual names flagged as either marine or nonmarine, since OBIS wished to expose only the marine element of content supplied by external systems which did not always discriminate between records on the basis of habitat./nAware of taxonomic gaps in this last effort arising from incompleteness in the then Catalogue of Life, in 2006 Rees commenced a new taxonomic data compilation entitled the \"Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera\" (IRMNG) which attempted to list all published genera of the world and assign them either a marine, or nonmarine status (later this simple distinction was further broken down into marine/brackish/freshwater and terrestrial states), also an extant/fossil flag for the use of systems that wished in addition to discriminate between extant and fossil taxa. IRMNG, initially conceived as a short term data compilation project, turned out to be more complex to complete than initially envisaged and continues to the present time under the auspices first of CSIRO in Australia, then (2016 onwards) hosted at the Flanders Marine Institute (Dutch: Vlaams Instituut voor de Zee, VLIZ) in Belgium.[13][14][15]/nAn additional software tool developed by Rees is a method for spell checking scientific names of organisms entitled \"Taxamatch\" that aims for high recall (no candidate correctly spelled names missed) and also good precision (rejection of \"false hits\"), when an input (potentially misspelled) name is supplied and a list of correctly spelled names is available against which it can be tested.[16] This method has subsequently been adopted as a useful feature in a number of global taxonomic databases including the iPlant Taxonomic Name Resolution Service for plants,[17] the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) and its dozens of component individual databases,[18] the Euro+Med PlantBase[19] and the EU-NOMEN portal to the Pan-European Species directories Infrastructure (PESI)[20] in addition to its incorporation into IRMNG./nFor his work in the area of biodiversity informatics including that on c-squares, OBIS, IRMNG and Taxamatch, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) awarded Rees the 2014 Ebbe Nielsen Prize.[21] Part of the accompanying 2014 citation from GBIF reads:/nWard Appeltans, OBIS manager at UNESCO's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, said he was glad Rees' life work, dedication and perseverance were rewarded by this prestigious prize. \"Tony Rees has successfully combined two of his passions, informatics and biology, and with the right intuition and knowledge he has built solutions that have been used by thousands of scientists all over the world.\"[21]/nFor a period in the 2010s, Rees was a member of the Global Team of the Catalogue of Life, taking part in discussions regarding that projects's ongoing functionality and evolution.

Data from this initiative was used in a publication Mukerji was a contributor on, linking the genetic ancestry of the Siddi people from the Western region of India to Bantu-speaking East African tribes.[9]/nAnother study in which Mukerji used the IGV database is in studying keratinization genes, associated with waterproofing epidermal layers and being a contributor to different skin phenotypes for populations living in different climates. She wanted to see whether or not this gene responds to environmental stresses and how intensely or rapidly. Using an analysis of copy number variants and DNA and protein sequence differences amongst diverse Indian populations from varying climates, Mukerji makes conclusions about the changes within this area of skin-related genes and the role it plays in adaptations in response to environmental stimuli.[10]/nMukerji has also done significant work towards bettering clinical diagnostics processes of disorders in India. She worked particularly with a group of neurodegenerative diseases known as Cerebellar ataxias, a heritable condition in which the cerebellum portion of the brain becomes damaged. This condition is known to arise from a combination of many mutations, and so establishing a clear genetic correlation is difficult, making clinical screening difficult as well. Through tracing the disease ancestry and \"mutational history\", as well as a study of thousands of Indian families, Mukerji and her team were able to get a better understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms that cause ataxias and develop a clinical screening to be able to check disease susceptibility of healthy patients. This method is being used at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and helps reduce economical and medical stresses on families.[11] Further studies done by Mukerji show more evidence of the mechanisms behind ataxias. Her work in studying spinocerebellar ataxia identifies a repeat expansion mutation as the cause of the disorder. Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms in Indian and Mexican families show a shared expansion pattern in these two geographically distinct groups, making it possible to understand more about the ancestry of these particular mutations that cause this disease.[12]/nIn another study, Mukerji and her team analyzed another heritable neural disorder, dyslexia. They identified genes of a PCDHG cluster and pinpointed specific chromosomal locations of polymorphisms that contribute to the disorder. They also tracked the mutational history and lineages of these polymorphism, in both humans and other related primates. Their work helps better explain the mechanisms in play in dyslexia and the association of PCDHG genes with \"neural adhesion proteins\" that are related to cognitive functionality in primates.[13] Mukerji also studied active pulmonary tuberculosis in North Indian populations. Through a study of cytokine serum levels between patients with active tuberculosis and healthy individuals, Mukerji was able to identify five cytokine gene polymorphisms correlating to immunity against tuberculosis.[14]/nAlong with her other projects tracking mutational history and disease evolution, Mukerji also did work studying correlations between polymorphisms in the APOBEC3B gene and malaria susceptibility. Many versions of this gene with various insertions and deletions are found in human populations. Mukerji's study found a clear correlation between an insertion in this gene and populations with endemic levels of falciparum malaria, the most severe form of malaria, or in the genomes of descendants from such areas. Accordingly, their study also shows a strong correlation between a deletion in this gene and weakened defense against falciparum malaria. This provides direct evidence through population genetics survey that suggests that variants of the APOBEC3B have some effect on susceptibility to this form of malaria.[15]/nMukerji actively initiated the field of \"Ayurgenomics\", integrating the phenotyping Ayurveda principles of Indian medical system with \"objective parameters of modern medicine for identifying molecular endophenotypes.\" She states that she wants her research to be able to \"contemporize Ayurveda\" by finding valid molecular backing for Ayurvedic practices and being able to use both to better preventative medical practice.[5]  Her research on SNPs and CNV diversity in the Indian population as a part of the Indian Genome Variation Consortium provided genetic evidence for Ayurvedic \"Prakritis\", or subgroups of healthy individuals based on phenotypic differences that govern an individual's lifestyle and medical profile.[16] These \"Prakriti's\" are used for \"assessing disease susceptibility and drug responsiveness\", a concept that parallels ideas of personalized pharmaceuticals in Western Medicine.[17] One molecular example Mukerji and her team studied has to go with the EGLN1 gene, associated with oxygen retention in bodily tissues and the condition of hypoxia. Differences in this key gene are associated with high-altitude adaptations in particular populations, and agree with the distinguishing of different Prakriti's, giving a molecular basis for the ancient medical practice.[18] Mukerji has found other such biological markers that also support the Ayurvedic body types, such as levels of lipids.[5] A unique finding of her studies in genomics is \"that the ethnically and linguistically diverse Indian population was united by distinct DNA patterns\".[4] This has led to the inference that the genomics-based treatments of pharmacogenetics, also encompassing Ayurvedic practices, are possible.[citation needed]/nMukerji continued her study with hypoxia in examining and trying to decipher its correlation with asthma and other pulmonary conditions. The study, conducted on mice, used a pharmacologically induced hypoxic response to study how gene expression and induction factors are affected by the condition, and how this may lead to symptoms that cause the development of asthma. Mukerji and her team discovered that an exaggerated hypoxic response did indeed increase asthma in mice, even to fatal levels. This is clinically relevant as many pharmaceutical drugs function by tampering with these hypoxic response mechanisms, though the details of the mechanisms and its effects on the body are not well known.[19]/nIn January 2014, Mukerji gave a lecture at a TEDx event in New Delhi, India on the practice of personalized medicine through Ayurveda and its integration with modern medicine and genomics.[20]/nMukerji has received several prestigious awards. On 24 September 2001, she was awarded the CSIR Young Scientist Award. She then was nominated to be a member of HUGO, the Human Genome Organization, in 2006. She received the National Young Woman Bioscientists Award in 2008 and the prestigious Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award in 2010. In 2014, Mukerji became an elected fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences and in 2016, was awarded the VASVIK award for Women Scientists. Most recently, in 2017, Mitali Mukerji was awarded the Pushpalata Ranade National Woman Award.[21][22]/nMukerji has several technical publications to her credit.

Illegal capture for the pet bird trade, habitat destruction and feather collection for handicrafts were the main reasons for the drastic reduction in hyacinth macaw numbers.[1]/nNeiva was born in 1962, in Ponta Por\u00e3, in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul. Initially, Neiva wanted to study medicine and become a pediatrician, but she did not pass the entrance examination. Then she began taking part in the biology course which took place at night, allowing her to work during the day to help her family.[2]/nShe graduated in biology from the Universidade Federal do Mato Grosso do Sul in 1987. In 1990, she entered the master's degree program at Escola Superior de Agricultura Luiz de Queiroz, studying the reproductive biology of the hyacinth macaw of the Pantanal.[3]/nStill a recent graduate, in 1989 Neiva first saw the hyacinth macaw in the Pantanal. Upon discovering that they were in danger of extinction she reasoned that the best way to preserve the species would be to study the causes of their disappearance, monitoring the remaining individuals, mapping nests, counting eggs and chicks. At the time, there was little research on hyacinth macaws, and Neiva's research work was the main generator of information on hyacinth macaw populations, their ways of life and reproduction.[2][3]/nWhile studying for her master's, she travelled to the Pantanal from the municipality of Miranda, replicating her studies. With help from the World Wide Fund for Nature, she learned to climb trees to access the nests of the hyacinth macaws. Neiva discovered that hyacinth macaws are \"environmental engineers\" of nature: Their nests, which are built in cavities in trees, are also used by other species, and the macaws help spread seeds to more distant locations from the mother plant.[2][3]/nTowards the end of the 1980s it was estimated that the population of hyacinth macaws numbered less than 1500 individuals. By 2019, circa 6500 individual hyacinth macaws lived in the Pantanal alone, not counting additional individuals elsewhere in the cerrado biome.[3] Neiva's work also revealed that the main obstacle to the species' reproduction was the lack of nesting cavities for the animals and their young, causing birds to quarrel for the few good spaces available. Thus, Neiva and her co-workers started installing wooden nesting boxes on top of the trees. Farmers allowed the researchers to enter and install nesting boxes and even started planting trees to facilitate the hyacinth macaws' reproduction.[2][4]/nIn 2005, Neiva began her doctorate at the Universidade Estadual Paulista, where she successfully defended her thesis in 2009 on continuation of her work with the hyacinth macaws.[5] Today, Neiva is one of the most eminent specialists on hyacinth macaws in Latin America.

The report was immediately also heralded by conservative lawmakers opposed to embryonic stem cell research as proof that such research is not needed.[8] Skepticism surrounded the announcement from the beginning: Stuart Orkin from the Harvard Medical School noted, \"If the cells are what she says -- and I have no reason to dispute that but no one has demonstrated it yet -- it's pretty remarkable. For people interested in tissue regeneration, this would be the cell to work with.\"[9]/nVerfaillie was noted to immediately benefit from the interest in adult stem cells with her lab size and funding immediately doubling.[10] The discovery was considered so ground-breaking that she received several accolades in the first few years after the initial report. The British biomedical publication New Scientist declared it as the \"ultimate stem cell discovery\".[11] Problems with working with MAPCs proved difficult to several laboratories who were keen to co-operate in expanding the use of MAPCs.

First reports on potential problems with Verfaillie's group's work came in early 2007 when New Scientist reported that the 2002 Nature paper had some of the images appear in a second paper published at about the same time.[13] The article also revealed duplication of images in a 2001 paper on blood, authored by Verfaillie's trainee, Morayma Reyes, and that a patent application for the MAPCs was licensed to a company called Athersys, based in Cleveland, Ohio. A series of investigations into at least three instances of data duplication/fabrication by the University of Minnesota followed, which eventually concluded in October 2008 that Morayma Reyes had fabricated data in the 2001 paper.[citation needed]/nThe panel criticized Verfaillie's laboratory for \u201cpoor scientific method and inadequate training and oversight for this research\u201d. It contacted Blood and asked the journal to retract the paper. The investigators also found discrepancies with images in a second paper from Verfaillie's laboratory, published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation in 2002. Those problems did not rise to the level of academic misconduct, the university said.

In particular, she found that sites with a high diversity of methanotrophs, or bacteria that oxidize methane, have more stable levels of methane consumption, which suggested that managing lands to maintain methanotroph diversity could be a good way of managing levels of this greenhouse gas.

He also served as a member of the environmental education panel of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) and as a member of the National Advisory Council.[18] He is a member of the National Tiger Conservation Authority[17] and is the chairman of the committee proposing Environmental Education Curriculum at School level.[19] In 2010, when the Government of India constituted an expert panel, Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP), to examine the ecological issues related to the Western Ghats, he was selected as the chairman of the panel.[20]/nGadgil, an active sportsman during his college years, held the Maharashtra State Junior and Pune University high jump records in 1959 and 1961 respectively. He has also represented Pune University at the All India University Athletic meet.[21] He is married to Sulochana Gadgil, a noted meteorologist and a Harvard scholar, whom he met during his Fergusson College years.[14] The couple has a daughter, who is a journalist cum Spanish teacher, and a son, a mathematician.[11][14] The family lives in Pune, his home town. His life story has been recorded in a biographical book, Vidnyanyatri \u2013 Dr. Madhav Gadgil, written in Marathi by A. P. Deshpande.[22]/nOne of the major contributions of Gadgil is his effort towards the preservation of ecology of India. His early researches in the 1980s have helped in the identification of the Nilgiris as the first biosphere reserve in India.[17] As the chairman of the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP), which later came to be known as the Gadgil Commission, he submitted a report in 2011,[23] marking around 64 percent of the Western Ghats region as Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA).[18] The report attracted support and dissension,[24] the environmentalists welcoming the recommendations and the state governments of the neighbouring states and the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church of Kerala disapproving it.[20][23] This paved way for the subsequent Kasturirangan Commission, which diluted the recommendations to a level more acceptable to the state governments.[18] He has been credited by many with the introduction of quantitative investigations of ecology and animal behaviour in India and for including humans as a vital part of ecosystems.[17][25] His contributions, as a member of the draft committee, has been reported in the preparation of the Biological Diversity Act 2002[26] and the manual he prepared for the People's Biodiversity Registers has been accepted by the National Biodiversity Authority.[21] He is still associated with the Authority in the preparation of a biodiversity inventory at the local bodies' level.[21]/nGadgil is known to have done extensive researches in the areas of population biology, conservation biology, human ecology and ecological history. His researches have been documented by over 250 scientific articles,[10] published in various journals and magazines.[27] He developed a penchant for writing at an early age and his first publication was a series of ten articles on animal behaviour, published in Srishtidnyan, a Marathi language science magazine, when he was studying in the 10th standard.[17] His doctoral thesis is reported to have been a citation classic.[17][28] He published his first book in English, This Fissured Land, a book on the ecological history of India, in 1992.[29] The next book, Ecology and Equity: The Use and Abuse of Nature in Contemporary India,[30] again co-authored by Ramachandra Guha, was released in 1995, followed by Nurturing Biodiversity: An Indian Agenda, a book co-authored by P. R. Seshagiri Rao, in 1998.[31] In 2005, he published two books, Diversity\u00a0: The cornerstone of life[32] and Ecological Journeys.[33] As a part of his responsibilities as a Pew Fellow in Conservation and the Environment,[34] he has contributed towards the preparation of People's Biodiversity Registers and has published a manual, People's Biodiversity Registers: A Methodology Manual.[35][36] Some of his books have been translated into many languages and serve as texts for academic studies.[24] He has also published two books,[15] Nisarganiyojan Lokasahabhagane being one among them,[28] and over 40 articles in Marathi and handled a fortnightly column on natural history, in The Hindu, from 1999 till 2004.[21] He handles a monthly column in the Marathi daily, Sakal.[21]/nThe Indian National Science Academy (INSA) elected him as their Fellow in 1984.[10] Six years later, the two other major science academies of India, The Indian Academy of Sciences (IAS)[7] and the National Academy of Sciences, India (NASI), followed suit by electing him as a Fellow in 1990.[38] He is Fellow of the Third World Academy of Sciences (TWAS), an honorary Fellow of the Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation (ATBC) and a recipient of the National Environment Fellowship of the Ministry of Environment and Forests for his field research in the Western Ghats.[39] He was elected as a Foreign Associate of the US National Academy of Sciences in 1991[40] and he serves as a member of the British Ecological Society and Ecological Society of America.[3][39]/nThe Government of India awarded him the fourth highest civilian honour of the Padma Shri in 1981[6] and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), an autonomous government agency awarded him Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, the highest Indian award in the Science and Technology sector, in 1986.[41] In between, in 1983, the Government of Karnataka honoured him with Rajyotsava Prashasthi, their second highest civilian award.[21] His alma mater, Harvard University, presented him with the Harvard Centennial Medal, an annual honour given to its alumni for their achievements in their respective field of service, in 2002.[42] The next year, he shared the 2003 Volvo Environment Prize of the Volvo Environment Prize Foundation, with Muhammad Yunus, the social entrepreneur from Bangladesh.[43]/nGadgil received the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian award from the Government of India in 2006[6] and the H. K. Firodia award of the H. K. Firodia Foundation reached him a year later, in 2007.[44] The Central University of Orissa honoured him with the degree of Doctor of Science (Honoris Causa) in 2013[25] and The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) recognised the contributions of the Western Ghats Ecology Experts Panel (WGEEP) and its chairman with the Georgescu-Roegen Award in 2014.[45] The University of Southern California awarded him the John and Alice Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement in 2015, which he shared with Jane Lubchenco, a Distinguished Professor of Oregon State University,[24] making him the second Indian, after M.

He was previously involved in leadership roles with NSERC HydroNet [3] and Ocean Tracking Network.[15] In 2013 he delivered a TEDx talk on the future of recreational fishing.[16]  He is a Science Ambassador for Keepemwet Fishing.  Cooke launched the Canadian Centre for Evidence-Based Conservation and Environmental Management in 2014 - an affiliate of the UK-based Collaboration for Environmental Evidence. In 2014 Cooke conceived and launched the \"Legends in Canadian Fisheries Science and Management\" initiative to recognize luminaries in Canadian fisheries through the Canadian Aquatic Resources Section of the American Fisheries Society.As of November 2019, Dr. Cooke has published over 800 peer-reviewed scientific papers./nIn 2005, Cooke received the Award of Excellence from the Fisheries Management Section of the American Fisheries Society (AFS) jointly with Drs. Scott Hinch, Tony Farrell and Mike Healey.[17]  In 2008 he received the FSBI Medal from the Fisheries Society of the British Isles.[18] In 2009 he jointly won the Distinguished Service Award from AFS.[19]  In 2013, he was selected as the J.C.

One area of focus includes reproduction and fitness physiology primarily using centrarchid fish. For example, his research revealed that parental care of centrarchid fishes is energetically[25][26] and physiologically[27] demanding. Often, Cooke uses novel technology, like EMG transmitters[28] and telemetry techniques to understand the behavior of and physiology of free-living animals. Recently he provided a framework for the application of telemetry techniques to enable IUCN Red List ranking.[29]  Cooke uses interdisciplinary approaches (ranging from behaviour to genomics[30]) to study complex conservation and management problems.  In particular, he has conducted basic research in support of applied problems for Pacific salmon in British Columbia.[31] For example, his research has revealed that unsuccessful upriver adult migrants tend to be characterized by advanced reproductive development, disease, and stress, relative to those salmon that reach spawning grounds and reproduce.[32][33] This type of information has been used to influence fisheries policy in Canada [34] including the refinement of a management adjustment models [35] for harvest levels of salmon. Cooke has also been a leader in defining the emerging discipline of \u201cconservation physiology\u201d[36][37] by developing physiological techniques that enable rapid assessment of causes of conservation problems and consequences of conservation actions. He has recently extended these ideas to the field of ecological restoration.[38] Understanding physiology can help conservation biologists provide legislators, courts and conservation managers with the mechanisms underlying conservation problems. Cooke\u2019s research in the domain of fisheries science focuses on sustainable fisheries which includes quantifying the consequences of fishing on fish and fisheries and developing and promoting strategies that reduce stress and increase survival through refinement of catch-and-release fishing practices.[39]  His expertise were used to co-authored the UN FAO technical guidelines for recreational fisheries in 2012.[40] Cooke\u2019s research has illuminated problems in recreational fishing and possible development of effective countermeasures to conserve fisheries and his work has helped to refine management strategies in Canada[41] and the USA.[42]  Cooke has also been involved in efforts to raise the profile of the threats facing freshwater fish[43] and freshwater biodiversity more broadly.[44]  He reflects on his successes and failures in generating management- and policy-relevant science in a reflective essay.[45]", "59422398": "Mysore Ananthamurthy Viswamitra (1932\u20132001) was an Indian molecular biophysicist and crystallographer, known for his pioneering work on the X-ray structural studies of DNA fragments and nucleotide coenzyme molecules.[1] His work is reported to have assisted in the development of the concept of sequence-dependent oligonucleotide conformation.

He headlined five PPV events for WWE in 2010\u2014SummerSlam, Night of Champions, Bragging Rights, Survivor Series, and TLC\u2014three of which saw him unsuccessfully challenge for the WWE Championship. In 2011, he formed The Corre, a short-lived group with former Nexus members Heath Slater and Justin Gabriel as well as Ezekiel Jackson. After they disbanded, he would go on to become a five-time Intercontinental Champion./nIn 2013, Barrett's ring name was amended to Bad News Barrett and he adopted the character of someone who took immense pleasure in delivering bad news. Upon winning the 2015 King of the Ring tournament, his ring name was changed to King Barrett and he began portraying an arrogant royal character. He notably portrayed a villain for his entire WWE career, regardless of the other changes made to his character.[3] He left WWE in 2016 and has not wrestled since, though he has appeared in non-wrestling roles on the international independent circuit, such as a commentator for World of Sport Wrestling and a general manager for Defiant Wrestling under his real name. He returned to WWE as a commentator for NXT in 2020./nBennett made his acting debut in the action film Dead Man Down (2013) and has since starred in action films such as Eliminators (2016), I Am Vengeance (2018), and I Am Vengeance: Retaliation (2020)./nStuart Alexander Bennett[4][5] was born in Penwortham on 10 August 1980.[4][6] His mother was a social worker, while his father was an accountant.[7] He has an older brother who manages a supermarket.[7] He grew up in nearby Preston,[2] then moved to Wales with his family at the age of six.[8][9] Despite spending much of his childhood in Wales and admitting that he does not remember anything about Preston, he does not consider Wales his home and has never lived in one place for more than nine years.[7] He was inspired to become a professional wrestler by his idol Davey Boy Smith, and named the WWF Intercontinental Championship match in the main event of SummerSlam 1992 between Smith and his other childhood hero Bret Hart as his favourite match of all time.[10][11] He earned a degree in marine biology from the University of Liverpool,[8] after which he went to work in a science lab and as a recruitment consultant while training to become a wrestler.[8][9]/nWhile living in Liverpool in his early 20s, Bennett became a champion bare-knuckle boxer who would fight in various locations throughout Europe.[11][12][13][14] He competed in a match in Budapest dubbed \"The Battle of Buda\" by the bare-knuckle underworld, in which he defeated a reputable opponent for a substantial cash prize.[15] Later, while walking through an alleyway in search of a taxi to the airport, he was stabbed with an eight-inch knife by someone who attempted to steal the money; he has refused to discuss certain details for legal reasons, but admitted that he seriously injured his attacker and escaped with the money despite significant blood loss. The attack left him with a 12-inch scar that stretches from his upper back to halfway down his right arm,[15] and the punches he took during his bare-knuckle career left him with a disfigured nose,[11] but he has expressed no regret over that period of his life.[15] He incorporated his bare-knuckle career into his WWE gimmick at the request of Dusty Rhodes,[11] being introduced to the WWE audience as a bare-knuckle champion who had fought on the streets of Europe.[16] His Wasteland move is named after the site of many of his fights.[13]/nBennett decided to become a professional wrestler at the age of 21,[11] and was trained by Jon Ritchie and Al Snow.[4] He made his professional wrestling debut in June 2004,[4] using the ring name Stu Sanders,[17] as a surprise entrant in a 30-man battle royal held by NWA UK Hammerlock Wrestling.[6] Sanders also performed at numerous Dropkixx Wrestling, Real Quality Wrestling and All Star Wrestling events,[6][8] as well as wrestling in Wales for Welsh Wrestling.

Cena in particular was heavily targeted by the rookies, who hit him with their finishing moves.[28] On 14 June 2010 edition of Raw, Barrett and the other rookies (minus Daniel Bryan) demanded full-time contracts from Raw General Manager Bret Hart, who instead fired Barrett and had the rookies removed from the building. Later in the show, the rookies attacked Hart and gave him until the Fatal 4-Way pay-per-view to decide on their contracts.[29] At Fatal 4-Way, the rookies interfered in the main event for the WWE Championship, costing Cena the match and the championship in the process to Sheamus.[30] The following night on Raw, Vince McMahon fired Hart and announced that a new 'anonymous' General Manager had been hired and the six rookies received WWE contracts (Barrett's contract was reinstated after he was originally fired the previous week). The group of rookies continued their path of disrupting main events, as they attacked both Cena and McMahon, who had been acting as the referee on 21 June 2010 edition of Raw.[31] On 5 July 2010 edition of Raw, the group was named The Nexus.[32] That same week, Barrett was absent from Raw as his work visa had expired and he had to return to the United Kingdom to apply for a new one.[33] With his visa situation cleared up, Barrett returned the following week.[34]/nOn 12 July 2010 edition of Raw, the Nexus (who were without Darren Young due to being injured in an attack by Cena the previous week) competed in their first match together and defeated Cena in a 6\u2013on\u20131 handicap match after Gabriel hit Cena with the 450\u00b0 splash.[35] The following week, Barrett made his singles match debut on Raw by defeating Mark Henry.[36] The Nexus continued to feud with Cena and the Raw roster, resulting in a seven-on-seven elimination tag team match at SummerSlam. Barrett was the final member of the Nexus but submitted to Cena, causing the Nexus to lose the match.[37] After Young was exiled from the group for losing a match to Cena the night after SummerSlam and Skip Sheffield was injured at a live event in Hawaii two nights later, the Nexus faced Cena, Edge, Randy Orton, Sheamus and Jericho in a five-on-five elimination match on 30 August 2010 edition of Raw, which Barrett won by pinning Orton.[38]/nBarrett received his guaranteed championship match from winning NXT at Night of Champions, where he was unsuccessful in a six-pack challenge match for the WWE Championship, despite eliminating Cena.[39] The feud between Cena and the Nexus continued at Hell in a Cell on 3 October, when Barrett defeated Cena to force Cena to become a member of the Nexus.[40] The following night on Raw, Barrett, with the help of the rest of the Nexus, won a battle royal to determine the number one contender to the WWE Championship, when Cena eliminated himself on Barrett's orders.[41] Barrett received his championship match against Randy Orton at the Bragging Rights pay-per-view. After ordering Cena to help him win, Cena interfered in the match causing Barrett to win via disqualification, which meant that Orton retained the championship.[42] The following night, Barrett was granted a rematch at the Survivor Series pay-per-view, and allowed to choose a guest referee. He chose Cena, stating that if Barrett wins the match and the WWE title, Cena would be allowed to leave the Nexus; however if Barrett failed to win the title, Cena would be fired.[43] At Survivor Series, Barrett was unsuccessful in winning the WWE Championship from Orton after Cena pushed him into an RKO by Orton.[44] Cena was fired as per the match stipulation after Survivor Series. Due to Cena's interference, Barrett received a rematch for the championship the following night on Raw, but was attacked by the fired Cena, \"costing\" him the match, leading to The Miz to cash in his Money in the Bank briefcase on Orton.[45] After Cena attacked several members of the Nexus over the next few weeks, they demanded that Barrett re-instate him, or be exiled from the group.[46] On 13 December 2010 edition of Raw, Barrett agreed and rehired Cena[47] on the condition Cena faces Barrett in a Chairs match at the TLC: Tables, Ladders and Chairs pay-per-view, which Cena won.[48]/nBarrett made his first appearance since the TLC pay-per-view on 3 January 2011 edition of Raw, where he confronted CM Punk, who had taken over the leadership of the Nexus in his absence. Punk gave Barrett the opportunity to regain the leadership, stating that if he won a triple threat steel cage match involving Orton and Sheamus to determine the number one contender for The Miz's WWE Championship, Punk would not only give up the leadership, but work for Barrett's Nexus. However, during the match, Punk came down to ringside, attacked Barrett as he was about to win and took off Barrett's Nexus armband, symbolically removing him from the Nexus, resulting in Barrett losing the match.[49] At the television tapings of 10 January 2011 edition of SmackDown the next day, Barrett made his first SmackDown appearance since 1 October, this time by attacking Big Show.[50] The following week, he was joined by Ezekiel Jackson and his former Nexus stablemates Gabriel and Slater, who had left the group the previous Monday.[51][52] They named themselves The Corre.[53] Barrett later qualified for the Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship, but came up short after being the first man eliminated by Big Show.[54]/nAt the television tapings of 25 March 2011 edition of SmackDown, Barrett defeated Kofi Kingston to win the Intercontinental Championship.[55][56][57] At WrestleMania XXVII, The Corre were defeated in an eight-man tag team match by the team of Kingston, Big Show, Kane and Santino Marella.[58] Barrett went on to successfully defend his championship against Kingston on 22 April 2011 edition of SmackDown.[59] On 6 May 2011 edition of SmackDown, Barrett, Gabriel, and Slater attacked Jackson, removing him from the group.[60] On 13 May 2011 edition of SmackDown, Barrett then challenged Jackson to a match for the Intercontinental Championship at the Over the Limit pay-per-view and Jackson accepted. At the event, Gabriel and Slater attacked Jackson during the match, resulting in a disqualification, but Barrett retained the title as a title cannot change hands via disqualification.[61][62] He then defended his Intercontinental title against Jackson again on 3 June 2011 edition of SmackDown. During this match, Jackson threw Barrett out of the ring, resulting in a countout, but once again, Barrett retained the title as a title cannot change hands via countout. Barrett then instructed The Corre to attack Jackson, but abandoned Gabriel and Slater, whom Jackson fended off.[63] The following week, The Corre dissolved after Barrett, fleeing from Jackson, walked out on Gabriel and Slater in a six-man tag team match against Jackson and The Usos, causing them to lose the match.[64] At Capitol Punishment, Barrett lost the Intercontinental Championship to Jackson,[65] and failed to win his rematch for the title on 24 June episode of SmackDown.[66]\nOn 1 July episode of SmackDown, Barrett was announced to be one of the participants for the SmackDown Money in the Bank match at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, facing Heath Slater, Justin Gabriel, Kane, Sin Cara, Daniel Bryan, Cody Rhodes and Sheamus. The match was won by Daniel Bryan,[67] sparking a rivalry between the two. At SummerSlam, Barrett defeated Bryan in a singles match.[68] He then had a short feud with Sheamus, where he lost on three occasions.[69]/nOn the 21 October episode of SmackDown, Barrett dismissed his past allies as a \"legion of parasites\" and claimed that the only person he needed for success was himself. He vowed that the \"Barrett Barrage\" was only just beginning. Barrett followed this announcement by beating Daniel Bryan.[70] The next week, he began a winning streak, defeating John Morrison, Trent Barreta, Sheamus, and Randy Orton in singles competition.[71] In November, he began feuding with Orton, and both were announced as opposing team captains for Survivor Series. Barrett's winning streak was broken on the 14 November episode of Raw, when he was defeated by Orton via disqualification after Team Barrett attacked Orton. Team Barrett defeated Team Orton at Survivor Series, with Barrett and Cody Rhodes being the sole survivors of the match.[72] On the 25 November episode of SmackDown, Barrett competed in a fatal four-way match against Orton, Cody Rhodes, and Daniel Bryan to determine the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship, which Bryan won.[73]/nBarrett continued his feud with Orton by attacking and distracting him during matches.[74] On the 9 December episode of SmackDown, Barrett and Orton were put into two Beat the Clock matches, with the winner choosing the stipulation for their match at TLC: Tables, Ladders and Chairs. Barrett defeated Ezekiel Jackson in 7:53, but Orton beat Dolph Ziggler in 7:51 and chose a Table match.[75] At TLC, Orton defeated Barrett after hitting the RKO in mid-air, with Barrett landing through the table.[76] On the 23 December episode of SmackDown, they brawled backstage, ending when Orton hit Barrett with the RKO onto a car.[77] This led to a Falls Count Anywhere match the next week, where Barrett pushed Orton down a set of stairs before exiting through the door.[78] Orton suffered a herniated disc as a result, taking him off television for a number of weeks.[79] After Orton returned from injury in late January 2012, he eliminated Barrett from the 2012 Royal Rumble match.[80] On the 3 February edition of SmackDown, Orton defeated Barrett in a No Disqualifications match to end the feud.[81]/nAt Elimination Chamber, Barrett failed to capture the World Heavyweight Championship after being eliminated by Santino Marella.[82] The following night on Raw, Barrett suffered a partially dislocated elbow after Big Show threw Dolph Ziggler at him during a battle royal, and was taken off television.[83][84]/nIn August 2012, WWE aired vignettes promoting Barrett's return, showing him fighting at an underground fight club in an attempt to \"reignite the flame\".[85] Now sporting a beard and shorter hair, he made his return on the 7 September episode of SmackDown to defeat Yoshi Tatsu.[86] He then went on a winning streak, defeating wrestlers including Justin Gabriel, Tyson Kidd, and Zack Ryder, among others.[87][88][89][90] His first loss came on 8 October episode of Raw, when he lost a non-title match to World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus via disqualification after Big Show interfered.[91] Barrett suffered his first pinfall loss on 19 October episode

Champion Kofi Kingston before being eliminated by The Miz.[93]/nThe following night on Raw, Barrett defeated Kingston in a non-title match to earn a match for the Intercontinental Championship.[94] Barrett, still number one contender for the Intercontinental Championship, received a shot at the United States Championship on 3 December Raw, against champion Antonio Cesaro, Kofi Kingston, and R-Truth in a fatal four-way match, but was unsuccessful.[95] Barrett failed to win the Intercontinental Championship from Kingston at the TLC pay-per-view.[96]  Two weeks later, on 31 December Raw, Barrett defeated Kingston to win the Intercontinental Championship for the second time in his career.[97] Barrett made his first successful title defence four days later on SmackDown, defeating Kingston in a rematch.[98] Barrett entered the 2013 Royal Rumble match and was eliminated by the debuting Bo Dallas, but Barrett later returned to eliminate Dallas as well.[99] This started a feud between the duo, with Barrett challenging Dallas to a non-title match the next night on Raw, and Dallas pulling off an upset victory.[100] During the month of February, Barrett and Dallas continued to feud with the two attacking each other backstage.[101][102] On 21 March taping of NXT, Wade Barrett defeated Bo Dallas for another successful title defence.[103]/nDuring the WrestleMania 29 pre-show, Barrett lost the Intercontinental Championship to The Miz,[104] however, he would regain the title in a rematch the following night on Raw.[105] On 20 May Raw, Barrett and Fandango were defeated by Chris Jericho and The Miz in a tag team match after Fandango left the match to dance at ringside and Miz submitted Barrett with the figure-four leglock.[106] Barrett then lost an Intercontinental Championship match to The Miz by disqualification, after Fandango interfered, leading to Barrett attacking both Miz and Fandango post-match.[107] On the next episode of Raw, Barrett was defeated by Fandango in a non-title match after The Miz, who was special guest referee, gave Barrett a Skull Crushing Finale.[108] In June, Fandango suffered a legitimate concussion, removing him from the feud between Barrett and Miz.[109][110]/nAt Payback, Barrett lost the Intercontinental Championship to Curtis Axel in a triple threat match, also involving The Miz.[111] Barrett received his rematch for the title on the following episode of SmackDown, but was again defeated by Axel.[112] On 14 July at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, Barrett competed in the World Heavyweight Championship Money in the Bank ladder match, but was unsuccessful as the match was ultimately won by Damien Sandow.[113] Barrett finally ended his long losing streak on 31 July Main Event, when he defeated R-Truth.[114] On 5 August Raw, Barrett was to shave Daniel Bryan's beard at the orders of Vince McMahon as part of Bryan's \"corporate makeover\", but Bryan attacked and shaved Barrett instead.[115] That same week on SmackDown, Barrett lost to Bryan,[116] but on the next Raw, Barrett defeated Bryan after special guest referee Brad Maddox made a fast count on Bryan.[117] Four days later on SmackDown, Barrett was again defeated by Bryan in a no disqualification match.[118]/nAfter an absence from WWE television due to legitimate work visa issues,[119] he returned on 2 December 2013 episode of Raw as Bad News Barrett, a persona he had previously assumed on The JBL and Cole Show, but was still called Wade on occasion by commentators and backstage interviewers.[120]/nBarrett made his in-ring return on 7 April 2014 Raw, defeating Rey Mysterio in Mysterio's last WWE appearance until 2018. On 14 April episode of Raw, Barrett defeated Dolph Ziggler in round one of the #1 Contender's Tournament for an Intercontinental Championship match at Extreme Rules and on 21 April Raw, Barrett defeated Sheamus to advance to the finals of the tournament. He defeated Rob Van Dam on 28 April Raw in the final round of the tournament, earning a match at Extreme Rules for the Intercontinental Championship against Big E. At Extreme Rules, he became the Intercontinental Champion for the fourth time in his career when he defeated Big E. He then defeated Van Dam at Payback to retain his Intercontinental Championship. On 9 June Raw, he competed in a WWE World Heavyweight Championship qualifying match for the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, but failed after a Brogue Kick by Sheamus. However, Triple H put him in the Money in the Bank ladder match for a WWE World Heavyweight Championship contract on 23 June Raw. The following night at the SmackDown tapings, Barrett separated his shoulder after he was thrown into the barricade by Jack Swagger, so he was pulled from the pay-per-view.[121] Barrett's injury required surgery, ruling him out for months, thus WWE made the move to vacate the Intercontinental Championship on 30 June.[122]/n\"...

Ambrose then stole the Intercontinental title,[127] but he would not be the only one to do so for the following weeks, as various wrestlers gained possession of Barrett's title belt, including R-Truth, Luke Harper, Dolph Ziggler, Daniel Bryan, and Stardust.[128] Of these people, Barrett was pinned in non-title matches against R-Truth, Ziggler, Bryan, and Ambrose within a month before and after Fastlane.[129] Thus, a ladder match for the Intercontinental Title was made for WrestleMania 31, with Barrett defending against Ambrose, Harper, R-Truth, Ziggler, Stardust, and Bryan, who ultimately won the match.[130] Barrett was scheduled to face Bryan for the championship in a rematch at Extreme Rules, however Bryan was not medically cleared to compete. Barrett instead faced Neville in a losing effort on the pre-show.[131]/nOn 28 April 2015 episode of Raw, Barrett would compete in the 2015 King of the Ring tournament, where he defeated Dolph Ziggler in the first round.[132] The following night on the WWE Network, Barrett would defeat R-Truth in the semi-finals before defeating fellow Englishman Neville in the final to become the twentieth winner of the tournament. Under the moniker King Barrett, he would go on to deliberately get himself counted-out to Neville at Payback. King Barrett participated in the Elimination Chamber match for the vacant Intercontinental Championship, but was the first eliminated by R-Truth. At the Money in the Bank pre-show, Barrett lost to Truth. After his victory, Truth began referring to himself as \"King What's Up\" and wore a cape and crown to mock Barrett. The feud culminated in a match at Battleground, which saw Barrett defeat Truth./nBarrett then formed a partnership named \"The Lords of Darkness\" with Stardust,[133] leading to a tag team match at SummerSlam, where they were defeated by Neville and actor Stephen Amell, when Neville pinned Barrett for the win.[134] The night after SummerSlam, Stardust turned on Barrett for costing him the match, thus disbanding their tag team.[133] After a short hiatus, Barrett returned on 28 September episode of Raw, attacking Neville and Stardust./nOn 5 October episode of Raw, Barrett helped Sheamus defeat Neville, after Barrett, who was on commentary during the match, distracted Neville long enough for Sheamus to take advantage. Barrett and Sheamus would then form a tag team, defeating Neville and Cesaro in tag team matches on both Raw and SmackDown. At Survivor Series, Barrett took part in a 5-on-5 traditional Survivor Series elimination tag team match, alongside Sheamus and The New Day, with this team being defeated by Ryback, The Usos and The Lucha Dragons. The following night on Raw, Barrett would help Rusev and Sheamus against Roman Reigns. On 9 November in Manchester, footballer Wayne Rooney slapped Barrett after Barrett talked trash to him repeatedly.[135]/nOn 30 November episode of Raw, after interfering in Sheamus' WWE World Heavyweight Championship title defence against Reigns, Sheamus announced the formation of The League of Nations stable alongside Barrett, Rusev and Alberto Del Rio. On 14 January episode of Smackdown, Barrett helped Del Rio to win United States Championship./nOn 7 March 2016 episode of Raw, Barrett, along with Sheamus and Rusev, competed against Dolph Ziggler in a 3-on-1 handicap elimination match, where Barrett was the only member of his team to be eliminated. At Roadblock, Barrett and Sheamus unsuccessfully challenged The New Day for the WWE Tag Team Championship. On 14 March edition of Raw, Barrett and the entire League of Nations attacked the New Day, after Alberto Del Rio lost to Big E and Xavier Woods in a Tag Team title match. After the attack, Sheamus issued a challenge to The New Day for a six-man tag team match at WrestleMania 32. On 17 March episode of Smackdown, Barrett suffered a loss against Kofi Kingston. At WrestleMania, Barrett's stablemates defeated The New Day after interference from Barrett himself.[136] On 4 April episode of Raw, Barrett and Sheamus challenged the New Day for the tag titles, but lost. After the match, the League of Nations blamed Barrett for being the \"weak link\" and attacked him, ejecting him from the group.[137] This was his last appearance for WWE.[138]/nOn 6 May, WWE announced that Bennett had been released.[139] Following his release, Bennett stated that he chose not to sign a new contract with WWE in August 2015, his contract was scheduled to end in June 2016, but WWE had agreed to an early release from his contract. He asked for his release because he was burnt out creatively and was sick of the crazy schedule of the WWE.[140] Bennett then took a hiatus from wrestling altogether in order to focus on his acting career, but said he would return to wrestling when he felt the time was right.[141]/nAfter leaving WWE, Bennett would work in non-wrestling roles. He spent 2017 making appearances in WhatCulture Pro Wrestling (WCPW), which later became Defiant Wrestling, where he served as on-screen general manager.[142] The following year, he joined World of Sport Wrestling (WOS) as an on-screen executive and commentator.[143]/nBennett appeared on Lucha Underground for its season four finale on 8 November 2018,[144] marking his first and only appearance as Lucha Underground closed soon after.[145] In December 2019, he provided colour commentary for the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) during their Into the Fire PPV as well as NWA Power tapings.[citation needed]/nOn 26 August 2020 episode of NXT, which had become WWE's third major brand while he was gone, Bennett returned to WWE under his earlier Wade Barrett name to serve as a colour commentator in a single-appearance deal.

He was reported to have contributed to the FAO sponsored Indo-Japonica Hybridization programme[1] which yielded the nitrogen responsive rice varieties of Mahsuri, Malinja, ADT 27 and Circna, the first two released in Malaysia, the third in India and the last one, in Australia.[5] He also evolved a number of varieties of rice which include GEB 24, ADT 3, CO 4 and CO 25.[6] The GEB 24 variety is a progenitor for 83 rice varieties developed across countries.[7]/nRamiah was one of the first scientists who advocated for standardisation of gene symbols for rice.[2] Serving as the FAO expert based in Bangkok, he was involved with the rice breeding in many countries.[1][2] He was known to have conducted advanced research on X-ray induced mutation of rice[2] and established a gene bank for rice.[8] He was the author of two books on the subject, Rice in Madras[9] and Rice Breeding and Genetics.[10]/nThe British government appointed Ramiah a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1938 Birthday Honours list.[11] After India's independence, the Government of India recognised his services by awarding him the fourth-highest civilian honour of Padma Shri in 1957 and the third-highest honour of the Padma Bhushan in 1970.[3][12] The Centre for Environmental Science and Engineering of the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay has instituted Ramiah Memorial Lecture, an annual lecture event, in his honour.[13] He died on 3 August 1988, survived by his five sons and two daughters and their families; his wife had predeceased him.[1]", "66107087": "Jan Hamber (n\u00e9e Armstrong) is an American ornithologist and conservationist. While working at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History in the 1970s, she became involved in the effort to save the California condor, and has been credited with playing a major role in the condor's survival in the wild. Hamber was the biologist who tracked the last known California condor in the wild, placing the phone call that led to its capture at the beginning of the successful captive breeding program that saved condors from becoming extinct./nJan Armstrong was born in New Jersey[1] and grew up in New York City, where her father taught agriculture at a high school.[2] She developed an early interest in birding.[2] Hamber attended Cornell University, where she took a class in ornithology taught by Professor Arthur Allen, and went on to major in botany.[1] While at Cornell she met and married Hank Hamber, and the two lived in Connecticut, Florida, and Alaska before moving to California in 1957 and settling in Santa Barbara in 1959.[2][3]/nWhile living in California, Hamber was one of the founders of the Santa Barbara chapter of the Audubon Society.[4] She began volunteering at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History in 1959, where by the end of the 1960s she had worked as associate curator of vertebrate zoology[3] and curator of ornithology mammalogy.[2] As a curator at the museum, Hamber was prevented from doing field research with the rest of the science team on one of California's Channel Islands, because the owner of the site would not allow a woman to work as a researcher there.[1] In 1976, Hamber accompanied the naturalist Dick Smith on a U.S. Forest Service expedition to study a pair of California condors that he had found nesting in the San Rafael Wilderness, and she continued to study condors in following seasons.[1] After Smith died in 1977, Hamber and her husband continued tracking the condors.[2] By 1980, the California condor had become critically endangered, and in the wake of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 the condor had become the focus of one of the American government's highest-priority conservation efforts.[1] Hamber was assigned to monitor the nesting pair of condors that Smith had discovered several years previously.[1] John Moir, writing for Audubon, credited Hamber with the discovery that it is possible for Condors to nest in successive years, calling this \"a finding with significant implications for rebuilding the population\".[1]/nIn 1987, Hamber was tasked with tracking the last wild California condor (one of only 27 condors then alive, with the other 26 in captivity in California zoos).[1] Captive breeding could not yet be attempted because the only male condor bred in captivity was at Los Angeles Zoo, but there were no female condors that it could mate with.[2] As the person tracking the only living wild condor, Hamber initiated its capture, so that zoos could attempt to restore the species through a captive breeding program.[1] With no condors left in the wild to monitor, Hamber established the Condor Archives at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, translating decades of field notes about California condors into a searchable database.[1] That database turned into the most comprehensive database about condors.[5] As the condor captive breeding program began to work and more condors were born and released into the wild, Hamber again became involved in efforts to monitor them,[1] something she continued volunteering to do as the wild population of condors grew over the following decades.[6] The capture and release efforts proved to be effective, and by 2019 there were about 500 California condors in the world (split roughly equally between wild and captive birds[2]).[1]/nHamber was one of the biologists featured in the 2013 documentary The Condor's Shadow.[7] A timeline of her work was exhibited by the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History in 2020.[8] In 2012, Hamber was named a Local Hero by the Santa Barbara Independent.[9] In 2017, Hamber was awarded the Trailblazing Women in Science Award from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, in recognition of her work on California condor conservation.[10] Hamber also won the 2017 Wilderness Spirit Award from the Wildling Museum of Art & Nature.[11]", "7878360": "Michael T.

In some fish species, he reasoned, males can maximize their reproductive success by breeding with a harem of females rather than breeding only once as a female.  In other species, where the fish live in pairs, it is to an individual's advantage to be male when small and to turn into a female when it is larger.[7]/nGhiselin has also worked on the history and philosophy of evolutionary biology. His historical publications have dealt mainly with Darwin and the history of comparative zoology. They include such topics as the influence of alchemy on nineteenth century zoology and the history of the Zoological Station at Naples, Italy. His thought on Darwin's view of selection, whether to the individual or to the group, and sometimes apparently kin selectionist, has been criticised as inconsistent by Helena Cronin.[8]/nHe has criticised the falsification of the history of Lamarck's theory of evolution, where in his view schoolbooks and \"textbook-writers have imbued the fictitious Lamarck with an importance that the real Lamarck never had, and they have credited him with ideas that the real Lamarck did not hold. They also have invented a myth in which those ideas are compared falsely with Darwin's ideas, to produce a bogus dichotomy.\"[9] He has also criticized the views of creationists as non-scientific.[10]/nHis main contribution to philosophy concerns the principles of classification (systematics or taxonomy). He is given much of the credit for first theorizing that biological species are not kinds of organisms, but are rather individuals in a philosophical sense (in the manner that an individual population is an individual entity, rather than an abstract type).[11] A human being is not a Homo sapiens for the same reason that Ontario is not a Canada.[12] Ghiselin was also the originator of the term \"chunks of the genealogical nexus\" to describe species.[13]/nGhiselin has many interdisciplinary interests, among which is forging links between biology and economics. He is Vice President of the International Society for Bioeconomics, and has served as the Co-Editor of the Journal of Bioeconomics since it was established in 1998.

It led to a collaboration with The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) to sequence the entire genome of the organism in 1995.  In 1996 Hutchison spent a sabbatical year at TIGR; there he discussed with Hamilton Smith and Craig Venter the idea of a minimum cell - cell with the minimal set of genes required for survival.[8]  They speculated that they may need to synthesize the genome to test them in recipient cell, thereby creating a synthetic cell./nIn 2003 Hutchison began a collaboration with Hamilton Smith on the assembly of a synthetic minimal cellular genome, and successfully synthesized the small genome (5386 base pairs) of the bacteriophage \u03a6X174.  The M. genitalium genome however is over 100 times larger than that of \u03a6X174.  In 2007, a chemically synthesized genome of 582,970 base pairs based on M. genitalium, intended for the creation of an organism christened Mycoplasma laboratorium, was successfully assembled.[9] M. genitalium however is slow-growing and attempts at transplanting its genome to another species became protracted and proved unsuccessful.  The synthetic-cell team however showed that it is possible to transplant the natural genome of Mycoplasma mycoides, whose genome is twice the size of  M. genitalium, into a related species Mycoplasma capricolum.[10]  The team therefore decided to switch to the faster-growing M. mycoides as the donor species. In March 2010, a synthesized M. mycoides genome was successfully transplanted into M. capricolum.[8][11]  The resulting organism was called \"Synthia\" by the popular press.[8]  In 2016, the team revealed a further pared-down version of the organism with 473 genes, 149 of which whose functions are completely unknown.[12]/nWork on creating the minimal cell is currently in progress.  New versions of the synthetic genome with genes removed are transplanted into recipient cells, and the resultant cells' growth rates and their colony size are monitored.  Other more complex bacteria such as cyanobacteria are also being assessed for the feasibility of genome transplantation.[8]", "60634851": "Callum James Bell is a biologist.

She is an Academy of Finland professor at the University of Turku.[1] Her research interests include ageing, lifespan, and natural selection in contemporary human populations.[1] In addition to her research into human evolution, Lummaa studies life history patterns, social behavior, and more in Asian elephants, another large, long-lived mammal.[2]  Lummaa is currently the Principal Investigator of both the Human Life History Group based at the University of Turku and the Myanmar Timber Elephant Project.[2][3] She has received a starting grant from the European Research Council.[1]/nLummaa's research into the life history and evolution of contemporary humans has been widely covered by the press. Her work is largely based on a collection of digitized Finnish parish records which provide longitudinal demographic data spanning 350 years and 15 generations.[3] Lummaa has used these data to investigate a variety of topics related to human survival, reproduction, and evolution in contemporary human populations. She has tested the popular \"grandmother hypothesis\" by evaluating the impact of a grandmother's presence on infant survival rates.[4][5][6] Overall, her data support the claim that grandmothers can improve infant survival, but noted that there were exceptions. For example, simultaneous child bearing and raising by daughters-in-law and mothers-in-law actually decreased child survival rate.[7] Lummaa has also studied the grandmother hypothesis in Asian elephants. In addition to testing the grandmother hypothesis, Lummaa has used this dataset to evaluate the impact of having a male twin on females. She found that females with a twin brother had reduced fertility, suggesting a prenatal effect on females with a twin brother.[8] Lummaa has also studied the impact of stressful periods upon miscarriage rates. Interestingly, male fetuses were more likely to be miscarried during difficult times than female fetuses. This resulted in a skewed sex ratio in the population.[9]  Furthermore, Lummaa has used this dataset to investigate evolution in contemporary human populations.[10][11]/nThrough the Myanmar Timber Elephant Project, Lummaa studies similar topics including health, survival and reproduction in Asian elephants. Lummaa argues that despite their appearance, the fact that elephants share long life spans, reproductive history, and family structure with humans makes them useful animals to study.[12] She hopes that studying elephants can help scientists better understand ageing in humans.[12] This work is based on a century's work of longitudinal demographic data as well as new data collected from live elephants.[2] These robust datasets exist because captive elephants undergo rigorous health tests throughout their lives to ensure they are fit to work, thereby producing helpful datasets for scientists like Lummaa.[12] Like her work on humans, Lummaa's research into Asian elephants has been covered in the press. Lummaa has found evidence that elephant grandmothers help care for calves in a role similar to that of human grandmothers.[1] Additionally, the presence of a maternal sister  improves chance of calf survival.[13] Furthermore, her work has revealed that calves born to stressed mothers during harsh weather actually age faster than other calves.[12] While the exact cause is unclear, Lummaa hopes findings like these can be applied to understand ageing in humans.[12] In addition to the basic science aim of understanding life history of large, long-lived mammals such as humans and elephants, the Myanmar Timber Elephant Project hopes their research can guide elephant management and healthcare to improve the lives of captive and wild endangered elephants.[2]  Her research demonstrates that wild populations of Asian elephants are vulnerable to decline.[14]  She has expressed concern about captive elephant populations used in the timber industry and in tourism. Additionally, she is concerned about the impact these industries have on the wild populations from which the captive population is drawn.[14][15]", "39630574": "Dr. Kim Sunghoon is a South Korean biologist./nDr. Sunghoon Kim has been studying novel functions of human aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases(ARSs) and searching for their pathophysiological connections to human diseases(PNAS 105:11043,[1] 2008; Nat Rev Cancer 11:708, 2011[2]).

He developed the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) as a model organism for biological research in his early career, attacked the eugenics movement in the middle of his career, and wrote popular books on science, mathematics and language in his later career.[2][3][4][5][6][7][8]/nHogben was born and raised in Southsea near Portsmouth in Hampshire. His parents were Methodists.[1] He attended Tottenham County School in London, his family having moved to Stoke Newington, where his mother had grown up, in 1907, and then as a medical student studied physiology at Trinity College, Cambridge.[3] Hogben had matriculated into the University of London as an external student before he could apply to Cambridge and he graduated as a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in 1914.[9] He took his Cambridge degree in 1915, graduating with an Ordinary BA. He had acquired socialist convictions, changing the name of the university's Fabian Society to Socialist Society and went on to become an active member of the Independent Labour Party. Later in life he preferred to describe himself as 'a scientific humanist'.[10]/nIn the First World War he was a pacifist, and joined the Quakers.[1] He worked for six months with the Red Cross in France, under the auspices of the Friends' War Victims Relief Service and then the Friends' Ambulance Unit. He then returned to Cambridge, and was imprisoned in Wormwood Scrubs as a conscientious objector in 1916. His health collapsed and he was released in 1917.[1] His brother George was also a conscientious objector, serving with the Friends' Ambulance Unit./nAfter a year's convalescence he took lecturing positions in London universities and in 1921 he became a Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) in Zoology of the University of London.[11] He moved in 1922 to the University of Edinburgh and its Animal Breeding Research Department.In 1923, Hogben was a founder of the Society for Experimental Biology and its organ the British Journal of Experimental Biology (renamed Journal of Experimental Biology in 1930), along with Julian Huxley and geneticist Francis Albert Eley Crew (1886\u20131973). According to Gary Werskey, Hogben was the only one of the founders not holding any eugenic ideas. In 1923 he was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were James Hartley Ashworth, James Cossar Ewart, Francis Albert Eley Crew and John Stephenson. He won the Society's Keith Prize for the period 1933\u201335.[12] He then went to McGill University./nIn 1927 he became zoology chair at the University of Cape Town. He worked in endocrinology, studying chameleon properties of the Xenopus frog. The frog's adult color depended on its early environment; wild frogs became brownish-green, while frogs raised in a dark environment became black, and in a light environment, light-colored. Hogben theorized that the frog's ability to develop differences in color was related to the pituitary gland. After removing the pituitary gland, the frogs became white regardless of their environment.[13]/nThe frogs also developed a side effect that Hogben tried to counteract by injecting the frogs with pituitary extract from an ox. He noticed that female Xenopus frogs ovulated within hours of being injected with the extract.  In this way, Hogben serendipitously discovered a human pregnancy test.  He knew that the ox extract chemically resembled human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), a hormone released by pregnant women.  He confirmed that female Xenopus frogs, when injected with urine from a pregnant woman, ovulated within hours.[13] Hogben found the job in South Africa attractive, but his antipathy to the country's racial policies drove him to leave./nIn 1930 Hogben moved to the London School of Economics, in a chair for social biology. There he continued to develop the Hogben Pregnancy Test. Previous pregnancy tests required several days to carry out and resulted in the deaths of mice or rabbits. Hogben's pregnancy test took hours and could be carried out without harm to the frogs, which could be reused for future tests. It became the major, international pregnancy test for about fifteen years, from the mid-1930s through the 1940s.[14]/nThe social biology position at the London School of Economics was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, and when it withdrew funding Hogben moved to Aberdeen, becoming Regius Professor of Natural History at the University of Aberdeen in 1937./nDuring World War II Hogben had responsibility for the British Army's medical statistics. From 1941\u20131947 he was Mason Professor of Zoology at the University of Birmingham and professor of medical statistics there 1947\u20131961, when he retired. \nIn 1963, he became the first Vice-Chancellor of the University of Guyana, a post he abandoned in April 1964, resigning in 1965./nHogben's claim to have discovered the Xenopus pregnancy test was disputed by two South African researchers, Hillel Shapiro and Harry Zwarenstein. Shapiro had been Hogben's student in Cape Town, and he acknowledged that Hogben had suggested that Xenopus was a suitable subject for general research. The pregnancy test itself was discovered by Shapiro and his co-researcher, Harry Zwarenstein, and their results and report had been widely published in medical journals and text books[15] in South Africa[16] and the United Kingdom; in their report published by Royal Society of South Africa in October 1933, Shapiro and Zwarenstein announced that in the previous month they had successfully used Xenopus in 35 pregnancy tests. The following spring Nature carried their report.[17] Shapiro and Zwarenstein's letter published in the British Medical Journal on 16 November 1946[18] clarified that Hogben was retrospectively wrongly claiming credit for discovering the pregnancy test. Nobel laureate John B. Gurdon of the Wellcome CRC Institute and Nick Hopwood of the Department of History and Philosophy of Science, University of Cambridge, elaborated on this in detail in their comprehensive article published in The International Journal of Developmental Biology, pointing out that although Hogben had demonstrated in principle that Xenopus might be used for testing the presence of gonadotrophins in a pregnant woman's urine, his reporting had not mentioned pregnancy testing at all; he seemed to have had other research directions.[19]/nWhile he was[when?] Chair for Social Biology at the London School of Economics, Hogben unleashed a relentless attack on the British eugenics movement, which was at its apex in the 1920s and 1930s. In contrast to eugenicists, who commonly drew a strict line between heredity (or nature) and environment (or nurture), Hogben highlighted the 'interdependence of nature and nurture'.[10] Hogben's appeal to this interdependence of nature and nurture marked the first time gene-environment interaction (or 'gene-environment interplay') was used to undermine statistical attempts to partition the contributions of nature and nurture, as well as the eugenic implications drawn from those statistics. Hogben's foil throughout this period was R.A. Fisher, the leading scientist-eugenicist of the day (Tabery 2008)./nIn an interview for the book Twentieth Century Authors, Hogben stated:/n\"I like Scandinavians, skiing, swimming and socialists who realize it is our business to promote social progress by peaceful methods. I dislike football, economists, eugenicists, Fascists, Stalinists, and Scottish conservatives. I think that sex is necessary and bankers are not\".[10]/nInspired by the example of  The Outline of History by H. G. Wells,  Hogben began to work on books designed to popularize mathematics and science for the general public. Hogben produced two best-selling works of popular science, Mathematics for the Million (1936) and Science for the Citizen (1938). Mathematics for the Million received widespread praise, with H. G. Wells saying that \"Mathematics for the Million is a great book, a book of first-class importance\".[20] The book was also lauded by Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell and Julian Huxley.[20][21]Mathematics for the Million was reprinted after Hogben's death.[21] While at Aberdeen, Hogben developed an interest in language. Besides editing The Loom of Language by his friend Frederick Bodmer, he created an international language, Interglossa, as 'a draft of an auxiliary for a democratic world order'./nGeorge Orwell in his essay Politics and the English Language[22] used a sentence of Hogben's as an example of how not to write, particularly in relation to the use of metaphors./nAbove all, we cannot play ducks and drakes with a native battery of idioms which prescribes egregious collocations of vocables (...)/nProfessor Hogben plays ducks and drakes with a battery which is able to write prescriptions (...)/nIn 1918 Hogben married the mathematician, statistician, socialist and feminist Enid Charles from Denbigh with whom he had two sons and two daughters.[3] He learned Welsh and they had four children.[23]/nIn the 1950s Hogben settled at Glyn Ceiriog in north Wales, where he bought a cottage. That decade his marriage to Enid broke down; the couple separated in 1953 and divorced in 1957. Later that year Hogben married (Mary) Jane Roberts (n\u00e9e Evans), a local widowed retired school headmistress, who was seven years younger. Widowed by the death of Jane in 1974, he died at the War Memorial Hospital at Wrexham[3] in 1975 aged 79 and was cremated at nearby Pentre Bychan.[24] He was an atheist, and defined himself as a \"scientific humanist\".[25][26]/nHogben was awarded the Neill Prize, and a gold medal, for his work in mathematical genetics.[27]\nIn 1936, Hogben became a Fellow of the Royal Society.[28] The citation read:/nDistinguished for his work in Experimental Zoology, especially in respect of the mechanism of colour change in Amphibia and Reptilia. He has published a series of important papers on the effect of hormones on the pigmentary effector system and on the reproductive cycle of vertebrates, and has worked on many branches of comparative physiology. More recently he has made substantial contributions to genetics, especially with regard to man./nHogben's research has left a lasting impression on the history of biology. The African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis), which Hogben first developed as a model organism, is now one of the most widely used model organisms in biological research. Likewise, his emphasis on the interdependence of nature and nurture has affected and continues to affect scientific practice and scientific debate. In terms of scientific practice, modern research on phenotypic plasticity, gene-environment interaction, and developmental systems theory all owes much to the legacy of Hogben's initial emphasis on understanding nature and nurture interdependently rather than in dichotomy. In terms of scientific debate, the dispute between Hogben and R.A. Fisher over gene-environment interaction was the first of many subsequent disputes over the extent to which the primacy of the gene can be understood independently of its developmental relationship with the environment.[29] The debate on nature and nurture, the race and intelligence controversy, the heritability wars, concerns over the geneticisation of complex human traits, and arguments over the promises and perils of the human genome project all incorporate some element of disagreement over the primacy of the gene. Hogben's attack on that primacy by appeal to the interdependence of nature and nurture has been echoed in each successive dispute./nThe Lancelot Thomas Hogben papers are held in Special Collections Archived 28 August 2009 at the Wayback Machine, University of Birmingham.

Fellow German Ernst Mayr ranked him as the second most notable evolutionary theorist of the 19th century, after Charles Darwin. Weismann became the Director of the Zoological Institute and the first Professor of Zoology at Freiburg./nHis main contribution involved germ plasm theory, at one time also known as Weismannism,[1] according to which inheritance (in a multicellular animal) only takes place by means of the germ cells\u2014the gametes such as egg cells and sperm cells. Other cells of the body\u2014somatic cells\u2014do not function as agents of heredity. The effect is one-way: germ cells produce somatic cells and are not affected by anything the somatic cells learn or therefore any ability an individual acquires during its life. Genetic information cannot pass from soma to germ plasm and on to the next generation. Biologists refer to this concept as the Weismann barrier.[2] This idea, if true, rules out the inheritance of acquired characteristics as proposed by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck.[3] However, a careful reading of Weismann's work over the span of his entire career shows that he had more nuanced views, insisting, like Darwin, that a variable environment was necessary to cause variation in the hereditary material.[4]/nThe idea of the Weismann barrier is central to the modern synthesis of the early 20th century, though scholars do not express it today in the same terms. In Weismann's opinion the largely random process of mutation, which must occur in the gametes (or stem cells that make them) is the only source of change for natural selection to work on. Weismann became one of the first biologists to deny Lamarckism entirely.[5] Weismann's ideas preceded the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's work, and though Weismann was cagey about accepting Mendelism, younger workers soon made the connection./nWeismann is much admired today. Ernst Mayr judged him to be the most important evolutionary thinker between Darwin and the evolutionary synthesis around 1930\u20131940, and \"one of the great biologists of all time\".[6]/nWeismann was born a son of high school teacher Johann (Jean) Konrad Weismann (1804\u20131880), a graduate of ancient languages and theology, and his wife Elise (1803\u20131850), n\u00e9e L\u00fcbbren, the daughter of the county councillor and mayor of Stade, on 17 January 1834 in Frankfurt am Main. He had a typical 19th century bourgeois education, receiving music lessons from the age of four, and drafting and painting lessons from Jakob Becker (1810\u20131872) at the Frankfurter St\u00e4delsche Institut from the age of 14. His piano teacher was a devoted butterfly collector and introduced him to the collecting of imagos and caterpillars. But studying natural sciences was out of the question due to the cost involved and limited job prospects. A friend of the family, chemist Friedrich W\u00f6hler (1800\u20131882), recommended studying medicine. A foundation from the inheritance of Weismann's mother allowed him to take up studies in G\u00f6ttingen. Following his graduation in 1856, he wrote his dissertation on the synthesis of hippuric acid in the human body./nImmediately after university, Weismann took on a post as assistant at the St\u00e4dtische Klinik (city clinic) in Rostock. Weismann successfully submitted two manuscripts, one about hippuric acid in herbivores, and one about the salt content of the Baltic Sea, and won two prizes. The paper about the salt content dissuaded him from becoming a chemist, since he felt himself lacking in apothecarial accuracy./nAfter a study visit to see Vienna's museums and clinics, he visited Italy (1859) and Paris (1860). He returned to Frankfurt as personal physician to the banished Archduke Stephen of Austria at Schaumburg Castle from 1861 to 1863.[7]  During the war between Austria, France and Italy in 1859, he became Chief Medical Officer in the military, and on a leave from duty he walked through Northern Italy and the County of Tyrol. After a sabbatical in Paris, he worked with Rudolf Leuckart at the University of Gie\u00dfen. He graduated as a physician and settled in Frankfurt with a medical practice in 1868.[citation needed]/nFrom 1863, he was privatdozent in comparative anatomy and zoology; from 1866 extraordinary professor; and from 1873 to 1912 full professor, first holder of the chair in zoology and director of the zoological institute at Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg in Breisgau. He retired in 1912.[8] His earlier work was largely concerned with purely zoological investigations, one of his earliest works dealing with the development of the Diptera. Microscopical work, however, became impossible to him owing to impaired eyesight, and he turned his attention to wider problems of biological inquiry.[7]/nIn 1867 he married Mary Dorothea Gruber./nTheir son, Julius Weismann (1879\u20131950), was a composer./nAt the beginning of Weismann's preoccupation with evolutionary theory was his grappling with Christian creationism as a possible alternative. In his work \u00dcber die Berechtigung der Darwin'schen Theorie (On the justification of the Darwinian theory) he compared creationism and evolutionary theory, and concluded that many biological facts can be seamlessly accommodated within evolutionary theory, but remain puzzling if considered the result of acts of creation./nAfter this work, Weismann accepted evolution as a fact on a par with the fundamental assumptions of astronomy (e.g. Heliocentrism). Weismann's position towards the mechanism of inheritance and its role for evolution changed during his life. Three periods can be distinguished./nWeismann's work on the demarcation between germ-line and soma can scarcely be appreciated without considering the work of (mostly) German biologists during the second half of the 19th century. This was the time that the mechanisms of cell division began to be understood. Eduard Strasburger, Walther Flemming, Heinrich von Waldeyer and the Belgian Edouard Van Beneden laid the basis for the cytology and cytogenetics of the 20th century. Strasburger, the outstanding botanical physiologist of that century, coined the terms nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. He said \"new cell nuclei can only arise from the division of other cell nuclei\". Van Beneden discovered how chromosomes combined at meiosis, during the production of gametes, and discovered and named chromatin. Walther Flemming, the founder of cytogenetics, named mitosis, and pronounced \"omnis nucleus e nucleo\" (which means the same as Strasburger's dictum). The discovery of mitosis, meiosis and chromosomes is regarded as one of the 100 most important scientific discoveries of all times,[9] and one of the 10 most important discoveries in cell biology.[10]/nMeiosis was discovered and described for the first time in sea urchin eggs in 1876, by Oscar Hertwig. It was described again in 1883, at the level of chromosomes, by Van Beneden in Ascaris eggs. The significance of meiosis for reproduction and inheritance, however, was first described in 1890 by Weismann, who noted that two cell divisions were necessary to transform one diploid cell into four haploid cells if the number of chromosomes had to be maintained. Thus the work of the earlier cytologists laid the ground for Weismann, who turned his mind to the consequences for evolution, which was an aspect the cytologists had not addressed.[11] All this took place before the work of Mendel had been rediscovered/nWeismann started out believing, like many other 19th century scientists, among them Charles Darwin, that the observed variability of individuals of one species is due to the inheritance of sports (Darwin's term). He believed, as written in 1876, that transmutation of species is directly due to the influence of environment. He also wrote, \"if every variation is regarded as a reaction of the organism to external conditions, as a deviation of the inherited line of development, it follows that no evolution can occur without a change of the environment\". (This is close to the modern use of the concept that changes in the environment can mediate selective pressures on a population, so leading to evolutionary change.) Weismann also used the classic Lamarckian metaphor of use and disuse of an organ./nWeismann's first rejection of the inheritance of acquired traits was in a lecture in 1883, titled \"On inheritance\" (\"\u00dcber die Vererbung\"). Again, as in his treatise on creation vs. evolution, he attempts to explain individual examples with either theory. For instance, the existence of non-reproductive castes of ants, such as workers and soldiers, cannot be explained by inheritance of acquired characters. Germ plasm theory, on the other hand, does so effortlessly. Weismann used this theory to explain Lamark's original examples for \"use and disuse\", such as the tendency to have degenerate wings and stronger feet in domesticated waterfowl./nWeismann worked on the embryology of sea urchin eggs, and in the course of this observed different kinds of cell division, namely equatorial division and reductional division, terms he coined (\u00c4quatorialteilung and Reduktionsteilung respectively)./nHis germ plasm theory states that multicellular organisms consist of germ cells containing heritable information, and somatic cells that carry out ordinary bodily functions. The germ cells are influenced neither by environmental influences nor by learning or morphological changes that happen during the lifetime of an organism, which information is lost after each generation. The concept as he proposed it was referred to as Weismannism in his day, for example in the book An examination of Weismannism by George Romanes[1] This idea was illuminated and explained by the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's work in the early years of the 20th century (see Mendelian inheritance)./nThe idea that germline cells contain information that passes to each generation unaffected by experience and independent of the somatic (body) cells, came to be referred to as the Weismann barrier, and is frequently quoted as putting a final end to the theory of Lamarck and the inheritance of acquired characteristics. What Lamarck claimed was the inheritance of characteristics acquired through effort, or will./nWeismann conducted the experiment of removing the tails of 68 white mice, repeatedly over 5 generations, and reporting that no mice were born in consequence without a tail or even with a shorter tail. He stated that \"901 young were produced by five generations of artificially mutilated parents, and yet there was not a single example of a rudimentary tail or of any other abnormality in this organ.\"[12] Weismann was aware of the limitations of this experiment, and made it clear that he embarked on the experiment precisely because, at the time, there were many claims of animals inheriting mutilations (he refers to a claim regarding a cat that had lost its tail having numerous tail-less offspring). There were also claims of Jews born without foreskins. None of these claims, he said, were backed up by reliable evidence that the parent had in fact been mutilated, leaving the perfectly plausible possibility that the modified offspring were the result of a mutated gene. The purpose of his experiment was to lay the claims of inherited mutilation to rest. The results were consistent with Weismann's germ plasm theory./nHe was awarded the Linnean Society of London's Darwin-Wallace Medal in 1908.", "44676862": "Virander Singh Chauhan is an Indian scientist[1] and a Rhodes Scholar[2] working in the fields of genetic engineering and biotechnology.

Earlier in his career, Honma made a key discovery that body temperature, locomotor activity, and plasma levels of corticosterone - all circadian processes - are likely coupled to one common internal oscillator in rats.[9] However, his current research is centered around the ontogeny of circadian rhythms[10] as well as understanding and uncovering the physiological aspects that underlie chronobiology./nHonma was the first person to describe \"a Phase response curve (PRC) to a single bright light pulse in human subjects living under isolation.\"[11] Furthermore, he developed a model in animals for a sleep-wake cycle that is desynchronized from other circadian rhythms in the body such as the plasma levels of melatonin - contributing to the current understanding of circadian disorders with implications for the development of appropriate treatments.[11]/nEarlier in their careers, Honma and his wife, Sato Honma, were able to detect circadian rhythms in Bmal1 gene expression via in situ hybridization in the SCN within rats. They found that BMAL1 expression was highest during the subjective night in rats and that rhythms of mRNA expression were found in other regions of the brain like the hippocampus and the cerebellum. These findings allowed them to deduce that Bmal1 plays a significant role in regulating circadian rhythms in rats.[12]/nIn 2014, Honma and colleagues published a paper that highlighted the effects of postnatal light in Cryptochrome (Cry) deficient mice.[13] The authors showed that exposure to constant light can partially restore rhythms in the SCN, even though Cry deficient mice lose sleep-wake rhythms upon weaning,[13] by placing newborn mice in constant light for three weeks after they were born.[13]/nIn 2016, he published an article that emphasized the role of physical activity, specifically in blind and elderly people, in the entrainment of circadian rhythms.[14] The authors demonstrated that physical activity could not only induce phase-shifts in sleep and wake schedules, but that it could also contribute to shifts in plasma levels of melatonin.[14]/nIn 2017, Ken-Ichi and Sato Honma were part of the team at Hokkaido University that discovered that voltage rhythms in the SCN were synchronized, a finding which became a basis for the theory that the SCN utilizes these synchronized rhythms in order to maintain tissue-wide rhythm.[15]/nOne of Honma's most recent discoveries uncovered the role of GABAergic neurons in inhibiting cells in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (the central oscillator in mammals). He concluded, together with his collaborators, that GABA neither establishes nor maintains circadian patterns in the body, but rather that it \"refine[s] the circadian firing rhythm to ensure noiseless communications with neurons outside the SCN.\"[16] This discovery poses implications for the development of new therapies and treatments targeting different circadian-related disorders./nHonma has also been involved with recent research about ultradian rhythms, which are short-term rhythms with short-lasting periods.[17] He has shown that in constant dark conditions, ultradian rhythms can be observed in the SCN, and that expression of Per1, Per2 and Bmal1 - which are central clock genes in mammals - show ultradian fluctuations and periods of approximately 3 hours.[17] The research team also showed that these rhythms are most likely endogenous, or that they do not rely on external cues to be generated. Overall, the team concluded that ultradian rhythms had no correlation with the animal's physical activity rhythms, but that further research is needed to elucidate the role of these fluctuations as well as undercover the mechanisms underlying their generation.[17]/nHonma is one of the leading voices contributing to the anti-daylight savings movement in Japan, advocating against the establishment of daylight-savings time in Japan by educating people on the detrimental health effects associated with the misalignment of the body's clock, light-dark cycles (zeitgebers), and the social clock.

Reinhart's many talents made him appear as a modern Renaissance man. He played the violin, and published an autobiographic novel (Jenseits von Babel\n[4]) and several works of lyric poetry for which he received the Brigitte Reimann Prize.  Among his services to the scientific community, Reinhart was associate editor of PLoS Computational Biology./nReinhart Heinrich was born in Dresden and lived at first in the Soviet Union, growing up in Kuybyshev/\u041a\u0443\u0439\u0431\u044b\u0448\u0435\u0432 (called Samara since 1991) where his father Helmut Heinrich \u2014 a German mathematician turned aircraft constructor \u2014 had been taken after the Second World War to work.[1] Having been educated as a theoretical physicist at Dresden University of Technology in East Germany, Reinhart conducted his postdoctoral research in the early 1970s at the Charit\u00e9's Institute of Biochemistry in East Berlin. He could not fail to notice the absence of mathematical theory from cell biology as compared with other natural sciences. Enzyme kinetics was a notable exception. However, how enzymes affect the flux through a metabolic pathway was still discussed using the rather vague term rate-limiting step. Working with Tom Rapoport on mathematical models of glycolysis in red blood cells, Reinhart discovered a precise and general definition of rate limitation in metabolic pathways, for which he received in 1974 the Humboldt Prize.[1] He extended his knowledge in this area, working over one year in Pushchino with Evgeni Selkov,[1] who also worked on mathematical modelling of metabolic processes./nThe parallel development of metabolic control theory by Henrik Kacser and Jim Burns[3] in Edinburgh shows that the time was ripe for a quantitative understanding of metabolic regulation. Instead of postulating a single rate-limiting step, these theories evaluated the degree of flux control exerted by an individual enzyme in a linear pathway or in a more complex network. The corresponding measure, now called the flux control coefficient by general agreement,[5] turned out to be a truly systemic quantity, depending not only on the kinetic parameters of the enzyme itself but also on those of other enzymes, as well as on the position of the reaction in the network. After a slow start metabolic control theory has become more widely known by biochemists. Control coefficients have been measured for many pathways, confirming the theoretical prediction that flux control is frequently shared by several reactions. This finding has become of practical importance for the genetic engineering of large metabolic networks in biotechnology./nThe dual approach \u2014 modelling concrete cellular processes and, at the same time, searching for general laws \u2014 has been a characteristic of Reinhart's work. The areas he worked in were amazingly diverse, including metabolic control, osmoregulation, cell shapes, signal transduction, vesicular transport, protein translation and transport, as well as the population dynamics of malaria parasites./nPerhaps the questions that interested him the most were those of evolution.[6] To understand the kinetic design of enzymes and enzymatic reaction networks, Reinhart strove to rationalize, in mathematical terms, the selective pressures and physico\u2013chemical constraints that these systems were subjected to. Reinhart's work on this topic is full of original insight and makes specific predictions, some of which have begun to be tested successfully in recent years./nReinhart was author of more than 160 research articles and, together with Stefan Schuster, the book The Regulation of Cellular Systems,[7] which has become a classic of cell systems biology.

Returning to Milan, she set up the vascular biology laboratory, which she headed until 1993.[1][2][3]/nWhile continuing to study vascular cell biology, Dejana also began to investigate angiogenesis, the process by which new blood vessels form in an embryo as well as during the growth of a tumour. Blocking blood vessel formation in a cancer may provide a means to stop the cancer's growth. The idea is that, if starved, the tumour will shrink and become more susceptible to treatment. She researched this topic from 1993 to 1996 as director of the hematology laboratory of the Centre d'\u00c9tudes Nucl\u00e9aires in Grenoble, France, while also teaching in Paris. Returning to Italy, she participated in a project of the Italian Foundation for Cancer Research (FIRC) to create a new institute dedicated to cancer research and, when the Molecular Oncology Institute (IFOM) was established in Milan, she was among the first scientists to set up her laboratory there.

His father was a city planner and his mother an elementary school teacher.[5] He entered the University of Cincinnati in 1969, majoring in biology. He had his first experience of basic research in his senior (or fourth) year of Bachelor of Science.

He started working on Tetrahymena, a ciliated unicellular eukaryote. Tetrahymena is an ideal candidate to study histone acetylation due to its dual nucleus. It has a larger macronucleus that is transcriptionally active and somatic, and a smaller micronucleus that is transcriptionally silent and germline.[10] Chromatin biology at the time was not a popular topic; nor was the use of ciliated organisms.[6]/nIn 1996, his group isolated the histone acetyltransferase p55 from Tetrahymena, an enzyme that acetylates histones, and found the enzyme was homologous to Gcn5p, a known transcriptional co-activator in yeast.[11][12] This was the first time that histone acetyltransferases were connected to DNA transcription activation,[13] verifying Vincent Allfrey's hypothesis in the 1960s that histone acetylation regulates transcription.[14][15]/nFollowing this seminal report, Allis continued studying histone acetylation, discovering more histone acetyltransferases, including TAF1 (part of the transcription factor TFIID needed to initiate transcription).[16] Allis also branched off to researching histone phosphorylation and histone methylation. He linked histone phosphorylation to mitosis and mitogen stimulation,[17][18] and established a synergistic relationship between histone phosphorylation and acetylation.[19] He also determined the role of methylation at lysine 9 of histone H3,[20] identified SET domain-containing proteins as histone methyltransferase,[21] and found that histone ubiquitylation regulates histone methylation.[22]/nIn 2000, Allis and Brian Strahl proposed the \"histone code hypothesis\", which states that DNA transcription is largely regulated by histone modifications.[23] Later, Allis (together with Thomas Jenuwein) explicitly associated the histone code with epigenetics,[24] and recognized the clinical significance of histone modifications, especially in cancers.[25][26]/nIn more recent years, his attention turned to \"oncohistones\", which are histones with mutations that distort normal histone modifications, leading to cancers.[27][28]/nAllis was a member of Phi Beta Kappa when he graduated from the University of Cincinnati.[8]/nThe C.

The daughter of German zoologists Maria and Hans-Wilhelm Koepcke, she became famous at the age of 17 as the sole survivor of the 1971 LANSA Flight 508 plane crash; after falling 3,000\u00a0m (10,000\u00a0ft) while strapped to her seat and suffering numerous injuries, she survived 11 days alone in the Peruvian Amazon rainforest until she was rescued by local fishermen after finding their camp./nKoepcke was born in Lima on 10 October 1954, the only child of German zoologists Maria (n\u00e9e von Mikulicz-Radecki; 1924\u20131971) and Hans-Wilhelm Koepcke (1914\u20132000). Her parents were working at Lima's Museum of Natural History when she was born. At the age of 14, she left Lima with her parents to establish the Panguana research station in the Amazon rainforest, where she learned survival skills. Educational authorities disapproved and she was required to return to the Deutsche Schule Lima Alexander von Humboldt to take her exams, graduating on 23 December 1971.[1]/nOn 24 December 1971, just one day after she graduated, Koepcke flew on LANSA Flight 508. Her mother Maria had wanted Juliane to return to Panguana with her on the 19th or 20th of December 1971, but Koepcke wanted to attend her graduation ceremony in Lima on 23 December. Maria agreed that they would stay for her graduation and instead they scheduled a flight for Christmas Eve. All flights were booked except for one with LANSA. Koepcke's father, Hans-Wilhelm, urged his wife to avoid flying with the airline due to its poor reputation.[1] Nonetheless, the flight was booked. The plane was struck by lightning mid-flight and began to disintegrate before plummeting to the ground. Koepcke found herself still strapped to her row of seats, falling 3,000\u00a0m (10,000\u00a0ft) into the Amazon rainforest./nKoepcke survived the fall but suffered injuries such as a broken collarbone, a deep cut on her right arm, an eye injury, and a concussion. She then spent 11 days in the rainforest, most of which were spent making her way through water by following a creek to a river. While in the jungle, she dealt with severe insect bites and an infestation of botfly larvae in her wounded arm. After nine days, she was able to find an encampment that had been set up by local fishermen. She gave herself rudimentary first aid, which included pouring gasoline on her arm to force the maggots out of the wound. A few hours later, the returning fishermen found her, gave her proper first aid, and used a canoe to transport her to a more inhabited area. She was soon airlifted to a hospital.[2]/nKoepcke's unlikely survival has been the subject of much speculation. Experts have said that she survived the fall because she was harnessed into her seat, the window seat, which was attached to the two seats to her left as part of a row of three. That was thought to have functioned as a parachute which slowed her fall.[3][4] The impact may have also been lessened by the updraft from a thunderstorm Koepcke fell through, as well as the thick foliage at her landing site.[3][4] As many as 14 other passengers were later discovered to have survived the initial crash but died while waiting to be rescued.[5]/nI had nightmares for a long time, for years, and of course the grief about my mother's death and that of the other people came back again and again.

He held a dual appointment as Professor of Molecular Biology and Biophysics from 1962 to 1966, and joined the Department of Human Genetics, which he helped organize, in 1972. He was also active in administration at the university level, serving as the university\u2019s director of Biological Sciences from 1964\u201369, and Deputy Provost for Biomedical Sciences from 1983 to his retirement in 1991.[12] The University brought him out of retirement to serve, first, as acting director of the Office of University Safety, and subsequently as acting director of the Peabody Museum./nOver the course of his 42-year academic career, Adelberg published over 200 papers in five research areas: (1) the biosynthesis of isoleucine and valine in Neurospora and Escherichia coli; (2) genetic regulation of amino acid biosynthesis in E. coli: (3) mechanisms of mutation in bacteria; (4) the bacterial chromosome, sex factors, and conjugations; and (5) membrane transport in cultured mammalian cells.[13]/nAdelberg's early work on pathways for biosynthesis of amino acids led to his 1953 groundbreaking discovery with HE Umbarger (then at Harvard University) that the end-product of a biosynthetic pathway could regulate the rate of its own biosynthesis, a process known as \u201cfeedback inhibition\u201d.[14]/nAdelberg's early research on bacterial conjugation also helped lay the groundwork for the field of recombinant DNA and genetic engineering. Following a sabbatical working with Francois Jacob at the Pasteur Institute in 1956-57, Adelberg discovered the phenomenon known variously as \u201cF-mediated transduction,\u201d \u201cF-duction,\u201d and sexduction, which consists of the transfer through recombination of chromosomal fragments by the sex factor (F) during bacterial conjugation.[15] Subsequent research led to his establishing that chromosomes in all cells of E. Coli K12 were circular, regardless of type.[16]/nBuilding on this work, Herbert Boyer, a post-doctoral fellow in Adelberg\u2019s laboratory at Yale in 1963-66, conducted research on restriction and modification in bacterial conjugation which led to the founding of the first biotech company, Genentech, and to the Boyer-Cohen method of gene-splicing.[17]/nIn addition to authoring seminal textbooks, Adelberg helped advance the field of microbial genetics by co-developing the system of nomenclature which has been adopted by all E. coli geneticists,;[18] and by establishing the Escherichia Coli Genetic Stock Center at Yale. The Center maintains a collection of about 28,000 cultures of genetically defined derivatives of E. coli K-12. The cultures are distributed to researchers and educators throughout the US and in over 65 countries worldwide. The Center also provides information about strains, mutations, genes, gene products and genetic maps, in a fully searchable database on the web.[1][19]/nAdelberg died at 88 on August 7, 2009.[20]", "37271387": "Kamala Sohonie (18 June 1911 \u2013 28 June 1998)[1] was an Indian biochemist who in 1939 became the first Indian woman to receive a PhD in a scientific discipline.[2][3] Her acceptance into and work at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, paved the way for women to be accepted into the institution for the first time in  its history.[4]/nHer research delved into the effects of vitamins and into the nutritive values of pulses, paddy, and groups of food items consumed by some of the poorest sections of the Indian population. Her work on the nutritional benefits of the palm extract called 'Neera' was inspired by the then-president Rajendra Prasad's suggestion. Kamala Sohonie received the Rashtrapati Award for this work.[5]/nKamala Sohonie (n\u00e9e Bhagvat) was born on 18 June 1911 in Indore, now in Madhya Pradesh, India. Her father, Narayanarao Bhagvat, as well as her uncle, Madhavrao Bhagvat, were chemists and alumni of the erstwhile Tata Institute of Sciences (which later became the Indian Institute of Science) in Bengaluru.[4] Kamala followed 'family tradition' and graduated in 1933 with a BSc degree in Chemistry (principal) and Physics (subsidiary) from Bombay University./nKamala then applied to the Indian Institute of Science for a research fellowship, but her application was turned down by the then-Director and Nobel Laureate Prof. C V Raman on the grounds that women were not considered competent enough to pursue research.[2] Kamala responded to the rejection by holding a 'satyagraha' outside Prof. C V .Raman's office, which persuaded him to grant her admission, but with some stipulations:/nAlthough admittedly humiliated by them, Kamala agreed to the terms, thus becoming in 1933 the first woman to be admitted into the institute.[6] She would later say, \"Though Raman was a great scientist, he was very narrow-minded. I can never forget the way he treated me just because I was a woman. Even then, Raman didn't admit me as a regular student. This was a great insult to me. The bias against women was so bad at that time. What can one expect if even a Nobel Laureate behaves in such a way?\". Also after a year, many women got their admission to the institution.[7]/nKamala's mentor at the IISc was Sri Srinivasayya. During her stint here, she worked on proteins in milk, pulses and legumes (a subject that was especially significant in the Indian context). Her dedication and research mettle influenced Prof. Raman's decision to let women into the IISc a year after she completed her MSc degree with distinction in 1936./nShe was then invited to UK's Cambridge University to work under Dr. Derek Richter in the Frederick G. Hopkins laboratory. She was a student of Newnham College, matriculating in 1937 and studying the Biological Natural Sciences Tripos.[8] When Richter left, she worked under Dr. Robin Hill and studied plant tissues. From her work on potatoes, she discovered the enzyme 'Cytochrome C' which plays an essential role in the electron transport chain (the process by which energy is created for organisms), found in plants, human and animal cells.[7] Her thesis on the subject was completed in 14 months and was 40 pages long, a departure from the usually much longer PhD submissions./nAfter receiving her PhD, Kamala returned to India in 1939. As a supporter of Mahatma Gandhi, she wanted to come back to her country and contribute to the nationalist struggle.[4] She was appointed Professor and Head of the Department of Biochemistry at Lady Hardinge Medical College in New Delhi. Later, she worked at the Nutrition Research Laboratory, Coonoor as Assistant Director, focusing on the effects of vitamins.[7]/nShe married M.V Sohonie, an actuary, in 1947 and moved to Mumbai. She joined the Royal Institute of Science as a Professor in the Department of Biochemistry, and worked on the nutritional aspects of legumes. Her eventual appointment to the position of Director of the Institute is believed to have been delayed by 4 years due to existing gender bias in the scientific community.[7] During this period, Kamala and her students conducted important research on three groups of food items that are majorly consumed by financially disadvantaged sections of people in India./nKamala started work on 'Neera' (sap extracted from the inflorescence of various species of toddy palms) on the suggestion of then-President of India, Rajendra Prasad. She found significant quantities of Vitamin A, Vitamin C, and iron in the drink, and that these elements can survive concentration of Neera into palm jaggery and molasses.[7]/nLater studies indicated that the inclusion of Neera in the diets of malnourished adolescent children and pregnant women from tribal communities as an inexpensive dietary supplement led to significant improvement in health.[5] She was awarded the Rashtrapati Award for her work in this subject./nKamala was an active member of the Consumer Guidance Society of India (CGSI). She was elected President of the CGSI for the 1982\u201383 period and she also authored articles on consumer safety for the organisational magazine called 'Keemat'./nKamala Sohonie died in 1998, shortly after collapsing during a felicitation ceremony organised by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in New Delhi.[5]/nOn 18 June 2023, search engine Google commemorated Sohonie with a Doodle on her 112th birth anniversary.[9]", "61716324": "Clodagh C.

He is currently Professor of Plant & Microbial Biology in the institution and Editor-in-Chief of the Planta journal.[1]/nHydrogen power is considered one of the key ways of producing electricity without continuing to use up fossil fuels.  The added bonus of using algae in this way is that they could consume carbon dioxide in the atmosphere./nIn 1998 Professor Anastasios Melis discovered, after following Hans Gaffron's work, that the deprivation of sulfur will cause Chlamydomonas reinhardtii algae to switch from producing oxygen to producing hydrogen.[2] The enzyme, hydrogenase, he found was responsible for the reaction, which is normally a temporary emergency survival mechanism used in an oxygen-deprived environment.[3] The enzyme stops functioning when oxygen is produced, however the deprivation of sulphur ensures continuous hydrogen production./nScientists since the 1940s have been trying to get the algae to produce hydrogen in significant quantities; he told media his breakthrough was like \"striking oil\". He currently leads an international effort to improve the efficiency of photosynthesis by up to 300% for increased photosynthetic productivity and hydrogen production.[1] He believes that one way for cost-competitiveness is to genetically modify the organisms to increase output./nIn 2001 he co-founded a company, Melis Energy, in order to exploit his discovery, hoping to get it on the market by 2005.  In the autumn of 2001, under his direction, the company built a bio-reactor containing 700 litres of water and algae that produced up to 1 litre of hydrogen per hour.[4] A siphoning system extracted the hydrogen, which is stored in its gaseous state.

At the start of the game, she escapes from the Aether Paradise, a conservation area owned by the Aether Foundation, with the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon Cosmog, whom she nicknames Nebby. Professor Kukui takes her on as his assistant after this, providing shelter for her and Nebby. After Nebby wanders off and the player character rescues it, she helps the player on their Island Challenge around the Alola region, while researching Nebby's origins. Later, Nebby is captured and brought to Aether Paradise. The player, their rivals Hau and Gladion, and Lillie, break into the Paradise to rescue Nebby, confronting the head of the organization, Lusamine, who is revealed to the player to be her and Gladion's mother. After Nebby evolves into Cosmoem and Lusamine disappears through a portal to the Ultra Space, a realm that links to numerous dimensions, that she forced Nebby to create, Lillie and the player head to the Altar on Poni Island, where using the mysterious items, the Sun Flute and the Moon Flute, they are able to get Nebby to evolve into either Solgaleo or Lunala, depending on the game version.

In 1851 he wrote a pamphlet that claimed animals and plants had evolved from a single filament. He sent a copy of the pamphlet to Darwin who described the writing style as \"ill-written\" and \"beyond my scope\".[2][3] However, in the Historical Sketch which first appeared in the 3rd Edition of Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1861), Freke is listed as an early evolution proponent.[1] On page 83 of his On the Origin of Species by Means of Organic Affinity (1861), Freke developed a theory of pangenesis, in which he proposed that all life was developed from microscopic organic agents which he named granules, which existed as 'distinct species of organizing matter' and would develop into different biological structures.[4][5]", "61716434": "Janelle S.

The Daan family was highly interested in biology and undertook enterprises in this field, such as investigating the ecology of reptiles in the Mediterranean area. As a consequence of this interest, Serge studied biology at the University of Amsterdam./nIn September 1973, Serge received his Ph.D. in Amsterdam (cum laude) with a thesis on hibernation. He was subsequently trained as a postdoc by the two founders of modern chronobiology, J\u00fcrgen Aschoff and Colin Pittendrigh. This 4-year episode, at the Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology in Andechs, Bavaria and Stanford University in California, and the lifelong collaboration and friendship with both were crucial for his professional career. In 1975, Daan was appointed associate professor at the University of Groningen in the Animal Ecology group of R.H. Drent. In 1994 he became Extra-ordinarius in Chronobiology, and in 1996 Professor of Ethology. Since 2003 he has occupied the prestigious Niko Tinbergen chair in Behavioral Biology./nSerge Daan\u2019s research focuses on the temporal organisation of behaviour in animals and humans. In about 250 publications he contributed a number of key concepts and models that have improved understanding of the \u2018circadian\u2019 (circa 24-h) rhythms of rest and activity, the regulation of human sleep, and the annual timing of reproduction./nWorking with Pittendrigh, Daan developed many of the theoretical foundations for understanding the dynamics of circadian oscillators.[2] Many other studies have followed, shifting the focus from behavioural black box models to testable hypotheses about underlying molecular mechanisms./nWork on circadian rhythms by others in the field culminated in the notion that a single circadian pacemaker exists to keep track of environmental time, while at the same time controlling downstream oscillations in physiology and behaviour. However, this notion was inconsistent with observations of the timing of sleep in human subjects living in isolation from time cues.[3] Serge Daan, together with Borb\u00e9ly and Beersma, developed a model which convincingly explained the observations. It was called the two-process model of sleep regulation and explained human sleep regulation in terms of two key processes: a circadian pacemaker, and a homeostatic drive to sleep that increases during wake and decreases during sleep.[4] Today, the two process model is used as the basis for most predictive models of sleep and performance./nApart from daily alternations in the environment, there are substantial seasonal variations that animals must adapt to across the year. Working with Drent, Daan showed that one strategy used to deal with seasonal changes is to adjust the number and even sex of offspring.[5]/nSerge Daan held many offices in academia. He was member of the board of Earth and Life Sciences of NWO \u2013 the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (1997\u20132002), and chairman of the NWO program Evolution and Behaviour (2002\u20132009).

She has engaged in theory and observation of coevolution and competition in Anolis lizards of the Caribbean, and recruitment limitation in the rocky intertidal zones of California and Oregon. She has more recently become known for her rejection of sexual selection, her theistic evolutionism, and her work on holobiont evolution./nRoughgarden was born in Paterson, New Jersey, United States. She received a Bachelor of Science in biology (with Distinction and Phi Beta Kappa) and a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy with highest honors from University of Rochester in 1968 and later a Ph.D. in biology from Harvard University in 1971. In 1998, Roughgarden came out as transgender and changed her name to Joan, making a coming out post on her website on her 52nd birthday.[1]/nRoughgarden worked as an instructor and Assistant Professor of Biology at the University of Massachusetts Boston from 1970 to 1972. In 1972 she joined the faculty of the Department of Biology at Stanford University. After becoming full professor she retired in 2011, and became Emeritus Professor. She founded and directed the Earth Systems Program at Stanford and has received awards for service to undergraduate education. In 2012 she moved to Hawaii, where she became an adjunct professor at the Hawai\u02bbi Institute of Marine Biology. In her academic career, Roughgarden advised 20 Ph.D. students and 15 postdoctoral fellows.[2]/nRoughgarden has authored books and over 180 scientific articles. In addition to a textbook on ecological and evolutionary theory in 1979, Roughgarden has carried out ecological field studies with Caribbean lizards and with barnacles and their larvae along the California coast. In 2015, she wrote the fiction novel Ram-2050, a science-fiction retelling of the Ramayana./nRoughgarden's early work in the 1970s and 80s helped to develop the Anolis lizards of the Caribbean as an important model system for evolution and ecology. For example, she used two-species enclosure experiments on two Caribbean islands to demonstrate increasing strength of interspecific competition as resource partitioning decreases:[3] a central tenet for competition theory. The Anolis system thus provided an early example of an eco-evolutionary feedback,[4] and with further development by Jonathan Losos and others, has become an important example of adaptive radiation./nAfter setting up a lab at the Hopkins Marine Station, Roughgarden sought to extend her approach of combining theoretical with field research by studying intertidal acorn barnacles (Balanus and Chthamalus spp). Earlier work by Joseph Connell, Bob Paine and others had suggested that the characteristic zonation of rocky intertidal communities was predominantly structured by predation,[5] (for example by Pisaster seastars) and by competition,[6][7] wherein dominant Balanus species displaced Chthamalus species to the high intertidal zones. Together with her student, Steve Gaines, Roughgarden showed that these interspecific interactions were most important in intertidal localities and communities with a high density of barnacles, such as those Connell and others had studied in Scotland.[6][8] At Hopkins in Central California, however, barnacle density was lower, and the amount of free space was best explained by periodic pulses of larval recruitment.[8] \u00a0With her student Sean Connolly, she then showed, through both empirical observation and modeling, that a latitudinal gradient in upwelling along the west coast of North America created very dense barnacle recruitment in the north (Oregon and Washington), where upwelling was weak, and very sparse barnacle recruitment in the south (California), where upwelling was strong.[9] This in turn explained why field studies in the north had found interspecific interactions to be important, while her own field studies in the south had found larval recruitment to be most important for structuring intertidal populations.[10] This deft synthesis helped to drive a paradigm shift in marine ecology which emphasized larval dispersal and recruitment dynamics over adult interactions and favored demographic models of populations open to larval recruits from distant localities, which dominated the field during the 1990s.[11]/nAround the time of her transition, Roughgarden began to shift her research focus to Darwin\u2019s theory of sexual selection. In her 2004 book, Evolution\u2019s Rainbow,[12] Roughgarden analyzes how biology can influence human sexuality and gender identity and explores the substantial diversity of mating systems and sexuality throughout the animal kingdom, with an eye toward understanding human sexual categories like gay, lesbian, and trans. In this book, and other articles around the same time, she offered criticism of sexual selection theory[13][14][15] by providing examples of species that depart from its predictions (such as homosexual behavior in bonobos, elephants and lizards) as well as highlighting contradictions between population genetic theory and sexual selection theory. She also provided the beginnings of an alternative theory to sexual selection called social selection, which she describes as being focused on natural selection based on differential offspring production, where sexual selection is focused on differential mating success./nA 2006 article in the journal Science with her student Erol Ak\u00e7ay, and Meeko Oishi, formally presented the theory of social selection in terms of game theory.[16] Beyond the Nash Competitive Equilibrium (NCE) imported to evolutionary biology by John Maynard Smith as the Evolutionary Stable Strategy, Roughgarden et al. discuss the Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS), which exists as an alternative to the NCE that is reached through negotiation. When playing in developmental time (as opposed to evolutionary time), a game player that stands to lose individual fitness at an NCE relative to its competitor may establish a threat point by promising to play a sub-optimal strategy. Through negotiation, for example via a side payment, the players can arrive at an NBS through playing mixed strategies across repeated games which thereby maximizes the fitness of the cooperative \"team\" (which consists of both players) rather than to any one player. Roughgarden et al. provide several examples of what such cooperative game play would look like in nature, and then define the evolutionary theory of social selection as one which considers such cooperative team games in the developmental tier as the primitive state, with sexual conflict as the derived state. They argue that social selection theory is mutually exclusive with the evolutionary theory of sexual selection, which treats sexual conflict as the primitive state and sexual cooperation as derived./nFollowing the Science paper, forty scientists produced ten critical letters[17][18] stating that the article was misleading, that it contained misunderstandings and misrepresentations, that sexual selection accounted for all the data presented and subsumed Roughgarden's theoretical analysis, and that sexual selection explained data that her theory could not.[17][18] Troy Day stated that \"many people felt that this was completely shoddy science and poor scholarship, all motivated by a personal agenda\".[17] Roughgarden stated she was \"not altogether surprised\" by the volume of dissent and that her theory was not an extension of sexual selection theory.[17][18]/nTim Clutton-Brock of Oxford University wrote a more detailed rebuttal in Science in 2007,[19] in which he concedes the point that males can engage in sexual selection on females, even in species where the operational sex ratio is biased towards males, stating: \"Consequently, satisfactory explanations of the evolution of sex differences requires an understanding of the operation of sexual selection in females as well as males\".[19] Nevertheless, Clutton-Brock concludes that sexual selection is a robust theoretical framework, without ever addressing the theoretical distinction in the polarity of intersexual cooperation and conflict highlighted by Roughgarden et al.[16]/nIn her 2009 book The Genial Gene,[20] Roughgarden continues to build a case against sexual selection theory and to present social selection theory as an alternative. The book is titled as a response to the popular book, The Selfish Gene, by Richard Dawkins,[21] which expounds what Roughgarden describes a \u201cneo-Spencerian\u201d view of nature \u201cred in tooth and claw\u201d in which competition and conflict dominate. In The Genial Gene, after an initial section defining and attacking sexual selection, followed by a definition of social selection as one based on differences in offspring-production, rather than differences in mating success./nA second section is focused on the genetic basis of social selection. The first chapter addresses how sexual reproduction evolved in the first place, and makes the case for Roughgarden\u2019s Portfolio hypothesis, which emphasizes that sexual reproduction creates genetic diversity through recombination, as opposed to the more commonly favored Muller\u2019s Ratchet, which emphasizes that sex removes deleterious mutations through recombination. The second chapter explains the binary distribution of gamete types (sperm vs. egg) as a strategy to maximize gametic contact, rather than as a result of conflicting gametic strategies. A final chapter argues that hermaphroditism, rather than gonochorism, is the primitive state of sexuality./nThe third section takes a two-tier approach to developing social selection theory. A behavioral tier focuses on game theory and Nash Bargaining Solutions as outlined in her 2006 paper.[16] A second population genetic tier is then described that operates as a result of many replays of the behavioral tier. \u00a0The book concludes by listing 26 phenomena that, according to Roughgarden, are explained differently by sexual selection theory and are better explained by social selection theory. She says that sexual selection theory derives from a view of natural behavior predicated on the selfish-gene concept, competition and deception, whereas the social-selection theory derives from teamwork, honesty, and genetic equality. As of 2012 she has continued to study if social selection as opposed to sexual selection is a more important driver of evolution for colonial species such as corals or perhaps humans.[22][23]/nRoughgarden's criticism of sexual selection has been rejected by the scientific community, and her papers on it have received few citations in scientific literature.[24] In a 2019 interview, she stated that \"Most biologists remain defensive of sexual selection theory\u201d.[15]/nIn 2013, Roughgarden funded a Catalysis meeting at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center with the goal of debating and reviewing \"the status of sexual selection studies and to indicate challenges and future directions\".[25] The group struggled to come to a consensus definition of sexual selection, but a subgroup offered a definition that for the first time explicitly differentiated fecundity selection for sexual selection sensu stricto.[25]/nRoughgarden has written on the relationship between Christianity and science.[26] Her book Evolution and Christian Faith: Reflections of an Evolutionary Biologist presents scripture passages that emphasize her belief that the Bible does not conflict with evolutionary biology and relates Christianity and evolution by asserting that all life is interconnected, as members of a faith community are connected. Roughgarden opposes creationism and intelligent design, but asserts her belief in God's involvement in evolution.[27] She was a speaker at the Beyond Belief symposium in 2006.[28]/nAs professor emerita, Dr. Roughgarden turned her attention to the emerging concept of the holobiont, which she defined as \u201can animal or plant host together with all the microbes living on or in it, exosymbionts and endosymbionts, respectively.[29]\u201d The concept, which originated in 1943, has had increasing recognition with the rise of second and third-generation DNA sequencing methods that allow the microbial communities (i.e. the microbiome) of a host to be examined. The close association between the microbiome and its host has led many[30][31][32] \u00a0to suggest that the holobiont may be an evolutionary unit of selection, in which the combination of the host\u2019s genes with those of its microbiome produce an extended genome, or hologenome. However, the hologenome concept has been criticized on the grounds that microbiomes are usually not vertically transmitted from parent to child,[33] thereby violating what is commonly thought to be one of the key principles of natural selection: variation inherited in a Mendelian fashion./nTogether with other proponents of the holobiont concept, Roughgarden wrote a 2018 review of the topic[29] in which they examined the evidence for the holobiont as a biological entity. They considered the tight integration of physiological, developmental, reproductive and even immunological components between host and microbial symbionts to provide a foundation for this concept. For example mammalian mothers\u2019 milk contains sugars that appear to be for the benefit of the microbial symbionts, because they cannot be metabolized by the newborn.[34] \u00a0They also cite the horizontal acquisition of DNA coding for syncytin,[35] a protein that allows formation of the placenta, as a key step in the evolution of placental mammals, which also demonstrates adaptive evolution in the holobiont./nIn this review,[29] Roughgarden begins to sketch a population genetic model of holobiont evolution, containing a host species, and a single microbial symbiont, and in which selection is based only on the number of copies of the symbiont genome acquired by the host. The model contains three sequential processes per generation: microbes can move between hosts, they can proliferate within hosts and holobionts can survive or perish dependent on the number of symbionts acquired. This model was enough to show that, with vertical transmission, a deleterious symbiont will reduce the number of holobionts (and symbionts), while a beneficial symbiont will tend to increase the sizes of both groups. However, horizontal transmission \u201cbinds the collection of microbiomes into a unified system, a meta-community, rather than a collection of independent communities\u201d./nRoughgarden followed this review with two papers[36][37] that further fleshed out her model of holobiont evolution. The first[36] showed that, when microbes colonize hosts following a Poisson distribution, horizontal transmission can still lead to holobiont evolution when beneficial symbionts increase the success of their hosts and thus flood the microbial source pool (the converse case with parasitic microbes also holds true). She calls this phenomenon \u201ccollective inheritance\u201d as opposed to lineal Mendelian inheritance. The second paper[37] adds a second microbial species to the model, as well as a \u201ccolonization parameter\u201d d, which partially determines the Poisson rate parameter. The d parameter approximates the density of the symbiont strain around the host, or the host\u2019s selectivity for the symbiont species, depending on context. Because microbial colonization of the host follows a Poisson distribution, there is no Hardy-Weinberg analog, and directional selection tends to be more diffuse than expectated under vertical transmission. She then reasons from this two-microbe model that the host is likely to use antibodies and \u201cprobodies\u201d to modulate d for each microbial species, in effect orchestrating things so that only microbes that provide some minimum amount of altruism toward their host are allowed to remain in symbiosis with the host. From the microbe\u2019s standpoint, those species that provide the minimum amount of altruism to clear the host\u2019s threshold will tend to outcompete those that provide more. This paper[37] carefully demonstrates that this host-orchestrated species selection process is conceptually distinct from co-evolution or multi-level selection and can predict and explain the tight integration of hosts and their microbial symbionts found throughout the eukaryotic tree of life./nRoughgarden has served as associate editor of several academic journals, including Philosophy and Theory in Biology (since 2008), American Naturalist (1984\u20131989), Oecologia (1979\u20131982), and Theoretical Population Biology (1975\u20131986).

She is also a Senior Research Associate at the University of Oxford.[8]/nKiers is best known for her work on mycorrhizal networks, studying the rates of exchange of nutrients. Her observations are that fungi in the soil behave as economic agents in a free-market system, supplying more phosphorus to plants that are able to deliver more sugar in exchange.[9][10][11] Based on this hypothesis, Kiers is interested in developing fungi that behave \"altruistically\" in their environment to foster efficient plant growth and reduce the need for fertilizers.[2][12] This interpretation of soil interactions as competition complicated the picture of a collaborative equilibrium that had begun to develop prior. It also allows Kiers to borrow mathematical models from economic theory to characterize nutrient exchanges. To track the flow of nutrients, Kiers has pioneered the use of quantum dots to tag molecules so that they fluoresce and can be more easily differentiated.[13] Her work also concerns the evolution of plant-fungal interactions as the organisms evolve and enter into contact with new partners.[14] Her research is supported by the European Research Council,[15] the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) and the National Science Foundation.[8]/nKiers's economic interpretation of nutrient exchange is not universally accepted. Others have noted that this perspective anthropomorphizes fungi in a way that may not accurately capture the true dynamics of the system.

These have included videos of him removing a plastic drinking straw from the nostril of a sea turtle[1] as well as a plastic fork from the nostril of a different sea turtle,[2] and a video recorded by him and Edith Widder of a live giant squid.[3] This video is the first-time that a live giant squid has been recorded in US waters and is the second time this species has ever been caught alive on film./nRobinson grew up in the United Kingdom. He earned a Masters of Marine Biology at the University of Southampton in 2009, receiving the awarded for the highest achieving MSc student of his graduating class. Nathan's MSc focused on learning how shallow-water marine species might adapt to deeper habitats. While completing his MSc program, he also began volunteering with the ARCHELON, the Sea Turtle Protection Society of Greece. He followed his interest in sea turtle conservation into a Ph.D. program at Purdue University under the mentor-ship of Frank V. Paladino. His Ph.D. thesis focused on understanding the factors driving the migratory behavior of sea turtles.[4]/nIn 2015, Robinson was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship through Purdue University Fort Wayne to manage the research activities of the Leatherback Trust in Costa Rica. During this fellowship, Robinson joined a Texas A&M research expedition collecting data in northwest Costa Rica to sample olive ridley sea turtles for epibionts. While Robinson was examining a turtle for epibionts, he discovered something in a turtle's nostril.[5] Upon removing the foreign object, it was revealed to be a plastic drinking straw. Expedition leader Christine Figgener recorded this video, which subsequently went viral and has inspired several anti-plastic straw campaigns worldwide.[6]/nTwo months after removing the straw, Robinson was again studying olive ridley turtles on Playa Ostional, Costa Rica and had a similar encounter. However, this time the object being removed was a plastic fork. This video, recorded by Sean Williamson, also went viral and prompted several other campaigns against single-use plastics.[7]/nFollowing the impact of these two videos, Robinson began to focus his research activities on using novel visual technologies to generate engaging footage for the purposes of scientific discovery and environmental outreach. This has included projects using drones,[8] animal-borne cameras,[9][10] and deep-sea cameras.[11]/nIn 2019, Nathan was working alongside Edith Widder in the Gulf of Mexico where they were able to film a live giant squid.[3] This video was the first-time that a live giant squid has been recorded in US waters, is the second time this species has ever been caught alive on film./nIn 2022, Nathan was invited to present at Gresham College to give a talk entitled \"Going Viral: An Environmental Activist's Story\".[12]/nBetween 2015 and 1017, Nathan was Director of the Leatherback Trust in Costa Rica and a postdoctoral fellow at Purdue University Fort Wayne. Between 2017 and 2019, Nathan was Director of the Cape Eleuthera Institute in The Bahamas. Since 2019, Nathan has worked for L'Oceanogr\u00e0fic and the Institut de Ci\u00e8ncies del Mar, Barcelona./nNathan is the author of several scientific publications, conference papers, and reports[13]", "2242577": "Ivan Honl  (23 April 1866 in Zb\u00fd\u0161ov, Moravia \u2013  7 June 1936 in L\u00e1zn\u011b B\u011bloves\u00a0[cs], N\u00e1chod, Czechoslovakia) was a Czech bacteriologist, serologist and activist in the struggle against tuberculosis. Honl became one of founders of Czech microbiology./nUnder the guidance of Jaroslav Hlava Honl gained his habilitation in bacteriology at Charles University in Prague in 1898. In 1919 he was named head to the new Czech Bacteriological Institute (\u00dastav pro bakteriologii a s\u00e9rologii L\u00e9ka\u0159sk\u00e9 fakulty Univerzity Karlovy). ./nHonl was one of the early researchers of antibiotics. At the end of the 1890s he isolated a product of Bacterium pyocyaneum (today called Pseudomonas aeruginosa), which was used as medicine (Anginol) from the start of WWI until it was replaced by penicillin after WWII./nIn 1899 he co-founded an institute to treat tuberculosis in Czechoslovakia and was active in this struggle for decades.", "38877212": "Devra Gail Kleiman  (November 15, 1942 \u2013 April 29, 2010) was an American biologist who helped create the field of conservation biology.[1]  She is known for her work to conserve endangered species, especially the golden lion tamarin of Brazil.[2] Her efforts to use zoos to manage genetics of rare species was \"one of the greatest success stories in the history of modern zoos,\" according to Steven Monfort, director of the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.[1] She is also known for her efforts to breed pandas at the National Zoo./nBorn in the Bronx, Kleiman attended the University of Chicago, intending to go into medicine. However, after taking a baby dingo home to her mother's house, where it wrecked the basement, and working on a project to tame wolves, she shifted her major to animal behavior, graduating in 1964. She received a Ph.D. in zoology from University of London in 1969 and joined the staff of the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. in 1972. In 1979, she was named head of the Department of Zoological Research and in 1986 rose to assistant director for research. She was also appointed to the biology staff at University of Maryland where she served as adjunct professor./nKleiman's greatest success was with the golden lion tamarin, a small, reddish-orange monkey that inhabits Brazil's coastal forest. In the early 1970s she responded to an emergency alert from Brazilian biologist Adelmar Coimbra Filho, who reported that the tamarin population was down to several hundred in the wild and only 75 in captivity. Kleiman worked with Filho to convince more than a dozen zoos to engage in a cooperative lending program to foster breeding. She also used genetic data to try to assure stronger offspring. Kleiman and Filho also worked to preserve and restore large swaths of habitat for the tamarin. By the time of Kleiman's death, there were about 1,600 golden lion tamarins in the wild and 500 in zoos around the world./nKleiman also greatly advanced scientific knowledge of the panda. When the Chinese government donated a pair of pandas to the National Zoo in 1972, there was massive public interest in their breeding. However, the first four pregnancies all failed. Kleiman led a large team that eventually discovered that the conventional wisdom about pandas\u2014that they are solitary creatures\u2014was incorrect.[3] After the zoo modified their living situation to allow interaction and socialization, the next pair of pandas successfully produced a baby./nKleiman's publications include Wild Mammals in Captivity and Lion Tamarins: Biology and Conservation.[4]/nKleiman has a scientific advancement award named after her.[5]/nShe died of cancer at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.
