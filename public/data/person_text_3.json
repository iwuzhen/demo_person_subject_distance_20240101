He was educated at the University of Turin, where he qualified as an engineer and became a doctor of mathematics. As an officer of engineers he replaced Cavour in 1831 at the fortress of Bard. He then became professor of mechanics and construction at the military academy and at the university of Turin.[1] Among his notable publications: Sketch of the Analytical Engine Invented by Charles Babbage, Esq. with notes by translator Ada Lovelace (1842), which described many aspects of computer architecture and is considered the first modern example of programming.

He entered the Piedmontese parliament, and was attached successively to the Ministries of War and Foreign Affairs.[1]/nMenabrea belonged to the right centre, and until the events of 1859 he believed in the possibility of a compromise between the Vatican and the state. He was major-general and commander-in-chief of the engineers in the Lombard campaign of 1859. He superintended the siege works against Peschiera, was present at Palestro and Solferino, and repaired the fortifications of some of the northern fortresses. In 1860 he became lieutenant-general and conducted the siege of Gaeta. He was appointed senator and received the title of count.[1]/nEntering the Ricasoli cabinet of 1861 as minister for the navy, he held the portfolio of public works until 1864 in the succeeding Farini and Minghetti cabinets. After the war of 1866, he was chosen as Italian plenipotentiary for the negotiation of the Treaty of Prague and for the transfer of Venetia to Italy. In October 1867, he succeeded Rattazzi in the premiership, and was called upon to deal with the difficult situation created by Garibaldi's invasion of the Papal States and by the catastrophe of Mentana.[1]/nMenabrea disavowed Garibaldi and instituted judicial proceedings against him; but in negotiations with the French government he protested against the retention of the temporal power by the pope and insisted on the Italian right of interference in Rome. He was in on the secret of the direct negotiations between Victor Emmanuel and Napoleon III in June 1869, and refused to entertain the idea of a French alliance unless Italy were allowed to occupy the Papal States, and, on occasion, Rome itself. On the eve of the assembly of the Oecumenical Council at Rome Menabrea reserved to the Italian government its right in respect of any measures directed against Italian institutions.[1]/nHe withdrew from seminary students in 1860 the exemption from military service which they had hitherto enjoyed. Throughout his term of office he was supported by the finance minister Count Cambray Digny, who forced through parliament the grist tax proposed by Quintino Sella, though in an altered form from the earlier proposal. After a series of changes in the cabinet, and many crises, Menabrea resigned in December 1869 on the election of a new chamber in which he did not command a majority. He was made marquis of Valdora in 1875. His successor in the premiership, Giovanni Lanza, in order to remove him from his influential position as aide-de-camp to the king, sent him to London as ambassador, where he remained until in 1882 he replaced General Cialdini at the Paris Embassy.

His birth date is variously suggested as c.1515[1] or c.1520 (but certainly by 1530).[2]/nMuch of his work was expanded on, annotated, and published by his son, Thomas Digges.[2] His son followed in his footsteps and was a pivotal player in the popularisation of Copernicus's book De revolutionibus orbium coelestium. Notes written by Thomas Digges in the publication of the book Pantometria in 1570 contain descriptions of how Leonard Digges made use of a \"proportional Glass\" to view distant objects and people. Some, such as astronomer and historian Colin Ronan, claim this describes a reflecting or refracting telescope built between 1540 and 1559, but its vague description and claimed performance makes it dubious.[3][4][5]/nLeonard Digges, born about 1515, was the only son of James Digges (born c.1473), esquire, of Digges Court and Broome in Barham, Kent, by his second wife, Philippe Engham, the daughter of John Engham, esquire, of Chart, Kent. James Digges had been High Sheriff of Kent in 1510\u201311, and had married as his first wife Mildred Fineux, the daughter of Sir John Fineux, Chief Justice of the King's Bench, and Elizabeth Apuldrefield, by whom he had an only son, John Digges, who married Mildred Scott, the daughter of Sir John Scott (d. 7 October 1533) of Scot's Hall in Smeeth, Kent. John Digges predeceased his father, leaving two sons by his wife, Mildred Scott, William Digges and Francis Digges. James Digges made his last will on 20 February 1535/6 requesting burial in the north chancel of the church of Barham, 'where my mother and my wife do lie', and naming as executors his second wife, Philippe; John Sackville, esquire; his nephew, Robert Brent, gentleman; and his son, Leonard, with Sir William Hawte as overseer.[6] The will was proved on 24 November 1540, at which time his second wife, Philippe, was still living.[7]/nLeonard Digges was the grandson of John Digges, esquire, of Digges Court and Broome, High Sheriff of Kent in 1495-6, and his wife Joan Clifton, the daughter and co-heiress of Sir Gervase Clifton of Clifton, Nottinghamshire, London, and Brabourne, Kent, by his first wife, Isabel Herbert, daughter of Vincent Herbert, esquire.[8] Leonard Digges' aunt, Isabel Digges, the daughter of John Digges and Joan Clifton, married Richard Sackville (d. 28 July 1524), esquire, and was the mother of John Sackville.[9]/nIn 1542 Digges, in company with three other gentlemen, visited the castle of Gu\u00eenes, 'where they impressed their host through debate and demonstration of their skills in geometry, navigation, measurement, and artillery'.[1]/nIn January 1554 Digges took part in an unsuccessful rebellion led by the Protestant Sir Thomas Wyatt, who opposed the projected marriage between Philip II of Spain and England's new Catholic Queen, Mary I. Digges was convicted of high treason, attainted, and condemned to death. His life was pardoned on 1 April 1554, but according to Johnston 'his lands and goods, which had been seized after his attainder, continued to be held subject to payment of recognizances to the crown'. In February 1555 Digges was fined 400 marks.

Subsequent editions reprint the text from 1556; editions from 1576 and later include additional material by his son./nThere are claims Leonard Digges independently invented the reflecting telescope, and/or the refracting telescope as part of his need to see accurately over long distances during his surveying works.[3][4] In the preface to the 1591 Pantometria, (a book on measurement, partially based on his father's notes and observations) Leonard's son Thomas lauded his father's accomplishments. Some of the praise of the son for the father appears to be extravagant exaggeration, while other claims appear more credible.

It is these details which led some researchers, most notably Colin Ronan, to claim that Leonard Digges invented a functioning telescope sometime between 1540 and 1559. The description seemed to suggest that Digges created a rudimentary instrument incorporating lenses and a concave mirror, in a manner rather different from a modern reflecting telescope. However, the construction of lenses to the required optical precision would have been very difficult in the 16th century, and the construction of an adequate mirror would have been much harder still.[5] It is doubtful that Digges built a successful instrument, and the optical performance required to see the details of coins lying about in fields, or private activities seven miles away was far beyond the technology of the time.[5]/nDigges Cove in Antarctica is named after Leonard Digges.", "1516419": "Jotun John Piet Hein (born 19 July 1956) is Professor of Bioinformatics at the Department of Statistics of the University of Oxford and a professorial fellow of University College, Oxford.

Diophantus coined the term \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (parisotes) to refer to an approximate equality.[5] This term was rendered as adaequalitas in Latin, and became the technique of adequality developed by Pierre de Fermat to find maxima for functions and tangent lines to curves. Diophantus was the first Greek mathematician who recognized positive rational numbers as numbers, by allowing fractions for coefficients and solutions./nDiophantus was born into a Greek family and is known to have lived in Alexandria, Egypt, during the Roman era, between AD 200 and 214 to 284 or 298.[4][6][7][a] Much of our knowledge of the life of Diophantus is derived from a 5th-century Greek anthology of number games and puzzles created by Metrodorus. One of the problems (sometimes called his epitaph) states:/nThis puzzle implies that Diophantus' age x can be expressed as/nwhich gives x a value of 84 years. However, the accuracy of the information cannot be confirmed./nIn popular culture, this puzzle was the Puzzle No.142 in Professor Layton and Pandora's Box as one of the hardest solving puzzles in the game, which needed to be unlocked by solving other puzzles first./nArithmetica is the major work of Diophantus and the most prominent work on algebra in Greek mathematics. It is a collection of problems giving numerical solutions of both determinate and indeterminate equations. Of the original thirteen books of which Arithmetica consisted only six have survived, though there are some who believe that four Arabic books discovered in 1968 are also by Diophantus.[12] Some Diophantine problems from Arithmetica have been found in Arabic sources./nIt should be mentioned here that Diophantus never used general methods in his solutions. Hermann Hankel, renowned German mathematician made the following remark regarding Diophantus./n\"Our author (Diophantos) not the slightest trace of a general, comprehensive method is discernible; each problem calls for some special method which refuses to work even for the most closely related problems.  For this reason it is difficult for the modern scholar to solve the 101st problem even after having studied 100 of Diophantos's solutions\".[13]/nLike many other Greek mathematical treatises, Diophantus was forgotten in Western Europe during the Dark Ages, since the study of ancient Greek, and literacy in general, had greatly declined.  The portion of the Greek Arithmetica that survived, however, was, like all ancient Greek texts transmitted to the early modern world, copied by, and thus known to, medieval Byzantine scholars. Scholia on Diophantus by the Byzantine Greek scholar John Chortasmenos (1370\u20131437) are preserved together with a comprehensive commentary written by the earlier Greek scholar Maximos Planudes (1260 \u2013 1305), who produced an edition of Diophantus within the library of the Chora Monastery in Byzantine Constantinople.[14] In addition, some portion of the Arithmetica probably survived in the Arab tradition (see above). In 1463 German mathematician Regiomontanus wrote:/nArithmetica was first translated from Greek into Latin by Bombelli in 1570, but the translation was never published. However, Bombelli borrowed many of the problems for his own book Algebra. The editio princeps of Arithmetica was published in 1575 by Xylander. The Latin translation of Arithmetica by Bachet in 1621 became the first Latin edition that was widely available. Pierre de Fermat owned a copy, studied it and made notes in the margins. A later 1895 Latin translation by Paul Tannery was said to be an improvement by Thomas L. Heath, who used it in the 1910 second edition of his English translation./nThe 1621 edition of Arithmetica by Bachet gained fame after Pierre de Fermat wrote his famous \"Last Theorem\" in the margins of his copy:/nFermat's proof was never found, and the problem of finding a proof for the theorem went unsolved for centuries. A proof was finally found in 1994 by Andrew Wiles after working on it for seven years.  It is believed that Fermat did not actually have the proof he claimed to have. Although the original copy in which Fermat wrote this is lost today, Fermat's son edited the next edition of Diophantus, published in 1670. Even though the text is otherwise inferior to the 1621 edition, Fermat's annotations\u2014including the \"Last Theorem\"\u2014were printed in this version./nFermat was not the first mathematician so moved to write in his own marginal notes to Diophantus; the Byzantine scholar John Chortasmenos (1370\u20131437) had written \"Thy soul, Diophantus, be with Satan because of the difficulty of your other theorems and particularly of the present theorem\" next to the same problem.[14]/nDiophantus wrote several other books besides Arithmetica, but only a few of them have survived./nDiophantus himself refers to a work which consists of a collection of lemmas called The Porisms (or Porismata), but this book is entirely lost.[15]/nAlthough The Porisms is lost, we know three lemmas contained there, since Diophantus refers to them in the Arithmetica. One lemma states that the difference of the cubes of two rational numbers is equal to the sum of the cubes of two other rational numbers, i.e. given any a and b, with a > b, there exist c and d, all positive and rational, such that/nDiophantus is also known to have written on polygonal numbers, a topic of great interest to Pythagoras and Pythagoreans. Fragments of a book dealing with polygonal numbers are extant.[16]/nA book called Preliminaries to the Geometric Elements has been traditionally attributed to Hero of Alexandria. It has been studied recently by Wilbur Knorr, who suggested that the attribution to Hero is incorrect, and that the true author is Diophantus.[17]/nDiophantus' work has had a large influence in history. Editions of Arithmetica exerted a profound influence on the development of algebra in Europe in the late sixteenth and through the 17th and 18th centuries.  Diophantus and his works also influenced Arab mathematics and were of great fame among Arab mathematicians. Diophantus' work created a foundation for work on algebra and in fact much of advanced mathematics is based on algebra.[18] How much he affected India is a matter of debate./nDiophantus has been considered \"the father of algebra\" because of his contributions to number theory, mathematical notations and the earliest known use of syncopated notation in his book series Arithmetica.[2] However this is usually debated, because Al-Khwarizmi was also given the title as \"the father of algebra\", nevertheless both mathematicians were responsible for paving the way for algebra today./nToday, Diophantine analysis is the area of study where integer (whole-number) solutions are sought for equations, and Diophantine equations are polynomial equations with integer coefficients to which only integer solutions are sought. It is usually rather difficult to tell whether a given Diophantine equation is solvable. Most of the problems in Arithmetica lead to quadratic equations. Diophantus looked at 3 different types of quadratic equations: ax2 + bx = c, ax2 = bx + c, and ax2 + c = bx. The reason why there were three cases to Diophantus, while today we have only one case, is that he did not have any notion for zero and he avoided negative coefficients by considering the given numbers a, b, c to all be positive in each of the three cases above.  Diophantus was always satisfied with a rational solution and did not require a whole number which means he accepted fractions as solutions to his problems. Diophantus considered negative or irrational square root solutions \"useless\", \"meaningless\", and even \"absurd\". To give one specific example, he calls the equation 4 = 4x + 20 'absurd' because it would lead to a negative value for x. One solution was all he looked for in a quadratic equation. There is no evidence that suggests Diophantus even realized that there could be two solutions to a quadratic equation. He also considered simultaneous quadratic equations./nDiophantus made important advances in mathematical notation, becoming the first person known to use algebraic notation and symbolism. Before him everyone wrote out equations completely. Diophantus introduced an algebraic symbolism that used an abridged notation for frequently occurring operations, and an abbreviation for the unknown and for the powers of the unknown. Mathematical historian Kurt Vogel states:[19]/n\"The symbolism that Diophantus introduced for the first time, and undoubtedly devised himself, provided a short and readily comprehensible means of expressing an equation... Since an abbreviation is also employed for the word 'equals', Diophantus took a fundamental step from verbal algebra towards symbolic algebra.\"/nAlthough Diophantus made important advances in symbolism, he still lacked the necessary notation to express more general methods. This caused his work to be more concerned with particular problems rather than general situations. Some of the limitations of Diophantus' notation are that he only had notation for one unknown and, when problems involved more than a single unknown, Diophantus was reduced to expressing \"first unknown\", \"second unknown\", etc. in words. He also lacked a symbol for a general number n. Where we would write 12 + 6n/n2 \u2212 3, Diophantus has to resort to constructions like:  \"... a sixfold number increased by twelve, which is divided by the difference by which the square of the number exceeds three\". Algebra still had a long way to go before very general problems could be written down and solved succinctly./n\"But what we really want to know is to what extent the Alexandrian mathematicians of the period from the first to the fifth centuries C.E. were Greek. Certainly, all of them wrote in Greek and were part of the Greek intellectual community of Alexandria. And most modern studies conclude that the Greek community coexisted [...] So should we assume that Ptolemy and Diophantus, Pappus and Hypatia were ethnically Greek, that their ancestors had come from Greece at some point in the past but had remained effectively isolated from the Egyptians? It is, of course, impossible to answer this question definitively. But research in papyri dating from the early centuries of the common era demonstrates that a significant amount of intermarriage took place between the Greek and Egyptian communities [...] And it is known that Greek marriage contracts increasingly came to resemble Egyptian ones. In addition, even from the founding of Alexandria, small numbers of Egyptians were admitted to the privileged classes in the city to fulfill numerous civic roles. Of course, it was essential in such cases for the Egyptians to become \"Hellenized,\" to adopt Greek habits and the Greek language. Given that the Alexandrian mathematicians mentioned here were active several hundred years after the founding of the city, it would seem at least equally possible that they were ethnically Egyptian as that they remained ethnically Greek. In any case, it is unreasonable to portray them with purely European features when no physical descriptions exist.\"/n\"Diophantos was most likely a Hellenized Babylonian.\"", "71771035": "Ram Kishore Saxena  D.Sc , FNASc (11 November 1936) is an Indian mathematician and Emeritus professor, UGC Jai Narain Vyas University and former Professor and Head, Department of Mathematics.[1][2][3][4]/nUniversity of Jodhpur/nAl-Fateh University Professor\nUniversity of Jodhpur\nJaswant College, Jodhpur \nLohia College,Churu\nMaharana Bhupal College, Udaipur\nMohanlal Sukhadia University/nSaxena has published 356 research papers;[4][5][6] under his supervision many scholars has done PhD and post-doctoral research.[1] Saxena has published books.[7][8][9][10][11]/n/nThis article about an Indian mathematician is a stub.

His 1872 Erlangen program classified geometries by their basic symmetry groups and was an influential synthesis of much of the mathematics of the time./nDuring his tenure at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, Klein was able to turn it into a center for mathematical and scientific research through the establishment of new lectures, professorships, and institutes. His seminars covered most areas of mathematics then known as well as their applications. Klein also devoted considerable time to mathematical instruction, and promoted mathematics education reform at all grade levels in Germany and abroad. He became the first president of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction in 1908 at the Fourth International Congress of Mathematicians in Rome./nFelix Klein was born on 25 April 1849 in D\u00fcsseldorf,[1] to Prussian parents. His father, Caspar Klein (1809\u20131889), was a Prussian government official's secretary stationed in the Rhine Province. His mother was Sophie Elise Klein (1819\u20131890, n\u00e9e Kayser).[2] He attended the Gymnasium in D\u00fcsseldorf, then studied mathematics and physics at the University of Bonn,[3] 1865\u20131866, intending to become a physicist. At that time, Julius Pl\u00fccker had Bonn's professorship of mathematics and experimental physics, but by the time Klein became his assistant, in 1866, Pl\u00fccker's interest was mainly geometry. Klein received his doctorate, supervised by Pl\u00fccker, from the University of Bonn in 1868./nPl\u00fccker died in 1868, leaving his book concerning the basis of line geometry incomplete. Klein was the obvious person to complete the second part of Pl\u00fccker's Neue Geometrie des Raumes, and thus became acquainted with Alfred Clebsch, who had relocated to G\u00f6ttingen in 1868. Klein visited Clebsch the next year, along with visits to Berlin and Paris. In July 1870, at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War, he was in Paris and had to leave the country. For a brief time he served as a medical orderly in the Prussian army before being appointed Privatdozent (lecturer) at G\u00f6ttingen in early 1871./nThe University of Erlangen appointed Klein professor in 1872, when he was only 23 years old.[4] For this, he was endorsed by Clebsch, who regarded him as likely to become the best mathematician of his time. Klein did not wish to remain in Erlangen, where there were very few students, and was pleased to be offered a professorship at the Technische Hochschule M\u00fcnchen in 1875. There he and Alexander von Brill taught advanced courses to many excellent students, including Adolf Hurwitz, Walther von Dyck, Karl Rohn, Carl Runge, Max Planck, Luigi Bianchi, and Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro./nIn 1875, Klein married Anne Hegel, granddaughter of the philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.[5]/nAfter spending five years at the Technische Hochschule, Klein was appointed to a chair of geometry at Leipzig University. His colleagues included Walther von Dyck, Rohn, Eduard Study and Friedrich Engel. Klein's years at Leipzig, 1880 to 1886, fundamentally changed his life. In 1882, his health collapsed and he battled with depression for the next two years.[6] Nevertheless, his research continued; his seminal work on hyperelliptic sigma functions, published between 1886 and 1888, dates from around this period./nKlein accepted a professorship at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in 1886. From then on, until his 1913 retirement, he sought to re-establish G\u00f6ttingen as the world's prime center for mathematics research. However, he never managed to transfer from Leipzig to G\u00f6ttingen his own leading role as developer of geometry. He taught a variety of courses at G\u00f6ttingen, mainly concerning the interface between mathematics and physics, in particular, mechanics and potential theory./nThe research facility Klein established at G\u00f6ttingen served as model for the best such facilities throughout the world. He introduced weekly discussion meetings, and created a mathematical reading room and library. In 1895, Klein recruited David Hilbert from the University of K\u00f6nigsberg. This appointment proved of great importance; Hilbert continued to enhance G\u00f6ttingen's primacy in mathematics until his own retirement in 1932./nUnder Klein's editorship, Mathematische Annalen became one of the best mathematical journals in the world. Founded by Clebsch, it grew under Klein's management, to rival,  and eventually surpass Crelle's Journal, based at the University of Berlin. Klein established a small team of editors who met regularly, making decisions in a democratic spirit. The journal first specialized in complex analysis, algebraic geometry, and invariant theory. It also provided an \nimportant outlet for real analysis and the new group theory./nIn 1893,  Klein was a major speaker at the International Mathematical Congress held in Chicago as part of the World's Columbian Exposition.[7] Due partly to Klein's efforts, G\u00f6ttingen began admitting women in 1893. He supervised the first Ph.D. thesis in mathematics written at G\u00f6ttingen by a woman, by Grace Chisholm Young, an English student of Arthur Cayley's, whom Klein admired. In 1897, Klein became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[8]/nAround 1900, Klein began to become interested in mathematical instruction in schools. In 1905, he was instrumental in formulating a plan recommending that analytic geometry, the rudiments of differential and integral calculus, and the function concept be taught in secondary schools.[9][10] This recommendation was gradually implemented in many countries around the world. In 1908, Klein was elected president of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction at the Rome International Congress of Mathematicians.[11] Under his guidance, the German part of the Commission published many volumes on the teaching of mathematics at all levels in Germany./nThe London Mathematical Society awarded Klein its De Morgan Medal in 1893. He was elected a member of the Royal Society in 1885, and was awarded its Copley Medal in 1912. He retired the following year due to ill health, but continued to teach mathematics at his home for several further years./nKlein was one of ninety-three signatories of the Manifesto of the Ninety-Three, a document penned in support of the German invasion of Belgium in the early stages of World War I./nHe died in G\u00f6ttingen in 1925./nKlein's dissertation, on line geometry and its applications to mechanics, classified second degree line complexes using Weierstrass's theory of elementary divisors./nKlein's first important mathematical discoveries were made in 1870. In collaboration with Sophus Lie, he discovered the fundamental properties of the asymptotic lines on the Kummer surface. They later investigated W-curves, curves invariant under a group of projective transformations. It was Lie who introduced Klein to the concept of group, which was to have a major role in his later work. Klein also learned about groups from Camille Jordan.[12]/nKlein devised the \"Klein bottle\" named after him, a one-sided closed surface which cannot be embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space, but it may be immersed as a cylinder looped back through itself to join with its other end from the \"inside\". It may be embedded in the Euclidean space of dimensions 4 and higher. The concept of a Klein Bottle was devised as a 3-Dimensional M\u00f6bius strip, with one method of construction being the attachment of the edges of two M\u00f6bius strips.[13]/nDuring the 1890s, Klein began studying mathematical physics more intensively, writing on the gyroscope with Arnold Sommerfeld.[14] During 1894, he initiated the idea of an encyclopedia of mathematics including its applications, which became the Encyklop\u00e4die der mathematischen Wissenschaften. This enterprise, which endured until 1935, provided an important standard reference of enduring value.[15]/nIn 1871, while at G\u00f6ttingen, Klein made major discoveries in geometry. He published two papers On the So-called Non-Euclidean Geometry showing that Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries could be considered metric spaces determined by a Cayley\u2013Klein metric. This insight had the corollary that non-Euclidean geometry was consistent if and only if Euclidean geometry was, giving the same status to geometries Euclidean and non-Euclidean, and ending all controversy about non-Euclidean geometry. Arthur Cayley never accepted Klein's argument, believing it to be circular./nKlein's synthesis of geometry as the study of the properties of a space that is invariant under a given group of transformations, known as the Erlangen program (1872), profoundly influenced the evolution of mathematics. This program was initiated by Klein's inaugural lecture as professor at Erlangen, although it was not the actual speech he gave on the occasion. The program proposed a unified system of geometry that has become the accepted modern method. Klein showed how the essential properties of a given geometry could be represented by the group of transformations that preserve those properties. Thus the program's definition of geometry encompassed both Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry./nCurrently, the significance of Klein's contributions to geometry is evident. They have become so much part of mathematical thinking that it is difficult to appreciate their novelty when first presented, and understand the fact that they were not immediately accepted by all his contemporaries./nKlein saw his work on complex analysis as his major contribution to mathematics, specifically his work on:/nKlein showed that the modular group moves the fundamental region of the complex plane so as to tessellate the plane. In 1879, he examined the action of PSL(2,7), considered as an image of the modular group, and obtained an explicit representation of a Riemann surface now termed the Klein quartic. He showed that it  was a complex curve in projective space, that its equation was x3y\u00a0+\u00a0y3z\u00a0+\u00a0z3x\u00a0=\u00a00, and that its group of symmetries was PSL(2,7) of order 168. His Ueber Riemann's Theorie der algebraischen Funktionen und ihre Integrale (1882) treats complex analysis in a geometric way, connecting potential theory and conformal mappings. This work drew on notions from fluid dynamics./nKlein considered equations of degree > 4, and was especially interested in using transcendental methods to solve the general equation of the fifth degree. Building on methods of Charles Hermite and Leopold Kronecker, he produced similar results to those of Brioschi and later completely solved the problem by means of the icosahedral group. This work enabled him to write a series of papers on elliptic modular functions./nIn his 1884 book on the icosahedron, Klein established a theory of automorphic functions, associating algebra and geometry. Poincar\u00e9 had published an outline of his theory of automorphic functions in 1881, which resulted in a friendly rivalry between the two men. Both sought to state and prove a grand uniformization theorem that would establish the new theory more completely. Klein succeeded in formulating such a theorem and in describing a strategy for proving it. He came up with his proof during an asthma attack at 2:30 A.M. on 23 March 1882.[16]/nKlein summarized his work on automorphic and elliptic modular functions in a four volume treatise, written with Robert Fricke over a period of about 20 years.", "18654117": "Li Jianshu (simplified Chinese: \u52b1\u5efa\u4e66; traditional Chinese: \u52f5\u5efa\u66f8; born 1959), also known as Jian-Shu Li, is a Chinese mathematician working in representation theory and automorphic forms.

The lucidity with which he rendered the terse Sanskrit of Mah\u0101v\u012bra is worth emulating by every modern translator of scientific texts. His way of handling mathematical rules or examples containing large numbers - some examples have as many as 36 digits - is unrivaled even in Sanskrit. He abridged the material of the Sanskrit original at certain places and expanded at others. Thus while Ga\u1e47itas\u0101rasan\u0304graha contains five methods of squaring and seven of cubing, the Telugu version has only one each and avoids all algebraic methods. Mallana also employs units of measure that were prevalent in the Andhra region of his time. Another innovation or addition in Telugu version pertains to mathematics proper. There are 45 additional examples under multiplication and 21 under division, which are not found in Sanskrit. All these examples have one common feature: to produce numbers containing a symmetric arrangement of digits.[5]/n/nThis article about an Indian scientist is a stub.

Her main contributions to astronomy were works on stellar occultations by the moon, measures of double stars and astrometric measurements, as well as the determination of the passage of stars through two verticals. She accomplished all of this while she was working at the Observatory of the University of Santiago de Compostela (USC).[1]/nBefore the Spanish Civil War, she obtained degrees in chemistry and pharmacy from the USC, earned her teaching diploma and studied Exact Sciences, the name for mathematics, for two years. She obtained her degree in mathematics in the Complutense University of Madrid some years later.[2]/nIn 1963 she became the first Spanish woman to defend a thesis that addressed the issue of astronomy: Observaciones de pasos por dos verticales (in English, Observations of passages of stars through two verticals). This thesis was also the first defended in the Faculty of Mathematics of the USC.[3]/nEconomic hardship forced her to study and work at the same time, but she earned scholarships that helped her reach her academic goals.[2]/nAntonia Ferr\u00edn Moreiras was born in Ourense on 13 May 1914, and was the third of four daughters. Contrary to the conventions of the time, and despite the limited economic resources of the family, her father, a mathematics teacher,[3] wanted all his daughters\u00a0\u2013 Antonia, Celsa, Mar\u00eda and Pastora, to have access to higher-level studies,[2] so the family moved to Santiago de Compostela in 1920.[1]/nFerr\u00edn started school when she was seven years old and at only nine years old, she was ready to start high school. She did the Scientific Bachillerato, which is the stage of education for people over the age of 16 in Spain.[4] After that, she studied the University Bachillerato, since admission to the university required the completion of this education stage, with twelve other girls.[citation needed]/nFerrin started her higher education studies in the Faculty of Sciences of the USC, at a time when chemistry was the only major offered. Even though her father worked in the Faculty of Pharmacy, his income was not enough, so she obtained free tuition and scholarships.[3] With such financial support, she could earn a degree in chemistry and the title of Schoolteacher in 1935.[2]/nShe started working immediately after she graduated, but her first jobs were not paid. From 1934 to 1936, Ferr\u00edn worked as training assistant teacher of physics and mathematics in the Faculty of Sciences of the USC and as temporary assistant teacher in the Department of Science of the high school Arcebispo Xelm\u00edrez in Santiago de Compostela.[3] At the same time, she was pursuing a pharmacy degree and the only two courses of Exact Sciences that the USC offered. In 1937, she started working as mathematics teacher in the orphan girls' school Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de los Remedios, a position she held until 1948.[1]/nIn 1937, after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she was sanctioned because of her political convictions,[2] and an anonymous complaint lead to the opening of her file.[3] As a result, she was removed from her duties as university teacher along with 45 other teachers. In 1940, however, she got her case reviewed, the sentence was revoked and she could teach again. After her removal, she restarted teaching at the university and sometimes she gave lessons in the girls' school until 1961.[2]/nDuring the academic year 1939\u20131940, Ferrin completed the prerequisite courses for the pharmacy degree. It was during this time that she met Ram\u00f3n Mar\u00eda Aller,[3] the founder and director of the Astronomical Observatory of the USC,[5] and the person who made it possible for her to become the first female Galician astronomer.[6] In that observatory, Ferr\u00edn started to use the passage instrument and the 12\u00a0cm (4.7\u00a0in) refracting telescope, which allowed her to visualize the concealment of stars by the moon, the passage of stars through two verticals, or micrometric measurements of double stars. The results of these investigations were published in the Spanish magazine of astronomy, Urania.[1] Ferr\u00edn recalled anecdotally that it was really cold while she was doing her research in the observatory. She never wore trousers because, according to her, it was a piece of clothing that \"was not considered feminine and only the more daring movie actresses wore them on the big screen.\"[6]/nIn 1950, she received a scholarship from the Spanish National Research Council to conduct research in the Astronomical Observatory of Santiago. This scholarship became a contract of research assistantship two years later.[3] In the same year, she obtained a degree in mathematics from the Complutense University of Madrid, even though she was a guest student for the last three courses of the degree.[2]/nIn 1953, she passed the civil service examinations for professor of mathematics in the Escuela de Magisterio of Santander.[7] However, two years later, she transferred to the girls' school Isabel la Cat\u00f3lica of Santiago.[3]/nFrom 1954 until 1956 she studied to earn a doctorate in astronomy in Madrid. In the meantime, she helped professor Vidal Abascal to create the degree in mathematics in the Faculty of Sciences of the USC, a feat accomplished in 1957.[7] Ferr\u00edn became the first female professor of this faculty.[1] During this time, she continued her research under the direction of Ram\u00f3n Mar\u00eda Aller./nThe thesis that she defended in 1963 with the help of Aller, even though he was 80 years old, was probably her greatest accomplishment[3] not only because it was the first read in the Faculty of Mathematics of the USC,[8] but also the first one defended by a woman addressing the issue of astronomy in Spain.[9] In 1963, she was appointed as full-time professor of mathematics in the Escuela de Magisterio Santa Mar\u00eda in Madrid and she also worked as professor of mathematics in the degree of medicine for two years.[3] In addition, she taught astronomy and celestial mechanics,[10] she served in management, and sat on the selection boards. She also participated in the first international meetings of mathematics that were carried out in Spain.[3]/nHowever, in spite of her great professional career, being a woman sometimes stood in the way of her aspirations. For example, when Aller got sick in 1964, a substitute was needed so that Aller's chair of astronomy in the observatory could continue. Even though she applied for the public examination, she was excluded. She was considered as an applicant following a complaint, but the chair was declared void and the observatory deteriorated.[8]/nFerr\u00edn retired in 1984.[11]/nOn 24 May 2008, she was proclaimed as the patroness of the fiftieth anniversary of the Faculty of Mathematics of the USC.[10]", "11772883": "Andr\u00e9 Bloch (20 November 1893 \u2013 11 October 1948) was a French mathematician who is best remembered for his fundamental contribution to complex analysis./nBloch killed three of his family members, for which he was institutionalized in a mental asylum for 31 years, during which all of his mathematical output was produced.[1]/nBloch was born in 1893 in Besan\u00e7on, France.  According to one of his teachers, Georges Valiron, both Andr\u00e9 Bloch and his younger brother Georges were in the same class in October 1910.  Valiron believed Georges to have the better talent, and due to lack of preparation, Andr\u00e9 finished last in the class.  Andr\u00e9 was spared from failing the class by convincing Ernest Vessiot to give him an oral exam. The exam convinced Vessiot of Andre's talent and both Andr\u00e9 and Georges entered the \u00c9cole Polytechnique.[2][3]/nBoth brothers served for a year in the military prior to World War I.[4]  Both Andr\u00e9 and Georges studied for only one year at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique before the outbreak of the war.[4]/nUpon the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Andr\u00e9 and Georges Bloch were drafted. Andr\u00e9, as a second-lieutenant in the artillery, was assigned to the headquarters of General de Castelnau in Nancy.[4]/nBoth Bloch brothers were injured: Andr\u00e9 suffered a fall from an observation post, while Georges sustained a head wound which cost him an eye.[4] Georges was released from service and returned to the \u00c9cole Polytechnique on 7 October 1917.[3] Andr\u00e9, however, was allowed to convalesce but not released from duty./nOn 17 November 1917, while on convalescent leave from service in World War I, Bloch killed his brother Georges and his aunt and uncle.[1] Several conjectures about the motives for Bloch's crime exist among mathematicians.[5] However, Cartan and Ferrand quote Henri Baruk, who was the medical head of the asylum where Bloch was confined. Bloch told Baruk that the murders were a eugenic act, in order to eliminate branches of his family affected by mental illness.[4]/nAfter the murders, Bloch was committed to the asylum at Charenton in Saint Maurice,[4] a suburb of Paris. Bloch continued his mathematical career while confined. All of his publications, including those relating to Bloch's constant, were written while he was committed. Bloch corresponded with several\nmathematicians, including Georges Valiron, George P\u00f3lya, Jacques Hadamard and others,[4] giving his return address as only \"57 Grande rue, Saint-Maurice\", never mentioning that this was a psychiatric hospital. Several of his correspondents were thus unaware of his confinement.[4]/nDuring the German occupation of France, Bloch (who was Jewish) wrote under aliases, in order to avoid advertising his presence to Nazi occupiers. In particular, Bloch is known to have authored papers under the names of Ren\u00e9 Binaud and Marcel Segond during this time.[3]/nAccording to P\u00f3lya, Bloch had the habit of dating his letters with 1 April,[3] regardless of when they were written./nBloch was transferred to the Sainte-Anne Hospital in Paris on 21 August 1948 for an operation. He died from leukemia in Paris on 11 October 1948.[4]/nMost important works of Bloch belong to complex analysis./nHis early contribution is known as Bloch's theorem. This theorem asserts the existence of a certain absolute constant which is called the Bloch constant. The exact value of the Bloch constant is still unknown as of 2021[update]. Research originating from this theorem led to introduction of Bloch's functions which form the so-called Bloch space. (This usage should not be confused with Bloch's functions of Swiss physicist Felix Bloch.)/nBloch formulated two important philosophical principles which proved to be useful in research in complex analysis. The more famous of these two is the so-called Bloch's principle.[6]\nIn Bloch's own words it is formulated (in Latin) as follows:\n\"Nihil est in infinito quod non prius fuerit in finito\", translated as \"There is nothing in the infinite that did not exist before in the finite\". Guided by this principle, Bloch was able to discover several important facts which were later proved by other mathematicians, for example, the five-island theorem. There is an intensive current research related to Bloch's principle./nBloch's ideas stimulated much of the research on holomorphic curves in the 20th century and remain central in this subfield. He stated a fundamental theorem on holomorphic curves in complex manifolds whose irregularity exceeds dimension.[7] (This can be considered as a deep and far-reaching generalization of Picard's theorem.) His proof of this theorem contained gaps (which he recognized), and later the theorem was known as \"Bloch's conjecture\". Bloch's conjecture, as stated, was proved by Takushiro Ochiai, Pit Man Wong, and simultaneously by Yujiro Kawamata in 1980,[8] and the related research started a new area which is called holomorphic curves in Abelian varieties (and semi-Abelian varieties)./nBloch was the first (jointly with P\u00f3lya) to consider the distribution of roots of random polynomials,[9] which is another area of research which is intensively developing\nsince the middle of 20th century.", "70886359": "Bentsion Fleishman (\u0424\u043b\u0435\u0439\u0448\u043c\u0430\u043d, \u0411\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d \u0428\u0438\u043c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447, born 21 November 1923) is a Russian scientist in the field of mathematical statistics, combinatorial analysis and their applications, doctor of physical and mathematical sciences, professor, author of constructive information theory and the theory of potential efficiency./nFleishman was born in Moscow.

In the field of real analysis, he is mostly known for the first rigorous formulation of the integral, the Riemann integral, and his work on Fourier series. His contributions to complex analysis include most notably the introduction of Riemann surfaces, breaking new ground in a natural, geometric treatment of complex analysis. His 1859 paper on the prime-counting function, containing the original statement of the Riemann hypothesis, is regarded as a foundational paper of analytic number theory. Through his pioneering contributions to differential geometry, Riemann laid the foundations of the mathematics of general relativity.[3] He is considered by many to be one of the greatest mathematicians of all time.[4][5]/nRiemann was born on 17 September 1826 in Breselenz, a village near Dannenberg in the Kingdom of Hanover. His father, Friedrich Bernhard Riemann, was a poor Lutheran pastor in Breselenz who fought in the Napoleonic Wars. His mother, Charlotte Ebell, died before her children had reached adulthood. Riemann was the second of six children, shy and suffering from numerous nervous breakdowns. Riemann exhibited exceptional mathematical talent, such as calculation abilities, from an early age but suffered from timidity and a fear of speaking in public./nDuring 1840, Riemann went to Hanover to live with his grandmother and attend lyceum (middle school years). After the death of his grandmother in 1842, he attended high school at the Johanneum L\u00fcneburg. In high school, Riemann studied the Bible intensively, but he was often distracted by mathematics. His teachers were amazed by his ability to perform complicated mathematical operations, in which he often outstripped his instructor's knowledge.  In 1846, at the age of 19, he started studying philology and Christian theology in order to become a pastor and help with his family's finances./nDuring the spring of 1846, his father, after gathering enough money, sent Riemann to the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where he planned to study towards a degree in theology. However, once there, he began studying mathematics under Carl Friedrich Gauss (specifically his lectures on the method of least squares). Gauss recommended that Riemann give up his theological work and enter the mathematical field; after getting his father's approval, Riemann transferred to the University of Berlin in 1847.[6] During his time of study, Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, Jakob Steiner, and Gotthold Eisenstein were teaching. He stayed in Berlin for two years and returned to G\u00f6ttingen in 1849./nRiemann held his first lectures in 1854, which founded the field of Riemannian geometry and thereby set the stage for Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity.[7] In 1857, there was an attempt to promote Riemann to extraordinary professor status at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. Although this attempt failed, it did result in Riemann finally being granted a regular salary. In 1859, following the death of Dirichlet (who held Gauss's chair at the University of G\u00f6ttingen), he was promoted to head the mathematics department at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. He was also the first to suggest using dimensions higher than merely three or four in order to describe physical reality.[8][7]/nIn 1862 he married Elise Koch; their daughter Ida Schilling who was born on 22 December 1862.[9]/nRiemann fled G\u00f6ttingen when the armies of Hanover and Prussia clashed there in 1866.[10] He died of tuberculosis during his third journey to Italy in Selasca (now a hamlet of Verbania on Lake Maggiore) where he was buried in the cemetery in Biganzolo (Verbania)./nRiemann was a dedicated Christian, the son of a Protestant minister, and saw his life as a mathematician as another way to serve God. During his life, he held closely to his Christian faith and considered it to be the most important aspect of his life. At the time of his death, he was reciting the Lord's Prayer with his wife and died before they finished saying the prayer.[11] Meanwhile, in G\u00f6ttingen his housekeeper discarded some of the papers in his office, including much-unpublished work. Riemann refused to publish incomplete work, and some deep insights may have been lost.[10]/nRiemann's tombstone in Biganzolo (Italy) refers to Romans 8:28:[12]/nGeorg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann\nProfessor in G\u00f6ttingen\nborn in Breselenz, 17 September 1826\ndied in Selasca, 20 July 1866/nRiemann's published works opened up research areas combining analysis with geometry. These would subsequently become major parts of the theories of Riemannian geometry, algebraic geometry, and complex manifold theory. The theory of Riemann surfaces was elaborated by Felix Klein and particularly Adolf Hurwitz. This area of mathematics is part of the foundation of topology and is still being applied in novel ways to mathematical physics./nIn 1853, Gauss asked Riemann, his student, to prepare a Habilitationsschrift on the foundations of geometry. Over many months, Riemann developed his theory of higher dimensions and delivered his lecture at G\u00f6ttingen in 1854 entitled Ueber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen.[13][14] It was not published until twelve years later in 1868 by Dedekind, two years after his death. Its early reception appears to have been slow, but it is now recognized as one of the most important works in geometry./nThe subject founded by this work is Riemannian geometry. Riemann found the correct way to extend into n dimensions the differential geometry of surfaces, which Gauss himself proved in his theorema egregium. The fundamental objects are called the Riemannian metric and the Riemann curvature tensor. For the surface (two-dimensional) case, the curvature at each point can be reduced to a number (scalar), with the surfaces of constant positive or negative curvature being models of the non-Euclidean geometries./nThe Riemann metric is a collection of numbers at every point in space (i.e., a tensor) which allows measurements of speed in any trajectory, whose integral gives the distance between the trajectory's endpoints. For example, Riemann found that in four spatial dimensions, one needs ten numbers at each point to describe distances and curvatures on a manifold, no matter how distorted it is./nIn his dissertation, he established a geometric foundation for complex analysis through Riemann surfaces, through which multi-valued functions like the logarithm (with infinitely many sheets) or the square root (with two sheets) could become one-to-one functions. Complex functions are harmonic functions[citation needed] (that is, they satisfy Laplace's equation and thus the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations) on these surfaces and are described by the location of their singularities and the topology of the surfaces. The topological \"genus\" of the Riemann surfaces is given by \n\n\n\ng\n=\nw\n\n/\n\n2\n\u2212\nn\n+\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g=w/2-n+1}\n\n, where the surface has \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n leaves coming together at \n\n\n\nw\n\n\n{\\displaystyle w}\n\n branch points. For \n\n\n\ng\n>\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g>1}\n\n the Riemann surface has \n\n\n\n(\n3\ng\n\u2212\n3\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (3g-3)}\n\n parameters (the \"moduli\")./nHis contributions to this area are numerous. The famous Riemann mapping theorem says that a simply connected domain in the complex plane is \"biholomorphically equivalent\" (i.e. there is a bijection between them that is holomorphic with a holomorphic inverse) to either \n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} }\n\n or to the interior of the unit circle. The generalization of the theorem to Riemann surfaces is the famous uniformization theorem, which was proved in the 19th century by Henri Poincar\u00e9 and Felix Klein. Here, too, rigorous proofs were first given after the development of richer mathematical tools (in this case, topology). For the proof of the existence of functions on Riemann surfaces, he used a minimality condition, which he called the Dirichlet principle. Karl Weierstrass found a gap in the proof: Riemann had not noticed that his working assumption (that the minimum existed) might not work; the function space might not be complete, and therefore the existence of a minimum was not guaranteed. Through the work of David Hilbert  in the Calculus of Variations, the Dirichlet principle was finally established. Otherwise, Weierstrass was very impressed with Riemann, especially with his theory of abelian functions. When Riemann's work appeared, Weierstrass withdrew his paper from Crelle's Journal and did not publish it. They had a good understanding when Riemann visited him in Berlin in 1859. Weierstrass encouraged his student Hermann Amandus Schwarz to find alternatives to the Dirichlet principle in complex analysis, in which he was successful. An anecdote from Arnold Sommerfeld[15] shows the difficulties which contemporary mathematicians had with Riemann's new ideas. In 1870, Weierstrass had taken Riemann's dissertation with him on a holiday to Rigi and complained that it was hard to understand. The physicist Hermann von Helmholtz assisted him in the work overnight and returned with the comment that it was \"natural\" and \"very understandable\"./nOther highlights include his work on abelian functions and theta functions on Riemann surfaces. Riemann had been in a competition with Weierstrass since 1857 to solve the Jacobian inverse problems for abelian integrals, a generalization of elliptic integrals. Riemann used theta functions in several variables and reduced the problem to the determination of the zeros of these theta functions. Riemann also investigated period matrices and characterized them through the \"Riemannian period relations\" (symmetric, real part negative). By Ferdinand Georg Frobenius and Solomon Lefschetz the validity of this relation is equivalent with the embedding of \n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n/\n\n\u03a9\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} ^{n}/\\Omega }\n\n (where \n\n\n\n\u03a9\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Omega }\n\n is the lattice of the period matrix) in a projective space by means of theta functions. For certain values of \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n, this is the Jacobian variety of the Riemann surface, an example of an abelian manifold./nMany mathematicians such as Alfred Clebsch furthered Riemann's work on algebraic curves. These theories depended on the properties of a function defined on Riemann surfaces. For example, the Riemann\u2013Roch theorem (Roch was a student of Riemann) says something about the number of linearly independent differentials (with known conditions on the zeros and poles) of a Riemann surface./nAccording to Detlef Laugwitz,[16] automorphic functions appeared for the first time in an essay about the Laplace equation on electrically charged cylinders. Riemann however used such functions for conformal maps (such as mapping topological triangles to the circle) in his 1859 lecture on hypergeometric functions or in his treatise on minimal surfaces./nIn the field of real analysis, he discovered the Riemann integral in his habilitation. Among other things, he showed that every piecewise continuous function is integrable. Similarly, the Stieltjes integral goes back to the G\u00f6ttinger mathematician, and so they are named together the Riemann\u2013Stieltjes integral./nIn his habilitation work on Fourier series, where he followed the work of his teacher Dirichlet, he showed that Riemann-integrable functions are \"representable\" by Fourier series. Dirichlet has shown this for continuous, piecewise-differentiable functions (thus with countably many non-differentiable points). Riemann gave an example of a Fourier series representing a continuous, almost nowhere-differentiable function, a case not covered by Dirichlet.  He also proved the Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma: if a function is representable by a Fourier series, then the Fourier coefficients go to zero for large\u00a0n./nRiemann's essay was also the starting point for Georg Cantor's work with Fourier series, which was the impetus for set theory./nHe also worked with hypergeometric differential equations in 1857 using complex analytical methods and presented the solutions through the behaviour of closed paths about singularities (described by the monodromy matrix). The proof of the existence of such differential equations by previously known monodromy matrices is one of the Hilbert problems./nRiemann made some famous contributions to modern analytic number theory. In a single short paper, the only one he published on the subject of number theory, he investigated the zeta function that now bears his name, establishing its importance for understanding the distribution of prime numbers. The Riemann hypothesis was one of a series of conjectures he made about the function's properties./nIn Riemann's work, there are many more interesting developments. He proved the functional equation for the zeta function (already known to Leonhard Euler), behind which a theta function lies. Through the summation of this approximation function over the non-trivial zeros on the line with real portion 1/2, he gave an exact, \"explicit formula\" for \n\n\n\n\u03c0\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\pi (x)}\n\n./nRiemann knew of Pafnuty Chebyshev's work on the Prime Number Theorem.

His terrestrial and celestial globes, first published in 1592, were the first to be made in England and the first to be made by an Englishman./nMolyneux was known as a mathematician and maker of mathematical instruments such as compasses and hourglasses. He became acquainted with many prominent men of the day, including the writer Richard Hakluyt and the mathematicians Robert Hues and Edward Wright. He also knew the explorers Thomas Cavendish, Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh and John Davis. Davis probably introduced Molyneux to his own patron, the London merchant William Sanderson, who largely financed the construction of the globes. When completed, the globes were presented to Elizabeth I. Larger globes were acquired by royalty, noblemen and academic institutions, while smaller ones were purchased as practical navigation aids for sailors and students. The globes were the first to be made in such a way that they were unaffected by the humidity at sea, and they came into general use on ships./nMolyneux emigrated to Amsterdam with his wife in 1596 or 1597. He succeeded in interesting the States-General, the parliament of the United Provinces, in a cannon he had invented, but he died suddenly in June 1598, apparently in poverty. The globe-making industry in England died with him./nOnly six of his globes are believed still to be in existence. Three are in England, of which one pair consisting of a terrestrial and a celestial globe is owned by Middle Temple and displayed in its library, while a terrestrial globe is at Petworth House in Petworth, West Sussex./nEmery Molyneux is regarded as the maker of the first terrestrial and celestial globes in England and as the first English globe-maker.[1] Little is known about the man himself. Petruccio Ubaldini, an Italian calligraphist, illuminator and ambassador[2] who was acquainted with him, said he was \"of obscure and humble family background\".[3] It seems likely that he was the \"Emery Molynox\" who was presented to the Worshipful Company of Stationers as the apprentice of one William Cooke in October 1557.[4] By the 1580s he had a workshop in Lambeth, on the south bank of the Thames, and enjoyed a reputation as a mathematician and maker of mathematical instruments.[5] Richard Polter, in his book The Pathway to Perfect Sayling (1605),[6] mentioned that Molyneux had been a skilful maker of compasses and hourglasses.[7]/nThrough his trade, Molyneux was known to the explorers Thomas Cavendish, John Davis, Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh, the writer Richard Hakluyt, and the mathematicians Robert Hues and Edward Wright.[5] The construction of globes by Molyneux appears to have been suggested by Davis to his patron William Sanderson, a London merchant who has been described as \"one of the most munificent and patriotic of merchant-princes of London in the days of Elizabeth I\".[5] Sanderson readily agreed to bear the manufacturing costs,[5] and financed initial production of the globes with a capital investment of \u00a31,000[8] (almost \u00a3160,000 as of 2007).[9]/nIn making his terrestrial globes, Molyneux examined ruttiers (instructions for directions at sea)[10] and pilots (navigational handbooks).[11] He is known to have given a ruttier for Brazil and the West Indies to Thomas Harriot in 1590.[7][12] He also received advice and assistance from navigators and mathematicians.[13] It is likely, for instance, that Sir Walter Raleigh advised him on a legend in Spanish about the Solomon Islands that appeared on the terrestrial globe.[14] Raleigh came by the information from Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, a Galician explorer sent by King Philip II of Spain to fortify the Strait of Magellan after Francis Drake had passed through it. In 1584, the Spaniard was Raleigh's guest in London for a few weeks, after being captured by Raleigh on a journey to Europe.[15]/nMolyneux accompanied Francis Drake on his 1577\u20131580 circumnavigation of the world; as Ubaldini reported, \"[h]e himself has been in those seas and on those coasts in the service of the same Drake\".[3] A legend in Latin on the terrestrial globe, explaining why Molyneux had left out the polar lands and corrected the distance across the Atlantic Ocean between The Lizard and Cape Race in Newfoundland, concluded:/nQuod equide[m] effeci tu[m] ex meis navigationibus primo, tum deinceps ex felici illa sub clariss. Fran. Drako ad Indos Occident, expeditione, in qua non-modo optimas quasqu[e] alioru[m] descriptiones, sed quidquid mea quantulacu[m]que, vel scie[n]ta vel experientia ad integru[m] hoc qui[n]quen[n]io pr[a]estare potuit, ad hujus operis perfectione[m] co[m]paravi ... [I have been able to do this both in the first place from my own voyages and secondly from that successful expedition to the West Indies under the most illustrious Francis Drake: in which expedition I have put together not only all the best delineations of others, but everything my own humble knowledge or experience has been able to furnish in the last five years to the perfecting of this work.][16]/nOn the terrestrial globe, tracks of the voyages of Francis Drake and Thomas Cavendish around the world are marked by red and blue lines respectively. These lines were applied when the globe was first made. They are mentioned in a description of Molyneux's globes in Blundeville His Exercises (1594)[17][18] by Thomas Blundeville, a country gentleman who was an enthusiastic student of astronomy and navigation.[19] Thomas Cavendish appears to have helped Molyneux with his globes, and it is possible that Molyneux accompanied him on his 1587 voyage around the world, which returned to England on 9 September 1588.[7] In 1889, Sir Clements Markham, an English explorer, author and geographer, pointed out that a Latin legend on the terrestrial globe, placed off the Patagonian coast, states: \"Thomas Caundish 18 Dec. 1587 h\u00e6c terra sub nostris oculis primum obtulit sub latitud 47 cujus seu admodum salubris Incol\u00e6 maturi ex parte proceri sunt gigantes et vasti magnitudinis\".[20] However, Helen Wallis, former Map Curator of the British Library, observed in 1951 that this was unlikely, because Molyneux incorrectly plotted Cavendish's course in Maritime Southeast Asia.[21] She suggested, however, that another legend on the globe may indicate that he sailed on at least one if not all of John Davis's voyages.[22]/nThe mathematician and cartographer Edward Wright[23] assisted Molyneux in plotting coastlines on the terrestrial globe and translated some of the legends into Latin. On 10 April 1591, the astrologer and physician Simon Forman visited Molyneux's workshop and taught him how to find longitude.[7] It appears that after Molyneux had prepared the manuscript gores (the flat map segments attached to the globes), he had them printed by the celebrated Flemish engraver and cartographer Jodocus Hondius, who lived in London between 1584 and 1593 to escape religious difficulties in Flanders. This can be deduced from the phrase \"Iodocus Hon: / dius Flan. sc. / 1592\" that appears on the celestial globe along with Sanderson's coat of arms and a dedication to the Queen dated 1592. Molyneux's own name is recorded on the Middle Temple terrestrial globe in the phrase \"Emerius Mulleneux Angl.' / sumptibus Gulielmi\u2014 / Sandersoni Londin\u0113: / sis descripsit\" (\"Emery Molyneux of England, at the expense of William Sanderson of London, described this\").[24]/nMolyneux's celestial globe was virtually a copy of Gerardus Mercator's globe of 1551, which itself was based on a globe of 1537 by Gemma Frisius that Mercator had helped to construct.[25] To the constellations featured on Mercator's globe, Molyneux added the Southern Cross and Southern Triangle, though somewhat to the west of their true positions. His source appears to have been Andrea Corsali's diagram of the Antarctic sky published[26] in 1550.[27]/nMolyneux's globes were the first to be constructed in such a way that they were unaffected by humidity at sea. They were made of flour-paste, an unusual material for the time. Simon Forman remarked that Molyneux's moulding or casting process was \"the only way to caste [anything] whatsoever in perfecte forme ... and yt is the perfectest and trewest waie of all wayes ... and this was the wai that Mullenax did use to cast flowere [flour] in the verie forme\".[7][28]/nIn 1589, Richard Hakluyt announced the forthcoming publication of Molyneux's terrestrial globe at the end of the preface to The Principall Navigations, Voiages and Discoveries of the English Nation.[29] Referring to the map that was inserted into the volume\u2014a reproduction of the \"Typus Orbis Terrarum\" engraved by Franciscus Hogenberg for Abraham Ortelius' Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (1570)[30]\u2014he wrote:/nI have contented myselfe with inserting into the worke one of the best generall mappes of the world onely, untill the comming out of a very large and most exact terrestriall globe, collected and reformed according to the newest, secretest, and latest discoveries, both Spanish, Portugall and English, composed by Mr. Emmerie Molineux of Lambeth, a rare Gentleman in his profession, being therin for divers yeeres, greatly supported by the purse and liberalitie of the worshipfull merchant M. William Sanderson.[31]/nUbaldini reported Molyneux's progress in manufacturing the globes to the Duke of Milan. He was in attendance when Molyneux presented a pair of manuscript globes to Elizabeth I at Greenwich in July 1591.[32] Ubaldini noted that \"he gave her the globe to let her see at a glance how much of the world she could control by means of her naval forces\".[2] According to Wallis, the printed globes, which at 2\u00a0feet 1\u00a0inch (0.64\u00a0m) in diameter were then the largest ever made,[33] were published after some delay in late 1592 or early 1593.[34] Sanderson arranged entertainments at his home in Newington Butts to mark the presentation of these globes to the Queen. His son William later reported the Queen's words on accepting the terrestrial globe: \"The whole earth, a present for a Prince ...\"; and on accepting the celestial globe, she said: \"Thou hast presented me with the Heavens also: God guide me, to Govern my part of the one, that I may enjoy but a mansion place in this other.\"[35] Elizabeth I saw globes and armillary spheres as symbols of her empire and spiritual mission on earth.[36] The royal coat of arms contained in Elizabeth I Privy Seal was emblazoned across North America on the terrestrial globe.[2][37]/nSeveral treatises were published to describe the Molyneux globes and provide guides on their use. Molyneux himself wrote a treatise, now lost, entitled The Globes Celestial and Terrestrial Set Forth in Plano, which Sanderson published in 1592.[7] In the same year, Thomas Hood, a London-based mathematics lecturer who had written a 1590 work on the use of celestial globes,[39] published The Vse of Both the Globes, Celestiall and Terrestriall.[40] This was followed in 1594 by two works, one of which was Blundeville's book. The other, Tractatus de Globis et Eorum Usu (Treatise on Globes and their Use),[41] was published by the mathematician Robert Hues.[42] This work went into at least 13 printings and was translated from Latin into Dutch, English and French. In 1599, Edward Wright published Certaine Errors in Navigation,[43] which included commentary on the use of the terrestrial and celestial globes developed by Molyneux./nAccording to Markham, \"the appearance of the globes naturally created a great sensation, and much interest was taken in appliances which were equally useful to the student and to the practical navigator.\"[13] The largest and most prestigious globes were priced at up to \u00a320 each: these were purchased by royalty, noblemen and academic institutions. Among the purchasers were Thomas Bodley and the Warden of All Souls College, for their libraries in Oxford. William Sanderson presented the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge with a pair each.[44] The public preacher Thomas Laughton made an inaugural gift of a Molyneux globe to the Shrewsbury School library.[45] Smaller globes were also made, though no examples have survived. Sanderson is known to have presented one of these to Robert Cecil in 1595, together with Hues' \"Latin booke that teacheth the use of my great globes\".[7][46] Intended as practical navigation aids, they cost as little as \u00a32.[7][47]/nThe globes provided navigators and students with methods for finding the place of the sun, latitude, course, distance, amplitudes, azimuths, time and declination. They proved such a boon to navigation that they came into widespread use on ships.[48] In the dedication of his 1595 book The Seamans Secrets[49] to the Lord High Admiral, Charles Howard, the 1st Earl of Nottingham, navigator John Davis spoke of \"the mechanical practices drawn from the Arts of Mathematick, [in which] our Country doth yield men of principal excellency\", and he noted \"Mr Emery Mullenenx for the exquisite making of Globes bodies\".[50]/nIn the 1590s, Molyneux sought Elizabeth I's patronage for the production of a cannon, which he described as his \"new invention, of shot and artillery, to be used principally in naval warfare: protection of ports and harbours, a new shot to discharge a thousand musket shot; with wildfire not to be quenched\".[51] In March 1593, Molyneux was issued with a royal warrant. Two years later, the merchant Robert Parkes purchased coal, saltpetre, pitch, oils and waxes for him, possibly for the cannon. On 4 November 1596 the Privy Council urged the Lord Admiral \"to speak to Molyneux, Bussy and the two Engelberts about their offensive engines\"[52] as part of measures to defend England's south coast. It appears the request was ignored. On 27 September 1594,[53] the Queen granted Molyneux a gift of \u00a3200 and an annuity of \u00a350. He chose to surrender the latter when, some time between March or April 1596 and 4 June 1597,[53] he and his wife Anne emigrated to Amsterdam, Holland.[7] Wallis has conjectured that he took with him the printing plates for the globes and sold them to Hondius, who had returned to Amsterdam in 1593.[54]/nWhy Molyneux left England for Holland is unclear. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography suggests it was to be able to personally distribute his globes to European princes, since Amsterdam was then quickly establishing itself as the centre of globe- and map-making.[7] However, this could not have been his intention if he had sold the globes' plates to Hondius. It is possible that he had decided to concentrate on manufacturing ordnance. On 26 January 1598, the States-General, the parliament of the United Provinces, showed interest in Molyneux's cannon and granted him a 12-year privilege on an invention. On 6 June he lodged a second application, but he died in Amsterdam almost immediately afterwards. His wife was granted administration of his estate in England later that month. It seems that Molyneux died in poverty, because Anne was granted a Dutch compassionate pension of 50 florins on 9 April 1599. Molyneux apparently had no other surviving family, and the English globe-making industry died with him.[7] No other globes appear to have been manufactured in England until the appearance in the 1670s of globes by Robert Morden and William Berry, and by Joseph Moxon.[55] However, over 40\u00a0years after Molyneux's death, William Sanderson the younger wrote that his globes were \"yet in being, great and small ones, Celestiall and Terrestriall, in both our Universities and severall Libraries (here, and beyond Seas)\".[56]/nIn the second volume of the greatly expanded version of his book The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation (1599),[57] Hakluyt published what is known today as the Wright\u2013Molyneux Map.[58] Created by Edward Wright and based on Molyneux's terrestrial globe, it was the first map to use Wright's improvements on Mercator's projection.[59]/nHaving, it is believed, purchased the plates of Molyneux's globes, Jodocus Hondius was granted a ten-year privilege on 1 April 1597 to make and publish a terrestrial globe. In that year, he produced in Amsterdam a Dutch translation of Hues' Tractatus de Globis.[60] On 31 October 1598, despite a legal challenge by rival globe-maker Jacob van Langeren, Hondius obtained another privilege for ten years.[61] He duly published globes in 1600 and 1601, and his sons Henricus and Jodocus published a pair in 1613. Hondius also published a world map in 1608 on the Mercator projection. Its reliance on the Molyneux globe is shown by a number of legends, names and outlines which must have been copied directly from it.[62]/nIn his globes of 1612, van Langeren incorporated the improvements made by Hondius the Elder to Molyneux's globe. It is believed that the Hondius globes also spurred Willem Blaeu to start constructing his large globes in 1616, which were published in 1622. Molyneux's globes therefore may have indirectly influenced the evolution of Dutch globe-making.[63]/nThe appearance of Molyneux's globes had a significant influence on the culture of his time. In Shakespeare's The Comedy of Errors, written between 1592 and 1594, one of the protagonists, Dromio of Syracuse, compares a kitchen maid to a terrestrial globe: \"No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip: she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out countries in her.\"[64] The jest gained its point from the publication of the globes; Shakespeare may even have seen them himself.[36] Elizabethan dramatist Thomas Dekker wrote in one of his plays published in The Gull's Horn-book (1609):[7]/nWhat an excellent workman, therefore, were he that could cast the globe of it into a new mould. And not to make it look like Molyneux his globe, with a round face sleeked and washed over with white of eggs, but have it in plano as it was at first, with all the ancient circles, lines, parallels and figures.[65]/nIt has been suggested that the Lord Chamberlain's Men, the playing company that Shakespeare worked for as an actor and playwright for most of his career, named their playing space the Globe Theatre, built in 1599, as a response to the growing enthusiasm for terrestrial and celestial globes stimulated by those of Molyneux.[66]/nIn Twelfth Night (1600\u20131601),[67] Shakespeare alluded to the Wright\u2013Molyneux Map when Maria says of Malvolio: \"He does smile his face into more lynes, than is in the new Mappe, with the augmentation of the Indies.\"[59]/nOnly six Molyneux globes are known to exist today, two terrestrial globes and four celestial globes. Three celestial globes are in Germany, one each in Zerbst, Nuremberg (at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum (German National Museum)) and Kassel (Hessisches Landesmuseum (Hesse Museum), Kassel). The Hessisches Landesmuseum once had a 1592 terrestrial globe, but it is believed to have been destroyed during World War II. Three globes remain in England: one pair, consisting of a terrestrial and a celestial globe, is owned by Middle Temple in London and displayed in its library, while a terrestrial globe is at Petworth House in Petworth, West Sussex.[68]/nA terrestrial globe was discovered in Lord Leconfield's library at Petworth House in Petworth, West Sussex, in July 1949.[69] According to the tradition of the Wyndham family, who are descended from Henry Percy, the 9th Earl of Northumberland, the globe belonged to Sir Walter Raleigh, who gave it to Northumberland when they were imprisoned together in the Tower of London. Northumberland, known as the \"Wizard Earl\" for his interest in scientific and alchemical experiments and his library,[70] was suspected of being involved in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 because his relative Thomas Percy was among the conspirators. James I imprisoned Raleigh in the Tower for his supposed involvement in the Main Plot. Although the theory is supported by circumstantial evidence, a number of entries in Northumberland's accounts relating to the mending of globes, one dating back to 1596, suggest that the Molyneux globe may have belonged to him from the beginning and was not Raleigh's.[71] The globe, however, almost certainly spent many years in the Tower before its transfer to Petworth House, where Northumberland was confined upon his release in 1621.[68]/nThe Petworth House globe, now in the North Gallery, is the only Molyneux terrestrial globe preserved in its original 1592 state. One of Molyneux's \"great globes\", measuring 2\u00a0feet 1\u00a0inch (0.64\u00a0m) in diameter, it was reported in 1952 to be in poor condition despite restoration by the British Museum the previous year.[68] The Northern Hemisphere was darkened by dirt and badly rubbed in places, to the extent that it was hard to read. Parts of it, and large sections of the Southern Hemisphere, are missing altogether.[72] The restoration work revealed that the globe is weighted with sand and made from layers of small pieces of paper overlaid with a coat of plaster about 1\u20448 inch (3\u00a0mm) thick. On top of this is another layer of paper over which the gores are pasted. The globe retains its wooden horizon circle and brass meridian ring, but its hour circle and index are missing.[73] Further restoration took place between 1995 and 1997.[74] The globe was exhibited at the Royal Geographical Society in 1951 and 1952.[68]/nA bill in the accounts of 11 April 1717 for \"repairing the globes in the library\"[75] is the earliest reference to the Middle Temple's ownership of the Molyneux terrestrial and celestial globes.[76] Markham's view was that Robert Ashley (1565\u20131641), a barrister of the Middle Temple who was also an ardent geographer, was likely to have left the globes to the Inn in his will, together with his books. Ashley's books formed the nucleus of the Inn's original library and included copies of the second edition of Hues' Tractatus de Globis and other works on cosmography.[77] On the other hand, Wallis has said that Markham's view is not supported by any available evidence and the globes are not mentioned in the will. She believes that they were probably acquired by Middle Temple on their publication in 1603.[78]/nThe celestial globe is dated 1592, but the terrestrial globe bears the year 1603 and is the only example of its kind.[34] Wallis has surmised that the globes were made by Hondius in Amsterdam in 1603 for a purchaser in England, perhaps the Middle Temple itself. The celestial globe was made from the original 1592 printing plates, while the terrestrial globe was produced using revised plates redated to 1603.[79] The Middle Temple terrestrial globe differs from the Petworth House globe of 1592 by incorporating Raleigh's discoveries in Guiana[80] and adding new place-names in Brazil, Peru and Africa, as well as an island marked \"Corea\" off the coast of China.[81] The most extensive revision altered the Northeast Passage to take account of discoveries made on Willem Barentsz's third voyage to Novaya Zemlya in 1596. It appears that the revisions to the original plates of Molyneux's globe were completed by 1597, because no discoveries after that year are included.[82] It is possible that Molyneux helped Hondius to update the plates in 1596 or 1597. For instance, if Hondius had obtained a copy of Raleigh's map of Guiana, Molyneux was the most likely source.[83] Unlike the Petworth House globe, the Middle Temple globes are heavily varnished. The varnish could have been first applied as early as 1818 when the globes were repaired by J. and W. Newton; they were certainly varnished by Messrs. Holland Hannen & Cubitts, Ltd. during maintenance work in 1930.[72]/nAt the start of World War II, the globes were sent to Beaconsfield and stored with part of the Wallace Collection at Hall Barn in the care of Lady Burnham. They were brought back to London in 1945 and were at one stage kept in the King's Library on loan to the British Museum.[68][84] The globes were installed in their present position in the Middle Temple Library when the current library building opened in 1958.[75] In 2003, they were loaned to the National Maritime Museum for an exhibition commemorating the life of Elizabeth I.[85]/nIn 2004, Middle Temple proposed selling the Molyneux globes, valued at over \u00a31\u00a0million, to create a scholarship fund for the education and training of needy would-be barristers. Its members eventually decided by a large majority against such a move. There was also a general feeling that the globes should be made more accessible to those wishing to see them.[86]/nThe Middle Temple's Molyneux globes are the subject of a book-length project, The Molyneux Globes: Mathematical Practice and Theory, by Lesley Cormack of the University of Alberta.[87] The project examines the community of mathematicians, natural philosophers, instrument-makers, and gentlemen-virtuosi that developed around the creation of the Molyneux globes, particularly the histories of four men who wrote treatises about the globes and the larger mathematical community.[88]/nThe Molyneux globes at the Hessisches Landesmuseum, Kassel, were inherited from the collection of William IV (William the Wise), the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), a pioneer of astronomical research. William himself died in 1592, so it has been surmised that his son and successor, Maurice, purchased the globes for the collection. They were first mentioned in 1765 in the index of the Mathematische Kammer (Mathematics Chamber) of the F\u00fcrstliches Kunsthaus (Princely Art Gallery) in Kassel, during the reign of Landgrave Frederick III.[89] Only a celestial globe survives today; it is believed that the terrestrial globe was destroyed during World War II.", "65315845": "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Bellosta-Baylet (1946 \u2013\u00a019 August 2011) was a French historian of mathematics specializing in mathematics in medieval Islam.[1]/nBellosta was a student at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de jeunes filles, and taught mathematics in the lyc\u00e9es for many years.

Unlike many previous works on the topic, it aims at encyclopedic coverage of women in mathematics in the pre-World War II United States, rather than focusing only on the biographies of individual women or on collecting stories of only the most famous women in mathematics.[2] The Basic Library List Committee of the Mathematical Association of America has strongly recommended its inclusion in undergraduate mathematics libraries.[3]/nThe first part of the book discusses the institutions that granted doctorates to women in mathematics before 1940, and the milieu in which they operated, including typical practices of the time of that demanded that women resign on marriage, that forbade institutions from hiring wives or other relatives of their male faculty,[3] or in some cases prevented women who had done all the work for a graduate degree from being granted one. It also discusses the patterns the authors' found in these women's lives,[4] including the discovery that their life expectancies were higher than typical for their time.[3][4] Its eight chapters include material on the family background of the subjects, their undergraduate and graduate education, hiring and careers, and their contributions to mathematics.[5][6]/nThe second part of the book provides biographical profiles of every woman that the authors could identify as having earned a doctorate in mathematics in the US before 1940,[3] as well as four American women who earned doctorates abroad, giving 228 in all.[2][4] The typical biography in this section is approximately 2/3 of a page to a page in length,[3][4][7] with information drawn from reference works, review journals, and archival material as well as interviews with the subjects still living at the time of the study.[2][7][6] The 1940 cutoff for the biographies in the book represents both a time of \"a precipitous drop in enrollment\" for women in mathematics, and the starting time for two previous studies on women in mathematics and science by Margaret A.

Largely self-taught, he was apprenticed to a cabinet-maker but soon abandoned his trade in favour of teaching and writing. He practised as an architect but is best remembered for his theoretical work on the skew arch (he never actually constructed one himself), his invention of draughtsman's instruments, including a centrolinead and a cyclograph, and his prolific writing on numerous practical subjects./nBorn in 1765 in the parish of Prestonkirk, East Lothian, Peter Nicholson was the son of a stonemason.[3]\nLargely self-taught and excelling in the field of mathematics, he received only a rudimentary formal education, studying under a Mr Richardson, brother of architect George Richardson, at the local parish school from the age of nine until he left, aged 12, to assist his father in the family business.[2] During this time he amused himself by making drawings and models of the numerous mills in the neighbourhood.[3] However, finding stonemasonry not to his liking, he expressed the desire to be a cabinet-maker and so served a four-year apprenticeship at Linton, the principal village in the parish, then worked as a journeyman in Edinburgh before leaving for London in 1789 at the age of 24.[1][4]/nLiving in London, Nicholson continued trading as a cabinet-maker but also began teaching practical geometry at an evening school for mechanical engineers in Berwick Street, Soho, at which he became so successful that he soon abandoned his trade and took up authorship.[2][4] He published his first book, The Carpenter's New Guide in 1792, illustrating it with plates engraved by his own hand.[1] It is notable for containing an original method for the construction of groins and niches of complex, double curved forms.[2] Whilst living in London, Nicholson published three more books, The Student's Instructor (1795), The Carpenter and Joiner's Assistant (1797), and a three-volume work entitled Principles of Architecture, which he began in 1794 but did not complete until 1798.[1]/nAfter living in London for 11 years, Nicholson returned to Scotland in 1800, at the age of 35, and spent the next eight years working as an architect in Glasgow, a city already rising to eminence, and to which he made a number of contributions, including a wooden bridge over the River Clyde, Carlton Place in Laurieston, and additions to the college buildings.[1][2][3] During this time Hugh Montgomerie, the 12th Earl of Eglinton commissioned him to prepare plans for the new town of Ardrossan in Ayrshire and for the next 50 years his simple but effective grid plan was adhered to.[4] The town's harbour was built under the direction of fellow Scot and celebrated engineer, Thomas Telford who was sufficiently impressed by Nicholson's work that he recommended him for the post of Surveyor to the county of Cumberland, on the death of the incumbent, John Chisholme in 1808.[4]/nSuccessfully securing the post, Nicholson relocated to Carlisle, where he supervised the construction of the new Courts of Justice to Telford's designs and received rewards from the Society for the Encouragement of the Useful Arts for improvements he made to the construction of handrailing and for his invention of a draughtsman's instrument called the centrolinead, before returning to London two years later, in order to resume his teaching and writing.[1][4]/nEstablishing a school in Oxford Street, Nicholson taught mathematics, architecture, surveying and building technology, and he continued to develop the centrolinead, in recognition of which he received the Gold Isis Medal and the sum of 20 shillings from the Society for the Encouragement of the Useful Arts in 1814, and a silver medal in 1815.[2][4] In c.\u20091816, he sat for portrait artist James Green, the painting being donated to the National Portrait Gallery in London in 1961.[5] The period between 1810 and 1829, during which Nicholson lived in London, was his most prolific as an author. During this time he published Mechanical Exercises (1812), The Builder and Workman's New Director (1822), and The Architectural Dictionary, in two volumes (1812 and 1819). This work was considered the most important of the numerous works that were to make his reputation as a national authority on building technology at a time when the building industry was changing rapidly under the influence of scientific research.[4] In addition to practical books relating to building and architecture, Nicholson also wrote about purely scientific, and sometimes rather esoteric subjects.[3] His Treatise on Practical Perspective (1815) included a discussion and full instructions on the use of the centrolinead, while his mathematical works included such titles as An Introduction to the Method of Increments (1817), Essays on the Combinatorial Analysis (1818), and The Rudiments of Algebra (1819). His Essay on Involution and Evolution (1820) earned him the commendation of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences in Paris.[6] In 1826, at the age of 61, Nicholson visited France and, by the time of his return, had gained sufficient familiarity with the language to be able to translate books on various mathematical subjects.[2] The following year, he began work on an ambitious project entitled The School of Architecture and Engineering, intending to complete it in 12 affordable volumes, costing just 1s 6d each, but he was forced to abandon the work when the publisher, J. and C. Adlard of London[7] was declared bankrupt and only five volumes were ever produced, this being the only project he left unfinished.[2][3] Suffering a heavy financial loss himself, and in order to economise, Nicholson left London for Morpeth in Northumberland in 1829, where he lived in a small property left to him by a relative.[4] In the meantime, he published A Popular and Practical Treatise on Masonry and Stone-cutting (1828), in which he solved the problem of cutting stones to the precise shapes required for the construction of a strong skew arch and presented his solution in a form that was useful to other engineers and stonemasons, enabling the stones to be prepared from templates at the quarry in advance of the actual construction of the bridge.[2]/nIn Morpeth, Nicholson started work on a book entitled A Treatise on Dialing in which he described how to prepare and erect sundials, as well as applying trigonometry to the problem of finding the length of the hip of a roof and its rafters from the angle of inclination of its eaves.[2] On 10 August 1832, Nicholson's wife, Jane died, aged 48, and he erected a neat memorial to her in the grounds of the High Church before leaving Morpeth and taking up residence in Carliol Street, Newcastle upon Tyne.[2]/nAt the age of 67, and still financially embarrassed, Nicholson resumed his writing, finally getting his Treatise on Dialing published in Newcastle in 1833, and set up a school in the recently opened Royal Arcade, which he ran for a few years, though it was not a financial success.[1][4] He was nevertheless highly regarded by the local people and was awarded honorary memberships of a number of local institutions, including the Newcastle Mechanics' Institute.[2] In 1834, an attempt was made to raise, by public subscription, sufficient funds to purchase an annuity for his benefit, but as only \u00a3320 was raised it was deemed insufficient for the purpose and was handed directly to Nicholson to help with his immediate needs, and a petition was sent to the king in an attempt to secure a pension for him from the Privy Purse.[1][2] In October 1836, he was elected President of the Newcastle Society for the Promotion of the Fine Arts[2] and in August 1838, he presented a paper entitled Principles of Oblique Bridges to the eighth meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, which was held in Newcastle.[8]\nDuring the nine years he lived in Newcastle, Nicholson published three more books, his Treatise on Projection (1837) containing his portrait, drawn from life by Edward Train, originally in pen and ink.[2] Nicholson's final work was entitled The Guide to Railway Masonry, containing a Complete Treatise on the Oblique Arch and published on 1 January 1839, the third edition of which also contained the portrait by Train.[2] The contrast between this and the earlier portrait by Green is marked: Green painted a man at the peak of his vigour, while Train drew a much older and poorer man.[2]/nLeaving Newcastle for Carlisle on 10 October 1841, aged 76, Nicholson was supported for the remainder of his life by the generosity of Thomas Jamieson, a relative by marriage, of Newton, Northumberland.[4] He died on 18 June 1844 and was buried in the graveyard of Christ Church, which was built in 1830 but has since been demolished.[9]\nA monument to his memory, designed by Robert William Billings in the form of a pair of interpenetrating obelisks, was erected in Carlisle cemetery in 1865.[4] Nicholson married twice. By his first wife, Jane he had one son, Michael Angelo, author of the Carpenter and Joiner's Companion (1826), who died in 1842, leaving a numerous family; by his second marriage, Nicholson had a daughter, Jessie, who married a Mr Bowen of Bridgewater, and a son, Jamieson T., both of whom survived him.[2][3]/nNicholson is variously described in his own books as architect, carpenter, surveyor, practical builder and private teacher of mathematics.[10]\nAs a mathematician, he was largely self-taught, later turning to architecture as a means of finding a practical application for the theoretical knowledge he had amassed during his solitary studies./nHaving by ardent desire, in early youth, acquired a knowledge of most of the Mathematical Sciences, by application to books, principally from the works of that celebrated mathematician, Mr. Emerson, but, from the want of similar society at that time, and a desire of applying the scientific knowledge I then possessed to useful purposes, I directed my attention to Architecture; and what I have done in this art will sufficiently appear in the works that have been published under my name./nFor his work on involution and evolution, Nicholson received the following commendation from the French Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences./nFrench Institute, Royal Academy of Sciences, Paris, 10 July 1820./nSir,\u2014The Academy has received with a lively degree of interest, the Essay that you obligingly addressed to it on Involution and Evolution, or a Method of determining the Numerical Value of any Function of an unknown Quantity.

In fact, your method renders the working of them nearly as simple as those of a common square arch. [...] I beg leave to thank you for the great pains you have taken in rendering the oblique arch practically easy to most capacities./nFollowing his 1836 publication On the Construction of Skew Arches,[14]\nCharles Fox openly acknowledged Nicholson's contribution while claiming his own to be the superior method./nNo one would for a moment hesitate to acknowledge the obligations which practical men are under to that highly talented individual Mr Peter Nicholson; but on referring to his Treatise on Masonry and Stone-cutting (plate 17) it will at once appear that the intrado is the only surface developed, and the approximate line laid down upon it, all the courses are drawn at right angles to that line; the courses therefore are drawn with reference to the intrado only./nIn his 1837 publication A Practical and Theoretical Essay on Oblique Bridges, George W. Buck also acknowledged Nicholson's contribution but, finding it lacking in detail, applied his own original trigonometrical approach and considerable practical experience to the problem./nIn Nicholson's work on stone cutting, published in 1828, the method of constructing oblique arches with spiral courses is briefly explained, and to it we are indebted for the first principles of the art, but it does not enter sufficiently into detail./nThe unfavourable comments from Fox and Buck were comparatively mild and tempered in part by their acknowledgement of Nicholson's pioneering work. Nevertheless, Nicholson, by this time in his mid-70s and his health failing, felt the need to exercise his right of reply.[17]\nA number of people expressed their public support for him, including his friend Henry Welch, the County Bridge Surveyor for Northumberland[18]\nand an anonymous supporter known only by the initials M.Q.[19]\nUnfortunately this exchange escalated into a paper war that became increasingly acrimonious,[20][21]\nculminating in 1840 in a very personal attack by Buck's assistant, the 28-year-old William Henry Barlow, and causing Nicholson considerable distress.[22]/nIt is really very lamentable to see a man of the standing Peter Nicholson once had, obliged to have recourse to so mean and unworthy subterfuge; and it is still more lamentable to see him forget himself so much in the language he makes use of. [\u2026] Is he ignorant of the fact that Mr. Buck has surmounted this difficulty by the simple expedient of adjusting the angle of the intrado\u2014or is it that, rather than acknowledge his inferiority, he persists in what he knows to be wrong, and addresses his book to the working classes in the hope of escaping detection? [\u2026] It is perfectly distressing to see a problem which admits of easy solution so miserably mutilated in his hands. [\u2026] Mr. Nicholson's rules however are not only very unnecessarily tedious, but it would appear by his own showing, that they are not over certain in their results. [\u2026] However, I will say no more. For this time I have, as he observes, \"done with him\" and I hope enough has been said to show Mr. Nicholson that his ideas have got a twist in their beds by no means adapted to skew-bridges, and that no species of brow-beating or invective on his part will be of the slightest use to him, while his book [The Guide to Railway Masonry, containing a Complete Treatise on the Oblique Arch, published on 1 January 1839] remains so very imperfect./nA measure of the high esteem in which Nicholson was held by the residents of Newcastle and their sense of injustice at his financial plight can be gauged from the petition sent to the king in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain a pension on his behalf./nThe works of Peter Nicholson, while they have contributed to the advancement of knowledge, have tended to raise the English mechanic to that pre-eminence he has attained over the other artificers of Europe; and while they have been honoured with the proudest marks of distinction by the various learned societies of this kingdom, have yet failed to produce to their author those benefits which are necessary for his existence; and it must ever be a source of regret that an individual who, having devoted his best energies to the advancement of science, should be left at the close of a long and laborious life, and in his seventy-third year, to struggle in penury and want./nNicholson was a prolific writer, contributing practical information on a wide range of technical subjects in 27 works./nNicholson also edited and revised later editions of the following publications by other authors./nHe also contributed several articles to Rees's Cyclop\u00e6dia.", "12428320": "Arthur T.

At one of these conferences he met well-known magician and skeptic James Randi, who greatly influenced Benjamin's decision to perform Mathemagics shows for live audiences. Randi invited him to perform his mathematical tricks on a television program called Exploring Psychic Powers Live, co-hosted by Uri Geller. Randi also encouraged Benjamin to become involved in the growing skeptical movement. He attended early meetings of the Southern California Skeptics in the 1990s, which later evolved into the Skeptics Society. It was at these meetings that he met Skeptics Society President Michael Shermer, who would later become a co-author on three of Benjamin's books.[5]/nBenjamin regularly performs his Mathemagics program for live audiences at schools, colleges, conferences, and even at The Magic Castle in Hollywood, California.[6] These shows feature Benjamin performing mathematical feats like rapidly squaring numbers with up to five digits and correctly identifying the day of the week on which audience members were born based on their birth dates.[7]/nHe was also featured in Mathemagics, a multimedia disc released for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer in 1994, which consists largely of short demonstrations and lessons by Benjamin in mental math and Mathemagics.[8]/nBenjamin has appeared in three TED Talks.

In addition to his contributions to Ulugh Beg's famous work Zij-i-Sultani and to the founding of Sahn-\u0131 Seman Medrese, one of the first centers for the study of various traditional Islamic sciences in the Ottoman Empire, Ali Ku\u015f\u00e7u was also the author of several scientific works and textbooks on astronomy.[2]/nAli Ku\u015f\u00e7u was born in 1403 in the city of Samarkand, in present-day Uzbekistan. His full name at birth was Ala al-D\u012bn Ali ibn Muhammed al-Qushji. The last name Qushji derived from the Turkish term ku\u015f\u00e7u\u2014\"falconer\"[3]\u2014due to the fact that Ali's father Muhammad was the royal falconer of Ulugh Beg.[2] Sources consider him Turkic[4] or Persian.[5]/nHe attended the courses of Qazi zadeh Rumi, Ghiy\u0101th al-D\u012bn Jamsh\u012bd K\u0101sh\u0101n\u012b and Muin al-D\u012bn Kashi. He moved to Kerman, Iran (Persia), where he conducted some research on storms in the Oman sea. He completed Hall-e Eshkal-i Ghammar (Explanations of the Periods of the Moon) and Sharh-e Tajrid in Kirman. He moved to Herat and taught Molla Cami about astronomy (1423). After professing in Herat for a while, he returned to Samarkand. There he presented his work on the Moon to Ulugh Beg, who found it so fascinating that he read the entire work while standing up. Ulugh Beg assigned him to Ulugh Beg Observatory, which was called Samarkand Observatory at that time. Qushji worked there until Ulugh Beg was assassinated.[6]/nAfter Ulugh Beg's death, Ali Ku\u015f\u00e7u went to Herat, Tashkent, and finally Tabriz where, around 1470, the Ak Koyunlu ruler Uzun Hasan sent him as a delegate to the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II. At that time Husayn Bayqarah had come to reign in Herat but Qushji preferred Constantinople over Herat because of Sultan Mehmed's attitude toward scientists and intellectuals./nWhen he came to Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), his grandson Ghutb al-D\u012bn Muhammed had a son Mirim \u00c7elebi who would be a great mathematician and astronomer in the future.[7] Ali Ku\u015f\u00e7u composed \"risalah dar hay\u2019at\" in Persian for Mehmed II at Constantinople in 1470.[8] Also he wrote \"Sharh e resalye Fathiyeh\",[9] \"resalye Mohammadiye\" in Constantinople, which are in Arabic on the topic of mathematics. He then finished \"Sharh e tejrid\" on Nasir al-Din al-Tusi's \"Tejrid al-kalam\". That work is called \"Sharh e Jadid\" in scientific community./nQushji improved on Nasir al-Din al-Tusi's planetary model and presented an alternative planetary model for Mercury.[10] He was also one of the astronomers that were part of Ulugh Beg's team of researchers working at the Samarqand observatory and contributed towards the Zij-i-Sultani compiled there. In addition to his contributions to Zij, Ali Ku\u015f\u00e7u wrote nine works in astronomy, two of them in Persian and seven in Arabic.[2] A Latin translation of two of Qushji's works, the Tract on Arithmetic and Tract on Astronomy, was published by John Greaves in 1650./nQushji's most important astronomical work is Concerning the Supposed Dependence of Astronomy upon Philosophy. Under the influence of Islamic theologians who opposed the interference of Aristotelianism in astronomy, Qushji rejected Aristotelian physics and completely separated natural philosophy from Islamic astronomy, allowing astronomy to become a purely empirical and mathematical science. This allowed him to explore alternatives to the Aristotelian notion of a stationary Earth, as he explored the idea of a moving Earth instead (though Emilie Savage-Smith asserts that no Islamic astronomers proposed a heliocentric universe[11]). He found empirical evidence for the Earth's rotation through his observation on comets and concluded, on the basis of empirical evidence rather than speculative philosophy, that the moving Earth theory is just as likely to be true as the stationary Earth theory.[12][13][14]/nHis predecessor al-Tusi had previously realized that \"the monoformity of falling bodies, and the uniformity of celestial motions,\" both moved \"in a single way\", though he still relied on Aristotelian physics to provide \"certain principles that only the natural philosophers could provide the astronomer.\" Qushji took this concept further and proposed that \"the astronomer had no need for Aristotelian physics and in fact should establish his own physical principles independently of the natural philosophers.\" Alongside his rejection of Aristotle's concept of a stationary Earth,[15] Qushji suggested that there was no need for astronomers to follow the Aristotelian notion of the heavenly bodies moving in uniform circular motion.[11]/nQushji's work was an important step away from Aristotelian physics and towards an independent astronomical physics.[16] This is considered to be a \"conceptual revolution\"[11][16] that had no precedent in European astronomy prior to the Copernican Revolution in the 16th century.[17] Qushji's view on the Earth's motion was similar to the later views of Nicolaus Copernicus on this issue, though it is uncertain whether the former had any influence on the latter. However, it is likely that they both may have arrived at similar conclusions due to using the earlier work of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi as a basis. This is more of a possibility considering \"the remarkable coincidence between a passage in De revolutionibus (I.8) and one in \u1e6c\u016bs\u012b\u2019s Tadhkira (II.1[6]) in which Copernicus follows \u1e6c\u016bs\u012b\u2019s objection to Ptolemy\u2019s \"proofs\" of the Earth's immobility.\"[18]/n[19][20]/n[21]/n[22]/n[23]", "63906865": "Jan Saxl (5 June 1948 \u2013 2 May 2020) was a Czech-British mathematician, and a professor at the University of Cambridge.

She was known as a \"human computer\" for her tremendous mathematical capability and ability to work with space trajectories with such little technology and recognition at the time./nIn 2015, President Barack Obama awarded Johnson the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 2016, she was presented with the Silver Snoopy Award by NASA astronaut Leland D. Melvin and a NASA Group Achievement Award. She was portrayed by Taraji P.

In 2019, Johnson was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal by the United States Congress.[5] In 2021, she was inducted posthumously into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[6]/nKatherine Johnson was born as Creola Katherine Coleman on August 26, 1918, in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, to Joylette Roberta (n\u00e9e Lowe) and Joshua McKinley Coleman.[7][8][9][10] She was the youngest of four children.[11] Her mother was a teacher and her father was a lumberman, farmer, and handyman. He also worked at the Greenbrier Hotel.[8][12]/nJohnson showed strong mathematical abilities from an early age. Because Greenbrier County did not offer public schooling for African-American students past the eighth grade, the Colemans arranged for their children to attend high school in Institute, West Virginia. This school was on the campus of West Virginia State College (WVSC);[13] Johnson was enrolled when she was ten years old.[14] The family split their time between Institute during the school year and White Sulphur Springs in the summer.[15]/nAfter graduating from high school at the age of 14, Johnson matriculated at WVSC, a historically black college.[16] She took every course in mathematics offered by the college. Several professors mentored her, including the chemist and mathematician Angie Turner King, who had guided Coleman throughout high school, and W. W. Schieffelin Claytor, the third African-American to receive a doctorate in mathematics. Claytor added new mathematics courses just for Johnson.[17] She graduated summa cum laude in 1937, with degrees in mathematics and French, at age 18.[18][14][19] Johnson was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha.[20] She took on a teaching job at a black public school in Marion, Virginia.[16][21]/nIn 1939, after marrying her first husband, James Goble, she left her teaching job and enrolled in a graduate math program. She quit at the end of the first session and chose to focus on her family life.[16] She was the first African-American woman to attend graduate school at West Virginia University in Morgantown, West Virginia. Through WVSC's president, Dr. John W. Davis, she became one of three African-American students,[16] and the only woman, selected to integrate the graduate school after the 1938 United States Supreme Court ruling in Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada required States which provided public higher education to white students to provide it to black students as well, either by establishing black colleges and universities or by admitting black students to previously white-only universities.[12][22]/nJohnson decided on a career as a research mathematician, although this was a difficult field for African Americans and women to enter. The first jobs she found were in teaching. At a family gathering in 1952, a relative mentioned that the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) was hiring mathematicians.[16] At the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, based in Hampton, Virginia, near Langley Field, NACA hired African-American mathematicians as well as whites for their Guidance and Navigation Department. Johnson accepted a job offer from the agency in June 1953.[8]/nAccording to an oral history archived by the National Visionary Leadership Project:/nAt first she [Johnson] worked in a pool of women performing math calculations. Katherine has referred to the women in the pool as virtual \"computers who wore skirts\". Their main job was to read the data from the plane's black boxes and carry out other precise mathematical tasks. Then one day, Katherine (and a colleague) were temporarily assigned to help the all-male flight research team. Katherine's knowledge of analytic geometry helped make quick allies of male bosses and colleagues to the extent that, \"they forgot to return me to the pool\". While the racial and gender barriers were always there, Katherine ignored them. Katherine was assertive, asking to be included in editorial meetings (where no women had gone before). She simply told people she had done the work and that she belonged.[8]/nFrom 1953 to 1958, Johnson worked as a computer,[23] analyzing topics such as gust alleviation for aircraft. Originally assigned to the West Area Computers section supervised by mathematician Dorothy Vaughan, Johnson was reassigned to the Guidance and Control Division of Langley's Flight Research Division. It was staffed by white male engineers.[24] In keeping with the State of Virginia's racial segregation laws, and federal workplace segregation introduced under President Woodrow Wilson in the early 20th\u00a0century, Johnson and the other African-American women in the computing pool were required to work, eat, and use restrooms that were separate from those of their white peers. Their office was labeled as \"Colored Computers\". In an interview with WHRO-TV, Johnson stated that she \"didn't feel the segregation at NASA, because everybody there was doing research. You had a mission and you worked on it, and it was important to you to do your job\u00a0... and play bridge at lunch.\" She added: \"I didn't feel any segregation. I knew it was there, but I didn't feel it.\"[25]/nNACA disbanded the colored computing pool in 1958 when the agency was superseded by NASA, which adopted digital computers. Although the installation was desegregated,[24] forms of discrimination were still pervasive. Johnson recalled that era:/nWe needed to be assertive as women in that days\u00a0\u2013 assertive and aggressive\u00a0\u2013 and the degree to which we had to be that way depended on where you were. I had to be. In the early days of NASA women were not allowed to put their names on the reports\u00a0\u2013 no woman in my division had had her name on a report. I was working with Ted Skopinski and he wanted to leave and go to Houston\u00a0... but Henry Pearson, our supervisor\u00a0\u2013 he was not a fan of women\u00a0\u2013 kept pushing him to finish the report we were working on. Finally, Ted told him, \"Katherine should finish the report, she's done most of the work anyway.\" So Ted left Pearson with no choice; I finished the report and my name went on it, and that was the first time a woman in our division had her name on something.[26]/nFrom 1958 until her retirement in 1986, Johnson worked as an aerospace technologist, moving during her career to the Spacecraft Controls Branch. She calculated the trajectory for the May\u00a05, 1961, space flight of Alan Shepard, the first American in space.[1] She also calculated the launch window for his 1961 Mercury mission.[27] She plotted backup navigation charts for astronauts in case of electronic failures.[8] When NASA used electronic computers for the first time to calculate John Glenn's orbit around Earth, officials called on Johnson to verify the computer's numbers; Glenn had asked for her specifically and had refused to fly unless Johnson verified the calculations.[1][28][29] Biography.com states these were \"far more difficult calculations, to account for the gravitational pulls of celestial bodies\".[30]/nAs a computer, she calculated the trajectory for Alan Shepard, the first American in space...John Glenn requested that she personally recheck the calculations...before his flight aboard Friendship 7...on which he became the first American to orbit the Earth./nAuthor Margot Lee Shetterly stated, \"So the astronaut who became a hero, looked to this black woman in the still-segregated South at the time as one of the key parts of making sure his mission would be a success.\" She added that, in a time where computing was \"women's work\" and engineering was left to men, \"it really does have to do with us over the course of time sort of not valuing that work that was done by women, however necessary, as much as we might. And it has taken history to get a perspective on that.\"[31]/nJohnson later worked directly with digital computers. Her ability and reputation for accuracy helped to establish confidence in the new technology.[30] In 1961, her work helped to ensure that Alan Shepard's Freedom 7 Mercury capsule would be found quickly after landing, using the accurate trajectory that had been established.[32]/nShe also helped to calculate the trajectory for the 1969 Apollo\u00a011 flight to the Moon.[1][30] During the Moon landing, Johnson was at a meeting in the Pocono Mountains. She and a few others crowded around a small television screen watching the first steps on the Moon.[1] In 1970, Johnson worked on the Apollo\u00a013 Moon mission. When the mission was aborted, her work on backup procedures and charts helped set a safe path for the crew's return to Earth,[30] creating a one-star observation system that would allow astronauts to determine their location with accuracy. In a 2010 interview, Johnson recalled, \"Everybody was concerned about them getting there.

He founded the leading biomathematical journal Mathematical Biosciences./nBellman was born in 1920 in New York City to non-practising[3] Jewish parents of Polish and Russian descent, Pearl (n\u00e9e Saffian) and John James Bellman,[4] who ran a small grocery store on Bergen Street near Prospect Park, Brooklyn.[5] On his religious views, he was an atheist.[6] He attended Abraham Lincoln High School, Brooklyn in 1937,[4] and studied mathematics at Brooklyn College where he earned a BA in 1941. He later earned an MA from the University of Wisconsin. During World War II, he worked for a Theoretical Physics Division group in Los Alamos. In 1946, he received his Ph.D. at Princeton University under the supervision of Solomon Lefschetz.[7] Beginning in 1949, Bellman worked for many years at RAND corporation, and it was during this time that he developed dynamic programming.[8]/nLater in life, Richard Bellman's interests began to emphasize biology and medicine, which he identified as \"the frontiers of contemporary science\". In 1967, he became founding editor of the journal Mathematical Biosciences, which rapidly became (and remains) one of the most important journals in the field of Mathematical Biology. In 1985, the Bellman Prize in Mathematical Biosciences was created in his honor, being awarded biannually to the journal's best research paper./nBellman was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 1973, which was removed but resulted in complications that left him severely disabled. He was a professor at the University of Southern California, a Fellow in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1975),[9] a member of the National Academy of Engineering (1977),[10] and a member of the National Academy of Sciences (1983)./nHe was awarded the IEEE Medal of Honor in 1979, \"for contributions to decision processes and control system theory, particularly the creation and application of dynamic programming\".[11] His key work is the Bellman equation./nA Bellman equation, also known as a dynamic programming equation, is a necessary condition for optimality associated with the mathematical optimization method known as dynamic programming. Almost any problem which can be solved using optimal control theory can also be solved by analyzing the appropriate Bellman equation. The Bellman equation was first applied to engineering control theory and to other topics in applied mathematics, and subsequently became an important tool in economic theory.[12]/nThe Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman equation (HJB) is a partial differential equation which is central to optimal control theory. The solution of the HJB equation is the 'value function', which gives the optimal cost-to-go for a given dynamical system with an associated cost function. Classical variational problems, for example, the brachistochrone problem can be solved using this method as well. The equation is a result of the theory of dynamic programming which was pioneered in the 1950s by Richard Bellman and coworkers. The corresponding discrete-time equation is usually referred to as the Bellman equation. In continuous time, the result can be seen as an extension of earlier work in classical physics on the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation by William Rowan Hamilton and Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi.[13]/nThe curse of dimensionality is an expression coined by Bellman to describe the problem caused by the exponential increase in volume associated with adding extra dimensions to a (mathematical) space. One implication of the curse of dimensionality is that some methods for numerical solution of the Bellman equation require vastly more computer time when there are more state variables in the value function. For example, 100 evenly spaced sample points suffice to sample a unit interval with no more than 0.01 distance between points; an equivalent sampling of a 10-dimensional unit hypercube with a lattice with a spacing of 0.01 between adjacent points would require 1020 sample points: thus, in some sense, the 10-dimensional hypercube can be said to be a factor of 1018 \"larger\" than the unit interval.

In the 1920s as Minister of War he was a key figure in building the Maginot Line.[1]  In his second term as prime minister he dealt with the outbreak of rebellion in Syria's Jabal Druze in July\n1925 which had excited public and parliamentary anxiety over the general crisis of France's empire.[2]/nPainlev\u00e9 was born in Paris.[3] Brought up within a family of skilled artisans (his father was a draughtsman) Painlev\u00e9 showed early promise across the range of elementary studies and was initially attracted by either an engineering or political career. However, he finally entered the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in 1883 to study mathematics, receiving his doctorate in 1887 following a period of study at G\u00f6ttingen, Germany with Felix Klein and Hermann Amandus Schwarz.

Marguerite died during the birth of their son Jean Painlev\u00e9 in the following year.[3]/nPainlev\u00e9's mathematical work on differential equations led him to encounter their application to the theory of flight and, as ever, his broad interest in engineering topics fostered an enthusiasm for the emerging field of aviation. In 1908, he became Wilbur Wright's first airplane passenger in France and in 1909 created the first university course in aeronautics.[3]/nSome differential equations can be solved using elementary algebraic operations that involve the trigonometric and exponential functions (sometimes called elementary functions). Many interesting special functions arise as solutions of linear second order ordinary differential equations. Around the turn of the century, \nPainlev\u00e9, \u00c9. Picard, and B. Gambier showed that\nof the class of nonlinear second order ordinary differential equations with polynomial coefficients, those that possess a certain desirable technical property, shared by the linear equations (nowadays commonly referred to as the 'Painlev\u00e9 property') can always be transformed into one of fifty canonical forms.  Of these fifty equations, just six require 'new' transcendental functions for their solution.[4] These new transcendental functions, solving the remaining six equations, are called the Painlev\u00e9 transcendents, and interest in them has revived recently due to their appearance in modern geometry, integrable systems[5] and statistical mechanics.[6][7][8]/nIn 1895 he gave a series of lectures at Stockholm University on differential equations, at the end stating the Painlev\u00e9 conjecture about singularities of the n-body problem.[9] In the same year he published work on the Painlev\u00e9 paradox, an apparent contradiction in simple models of friction.[10]/nIn the 1920s, Painlev\u00e9 briefly turned his attention to the new theory of gravitation, general relativity, which had recently been introduced by Albert Einstein.  In 1921, Painlev\u00e9 proposed the Gullstrand\u2013Painlev\u00e9 coordinates for the Schwarzschild metric.  The modification in the coordinate system was the first to reveal clearly that the Schwarzschild radius is a mere coordinate singularity (with however, profound global significance: it represents the event horizon of a black hole). This essential point was not generally appreciated by physicists until around 1963.[citation needed] In his diary, Harry Graf Kessler recorded that during a later visit to Berlin, Painlev\u00e9 discussed pacifist international politics with Einstein, but there is no reference to discussions concerning the significance of the Schwarzschild radius.[11]/nBetween 1915 and 1917, Painlev\u00e9 served as French Minister for Public Instruction and Inventions. In December 1915, he requested a scientific exchange agreement between France and Britain, resulting in Anglo-French collaboration that ultimately led to the parallel development by Paul Langevin in France and Robert Boyle in Britain of the first active sonar.[12]/nPainlev\u00e9 took his aviation interests, along with those in naval and military matters, with him when he became, in 1906, Deputy for Paris's 5th arrondissement, the so-called Latin Quarter. By 1910, he had vacated his academic posts and World War I led to his active participation in military committees, joining Aristide Briand's cabinet in 1915 as Minister for Public Instruction and Inventions.[3]/nOn his appointment as War Minister in March 1917 he was immediately called upon to give his approval, albeit with some misgivings, to Robert Georges Nivelle's wildly optimistic plans for a breakthrough offensive in Champagne. Painlev\u00e9 reacted to the disastrous public failure of the plan by dismissing Nivelle and controversially replacing him with Henri Philippe P\u00e9tain.[13] He was also responsible for isolating the Russian Expeditionary Force in France in the La Courtine camp, located in a remote spot on the plateau of Millevaches.[14]/nOn 7 September 1917, Prime Minister Alexandre Ribot lost the support of the Socialists and Painlev\u00e9 was called upon to form a new government.[3]/nPainlev\u00e9 was a leading voice at the Rapallo conference that led to the establishment of the Supreme Allied Council, a consultative body of Allied powers that anticipated the unified Allied command finally established in the following year. He appointed Ferdinand Foch as French representative knowing that he was the natural Allied commander. On Painlev\u00e9's return to Paris he was defeated and resigned on 13 November 1917 to be succeeded by Georges Clemenceau. Foch was finally named Allied generalissimo in March 1918, eventually becoming commander-in-chief of all Allied armies on the Western and Italian fronts.[3][13][15]/nPainlev\u00e9 then played little active role in politics until the election of November 1919 when he emerged as a leftist critic of the right-wing Bloc National. By the time the next election approached in May 1924 his collaboration with \u00c9douard Herriot, a fellow member of Briand's 1915 cabinet, had led to the formation of the Cartel des Gauches. Winning the election, Herriot became Prime Minister in June, while Painlev\u00e9 became President of the Chamber of Deputies. Though Painlev\u00e9 ran for President of France in 1924 he was defeated by Gaston Doumergue. Herriot's administration publicly recognised the Soviet Union, accepted the Dawes Plan and agreed to evacuate the Ruhr. However, a financial crisis arose from the ensuing devaluation of the franc and in April 1925, Herriot fell and Painlev\u00e9 became Prime Minister for a second time on 17 April. Unfortunately, he was unable to offer convincing remedies for the financial problems and was forced to resign on 21 November.[3][13][16]/nFollowing Painlev\u00e9's resignation, Briand formed a new government with Painlev\u00e9 as Minister for War. Though Briand was defeated by Raymond Poincar\u00e9 in 1926, Painlev\u00e9 continued in office. Poincar\u00e9 stabilised the franc with a return to the gold standard, but ultimately acceded power to Briand.[3] During his tenure as Minister of War, Painlev\u00e9 was instrumental in the creation of the Maginot Line. This line of military fortifications along France's Eastern border was largely designed by Painlev\u00e9, yet named for Andr\u00e9 Maginot, owing to Maginot's championing of public support and funding.[citation needed] Painlev\u00e9 remained in office as Minister for War until July 1929.[3]/nFrom 1925 to 1933, Painlev\u00e9 represented France in the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations (he replaced Henri Bergson and was himself replaced by \u00c9douard Herriot).[17]/nThough he was proposed for President of France in 1932, Painlev\u00e9 withdrew before the election. He became Minister of Air later that year, making proposals for an international treaty to ban the manufacture of bomber aircraft and to establish an international air force to enforce global peace. On the fall of the government in January 1933, his political career ended.[3]/nPainlev\u00e9 died in Paris in October of the same year.[13] On 4 November, after a eulogy by Prime Minister Albert Sarraut, he was interred in the Panth\u00e9on.[18]/nChanges/nChanges", "62956618": "Astrid Beckmann (n\u00e9e Rautenberg, born 20 December 1957) is a German physicist, a professor of mathematics and mathematics education, and was a long-serving university president.[1] Beckmann served as president of the P\u00e4dagogische Hochschule Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd from 2010 to 2018.[1] She also taught at the University of Ulm./nBeckmann was born in Berlin.

Barcan,[5] was, as Don Garrett notes[2] \"one of the twentieth century's most important and influential philosopher-logicians\". Timothy Williamson, in a 2008 celebration of Marcus' long career, states that many of her \"main ideas are not just original, and clever, and beautiful, and fascinating, and influential, and way ahead of their time, but actually \u2013 I believe \u2013 true\".[6]/nRuth Barcan (as she was known before marrying the physicist Jules Alexander Marcus in 1942[7]) graduated magna cum laude from New York University in 1941, majoring in mathematics and philosophy. She then went to graduate school at Yale, obtaining her M.A. in 1942 and her PhD in 1946.[7]/nMarcus was a visiting professor at Northwestern University from 1950 until 1953 and, again, in 1959. She served as assistant, and then as associate, professor at the newly founded Roosevelt University, Chicago, between 1956 and 1963.  From 1964 to 1970, she was a professor of philosophy at the University of Illinois Chicago (originally serving as a head of department). She was professor of philosophy at Northwestern University from 1970 until 1973, when she was appointed as the Reuben Post Halleck Professor of Philosophy at Yale University until retiring, as a professor emerita, in 1992. She continued to teach, during winter semesters, at the University of California, Irvine until 1997.[4][8]/nAmongst other professional offices held during her career, Marcus served as chair of the board of officers for the American Philosophical Association (1976\u201383) and as president of both the Association for Symbolic Logic (1983\u201386) and then of the Institut International de Philosophie\u00a0[de] (1989\u201392).[4][7]/nThe widely discussed Barcan formula is introduced as an axiom in QML.[9]:\u200a481\u200a In her earliest published work, the publication of the first axiomatic study of modal logic with quantifiers, Marcus published under her maiden name Ruth C. Barcan. It features these three articles: \"A Functional Calculus of First Order Based on Strict Implication\", Journal of Symbolic Logic (JSL, 1946), \"The Deduction Theorem in a Functional Calculus of First Order Based on Strict Implication\" (JSL, 1946), and \"The Identity of Individuals in a Strict Functional Calculus of Second Order\", (JSL, 1947)./nThe first systems of quantified modal logic, which extended some propositional modal systems of Clarence Irving Lewis to first and second order; the papers of 1946 and 1947, were a major accomplishment in the development of 20th century logic./nLewis gives Marcus special recognition in his \"Notes on the Logic of Intension\", originally printed in Structure, Method, and Meaning: Essays in Honor of Henry M. Sheffer (New York, 1951). Here Lewis recognizes Barcan Marcus as the first logician to extend propositional logic as a higher order intensional logic./nMarcus proposed the view in the philosophy of language according to which proper names are what Marcus termed mere \"tags\" (\"Modalities and Intensional Languages\" (Synthese, 1961) and elsewhere). According to her tag theory of names (a direct reference theory), these \"tags\" are used to refer to an object, which is the bearer of the name. The meaning of the name is regarded as exhausted by this referential function. This view contrasts for example with Bertrand Russell's description theory of proper names as well as John Searle's cluster description theory of names[10] which prevailed at the time. This view of proper names (presented in 1962 with Willard Van Orman Quine as commentator) has been identified by Quentin Smith with the theory of reference given in Saul Kripke's Naming and Necessity.[11] However, in a recent laudatio to Ruth Barcan Marcus, Professor Timothy Williamson says:/nOne of the ideas in them that resonates most with current philosophy of language is that of proper names as mere tags, without descriptive content. This is not Kripke's idea of names as rigid designators, designating the same object with respect to all relevant worlds, for 'rigidified' definite descriptions are rigid designators but still have descriptive content. Rather, it is the idea, later developed by David Kaplan and others, that proper names are directly referential, in the sense that they contribute only their bearer to the propositions expressed by sentences in which they occur.[12]/nThe philosopher of language Stephen Neale has also argued against Professor Smith's claim in the Times Literary Supplement.[13]/nMarcus formally proved the necessity of identity in 1946 and informally argued for it in 1961, thereafter thus rejecting the possibility of contingent identity. See Journal of Symbolic Logic, (1947) 12: pp 12\u201315/nMarcus prefers an interpretation where the domain of the interpretation comprises individual entities in the actual world. She also suggests that for some uses an alternative substitutional semantics is warranted. She provides arguments against possibilia. See  \"Dispensing with Possibilia\" (Proceedings of the American Philosophical Association, 1975\u201376); \"Possibilia and Possible Worlds\" (Grazer Philosophische Studien, 1985\u201386)./nMarcus defines a consistent set of moral principles as one in which there is some \"possible world \" in which they are all obeyable. That they may conflict in the actual world is not a mark of inconsistency. As in the case of necessity of identity, there was a resistance to this interpretation of moral conflict. Her argument counts against a widely received view that systems of moral rules are inevitably inconsistent.[14]/nIt is proposed that believing is a relationship of an agent to a possible state of affairs under specified internal and external circumstances. Assenting to a quoted sentence (the disquotation account of belief) is only one behavioral marker of believing. Betting behavior is another. The wholly language-centered account of belief (e.g. Davidson) is rejected. Where an agent would traditionally be described as believing an impossibility until its impossibility was disclosed, Marcus proposes that under those circumstances the agent should say that she only claimed to believe an impossibility. In much the same way, when a mathematician discovers that one of his conjectures is false, and since if it is mathematically false it is impossible, he would say he only claimed that the conjecture was true. Odd as this proposal is, it is analogous to the widely accepted principle about knowing: if we claim to know P, and P turns out false, we do not say we used to know it, we say we were mistaken in so claiming.[15]/nAristotelian essentialism is concerned with properties which Marcus defines in the context of a modal framework. One proposal is that a property is essential if something has it, not everything has it, if something has it then it has it necessarily, and it is not wholly individuating e.g. a natural kind property. It is otherwise claimed by Quine and others that modal logic or semantics is committed to essentialist truths. Marcus argues informally that there are interpretations of some modal systems in which all essentialist claims are false. Terence Parsons later formally proved this result.[16]/nAn alternative to Tarskian (model theoretic) semantics is proposed for some uses where \"the truth conditions for quantified formuli are given purely in terms of truth with no appeal to domains of interpretation\". This has come to be called \"truth-value semantics\".  Marcus shows that the claim that such a semantics leads to contradictions is false.[17] Such a semantics may be of interest for mathematics, e.g. Hartry Field, or for fictional discourse. Objectual quantification is required for interpretation of identity and other metaphysical categories./nBooks (written or edited)/nAcademic Papers", "63710289": "Timothy P.

He has also worked on Ring Theory, Lie Algebras, and other areas. Shalev has published around 120 mathematical articles in various international journals./nThe first fruits of Shalev's research solve various problems in Group Rings using a unified method based on dimension subgroups. Subsequently, he worked extensively in p-groups and pro-p groups and was among those who solved the coclass conjectures on the structure of such groups. Likewise Shalev used Lie methods to solve problems on fixed points of automorphisms of p-groups, and studied subgroup growth of profinite and discrete groups./nFrom 1995 Shalev developed and applied probabilistic methods to finite groups and (nonabelian) finite simple groups in particular. A formative result in this area shows that almost every pair of elements in a finite simple group generate the group. This result, like many others in the field, were proved by Shalev in collaboration with Martin Liebeck of Imperial College at the University of London. The probabilistic approach led to the solution of many classical problems whose formulation does not involve probability; these problems concern quotients of the modular group, conjectures of Babai and of Cameron on permutation groups, diameters of certain Cayley graphs, Fuchsian groups, random walks, etc./nShalev (partly with Larsen) has been researching the behavior of word maps on groups, proving Waring type theorems; he also proved, together with Liebeck, O\u2019Brien and Tiep, the Ore conjecture from 1951, according to which every element in a non-cyclic finite simple group is a commutator./nShalev's approach to writing emphasizes language and structure.

The manuscript of this book was awarded the Harry Harishon Prize under the auspices of the Hebrew University, in 1986. This is a collection of four stories with a musical superstructure in which Shalev attempts to apply musical terms and concepts to language and to emotions. The book is composed of two major parts: the first part, \"Legato\", is characterized by a flowing mode, long sentences without much punctuation and psychologically conveys a state of openness, whereas the second part, \"Staccato\", is characterized by short sentences, copious punctuation and an  introspective, closed mood./nThe first of the four stories, \u2018Opus 1\u2019, describes a boy who falls in love with his piano teacher. The second story, \u2018Concussion\u2019, portrays a relationship between two young people, and opens with an injury, providing the characters with a new perspective. The third story, \u2018Scherzo\u2019, deals with the journey to New York of an eccentric harpsichord player. The fourth story, \u2018Absence\u2019, describes the release from the army on psychiatric grounds of an AWOL interested in being the object of a search party. This story is formally structured as a crossword puzzle with two coordinates and has been described as \u2018a crossword riddled with contradictions demanding solutions\u2019./nShalev's second book was published in 1996 in the \u2018New Library\u2019 series (Siman Kri'a \u2013 ha-Kibbutz ha-Me'uhad) edited by Menachem Peri. The book is composed of seventy openings of stories. The book bears a major element of fragmentation and gaps, and treats openings, or overtures, in the widest sense of the term; at times the stories have an opening and no ending; at others there is only a middle part and the beginning and ending are missing. On the one hand Shalev creates an intense mode of writing, featuring a video-clip nature, and on the other hand he seduces the readers toward filling in the gaps by themselves. Large parts of the book describe many places in the world where people arrive for short, breathless periods and are constantly on the go./nShalev's third book is a novel that was published in 2004 at the Zmora Bitan publishing house.[2] It has appeared in German (2007), Italian (2007) and Czech (2009). The book describes a love triangle between a man and two women. Shalev was influenced in this book by the modern astrophysical theory of Dark Matter and Dark Energy; he applies these ideas to relationships between women and men. Alongside physical attraction between men and women, Shalev describes forces of repulsion, which overwhelmingly overcome the forces of attraction. This is an attempt to understand why many love stories which begin so well end so badly. The protagonist of the book is a married Israeli diplomat in New York who, during a visit to Israel, falls in love with a woman doing a doctorate in Physics on Dark Matter. The text is formally divided between emails sent by the woman to the man in the period before their tryst in New York, and descriptions from the man's perspective of that tryst. As the plot progresses the emails asymptotically approach in time the meeting in New York and illuminate its background, but these two types of text and narrative never coalesce.", "73507943": "Ana Mar\u00eda Carpio Rodr\u00edguez is a Spanish applied mathematician whose research has included inverse problems, the propagation of dislocations in crystals, fluid dynamics, reaction\u2013diffusion systems, and cancer metastasis.[1] She is a professor of applied mathematics at the Complutense University of Madrid.[2]/nCarpio studied mathematics and numerical analysis at the University of the Basque Country, earning bachelor's and master's degrees in 1988.

According to Ptolemy, during Aristarchus' time there, he observed the summer solstice of 280 BCE.[2] Along with his contributions to the heliocentric model, as reported by Vitruvius, he created two separate sundials: one that is a flat disc; and one hemispherical.[3]/nAristarchus was influenced by the concept presented by Philolaus of Croton (c. 470 \u2013 385 BCE) of a fire at the center of the universe, but Aristarchus identified the \"central fire\" with the Sun and he put the other planets in their correct order of distance around the Sun.[4]/nLike Anaxagoras before him, Aristarchus suspected that the stars were just other bodies like the Sun, albeit farther away from Earth. His astronomical ideas were often rejected in favor of the geocentric theories of Aristotle and Ptolemy. Nicolaus Copernicus knew about the possibility that Aristarchus had a 'moving Earth' theory, although it is unlikely that Copernicus was aware that it was a heliocentric theory.[6][7]/nAristarchus estimated the sizes of the Sun and Moon as compared to Earth's size. He also estimated the distances from the Earth to the Sun and Moon. He is considered one of the greatest astronomers of antiquity along with Hipparchus./nThe original text has been lost, but a reference in a book by Archimedes, entitled The Sand Reckoner (Archimedis Syracusani Arenarius & Dimensio Circuli), describes a work in which Aristarchus advanced the heliocentric model as an alternative hypothesis to geocentrism:/nYou are now aware ['you' being King Gelon] that the \"universe\" is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere the centre of which is the centre of the earth, while its radius is equal to the straight line between the centre of the sun and the centre of the earth. This is the common account (\u03c4\u1f70 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1) as you have heard from astronomers. But Aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses, wherein it appears, as a consequence of the assumptions made, that the universe is many times greater than the \"universe\" just mentioned. His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the sun remain unmoved, that the earth revolves about the sun on the circumference of a circle, the sun lying in the middle of the orbit, and that the sphere of the fixed stars, situated about the same centre as the sun, is so great that the circle in which he supposes the earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the centre of the sphere bears to its surface.[8]/nAristarchus suspected the stars were other suns that are very far away,[9] and that in consequence there was no observable parallax, that is, a movement of the stars relative to each other as the Earth moves around the Sun. Since stellar parallax is only detectable with telescopes, his accurate speculation was unprovable at the time./nIt is a common misconception that the heliocentric view was held as sacrilegious by the contemporaries of Aristarchus.[10] Lucio Russo traces this to Gilles M\u00e9nage's printing of a passage from Plutarch's On the Apparent Face in the Orb of the Moon, in which Aristarchus jokes with Cleanthes, who is head of the Stoics, a sun worshipper, and opposed to heliocentrism.[10] In the manuscript of Plutarch's text, Aristarchus says Cleanthes should be charged with impiety.[10] M\u00e9nage's version, published shortly after the trials of Galileo and Giordano Bruno, transposes an accusative and nominative so that it is Aristarchus who is purported to be impious.[10] The resulting misconception of an isolated and persecuted Aristarchus is still transmitted today.[10][11]/nAccording to Plutarch, while Aristarchus postulated heliocentrism only as a hypothesis, Seleucus of Seleucia, a Hellenistic astronomer who lived a century after Aristarchus, maintained it as a definite opinion and gave a demonstration of it,[12] but no full record of the demonstration has been found. In his Naturalis Historia, Pliny the Elder later wondered whether errors in the predictions about the heavens could be attributed to a displacement of the Earth from its central position.[13]  Pliny[14] and Seneca[15] referred to the retrograde motion of some planets as an apparent (and not real) phenomenon, which is an implication of heliocentrism rather than geocentrism. Still, no stellar parallax was observed, and Plato, Aristotle, and Ptolemy preferred the geocentric model that was held as true throughout the Middle Ages./nThe heliocentric theory was revived by Copernicus,[16] after which Johannes Kepler described planetary motions with greater accuracy with his three laws. Isaac Newton later gave a theoretical explanation based on laws of gravitational attraction and dynamics./nAfter realizing that the Sun was much larger than the Earth and the other planets, Aristarchus concluded that planets revolved around the Sun./nThe only known surviving work usually attributed to Aristarchus, On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon, is based on a geocentric worldview. Historically, it has been read as stating that the angle subtended by the Sun's diameter is two degrees, but Archimedes states in The Sand Reckoner that Aristarchus had a value of half a degree, which is much closer to the average value of 32' or 0.53 degrees. The discrepancy may come from a misinterpretation of what unit of measure was meant by a certain Greek term in the text of Aristarchus.[17]/nAristarchus claimed that at half moon (first or last quarter moon), the angle between the Sun and Moon was 87\u00b0.[18] He might have proposed 87\u00b0 as a lower bound, since gauging the lunar terminator's deviation from linearity to one degree of accuracy is beyond the unaided human ocular limit (with that limit being about three arcminutes of accuracy). Aristarchus is known to have studied light and vision as well.[19]/nUsing correct geometry, but the insufficiently accurate 87\u00b0 datum, Aristarchus concluded that the Sun was between 18 and 20 times farther away from the Earth than the Moon.[20] (The true value of this angle is close to 89\u00b0\u00a050', and the Sun's distance is approximately 400 times that of the Moon.) The implicit false solar parallax of slightly under three degrees was used by astronomers up to and including Tycho Brahe, c.\u00a0AD\u00a01600. Aristarchus pointed out that the Moon and Sun have nearly equal apparent angular sizes, and therefore their diameters must be in proportion to their distances from Earth.[21]/nIn On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon, Aristarchus discusses the size of the Moon and Sun in relation to the Earth. In order to achieve these measurements and subsequent calculations, he used several key notes made while observing a lunar eclipse.[22] The first of these consisted of the time that it took for the Earth's shadow to fully encompass the Moon, along with how long the Moon remained within the shadow. This was used to estimate the angular radius of the shadow.[23] From there, using the width of the cone that was created by the shadow in relation to the Moon, he determined that it was twice the diameter of the Moon at the full, non-central eclipse. In addition to this, Aristarchus estimated that the length of the shadow extended around 2.4 times the distance of the Moon from the Earth.[22]/nUsing these calculations, along with the aforementioned estimated distances of the Sun from the Earth and Moon from the Earth, he created a triangle. Employing a similar method of geometry that he previously used for the distances, he was able to determine that the diameter of the Moon is roughly one-third that of the Earth's diameter. In order to estimate the size of the Sun, Aristarchus considered the proportion of the Sun's distance to Earth in comparison to the Moon's distance from Earth, which was found to be roughly 18 to 20 times the length. Therefore, the size of the Sun is around 19 times wider than the Moon, making it approximately six times wider than the Earth's diameter.[22]/nThe lunar crater Aristarchus, the minor planet 3999 Aristarchus, and the telescope Aristarchos are named after him.", "26518637": "Richard K.

He then got a position as an assistant, later promoted to senior assistant, at the town's Ernst Moritz Arndt University (EMAU).[1]   He received his doctorate in 1962 for a dissertation on the Descriptive Theory of Integration,[2] and achieved further academic promotion (Habilitation) in 1967 for work on the Theory of Maximalen Integrals.

In the course of his life he wrote approximately fifty research and expository papers in geometry. He is also the author of various core books on mathematics and geometry some of which have remained in print for decades and been translated into several languages. These books include the three-volume Methods of Algebraic Geometry (which he wrote in collaboration with W. V. D. Hodge), The Gentle Art of Mathematics, Circles: A Mathematical View, Geometry and the Visual Arts and most recently Japanese Temple Geometry Problems: San Gaku (with Hidetoshi Fukagawa)./nDaniel Pedoe was born in London in 1910, the youngest of thirteen children of Szmul Abramski, a Jewish immigrant from Poland who found himself in London in the 1890s: he had boarded a cattleboat not knowing whether it was bound for New York or London, so his final destination was one of blind chance. Pedoe's mother, Ryfka Raszka Pedowicz, was the only child of Wolf Pedowicz, a corn merchant and his wife, Sarah Haimnovna Pecheska from \u0141om\u017ca then in Congress Poland (that part of Poland then under Russian control). The family name requires some explanation. The father, Abramski, was one of the Kohanim, a priestly group, and once in Britain, he changed his surname to Cohen. At first, all thirteen children took the surname Cohen, but later, to avoid any potential antisemitism, some of the Cohen children changed their surname to Pedoe, a contraction of their mother's maiden name; this happened while Daniel was at school, aged 12.[1]/n\"Danny\" was the youngest child in a family of thirteen children and his childhood was spent in relative poverty in the East End of London, despite their father being a skilled cabinetmaker. He attended the Central Foundation Boys' School[2] where he was first influenced in his love of geometry by the headmaster Norman M. Gibbins and a textbook by Godfrey and Siddons. While still at school, Pedoe published his first paper, The geometric interpretation of Cagnoli's equation: sin b sin c + cos b cos c cos A = sin B sin C \u2013 cos B cos C cos a; it appeared in the Mathematical Gazette in 1929.[1] He was successful at the \"ten plus\" examination and subsequently won a Scholarship to study mathematics at Cambridge University./nDuring his first three years at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he was a scholar, Pedoe was tutored in mathematics by Arthur Stanley Ramsey, the father of Frank P. Ramsey. He attended lectures by Ludwig Wittgenstein and Bertrand Russell, although he was unimpressed by the teaching style of either great man. Geometry became his main interest and, advised by Henry Baker, he started work on his doctorate and published several papers. In 1935 he took a break from Cambridge and went to the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton where he worked with Solomon Lefschetz.[1]/nOn his return to England in 1936, Pedoe was appointed as an assistant lecturer of the mathematics department at the University College, Southampton. More of his papers were published and after(?) 1937, he was awarded his PhD on the strength of his thesis, The Exceptional Curves on an Algebraic Surface, which was based on Henry Baker's work on the Italian theory of algebraic surfaces; he was examined by W. V. D. Hodge and Baker at Cambridge.[1]/nIn the late 1930s, Pedoe married Mary Tunstall, an English geographer and the couple had a daughter, Naomi, and identical twin sons, Dan and Hugh, born in December 1939.[1]/nBy 1941, Winchester College had lost several teachers to the army and had become unable to meet its teaching commitments. They requested help and Pedoe was asked to assist with the teaching of mathematics. He taught junior and senior classes (the juniors could be unruly) and in the senior class one of the students was  Freeman Dyson who showed enormous early talent and was strongly encouraged by Pedoe with extra work and reading.[1] Their friendship lasted more than fifty more years until Pedoe's death in 1998 and Dyson's list of people who have most influenced him begins \"Hardy, Pedoe...\"./nIn 1941 a collaboration with W. V. D. Hodge started which lasted some twelve years and included the writing of the huge three-volume work, Methods of Algebraic Geometry. Although the book was originally designed as a geometric counterpart of G. H. Hardy's A Course of Pure Mathematics it was never intended as a textbook and contains original material. First published in the 1940s, all three volumes were reprinted by Cambridge University Press in 1995./nPedoe published three more papers in 1942: A remark on a property of a special pencil of quadrics, On some geometrical inequalities and An inequality for two triangles.[1]/nIn 1942, Pedoe moved to Birmingham for a lectureship at the University of Birmingham, working mainly in engineering mathematics. The family were not happy there, the local air pollution affected his children and Pedoe did not like the working environment. The professor of mathematical physics at Birmingham was Rudolf Peierls, who was working on the British project to develop the atomic bomb; he suggested to Pedoe that he, Pedoe, should do some war-work. He did so, and worked part-time to improve piston rings so as to emulate German dive-bombing tactics.[1]/nIn 1947 he moved to Westfield College, part of the University of London, as a reader in mathematics. Once again, he was unhappy, both from domestic and professional points of view: his salary was insufficient for him to afford to buy a family home and he found the working environment to be \"a strain\".[1]/nEncouraged by Mary to look abroad, he was appointed as head of the mathematics department at the University of Khartoum in the Sudan and took up the role in 1952 on trial basis with leave of absence from Westfield College. When Westfield pressed for firm decision, he resigned and stayed at Khartoum for seven years: the length of his contract.[1] It was during this period that he wrote many of his books including The Gentle Art of Mathematics, Circles and a textbook, An Introduction to projective geometry./nPedoe found the time at Khartoum to his taste; there was a comfortable life-style that allowed him to write and the family joined him each Christmas. Eventually, Mary stayed with him permanently, the children remaining in England.[1]/nIn 1959, he was appointed as head of the mathematics department at the University of Singapore by Sir Alexander Oppenheim.[1]/nUnwilling to retire at 55, the statutory retirement age in Singapore, he moved again, to Indiana in 1962, to take up a position at Purdue University, near Lafayette. Although the location was somewhat isolated, there was an active social life and he was kept busy. One of the positions he held there was as Senior Mathematician to the Minnesota College Geometry Project, which was to improve geometry teaching in high schools and colleges by making films and writing accompanying books.[1]/nAfter two years at Purdue, he was appointed as a professor at the University of Minnesota where he stayed until he retired in 1980, when he was made professor emeritus. He won a Lester R. Ford Award in 1968.[3]/nPedoe's interest and work continued after his retirement and in 1984 he was approached by Hidetoshi Fukagawa, a high-school teacher in Aichi, Japan. Fukagawa had tried unsuccessfully to interest Japanese academics in San Gaku \u2013 Japanese wooden tablets containing geometric theorems which had hung in temples and shrines for around two centuries as offerings to the gods./nA collaboration started which resulted in the publication of the book, Japanese Temple Geometry Problems by the Charles Babbage Research Centre in Canada. The book succeeded in arousing interest in this uniquely Japanese form of mathematics./nDan Pedoe died in 1998, aged 88, after a long period with failing health.

His system, now referred to as Euclidean geometry, involved new innovations in combination with a synthesis of theories from earlier Greek mathematicians, including Eudoxus of Cnidus, Hippocrates of Chios, and Theaetetus. With Archimedes and Apollonius of Perga, Euclid is generally considered among the greatest mathematicians of antiquity, and one of the most influential in the history of mathematics./nVery little is known of Euclid's life, and most information comes from the scholars Proclus and Pappus of Alexandria many centuries later. Medieval Islamic mathematicians invented a fanciful biography, and medieval Byzantine and early Renaissance scholars mistook him for the earlier philosopher Euclid of Megara. It is now generally accepted that he spent his career in Alexandria and lived around 300 BC, after Plato's students and before Archimedes. There is some speculation that Euclid studied at the Platonic Academy and later taught at the Musaeum; he is regarded as bridging the earlier Platonic tradition in Athens with the later tradition of Alexandria./nIn the Elements, Euclid deduced the theorems from a small set of axioms. He also wrote works on perspective, conic sections, spherical geometry, number theory, and mathematical rigour. In addition to the Elements, Euclid wrote a central early text in the optics field, Optics, and lesser-known works including Data and Phaenomena. Euclid's authorship of two other texts\u2014On Divisions of Figures, Catoptrics\u2014has been questioned. He is thought to have written many now lost works./nThe English name 'Euclid' is the anglicized version of the Ancient Greek name Eukle\u00eddes (\u0395\u1f50\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2).[4][a] It is derived from 'eu-' (\u03b5\u1f56; 'well') and 'kl\u00eas' (-\u03ba\u03bb\u1fc6\u03c2; 'fame'), meaning \"renowned, glorious\".[6] In English, by metonymy, 'Euclid' can mean his most well-known work, Euclid's Elements, or a copy thereof,[5] and is sometimes synonymous with 'geometry'.[2]/nLike many ancient Greek mathematicians, the details of Euclid's life are mostly unknown.[7] He is accepted as the author of four mostly extant treatises\u2014the Elements, Optics, Data, Phaenomena\u2014but besides this, there is nothing known for certain of him.[8][b] The traditional narrative mainly follows the 5th century AD account by Proclus in his Commentary on the First Book of Euclid's Elements, as well as a few anecdotes from Pappus of Alexandria in the early 4th century.[4][c]/nAccording to Proclus, Euclid lived shortly after several of Plato's (d.\u2009347 BC) followers and before the mathematician Archimedes (c.\u2009287\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009212 BC);[d] specifically, Proclus placed Euclid during the rule of Ptolemy I (r.\u2009305/304\u2013282 BC).[8][7][e] Euclid's birthdate is unknown; some scholars estimate around 330[11][12] or 325 BC,[2][13] but others refrain from speculating.[14] It is presumed that he was of Greek descent,[11] but his birthplace is unknown.[15][f]/nProclus held that Euclid followed the Platonic tradition, but there is no definitive confirmation for this.[17] It is unlikely he was contemporary with Plato, so it is often presumed that he was educated by Plato's disciples at the Platonic Academy in Athens.[18] Historian Thomas Heath supported this theory, noting that most capable geometers lived in Athens, including many of those whose work Euclid built on;[19] Sialaros considers this a mere conjecture.[20][4] In any event, the contents of Euclid's work demonstrate familiarity with the Platonic geometry tradition.[11]/nIn his Collection, Pappus mentions that Apollonius studied with Euclid's students in Alexandria, and this has been taken to imply that Euclid worked and founded a mathematical tradition there.[8][21][19] The city was founded by Alexander the Great in 331 BC,[22] and the rule of Ptolemy I from 306 BC onwards gave it a stability which was relatively unique amid the chaotic wars over dividing Alexander's empire.[23] Ptolemy began a process of hellenization and commissioned numerous constructions, building the massive Musaeum institution, which was a leading center of education.[15][g] Euclid is speculated to have been among the Musaeum's first scholars.[22]/nEuclid's date of death is unknown; it has been speculated that he died c.\u2009270 BC.[22]/nEuclid is often referred to as 'Euclid of Alexandria' to differentiate him from the earlier philosopher Euclid of Megara, a pupil of Socrates included in dialogues of Plato with whom he was historically conflated.[4][14] Valerius Maximus, the 1st century AD Roman compiler of anecdotes, mistakenly substituted Euclid's name for Eudoxus (4th century BC) as the mathematician to whom Plato sent those asking how to double the cube.[26] Perhaps on the basis of this mention of a mathematical Euclid roughly a century early, Euclid became mixed up with Euclid of Megara in medieval Byzantine sources (now lost),[27] eventually leading Euclid the mathematician to be ascribed details of both men's biographies and described as Megarensis (lit.\u2009'of Megara').[4][28] The Byzantine scholar Theodore Metochites (c.\u20091300) explicitly conflated the two Euclids, as did printer Erhard Ratdolt's 1482 editio princeps of Campanus of Novara's Latin translation of the Elements.[27] After the mathematician Bartolomeo Zamberti\u00a0[fr; de] appended most of the extant biographical fragments about either Euclid to the preface of his 1505 translation of the Elements, subsequent publications passed on this identification.[27] Later Renaissance scholars, particularly Peter Ramus, reevaluated this claim, proving it false via issues in chronology and contradiction in early sources.[27]/nMedieval Arabic sources give vast amounts of information concerning Euclid's life, but are completely unverifiable.[4] Most scholars consider them of dubious authenticity;[8] Heath in particular contends that the fictionalization was done to strengthen the connection between a revered mathematician and the Arab world.[17] There are also numerous anecdotal stories concerning to Euclid, all of uncertain historicity, which \"picture him as a kindly and gentle old man\".[29] The best known of these is Proclus' story about Ptolemy asking Euclid if there was a quicker path to learning geometry than reading his Elements, which Euclid replied with \"there is no royal road to geometry\".[29] This anecdote is questionable since a very similar interaction between Menaechmus and Alexander the Great is recorded from Stobaeus.[30] Both the accounts were written in the 5th century AD, neither indicate their source, and neither story appears in ancient Greek literature.[31]/nAny firm dating of Euclid's activity c.\u2009300 BC is called into question by a lack of contemporary references.[4] The earliest original reference to Euclid is in Apollonius' prefatory letter to the Conics (early 2nd century BC): \"The third book of the Conics contains many astonishing theorems that are useful for both the syntheses and the determinations of number of solutions of solid loci. Most of these, and the finest of them, are novel. And when we discovered them we realized that Euclid had not made the synthesis of the locus on three and four lines but only an accidental fragment of it, and even that was not felicitously done.\"[26] The Elements is speculated to have been at least partly in circulation by the 3rd century BC, as Archimedes and Apollonius take several of its propositions for granted;[4] however, Archimedes employs an older variant of the theory of proportions than the one found in the Elements.[8] The oldest physical copies of material included in the Elements, dating from roughly 100 AD, can be found on papyrus fragments unearthed in an ancient rubbish heap from Oxyrhynchus, Roman Egypt. The oldest extant direct citations to the Elements in works whose dates are firmly known are not until the 2nd century AD, by Galen and Alexander of Aphrodisias; by this time it was a standard school text.[26] Some ancient Greek mathematicians mention Euclid by name, but he is usually referred to as \"\u1f41 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2\" (\"the author of Elements\").[32] In the Middle Ages, some scholars contended Euclid was not a historical personage and that his name arose from a corruption of Greek mathematical terms.[33]/n/nEuclid is best known for his thirteen-book treatise, the Elements (Greek: \u03a3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u1fd6\u03b1; Stoicheia), considered his magnum opus.[3][35] Much of its content originates from earlier mathematicians, including Eudoxus, Hippocrates of Chios, Thales and Theaetetus, while other theorems are mentioned by Plato and Aristotle.[36] It is difficult to differentiate the work of Euclid from that of his predecessors, especially because the Elements essentially superseded much earlier and now-lost Greek mathematics.[37][h] The classicist Markus Asper concludes that \"apparently Euclid's achievement consists of assembling accepted mathematical knowledge into a cogent order and adding new proofs to fill in the gaps\" and the mathematician Serafina Cuomo described it as a \"reservoir of results\".[38][36] Despite this, Sialaros furthers that \"the remarkably tight structure of the Elements reveals authorial control beyond the limits of a mere editor\".[9]/nThe Elements does not exclusively discuss geometry as is sometimes believed.[37] It is traditionally divided into three topics: plane geometry (books 1\u20136), basic number theory (books 7\u201310:) and solid geometry (books 11\u201313)\u2014though book 5 (on proportions) and 10 (on irrational lines) do not exactly fit this scheme.[39][40] The heart of the text is the theorems scattered throughout.[35] Using Aristotle's terminology, these may be generally separated into two categories: \"first principles\" and \"second principles\".[41] The first group includes statements labeled as a \"definition\" (Greek: \u1f45\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 or \u1f41\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2), \"postulate\" (\u03b1\u1f34\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u200e), or a \"common notion\" (\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u1f74 \u1f14\u03bd\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1);[41][42] only the first book includes postulates\u2014later known as axioms\u2014and common notions.[37][i] The second group consists of propositions, presented alongside mathematical proofs and diagrams.[41][j] It is unknown if Euclid intended the Elements as a textbook, but its method of presentation makes it a natural fit.[9] As a whole, the authorial voice remains general and impersonal.[36]/nBook 1 of the Elements is foundational for the entire text.[37] It begins with a series of 20 definitions for basic geometric concepts such as lines, angles and various regular polygons.[45] Euclid then presents 10 assumptions (see table, right), grouped into five postulates (axioms) and five common notions.[46][l] These assumptions are intended to provide the logical basis for every subsequent theorem, i.e. serve as an axiomatic system.[47][m] The common notions exclusively concern the comparison of magnitudes.[49] While postulates 1 through 4 are relatively straight forward,[n] the 5th is known as the parallel postulate and particularly famous.[49][o]/nBook 1 also includes 48 propositions, which can be loosely divided into those concerning basic theorems and constructions of plane geometry and triangle congruence (1\u201326); parallel lines (27\u201334); the area of triangles and parallelograms (35\u201345); and the Pythagorean theorem (46\u201348).[49] The last of these includes the earliest surviving proof of the Pythagorean theorem, described by Sialaros as \"remarkably delicate\".[41]/nBook 2 is traditionally understood as concerning \"geometric algebra\", though this interpretation has been heavily debated since the 1970s; critics describe the characterization as anachronistic, since the foundations of even nascent algebra occurred many centuries later.[41] The second book has a more focused scope and mostly provides algebraic theorems to accompany various geometric shapes.[37][49] It focuses on the area of rectangles and squares (see Quadrature), and leads up to a geometric precursor of the law of cosines./nBook 3 focuses on circles, while the 4th discusses regular polygons, especially the pentagon.[37][51] Book 5 is among the work's most important sections and presents what is usually termed as the \"general theory of proportion\".[52][p] Book 6 utilizes the \"theory of ratios\" in the context of plane geometry.[37] It is built almost entirely of its first proposition:[53] \"Triangles and parallelograms which are under the same height are to one another as their bases\".[54]/nFrom Book 7 onwards, the mathematician Benno Artmann\u00a0[de] notes that \"Euclid starts afresh. Nothing from the preceding books is used\".[55] Number theory is covered by books 7 to 10, the former beginning with a set of 22 definitions for parity, prime numbers and other arithmetic-related concepts.[37] Book 7 includes the Euclidean algorithm, a method for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.[55] The 8th book discusses geometric progressions, while book 9 includes the proposition, now called Euclid's theorem, that there are infinitely many prime numbers.[37]/nOf the Elements, book 10 is by far the largest and most complex, dealing with irrational numbers in the context of magnitudes.[41]/nThe final three books (11\u201313) primarily discuss solid geometry.[39] By introducing a list of 37 definitions, Book 11 contextualizes the next two.[56] Although its foundational character resembles Book 1, unlike the latter it features no axiomatic system or postulates.[56] The three sections of Book 11 include content on solid geometry (1\u201319), solid angles (20\u201323) and parallelepipedal solids (24\u201337).[56]/nIn addition to the Elements, at least five works of Euclid have survived to the present day. They follow the same logical structure as Elements, with definitions and proved propositions./nFour other works are credibly attributed to Euclid, but have been lost.[9]/nEuclid's works can be found in cultural institutions across the world. Many of these editions are digitised and available for public consultation./nEuclid is generally considered with Archimedes and Apollonius of Perga as among the greatest mathematicians of antiquity.[11] Many commentators cite him as one of the most influential figures in the history of mathematics.[2] The geometrical system established by the Elements long dominated the field; however, today that system is often referred to as 'Euclidean geometry' to distinguish it from other non-Euclidean geometries discovered in the early 19th century.[63] Among Euclid's many namesakes are the European Space Agency's (ESA) Euclid spacecraft,[64] the lunar crater Euclides,[65] and the minor planet 4354 Euclides.[66]/nThe Elements is often considered after the Bible as the most frequently translated, published, and studied book in the Western World's history.[63] With Aristotle's Metaphysics, the Elements is perhaps the most successful ancient Greek text, and was the dominant mathematical textbook in the Medieval Arab and Latin worlds.[63]/nThe first English edition of the Elements was published in 1570 by Henry Billingsley and John Dee.[27] The mathematician Oliver Byrne published a well-known version of the Elements  in 1847 entitled The First Six Books of the Elements of Euclid in Which Coloured Diagrams and Symbols Are Used Instead of Letters for the Greater Ease of Learners, which included colored diagrams intended to increase its pedagogical effect.[67] David Hilbert authored a modern axiomatization of the Elements.[68]", "70460533": "Alison Ramage is a British applied mathematician and numerical analyst specialising in preconditioning methods for numerical linear algebra, and their applications to the numerical solution of partial differential equations.

As an engineer and inventor, he improved the design of telescopes and invented the pendulum clock, the most accurate timekeeper for almost 300 years. A talented mathematician and physicist, his works contain the first idealization of a physical problem by a set of mathematical parameters,[6] and the first mathematical and mechanistic explanation of an unobservable physical phenomenon.[7]/nHuygens first identified the correct laws of elastic collision in his work De Motu Corporum ex Percussione, completed in 1656 but published posthumously in 1703.[8] In 1659, Huygens derived geometrically the formula in classical mechanics for the centrifugal force in his work De vi Centrifuga, a decade before Newton.[9] In optics, he is best known for his wave theory of light, which he described in his Trait\u00e9 de la Lumi\u00e8re (1690). His theory of light was initially rejected in favour of Newton's corpuscular theory of light, until Augustin-Jean Fresnel adapted Huygens's principle to give a complete explanation of the rectilinear propagation and diffraction effects of light in 1821. Today this principle is known as the Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle./nHuygens invented the pendulum clock in 1657, which he patented the same year. His horological research resulted in an extensive analysis of the pendulum in Horologium Oscillatorium (1673), regarded as one of the most important 17th century works on mechanics.[6] While it contains descriptions of clock designs, most of the book is an analysis of pendular motion and a theory of curves. In 1655, Huygens began grinding lenses with his brother Constantijn to build refracting telescopes. He discovered Saturn's biggest moon, Titan, and was the first to explain Saturn's strange appearance as due to \"a thin, flat ring, nowhere touching, and inclined to the ecliptic.\"[10] In 1662 Huygens developed what is now called the Huygenian eyepiece, a telescope with two lenses to diminish the amount of dispersion.[11]/nAs a mathematician, Huygens developed the theory of evolutes and wrote on games of chance and the problem of points in Van Rekeningh in Spelen van Gluck, which Frans van Schooten translated and published as De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae (1657).[12] The use of expected values by Huygens and others would later inspire Jacob Bernoulli's work on probability theory.[13][14]/nChristiaan Huygens was born on 14 April 1629 in The Hague, into a rich and influential Dutch family,[15][16] the second son of Constantijn Huygens. Christiaan was named after his paternal grandfather.[17][18] His mother, Suzanna van Baerle, died shortly after giving birth to Huygens's sister.[19] The couple had five children: Constantijn (1628), Christiaan (1629), Lodewijk (1631), Philips (1632) and Suzanna (1637).[20]/nConstantijn Huygens was a diplomat and advisor to the House of Orange, in addition to being a poet and a musician. He corresponded widely with intellectuals across Europe; his friends included Galileo Galilei, Marin Mersenne, and Ren\u00e9 Descartes.[21] Christiaan was educated at home until the age of sixteen, and from a young age liked to play with miniatures of mills and other machines. From his father he received a liberal education, studying languages, music, history, geography, mathematics, logic, and rhetoric, alongside dancing, fencing and horse riding.[17][20]/nIn 1644, Huygens had as his mathematical tutor Jan Jansz Stampioen, who assigned the 15-year-old a demanding reading list on contemporary science.[22] Descartes was later impressed by his skills in geometry, as was Mersenne, who christened him the \"new Archimedes.\"[23][16][24]/nAt sixteen years of age, Constantijn sent Huygens to study law and mathematics at Leiden University, where he studied from May 1645 to March 1647.[17] Frans van Schooten was an academic at Leiden from 1646, and became a private tutor to Huygens and his elder brother, Constantijn Jr., replacing Stampioen on the advice of Descartes.[25][26] Van Schooten brought Huygens's mathematical education up to date, introducing him to the work of Vi\u00e8te, Descartes, and Fermat.[27]/nAfter two years, starting in March 1647, Huygens continued his studies at the newly founded Orange College, in Breda, where his father was a curator. Constantijn Huygens was closely involved in the new College, which lasted only to 1669; the rector was Andr\u00e9 Rivet.[28] Christiaan Huygens lived at the home of the jurist Johann Henryk Dauber while attending college, and had mathematics classes with the English lecturer John Pell. His time in Breda ended around the time when his brother Lodewijk, who was enrolled at the school, duelled with another student.[5][29] Huygens left Breda after completing his studies in August 1649 and had a stint as a diplomat on a mission with Henry, Duke of Nassau.[17] It took him to Bentheim, then Flensburg. He took off for Denmark, visited Copenhagen and Helsing\u00f8r, and hoped to cross the \u00d8resund to visit Descartes in Stockholm. It was not to be.[5][30]/nAlthough his father Constantijn had wished his son Christiaan to be a diplomat, circumstances kept him from becoming so. The First Stadtholderless Period that began in 1650 meant that the House of Orange was no longer in power, removing Constantijn's influence. Further, he realized that his son had no interest in such a career.[31]/nHuygens generally wrote in French or Latin.[32] In 1646, while still a college student at Leiden, he began a correspondence with his father's friend, Marin Mersenne, who died soon afterwards in 1648.[17] Mersenne wrote to Constantijn on his son's talent for mathematics, and flatteringly compared him to Archimedes on 3 January 1647.[33]/nThe letters show Huygens's early interest in mathematics. In October 1646 there is the suspension bridge and the demonstration that a hanging chain is not a parabola, as Galileo thought.[34] Huygens would later label that curve the catenaria (catenary) in 1690 while corresponding with Gottfried Leibniz.[35]/nIn the next two years (1647\u201348), Huygens's letters to Mersenne covered various topics, including a mathematical proof of the law of free fall, the claim by Gr\u00e9goire de Saint-Vincent of circle quadrature, which Huygens showed to be wrong, the rectification of the ellipse, projectiles, and the vibrating string.[36] Some of Mersenne's concerns at the time, such as the cycloid (he sent Huygens Torricelli's treatise on the curve), the centre of oscillation, and the gravitational constant, were matters Huygens only took seriously later in the 17th century.[6] Mersenne had also written on musical theory. Huygens preferred meantone temperament; he innovated in 31 equal temperament (which was not itself a new idea but known to Francisco de Salinas), using logarithms to investigate it further and show its close relation to the meantone system.[37]/nIn 1654, Huygens returned to his father's house in The Hague, and was able to devote himself entirely to research.[17] The family had another house, not far away at Hofwijck, and he spent time there during the summer. Despite being very active, his scholarly life did not allow him to escape bouts of depression.[38]/nSubsequently, Huygens developed a broad range of correspondents, though with some difficulty after 1648 due to the five-year Fronde in France. Visiting Paris in 1655, Huygens called on Ismael Boulliau to introduce himself, who took him to see Claude Mylon.[39] The Parisian group of savants that had gathered around Mersenne held together into the 1650s, and Mylon, who had assumed the secretarial role, took some trouble to keep Huygens in touch.[40] Through Pierre de Carcavi Huygens corresponded in 1656 with Pierre de Fermat, whom he admired greatly. The experience was bittersweet and somewhat puzzling since it became clear that Fermat had dropped out of the research mainstream, and his priority claims could probably not be made good in some cases. Besides, Huygens was looking by then to apply mathematics to physics, while Fermat's concerns ran to purer topics.[41]/nLike some of his contemporaries, Huygens was often slow to commit his results and discoveries to print, preferring to disseminate his work through letters instead.[42] In his early days, his mentor Frans van Schooten provided technical feedback and was cautious for the sake of his reputation.[43]/nBetween 1651 and 1657, Huygens published a number of works that showed his talent for mathematics and his mastery of classical and analytical geometry, increasing his reach and reputation among mathematicians.[33] Around the same time, Huygens began to question Descartes's laws of collision, which were largely wrong, deriving the correct laws algebraically and later by way of geometry.[44] He showed that, for any system of bodies, the centre of gravity of the system remains the same in velocity and direction, which Huygens called the conservation of \"quantity of movement\". While others at the time were studying impact, Huygens's theory of collisions was more general.[5] These results became the main reference point and the focus for further debates through correspondence and in a short article in Journal des S\u00e7avans but would remain unknown to a larger audience until the publication of De Motu Corporum ex Percussione (Concerning the motion of colliding bodies) in 1703.[45][44]/nIn addition to his mathematical and mechanical works, Huygens made important scientific discoveries: he was the first to identify Titan as one of Saturn's moons in 1655, invented the pendulum clock in 1657, and explained Saturn's strange appearance as due to a ring in 1659; all these discoveries brought him fame across Europe.[17] On 3 May 1661, Huygens, together with astronomer Thomas Streete and Richard Reeve, observed the planet Mercury transit over the Sun using Reeve's telescope in London.[46] Streete then debated the published record of Hevelius, a controversy mediated by Henry Oldenburg.[47] Huygens passed to Hevelius a manuscript of Jeremiah Horrocks on the transit of Venus in 1639, printed for the first time in 1662.[48]/nIn that same year, Sir Robert Moray sent Huygens John Graunt's life table, and shortly after Huygens and his brother Lodewijk dabbled on life expectancy.[42][49] Huygens eventually created the first graph of a continuous distribution function under the assumption of a uniform death rate, and used it to solve problems in joint annuities.[50] Contemporaneously, Huygens, who played the harpsichord, took an interest in Simon Stevin's theories on music; however, he showed very little concern to publish his theories on consonance, some of which were lost for centuries.[51][52] For his contributions to science, the Royal Society of London elected Huygens a Fellow in 1665, making him its first foreign member when he was just 36 years old.[53]/nThe Montmor Academy, started in the mid-1650s, was the form the old Mersenne circle took after his death.[54] Huygens took part in its debates and supported those favouring experimental demonstration as a check on amateurish attitudes.[55] He visited Paris a third time in 1663; when the Montmor Academy closed down the next year, Huygens advocated for a more Baconian program in science. Two years later, in 1666, he moved to Paris on an invitation to fill a leadership position at King Louis XIV's new French Acad\u00e9mie des sciences.[56]/nWhile at the Acad\u00e9mie in Paris, Huygens had an important patron and correspondent in Jean-Baptiste Colbert, First Minister to Louis XIV.[57] However, his relationship with the French Acad\u00e9mie was not always easy, and in 1670 Huygens, seriously ill, chose Francis Vernon to carry out a donation of his papers to the Royal Society in London, should he die.[58] However, the aftermath of the Franco-Dutch War (1672\u201378), and particularly England's role in it, may have damaged his later relationship with the Royal Society.[59] Robert Hooke, as a Royal Society representative, lacked the finesse to handle the situation in 1673.[60]/nThe physicist and inventor Denis Papin was an assistant to Huygens from 1671.[61] One of their projects, which did not bear fruit directly, was the gunpowder engine.[62][63] Huygens made further astronomical observations at the Acad\u00e9mie using the observatory recently completed in 1672. He introduced Nicolaas Hartsoeker to French scientists such as Nicolas Malebranche and Giovanni Cassini in 1678.[5][64]/nThe young diplomat Leibniz met Huygens while visiting Paris in 1672 on a vain mission to meet the French Foreign Minister Arnauld de Pomponne. Leibniz was working on a calculating machine at the time and, after a short visit to London in early 1673, he was tutored in mathematics by Huygens until 1676.[65] An extensive correspondence ensued over the years, in which Huygens showed at first reluctance to accept the advantages of Leibniz's infinitesimal calculus.[66]/nHuygens moved back to The Hague in 1681 after suffering another bout of serious depressive illness. In 1684, he published Astroscopia Compendiaria on his new tubeless aerial telescope. He attempted to return to France in 1685 but the revocation of the Edict of Nantes precluded this move. His father died in 1687, and he inherited Hofwijck, which he made his home the following year.[31]/nOn his third visit to England, Huygens met Isaac Newton in person on 12 June 1689. They spoke about Iceland spar, and subsequently corresponded about resisted motion.[67]/nHuygens returned to mathematical topics in his last years and observed the acoustical phenomenon now known as flanging in 1693.[68] Two years later, on 8 July 1695, Huygens died in The Hague and was buried, like his father before him, in an unmarked grave at the Grote Kerk.[69]/nHuygens never married.[70]/nHuygens first became internationally known for his work in mathematics, publishing a number of important results that drew the attention of many European geometers.[71] Huygens's preferred method in his published works was that of Archimedes, though he made use of Descartes's analytic geometry and Fermat's infinitesimal techniques more extensively in his private notebooks.[17][27]/nHuygens's first publication was Theoremata de Quadratura Hyperboles, Ellipsis et Circuli (Theorems on the quadrature of the hyperbola, ellipse, and circle), published by the Elzeviers in Leiden in 1651.[42] The first part of the work contained theorems for computing the areas of hyperbolas, ellipses, and circles that paralleled Archimedes's work on conic sections, particularly his Quadrature of the Parabola.[33] The second part included a refutation to Gr\u00e9goire de Saint-Vincent's claims on circle quadrature, which he had discussed with Mersenne earlier./nHuygens demonstrated that the centre of gravity of a segment of any hyperbola, ellipse, or circle was directly related to the area of that segment. He was then able to show the relationships between triangles inscribed in conic sections and the centre of gravity for those sections. By generalizing these theorems to cover all conic sections, Huygens extended classical methods to generate new results.[17]/nQuadrature was a live issue in the 1650s and, through Mylon, Huygens intervened in the discussion of the mathematics of Thomas Hobbes. Persisting in trying to explain the errors Hobbes had fallen into, he made an international reputation.[72]/nHuygens's next publication was De Circuli Magnitudine Inventa (New findings in the measurement of the circle), published in 1654. In this work, Huygens was able to narrow the gap between the circumscribed and inscribed polygons found in Archimedes's Measurement of the Circle, showing that the ratio of the circumference to its diameter or \u03c0 must lie in the first third of that interval.[42]/nUsing a technique equivalent to Richardson extrapolation,[73] Huygens was able to shorten the inequalities used in Archimedes's method; in this case, by using the centre of the gravity of a segment of a parabola, he was able to approximate the centre of gravity of a segment of a circle, resulting in a faster and accurate approximation of the circle quadrature.[74] From these theorems, Huygens obtained two set of values for \u03c0: the first between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927, and the second between 3.1415926533 and 3.1415926538.[75]/nHuygens also showed that, in the case of the hyperbola, the same approximation with parabolic segments produces a quick and simple method to calculate logarithms.[76] He appended a collection of solutions to classical problems at the end of the work under the title Illustrium Quorundam Problematum Constructiones (Construction of some illustrious problems).[42]/nHuygens became interested in games of chance after he visited Paris in 1655 and encountered the work of Fermat, Blaise Pascal and Girard Desargues years earlier.[77] He eventually published what was, at the time, the most coherent presentation of a mathematical approach to games of chance in De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae (On reasoning in games of chance).[78][79] Frans van Schooten translated the original Dutch manuscript into Latin and published it in his Exercitationum Mathematicarum (1657).[80][12]/nThe work contains early game-theoretic ideas and deals in particular with the problem of points.[14][12] Huygens took from Pascal the concepts of a \"fair game\" and equitable contract (i.e., equal division when the chances are equal), and extended the argument to set up a non-standard theory of expected values.[81] His success in applying algebra to the realm of chance, which hitherto seemed inaccessible to mathematicians, demonstrated the power of combining Euclidean synthetic proofs with the symbolic reasoning found in the works of Vi\u00e8te and Descartes.[82]/nHuygens included five challenging problems at the end of the book that became the standard test for anyone wishing to display their mathematical skill in games of chance for the next sixty years.[83] People who worked on these problems included Abraham de Moivre, Jacob Bernoulli, Johannes Hudde, Baruch Spinoza, and Leibniz./nHuygens had earlier completed a manuscript in the manner of Archimedes's On Floating Bodies entitled De Iis quae Liquido Supernatant (About liquids floating above parts). It was written around 1650 and was made up of three books. Although he sent the completed work to Frans van Schooten for feedback, in the end Huygens chose not to publish it, and at one point suggested it be burned.[33][84] Some of the results found here were not rediscovered until the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.[8]/nHuygens first re-derives Archimedes's solutions for the stability of the sphere and the paraboloid by a clever application of Torricelli's principle (i.e., that bodies in a system move only if their centre of gravity descends).[85] He then proves the general theorem that, for a floating body in equilibrium, the distance between its centre of gravity and its submerged portion its at a minimum.[8] Huygens uses this theorem to arrive at original solutions for the stability of floating cones, parallelepipeds, and cylinders, in some cases through a full cycle of rotation.[86] His approach was thus equivalent to the principle of virtual work. Huygens was also the first to recognize that, for these homogeneous solids, their specific weight and their aspect ratio are the essentials parameters of hydrostatic stability.[87][88]/nHuygens was the leading European natural philosopher between Descartes and Newton.[17][89] However, unlike many of his contemporaries, Huygens had no taste for grand theoretical or philosophical systems and generally avoided dealing with metaphysical issues (if pressed, he adhered to the Cartesian philosophy of his time).[7][33] Instead, Huygens excelled in extending the work of his predecessors, such as Galileo, to derive solutions to unsolved physical problems that were amenable to mathematical analysis. In particular, he sought explanations that relied on contact between bodies and avoided action at a distance.[17][90]/nIn common with Robert Boyle and Jacques Rohault, Huygens advocated an experimentally oriented, mechanical natural philosophy during his Paris years.[91] Already in his first visit to England in 1661, Huygens had learnt about Boyle's air pump experiments during a meeting at Gresham College. Shortly afterwards, he reevaluated Boyle's experimental design and developed a series of experiments meant to test a new hypothesis.[92] It proved a yearslong process that brought to the surface a number of experimental and theoretical issues, and which ended around the time he became a Fellow of the Royal Society.[93] Despite the replication of results of Boyle's experiments trailing off messily, Huygens came to accept Boyle's view of the void against the Cartesian denial of it.[94]/nNewton's influence on John Locke was mediated by Huygens, who assured Locke that Newton's mathematics was sound, leading to Locke's acceptance of a corpuscular-mechanical physics.[95]/nThe general approach of the mechanical philosophers was to postulate theories of the kind now called \"contact action.\" Huygens adopted this method but not without seeing its limitations,[96] while Leibniz, his student in Paris, later abandoned it.[97] Understanding the universe this way made the theory of collisions central to physics, as only explanations that involved matter in motion could be truly intelligible. While Huygens was influenced by the Cartesian approach, he was less doctrinaire.[98] He studied elastic collisions in the 1650s but delayed publication for over a decade.[99]/nHuygens concluded quite early that Descartes's laws for elastic collisions were largely wrong, and he formulated the correct laws, including the conservation of the product of mass times the square of the speed for hard bodies, and the conservation of quantity of motion in one direction for all bodies.[100] An important step was his recognition of the Galilean invariance of the problems.[101] Huygens had worked out the laws of collision from 1652 to 1656 in a manuscript entitled De Motu Corporum ex Percussione, though his results took many years to be circulated. In 1661, he passed them on in person to William Brouncker and Christopher Wren in London.[102] What Spinoza wrote to Henry Oldenburg about them in 1666, during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, was guarded.[103] The war ended in 1667, and Huygens announced his results to the Royal Society in 1668. He later published them in the Journal des S\u00e7avans in 1669.[99]/nIn 1659 Huygens found the constant of gravitational acceleration and stated what is now known as the second of Newton's laws of motion in quadratic form.[104] He derived geometrically the now standard formula for the centrifugal force, exerted on an object when viewed in a rotating frame of reference, for instance when driving around a curve. In modern notation:/nwith m the mass of the object, \u03c9 the angular velocity, and r the radius.[8] Huygens collected his results in a treatise under the title De vi Centrifuga, unpublished until 1703, where the kinematics of free fall were used to produce the first generalized conception of force prior to Newton.[105]/nThe general idea for the centrifugal force, however, was published in 1673 and was a significant step in studying orbits in astronomy. It enabled the transition from Kepler's third law of planetary motion to the inverse square law of gravitation.[106] Yet, the interpretation of Newton's work on gravitation by Huygens differed from that of Newtonians such as Roger Cotes: he did not insist on the a priori attitude of Descartes, but neither would he accept aspects of gravitational attractions that were not attributable in principle to contact between particles.[107]/nThe approach used by Huygens also missed some central notions of mathematical physics, which were not lost on others. In his work on pendulums Huygens came very close to the theory of simple harmonic motion; the topic, however, was covered fully for the first time by Newton in Book II of the Principia Mathematica (1687).[108] In 1678 Leibniz picked out of Huygens's work on collisions the idea of conservation law that Huygens had left implicit.[109]/nIn 1657, inspired by earlier research into pendulums as regulating mechanisms, Huygens invented the pendulum clock, which was a breakthrough in timekeeping and became the most accurate timekeeper for almost 300 years until the 1930s.[112] The pendulum clock was much more accurate than the existing verge and foliot clocks and was immediately popular, quickly spreading over Europe. Clocks prior to this would lose about 15 minutes per day, whereas Huygens's clock would lose about 15 seconds per day.[113] Although Huygens patented and contracted the construction of his clock designs to Salomon Coster in The Hague,[114] he did not make much money from his invention. Pierre S\u00e9guier refused him any French rights, while Simon Douw in Rotterdam and Ahasuerus Fromanteel in London copied his design in 1658.[115] The oldest known Huygens-style pendulum clock is dated 1657 and can be seen at the Museum Boerhaave in Leiden.[116][117][118][119]/nPart of the incentive for inventing the pendulum clock was to create an accurate marine chronometer that could be used to find longitude by celestial navigation during sea voyages. However, the clock proved unsuccessful as a marine timekeeper because the rocking motion of the ship disturbed the motion of the pendulum. In 1660, Lodewijk Huygens made a trial on a voyage to Spain, and reported that heavy weather made the clock useless. Alexander Bruce entered the field in 1662, and Huygens called in Sir Robert Moray and the Royal Society to mediate and preserve some of his rights.[120][116] Trials continued into the 1660s, the best news coming from a Royal Navy captain Robert Holmes operating against the Dutch possessions in 1664.[121] Lisa Jardine doubts that Holmes reported the results of the trial accurately, as Samuel Pepys expressed his doubts at the time.[122]/nA trial for the French Academy on an expedition to Cayenne ended badly. Jean Richer suggested correction for the figure of the Earth. By the time of the Dutch East India Company expedition of 1686 to the Cape of Good Hope, Huygens was able to supply the correction retrospectively.[123]/nSixteen years after the invention of the pendulum clock, in 1673, Huygens published his major work on horology entitled Horologium Oscillatorium: Sive de Motu Pendulorum ad Horologia Aptato Demonstrationes Geometricae (The Pendulum Clock: or Geometrical demonstrations concerning the motion of pendula as applied to clocks). It is the first modern work on mechanics where a physical problem is idealized by a set of parameters then analysed mathematically.[6]/nHuygens's motivation came from the observation, made by Mersenne and others, that pendulums are not quite isochronous: their period depends on their width of swing, with wide swings taking slightly longer than narrow swings.[124] He tackled this problem by finding the curve down which a mass will slide under the influence of gravity in the same amount of time, regardless of its starting point; the so-called tautochrone problem. By geometrical methods which anticipated the calculus, Huygens showed it to be a cycloid, rather than the circular arc of a pendulum's bob, and therefore that pendulums needed to move on a cycloid path in order to be isochronous. The mathematics necessary to solve this problem led Huygens to develop his theory of evolutes, which he presented in Part III of his Horologium Oscillatorium.[6][125]/nHe also solved a problem posed by Mersenne earlier: how to calculate the period of a pendulum made of an arbitrarily-shaped swinging rigid body. This involved discovering the centre of oscillation and its reciprocal relationship with the pivot point. In the same work, he analysed the conical pendulum, consisting of a weight on a cord moving in a circle, using the concept of centrifugal force.[6][126]/nHuygens was the first to derive the formula for the period of an ideal mathematical pendulum (with mass-less rod or cord and length much longer than its swing), in modern notation:/nwith T the period, l the length of the pendulum and g the gravitational acceleration. By his study of the oscillation period of compound pendulums Huygens made pivotal contributions to the development of the concept of moment of inertia.[127]/nHuygens also observed coupled oscillations: two of his pendulum clocks mounted next to each other on the same support often became synchronized, swinging in opposite directions. He reported the results by letter to the Royal Society, and it is referred to as \"an odd kind of sympathy\" in the Society's minutes.[128] This concept is now known as entrainment.[129]/nIn 1675, while investigating the oscillating properties of the cycloid, Huygens was able to transform a cycloidal pendulum into a vibrating spring through a combination of geometry and higher mathematics.[130] In the same year, Huygens designed a spiral balance spring and patented a pocket watch. These watches are notable for lacking a fusee for equalizing the mainspring torque. The implication is that Huygens thought his spiral spring would isochronize the balance in the same way that cycloid-shaped suspension curbs on his clocks would isochronize the pendulum.[131]/nHe later used spiral springs in more conventional watches, made for him by Thuret in Paris. Such springs are essential in modern watches with a detached lever escapement because they can be adjusted for isochronism. Watches in Huygens's time, however, employed the very ineffective verge escapement, which interfered with the isochronal properties of any form of balance spring, spiral or otherwise.[132]/nHuygens's design came around the same time as, though independently of, Robert Hooke's. Controversy over the priority of the balance spring persisted for centuries. In February 2006, a long-lost copy of Hooke's handwritten notes from several decades of Royal Society meetings was discovered in a cupboard in Hampshire, England, presumably tipping the evidence in Hooke's favour.[133][134]/nHuygens had a long-term interest in the study of light refraction and lenses or dioptrics.[135] From 1652 date the first drafts of a Latin treatise on the theory of dioptrics, known as the Tractatus, which contained a comprehensive and rigorous theory of the telescope. Huygens was one of the few to raise theoretical questions regarding the properties and working of the telescope, and almost the only one to direct his mathematical proficiency towards the actual instruments used in astronomy.[136]/nHuygens repeatedly announced its publication to his colleagues but ultimately postponed it in favor of a much more comprehensive treatment, now under the name of the Dioptrica.[23] It consisted of three parts. The first part focused on the general principles of refraction, the second dealt with spherical and chromatic aberration, while the third covered all aspects of the construction of telescopes and microscopes. In contrast to Descartes' dioptrics which treated only ideal (elliptical and hyperbolical) lenses, Huygens dealt exclusively with spherical lenses, which were the only kind that could really be made and incorporated in devices such as microscopes and telescopes.[137]/nHuygens also worked out practical ways to minimize the effects of spherical and chromatic aberration, such as long focal distances for the objective of a telescope, internal stops to reduce the aperture, and a new kind of ocular known as the Huygenian eyepiece.[137] The Dioptrica was never published in Huygens\u2019s lifetime and only appeared in press in 1703, when most of its contents were already familiar to the scientific world./nTogether with his brother Constantijn, Huygens began grinding his own lenses in 1655 in an effort to improve telescopes.[138] He designed in 1662 what is now called the Huygenian eyepiece, a set of two planoconvex lenses used as a telescope ocular.[139][140] Huygens's lenses were known to be of superb quality and polished consistently according to his specifications; however, his telescopes did not produce very sharp images, leading some to speculate that he might have suffered from near-sightedness.[141]/nLenses were also a common interest through which Huygens could meet socially in the 1660s with Spinoza, who ground them professionally. They had rather different outlooks on science, Spinoza being the more committed Cartesian, and some of their discussion survives in correspondence.[142] He encountered the work of Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, another lens grinder, in the field of microscopy which interested his father.[6] Huygens also investigated the use of lenses in projectors. He is credited as the inventor of the magic lantern, described in correspondence of 1659.[143] There are others to whom such a lantern device has been attributed, such as Giambattista della Porta and Cornelis Drebbel, though Huygens's design used lens for better projection (Athanasius Kircher has also been credited for that).[144]/nHuygens is especially remembered in optics for his wave theory of light, which he first communicated in 1678 to the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences in Paris. Originally a preliminary chapter of his Dioptrica, Huygens's theory was published in 1690 under the title Trait\u00e9 de la Lumi\u00e8re[145] (Treatise on light), and contains the first fully mathematized, mechanistic explanation of an unobservable physical phenomenon (i.e., light propagation).[7][146] Huygens refers to Ignace-Gaston Pardies, whose manuscript on optics helped him on his wave theory.[147]/nThe challenge at the time was to explain geometrical optics, as most physical optics phenomena (such as diffraction) had not been observed or appreciated as issues. Huygens had experimented in 1672 with double refraction (birefringence) in the Iceland spar (a calcite), a phenomenon discovered in 1669 by Rasmus Bartholin. At first, he could not elucidate what he found but was later able to explain it using his wavefront theory and concept of evolutes.[146] He also developed ideas on caustics.[6] Huygens assumes that the speed of light is finite, based on a report by Ole Christensen R\u00f8mer in 1677 but which Huygens is presumed to have already believed.[148] Huygens's theory posits light as radiating wavefronts, with the common notion of light rays depicting propagation normal to those wavefronts. Propagation of the wavefronts is then explained as the result of spherical waves being emitted at every point along the wave front (known today as the Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle).[149] It assumed an omnipresent ether, with transmission through perfectly elastic particles, a revision of the view of Descartes. The nature of light was therefore a longitudinal wave.[148]/nHis theory of light was not widely accepted, while Newton's rival corpuscular theory of light, as found in his Opticks (1704), gained more support. One strong objection to Huygens's theory was that longitudinal waves have only a single polarization which cannot explain the observed birefringence. However, Thomas Young's interference experiments in 1801, and Fran\u00e7ois Arago's detection of the Poisson spot in 1819, could not be explained through Newton's or any other particle theory, reviving Huygens's ideas and wave models. Fresnel became aware of Huygens's work and in 1821 was able to explain birefringence as a result of light being not a longitudinal (as had been assumed) but actually a transverse wave.[150] The thus-named Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle was the basis for the advancement of physical optics, explaining all aspects of light propagation until Maxwell's electromagnetic theory culminated in the development of quantum mechanics and the discovery of the photon.[137][151]/nIn 1655, Huygens discovered the first of Saturn's moons, Titan, and observed and sketched the Orion Nebula using a refracting telescope with a 43x magnification of his own design.[11][10] Huygens succeeded in subdividing the nebula into different stars (the brighter interior now bears the name of the Huygenian region in his honour), and discovered several interstellar nebulae and some double stars.[152] He was also the first to propose that the appearance of Saturn, which have baffled astronomers, was due to \"a thin, flat ring, nowhere touching, and inclined to the ecliptic\u201d.[153]/nMore than three years later, in 1659, Huygens published his theory and findings in Systema Saturnium. It is considered the most important work on telescopic astronomy since Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius fifty years earlier.[154] Much more than a report on Saturn, Huygens provided measurements for the relative distances of the planets from the Sun, introduced the concept of the micrometer, and showed a method to measure angular diameters of planets, which finally allowed the telescope to be used as an instrument to measure (rather than just sighting) astronomical objects.[155] He was also the first to question the authority of Galileo in telescopic matters, a sentiment that was to be common in the years following its publication./nIn the same year, Huygens was able to observe Syrtis Major, a volcanic plain on Mars. He used repeated observations of the movement of this feature over the course of a number of days to estimate the length of day on Mars, which he did quite accurately to 24 1/2 hours. This figure is only a few minutes off of the actual length of the Martian day of 24 hours, 37 minutes.[156]/nAt the instigation of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Huygens undertook the task of constructing a mechanical planetarium that could display all the planets and their moons then known circling around the Sun. Huygens completed his design in 1680 and had his clockmaker Johannes van Ceulen built it the following year. However, Colbert passed away in the interim and Huygens never got to deliver his planetarium to the French Academy of Sciences as the new minister, Fran\u00e7ois-Michel le Tellier, decided not to renew Huygens's contract.[157][158]/nIn his design, Huygens made an ingenious use of continued fractions to find the best rational approximations by which he could choose the gears with the correct number of teeth. The ratio between two gears determined the orbital periods of two planets. To move the planets around the Sun, Huygens used a clock-mechanism that could go forwards and backwards in time. Huygens claimed his planetarium was more accurate that a similar device constructed by Ole R\u00f8mer around the same time, but his planetarium design was not published until after his death in the Opuscula Posthuma (1703).[157]/nShortly before his death in 1695, Huygens completed his most speculative work entitled Cosmotheoros. At his direction, it was to be published only posthumously by his brother, which Constantijn Jr. did in 1698.[159] In this work, Huygens speculated on the existence of extraterrestrial life, which he imagined similar to that on Earth. Such speculations were not uncommon at the time, justified by Copernicanism or the plenitude principle, but Huygens went into greater detail.[160] However, it did so without the benefit of understanding Newton's laws of gravitation, or the fact that the atmospheres on other planets are composed of different gases.[161] Cosmotheoros, translated into English as The celestial worlds discover\u2019d, has been seen as part of speculative fiction in the tradition of Francis Godwin, John Wilkins, and Cyrano de Bergerac. Huygens's work was fundamentally utopian and owes some inspiration from the cosmography and planetary speculation of Peter Heylin.[162][163]/nHuygens wrote that availability of water in liquid form was essential for life and that the properties of water must vary from planet to planet to suit the temperature range. He took his observations of dark and bright spots on the surfaces of Mars and Jupiter to be evidence of water and ice on those planets.[164] He argued that extraterrestrial life is neither confirmed nor denied by the Bible, and questioned why God would create the other planets if they were not to serve a greater purpose than that of being admired from Earth. Huygens postulated that the great distance between the planets signified that God had not intended for beings on one to know about the beings on the others, and had not foreseen how much humans would advance in scientific knowledge.[165]/nIt was also in this book that Huygens published his estimates for the relative sizes of the solar system and his method for calculating stellar distances.[5] He made a series of smaller holes in a screen facing the Sun, until he estimated the light was of the same intensity as that of the star Sirius. He then calculated that the angle of this hole was 1/27,664th the diameter of the Sun, and thus it was about 30,000 times as far away, on the (incorrect) assumption that Sirius is as luminous as the Sun. The subject of photometry remained in its infancy until the time of Pierre Bouguer and Johann Heinrich Lambert.[166]/nHuygens has been called the first theoretical physicist and a founder of modern mathematical physics.[167][168] Although his influence was considerable during his lifetime, it began to fade shortly after his death. His skills as a geometer and mechanical ingenuity elicited the admiration of many of his contemporaries, including Newton, Leibniz, l'H\u00f4pital, and the Bernoullis.[42] For his work in physics, Huygens has been deemed one of the greatest scientists in the Scientific Revolution, rivaled only by Newton in both depth of insight and the number of results obtained.[4][169] Huygens also helped develop the institutional frameworks for scientific research on the European continent, making him a leading actor in the establishment of modern science.[170]/nIn mathematics, Huygens mastered the methods of ancient Greek geometry, particularly the work of Archimedes, and was an adept user of the analytic geometry and infinitesimal techniques of Descartes and Fermat.[84] His mathematical style can be best described as geometrical infinitesimal analysis of curves and of motion. Drawing inspiration and imagery from mechanics, it remained pure mathematics in form.[71] Huygens brought this type of geometrical analysis to a close, as more mathematicians turned away from classical geometry to the calculus for handling infinitesimals, limit processes, and motion.[38]/nHuygens was moreover able to fully employ mathematics to answer questions of physics. Often this entailed introducing a simple model for describing a complicated situation, then analyzing it starting from simple arguments to their logical consequences, developing the necessary mathematics along the way. As he wrote at the end of a draft of De vi Centrifuga:[33]/nWhatever you will have supposed not impossible either concerning gravity or motion or any other matter, if then you prove something concerning the magnitude of a line, surface, or body, it will be true; as for instance, Archimedes on the quadrature of the parabola, where the tendency of heavy objects has been assumed to act through parallel lines./nHuygens favoured axiomatic presentations of his results, which require rigorous methods of geometric demonstration: although he allowed levels of uncertainty in the selection of primary axioms and hypotheses, the proofs of theorems derived from these could never be in doubt.[33] Huygens's style of publication exerted an influence in Newton's presentation of his own major works.[171][172]/nBesides the application of mathematics to physics and physics to mathematics, Huygens relied on mathematics as methodology, specifically its ability to generate new knowledge about the world.[173] Unlike Galileo, who used mathematics primarily as rhetoric or synthesis, Huygens consistently employed mathematics as a method to discover and develop theories covering various phenomena in mechanics, and insisted that the reduction of the physical to the geometrical satisfy exacting standards of fit between the real and the ideal.[124] In demanding such mathematical tractability and precision, Huygens set an example for eighteenth-century scientists such as Johann Bernoulli, Jean le Rond d'Alembert, and Charles-Augustin de Coulomb.[33][167]/nAlthough never intended for publication, Huygens made use of algebraic expressions to represent physical entities in a handful of his manuscripts on collisions.[44] This would make him one of the first to employ mathematical formulae to describe relationships in physics, as it is done today.[5] Huygens also came close to the modern idea of limit while working on his Dioptrica, though he never used the notion outside geometrical optics.[174]/nHuygens's standing as the greatest scientist in Europe was eclipsed by Newton's at the end of the seventeenth century, despite the fact that, as Hugh Aldersey-Williams notes, \"Huygens's achievement exceeds that of Newton in some important respects\".[175] Although his journal publications anticipated the form of the modern scientific article,[92] his persistent classicism and reluctance to publish his work did much to diminish his influence in the aftermath of the Scientific Revolution, as adherents of Leibniz\u2019 calculus and Newton's physics took centre stage.[38][84]/nHuygens's analyses of curves that satisfy certain physical properties, such as the cycloid, led to later studies of many other such curves like the caustic, the brachistochrone, the sail curve, and the catenary.[24][35] His application of mathematics to physics, such as in his studies of impact and birefringence, would inspire new developments in mathematical physics and rational mechanics in the following centuries (albeit in the new language of the calculus).[7] Additionally, Huygens developed the oscillating timekeeping mechanisms, the pendulum and the balance spring, that have been used ever since in mechanical watches and clocks. These were the first reliable timekeepers fit for scientific use (e.g., to make accurate measurements of the inequality of the solar day, which was not possible before).[6][124] His work in this area foreshadowed the union of applied mathematics with mechanical engineering in the centuries that followed.[131]/nDuring his lifetime, Huygens and his father had a number of portraits commissioned. These included:/nThe European Space Agency spacecraft that landed on Titan, Saturn's largest moon, in 2005 was named after him.[178]/nA number of monuments to Christiaan Huygens can be found across important cities in the Netherlands, including Rotterdam, Delft, and Leiden./nSource(s):[17]/n!", "58533012": "Bernard Shiffman (born 23 June 1942) is an American mathematician, specializing in complex geometry and analysis of complex manifolds.[1]/nShiffman received in 1964 from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) a bachelor's degree and in 1968 from the University of California, Berkeley a PhD under Shiing-Shen Chern with thesis On the removal of singularities in several complex variables.[2] Shiffman was at MIT a C.L.E.

He formulated De Morgan's laws and introduced the term mathematical induction, making its idea rigorous.[1]/nAugustus De Morgan was born in Madurai, in the Carnatic region of India in 1806.[2][a] His father was Lieutenant-Colonel John De Morgan (1772\u20131816), who held various appointments in the service of the East India Company, and his mother, Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Dodson, 1776\u20131856), was the daughter of John Dodson and granddaughter of James Dodson, who computed a table of anti-logarithms (inverse logarithms).[3] Augustus De Morgan became blind in one eye a month or two after he was born. His family moved to England when Augustus was seven months old. As his father and grandfather had both been born in India, De Morgan used to say that he was neither English, nor Scottish, nor Irish, but a Briton \"unattached,\" using the technical term applied to an undergraduate of Oxford or Cambridge who is not a member of any one of the Colleges./nWhen De Morgan was ten years old, his father died.[2] Mrs. De Morgan resided at various places in the southwest of England, and her son received his primary education at various schools of no great account.[citation needed] His mathematical talents went unnoticed until he was fourteen, when a family friend discovered him making an elaborate drawing of a figure from one of Euclid's works with a ruler and compasses.[2]/nHe received his secondary education from Mr. Parsons, a fellow of Oriel College, Oxford, who preferred classics to mathematics. De Morgan's mother was an active and ardent member of the Church of England and wanted her son to become a clergyman, but by this time, De Morgan had begun to show his non-conforming disposition. He became an atheist.[4][5]/nThere is a word in our language with which I shall not confuse this subject, both on account of the dishonourable use which is frequently made of it, as an imputation thrown by one sect upon another, and of the variety of significations attached to it. I shall use the word Anti-Deism to signify the opinion that there does not exist a Creator who made and sustains the Universe./nIn 1823, at the age of sixteen, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge,[6] where met George Peacock and William Whewell, who became his lifelong friends. From the former, he derived an interest in the renovation of algebra, and from the latter, an interest in the renovation of logic\u2014the two subjects of his future life work. His college tutor was John Philips Higman, FRS./nAt college, he played the flute recreationally and was prominent in the musical clubs. His love of knowledge for its own sake interfered with training for the great mathematical race; as a consequence he came out fourth wrangler. This entitled him to the degree of Bachelor of Arts, but to take the higher degree of Master of Arts and thereby become eligible for a fellowship, he needed to pass a theological test. De Morgan felt a strong objection to signing any such test, although he had been brought up in the Church of England. Around 1875, the requirement of theological tests for academic degrees was abolished in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge Act 1859./nAs no career was open to him at his own university, he decided to go to the Bar and took up residence in London, but he much preferred teaching mathematics to reading law. About this time the movement for founding London University (now University College London) took shape. The two ancient universities of Oxford and Cambridge were so guarded by theological tests that no Jew or dissenter outside the Church of England could enter as a student, much less be appointed to any office. A body of liberal-minded men resolved to establish a university in London on the principle of religious neutrality. De Morgan, then 22 years old, was appointed professor of mathematics. His introductory lecture \"On the study of mathematics\" is a discourse upon mental education of permanent value, and has been recently reprinted in the United States.[citation needed]/nThe London University was a new institution, and the relations of the Council of management, the Senate of professors and the body of students were not well defined. A dispute arose between the professor of anatomy and his students, and because of the action taken by the council, several professors resigned, headed by De Morgan. Another professor of mathematics was appointed, who drowned a few years later. De Morgan had shown himself a prince of teachers: he was invited to return to his chair, where he stayed for thirty years./nThe same body of reformers\u2014headed by Lord Brougham, a Scotsman eminent both in science and politics who had instituted the London University\u2014founded a Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge around the same time. Its goal was to spread scientific and other knowledge with cheap and clearly written treatises by the best writers of the time. One of its most voluminous and effective writers was De Morgan. He wrote a great work, The Differential and Integral Calculus, which was published by the Society, and he wrote one-sixth of the articles in the Penny Cyclopedia, published by the Society, and issued in penny numbers. When De Morgan came to live in London, he found a congenial friend in William Frend, notwithstanding his mathematical heresy about negative quantities. Both were arithmeticians and actuaries, and their religious views were somewhat similar. Frend lived in what was then a suburb of London, in a country-house formerly occupied by Daniel Defoe and Isaac Watts. De Morgan with his flute was a welcome visitor./nThe London University of which De Morgan was a professor was a different institution from the University of London. The University of London was founded about ten years later by the Government for the purpose of granting degrees after examination, without any qualification as to residence. The London University was affiliated with the University of London as a teaching college, and its name was changed to University College. The University of London was not a success as an examining body; a teaching University was demanded. De Morgan was a highly successful mathematics teacher. It was his plan to lecture for an hour, and at the close of each lecture to give out a number of problems and examples that were illustrative of the lecture subject; his students were required to work on them and bring him the results, which he looked over and returned revised before the next lecture. In De Morgan's opinion, a thorough comprehension and mental assimilation of great principles far outweighed in importance any merely analytical dexterity in the application of half-understood principles to particular cases./nDuring this period, he also promoted the work of the self-taught Indian mathematician Ramchundra, who has been called De Morgan's Ramanujan. He supervised the publication in London of Ramchundra's book Treatise on Problems of Maxima and Minima in 1859. In his preface to that edition, De Morgan wrote:/nOn examining this work I saw in it, not merely merit worthy of encouragement, but merit of a peculiar kind, the encouragement of which, as it appeared to me, was likely to promote native effort towards the restoration of the native mind in India./nIn the same preface, he acknowledged his awareness of the Indian tradition of logic, and later wrote again, in 1860, of its significance:/n\"The two races which have founded the mathematics, those of the Sanscrit and Greek languages, have been the two which have independently formed systems of logic.[7]/nThough the sophistication of Indian logical thought had been brought to the attention of Western mathematicians by a number of authors beginning in the late-18th century, it is not known whether this had any influence on De Morgan's own work. Mary Boole, however, claimed a profound influence \u2013 via her uncle George Everest \u2013 of Indian thought in general and Indian logic, in particular, on George Boole, as well as on De Morgan and Charles Babbage:/nThink what must have been the effect of the intense Hinduizing of three such men as Babbage, De Morgan, and George Boole on the mathematical atmosphere of 1830\u201365. What share had it in generating the Vector Analysis and the mathematics by which investigations in physical science are now conducted?[8]/nJonardon Ganeri has observed that it was this period of the mid-nineteenth century pointed to by Mary Boole that saw George Boole and Augustus De Morgan make their pioneering applications of algebraic ideas to the formulation of logic (algebraic logic and Boolean logic), and has suggested that these figures were likely to have been aware of the Indian system of logic, and in turn, that their awareness of the shortcomings of propositional logic as it was then formulated may have contributed to their willingness to look beyond their own logical tradition.[9]/nAugustus was one of seven children, four of whom survived to adulthood./nIn the autumn of 1837, he married Sophia Elizabeth Frend (1809\u20131892), eldest daughter of William Frend (1757\u20131841) and Sarah Blackburne (1779\u2013?), a granddaughter of Francis Blackburne (1705\u20131787), Archdeacon of Cleveland.[10]/nDe Morgan had three sons and four daughters, including fairytale author Mary De Morgan. His eldest son was the potter William De Morgan. His second son George acquired distinction in mathematics at University College and the University of London. He and another like-minded alumnus conceived the idea of founding a mathematical society in London, where mathematical papers would be not only received (as by the Royal Society) but actually read and discussed. The first meeting was held in University College; De Morgan was the first president, his son the first secretary. It was the beginning of the London Mathematical Society./nIn 1866, the chair of mental philosophy in University College fell vacant. James Martineau, a Unitarian clergyman and professor of mental philosophy, was recommended formally by the Senate to the council, but in the Council there were some who objected to a Unitarian clergyman, and others who objected to theistic philosophy. A layman of the school of Bain and Spencer was appointed. De Morgan considered that the old standard of religious neutrality had been hauled down, and immediately resigned. He was now 60 years old. His pupils secured him a pension of \u00a3500 p.a., but misfortunes followed. Two years later his son George\u2014the \"younger Bernoulli\", as Augustus loved to hear him called, in allusion to the eminent father-and-son mathematicians of that name\u2014died. This blow was followed by the death of a daughter. Five years after his resignation from University College, De Morgan died of nervous prostration on March 18, 1871./nDe Morgan was a brilliant and witty writer, whether as a controversialist or as a correspondent. In his time, there flourished two Sir William Hamiltons who have often been conflated. One was Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet, a Scotsman, professor of logic and metaphysics at the University of Edinburgh; the other was a knight (that is, won the title), an Irishman, professor at astronomy in the University of Dublin./nBe it known unto you that I have discovered that you and the other Sir W. H. are reciprocal polars with respect to me (intellectually and morally, for the Scottish baronet is a polar bear, and you, I was going to say, are a polar gentleman). When I send a bit of investigation to Edinburgh, the W. H. of that ilk says I took it from him. When I send you one, you take it from me, generalize it at a glance, bestow it thus generalized upon society at large, and make me the second discoverer of a known theorem./nThe correspondence of De Morgan with Hamilton the mathematician extended over twenty-four years; it contains discussions not only of mathematical matters, but also of subjects of general interest. It is marked by geniality on the part of Hamilton and by wit on the part of De Morgan. The following is a specimen:/nHamilton wrote:/nMy copy of Berkeley's work is not mine; like Berkeley, you know, I am an Irishman./nDe Morgan replied:/nYour phrase 'my copy is not mine' is not a bull. It is perfectly good English to use the same word in two different senses in one sentence, particularly when there is usage. Incongruity of language is no bull, for it expresses meaning. But incongruity of ideas (as in the case of the Irishman who was pulling up the rope, and finding it did not finish, cried out that somebody had cut off the other end of it) is the genuine bull./nDe Morgan was full of personal peculiarities. On the occasion of the installation of his friend, Lord Brougham, as Rector of the University of Edinburgh, the Senate offered to confer on him the honorary degree of LL. D.; he declined the honour as a misnomer. He once printed his name: Augustus De Morgan, H \u2013 O \u2013 M \u2013 O \u2013 P \u2013 A \u2013 U \u2013 C \u2013 A \u2013 R \u2013 U \u2013 M \u2013 L \u2013 I \u2013 T \u2013 E \u2013 R \u2013 A \u2013 R \u2013 U \u2013 M (Latin for \"man of few letters\").[citation needed]/nHe disliked the provinces outside London, and while his family enjoyed the seaside, and men of science were having a good time at a meeting of the British Association in the country, he remained in the hot and dusty libraries of the metropolis. He said that he felt like Socrates, who declared that the farther he was from Athens the farther was he from happiness. He never sought to become a Fellow of the Royal Society, and he never attended a meeting of the Society; he said that he had no ideas or sympathies in common with the physical philosopher. His attitude was possibly due to his physical infirmity, which prevented him from being either an observer or an experimenter. He never voted at an election, and he never visited the House of Commons, the Tower of London or Westminster Abbey./nWere the writings of De Morgan, such as his contributions to the Useful Knowledge Society, published in the form of collected works, they would form a small library. Mainly through the efforts of Peacock and Whewell, a Philosophical Society had been inaugurated at Cambridge, and De Morgan contributed four memoirs to its transactions on the foundations of algebra, and an equal number on formal logic. The best presentation of his view of algebra is found in a volume, entitled Trigonometry and Double Algebra, published in 1849, and his earlier view of formal logic is found in a volume published in 1847. His most distinctive work is styled A Budget of Paradoxes; it originally appeared as letters in the columns of the Athen\u00e6um journal; it was revised and extended by De Morgan in the last years of his life, and was published posthumously by his widow./nGeorge Peacock's theory of algebra was much improved by D. F. Gregory, a younger member of the Cambridge School, who laid stress not on the permanence of equivalent forms, but on the permanence of certain formal laws. This new theory of algebra as the science of symbols and of their laws of combination was carried to its logical issue by De Morgan, and his doctrine on the subject is still followed by English algebraists in general. Thus George Chrystal founds his Textbook of Algebra on De Morgan's theory, although an attentive reader may remark that he practically abandons it when he takes up the subject of infinite series. De Morgan's theory is stated in his volume on Trigonometry and Double Algebra, where in Book II, Chapter II, headed \"On symbolic algebra,\" he writes:/nIn abandoning the meanings of symbols, we also abandon those of the words which describe them. Thus addition is to be, for the present, a sound void of sense. It is a mode of combination represented by \n\n\n\n+\n\n\n{\\displaystyle +}\n\n; when \n\n\n\n+\n\n\n{\\displaystyle +}\n\n receives its meaning, so also will the word addition. It is most important that the student should bear in mind that, with one exception, no word nor sign of arithmetic or algebra has one atom of meaning throughout this chapter, the object of which is symbols, and their laws of combination, giving a symbolic algebra which may hereafter become the grammar of a hundred distinct significant algebras. If any one were to assert that \n\n\n\n+\n\n\n{\\displaystyle +}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n{\\displaystyle -}\n\n might mean reward and punishment, and \n\n\n\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A}\n\n, \n\n\n\nB\n\n\n{\\displaystyle B}\n\n, \n\n\n\nC\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C}\n\n, etc. might stand for virtues and vices, the reader might believe him, or contradict him, as he pleases\u2014but not out of this chapter./nThe one exception above noted, which has some share of meaning, is the sign \n\n\n\n=\n\n\n{\\displaystyle =}\n\n placed between two symbols, as in \n\n\n\nA\n=\nB\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A=B}\n\n. It indicates that the two symbols have the same resulting meaning, by whatever different steps attained. That \n\n\n\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A}\n\n and \n\n\n\nB\n\n\n{\\displaystyle B}\n\n, if quantities, are the same amount of quantity; that if operations, they are of the same effect, etc./nDe Morgan's work entitled Trigonometry and Double Algebra[11] consists of two parts; the former of which is a treatise on trigonometry, and the latter a treatise on generalized algebra which he called \"double algebra\". The first stage in the development of algebra is arithmetic, where only natural numbers and symbols of operations such as +, \u00d7, etc. are used. The next stage is universal arithmetic, where letters appear instead of numbers, so as to denote numbers universally, and the processes are conducted without knowing the values of the symbols. Let a and b denote any natural numbers. An expression such as a \u2212 b may still be impossible, so in universal arithmetic there is always a proviso, provided the operation is possible. The third stage is single algebra, where the symbol may denote a quantity forwards or a quantity backwards, and is adequately represented by segments on a straight line passing through an origin. Negative quantities are then no longer impossible; they are represented by the backward segment. But an impossibility still remains in the latter part of such an expression as a + b\u221a\u22121 which arises in the solution of the quadratic equation. The fourth stage is double algebra. The algebraic symbol denotes in general a segment of a line in a given plane. It is a double symbol because it involves two specifications, namely, length, and direction; and \u221a\u22121 is interpreted as denoting a quadrant. The expression a + b\u221a\u22121 then represents a line in the plane having an abscissa a and an ordinate b. Argand and Warren carried double algebra so far but they were unable to interpret on this theory such an expression as ea\u221a\u22121. De Morgan attempted it by reducing such an expression to the form b + q\u221a\u22121, and he considered that he had shown that it could be always so reduced. The remarkable fact is that this double algebra satisfies all the fundamental laws above enumerated, and as every apparently impossible combination of symbols has been interpreted it looks like the complete form of algebra. In chapter\u00a06 he introduced hyperbolic functions and discussed the connection of common and hyperbolic trigonometry./nIf the above theory is true, the next stage of development ought to be triple algebra and if a + b\u221a\u22121 truly represents a line in a given plane, it ought to be possible to find a third term which added to the above would represent a line in space. Argand and some others guessed that it was a + b\u221a\u22121 + c\u221a\u22121\u221a\u22121 although this contradicts the truth established by Euler that \u221a\u22121\u221a\u22121 = e\u2212\u03c0/2. De Morgan and many others worked hard at the problem, but nothing came of it until the problem was taken up by Hamilton. We now see the reason clearly: The symbol of double algebra denotes not a length and a direction; but a multiplier and an angle. In it the angles are confined to one plane. Hence the next stage will be a quadruple algebra, when the axis of the plane is made variable. And this gives the answer to the first question; double algebra is nothing but analytical plane trigonometry, and this is why it has been found to be the natural analysis for alternating currents. But De Morgan never got this far. He died with the belief that \"double algebra must remain as the full development of the conceptions of arithmetic, so far as those symbols are concerned which arithmetic immediately suggests\"./nIn Book II, Chapter II, following the above quoted passage about the theory of symbolic algebra, De Morgan proceeds to give an inventory of the fundamental symbols of algebra, and also an inventory of the laws of algebra. The symbols are \n\n\n\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 0}\n\n, \n\n\n\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1}\n\n, \n\n\n\n+\n\n\n{\\displaystyle +}\n\n, \n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n{\\displaystyle -}\n\n, \n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\times }\n\n, \n\n\n\n\u00f7\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\div }\n\n, \n\n\n\n(\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ()}\n\n(), and letters; these only, all others are derived. As De Morgan explains, the last of these symbols represents writing a latter expression in superscript over and after a former. His inventory of the fundamental laws is expressed under fourteen heads, but some of them are merely definitions. The preceding list of symbols is the matter under the first of these heads. The laws proper may be reduced to the following, which, as he admits, are not all independent of one another, \"but the unsymmetrical character of the exponential operation, and the want of the connecting process of \n\n\n\n+\n\n\n{\\displaystyle +}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\times }\n\n ... renders it necessary to state them separately\":/nDe Morgan professes to give a complete inventory of the laws which the symbols of algebra must obey, for he says, \"Any system of symbols which obeys these rules and no others\u2014except they be formed by combination of these rules\u2014and which uses the preceding symbols and no others\u2014except they be new symbols invented in abbreviation of combinations of these symbols\u2014is symbolic algebra.\" From his point of view, none of the above principles are rules; they are formal laws, that is, arbitrarily chosen relations to which the algebraic symbols must be subject. He does not mention the law, which had already been pointed out by Gregory, namely, \n\n\n\n(\na\n+\nb\n)\n+\nc\n=\na\n+\n(\nb\n+\nc\n)\n,\n(\na\nb\n)\nc\n=\na\n(\nb\nc\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (a+b)+c=a+(b+c),(ab)c=a(bc)}\n\n and to which was afterwards given the name Law of association. If the commutative law fails, the associative may hold good; but not vice versa. It is an unfortunate thing for the symbolist or formalist that in universal arithmetic \n\n\n\n\nm\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m^{n}}\n\n is not equal to \n\n\n\n\nn\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n^{m}}\n\n; for then the commutative law would have full scope. Why does he not give it full scope? Because the foundations of algebra are, after all, real not formal, material not symbolic. To the formalists the index operations are exceedingly refractory, in consequence of which some take no account of them, but relegate them to applied mathematics.[citation needed] To give an inventory of the laws which the symbols of algebra must obey is an impossible task, and reminds one not a little of the task of those philosophers who attempt to give an inventory of the a priori knowledge of the mind.[citation needed][original research?]/nWhen the study of mathematics revived at the University of Cambridge, so did the study of logic. The moving spirit was Whewell, the Master of Trinity College, whose principal writings were a History of the Inductive Sciences, and Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences. Doubtless De Morgan was influenced in his logical investigations by Whewell; but other influential contemporaries were Sir William Rowan Hamilton at Dublin, and George Boole at Cork. De Morgan's work, Formal Logic, published in 1847, is principally remarkable for his development of the numerically definite syllogism. The followers of Aristotle say that from two particular propositions such as Some M's are A's, and Some M's are B's nothing follows of necessity about the relation of the A's and B's. But they go further and say in order that any relation about the A's and B's may follow of necessity, the middle term must be taken universally in one of the premises. De Morgan pointed out that from Most M's are A's and Most M's are B's it follows of necessity that some A's are B's and he formulated the numerically definite syllogism which puts this principle in exact quantitative form. Suppose that the number of the M's is \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n, of the M's that are A's is \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n, and of the M's that are B's is \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n; then there are at least \n\n\n\n(\na\n+\nb\n\u2212\nm\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (a+b-m)}\n\n A's that are B's. Suppose that the number of souls on board a steamer was 1000, that 500 were in the saloon, and 700 were lost. It follows of necessity, that at least 700 + 500 \u2013 1000, that is, 200, saloon passengers were lost. This single principle suffices to prove the validity of all the Aristotelian moods. It is therefore a fundamental principle in necessary reasoning./nHere then De Morgan had made a great advance by introducing quantification of the terms. At that time Sir William Hamilton was teaching in Edinburgh a doctrine of the quantification of the predicate, and a correspondence sprang up. However, De Morgan soon perceived that Hamilton's quantification was of a different character; that it meant for example, substituting the two forms The whole of A is the whole of B, and The whole of A is a part of B for the Aristotelian form All A's are B's. Hamilton thought that he had placed the keystone in the Aristotelian arch, as he phrased it. Although it must have been a curious arch which could stand 2000 years without a keystone. As a consequence he had no room for De Morgan's innovations. He accused De Morgan of plagiarism, and the controversy raged for years in the columns of the Athen\u00e6um, and in the publications of the two writers./nThe memoirs on logic which De Morgan contributed to the Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society subsequent to the publication of his book Formal Logic are by far the most important contributions which he made to the science, especially his fourth memoir, in which he begins work in the broad field of the \"logic of relatives\"./nIn the introduction to the Budget of Paradoxes De Morgan explains what he means by the word:/nA great many individuals, ever since the rise of the mathematical method, have, each for himself, attacked its direct and indirect consequences. I shall call each of these persons a paradoxer, and his system a paradox. I use the word in the old sense: a paradox is something which is apart from general opinion, either in subject matter, method, or conclusion. Many of the things brought forward would now be called crotchets, which is the nearest word we have to old paradox. But there is this difference, that by calling a thing a crotchet we mean to speak lightly of it; which was not the necessary sense of paradox. Thus in the 16th century many spoke of the earth's motion as the paradox of Copernicus and held the ingenuity of that theory in very high esteem, and some I think who even inclined towards it. In the seventeenth century the deprivation of meaning took place, in England at least./nHow can the sound paradoxer be distinguished from the false paradoxer? De Morgan supplies the following test:/nThe manner in which a paradoxer will show himself, as to sense or nonsense, will not depend upon what he maintains, but upon whether he has or has not made a sufficient knowledge of what has been done by others, especially as to the mode of doing it, a preliminary to inventing knowledge for himself... New knowledge, when to any purpose, must come by contemplation of old knowledge, in every matter which concerns thought; mechanical contrivance sometimes, not very often, escapes this rule. All the men who are now called discoverers, in every matter ruled by thought, have been men versed in the minds of their predecessors and learned in what had been before them. There is not one exception./nThe Budget consists of a review of a large collection of paradoxical books which De Morgan had accumulated in his own library, partly by purchase at bookstands, partly from books sent to him for review, partly from books sent to him by the authors. He gives the following classification: squarers of the circle, trisectors of the angle, duplicators of the cube, constructors of perpetual motion, subverters of gravitation, stagnators of the earth, builders of the universe. You will still find specimens of all these classes in the New World and in the new century. De Morgan gives his personal knowledge of paradoxers./nI suspect that I know more of the English class than any man in Britain. I never kept any reckoning: but I know that one year with another?\u00a0 and less of late years than in earlier time?\u00a0\u2013 I have talked to more than five in each year, giving more than a hundred and fifty specimens. Of this I am sure, that it is my own fault if they have not been a thousand. Nobody knows how they swarm, except those to whom they naturally resort. They are in all ranks and occupations, of all ages and characters. They are very earnest people, and their purpose is bona fide, the dissemination of their paradoxes. A great many\u00a0\u2013 the mass, indeed\u00a0\u2013 are illiterate, and a great many waste their means, and are in or approaching penury. These discoverers despise one another./nA paradoxer to whom De Morgan paid the compliment which Achilles paid Hector \u2013 to drag him round the walls again and again \u2013 was James Smith, a successful merchant of Liverpool. He found \n\n\n\n\u03c0\n=\n3\n\n\n\n1\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\pi =3{\\tfrac {1}{8}}}\n\n. His mode of reasoning was a curious caricature of the reductio ad absurdum of Euclid. He said let \n\n\n\n\u03c0\n=\n3\n\n\n\n1\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\pi =3{\\tfrac {1}{8}}}\n\n, and then showed that on that supposition, every other value of \n\n\n\n\u03c0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\pi }\n\n must be absurd. Consequently, \n\n\n\n\u03c0\n=\n3\n\n\n\n1\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\pi =3{\\tfrac {1}{8}}}\n\n is the true value. The following is a specimen of De Morgan's dragging round the walls of Troy:/nMr. Smith continues to write me long letters, to which he hints that I am to answer. In his last of 31 closely written sides of note paper, he informs me, with reference to my obstinate silence, that though I think myself and am thought by others to be a mathematical Goliath, I have resolved to play the mathematical snail, and keep within my shell. A mathematical snail! This cannot be the thing so called which regulates the striking of a clock; for it would mean that I am to make Mr. Smith sound the true time of day, which I would by no means undertake upon a clock that gains 19 seconds odd in every hour by false quadrative value of \n\n\n\n\u03c0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\pi }\n\n. But he ventures to tell me that pebbles from the sling of simple truth and common sense will ultimately crack my shell, and put me hors de combat. The confusion of images is amusing: Goliath turning himself into a snail to avoid \n\n\n\n\u03c0\n=\n3\n\n\n\n1\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\pi =3{\\tfrac {1}{8}}}\n\n and James Smith, Esq., of the Mersey Dock Board: and put hors de combat by pebbles from a sling. If Goliath had crept into a snail shell, David would have cracked the Philistine with his foot. There is something like modesty in the implication that the crack-shell pebble has not yet taken effect; it might have been thought that the slinger would by this time have been singing \u2013 And thrice [and one-eighth] I routed all my foes, And thrice [and one-eighth] I slew the slain./nIn the region of pure mathematics, De Morgan could detect easily the false from the true paradox; but he was not so proficient in the field of physics. His father-in-law was a paradoxer, and his wife a paradoxer; and in the opinion of the physical philosophers De Morgan himself scarcely escaped. His wife wrote a book describing the phenomena of spiritualism, table-rapping, table-turning, etc.; and De Morgan wrote a preface in which he said that he knew some of the asserted facts, believed others on testimony, but did not pretend to know whether they were caused by spirits, or had some unknown and unimagined origin. From this alternative he left out ordinary material causes. Faraday delivered a lecture on Spiritualism, in which he laid it down that in the investigation we ought to set out with the idea of what is physically possible, or impossible; De Morgan did not believe this./nDe Morgan developed the calculus of relations in his Syllabus of a Proposed System of Logic (1966: 208\u201346), first published in 1860. De Morgan was able to show that reasoning with syllogisms could be replaced with composition of relations.[12] The calculus was described as the logic of relatives by Charles Sanders Peirce, who admired De Morgan and met him shortly before his death. The calculus was further extended in the third volume of Ernst Schr\u00f6der's Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der Logik. Binary relations, especially order theory, proved critical to the Principia Mathematica of Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead. In turn, this calculus became the subject of much further work, starting in 1940, by Alfred Tarski and his colleagues and students at the University of California./nDe Morgan later in his life became interested in the phenomena of spiritualism. In 1849, he had investigated clairvoyance and was impressed by the subject. He later carried out paranormal investigations in his own home with the American medium Maria Hayden. The result of those investigations was later published by his wife Sophia. De Morgan believed that his career as a scientist might have been affected if he had revealed his interest in the study of spiritualism, so he helped to publish the book anonymously.[13] The book was published in 1863, titled From Matter to Spirit: The Result of Ten Years Experience in Spirit Manifestations./nAccording to historian Janet Oppenheim, De Morgan's wife Sophia was a convinced spiritualist but De Morgan shared a third way position on spiritualist phenomena, which Oppenheim defined as a \"wait-and-see position\"; he was neither a believer nor a sceptic. Instead, his viewpoint was that the methodology of the physical sciences does not automatically exclude psychic phenomena, and that such phenomena may be explainable in time by the possible existence of natural forces which physicists had not yet identified.[14]/nIn the preface of From Matter to Spirit (1863), De Morgan stated:/nThinking it very likely that the universe may contain a few agencies\u00a0\u2013 say half a million\u00a0\u2013 about which no man knows anything, I can not but suspect that a small proportion of these agencies\u00a0\u2013 say five thousand\u00a0\u2013 may be severally competent to the production of all the [spiritualist] phenomena, or may be quite up to the task among them. The physical explanations which I have seen are easy, but miserably insufficient: the spiritualist hypothesis is sufficient, but ponderously difficult. Time and thought will decide, the second asking the first for more results of trial./nPsychical researcher John Beloff wrote that De Morgan was the first notable scientist in Britain to take an interest in the study of spiritualism and his studies had influenced the decision of William Crookes to also study spiritualism. Beloff also claims that De Morgan was an atheist and so he was debarred from a position at Oxford or Cambridge.[15]/nBeyond his great mathematical legacy, the headquarters of the London Mathematical Society is called De Morgan House and the student society of the Mathematics Department of University College London is called the Augustus De Morgan Society./nThe lunar crater De Morgan is named after him.", "34383018": "Hugh William Segar (31 January 1868 \u2013 18 September 1954) was a New Zealand mathematician and university professor.

His book Bollinger on Bollinger Bands (2001), has been translated into eleven languages.[note 1] Since 1987, he has published the Capital Growth Letter, a newsletter which provides technical analysis of the financial markets./nBollinger Bands are intervals drawn on a price chart that define high and low on a relative basis. Bollinger started developing Bollinger Bands in the early 1980s. He was trading options at the time and much of his analytics involved volatility. At the time fixed width trading bands were in use. Mr. Bollinger's contribution was to use volatility standard deviation to make trading bands adaptive./nWhen Bollinger first introduced the concept to the public on Financial News Network, they had no name. During the program, the interviewer pointed to the bands and inquired as to what they were; Bollinger replied \"Let's call them Bollinger Bands.\"[1]/n\"John Bollinger, CMT, CFA, has always concentrated on the overlap between technical and fundamental analysis, rather than focus on the differences. To bridge the gap between fundamental and technical analysis, Bollinger advocates an approach he calls 'Rational Analysis'\".[2] Bollinger first coined the term \"Rational Analysis\" in the late 1980s. He then defined it as the \"juncture of the overlap between technical and fundamental analysis\" and created a visual representation./nAt the 2004 AIMR Conference, in his presentation titled Combining Technical and Fundamental Analysis, he took his concept one step further. Because the financial analysis community sub-categorizes itself in ever finer specialty groups, his updated definition of Rational Analysis was stated as \"the union of the sets of technical, fundamental, quantitative and behavioral analysis\".[citation needed]/nThe analogy Bollinger uses for Rational Analysis is having multiple tool kits each with different tools. To get the job done the rational approach is to take the tool that does the job best, regardless of which tool kit it comes from. The same is true for financial analysis. Depending on the analytical scenario, sometimes technical analysis tools provide the best insights. Sometimes fundamental analysis, behavioral analysis or quantitative analysis; and most often a combination of all four is the most rigorous and productive./nAfter purchasing his first microcomputer in 1977, Bollinger became involved in the seminal stages of computer-driven technical analysis. Computer technology allowed Bollinger to develop Group Power, an industry group ranking system that shows developing trends in industry groups and sectors. Over the years the service evolved, the underlying structure becoming a proprietary equal-weighted industry group structure and delivery via the Internet allowed ever more complex analytics./nIn 1996 Bollinger recognized the potential of the Internet for financial analysis and began the programming for equitytrader.com.

He served several terms as head of government and head of state and had a leading role in introducing the 1937 Constitution of Ireland.[3][4]/nDe Valera was a commandant of Irish Volunteers at Boland's Mill during the 1916 Easter Rising. He was arrested and sentenced to death, but released for a variety of reasons, including his American citizenship and the public response to the British execution of Rising leaders. He returned to Ireland after being jailed in England and became one of the leading political figures of the War of Independence. After the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, de Valera served as the political leader of Anti-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in until 1926, when he, along with many supporters, left the party to set up Fianna F\u00e1il, a new political party which abandoned the policy of abstentionism from D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann./nFrom there, de Valera went on to be at the forefront of Irish politics until the turn of the 1960s. He took over as president of the Executive Council from W. T. Cosgrave and later became Taoiseach, with the adoption of the Constitution of Ireland in 1937. He served as Taoiseach on three different occasions: from 1937 to 1948, from 1951 to 1954, and finally from 1957 to 1959. He remains the longest serving Taoiseach by total days served in the post. He resigned in 1959 upon his election as president of Ireland. By then, he had been Leader of Fianna F\u00e1il for 33 years and he, along with older founding members, began to take a less prominent role relative to newer ministers such as Jack Lynch, Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney. De Valera served as President of Ireland from 1959 to 1973, two full terms in office./nDe Valera's political beliefs evolved from militant Irish republicanism to strong social, cultural and fiscal conservatism.[5] He has been characterised as having a stern and unbending, and also devious demeanour. His roles in the Civil War have also been interpreted as making him a divisive figure in Irish history. Biographer Tim Pat Coogan sees his time in power as being characterised by economic and cultural stagnation, while Diarmaid Ferriter argues that the stereotype of de Valera as an austere, cold, and even backward figure was largely manufactured in the 1960s and is misguided.[5]/n\u00c9amon de Valera was born on 14 October 1882 in New York City, the son of Catherine Coll, who was originally from Bruree, County Limerick,[6] and Juan Vivion de Valera, described on the birth certificate as a Spanish artist born in 1853. Some researchers have placed his father's place of birth in Cuba,[7] while others have suggested other locations; according to Antonio Rivero Taravillo, he was born in Seville,[8] while Ronan Fanning has him born in the Basque Country.[9]/nHe was born at the Nursery and Child's Hospital,[10] Lexington Avenue, a home for destitute orphans and abandoned children.[11] His parents were reportedly married on 18 September 1881 at St Patrick's Church in Jersey City, New Jersey, but archivists have not located any marriage certificate or any birth, baptismal, or death certificate information for anyone called Juan Vivion de Valera (nor for \"de Valeros\", an alternative spelling). On de Valera's original birth certificate, his name is given as George de Valero and his father is listed as Vivion de Valero. Although he was known as Edward de Valera before 1901, a fresh birth certificate was issued in 1910, in which his first name was officially changed to Edward and his father's surname given as \"de Valera\".[12][13] As a child, he was known as \"Eddie\" or \"Eddy\".[14]/nAccording to Coll, Juan Vivion died in 1885 leaving Coll and her child in poor circumstances.[15] \u00c9amon was taken to Ireland by his uncle Ned at the age of two. When his mother remarried in the mid-1880s, he was not brought back to live with her, but was reared by his grandmother, Elizabeth Coll, her son Patrick and her daughter Hannie, in Bruree, County Limerick. He was educated locally at Bruree National School, County Limerick and C.B.S. Charleville, County Cork. Aged sixteen, he won a scholarship. He was not successful in enrolling at two colleges in Limerick, but was accepted at Blackrock College, Dublin, at the instigation of his local curate.[16]:\u200a19\u201320/nHe played rugby at Blackrock and Rockwell College, then for Munster around 1905. He remained a lifelong devotee of rugby, attending international matches even towards the end of his life when he was nearly blind.[17]/nAt the end of his first year at Blackrock College he was student of the year. He also won further scholarships and exhibitions and in 1903 was appointed teacher of mathematics at Rockwell College, County Tipperary.[18] It was here that de Valera was first given the nickname \"Dev\" by a teaching colleague, Tom O'Donnell.[19]:\u200a73\u200a In 1904, he graduated in mathematics from the Royal University of Ireland. He then studied for a year at Trinity College Dublin but, owing to the necessity of earning a living, did not proceed further and returned to teaching, this time at Belvedere College.[19]:\u200a87\u201390\u200a In 1906, he secured a post as a teacher of mathematics at Carysfort Teachers' Training College for women in Blackrock, Dublin. His applications for professorships in colleges of the National University of Ireland were unsuccessful, but he obtained a part-time appointment at St Patrick's College, Maynooth[20] and also taught mathematics at various Dublin schools, including Castleknock College (1910\u20131911; under the name Edward de Valera) and Belvedere College.[21]/nThere were occasions when de Valera seriously contemplated the religious life like his half-brother, Fr. Thomas Wheelwright, but ultimately he did not pursue this vocation. As late as 1906, when he was 24 years old, he approached the President of Clonliffe Seminary in Dublin for advice on his vocation.[22] De Valera was throughout his life portrayed as a deeply religious man, and in death asked to be buried in a religious habit. His biographer, Tim Pat Coogan, speculated that questions surrounding de Valera's legitimacy may have been a deciding factor in his not entering religious life. Being illegitimate would have ordinarily been a bar to receiving priestly orders as a secular priest, but not to becoming a priest or religious in some religious orders.[23]/nAs a young Gaeilgeoir (Irish speaker), de Valera became an activist for the Irish language. In 1908, he joined the \u00c1rdchraobh of Conradh na Gaeilge (the Gaelic League), where he met Sin\u00e9ad Flanagan, a teacher by profession and four years his senior. They were married on 8 January 1910 at St Paul's Church, Arran Quay, Dublin./nThe couple had five sons: Vivion (1910\u20131982), \u00c9amon (1913\u20131986), Brian (1915\u20131936), R\u00faaidhr\u00ed (1916\u20131978), and Terence (Terry; 1922\u20132007); and two daughters: M\u00e1ir\u00edn (1912\u20131984) and Emer (1918\u20132012). Brian de Valera predeceased his parents./nWhile he was already involved in the Gaelic revival, de Valera's involvement in the political revolution began on 25 November 1913, when he joined the Irish Volunteers. The organisation was formed to oppose the Ulster Volunteers and ensure the enactment of the Irish Parliamentary Party's Third Home Rule Act won by its leader John Redmond. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, de Valera rose through the ranks and it was not long before he was elected captain of the Donnybrook branch. Preparations were pushed ahead for an armed revolt, and he was made commandant of the Third Battalion and adjutant of the Dublin Brigade. He took part in the Howth gun-running.[24] He was sworn by Thomas MacDonagh into the oath-bound Irish Republican Brotherhood, which secretly controlled the central executive of the Volunteers. He opposed secret societies, but this was the only way he could be guaranteed full information on plans for the Rising.[16]:\u200a32/nOn 24 April 1916, the Easter Rising began. Forces commanded by de Valera occupied Boland's Mill[25] on Grand Canal Street in Dublin. His chief task was to cover the southeastern approaches to the city. After a week of fighting, the order came from P\u00e1draig Pearse to surrender. De Valera was court-martialled, convicted, and sentenced to death, but the sentence was immediately commuted to penal servitude for life./nDe Valera was among the few republican leaders the British did not execute.[25] It has been argued that his life was saved by four facts. First, he was one of the last to surrender and he was held in a different prison from other leaders, thus his execution was delayed by practicalities. Second, the US Consulate in Dublin made representations before his trial (i.e., was he actually a United States citizen and if so, how would the United States react to the execution of one of its citizens?) while the full legal situation was clarified.[citation needed] The UK was trying to bring the US into the war in Europe at the time, and the Irish American vote was important in US politics.[25] Third, when Lt-Gen Sir John Maxwell reviewed his case he said, \"Who is he? I haven't heard of him before. I wonder would he be likely to make trouble in the future?\" On being told that de Valera was unimportant, he commuted the court-martial's death sentence to life imprisonment.[26]:\u200a93\u200a De Valera had no Fenian family or personal background and his MI5 file in 1916 was very slim, detailing only his open membership in the Irish Volunteers.[26]:\u200a92\u200a Fourth, by the time de Valera was court-martialled on 8 May, political pressure was being brought to bear on Maxwell to halt the executions; Maxwell had already told British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith that only two more were to be executed, Se\u00e1n Mac Diarmada and James Connolly, although they were court-martialled the day after de Valera. His late trial, representations made by the American Consulate, his lack of Fenian background and political pressure all combined to save his life, though had he been tried a week earlier he would probably have been shot.[26]:\u200a91\u201394/nDe Valera's supporters and detractors argue about his bravery during the Easter Rising. His supporters claim he showed leadership skills and a capacity for meticulous planning. His detractors claim he suffered a nervous breakdown during the Rising. According to accounts from 1916, de Valera was seen running about, giving conflicting orders, refusing to sleep and on one occasion, having forgotten the password, almost getting himself shot in the dark by his own men. According to one account, de Valera, on being forced to sleep by one subordinate who promised to sit beside him and wake him if he was needed, suddenly woke up, his eyes \"wild\", screaming, \"Set fire to the railway! Set fire to the railway!\" Later in the Ballykinlar internment Camp, one de Valera loyalist approached another internee, a medical doctor, recounted the story, and asked for a medical opinion as to de Valera's condition. He also threatened to sue the doctor, future Fine Gael TD and Minister, Dr. Tom O'Higgins, if he ever repeated the story.[27] The British reportedly, however, considered de Valera's forces the best-trained and best-led among the rebels.[25] De Valera's latest biographer, Anthony J. Jordan, writes of this controversy, \"Whatever happened in Boland's Mills, or any other garrison, does not negate or undermine in any way the extraordinary heroism of \"Dev\" and his comrades\".[16]:\u200a37/nAfter imprisonment in Dartmoor, Maidstone and Lewes prisons, de Valera and his comrades were released under an amnesty in June 1917. On 10 July 1917, he was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for East Clare (the constituency which he represented until 1959) in a by-election caused by the death of the previous incumbent Willie Redmond, brother of the Irish Party leader John Redmond, who had died fighting in World War I. In the 1918 general election he was elected both for that seat and Mayo East.[28] As an abstentionist de Valera would not have gone to Westminster, but was not able to do so regardless because in early 1918 he was again arrested.[25]/nBecause most other Irish rebellion leaders were dead, in 1917 de Valera had been elected President of Sinn F\u00e9in,[25] the party which had been blamed incorrectly for provoking the Easter Rising.[citation needed] This party became the political vehicle through which the survivors of the Easter Rising channelled their republican ethos and objectives.[29] The previous President of Sinn F\u00e9in, Arthur Griffith, had championed an Anglo-Irish dual-monarchy based on the Austro-Hungarian model, with independent legislatures for both Ireland and Britain./nSinn F\u00e9in won a huge majority in the 1918 general election, largely thanks to the British executions of the 1916 leaders, the threat of conscription with the Conscription Crisis of 1918 and the first-past-the-post ballot. They won 73 out of 105 Irish seats, with about 47% of votes cast. 25 seats were uncontested. On 21 January 1919, 27 Sinn F\u00e9in MPs (the rest were imprisoned or impaired), calling themselves Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la (TDs), assembled in the Mansion House in Dublin and formed an Irish parliament, known as D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (translatable into English as the Assembly of Ireland). The Ministry of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann was formed, under the leadership of the Pr\u00edomh Aire (also called President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann) Cathal Brugha. De Valera had been re-arrested in May 1918 and imprisoned and so could not attend the January session of the D\u00e1il. He escaped from Lincoln Gaol, England in February 1919. As a result, he replaced Brugha as Pr\u00edomh Aire in the April session of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.[citation needed]/nIn the hope of securing international recognition, Se\u00e1n T. O'Kelly was sent as envoy to Paris to present the Irish case to the Peace Conference convened by the great powers at the end of World War I. When it became clear by May 1919 that this mission could not succeed, de Valera decided to visit the United States. The mission had three objectives: to ask for official recognition of the Irish Republic, to float a loan to finance the work of the Government (and by extension, the Irish Republican Army), and to secure the support of the American people for the republic. His visit lasted from June 1919 to December 1920 and had mixed success, including a visit to Fenway Park in Boston in front of 50,000 supporters.[30] One negative outcome was the splitting of the Irish-American organisations into pro- and anti-de Valera factions.[16]:\u200a63\u201370\u200a He met the young Harvard-educated leader from Puerto Rico, Pedro Albizu Campos, and forged a lasting and useful alliance with him.[31] It was during this American tour that he recruited his long-serving personal secretary, Kathleen O'Connell, an Irish emigrant who would return to Ireland with him.[32] In October 1919, he visited the University of Notre Dame campus in Indiana, where he planted a tree and also laid a wreath by the statue of William Corby. He toured the university archives and spoke in Washington Hall about the cause of Ireland in front of twelve hundred students.[33][34]/nDe Valera managed to raise $5,500,000 from American supporters, an amount that far exceeded the hopes of the D\u00e1il.[35] Of this, $500,000 was devoted to the American presidential campaign in 1920, helping him gain wider public support there.[36] In 1921, it was said that $1,466,000 had already been spent, and it is unclear when the net balance arrived in Ireland.[37] Recognition was not forthcoming in the international sphere. He also had difficulties with various Irish-American leaders, such as John Devoy and Judge Daniel F. Cohalan, who resented the dominant position he established, preferring to retain their control over Irish affairs in the United States./nWhile American recognition for the Republic had been his priority, in February 1921, De Valera redirected Patrick McCartan from Washington to Moscow. McCartan was told by Maxim Litvinov, that the opportunity of recognition and assistance had passed. The Soviet priority was a trade agreement with Britain (signed in March). In June the British government (with a view to both domestic and American opinion) published the proposed treaty between the D\u00e1il government and the Soviets, and related correspondence.[38]/nMeanwhile, in Ireland, the conflict between the British authorities and the D\u00e1il (which the British declared illegal in September 1919), escalated into the Irish War of Independence. De Valera left day-to-day government, during his eighteen-month absence in the United States, to Michael Collins, his 29-year-old Minister for Finance. De Valera and Collins would later become opponents during the Irish Civil War.[39]/nIn January 1921, in his first appearance in the D\u00e1il, after his return to a country gripped by the War of Independence, de Valera introduced a motion calling on the IRA to desist from ambushes and other tactics that were allowing the British to successfully portray it as a terrorist group,[40] and to take on the British forces with conventional military methods. This they strongly opposed, and de Valera relented, issuing a statement expressing support for the IRA, and claimed it was fully under the control of the D\u00e1il. He then, along with Cathal Brugha and Austin Stack, brought pressure to bear on Michael Collins to undertake a journey to the United States himself, on the pretext that only he could take up where de Valera had left off. Collins successfully resisted this move and stayed in Ireland. In the elections of May 1921, all candidates in Southern Ireland were returned unopposed, and Sinn F\u00e9in secured some seats in Northern Ireland./nFollowing the Truce of July 1921 that ended the war, de Valera went to see Prime Minister David Lloyd George in London on 14 July. No agreement was reached, and by then the Parliament of Northern Ireland had already met. It became clear that neither a republic, nor independence for all 32 counties, was going to be offered; Lloyd George told de Valera he could \"put a soldier in Ireland for every man, woman and child in it\" if the IRA did not immediately agree to stop fighting.[41] In August 1921, de Valera secured D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann approval to change the 1919 D\u00e1il Constitution to upgrade his office from prime minister or chairman of the cabinet to a full President of the Republic. Declaring himself now the Irish equivalent of King George V, he argued that as Irish head of state, in the absence of the British head of state from the negotiations, he too should not attend the peace conference called the Treaty Negotiations (October\u2013December 1921) at which British and Irish government leaders agreed to the effective independence of twenty-six of Ireland's thirty-two counties as the Irish Free State, with Northern Ireland choosing to remain under British sovereignty. It is generally agreed by historians that whatever his motives, it was a mistake for de Valera not to have travelled to London.[16]:\u200a91/nHaving effected these changes, a boundary commission came into place to redraw the Irish border. Nationalists expected its report to recommend that largely nationalist areas become part of the Free State, and many hoped this would make Northern Ireland so small it would not be economically viable. A Council of Ireland was also provided in the Treaty as a model for an eventual all-Irish parliament. Hence neither the pro- nor anti-Treaty sides made many complaints about partition in the Treaty Debates./nThe Republic's delegates to the Treaty Negotiations were accredited by de Valera and his cabinet as plenipotentiaries (that is, negotiators with the legal authority to sign a treaty without reference back to the cabinet), but were given secret cabinet instructions by de Valera that required them to return to Dublin before signing the Treaty.[42] The Treaty proved controversial in Ireland insofar as it replaced the Republic by a dominion of the British Commonwealth with the King represented by a Governor-General of the Irish Free State. The Irish delegates Arthur Griffith, Robert Barton and Michael Collins supported by Erskine Childers as Secretary-General set up their delegation headquarters at 22 Hans Place in Knightsbridge. It was there, at 11.15\u00a0am on 5 December 1921, that the decision was made to recommend the Treaty to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. The Treaty was finally signed by the delegates after further negotiations which closed at 02:20 on 6 December 1921.[citation needed]/nDe Valera baulked at the agreement. His opponents claimed that he had refused to join the negotiations because he knew what the outcome would be and did not wish to receive the blame. De Valera claimed that he had not gone to the treaty negotiations because he would be better able to control the extremists at home, and that his absence would allow leverage for the plenipotentiaries to refer back to him and not be pressured into any agreements. Because of the secret instructions given to the plenipotentiaries, he reacted to news of the signing of the Treaty not with anger at its contents (which he refused even to read when offered a newspaper report of its contents), but with anger over the fact that they had not consulted him, their president, before signing. His ideal drafts, presented to a secret session of the D\u00e1il during the Treaty Debates and publicised in January 1922, were ingenious compromises[original research?] but they included dominion status, the Treaty Ports, the fact of partition subject to veto by the parliament in Belfast, and some continuing status for the King as head of the Commonwealth. Ireland's share of the imperial debt was to be paid.[43][failed verification]/nAfter the Treaty was narrowly ratified by 64 to 57, de Valera and a large minority of Sinn F\u00e9in TDs left D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. He then resigned and Arthur Griffith was elected President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann in his place, though respectfully still calling him 'The President'. On a speaking tour of the more republican province of Munster, starting on 17 March 1922, de Valera made controversial speeches at Carrick on Suir, Lismore, Dungarvan and Waterford, saying that: \"If the Treaty were accepted, [by the electorate] the fight for freedom would still go on, and the Irish people, instead of fighting foreign soldiers, will have to fight the Irish soldiers of an Irish government set up by Irishmen.\" At Thurles, several days later, he repeated this imagery and added that the IRA: \"..would have to wade through the blood of the soldiers of the Irish Government, and perhaps through that of some members of the Irish Government to get their freedom.\" In a letter to the Irish Independent on 23 March de Valera accepted the accuracy of their report of his comment about \"wading\" through blood, but deplored that the newspaper had published it.[44]/nDe Valera objected to the oath of allegiance to the King that the treaty required Irish parliamentarians to take. He also was concerned that Ireland could not have an independent foreign policy as part of the British Commonwealth when the British retained several naval ports (see Treaty Ports) around Ireland's coast. As a compromise, de Valera proposed \"external association\" with the British Empire, which would leave Ireland's foreign policy in her own hands and a republican constitution with no mention of the British monarch (he proposed this as early as April, well before the negotiations began, under the title \"Document No. 2\"). Michael Collins was prepared to accept this formula and the two wings (pro- and anti-Treaty) of Sinn F\u00e9in formed a pact to fight the 1922 Irish general election together and form a coalition government afterwards. Collins later called off the pact on the eve of the election. De Valera's opponents won the election and civil war broke out shortly afterwards in late June 1922.[45]/nRelations between the new Irish government, which was backed by most of the D\u00e1il and the electorate, and the anti-treatyites, under the nominal leadership of de Valera, now descended into the Irish Civil War (June 1922 to May 1923), in which the pro-treaty Free State forces defeated the anti-treaty IRA. Both sides had wanted to avoid civil war, but fighting broke out over the takeover of the Four Courts in Dublin by anti-treaty members of the IRA. These men were not loyal to de Valera and initially were not even supported by the executive of the anti-treaty IRA. However, Michael Collins was forced to act against them when Winston Churchill threatened to re-occupy the country with British troops unless action was taken. When fighting broke out in Dublin between the Four Courts garrison and the new Free State Army, republicans backed the IRA men in the Four Courts, and civil war broke out. De Valera, though he held no military position, backed the anti-treaty IRA, or irregulars, and said that he was re-enlisting in the IRA as an ordinary volunteer. On 8 September 1922, he met in secret with Richard Mulcahy in Dublin to try to halt the fighting. However, according to de Valera, they \"could not find a basis\" for agreement.[46]/nThough nominally head of the anti-treatyites, de Valera had little influence. He does not seem to have been involved in any fighting and had little or no influence with the revolutionary military leadership, headed by IRA Chief of Staff Liam Lynch. De Valera and the anti-treaty TDs formed a \"republican government\" on 25 October 1922 from anti-treaty TDs to \"be temporarily the Supreme Executive of the Republic and the State, until such time as the elected Parliament of the Republic can freely assemble, or the people being rid of external aggression are at liberty to decide freely how they are to be governed\". However, it had no real authority and was a pale shadow of the D\u00e1il government of 1919\u201321.[citation needed]/nIn March 1923, de Valera attended the meeting of the IRA Army Executive to decide on the future of the war. He was known to be in favour of a truce but he had no voting rights and it was narrowly decided to continue hostilities.[16]:\u200a131\u200a The leader of the Free State, W. T. Cosgrave, insisted that there could be no acceptance of a surrender without disarming.[47]/nOn 30 April 1923, the IRA's new Chief of Staff, Frank Aiken (Lynch had been killed), called a ceasefire. This was followed on 24 May by an order for volunteers to \"dump arms\". De Valera, who had wanted an end to the internecine fighting for some time, backed the ceasefire order with a message in which he called the anti-treaty fighters \"the Legion of the Rearguard\", saying that \"The Republic can no longer be successfully defended by your arms. Further sacrifice on your part would now be in vain and the continuance of the struggle in arms unwise in the national interest and prejudicial to the future of our cause. Military victory must be allowed to rest for the moment with those who have destroyed the republic. Other means must be sought to safeguard the nation's right.\"[48]/nAfter this point many of the republicans were arrested in Free State round-ups when they had come out of hiding and returned home. De Valera remained in hiding for several months after the ceasefire was declared; however, he emerged in August to stand for election in County Clare. Making a campaign appearance in Ennis on 15 August, de Valera was arrested on the platform and interned at Kilmainham jail. He was moved to Arbour Hill barracks briefly prior to his release on 16 July 1924.[49][50]/nAfter the IRA dumped their arms rather than surrender them or continue a now fruitless war, de Valera returned to political methods. In 1924, he was arrested in Newry for \"illegally entering Northern Ireland\" and held in solitary confinement for a month in Crumlin Road Gaol, Belfast.[51]/nDuring this time, de Valera came to believe that abstentionism was not a workable tactic in the long term. He now believed that a better course would be to try to gain power and turn the Free State from a constitutional monarchy into a republic. He tried to convince Sinn F\u00e9in to accept this new line. However, a vote to accept the Free State Constitution (contingent on the abolition of the Oath of Allegiance) narrowly failed. Soon afterwards, de Valera resigned from Sinn F\u00e9in and seriously considered leaving politics.[citation needed]/nHowever, one of his colleagues, Se\u00e1n Lemass, convinced de Valera to found a new republican party.[52] In March 1926, with Lemass, Constance Markievicz and others, de Valera formed a new party, Fianna F\u00e1il (The Warriors of Destiny), a party that was to dominate 20th-century Irish politics.[53] While Sinn F\u00e9in still held to an abstentionist line, Fianna F\u00e1il was dedicated to republicanising the Free State from within if it gained power./nHaving attracted most of Sinn F\u00e9in's branches due to Lemass' organisational skill,[52] the new party made swift electoral gains in the general election on 9 June 1927. In the process, it took much of Sinn F\u00e9in's previous support, winning 44 seats to Sinn F\u00e9in's five. It refused to take the Oath of Allegiance (portrayed by opponents as an 'Oath of Allegiance to the Crown' but actually an Oath of Allegiance to the Irish Free State with a secondary promise of fidelity to the King in his role in the Treaty settlement).[54]/nThe oath was largely the work of Collins and based on three sources: British oaths in the dominions, the oath of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and a draft oath prepared by de Valera in his proposed treaty alternative, \"Document No. 2\". De Valera began a legal case to challenge the requirement that members of his party take the Oath, but the assassination of the Vice-President of the Executive Council (deputy prime minister) Kevin O'Higgins on 10 July 1927 led the Executive Council under W. T. Cosgrave to introduce a Bill on 20 July[55] requiring all D\u00e1il candidates to promise on oath that if they were elected they would take the Oath of Allegiance. Forced into a corner, and faced with the option of staying outside politics forever or taking the oath and entering, de Valera and his TDs took the Oath of Allegiance on 12 August 1927, though de Valera himself described the Oath as \"an empty political formula\".[56]/nDe Valera never organised Fianna F\u00e1il in Northern Ireland and it was not until 7 December 2007 that Fianna F\u00e1il was registered there by the UK Electoral Commission.[57]/nIn the 1932 general election Fianna F\u00e1il secured 72 seats and became the largest party in the D\u00e1il, although without a majority. Some Fianna F\u00e1il members arrived at the first sitting of the new D\u00e1il carrying arms, amid fears that Cumann na nGaedheal would not voluntarily surrender power. However, the transition was peaceful.[58] De Valera was elected President of the Executive Council (Prime Minister) by the D\u00e1il by a vote of 81\u201368, with the support of the Labour Party and Independent politicians, and took office on 9 March.[59]/nHe at once initiated steps to fulfill his election promises to abolish the oath and withhold land annuities owed to the UK for loans provided under the Irish Land Acts and agreed as part of the 1921 Treaty. This launched the Anglo-Irish Trade War when the UK in retaliation imposed economic sanctions against Irish exports. De Valera responded in kind with levies on British imports. The ensuing \"Economic War\" lasted until 1938.[60][61]/nAfter De Valera had urged King George V to dismiss McNeill as Governor-General, the King suggested an alternative course of action: that McNeill, instead, carry on a while longer as viceroy and only then resign, which he did on 1 November 1932. Subsequently, a 1916 veteran, Domhnall Ua Buachalla, was appointed Governor-General. To strengthen his position against the opposition in the D\u00e1il and Seanad, de Valera directed the Governor-General to call a snap election in January 1933 and de Valera's party won 77 seats, giving Fianna F\u00e1il an overall majority. Under de Valera's leadership, Fianna F\u00e1il won further general elections in 1937, 1938, 1943, and 1944.[citation needed]/nDe Valera took charge of Ireland's foreign policy as well by also acting as Minister for External Affairs. In that capacity, he attended meetings of the League of Nations. He was president of the Council of the League on his first appearance at the league in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1932 and, in a speech that made a worldwide impression, appealed for genuine adherence by its members to the principles of the covenant of the league. In 1934, he supported the admission of the Soviet Union into the league. In September 1938, he was elected nineteenth president of the Assembly of the League,[62] a tribute to the international recognition he had won by his independent stance on world questions.[63]/nDe Valera's government followed the policy of unilaterally dismantling the treaty of 1921. In this way he would be pursuing republican policies and lessening the popularity of republican violence and the IRA. De Valera encouraged IRA members to join the Irish Defence Forces and the Garda\u00ed. He also refused to dismiss from office those Cumann na nGaedheal, Cosgrave supporters, who had previously opposed him during the Civil War. He did, however, dismiss Eoin O'Duffy from his position as Garda Commissioner after a year. Eoin O'Duffy was then invited to be head of the Army Comrades Association (ACA) formed to protect and promote the welfare of its members, previously led by J.F. O'Higgins, Kevin O'Higgins's brother. This organisation was an obstacle to de Valera's power as it supported Cumann na nGaedheal and provided stewards for their meetings. Cumann na nGaedheal meetings were frequently disrupted by Fianna F\u00e1il supporters following the publication of the article: No Free Speech for Traitors by Peadar O'Donnell, an IRA member.[citation needed]/nThe ACA changed its name to the National Guard under O'Duffy and adopted the uniform of black berets and blue shirts, using the straight-armed salute, and were nicknamed the Blueshirts. They were outwardly fascist and planned a march in August 1933 through Dublin to commemorate Michael Collins, Kevin O'Higgins, and Arthur Griffith. This march struck parallels with Mussolini's march on Rome (1922), in which he had created the image of having toppled the democratic government in Rome. De Valera revived a military tribunal, which had been set up by the previous administration, to deal with the matter. O'Duffy backed down when the National Guard was declared an illegal organisation and the march was banned. Within a few weeks, O'Duffy's followers merged with Cumann na nGaedhael and the Centre Party to form United Ireland, or Fine Gael, and O'Duffy became its leader. Smaller local marches were scheduled for the following weeks, under different names. Internal dissension set in when the party's TDs distanced themselves from O'Duffy's extreme views, and his movement fell asunder.[64]/nFianna F\u00e1il having won the 1937 election held the same day as the plebiscite that ratified the constitution, de Valera continued as President of the Executive Council until 29 December 1937, when the new constitution was enacted. On that date, de Valera's post automatically became that of Taoiseach which was a considerably more powerful office. Notably, he could advise the President to dismiss Ministers individually \u2013 advice that the President was bound to follow by convention. The old Executive Council had to be dissolved and reformed en bloc if its President wanted to remove a Minister. Additionally, he could request a parliamentary dissolution on his own authority. Previously, the right to seek a dissolution was vested with the Council as a whole.[citation needed]/nIn social policy, de Valera's first period as Taoiseach saw the introduction (in 1947) of means-tested allowances for people suffering from infectious diseases.[65]/nWith the new constitution in place, de Valera determined that the changed circumstances made swift resolution to Ireland's ongoing trade war with the UK more desirable for both sides\u2014as did the growing probability of the outbreak of war across Europe. In April 1938, de Valera and British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain signed the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement, lifting all duties imposed during the previous five years and ending British use of the Treaty Ports it had retained in accordance with the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The return of the ports was of particular significance, since it ensured Irish neutrality during the coming Second World War.[citation needed]/nDuring the 1930s, de Valera systematically stripped the Irish Free State constitution \u2013 a constitution originally drafted by a committee under the nominal chairmanship of his rival, Collins \u2013 of features tying Ireland to the United Kingdom, limiting its independence and the republican character of its state. De Valera was able to carry out this program of constitutional change by taking advantage of three earlier modifications of constitutional arrangements. First, though the 1922 constitution originally required a public plebiscite for any amendment enacted more than eight years after its passage, the Free State government under W. T. Cosgrave had amended that period to sixteen years. This meant that, until 1938, the Free State constitution could be amended by the simple passage of a Constitutional Amendment Act through the Oireachtas. Secondly, while the Governor-General of the Irish Free State could reserve or deny Royal Assent to any legislation, from 1927, the power to advise the Governor-General to do so no longer rested with the British government in London but with His Majesty's Government in the Irish Free State, which meant that, in practice, the Royal Assent was automatically granted to legislation; the government was hardly likely to advise the governor-general to block the enactment of one of its own bills. Thirdly, though in its original theory, the constitution had to be in keeping with the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Treaty as the fundamental law of the state, that requirement had been abrogated a short time before de Valera gained power.[citation needed]/nThe Oath of Allegiance was abolished, as were appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The opposition-controlled Senate, when it protested and slowed down these measures, was also abolished. In 1931, the British Parliament passed the Statute of Westminster, which established the legislative equal status of the self-governing Dominions of the then British Commonwealth, including the Irish Free State, to one another and the United Kingdom. Though a few constitutional links between the Dominions and the United Kingdom remained, this is often seen as the moment at which the Dominions became fully sovereign states.[citation needed]/nDe Valera, in his capacity as Prime Minister of His Majesty's Government in the Irish Free State, wrote in July 1936 to King Edward VIII in London indicating that he planned to introduce a new constitution, the central part of which was to be the creation of an office de Valera provisionally intended to call President of Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann (Irish: Uachtar\u00e1n Shaorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann), which would replace the Governor-General.[66] De Valera used the sudden abdication of Edward VIII as King to pass two bills: one amended the constitution to remove all mention of the monarch and Governor-General, while the second brought the monarch back, this time through statute law, for use in representing the Irish Free State at a diplomatic level. With the implementation of the Constitution of Ireland (Irish: Bunreacht na h\u00c9ireann), the title ultimately given to the president was President of Ireland (Irish: Uachtar\u00e1n na h\u00c9ireann)./nThe constitution contained reforms and symbols intended to assert Irish sovereignty. These included:/nCriticisms of some of the above constitutional reforms include that:/nAs Paul Bew concludes, in the constitution of 1937 de Valera was \"trying to placate left-wing Republicans with national phrases and pious people with expressly Catholic bits [and] patriarchal Catholicism\".[71]/nThe Constitution was approved in a plebiscite on 1 July 1937 and came into force on 29 December 1937./nBy September 1939, a general European war was imminent. On 2 September, de Valera advised D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann that neutrality was the best policy for the country. This policy had overwhelming political and popular support, though some advocated Irish participation in the war on the Allied side, while others, believing that \"England's difficulty is Ireland's opportunity\", were pro-German. Strong objections to conscription in the North were voiced by de Valera.[72] In June 1940, to encourage the neutral Irish state to join with the Allies, Winston Churchill indicated to de Valera that the United Kingdom would push for Irish unity, but believing that Churchill could not deliver, de Valera declined the offer.[73][74] The day after the attacks on Pearl Harbor Churchill wired de Valera: \"Now is your chance. Now or never! A nation once again. I will meet you wherever you wish.\"[75] The British did not inform the Government of Northern Ireland that they had made the offer to the Irish government, and De Valera's rejection was not publicised until 1970. The government secured wide powers for the duration of the Emergency, such as internment, censorship of the press and correspondence, and the government control of the economy. The Emergency Powers Act lapsed on 2 September 1946, though the State of Emergency declared under the constitution was not lifted until the 1970s.[76][77] This status remained throughout the war, despite pressure from Chamberlain and Churchill. However, de Valera did respond to a request from Northern Ireland for fire tenders to assist in fighting fires following the  1941 Belfast Blitz./nPersistent claims that de Valera sent a personal note of congratulation to Subhas Chandra Bose upon his declaration of the Azad Hind (Free India) government in 1943,[78] have been shown to be inaccurate, and largely a misrepresentation by Japanese consular staff in Dublin of a statement by a small and unofficial Republican group unconnected to the Irish government.[79]/nControversially,[80] de Valera formally offered his condolences to the German ambassador in Dublin on the death of Adolf Hitler in 1945, in accordance with diplomatic protocol.[81] This did some damage to Ireland, particularly in the United States \u2013 and soon afterwards de Valera had a bitter exchange of words with Churchill in two famous radio addresses after the end of the war in Europe.[82] De Valera denounced reports of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp as \"anti-national propaganda\"; according to Bew, this was not out of disbelief but rather because the Holocaust undermined the main assumption underlying Irish neutrality: moral equivalence between the Allies and the Axis.[83]/nThe de Valera government was reputedly harsh with Irish Army deserters who had enlisted to fight with the Allied armies against the Axis.[84] The legislation in question was the Emergency Powers (No. 362) order which was passed in August 1945. On 18 October 1945, Thomas F. O'Higgins moved to annul the order.[85] He did not condone desertion, but felt that the order was specifically harsh on those deserters who had served in the Allied forces. General Richard Mulcahy also spoke against the Order, disagreeing with the way in which it applied to enlisted men and not to officers. It was revoked with effect from 1 August 1946,[86] but was in effect continued by section 13 of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946.[87]/nAfter de Valera had spent sixteen years in power without answering the crucial questions of partition and republican status the public demanded a change from Fianna F\u00e1il government. In the 1948 election, de Valera lost the outright majority he had enjoyed since 1933. It initially looked as if the National Labour Party would give Fianna F\u00e1il enough support to stay in office as a minority government, but National Labour insisted on a formal coalition agreement, something de Valera was unwilling to concede. However, while Fianna F\u00e1il was six seats short of a majority, it was still by far the largest party in the D\u00e1il, with 37 more TDs than the next largest party and rival, Fine Gael (the successor to Cumann na nGaedheal). Conventional wisdom held that de Valera would remain Taoiseach with the support of independent deputies./nThis belief came to nought when (after the final votes were counted) the other parties realised that if they banded together, they would have only one seat fewer than Fianna F\u00e1il, and would be able to form a government with the support of at least seven independents. The result was the First Inter-Party Government, with John A. Costello of Fine Gael as its compromise candidate for Taoiseach. Costello was duly nominated, consigning de Valera to opposition for the first time in 16 years. The following year, Costello declared Ireland as a republic, leaving partition as the most pressing political issue of the day.[88]/nDe Valera, now Leader of the Opposition, left the actual parliamentary practice of opposing the government to his deputy, Se\u00e1n Lemass, and himself embarked on a world campaign to address the issue of partition. He visited the United States, Australia, New Zealand and India, and in the latter country, was the last guest of the Governor-General, Lord Mountbatten of Burma, before he was succeeded by the first Indian-born Governor-General.[89] In Melbourne, Australia, de Valera was feted by the powerful Catholic Archbishop Daniel Mannix, at the centenary celebrations of the diocese of Melbourne. He attended mass-meetings at Xavier College, and addressed the assembled Melbourne Celtic Club.[90] In Brisbane, Australia, at the request of the influential and long serving Archbishop Duhig de Valera laid the foundation stone for the new High School building at Marist Brothers College Rosalie.[91] In October 1950, just thirty years after his dramatic escape from Lincoln Gaol, he returned to Lincoln and received the freedom of the gaol.[92] The Anti-Partition of Ireland League of Great Britain marked the occasion with a dinner in his honour and the toast was 'Anglo-Irish Friendship'.[93] A key message in de Valera's campaign was that Ireland could not join the recently established North Atlantic Treaty Organization as long as Northern Ireland was in British hands; although Costello's government favoured alliance with NATO, de Valera's approach won more widespread support and prevented the state from signing the treaty.[88]/nReturning to Ireland during the Mother and Child Scheme crisis that racked the First Inter-Party Government, de Valera kept silent as Leader of the Opposition, preferring to stay aloof from the controversy. That stance helped return de Valera to power in the 1951 general election, but without an overall majority. His and Fianna F\u00e1il's popularity was short-lived, however; his government introduced severe, deflationary budgetary and economic policies in 1952, causing a political backlash that cost Fianna F\u00e1il several seats in the D\u00e1il in by-elections of 1953 and early 1954. Faced with a likely loss of confidence in the D\u00e1il, de Valera instead called an election in May 1954, in which Fianna F\u00e1il was defeated and a Second Inter-Party Government was formed with John A. Costello again as Taoiseach.[94]/nOn 16 September 1953, de Valera met British Prime Minister Winston Churchill for the first and only time, at 10 Downing Street. (The two men had seen each other at a party in 1949, but without speaking). He surprised the UK Prime Minister by claiming that if he had been in office in 1948 Ireland would not have left the Commonwealth.[95]/nIt was during this period that de Valera's eyesight began to deteriorate and he was forced to spend several months in the Netherlands, where he had six operations. In 1955, while in opposition, de Valera spoke against the formation of a European Parliament and European federalism, noting that Ireland \"did not strive to get out of that British domination [...] to get into a worse [position]\".[96]/nLike the first coalition government, the second lasted only three years. At the general election of 1957, de Valera, then in his seventy-fifth year, won an absolute majority of nine seats, the greatest number he had ever secured. This was the beginning of another sixteen-year period in office for Fianna F\u00e1il. A new economic policy emerged with the First Programme for Economic Expansion. In July 1957, in response to the Border Campaign (IRA), Part II of the Offences Against the State Act was re-activated and he ordered the internment without trial of Republican suspects, an action which did much to end the IRA's campaign.[97]/nDe Valera's final term as Taoiseach also saw the passage of numerous reforms in health and welfare. In 1952, unemployment insurance was extended to male agricultural employees, child allowances were extended to the second child, and a maternity allowance for insured women was introduced. A year later, eligibility for maternity and child services and public hospital services was extended to approximately 85% of the population.[65]/nWhile Fianna F\u00e1il remained popular among the electorate, 75-year-old de Valera had begun to be seen by the electorate as too old and out of touch to remain as head of government.[98] At the urging of party officials, de Valera decided to retire from government and the D\u00e1il and instead seek the presidency of Ireland. He won the 1959 presidential election on 17 June 1959 and resigned as Taoiseach, Leader of Fianna F\u00e1il and a TD for Clare, six days later, handing over power to Se\u00e1n Lemass./nDe Valera was inaugurated President of Ireland on 25 June 1959.[53] He was re-elected President in 1966 aged 84, which until 2013 was a world record for the oldest elected head of state.[99] At his retirement in 1973 at the age of 90, he was the oldest head of state in the world.[98]/nAs President of Ireland, de Valera received many state visits, including the 1963 visit of US president John F. Kennedy. Five months later de Valera attended the state funeral for Kennedy in Washington, D.C., and accompanied a group of 24 Defence Forces cadets who performed a silent drill at his grave site.[98] In June 1964, he returned to Washington, D.C., as the second President of Ireland to address the United States Congress.[100]/nIn 1966, the Dublin Jewish community arranged the planting and dedication of the \u00c9amon de Valera Forest in Israel, near Nazareth, in recognition of his support for Ireland's Jews.[101]/nIn January 1969, de Valera became the first President to address both houses of the Oireachtas, to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann./nIn 1969, seventy-three countries sent goodwill messages to NASA for the historic first lunar landing. These messages still rest on the lunar surface. De Valera's message on behalf of Ireland stated, \"May God grant that the skill and courage which have enabled man to alight upon the Moon will enable him, also, to secure peace and happiness upon the Earth and avoid the danger of self-destruction.\"[102]/n\u00c9amon de Valera died from pneumonia and heart failure in Linden Convalescent Home, Blackrock, Dublin, on 29 August 1975, aged 92.[103] His wife, Sin\u00e9ad de Valera, four years his senior, had died the previous January, on the eve of their 65th wedding anniversary. His body lay in state at Dublin Castle and was given a full state funeral on 3 September at St Mary's Pro-Cathedral, which was broadcast on national television. Over 200,000 people reportedly lined the three-mile funeral route from Dublin city centre to Glasnevin Cemetery.[104] He is buried in Glasnevin alongside his wife and son Brian./nDe Valera's political creed evolved from militant republicanism to social and cultural conservatism.[5]/nIreland's dominant political personality for many decades, de Valera received numerous honours. He was elected Chancellor of the National University of Ireland in 1921, holding the post until his death. Pope John XXIII bestowed on him the Order of Christ (KSC).[105] He received honorary degrees from universities in Ireland and abroad. In 1968, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS),[4] a recognition of his lifelong interest in mathematics. He also served as a member of the Parliament of Northern Ireland (for Down from 1921 to 1929 and for South Down from 1933 to 1937), although he held to the republican policy of abstentionism and did not take his seat in Stormont./nDe Valera was criticised for becoming co-owner of one of Ireland's most influential group of newspapers, Irish Press Newspapers, funded by numerous small investors who received no dividend for decades.[106] De Valera is alleged by critics to have helped keep Ireland under the influence of Catholic conservatism.[107] De Valera rejected, however, demands by organisations like Maria Duce that Roman Catholicism be made the state religion of Ireland, just as he rejected demands by the Irish Christian Front for the Irish Free State to support Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War.[108]/nDe Valera's preoccupation with his part in history, and his need to explain and justify it, are reflected in innumerable ways. His faith in historians as trustworthy guardians of his reputation was not absolute. He made many attempts to influence their views and to adjust and refine the historical record whenever he felt this portrayed him, his allies or his cause inaccurately or unfavourably to his mind, these could often mean the same thing. He extended these endeavours to encompass the larger Irish public. An important function of his newspaper group, the Irish Press group, was to rectify what he saw as the errors and omissions of a decade in which he had been the subject of largely hostile commentary.[109]/nIn recent decades, his role in Irish history has no longer been unequivocally seen by historians as a positive one, and a biography by Tim Pat Coogan alleges[110][page\u00a0needed] that his failures outweigh his achievements, with de Valera's reputation declining while that of his great rival in the 1920s, Michael Collins, was rising. A more recent 2007 work on de Valera by historian Diarmaid Ferriter presents a more positive picture of de Valera's legacy.[111]\nBertie Ahern, at a book launch for Diarmaid Ferriter's biography of de Valera,[5][112] described de Valera's achievements in political leadership during the formative years of the state:/nOne of de Valera's finest hours was his regrouping of the Republican side after defeat in the civil war, and setting his followers on an exclusively peaceful and democratic path, along which he later had to confront both domestic Fascism and the IRA. He became a democratic statesman, not a dictator. He did not purge the civil service of those who had served his predecessors, but made best use of the talent available./nA notable failure was his attempt to reverse the provision of the 1937 Constitution in relation to the electoral system. On retiring as Taoiseach in 1959, he proposed that the Proportional Representation system enshrined in that constitution should be replaced. De Valera argued that Proportional Representation had been responsible for the instability that had characterised much of the post war period. A constitutional referendum to ratify this was defeated by the people. One aspect of de Valera's legacy is that since the foundation of the state, a de Valera has nearly always served in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. \u00c9amon de Valera served until 1959, his son, Vivion de Valera, was also a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD). \u00c9amon \u00d3 Cu\u00edv, his grandson, is currently a member of the D\u00e1il while his granddaughter, S\u00edle de Valera is a former TD. Both have served in ministries in the Irish Government./nIn 1931, de Valera said in the D\u00e1il: \"I believe that every citizen in this country is entitled to his share of public appointments, and that there should not be discrimination on the ground of religion, discrimination, mind you, in the sense that because a person was of a particular religion, religion should not be made an excuse for denying a person an appointment for which he or she was fully qualified. Then there comes the question, what are qualifications? If I thought that the principle that the librarian in a Catholic community should be Catholic was a new principle, introduced merely to deny a Protestant an appointment, I would vote against it, but I know from my youth that it is not so. ... if I had a vote on a local body, and if there were two qualified people who had to deal with a Catholic community, and if one was a Catholic and the other a Protestant, I would unhesitatingly vote for the Catholic. Let us be clear and let us know where we are.\"[113][114][115]  Ryle Dwyer, writing in 2008, said \"If those were his honest views, one could also say without hesitation that the Long Fellow was a bigot. But, in fact, he was just playing the role of a political hypocrite. It was cynical, but it should be stressed that he behaved responsibly in this regard when he came to power.\"[116]/nDe Valera led Fianna F\u00e1il to adopt conservative social policies, since he believed devoutly that the Catholic church and the family were central to Irish identity. He added clauses to the new Constitution of Ireland (1937) to \"guard with special care the institution of marriage\" and prohibit divorce. His constitution also recognised \"the special position\" of the Catholic Church and recognised other denominations including the Church of Ireland and Jewish congregations, while guaranteeing the religious freedom of all citizens; however, he resisted an attempt to make Roman Catholicism the state religion and his constitution forbids the establishment of a state religion. His policies were welcomed by a largely devout, conservative and rural electorate.[117] The unenforceable articles in the constitution which reinforced the traditional view that a woman's place was in the home further illustrate the direction in which Ireland was moving. An act of 1935 prohibited the importation or sale of contraceptives. The most rigorous censorship laws in western Europe complete the picture.[118]/nThe specific recognition of Roman Catholicism was deleted by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland (1973) and the prohibition of divorce was removed by the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland (1996). Nevertheless, the Irish Supreme Court declared in 1973 that the 1935 contraception legislation was not repugnant to the Constitution and therefore remained valid.[119] Subsequent laws have liberalised the use of contraception however, (see Contraception in the Republic of Ireland)./nDe Valera's portrait illustrated the front cover of 25 March 1940 issue of TIME magazine[120] accompanying the article EIRE: Prime Minister of Freedom.[121]/nHe has been portrayed by:/nThe following governments were led by de Valera:/n]", "6038724": "Samuel Klingenstierna (18 August 1698 \u2013 26 October 1765) was a renowned Swedish mathematician and scientist.

Curry is best known for his work in combinatory logic, whose initial concept is based on a paper by Moses Sch\u00f6nfinkel,[1] for which Curry did much of the development. Curry is also known for Curry's paradox and the Curry\u2013Howard correspondence. Named for him are three programming languages: Haskell, Brook, and Curry, and the concept of currying, a method to transform functions, used in mathematics and computer science./nCurry was born on (1900-09-12)12 September 1900 in Millis, Massachusetts, to Samuel Silas Curry and Anna Baright Curry, who ran a school for elocution. He entered Harvard University in 1916 to study medicine but switched to mathematics before graduating in 1920. After two years of graduate work in electrical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), he returned to Harvard to study physics, earning a Master of Arts (M.A.) in 1924. Curry's interest in mathematical logic began during this period when he was introduced to the Principia Mathematica, the attempt by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell to ground mathematics in symbolic logic. Remaining at Harvard, Curry pursued a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in mathematics. While he was directed by George David Birkhoff to work on differential equations, his interests continued to shift to logic. In 1927, while an instructor at Princeton University, he discovered the work of Moses Sch\u00f6nfinkel in combinatory logic. Sch\u00f6nfinkel's work had anticipated much of Curry's own research, and as a consequence, he moved to University of G\u00f6ttingen where he could work with Heinrich Behmann and Paul Bernays, who were familiar with Sch\u00f6nfinkel's work. Curry was supervised by David Hilbert and worked closely with Bernays, receiving a Ph.D. in 1930 with a dissertation on combinatory logic.[2]/nIn 1928, before leaving for G\u00f6ttingen, Curry married Mary Virginia Wheatley. The couple lived in Germany while Curry completed his dissertation, then, in 1929, moved to State College, Pennsylvania where Curry accepted a position at Pennsylvania State College. They had two children, Anne Wright Curry (July 27, 1930) and Robert Wheatley Curry (July 6, 1934). Curry remained at Penn State for the next 37 years. He spent one year at University of Chicago in 1931\u20131932 under a National Research Fellowship and one year in 1938\u20131939 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. In 1942 he took a leave of absence to do applied mathematics for the United States government during World War II, notably at the Frankford Arsenal. Immediately after the war he worked on the ENIAC project, in 1945 and 1946. Under a Fulbright fellowship, he collaborated with Robert Feys in Louvain, Belgium. After retiring from Penn State in 1966, Curry accepted a position at the University of Amsterdam. In 1970, after finishing the second volume of his treatise on the combinatory logic, Curry retired from the University of Amsterdam and returned to State College, Pennsylvania./nHaskell Curry died on 1 September 1982(1982-09-01) (aged\u00a081), in State College, Pennsylvania./nThe focus of Curry's work were attempts to show that combinatory logic could provide a foundation for mathematics. Towards the end of 1933, he learned of the Kleene\u2013Rosser paradox from correspondence with John Rosser. The paradox, developed by Rosser and Stephen Kleene, had proved the inconsistency of a number of related formal systems, including one proposed by Alonzo Church (a system which had the lambda calculus as a consistent subsystem) and Curry's own system.[2] However, unlike Church, Kleene, and Rosser, Curry did not give up on the foundational approach, saying that he did not want to \"run away from paradoxes.\"[3]/nBy working in the area of Combinatory Logic for his entire career, Curry essentially became the founder and biggest name in the field. Combinatory logic is the foundation for one style of functional programming language. The power and scope of combinatory logic are quite similar to that of the lambda calculus of Church, and the latter formalism has tended to predominate in recent decades./nIn 1947 Curry also described one of the first high-level programming languages and provided the first description of a procedure to convert a general arithmetic expression into a code for one-address computer.[4]/nHe taught at Harvard, Princeton, and from 1929 to 1966, at the Pennsylvania State University. In 1942, he published Curry's paradox. In 1966 he became professor of logic and its history and philosophy of exact sciences at the University of Amsterdam, the successor of Evert Willem Beth.[5]/nCurry also wrote and taught mathematical logic more generally; his teaching in this area culminated in his 1963 Foundations of Mathematical Logic.

It is named for him and for the later work of Johann Georg Hagen.[5] The same thesis also included a formula for computing the Taylor series of an inverse function from the Taylor series for the function itself, related to the Lagrange inversion theorem.[6]/nIn the study of permutations, Rothe was the first to define the inverse of a permutation, in 1800. He developed a technique for visualizing permutations now known as a Rothe diagram, a square table that has a dot in each cell (i,j) for which the permutation maps position i to position j and a cross in each cell (i,j) for which there is a dot later in row i and another dot later in column j. Using Rothe diagrams, he showed that the number of inversions in a permutation is the same as in its inverse, for the inverse permutation has as its diagram the transpose of the original diagram, and the inversions of both permutations are marked by the crosses. Rothe used this fact to show that the determinant of a matrix is the same as the determinant of the transpose: if one expands a determinant as a polynomial, each term corresponds to a permutation, and the sign of the term is determined by the parity of its number of inversions. Since each term of the determinant of the transpose corresponds to a term of the original matrix with the inverse permutation and the same number of inversions, it has the same sign, and so the two determinants are also the same.[7]/nIn his 1800 work on permutations, Rothe also was the first to consider permutations that are involutions; that is, they are their own inverse, or equivalently they have symmetric Rothe diagrams.

His most famous invention is that of the stroboscopic disk which has a claim to be the first device to show moving images. Almost simultaneously, a similar device was developed in Belgium (the phenakistiscope)./nSimon Ritter von Stampfer was born in Matrei in Osttirol, and was the first son of  Bartlm\u00e4 Stampfer, a weaver.  From 1801 he attended the local school and in  1804 and moved to the Franciscan Gymnasium in Lienz, where he studied until 1807. From there he went to the Lyceum in Salzburg, to study  philosophy, however he was not assessed./nIn 1814 in Munich, he passed the state examination  and applied there as a teacher. He chose, however, to stay in Salzburg, where he was assistant teacher in mathematics, natural history, physics and Greek at the high school. He then moved to the Lyceum, where he taught elementary mathematics, physics and applied mathematics . In 1819 he was also appointed a professor. In his spare time he made  geodetic measurements, astronomical observations, experiments on the propagation speed of sound at different heights and measurements using the barometer. Stampfer was often to be seen in the Benedictine Monastery of Kremsm\u00fcnster which had numerous pieces of astronomical equipment available./nIn 1822, von Stampfer married Johanna Wagner. They had a daughter  in 1824 (Maria Aloysia Johanna) and in 1825 a son (Anton Josef Simon)./nAfter several unsuccessful applications, in Innsbruck, Stampfer was finally promoted to full professor of pure mathematics in Salzburg. However, at the Polytechnic Institute in Vienna, he was also  promoted to the Chair of Practical Geometry. He settled there in December 1825 to replace Franz Josef von Gerstner. He now taught Practical geometry, but was also employed as a physicist and astronomer. He produced a method for the computation of solar eclipses./nHe was concerned about his astronomical work with lenses and their accuracy and distortion.  This led him to the field of optical illusions. In 1828, he developed test methods for telescopes and methods of measurement to determine the \"Kr\u00fcmmungshalbmesser\" of lenses and the refractive and dispersion property of the glass. For his work on the theoretical foundations of the production of high quality optics, he turned to the achromatic Fraunhofer lens./nIn 1832, Stampfer became aware through the Journal of Physics and Mathematics of experiments by the British physicist, Michael Faraday, on the optical illusion caused by rapidly rotating gears, in which the human eye could not follow the movement of the gear. He was so impressed that he conducted similar experiments with intermittent views through the openings between the teeth of slotted cardboard wheels. From these experiments he eventually developed his Stroboscopische Scheiben (optische Zauberscheiben) (Stroboscopic Discs, or optical magic discs, or simply Stroboscope ), coining the term as a combination of the Ancient Greek words \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2 - strobos, meaning \"whirlpool\" and \u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd - skopein, meaning \"to look at\". In a pamphlet published in July 1833, Stampfer mentioned that the sequence of images could be placed on either a disc, a cylinder (much like the Zoetrope, introduced in 1866) or longer scenes on a looped strip of paper or canvas stretched around two parallel rollers (somewhat similar to film on spools). A disc with pictures could be viewed though a slotted disc on the other side of an axis, but Stampfer found spinning one disc with slots as well as pictures in front of a mirror more simple. He also suggested covering up the view of all but one of the moving figures with a cut-out sheet of cardboard and painting theatrical coulisses and backdrops around the cut-out part (somewhat similar to the later Praxinoscope-Theatre).[1] The patent for the invention also mentions the option of transparent versions. Stampfer and lithographer Mathias Trentsensky chose to publish the invention in the shape of a disc to be viewed in a mirror.[2]/nBelgian scientist Joseph Antoine Ferdinand Plateau had been developing a very similar device for some time and finally published about what would later be named the Fantascope or Ph\u00e9nakisticope in January 1833 in a Belgian scientific periodical, illustrated with a plate of the device.[3] Plateau mentioned in 1836 that he thought it difficult to state the exact time when he got the idea, but he believed he was first able to successfully assemble his invention in December. He stated to trust the assertion of Stampfer to have started his experiments at the same time, which soon resulted in the discovery of the stroboscopic animation principle.[4] Both Stampfer and Plateau have a claim to be the founding father of Cinema. Most cited with this honour however is Joseph Antoine Ferdinand Plateau.[5]/nStampfer received the imperial privilege No. 1920 for his invention on 7 May 1833\u00a0:/nThe device was developed by the Viennese art dealers Trentsensky & Vieweg and commercially marketed.

A classical application is the thin boundary layer that forms on a solid surface as a fluid flows over it. Above the boundary layer, the fluid behaves approximately like a perfect fluid. But within the boundary layer, the velocity of the flow changes rapidly from the high velocity above the boundary layer to a velocity of 0 at the solid surface. Many technical problems can be modeled this way, including the flow of a liquid through a pipe and the flow of air over an airplane wing. Boundary layer problems are instances of a more general class of problems that today is part of the field of singular perturbations./nStarting with his 1941 PhD thesis, Wasow was one of the main contributors to  developing a mathematical theory of the boundary layer problem and singular perturbations.

Of his personal life nothing is known, although he was a contemporary of Aristotle and his works seem to have been completed in Athens between 335\u2013300 BC. Euclid references some of Autolycus' work, and Autolycus is known to have taught Arcesilaus.[citation needed]/nThe lunar crater Autolycus was named in his honour./nAutolycus' two surviving works are about spherical geometry with application to astronomy: On the Moving Sphere and On Risings and Settings (of stars). In late antiquity, both were part of the \"Little Astronomy\",[1] a collection of miscellaneous short works about geometry and astronomy which were commonly transmitted together. They were translated into Arabic in the 9th century,[2] and with the addition of a few additional works became known as the \"Middle Books\" (sitting between Euclid's Elements and Ptolemy's Almagest). Both were preserved both in Greek and in Arabic, but were unknown in medieval Western Europe.

While the obvious application is the diurnal motion of the stars as the celestial sphere appears to rotate about an immobile Earth (as modeled at the time), Autolycus' treatise never explicitly discusses this application: its content consists entirely of elementary theorems about the arcs of great circles and parallel small circles on an abstract sphere. The work is simple and probably derivative of older works, but each theorem includes a clearly enunciated statement, a figure of the construction alongside its proof, and finally a concluding remark.[1]/nOn the Moving Sphere is believed to be the oldest mathematical treatise from ancient Greece that is completely preserved: All prior Greek mathematical works are taken from later summaries, commentaries, or descriptions of the works.[1] It shows that by Autolycus' day there was a thoroughly established textbook tradition in geometry that is today regarded as typical of classical Greek geometry. Moreover, it gives indications of what theorems were well known in his day (around 320 BC).[1]/nTwo hundred years later Theodosius wrote the Spherics, a treatise establishing the fundamental definitions and constructions in spherical geometry whose content is believed to have a common origin with On the Moving Sphere in some pre-Euclidean textbook, possibly written by Eudoxus.  In contrast to later astronomical analyses by Hipparchus (2nd century BC) and Ptolemy (2nd century AD), but similarly to the planar geometry of Euclid's Elements, both Autolycus's work and Theodosius' does not involve concrete quantification or trigonometry: spherical arcs are compared in size, but not given any numerical measure./nIn the two-book treatise On Risings and Settings (Greek: \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u1ff6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b4\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd Per\u00ed epitol\u00f3n ka\u00ed d\u00fdseon), Autolycus studied the relationship between the rising and the setting of the stars throughout the year.

He also dedicated his 1652 book Optica philosophia, to Archduke Leopold of Austria. Near the end of his life, he was an official of the Jesuit house in Rome. Zucchi died in Rome on May 21, 1670./nNiccol\u00f2 Zucchi published many books on science, including two works on the \"philosophy of machines\" (analyses of mechanics) in 1646 and 1649, and Optica philosophia in 1652. He also wrote an unpublished Optica statica, which has not survived. Some of the subjects Zucchi wrote about were magnetism, barometers (denying the existence of the vacuum), and demonstrated that phosphors generate rather than store light. He also asserted that since Venus represented beauty, it was closer to the Sun than Mercury (which represented skill)./nIn 1623, Zucchi was a member of a Papal legate sent to the court of Ferdinand II. There he met Johannes Kepler, the German mathematician and astronomer.[2]/nKepler encouraged Zucchi's interest in astronomy. Zucchi maintained correspondence with Kepler after returning to Rome. At one point when Kepler was in financial difficulties, Zucchi, at the urging of the Jesuit scientist Father Paul Guldin, gave a telescope of his own design to Kepler, who mentioned the gift in his book \u201cThe Dream\u201d.[3]/nZucchi along with fellow Jesuit Daniello Bartoli may have been the first to see the belts on the planet Jupiter on May 17, 1630,[1][4] and Zucchi reported spots on Mars in 1640.

Bartoli wrote his Jesuit biography (1682).[5]/nOne of the things cited by Zucchi in his 1652 book \"Optica philosophia experimentis et ratione a fundamentis constituta\" is his claim of exploring the idea of a reflecting telescope in 1616. Zucchi described an experiment he did with a concave lens and a bronze parabolic mirror he found in a cabinet of curiosities.[7] Zucchi used the concave lens as an eyepiece, trying to observe the focused image produced by the mirror to see if it would work like a telescope.  Although Zucchi described the mirror as \"ab experto et accuratissimo artifice elaboratum nactus\" (fabricated by an experienced craftsman[8]) he apparently did not get a satisfactory image with it, possibly due to the mirror not being accurate enough to focus an image, the angle it was tilted at, or the fact that his head partially obstructed the view.[8] Zucchi abandoned the idea.[9] If Niccol\u00f2 Zucchi's claim of exploring the idea of a reflecting telescope in 1616 was true, then it would be the earliest known description of the idea of using a curved mirror as an image forming objective, predating Galileo Galilei and Giovanni Francesco Sagredo's discussions of the same idea in the 1620s.[8]/nThere are many descriptions of Niccol\u00f2 Zucchi successfully using his early \"reflecting telescope\".\nThe French author Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle's 1700 work History of the Academy of Sciences stated Zucchi used it to observe \"celestial and terrestrial objects\".[10] There are also modern claims that Zucchi used a reflecting telescope to observe the belts of Jupiter and examine the spots on the planet Mars,[11]/nSuch claims have been disputed. The 1832 Edinburgh Encyclop\u00e6dia noted Zucchi's use of a tilted mirror \"must have distorted and spoiled the image\"[10] and the 1858 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica described Fontenelle's claim as \"recklessly (ascribing) the invention\"[7]\nHistorian Al Van Helden notes in his The Galileo Project that the claims Zucchi used a reflecting telescope to observe Jupiter and Mars as \"wildly improbable\".[12] Henry C. King in his work on The History of the Telescope noted that Zucchi was using a refracting (Galilean) telescope in his astronomical work[9] and a publication by the British Astronomical Association notes for some of his observations Zucchi was using refracting telescopes manufactured by Eustachio Divini and Giuseppe Campani.[13]", "2499889": "Navaratna Srinivasa Rajaram (22 September 1943 \u2013 11 December 2019) was an Indian academic.He is notable for propounding the \"Indigenous Aryans\" hypothesis, asserting that the Vedic period was extremely advanced from a scientific view-point, and claiming of having deciphered the Indus script.[1] Academics find his scholarship to be composed of dishonest polemics in service of a communal agenda.[2][3][4][5]/nRajaram was born on 22 September 1943 into a Deshastha Madhva Brahmin family in Mysore.

In order to vindicate their ideology and promote their own ends, these persons appeal to the feelings of the 'common man' who, with full reason, is proud of his or her country's grand heritage. Thus far Rajaram has got away with this dishonesty because the scholarly community has not considered this work worthy of consideration: it has been taken more or less for granted that any sensible person can see through this trash and recognize it as such.

The method is so flexible and easy to follow that one can, without much effort, read into the Indus texts almost any mathematical formula.../nThapar noted Rajaram's writings to resemble nineteenth century tracts that were evidently unfamiliar with tools of historiography but were sprinkled with programming references; so as to suggest scientific objectivity. She also noted that anybody who disagreed with him was branded a Marxist.[10] K. N.

In 1964, following Cartan's advice, he began to work with Alexandre Grothendieck, collaborating with him on two volumes of the latter's S\u00e9minaire de G\u00e9om\u00e9trie Alg\u00e9brique du Bois Marie. In 1970, Illusie introduced the concept of the cotangent complex./nA researcher in the Centre national de la recherche scientifique from 1964 to 1976, Illusie then became a professor at the University of Paris-Sud, retiring as emeritus professor in 2005.[3] Between 1984 and 1995, he was the director of the arithmetic and algebraic geometry group in the department of mathematics of that university. Torsten Ekedahl\u00a0[sv] and G\u00e9rard Laumon are among his students./nIn May 1971, Illusie defended a state doctorate ((in French) Th\u00e8se d\u2019\u00c9tat) entitled \"Cotangent complex; application to the theory of deformations\" at the University of Paris-Sud, in front of a jury composed of \nAlexander Grothendieck, Michel Demazure and Jean-Pierre Serre and presided by Henri Cartan.[4]/nThe thesis was published in French by Springer-Verlag as a two-volume book (in 1971[5] & 1972[6]). The main results of the thesis are summarized in a paper in English (entitled \"Cotangent complex and Deformations of torsors and group schemes\") presented in Halifax, at Dalhousie University, in January 1971 as part of a colloquium on algebraic geometry.[4] This paper, originally published by Springer-Verlag in 1972,[7] also exists in a slightly extended version.[4]/nIllusie's construction of the cotangent complex generalizes that of Michel Andr\u00e9[8] and Daniel Quillen[9] to morphisms of ringed topoi. The generality of the framework makes it possible to apply the formalism to\nvarious first-order deformation problems: schemes, morphisms of schemes,\ngroup schemes and torsors under group schemes. Results concerning commutative\ngroup schemes in particular were the key tool in Grothendieck's proof of his\nexistence and structure theorem for infinitesimal deformations of Barsotti\u2013Tate groups,[10] an ingredient in Gerd Faltings' proof of the Mordell conjecture.

In one field of its application, optimization theory, Ivar Ekeland began his survey of variational principles with this tribute:/nThe central result. The grandfather of it all is the celebrated 1961 theorem of Bishop and Phelps ... that the set of continuous linear functionals on a Banach space E which attain their maximum on a prescribed closed convex bounded subset X\u2282E is norm-dense in E*. The crux of the proof lies in introducing a certain convex cone in E, associating with it a partial ordering, and applying to the latter a transfinite induction argument (Zorn's lemma).[7]/nPhelps has written several advanced monographs, which have been republished. His 1966 Lectures on Choquet theory was the first book to explain the theory of integral representations.[8] In these \"instant classic\" lectures, which were translated into Russian and other languages, and in his original research, Phelps helped to lead the development of Choquet theory and its applications, including probability, harmonic analysis, and approximation theory.[9][10][11] A revised and expanded version of his Lectures on Choquet theory was republished as Phelps (2002).[11]/nPhelps has also contributed to nonlinear analysis, in particular writing notes and a monograph on differentiability and Banach-space theory. In its preface, Phelps advised readers of the prerequisite \"background in functional analysis\": \"the main rule is the separation theorem (a.k.a. [also known as] the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem): Like the standard advice given in mountaineering classes (concerning the all-important bowline for tying oneself into the end of the climbing rope), you should be able to employ it using only one hand while standing blindfolded in a cold shower.\"[12] Phelps has been an avid rock-climber and mountaineer. Following the trailblazing research of Asplund and Rockafellar, Phelps hammered into place the pitons, linked the carabiners, and threaded the top rope by which novices have ascended from the frozen tundras of topological vector spaces to the Shangri-La of Banach space theory. His University College, London (UCL) lectures on the Differentiability of convex functions on Banach spaces (1977\u20131978) were \"widely distributed\".  Some of Phelps's results and exposition were developed in two books,[13] Bourgin's Geometric aspects of convex sets with the Radon-Nikod\u00fdm property (1983) and  Giles's Convex analysis with application in the differentiation of convex functions (1982).[10][14]  Phelps avoided repeating the results previously reported in Bourgin and Giles when he published his own Convex functions, monotone operators and differentiability (1989), which reported new results and streamlined proofs of earlier results.[13] Now, the study of differentiability is a central concern in nonlinear functional analysis.[15][16]\nPhelps has published articles under the pseudonym of John Rainwater.[17]", "59188535": "Gabriella Tarantello (born 15 October 1958)[1] is an Italian mathematician specializing in partial differential equations, differential geometry, and gauge theory.

Arenstorf (November 7, 1929 \u2013 September 18, 2014) was an American mathematician. He discovered a stable orbit between the Earth and the Moon, called an Arenstorf Orbit. It was the basis of the orbit used by the Apollo Program for going to the Moon.[1]/nArenstorf received his Ph.D. from the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz in 1956./nAt the time when the United States was attempting to go to the Moon, no solution was known for orbiting regularly around two objects, such as a spacecraft traveling between the Earth and the Moon. This is a special case of the three-body problem, for which a general analytical solution is not known. However, the case of an Earth-Moon satellite can be simplified to four interactions (from the usual 6), because although the three objects gravitationally pull on each other, the effect of the spacecraft's gravity upon the motion of the vastly more massive Earth and Moon is negligible./nArenstorf found a stable orbit for a spacecraft orbiting between the Earth and Moon, shaped like an \"8\" with the Earth or Moon located inside the loops of the \"8\". For a permanent presence on the Moon, it would be the path of what Arenstorf calls a \"Space Bus\", a ferry that could periodically transport supplies and people between the Earth and Moon without directly expending fuel. By staying on the Arenstorf orbit, lunar astronauts could efficiently return to Earth. Before leaving NASA after the first Moon landing, Arenstorf mapped out an emergency rescue orbit. This orbit was used in the Apollo 13 incident, in which a catastrophic malfunction aborted the Moon landing, but the astronauts ultimately returned to Earth without a major course adjustment.[citation needed]/nAfter leaving NASA, Arenstorf became a professor of mathematics at Vanderbilt University, where he specialized in celestial mechanics and analytic number theory.

He later went on to become a professor of physics at the Coll\u00e8ge de France around 1800, and three years later was elected as a member of the French Academy of Sciences. In July 1804, Biot joined Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac for the first scientific hot-air balloon ride to measure how the Earth's magnetic field varies with elevation (NNDB 2009, Reese 2004,[5] O'Connor and Robertson 1997). They reached a height of 4000 metres (13,100 feet) (NNDB 2009, Reese 2004).  Later, in Sept. 1804, a solo flight took  Gay-Lussac up to 7010 metres (23,000\u00a0ft) (quite dangerous without supplementary oxygen (Reese 2004))./nBiot was also a member of the Legion of Honour; he was elected chevalier in 1814 and commander in 1849. In 1815, he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London,[6] in 1816 a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and 1822 a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[7] In addition, Biot received the Rumford Medal in 1840, awarded by the Royal Society in the field of thermal or optical properties of matter. (O\u2019Connor and Robertson 1997). In 1850 Jean-Baptiste Biot published in the Journal des savants a 7-page memoir from his recollections of the period of the late 1790s and early 1800s concerning his encounters with Laplace.[8][9]/nJean-Baptiste Biot had a single son, \u00c9douard Constant Biot, an engineer and Sinologist, born in 1803. Edouard died in 1850 and his father made extraordinary efforts to ready for publication the second half of Edouard's last book, a reference translation of the Chinese classic Tcheou-li. It had been left in manuscript, unfinished. To publish it in correct form, Jean-Baptiste Biot wrote, he had to  consult Stanislas Julien, the famous Sinologist, but also, especially for the translation of the most difficult part, the Kaogongji, he himself visited many workshops and questioned artisans and craftsmen about their methods and vocabulary in order to verify his son's work. Biot's translation remains to this day the only translation into a Western language of this book./nHe died in Paris on 3 February 1862./nJean-Baptiste Biot made many contributions to the scientific community in his lifetime \u2013 most notably in optics, magnetism, and astronomy. The Biot\u2013Savart law in magnetism is named after Biot and his colleague F\u00e9lix Savart for their work in 1820.[10] In their experiment they showed a connection between electricity and magnetism by \"starting with a long vertical wire and a magnetic needle some horizontal distance apart [and showing] that running a current through the wire caused the needle to move\" (Parsley)./nIn 1803 Biot was sent by the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise to report back on 3000 meteorites that fell on L'Aigle, in Normandy, France (see L'Aigle (meteorite)). He found that the meteorites, called \"stones\" at the time, were from outer space.[11] With his report, Biot helped support the German physicist Ernst Chladni's argument, published in 1794, that meteorites were debris from space.[12]/nPrior to Biot's thorough investigation of the meteorites that fell near l'Aigle, France in 1803, very few truly believed that rocks found on Earth could have extraterrestrial origins. There were anecdotal tales of unusual rocks found on the ground after fireballs had been seen in the sky, but such stories were often dismissed as fantasy. Serious debate concerning the unusual rocks began in 1794 when Ernst Chladni published a book claiming that such rocks had an extraterrestrial origin (Westrum). Only after Biot was able to analyse the rocks at l'Aigle was it commonly accepted that the fireballs seen in the sky were meteors falling through the atmosphere. Since Biot's time, analysis of meteorites has resulted in accurate measurements of the chemical composition of the solar system. The composition and position of meteors in the solar system have also given astronomers clues as to how the solar system formed./nIn 1812, Biot turned his attention to the study of optics, particularly the polarization of light. Prior to the 19th century, light was believed to consist of discrete packets called corpuscles. During the early 19th century, many scientists began to disregard the corpuscular theory in favor of the wave theory of light. Biot began his work on polarization to show that the results he was obtaining could appear only if light were made of corpuscles./nIn 1815 he demonstrated that \"polarized light, when passing through an organic substance, could be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise, dependent upon the optical axis of the material.\"[13][14] His work in chromatic polarization and rotary polarization greatly advanced the field of optics, although it was later shown that his findings could also be obtained using the wave theory of light.[15]/nBiot's work on the polarization of light has led to many breakthroughs in the field of optics. Liquid crystal displays (LCDs), such as television and computer screens, use light that is polarized by a filter as it enters the liquid crystal, to allow the liquid crystal to modulate the intensity of the transmitted light. This happens as the liquid crystal's polarisation varies in response to an electric control signal applied across it. Polarizing filters are used extensively in photography to cut out unwanted reflections or to enhance reflection./nPotassium bitartrate was first discovered inside a wine container in Iran. The modern application of the substance began in 1768, and in 1832, Jean Baptiste Biot discovered the physical properties of cream of tartar.

Although he was initially close to Sun Hao, he gradually became alienated from the emperor as other officials slandered him in front of the emperor and as he became more outspoken against the emperor's outrageous behaviour. In 266, he offended Sun Hao and ended up losing his head. Sun Hao also exiled his family to the remote Guang Province in the south. Lu Kai, the Imperial Chancellor of Wu during Sun Hao's reign, lamented Wang Fan's unfortunate end./nWang Fan had two brothers, Wang Zhu (\u738b\u8457) and Wang Yan (\u738b\u5ef6), who were also well-known learned men in Wu. Both of them were killed during a rebellion started by Guo Ma in 279, which was one of the events leading to the fall of Wu in 280./nWang Fan was proficient in mathematics and astronomy. He calculated the distance from the Sun to the Earth, but his geometric model was not correct. In addition, he gave the numerical value of \u03c0 as 142 / 45 = 3.155\u2026,[1][2] which was not as accurate as that given by the mathematician Liu Hui, who lived around the same time as him.", "19178914": "Joseph Jean Baptiste Neuberg (30 October 1840 \u2013 22 March 1926) was a Luxembourger mathematician who worked primarily in geometry./nNeuberg was born on 30 October 1840 in Luxembourg City, Luxembourg. He first studied at a local school, the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e de Luxembourg, then progressed to Ghent University, studying at the \u00c9cole normale des Sciences of the science faculty. After graduation, Neuberg taught at several institutions. Between 1862 and 1865, he taught at the \u00c9cole Normale de Nivelle.

He became an extraordinary professor in the university in the same city in 1884, and was promoted to ordinary professor in 1887. He held this latter position until his retirement in 1910. A year after his retirement, he was elected president of the Belgian Royal Academy, which he had joined earlier, in 1866, after taking Belgian nationality despite his origins.[1]/nThe professor died on 22 March 1926 in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium,[1] and was commemorated in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society.[2]/nNeuberg worked mainly in geometry, particularly the geometry of the triangle,[1] The Neuberg cubic, a curve defined from a triangle, is named after him, and passes through the isodynamic points of a triangle which he discovered and published in 1885.[3]/nNeuberg was also involved in a number of mathematical journals. With Eug\u00e8ne Catalan and Paul Mansion, he founded the journal Nouvelle correspondance math\u00e9matique. This journal was founded to honour the earlier journal Correspondance math\u00e9matique et physique, which had been edited by Lambert Quetelet and Jean Garnier. Correspondance was published until 1880; after this, Catalan advised Mansion and Neuberg to continue publication of a new journal. They followed his advice, creating Mathesis in 1881, which is perhaps Neuberg's best-known journal.[1]/nSeveral mathematical societies included Neuberg: the Institute of Science of Luxembourg, the Royal Society of Science of Li\u00e8ge, Mathematical Society of Amsterdam, and the Belgian Royal Academy noted in the biography above.[1]", "18589091": "Ron Eglash (born December 25, 1958, in Chestertown, Maryland) is an American who works in cybernetics, professor in the School of Information at the University of Michigan with a secondary appointment in the School of Design, and an author widely known for his work in the field of ethnomathematics, which aims to study the diverse relationships between mathematics and culture./nHis research includes the use of fractal patterns in African architecture, art, and religion, and the relationships between indigenous cultures and modern technology, such as that between Native American cultural and spiritual practices and cybernetics.  He holds a bachelor's degree in cybernetics and a master's in systems engineering both at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a Ph.D. in history of consciousness at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

With the help of her family support, she finished her schooling and college, which wasn't much accessible to the women that time due to the cultural norms prevalent in India. It was during that time, when she discovered her talent for mathematics. Her pursuit of mathematics was influenced by her mother, who, after confronting the limitations of her own lack of formal education, learned multiple languages and advocated for her daughters' education. Laskar, not allowed to attend college due to her father's reservations, continued her studies at home with the assistance of tutors.

His first papers, covering many topics, were published in 1952. He generalised a theorem due to Wilhelm Magnus, and worked on the structure of tensor spaces. In 1953 he published a joint paper with Kurt Mahler on pseudo-valuations and in 1954 he published a work on Lie algebras.[3] Papers over the next few years covered areas such as group theory, field theory, Lie rings, semigroups, Abelian groups and ring theory. After that, he moved into the areas of Jordan algebras, skew fields,  and non-commutative unique factorisation domains./nIn 1957 Cohn published his first book, Lie Groups, on groups that are analytic manifolds: Lie groups. His second book, Linear Equations, appeared in 1958 and his third, Solid geometry, in 1961. Universal algebra appeared in 1965 (second edition 1981). After that, he concentrated on non-commutative ring theory and the theory of algebras.[3] His monograph Free Rings and their Relations appeared in 1971. It covered the work of Cohn and others on free associative algebras and related classes of rings, especially free ideal rings. He included all of his own published results on the embedding of rings into skew fields. The second, enlarged edition appeared in 1985.[3]/nCohn also wrote undergraduate textbooks. Algebra I appeared in 1974 and Algebra II in 1977. The second edition, in three volumes, was published by Wiley between 1982 and 1991.[3] These volumes were in line with the British (rather than American) curricula at the time and include both linear algebra and abstract algebra. Cohn wrote a subsequent revised iteration the first volume as Classical Algebra (Wiley, 2000) as a more \"user friendly\" version for undergraduates (according to its preface); this book also includes a few selected topics from volumes II and III of Algebra./nThe final incarnation of Cohn's algebra textbooks appeared in 2003 as two Springer volumes Basic Algebra and Further Algebra and Applications. The material in Basic Algebra is (according to its preface) rather more concise and, while corresponding roughly with Algebra I, assumes knowledge of linear algebra. The material on basic theories (groups, rings, fields) is pursued in more depth in Basic Algebra compared to Algebra I. Further Algebra and Applications roughly corresponds to volumes II and III of Algebra, but reflects the shift of some material from these volumes to Basic Algebra./nHis recreation was etymology and language in all its forms.

After witnessing the destruction of the wilderness surrounding his cabin, he concluded that living in nature was becoming impossible and resolved to fight industrialization and its destruction of nature through terrorism. In 1979, Kaczynski became the subject of what was, by the time of his arrest in 1996, the longest and most expensive investigation in the history of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI used the case identifier UNABOM (University and Airline Bomber) before his identity was known, resulting in the media naming him the \"Unabomber\"./nIn 1995, Kaczynski sent a letter to The New York Times promising to \"desist from terrorism\" if the Times or The Washington Post published his manifesto, in which he argued that his bombings were extreme but necessary in attracting attention to the erosion of human freedom and dignity by modern technologies.[4] The FBI and U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno pushed for the publication of the essay, which appeared in The Washington Post in September 1995. Upon reading it, Kaczynski's brother, David, recognized the prose style and reported his suspicions to the FBI. After his arrest in 1996, Kaczynski\u2014maintaining that he was sane\u2014tried and failed to dismiss his court-appointed lawyers because they wished him to plead insanity to avoid the death penalty.

After testing scored his IQ at 167,[10] he skipped the sixth grade. Kaczynski later described this as a pivotal event: previously he had socialized with his peers and was even a leader, but after skipping ahead of them he felt he did not fit in with the older children, who bullied him.[11]/nNeighbors in Evergreen Park later described the Kaczynski family as \"civic-minded folks\", one recalling the parents \"sacrificed everything they had for their children.\"[8] Both Ted and David were intelligent, but Ted was exceptionally bright. Neighbors described him as a smart but lonely individual.[8][12]/nKaczynski attended Evergreen Park Community High School, where he excelled academically. He played the trombone in the marching band and was a member of the mathematics, biology, coin, and German clubs.[13][14] In 1996, a former classmate said: \"He was never really seen as a person, as an individual personality\u00a0... He was always regarded as a walking brain, so to speak.\"[8] During this period, Kaczynski became intensely interested in mathematics, spending hours studying and solving advanced problems. He became associated with a group of like-minded boys interested in science and mathematics, known as the \"briefcase boys\" for their penchant of carrying briefcases.[14]/nThroughout high school, Kaczynski was ahead of his classmates academically. Placed in a more advanced mathematics class, he soon mastered the material. He skipped the eleventh grade, and, by attending summer school, he graduated at age 15. Kaczynski was one of his school's five National Merit finalists and was encouraged to apply to Harvard University.[13] While still at age 15, he was accepted to Harvard and entered the university on a scholarship in 1958 at age 16.[15] A classmate later said Kaczynski was emotionally unprepared: \"They packed him up and sent him to Harvard before he was ready\u00a0... He didn't even have a driver's license.\"[8]/nKaczynski matriculated at Harvard as a mathematics prodigy. During his first year at the university, Kaczynski lived at 8 Prescott Street, which was intended to provide a small, intimate living space for the youngest, most precocious incoming students. For the following three years, he lived at Eliot House. His housemates and other students at Harvard described Kaczynski as a very intelligent but socially reserved person.[16] He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from Harvard in 1962, finishing with a GPA of 3.12.[17][18][19]/nIn his second year at Harvard, Kaczynski participated in a study described by author Alston Chase as a \"purposely brutalizing psychological experiment\" led by Harvard psychologist Henry Murray. Subjects were told they would debate personal philosophy with a fellow student and were asked to write essays detailing their personal beliefs and aspirations. The essays were given to an anonymous individual who would confront and belittle the subject in what Murray himself called \"vehement, sweeping, and personally abusive\" attacks, using the content of the essays as ammunition.[20] Electrodes monitored the subject's physiological reactions. These encounters were filmed, and subjects' expressions of anger and rage were later played back to them repeatedly.[20] The experiment lasted three years, with someone verbally abusing and humiliating Kaczynski each week.[21][22] Kaczynski spent 200 hours as part of the study.[23]/nKaczynski's lawyers later attributed his hostility towards mind control techniques to his participation in Murray's study.[20] During the Second World War, Murray had worked with the Office of Strategic Services, a U.S. intelligence agency often referred to as the predecessor to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), where he conducted psychological experiments.[24] Some sources have suggested that Murray's experiments were part of Project MKUltra, the CIA's program of research into mind control.[25][26] Chase and others have also suggested that this experience may have motivated Kaczynski's criminal activities.[27][28] Kaczynski stated he resented Murray and his co-workers, primarily because of the invasion of his privacy he perceived as a result of their experiments. Nevertheless, he said he was \"quite confident that [his] experiences with Professor Murray had no significant effect on the course of [his] life.\"[29]/nIn 1962, Kaczynski enrolled at the University of Michigan, where he earned his master's and doctoral degrees in mathematics in 1964 and 1967, respectively. Michigan was not his first choice for postgraduate education; he had applied to the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Chicago, both of which accepted him but offered him no teaching position or financial aid. Michigan offered him an annual grant of $2,310 (equivalent to $22,348 in 2022) and a teaching post.[19]/nAt Michigan, Kaczynski specialized in complex analysis, specifically geometric function theory. Professor Peter Duren said of Kaczynski, \"He was an unusual person. He was not like the other graduate students. He was much more focused about his work. He had a drive to discover mathematical truth.\" George Piranian, another of his Michigan mathematics professors, said, \"It is not enough to say he was smart.\"[30] Professor Allen Shields wrote about Kaczynski in a grade evaluation that he was the \"best man I have seen.\"[31] Kaczynski received one F, five B's and twelve A's in his eighteen courses at the university. In 2006, he said he had unpleasant memories of Michigan and felt the university had low standards for grading, considering his relatively high grades.[19]/nFor a period of several weeks in 1966, Kaczynski experienced intense sexual fantasies of being female and decided to undergo gender transition. He arranged to meet with a psychiatrist but changed his mind in the waiting room and discussed other things instead, without disclosing his original reason for making the appointment. Afterwards, enraged, he considered killing the psychiatrist and other people whom he hated. Kaczynski described this episode as a \"major turning point\" in his life.[32][33] He recalled: \"I felt disgusted about what my uncontrolled sexual cravings had almost led me to do. And I felt humiliated, and I violently hated the psychiatrist. Just then there came a major turning point in my life. Like a Phoenix, I burst from the ashes of my despair to a glorious new hope.\"[34]/nIn 1967, Kaczynski's dissertation, Boundary Functions,[35] won the Sumner B. Myers Prize for Michigan's best mathematics dissertation of the year.[8] Allen Shields, his doctoral advisor, called it \"the best I have ever directed\",[19] and Maxwell Reade, a member of his dissertation committee, said, \"I would guess that maybe 10 or 12 men in the country understood or appreciated it.\"[8][30]/nIn late 1967, the 25-year-old Kaczynski became an acting assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley, where he taught mathematics. He assumed the position as the youngest assistant professor in the history of the university.[36] By September 1968, Kaczynski was formally appointed to an assistant professorship, a sign that he was on track for tenure.[8] His teaching evaluations suggested he was not well-liked by his students\u2014he seemed uncomfortable teaching, taught straight from the textbook and refused to answer questions.[8]/nWithout any explanation, Kaczynski resigned on June 30, 1969.[35] In a 1970 letter written by John W. Addison Jr., the chairman of the mathematics department, to Kaczynski's doctoral advisor Shields, Addison referred to the resignation as \"quite out of the blue\".[37][38] He added that \"Kaczynski seemed almost pathologically shy\", and that, as far as he knew, Kaczynski made no close friends in the department, noting that efforts to bring him more into the \"swing of things\" had failed.[39][40]/nIn 1996, reporters for the Los Angeles Times interviewed mathematicians about Kaczynski's work and concluded that Kaczynski's subfield effectively ceased to exist after the 1960s, as most of its conjectures had been proven. According to mathematician Donald Rung, if Kaczynski had continued to work in mathematics, he \"probably would have gone on to some other area\".[35]/nAfter resigning from Berkeley, Kaczynski moved to his parents' home in Lombard, Illinois. Two years later, in 1971, he moved to a remote cabin he had built outside Lincoln, Montana, where he could live a simple life with little money and without electricity or running water,[41] working odd jobs and receiving significant financial support from his family.[8]/nKaczynski's original goal was to become self-sufficient so he could live autonomously. He used an old bicycle to get to town, and a volunteer at the local library said he visited frequently to read classic works in their original languages. Other Lincoln residents said later that such a lifestyle was typical in the area.[42] Kaczynski's cabin was described by a census taker in the 1990 census as containing a bed, two chairs, storage trunks, a gas stove, and lots of books.[13]/nStarting in 1975, Kaczynski performed acts of sabotage including arson and booby trapping against developments near his cabin.[43] He also dedicated himself to reading about sociology and political philosophy, including the works of Jacques Ellul.[20] Kaczynski's brother David later stated that Ellul's book The Technological Society \"became Ted's Bible\".[44] Kaczynski recounted in 1998, \"When I read the book for the first time, I was delighted, because I thought, 'Here is someone who is saying what I have already been thinking.'\"[20]/nIn an interview after his arrest, Kaczynski recalled being shocked on a hike to one of his favorite wild spots:[45]/nIt's kind of rolling country, not flat, and when you get to the edge of it you find these ravines that cut very steeply in to cliff-like drop-offs and there was even a waterfall there. It was about a two days' hike from my cabin. That was the best spot until the summer of 1983. That summer there were too many people around my cabin so I decided I needed some peace. I went back to the plateau and when I got there I found they had put a road right through the middle of it\u00a0... You just can't imagine how upset I was. It was from that point on I decided that, rather than trying to acquire further wilderness skills, I would work on getting back at the system. Revenge./nKaczynski was visited multiple times in Montana by his father, who was impressed by Ted's wilderness skills. Kaczynski's father was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in 1990 and held a family meeting without Kaczynski later that year to map out their future.[13] On October 2, 1990, Kaczynski's father shot and killed himself in his home.[46]/nBetween 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski mailed or hand-delivered a series of increasingly sophisticated bombs that cumulatively killed three people and injured 23 others. Sixteen bombs were attributed to Kaczynski. While the bombing devices varied widely through the years, many contained the initials \"FC\", which Kaczynski later said stood for \"Freedom Club\",[47] inscribed on parts inside. He purposely left misleading clues in the devices and took extreme care in preparing them to avoid leaving fingerprints; fingerprints found on some of the devices did not match those found on letters attributed to Kaczynski.[48][a]/nKaczynski's first mail bomb was directed at Buckley Crist, a professor of materials engineering at Northwestern University. On May 25, 1978, a package bearing Crist's return address was found in a parking lot at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The package was \"returned\" to Crist, who was suspicious because he had not sent it, so he contacted campus police. Officer Terry Marker opened the package, which exploded and caused minor injuries.[51] Kaczynski had returned to Chicago for the May 1978 bombing and stayed there for a time to work with his father and brother at a foam rubber factory. In August 1978, his brother fired him for writing insulting limericks about a female supervisor Ted had courted briefly.[52][53] The supervisor later recalled Kaczynski as intelligent and quiet but remembered little of their acquaintanceship and firmly denied they had had any romantic relationship.[54] Kaczynski's second bomb was sent nearly one year after the first one, again to Northwestern University. The bomb, concealed inside a cigar box and left on a table, caused minor injuries to graduate student John Harris when he opened it.[51]/nIn 1979, a bomb was placed in the cargo hold of American Airlines Flight 444, a Boeing 727 flying from Chicago to Washington, D.C. A faulty timing mechanism prevented the bomb from exploding, but it released smoke, which caused the pilots to carry out an emergency landing. Authorities said it had enough power to \"obliterate the plane\" had it exploded.[51] \"Kaczynski had used a barometer-triggered device, and it had succeeded only in setting some mailbags on fire and forcing an emergency landing; in a letter written years later, the Unabomber expressed relief that the airline bomb had failed, since its target had been too indiscriminate.\"[55] Kaczynski sent his next bomb to the president of United Airlines, Percy Wood. Wood received cuts and burns over most of his body.[56]/nKaczynski left false clues in most bombs, which he intentionally made hard to find to make them appear more legitimate. Clues included metal plates stamped with the initials \"FC\" hidden somewhere (usually in the pipe end cap) in bombs, a note left in a bomb that did not detonate reading \"Wu\u2014It works! I told you it would\u2014RV,\" and the Eugene O'Neill one-dollar stamps often used as postage on his boxes.[48][57][58] He sent one bomb embedded in a copy of Sloan Wilson's novel Ice Brothers.[51] The FBI theorized that Kaczynski's crimes involved a theme of nature, trees and wood. He often included bits of a tree branch and bark in his bombs; his selected targets included Percy Wood and Leroy Wood. The crime writer Robert Graysmith noted his \"obsession with wood\" was \"a large factor\" in the bombings.[59]/nIn 1981, a package bearing the return address of a Brigham Young University professor of electrical engineering, LeRoy Wood Bearnson, was discovered in a hallway at the University of Utah. It was brought to the campus police and was defused by a bomb squad.[60][51] In May of the following year, a bomb was sent to Patrick C. Fischer, a professor of computer science at Vanderbilt University. The package exploded when Fischer's secretary, Janet Smith, opened it, and Smith received injuries to her face and arms.[51][61]/nKaczynski's next two bombs targeted people at the University of California, Berkeley. The first, in July 1982, caused serious injuries to engineering professor Diogenes Angelakos.[51] Nearly three years later, in May 1985, John Hauser, a graduate student and captain in the United States Air Force, lost four fingers and the vision in one eye.[62] Kaczynski handcrafted the bomb from wooden parts.[63] A bomb sent to the Boeing Company in Auburn, Washington, was defused by a bomb squad the following month.[62] In November 1985, professor James V. McConnell and research assistant Nicklaus Suino were both severely injured after Suino opened a mail bomb addressed to McConnell.[62]/nIn late 1985, a nail-and-splinter-loaded bomb in the parking lot of a computer store in Sacramento, California, killed 38-year-old owner of the store, Hugh Scrutton. On February\u00a020, 1987, a bomb disguised as a piece of lumber injured Gary Wright in the parking lot of a computer store in Salt Lake City, Utah; nerves in Wright's left arm were severed, and at least 200 pieces of shrapnel entered his body. Kaczynski was spotted while planting the Salt Lake City bomb. This led to a widely distributed sketch of the suspect as a hooded man with a mustache and aviator sunglasses.[64][65]/nIn 1993, after a six-year break, Kaczynski mailed a bomb to the home of Charles Epstein from the University of California, San Francisco. Epstein lost several fingers upon opening the package. In the same weekend, Kaczynski mailed a bomb to David Gelernter, a computer science professor at Yale University. Gelernter lost sight in one eye, hearing in one ear, and a portion of his right hand.[66]/nIn 1994, Burson-Marsteller executive Thomas J. Mosser was killed after opening a mail bomb sent to his home in New Jersey. In a letter to The New York Times, Kaczynski wrote he had sent the bomb because of Mosser's work repairing the public image of Exxon after the Exxon Valdez oil spill.[67] This was followed by the 1995 murder of Gilbert Brent Murray, president of the timber industry lobbying group California Forestry Association, by a mail bomb addressed to previous president William Dennison, who had retired. Geneticist Phillip Sharp at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology received a threatening letter shortly afterwards.[66]/nIn 1995, Kaczynski mailed several letters[68]  to media outlets outlining his goals and demanding a major newspaper print his 35,000-word essay Industrial Society and Its Future (dubbed the \"Unabomber manifesto\" by the FBI) verbatim.[69][70] He stated he would \"desist from terrorism\" if this demand was met.[4][71][72] There was controversy as to whether the essay should be published, but Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh recommended its publication out of concern for public safety and in the hope that a reader could identify the author. Bob Guccione of Penthouse volunteered to publish it. Kaczynski replied Penthouse was less \"respectable\" than The New York Times and The Washington Post, and said that, \"to increase our chances of getting our stuff published in some 'respectable' periodical\", he would \"reserve the right to plant one (and only one) bomb intended to kill, after our manuscript has been published\" if Penthouse published the document instead of The Times or The Post.[73] The Washington Post published the essay on September 19, 1995.[74][75]/nKaczynski used a typewriter to write his manuscript, capitalizing entire words for emphasis, in lieu of italics. He always referred to himself as either \"we\" or \"FC\" (\"Freedom Club\"), though there is no evidence that he worked with others. Donald Wayne Foster analyzed the writing at the request of Kaczynski's defense team in 1996 and noted that it contained irregular spelling and hyphenation, along with other linguistic idiosyncrasies. This led him to conclude that Kaczynski was its author.[76]/nIndustrial Society and Its Future begins with Kaczynski's assertion: \"The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race.\"[77][78] He wrote that technology has had a destabilizing effect on society, has made life unfulfilling, and has caused widespread psychological suffering.[79] Kaczynski argued that most people spend their time engaged in ultimately unfulfilling pursuits because of technological advances; he called these \"surrogate activities\", wherein people strive toward artificial goals, including scientific work, consumption of entertainment, political activism, and following sports teams.[79] He predicted that further technological advances would lead to extensive and ultimately oppressive forms of human control, including genetic engineering, and that human beings would be adjusted to meet the needs of social systems rather than vice versa.[79] Kaczynski stated that technological progress can be stopped, in contrast to the viewpoint of people who he said understand technology's negative effects yet passively accept technology as inevitable.[80] He called for a revolution to force the collapse of the worldwide technological system,[81] and held a life close to nature, in particular primitivist lifestyles, as an ultimate ideal.[79] Kaczynski's critiques of civilization bore some similarities to anarcho-primitivism, but he rejected and criticized anarcho-primitivist views.[82][83][84]/nKaczynski argued that the erosion of human freedom is a natural product of an industrial society because, in his words, \"the system has to regulate human behavior closely in order to function\", and that reform of the system is impossible.[85] He said that the system has not yet fully achieved control over all human behavior and is in the midst of a struggle to gain that control. Kaczynski predicted that the system would break down if it cannot achieve significant control, and that it is likely this issue would be decided within the next 40 to 100 years.[85] He stated that the task of those who oppose industrial society is to promote stress within and upon the society and to propagate an anti-technology ideology, one that offers the counter-ideal of nature. Kaczynski added that a revolution would be possible only when industrial society is sufficiently unstable.[85]/nA significant portion of the document is dedicated to discussing political leftism as a manifestation of a set of related psychological types, with Kaczynski attributing the prevalence and intensity of leftism in society as both a negative symptom of psychological pressures induced by technological conditions as well as an obstacle to the formation of an effective anti-tech revolution.[85][86] He defined leftists as \"mainly socialists, collectivists, 'politically correct' types, feminists, gay and disability activists, animal rights activists and the like\".[87] He believed that over-socialization and feelings of inferiority are primary drivers of leftism,[79] and derided it as \"one of the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of our world\".[87] Kaczynski added that the type of movement he envisioned must be anti-leftist and refrain from collaboration with leftists as, in his view, \"leftism is in the long run inconsistent with wild nature, with human freedom and with the elimination of modern technology\".[77]/nAlthough Kaczynski and his manifesto has been embraced by ecofascists,[88] he rejected fascism,[89] including those whom he referred to as \"the 'ecofascists'\", describing ecofascism as \"an aberrant branch of leftism\".[90][91] In \"Ecofascism: An Aberrant Branch of Leftism\", he wrote: \"The true anti-tech movement rejects every form of racism or ethnocentrism. This has nothing to do with 'tolerance,' 'diversity,' 'pluralism,' 'multiculturalism,' 'equality,' or 'social justice.' The rejection of racism and ethnocentrism is\u00a0\u2013 purely and simply\u00a0\u2013 a cardinal point of strategy.\"[90]  Kaczynski wrote that he considered fascism a \"kook ideology\" and Nazism as \"evil\".[89] Kaczynski never tried to align himself with the far-right at any point before or after his arrest.[89] He also criticized conservatives, describing them as \"fools who whine about the decay of traditional values, yet... enthusiastically support technological progress and economic growth\"\u2014things he argues have led to this decay.[87]/nJames Q. Wilson, in a 1998 New York Times op-ed, wrote: \"If it is the work of a madman, then the writings of many political philosophers\u2014Jean Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Paine, Karl Marx\u2014are scarcely more sane.\"[92] He added: \"The Unabomber does not like socialization, technology, leftist political causes or conservative attitudes. Apart from his call for an (unspecified) revolution, his paper resembles something that a very good graduate student might have written.\"[93]/nAlston Chase, a fellow alumnus at Harvard University, wrote in 2000 for The Atlantic that \"it is true that many believed Kaczynski was insane because they needed to believe it. But the truly disturbing aspect of Kaczynski and his ideas is not that they are so foreign but that they are so familiar.\" He argued: \"We need to see Kaczynski as exceptional\u2014madman or genius\u2014because the alternative is so much more frightening.\"[94]/nUniversity of Michigan\u2013Dearborn philosophy professor David Skrbina wrote the introduction to Kaczynski's 2010 anthology Technological Slavery, which includes the original manifesto, letters from Kaczynski to Skrbina, and other essays.[95] Two further editions have been published since 2010, one in 2019 and another in 2022.[96] Kaczynski also wrote a second book in 2016 titled, Anti-Tech Revolution: Why and How, that does not include the manifesto, but delves deeply into an analysis of why technological society cannot be reformed and the dynamics of revolutionary movements.[97][98][99]/nAccording to a 2021 study, Kaczynski's manifesto \"is a synthesis of ideas from three well-known academics: French philosopher Jacques Ellul, British zoologist Desmond Morris, and American psychologist Martin Seligman.\"[100]/nBecause of the material used to make the mail bombs, U.S. postal inspectors, who initially had responsibility for the case, labeled the suspect the \"Junkyard Bomber\".[101] FBI Inspector Terry D. Turchie was appointed to run the UNABOM (University and Airline Bomber) investigation.[102] In 1979, an FBI-led task force that included 125 agents from the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service was formed.[102] The task force grew to more than 150 full-time personnel, but minute analysis of recovered components of the bombs and the investigation into the lives of the victims proved of little use in identifying the suspect, who built the bombs primarily from scrap materials available almost anywhere. Investigators later learned that the victims were chosen indiscriminately from library research.[103]/nIn 1980, chief agent John Douglas, working with agents in the FBI's Behavioral Sciences Unit, issued a psychological profile of the unidentified bomber. It described the offender as a man with above-average intelligence and connections to academia. This profile was later refined to characterize the offender as a neo-Luddite holding an academic degree in the hard sciences, but this psychologically based profile was discarded in 1983. FBI analysts developed an alternative theory that concentrated on the physical evidence in recovered bomb fragments. In this rival profile, the suspect was characterized as a blue-collar airplane mechanic.[104] The UNABOM Task Force set up a toll-free telephone hotline to take calls related to the investigation, with a $1\u00a0million reward for anyone who could provide information leading to the Unabomber's capture.[105]/nBefore the publication of Industrial Society and Its Future, Kaczynski's brother, David, was encouraged by his wife to follow up on suspicions that Ted was the Unabomber.[106] David was dismissive at first, but he took the likelihood more seriously after reading the manifesto a week after it was published in September 1995. He searched through old family papers and found letters dating to the 1970s that Ted had sent to newspapers to protest the abuses of technology using phrasing similar to that in the manifesto.[107]/nBefore the manifesto's publication, the FBI held many press conferences asking the public to help identify the Unabomber. They were convinced that the bomber was from the Chicago area where he began his bombings, had worked in or had some connection to Salt Lake City, and by the 1990s had some association with the San Francisco Bay Area. This geographical information and the wording in excerpts from the manifesto that were released before the entire text of the manifesto was published persuaded David's wife to urge him to read it.[108][109]/nAfter the manifesto was published, the FBI received thousands of tips.[109] While the FBI reviewed new leads, Kaczynski's brother, David, hired private investigator Susan Swanson in Chicago to investigate Ted's activities discreetly.[110] David later hired Washington, D.C., attorney Tony Bisceglie to organize the evidence acquired by Swanson and contact the FBI, given the presumed difficulty of attracting the FBI's attention. Kaczynski's family wanted to protect him from the danger of an FBI raid, such as those at Ruby Ridge or Waco, since they feared a violent outcome from any attempt by the FBI to contact Kaczynski.[111][112]/nIn early 1996, an investigator working with Bisceglie contacted former FBI hostage negotiator and criminal profiler Clinton R. Van Zandt. Bisceglie asked him to compare the manifesto to typewritten copies of handwritten letters David had received from his brother. Van Zandt's initial analysis determined that there was better than a 60 percent chance that the same person had written the manifesto, which had been in public circulation for half a year. Van Zandt's second analytical team determined a higher likelihood. He recommended Bisceglie's client contact the FBI immediately.[111]/nIn February 1996, Bisceglie gave a copy of the 1971 essay written by Kaczynski to Molly Flynn at the FBI.[102] She forwarded the essay to the San Francisco-based task force. FBI profiler James R. Fitzgerald[113][114] recognized similarities in the writings using linguistic analysis and determined that the author of the essays and the manifesto was almost certainly the same person. Combined with facts gleaned from the bombings and Kaczynski's life, the analysis provided the basis for an affidavit signed by Terry Turchie, the head of the entire investigation, in support of the application for a search warrant.[102]/nKaczynski's brother, David, had tried to remain anonymous, but he was soon identified. Within a few days an FBI agent team was dispatched to interview David and his wife with their attorney in Washington, D.C. At this and subsequent meetings, David provided letters written by his brother in their original envelopes, allowing the FBI task force to use the postmark dates to add more detail to their timeline of Ted's activities.[115]/nDavid had once admired and emulated his older brother, but had since left the survivalist lifestyle behind.[116] He had received assurances from the FBI that he would remain anonymous and that his brother would not learn who had turned him in, but his identity was leaked to CBS News in early April 1996. CBS anchorman Dan Rather called FBI director Louis Freeh, who requested 24 hours before CBS broke the story on the evening news. The FBI scrambled to finish the search warrant and have it issued by a federal judge in Montana; afterwards, the FBI conducted an internal leak investigation, but the source of the leak was never identified.[116]/nFBI officials were not unanimous in identifying Ted as the author of the manifesto. The search warrant noted that several experts believed the manifesto had been written by another individual.[48]/nFBI agents arrested an unkempt Kaczynski at his cabin on April 3, 1996. A search revealed a cache of bomb components, 40,000 hand-written journal pages that included bomb-making experiments, descriptions of the Unabomber crimes and one live bomb. They also found what appeared to be the original typed manuscript of Industrial Society and Its Future.[117][118] By this point, the Unabomber had been the target of the most expensive investigation in FBI history at the time.[119][120] A 2000 report by the United States Commission on the Advancement of Federal Law Enforcement stated that the task force had spent over $50\u00a0million throughout the course of the investigation.[121]/nAfter his capture, theories emerged naming Kaczynski as the Zodiac Killer, who murdered five people in Northern California from 1968 to 1969. Among the links that raised suspicion was that Kaczynski lived in the San Francisco Bay Area from 1967 to 1969 (the same period that most of the Zodiac's confirmed killings occurred in California), that both individuals were highly intelligent with an interest in bombs and codes, and that both wrote letters to newspapers demanding the publication of their works with the threat of continued violence if the demand was not met. Additionally, Kaczynski's whereabouts could not be verified for all of the killings. Since the gun and knife murders committed by the Zodiac Killer differed from Kaczynski's bombings, authorities did not pursue him as a suspect. Robert Graysmith, author of the 1986 book Zodiac, said the similarities are \"fascinating\" but purely coincidental.[122]/nAt one point in 1993, investigators sought an individual whose first name was \"Nathan\" because the name was imprinted on the envelope of a letter sent to the media.[57]/nA federal grand jury indicted Kaczynski in June 1996 on ten counts of illegally transporting, mailing, and using bombs.[123] Kaczynski's lawyers, headed by Montana federal public defenders Michael Donahoe and Judy Clarke, attempted to enter an insanity defense to avoid the death penalty, but Kaczynski rejected this strategy. On January\u00a08, 1998, he asked to dismiss his lawyers and hire Tony Serra as his counsel; Serra had agreed not to use an insanity defense and instead promised to base a defense on Kaczynski's anti-technology views.[124][125][126] After this request was unsuccessful, Kaczynski tried to kill himself on January\u00a09.[127] Sally Johnson, the psychiatrist who examined Kaczynski, concluded that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia,[128] though the validity of this diagnosis has been criticized.[129] Forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz said Kaczynski was not psychotic but had a schizoid or schizotypal personality disorder.[130] In his 2010 book Technological Slavery, Kaczynski said that two prison psychologists who visited him frequently for four years told him they saw no indication that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and the diagnosis was \"ridiculous\" and a \"political diagnosis\".[131] Some contemporary authors suggested that multiple people, most notably Kaczynski's brother and mother, purposely spread the image of Kaczynski as mentally ill with the aim to save him from execution.[132]/nOn January\u00a021, 1998, Kaczynski was declared competent to stand trial by federal prison psychiatrist Johnson, \"despite the psychiatric diagnoses\",[133] and prosecutors sought the death penalty. Kaczynski pled guilty to all charges on January\u00a022, 1998, accepting life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. He later tried to withdraw this plea, claiming the judge had coerced him, but Judge Garland Ellis Burrell Jr. denied his request and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld that denial.[134][135]/nIn 2006, Burrell ordered that items from Kaczynski's cabin be sold at a \"reasonably advertised Internet auction\". Items considered to be bomb-making materials, such as diagrams and \"recipes\" for bombs, were excluded. The net proceeds went toward the $15\u00a0million in restitution Burrell had awarded Kaczynski's victims.[136] Kaczynski's correspondence and other personal papers were also auctioned.[137][138][139] Burrell ordered the removal, before sale, of references in those documents to Kaczynski's victims; Kaczynski unsuccessfully challenged those redactions as a violation of his freedom of speech.[140][141][142] The auction ran for two weeks in 2011, and raised over $232,000.[143]/nAlmost immediately after being convicted, Kaczynski began serving his eight life sentences without the possibility of parole at ADX Florence, a supermax prison in Florence, Colorado.[140][144] Early in his imprisonment, Kaczynski befriended Ramzi Yousef and Timothy McVeigh, the perpetrators of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, respectively; they discussed religion and politics and formed a friendship which lasted until McVeigh's execution in 2001.[145] Kaczynski stated about Timothy McVeigh \"On a personal level I like McVeigh and I imagine that most people would like him\", but also stated \"assuming that the Oklahoma City bombing was intended as a protest against the U.S. government in general and against the government\u2019s actions at Waco in particular, I will say that I think the bombing was a bad action because it was unnecessarily inhumane.\"[146]/nIn October 2005, Kaczynski offered to donate two rare books to the Melville J.

The library rejected the offer on the grounds that it already had copies of the works.[147] The Labadie Collection, part of the University of Michigan's Special Collections Library, houses Kaczynski's correspondence with over 400 people since his arrest, including replies, legal documents, publications, and clippings.[148][149] His writings are among the most popular selections in the University of Michigan's special collections.[95] The identity of most correspondents will remain sealed until 2049.[148][150] In 2012, Kaczynski responded to the Harvard Alumni Association's directory inquiry for the fiftieth reunion of the class of 1962; he listed his occupation as \"prisoner\" and his eight life sentences as \"awards\".[151]/nIn 2011, Kaczynski was a person of interest in the Chicago Tylenol murders. Kaczynski was willing to provide a DNA sample to the FBI, but later withheld it as a bargaining chip for his legal efforts against the FBI's private auction of his confiscated property.[152] The U.S. government seized Kaczynski's cabin, which they put on display at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., until late 2019, when it was transferred to a nearby FBI museum.[153][154]/nOn December 14, 2021, the 79-year-old Kaczynski was transferred to the Federal Medical Center, Butner, North Carolina.[155][6]/nAt 12:23 a.m. on June 10, 2023, Kaczynski was found in his cell unresponsive. He was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. Prison officials believe his death to be a suicide. He was also in the late stages of cancer.[5][6]/nKaczynski has been portrayed in and inspired multiple artistic works in the realm of popular culture.[156] These include the 1996 television film Unabomber: The True Story,[157] the 2011 play P.O. Box Unabomber,[158] the 2012 documentary Stemple Pass,[159] Manhunt: Unabomber, the 2017 season of the television series Manhunt,[160] and the 2021 film Ted K.[161] He was portrayed by Sharlto Copley and Paul Bettany in Ted K and Manhunt respectively./nThe moniker \"Unabomber\" was also applied to the Italian Unabomber, a terrorist who conducted attacks similar to Kaczynski's in Italy from 1994 to 2006.[162] Prior to the 1996 United States presidential election, a campaign called \"Unabomber for President\" was launched with the goal of electing Kaczynski as president through write-in votes.[163]/nIn his book The Age of Spiritual Machines (1999), futurist Ray Kurzweil quoted a passage from Kaczynski's manifesto Industrial Society and Its Future.[164] In turn, Kaczynski was referenced by Bill Joy, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, in the 2000 Wired article \"Why the Future Doesn't Need Us\". Joy stated that Kaczynski \"is clearly a Luddite, but simply saying this does not dismiss his argument\".[165][166] Professor Jean-Marie Apostolid\u00e8s has raised questions surrounding the ethics of spreading Kaczynski's views.[167] Various radical movements and extremists have been influenced by Kaczynski.[100] People inspired by Kaczynski's ideas show up in unexpected places, from nihilist, anarchist, and eco-extremist movements to conservative intellectuals.[47] Anders Behring Breivik, the far-right perpetrator of the 2011 Norway attacks,[168] published a manifesto which copied large portions from Industrial Society and Its Future, with certain terms substituted (e.g., replacing \"leftists\" with \"cultural Marxists\" and \"multiculturalists\").[169][170]/nOver twenty years after Kaczynski's imprisonment, his views had inspired an online community of primitivists and neo-Luddites. One explanation for the renewal of interest in his views is the television series Manhunt: Unabomber, which aired in 2017.[171] Kaczynski is also frequently referred to by ecofascists online.[172] Although some militant fascist and neo-Nazi groups idolize him, Kaczynski described fascism in his manifesto as a \"kook ideology\" and Nazism as \"evil\".[171]/nMerrick Garland, who would later serve as United States Attorney General, has cited the Unabomber case as among the most important cases he worked on.[173]", "34383299": "John Shand CMG (22 January 1834 \u2013 30 November 1914) was a New Zealand university professor, educationalist and administrator.

He contributed to the studies of philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, and philosophy of science.[5] Outside philosophy, Putnam contributed to mathematics and computer science. Together with Martin Davis he developed the Davis\u2013Putnam algorithm for the Boolean satisfiability problem[6] and he helped demonstrate the unsolvability of Hilbert's tenth problem.[7]/nPutnam applied equal scrutiny to his own philosophical positions as to those of others, subjecting each position to rigorous analysis until he exposed its flaws.[8] As a result, he acquired a reputation for frequently changing his positions.[9] In philosophy of mind, Putnam argued against the type-identity of mental and physical states based on his hypothesis of the multiple realizability of the mental, and for the concept of functionalism, an influential theory regarding the mind\u2013body problem.[5][10] In philosophy of language, along with Saul Kripke and others, he developed the causal theory of reference, and formulated an original theory of meaning, introducing the notion of semantic externalism based on a thought experiment called Twin Earth.[11]/nIn philosophy of mathematics, Putnam and W. V. O. Quine developed the Quine\u2013Putnam indispensability argument, an argument for the reality of mathematical entities,[12] later espousing the view that mathematics is not purely logical, but \"quasi-empirical\".[13] In epistemology, Putnam criticized the \"brain in a vat\" thought experiment, which appears to provide a powerful argument for epistemological skepticism, by challenging its coherence.[14] In metaphysics, he originally espoused a position called metaphysical realism, but eventually became one of its most outspoken critics, first adopting a view he called \"internal realism\",[15] which he later abandoned. Despite these changes of view, throughout his career Putnam remained committed to scientific realism, roughly the view that mature scientific theories are approximately true descriptions of ways things are.[16]/nIn his later work, Putnam became increasingly interested in American pragmatism, Jewish philosophy, and ethics, engaging with a wider array of philosophical traditions. He also displayed an interest in metaphilosophy, seeking to \"renew philosophy\" from what he identified as narrow and inflated concerns.[17] He was at times a politically controversial figure, especially for his involvement with the Progressive Labor Party in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[18]/nHilary Whitehall Putnam was born on July 31, 1926, in Chicago, Illinois.[19] His father, Samuel Putnam, was a scholar of Romance languages, columnist, and translator who wrote for the Daily Worker, a publication of the American Communist Party, from 1936 to 1946.[20] Because of his father's commitment to communism, Putnam had a secular upbringing, although his mother, Riva, was Jewish.[8] In early 1927, six months after Hilary's birth, the family moved to France, where Samuel was under contract to translate the surviving works of Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais.[17][19] In a 2015 autobiographical essay, Putnam said that his first childhood memories were from his life in France, and his first language was French.[17]/nPutnam completed the first two years of his primary education in France before he and his parents returned to the U.S. in 1933, settling in Philadelphia.[19] There, he attended Central High School, where he met Noam Chomsky, who was a year behind him.[17]:\u200a8\u200a The two remained friends\u2014and often intellectual opponents\u2014for the rest of Putnam's life.[21] Putnam studied philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, receiving his B.A. degree and becoming a member of the Philomathean Society, the country's oldest continually existing collegiate literary society.[8][22] He did graduate work in philosophy at Harvard University[8] and later at UCLA's philosophy department, where he received his Ph.D. in 1951 for his dissertation, The Meaning of the Concept of Probability in Application to Finite Sequences.[2][23] Putnam's dissertation supervisor Hans Reichenbach was a leading figure in logical positivism, the dominant school of philosophy of the day; one of Putnam's most consistent positions was his rejection of logical positivism as self-defeating.[22] Over the course of his life, Putnam was his own philosophical adversary, changing his positions on philosophical questions and critiquing his previous views.[11]/nAfter obtaining his PhD, Putnam taught at Northwestern University (1951\u201352), Princeton University (1953\u201361), and MIT (1961\u201365).

In 1962, he married fellow philosopher Ruth Anna Putnam (born Ruth Anna Jacobs), who took a teaching position in philosophy at Wellesley College.[22][24][25] Rebelling against the antisemitism they experienced during their youth, the Putnams decided to establish a traditional Jewish home for their children.[26] Since they had no experience with the rituals of Judaism, they sought out invitations to other Jewish homes for Seder. They began to study Jewish rituals and Hebrew, became more interested in Judaism, self-identified as Jews, and actively practiced Judaism. In 1994, Hilary celebrated a belated bar mitzvah service; Ruth Anna's bat mitzvah was celebrated four years later.[26]/nIn the 1960s and early 1970s, Putnam was an active supporter of the American Civil Rights Movement and he was also an active opponent of the Vietnam War.[18] In 1963, he organized one of MIT's first faculty and student anti-war committees.[22][24] After moving to Harvard in 1965, he organized campus protests and began teaching courses on Marxism. Putnam became an official faculty advisor to the Students for a Democratic Society and in 1968 a member of the Progressive Labor Party (PLP).[22][24] He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1965.[27] After 1968, his political activities centered on the PLP.[18] The Harvard administration considered these activities disruptive and attempted to censure Putnam.[28][29] Putnam permanently severed his relationship with the PLP in 1972.[30] In 1997, at a meeting of former draft resistance activists at Boston's Arlington Street Church, he called his involvement with the PLP a mistake. He said he had been impressed at first with the PLP's commitment to alliance-building and its willingness to attempt to organize from within the armed forces.[18]/nIn 1976, Putnam was elected president of the American Philosophical Association. The next year, he was selected as Walter Beverly Pearson Professor of Mathematical Logic in recognition of his contributions to the philosophy of logic and mathematics. While breaking with his radical past, Putnam never abandoned his belief that academics have a particular social and ethical responsibility toward society. He continued to be forthright and progressive in his political views, as expressed in the articles \"How Not to Solve Ethical Problems\" (1983) and \"Education for Democracy\" (1993).[22]/nPutnam was a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1999.[31] He retired from teaching in June 2000, becoming Cogan University Professor Emeritus, but as of 2009 continued to give a seminar almost yearly at Tel Aviv University. He also held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the University of Amsterdam in 2001.[32] His corpus includes five volumes of collected works, seven books, and more than 200 articles. Putnam's renewed interest in Judaism inspired him to publish several books and essays on the topic.[33] With his wife, he co-authored several essays and a book on the late-19th-century American pragmatist movement.[22]/nFor his contributions in philosophy and logic, Putnam was awarded the Rolf Schock Prize in 2011[34] and the Nicholas Rescher Prize for Systematic Philosophy in 2015.[35] Putnam died at his home in Arlington, Massachusetts, on March 13, 2016.[36] At the time of his death, Putnam was Cogan University Professor Emeritus at Harvard University./nPutnam's best-known work concerns philosophy of mind. His most noted original contributions to that field came in several key papers published in the late 1960s that set out the hypothesis of multiple realizability.[37] In these papers, Putnam argues that, contrary to the famous claim of the type-identity theory, pain may correspond to utterly different physical states of the nervous system in different organisms even if they all experience the same mental state of \"being in pain\".[37] Putnam cited examples from the animal kingdom to illustrate his thesis. He asked whether it was likely that the brain structures of diverse types of animals realize pain, or other mental states, the same way. If they do not share the same brain structures, they cannot share the same mental states and properties, in which case mental states must be realized by different physical states in different species. Putnam then took his argument a step further, asking about such things as the nervous systems of alien beings, artificially intelligent robots and other silicon-based life forms. These hypothetical entities, he contended, should not be considered incapable of experiencing pain just because they lack human neurochemistry. Putnam concluded that type-identity theorists had been making an \"ambitious\" and \"highly implausible\" conjecture that could be disproved by one example of multiple realizability. This is sometimes called the \"likelihood argument\", as it focuses on the claim that multiple realizability is more likely than type-identity theory.[38][39]:\u200a640/nPutnam also formulated an a priori argument in favor of multiple realizability based on what he called \"functional isomorphism\". He defined the concept in these terms: \"Two systems are functionally isomorphic if 'there is a correspondence between the states of one and the states of the other that preserves functional relations'.\" In the case of computers, two machines are functionally isomorphic if and only if the sequential relations among states in the first exactly mirror the sequential relations among states in the other. Therefore, a computer made of silicon chips and one made of cogs and wheels can be functionally isomorphic but constitutionally diverse. Functional isomorphism implies multiple realizability.[38][39]:\u200a637/nPutnam, Jerry Fodor, and others argued that along with being an effective argument against type-identity theories, multiple realizability implies that any low-level explanation of higher-level mental phenomena is insufficiently abstract and general. Functionalism, which identifies mental kinds with functional kinds that are characterized exclusively in terms of causes and effects, abstracts from the level of microphysics, and therefore seemed to be a better explanation of the relation between mind and body. In fact, there are many functional kinds, including mousetraps and eyes, that are multiply realized at the physical level.[38][40][39]:\u200a648\u2013649\u200a[41]:\u200a6/nMultiple realizability has been criticized on the grounds that, if it were true, research and experimentation in the neurosciences would be impossible.[42] According to William Bechtel and Jennifer Mundale, to be able to conduct such research in the neurosciences, universal consistencies must either exist or be assumed to exist in brain structures. It is the similarity (or homology) of brain structures that allows us to generalize across species.[42] If multiple realizability were an empirical fact, results from experiments conducted on one species of animal (or one organism) would not be meaningful when generalized to explain the behavior of another species (or organism of the same species).[43] Jaegwon Kim, David Lewis, Robert Richardson and Patricia Churchland have also criticized metaphysical realism.[44][45][46][47]/nPutnam himself put forth the first formulation of such a functionalist theory. This formulation, now called \"machine-state functionalism\", was inspired by analogies Putnam and others made between the mind and Turing machines.[48] The point for functionalism is the nature of the states of the Turing machine. Each state can be defined in terms of its relations to the other states and to the inputs and outputs, and the details of how it accomplishes what it accomplishes and of its material constitution are completely irrelevant. According to machine-state functionalism, the nature of a mental state is just like the nature of a Turing machine state. Just as \"state one\" simply is the state in which, given a particular input, such-and-such happens, so being in pain is the state which disposes one to cry \"ouch\", become distracted, wonder what the cause is, and so forth.[49]/nIn the late 1980s, Putnam abandoned his adherence to functionalism and other computational theories of mind. His change of mind was primarily due to the difficulties computational theories have in explaining certain intuitions with respect to the externalism of mental content. This is illustrated by Putnam's own Twin Earth thought experiment (see Philosophy of language).[50][non-primary source needed] In 1988 he also developed a separate argument against functionalism based on Fodor's generalized version of multiple realizability. Asserting that functionalism is really a watered-down identity theory in which mental kinds are identified with functional kinds, Putnam argued that mental kinds may be multiply realizable over functional kinds. The argument for functionalism is that the same mental state could be implemented by the different states of a universal Turing machine.[51][non-primary source needed]/nDespite Putnam's rejection of functionalism, it has continued to flourish and been developed into numerous versions by Fodor, David Marr, Daniel Dennett, and David Lewis, among others.[52] Functionalism helped lay the foundations for modern cognitive science[52] and is the dominant theory of mind in philosophy today.[53]/nBy 2012 Putnam accepted a modification of functionalism called \"liberal functionalism\". The view holds that \"what matters for consciousness and for mental properties generally is the right sort of functional capacities and not the particular matter that subserves those capacities\".[54] The specification of these capacities may refer to what goes on outside the organism's \"brain\", may include intentional idioms, and need not describe a capacity to compute something or other.[54]/nPutnam himself formulated one of the main arguments against functionalism: the Twin Earth thought experiment. But there have been other criticisms. John Searle's Chinese room argument (1980) is a direct attack on the claim that thought can be represented as a set of functions. The thought experiment is designed to show that it is possible to mimic intelligent action with a purely functional system, without any interpretation or understanding. Searle describes a situation in which a person who speaks only English is locked in a room with Chinese symbols in baskets and a rule book in English for moving the symbols around. The person is instructed, by people outside the room, to follow the rule book for sending certain symbols out of the room when given certain symbols. The people outside the room speak Chinese and are communicating with the person inside via the Chinese symbols. According to Searle, it would be absurd to claim that the English speaker inside \"knows\" Chinese based on these syntactic processes alone. This argument attempts to show that systems that operate merely on syntactic processes cannot realize any semantics (meaning) or intentionality (aboutness). Searle thus attacks the idea that thought can be equated with following a set of syntactic rules and concludes that functionalism is an inadequate theory of the mind.[55] Ned Block has advanced several other arguments against functionalism.[56]/nOne of Putnam's contributions to philosophy of language is his semantic externalism, the claim that terms' meanings are determined by factors outside the mind, encapsulated in his slogan that \"meaning just ain't in the head\". His views on meaning, first laid out in Meaning and Reference (1973), then in The Meaning of \"Meaning\" (1975), use his \"Twin Earth\" thought experiment to defend this thesis.[57][58]/nTwin Earth shows this, according to Putnam, since on Twin Earth everything is identical to Earth, except that its lakes, rivers and oceans are filled with XYZ rather than H2O. Consequently, when an earthling, Fredrick, uses the Earth-English word \"water\", it has a different meaning from the Twin Earth-English word \"water\" when used by his physically identical twin, Frodrick, on Twin Earth. Since Fredrick and Frodrick are physically indistinguishable when they utter their respective words, and since their words have different meanings, meaning cannot be determined solely by what is in their heads.[59] This led Putnam to adopt a version of semantic externalism with regard to meaning and mental content.[14][38] The philosopher of mind and language Donald Davidson, despite his many differences of opinion with Putnam, wrote that semantic externalism constituted an \"anti-subjectivist revolution\" in philosophers' way of seeing the world. Since Descartes's time, philosophers had been concerned with proving knowledge from the basis of subjective experience. Thanks to Putnam, Saul Kripke, Tyler Burge and others, Davidson said, philosophy could now take the objective realm for granted and start questioning the alleged \"truths\" of subjective experience.[60]/nAlong with Kripke, Keith Donnellan, and others, Putnam contributed to what is known as the causal theory of reference.[5] In particular, he maintained in The Meaning of \"Meaning\" that the objects referred to by natural kind terms\u2014such as \"tiger\", \"water\", and \"tree\"\u2014are the principal elements of the meaning of such terms. There is a linguistic division of labor, analogous to Adam Smith's economic division of labor, according to which such terms have their references fixed by the \"experts\" in the particular field of science to which the terms belong. So, for example, the reference of the term \"lion\" is fixed by the community of zoologists, the reference of the term \"elm tree\" is fixed by the community of botanists, and chemists fix the reference of the term \"table salt\" as sodium chloride. These referents are considered rigid designators in the Kripkean sense and are disseminated outward to the linguistic community.[38][61]:\u200a33/nPutnam specifies a finite sequence of elements (a vector) for the description of the meaning of every term in the language. Such a vector consists of four components:/nSuch a \"meaning-vector\" provides a description of the reference and use of an expression within a particular linguistic community. It provides the conditions for its correct usage and makes it possible to judge whether a single speaker attributes the appropriate meaning to it or whether its use has changed enough to cause a difference in its meaning. According to Putnam, it is legitimate to speak of a change in the meaning of an expression only if the reference of the term, and not its stereotype, has changed.[17]:\u200a339\u2013340\u200a But since no possible algorithm can determine which aspect\u2014the stereotype or the reference\u2014has changed in a particular case, it is necessary to consider the usage of other expressions of the language.[38][non-primary source needed] Since there is no limit to the number of such expressions to be considered, Putnam embraced a form of semantic holism.[62]/nDespite the many changes in his other positions, Putnam consistently adhered to semantic holism. Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others have identified problems with this position. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression in the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we will never be able to master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same expression, and therefore how any communication is possible between them. Given a sentence P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, P means one thing to Fred and something else to Mary. Moreover, if P derives its meaning from its relations with all the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if one accepts the truth of a sentence and then rejects it later on, the meaning of what one rejected and what one accepted are completely different and therefore one cannot change opinions with regard to the same sentences.[63][page\u00a0needed][64][page\u00a0needed][65][page\u00a0needed]/nIn the philosophy of mathematics, Putnam has utilized indispensability arguments to argue for a realist interpretation of mathematics. In his 1971 book Philosophy of Logic, he presented what has since been called the locus classicus of the Quine\u2013Putnam indispensability argument.[12] The argument, which he attributed to Willard Van Orman Quine, is presented in the book as \"quantification over mathematical entities is indispensable for science, both formal and physical; therefore we should accept such quantification; but this commits us to accepting the existence of the mathematical entities in question.\"[66] According to Charles Parsons, Putnam \"very likely\" endorsed this version of the argument in his early work, but later came to deny some of the views present in it.[67]:\u200a128/nIn 1975, Putnam formulated his own indispensability argument based on the no miracles argument in the philosophy of science, saying, \"I believe that the positive argument for realism [in science] has an analogue in the case of mathematical realism. Here too, I believe, realism is the only philosophy that doesn't make the success of the science a miracle\".[68] According to Putnam, Quine's version of the argument was an argument for the existence of abstract mathematical objects, while Putnam's own argument was simply for a realist interpretation of mathematics, which he believed could be provided by a \"mathematics as modal logic\" interpretation that need not imply the existence of abstract objects.[67]:\u200a61\u201362/nPutnam also held the view that mathematics, like physics and other empirical sciences, uses both strict logical proofs and \"quasi-empirical\" methods.[69]:\u200a150\u200a For example, Fermat's Last Theorem states that for no integer \n\n\n\nn\n>\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n>2}\n\n are there positive integer values of x, y, and z such that \n\n\n\n\nx\n\nn\n\n\n+\n\ny\n\nn\n\n\n=\n\nz\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x^{n}+y^{n}=z^{n}}\n\n. Before Andrew Wiles proved this for all \n\n\n\nn\n>\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n>2}\n\n in 1995,[70] it had been proved for many values of n. These proofs inspired further research in the area, and formed a quasi-empirical consensus for the theorem. Even though such knowledge is more conjectural than a strictly proved theorem, it was still used in developing other mathematical ideas.[13]/nThe Quine\u2013Putnam indispensability argument has been extremely influential in the philosophy of mathematics, inspiring continued debate and development of the argument in contemporary philosophy of mathematics. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, many in the field consider it the best argument for mathematical realism.[12] Prominent counterarguments come from Hartry Field, who argues that mathematics is not indispensable to science, and Penelope Maddy and Elliott Sober, who dispute whether we are committed to mathematical realism even if it is indispensable to science.[12]/nPutnam has contributed to scientific fields not directly related to his work in philosophy.[5] As a mathematician, he contributed to the resolution of Hilbert's tenth problem in mathematics. This problem (now known as Matiyasevich's theorem or the MRDP theorem) was settled by Yuri Matiyasevich in 1970, with a proof that relied heavily on previous research by Putnam, Julia Robinson and Martin Davis.[71]/nIn computability theory, Putnam investigated the structure of the ramified analytical hierarchy, its connection with the constructible hierarchy and its Turing degrees. He showed that there are many levels of the constructible hierarchy that add no subsets of the integers.[72] Later, with his student George Boolos, he showed that the first such \"non-index\" is the ordinal \n\n\n\n\n\u03b2\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\beta _{0}}\n\n of ramified analysis[73] (this is the smallest \n\n\n\n\u03b2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\beta }\n\n such that \n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\u03b2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L_{\\beta }}\n\n is a model of full second-order comprehension). Also, together with a separate paper with his student Richard Boyd and Gustav Hensel, he demonstrated how the Davis\u2013Mostowski\u2013Kleene hyperarithmetical hierarchy of arithmetical degrees can be naturally extended up to \n\n\n\n\n\u03b2\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\beta _{0}}\n\n.[74]/nIn computer science, Putnam is known for the Davis\u2013Putnam algorithm for the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), developed with Martin Davis in 1960.[5] The algorithm finds whether there is a set of true or false values that satisfies a given Boolean expression so that the entire expression becomes true. In 1962, they further refined the algorithm with the help of George Logemann and Donald W. Loveland. It became known as the DPLL algorithm. It is efficient and still forms the basis of most complete SAT solvers.[6]/nIn epistemology, Putnam is known for his argument against skeptical scenarios based on the \"brain in a vat\" thought experiment (a modernized version of Descartes's evil demon hypothesis). The argument is that one cannot coherently suspect that one is a disembodied \"brain in a vat\" placed there by some \"mad scientist\".[14][75]/nThis follows from the causal theory of reference. Words always refer to the kinds of things they were coined to refer to, the kinds of things their user, or the user's ancestors, experienced. So, if some person, Mary, is a \"brain in a vat\", whose every experience is received through wiring and other gadgetry created by the mad scientist, then Mary's idea of a brain does not refer to a real brain, since she and her linguistic community have never encountered such a thing. To her a brain is actually an image fed to her through the wiring. Nor does her idea of a vat refer to a real vat. So if, as a brain in a vat, she says, \"I'm a brain in a vat\", she is actually saying, \"I'm a brain-image in a vat-image\", which is incoherent. On the other hand, if she is not a brain in a vat, then saying that she is a brain in a vat is still incoherent, because she actually means the opposite. This is a form of epistemological externalism: knowledge or justification depends on factors outside the mind and is not solely determined internally.[14][75]/nPutnam has clarified that his real target in this argument was never skepticism, but metaphysical realism, which he thought implied such skeptical scenarios were possible.[76][77] Since realism of this kind assumes the existence of a gap between how one conceives the world and the way the world really is, skeptical scenarios such as this one (or Descartes's evil demon) present a formidable challenge. By arguing that such a scenario is impossible, Putnam attempts to show that this notion of a gap between one's concept of the world and the way it is is absurd. One cannot have a \"God's-eye\" view of reality. One is limited to one's conceptual schemes, and metaphysical realism is therefore false.[78][79]/nPutnam's brain in a vat argument has been criticized.[80] Crispin Wright argues that Putnam's formulation of the brain-in-a-vat scenario is too narrow to refute global skepticism. The possibility that one is a recently disembodied brain in a vat is not undermined by semantic externalism. If a person has lived her entire life outside the vat\u2014speaking the English language and interacting normally with the outside world\u2014prior to her \"envatment\" by a mad scientist, when she wakes up inside the vat, her words and thoughts (e.g., \"tree\" and \"grass\") will still refer to the objects or events in the external world that they referred to before her envatment.[77]/nIn the late 1970s and the 1980s, stimulated by results from mathematical logic and by some of Quine's ideas, Putnam abandoned his long-standing defense of metaphysical realism\u2014the view that the categories and structures of the external world are both causally and ontologically independent of the conceptualizations of the human mind\u2014and adopted a rather different view, which he called \"internal realism\" or \"pragmatic realism\".[81]:\u200a404\u200a[82][83] Internal realism is the view that, although the world may be causally independent of the human mind, the world's structure\u2014its division into kinds, individuals and categories\u2014is a function of the human mind, and hence the world is not ontologically independent. The general idea is influenced by Immanuel Kant's idea of the dependence of our knowledge of the world on the categories of thought.[84]/nAccording to Putnam, the problem with metaphysical realism is that it fails to explain the possibility of reference and truth.[85] According to the metaphysical realist, our concepts and categories refer because they match up in some mysterious manner with the categories, kinds and individuals inherent in the external world. But how is it possible that the world \"carves up\" into certain structures and categories, the mind carves up the world into its own categories and structures, and the two carvings perfectly coincide? The answer must be that the world does not come pre-structured but that the human mind and its conceptual schemes impose structure on it.[79] In Reason, Truth, and History, Putnam identified truth with what he termed \"idealized rational acceptability.\" The theory is that a belief is true if it would be accepted by anyone under ideal epistemic conditions.[15][81]:\u200a\u00a77.1/nNelson Goodman formulated a similar notion in Fact, Fiction and Forecast (1956). \"We have come to think of the actual as one among many possible worlds. We need to repaint that picture. All possible worlds lie within the actual one\", Goodman wrote.[86] Putnam rejected this form of social constructivism, but retained the idea that there can be many correct descriptions of reality. None of these descriptions can be scientifically proven to be the \"one, true\" description of the world. He thus accepted \"conceptual relativity\"\u2014the view that it may be a matter of choice or convention, e.g., whether mereological sums exist, or whether spacetime points are individuals or mere limits.[87][non-primary source needed]/nCurtis Brown has criticized Putnam's internal realism as a disguised form of subjective idealism, in which case it is subject to the traditional arguments against that position. In particular, it falls into the trap of solipsism. That is, if existence depends on experience, as subjective idealism maintains, and if one's consciousness ceased to exist, then the rest of the universe would also cease to exist.[84] In his reply to Simon Blackburn in the volume Reading Putnam, Putnam renounced internal realism[11] because it assumed a \"cognitive interface\" model of the relation between the mind and the world. Under the increasing influence of William James and the pragmatists, he adopted a direct realist view of this relation.[88][89][90]:\u200a23\u201324\u200a Although he abandoned internal realism, Putnam still resisted the idea that any given thing or system of things can be described in exactly one complete and correct way. He came to accept metaphysical realism in a broader sense, rejecting all forms of verificationism and all talk of our \"making\" the world.[91]/nIn the philosophy of perception, Putnam came to endorse direct realism, according to which perceptual experiences directly present one with the external world. He once further held that there are no mental representations, sense data, or other intermediaries between the mind and the world.[50] By 2012, however, he rejected this commitment in favor of \"transactionalism\", a view that accepts both that perceptual experiences are world-involving transactions, and that these transactions are functionally describable (provided that worldly items and intentional states may be referred to in the specification of the function). Such transactions can further involve qualia.[54][92]/nDuring his career, Putnam espoused various positions on the interpretation of quantum mechanics.[93] In the 1960s and 1970s, he contributed to the quantum logic tradition, holding that the way to resolve quantum theory's apparent paradoxes is to modify the logical rules by which propositions' truth values are deduced.[94][95] Putnam's first foray into this topic was \"A Philosopher Looks at Quantum Mechanics\" in 1965, followed by his 1969 essay \"Is Logic Empirical?\". He advanced different versions of quantum logic over the years,[96] and eventually turned away from it in the 1990s, due to critiques by Nancy Cartwright, Michael Redhead, and others.[11]:\u200a265\u2013280\u200a In 2005, he wrote that he rejected the many-worlds interpretation because he could see no way for it to yield meaningful probabilities.[97] He found both de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory and the spontaneous collapse theory of Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber to be promising, yet also dissatisfying, since it was not clear that either could be made fully consistent with special relativity's symmetry requirements.[93]/nIn the mid-1970s, Putnam became increasingly disillusioned with what he perceived as modern analytic philosophy's \"scientism\" and focus on metaphysics over ethics and everyday concerns.[98]:\u200a186\u2013190\u200a He also became convinced by his readings of James and John Dewey that there is no fact\u2013value dichotomy; that is, normative (e.g., ethical and aesthetic) judgments often have a factual basis, while scientific judgments have a normative element.[87][11]:\u200a240\u200a For a time, under Ludwig Wittgenstein's influence, Putnam adopted a pluralist view of philosophy itself and came to view most philosophical problems as no more than conceptual or linguistic confusions philosophers created by using ordinary language out of context.[87][non-primary source needed] A book of articles on pragmatism by Ruth Anna Putnam and Hilary Putnam, Pragmatism as a Way of Life: The Lasting Legacy of William James and John Dewey, edited by David Macarthur, was published in 2017.[99]/nMany of Putnam's last works addressed the concerns of ordinary people, particularly social problems.[100] For example, he wrote about the nature of democracy, social justice and religion. He also discussed J\u00fcrgen Habermas's ideas, and wrote articles influenced by continental philosophy.[22]/nVincent C.

The accepted Aristotelian doctrine at that time was that the speed of a freely falling body is directly proportional to the total weight of the body and inversely proportional to the density of the medium. Benedetti's view was that the speed depends on just the difference between the specific gravity of the body and that of the medium. As opposed to the Aristotelian theory, his theory predicts that two objects of the same material but of different weights would fall at the same speed, and also that objects of different materials in a vacuum would fall at different though finite speeds.[1][4]/nIn a second edition of the Demonstratio (also 1554), he extended this theory to include the effect of the resistance of the medium, which he said was proportional to the cross section or the surface area of the body. Thus two objects of the same material but of different surface areas would only fall at equal speeds in a vacuum. He repeated this version of his theory in his later Diversarum speculationum mathematicarum et physicarum liber (1585). In this work he explains his theory in terms of the then current theory of impetus.[1][4]/nIt is thought that Galileo derived his initial theory of the speed of a freely falling body from his reading of Benedetti's works. Thus the account found in Galileo's De motu, his early work on the science of motion, follows Benedetti's initial theory as described above. It omits the later development which included the resistance of the medium and not just its density. In this early work, Galileo also subscribes to the theory of impetus.[5]/nIn 1562, the Jesuit Jean Taisnier published from the press of Johann Birkmann of Cologne a work entitled Opusculum perpetua memoria dignissimum, de natura magnetis et ejus effectibus, Item de motu continuo.[6]  This is considered a piece of plagiarism, as Taisnier presents, as though his own, the Epistola de magnete of Peter of Maricourt and the second edition of Benedetti's Demonstratio.[7]/nIn a letter to Cipriano de Rore dated from around 1563, Benedetti proposed a new theory of the cause of consonance, arguing that since sound consists of air waves or vibrations, in the more consonant intervals the shorter, more frequent waves concurred with the longer, less frequent waves at regular intervals. In the same letter, he proposed a measure of consonance by taking the product of the numerator and the denominator of a rational interval in lowest terms; this can be considered an early height function. Isaac Beeckman and Marin Mersenne both adopted this theory in the next century. When they sought Descartes' opinion on Benedetti's theory, Descartes declined to judge the goodness of consonances by such a rational method. Descartes argued that the ear prefers one or another according to the musical context rather than because of any concordance of vibrations.[8][page\u00a0needed]/nCenturies later, Hermann von Helmholtz, in Sensations of Tone (1863) suggested that consonance was due to the coincidence of overtones, which was refined by David Cope in the concept of interval strength (1997), suggesting a similar measure (smaller coefficients are more consonant), but a different mechanism (overtones coinciding, rather than the fundamental waves themselves coinciding periodically). James Tenney used the logarithm of Benedetti's measure as his \"harmonic distance\" (1983): \n\n\n\n\nlog\n\n2\n\n\n\u2061\n(\na\nb\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\log _{2}(ab)}\n\n is the harmonic distance for the ratio b/a measured from an arbitrary tonal center 1/1, and corresponds geometrically to the taxicab distance from the origin, where the coordinates are the logarithms of the terms of the ratio.[9]", "22717925": "J\u00e1nos Dezs\u0151 Acz\u00e9l FRSC (Hungarian: [\u02c8\u0252t\u0361se\u02d0l]; 26 December 1924 \u2013 1 January 2020),[1][2] also known as John Aczel,[3] was a Hungarian-Canadian mathematician, who specialized in functional equations and information theory./nAcz\u00e9l earned a doctorate in mathematical analysis from the University of Budapest, and held positions at the University of Cologne, Kossuth University, University of Miskolc, and University of Szeged.[4]  He joined the University of Waterloo faculty in 1965, eventually becoming Distinguished Professor in the Department of Pure Mathematics.[5]/nHe was the founder of the journal Aequationes Mathematicae, first published in 1968, and remained its honorary editor-in-chief.[6]/nAcz\u00e9l held honorary degrees from the University of Karlsruhe, the University of Graz, and the University of Silesia in Katowice.[4]\nIn 1971, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.[7] He was the 1988 winner of the Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal Medal.[4] In 1990, he became an external member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences,[1] and, in 2004, he was honored by the academy as one of the \"big five\" most distinguished Hungarian mathematicians.

He entered Magdalene College, Cambridge as a sizar and became Senior wrangler in 1757. He was elected a Fellow of Magdalene and in 1760 Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, holding the chair until his death. He made the assertion known as Waring's problem without proof in his writings Meditationes Algebraicae. Waring was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1763 and awarded the Copley Medal in 1784./nWaring was the eldest son of John and Elizabeth Waring, a prosperous farming couple. He received his early education in Shrewsbury School under a Mr Hotchkin and was admitted as a sizar at Magdalene College, Cambridge, on 24 March 1753, being also Millington exhibitioner.[1]/nHis extraordinary talent for mathematics was recognised from his early years in Cambridge. In 1757 he graduated BA as senior wrangler and on 24 April 1758 was elected to a fellowship at Magdalene.[1] He belonged to the Hyson Club, whose members included William Paley./nAt the end of 1759 Waring published the first chapter of Miscellanea Analytica. On 28 January the next year he was appointed Lucasian professor of mathematics, one of the highest positions in Cambridge. William Samuel Powell, then tutor in St John's College, Cambridge opposed Waring's election and instead supported the candidacy of William Ludlam. In the polemic with Powell, Waring was backed by John Wilson. In fact Waring was very young and did not hold the MA, necessary for qualifying for the Lucasian chair, but this was granted him in 1760 by royal mandate. In 1762 he published the full Miscellanea Analytica, mainly devoted to the theory of numbers and algebraic equations. In 1763 he was elected to the Royal Society. He was awarded its Copley Medal in 1784 but withdrew from the society in 1795, after he had reached sixty, 'on account of [his] age'. Waring was also a member of the academies of sciences of G\u00f6ttingen and Bologna. In 1767 he took an MD degree, but his activity in medicine was quite limited. He carried out dissections with Richard Watson, professor of chemistry and later bishop of Llandaff. From about 1770 he was physician at Addenbrooke's Hospital at Cambridge, and he also practised at St Ives, Huntingdonshire, where he lived for some years after 1767. His career as a physician was not very successful since he was seriously short-sighted and a very shy man./nWaring had a younger brother, Humphrey, who obtained a fellowship at Magdalene in 1775. In 1776 Waring married Mary Oswell, sister of a draper in Shrewsbury;[1] they moved to Shrewsbury and then retired to Plealey, 8 miles out of the town, where Waring owned an estate of 215 acres in 1797[2]/nWaring wrote a number of papers in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, dealing with the resolution of algebraic equations, number theory, series, approximation of roots, interpolation, the geometry of conic sections, and dynamics. The Meditationes Algebraicae (1770), where many of the results published in Miscellanea Analytica were reworked and expanded, was described by Joseph-Louis Lagrange as 'a work full of excellent researches'. In this work Waring published many theorems concerning the solution of algebraic equations which attracted the attention of continental mathematicians, but his best results are in number theory. Included in this work was the so-called Goldbach conjecture (every even integer is the sum of two primes), and also the following conjecture: every odd integer is a prime or the sum of three primes. Lagrange had proved that every positive integer is the sum of not more than four squares; Waring suggested that every positive integer is either a cube or the sum of not more than nine cubes. He also advanced the hypothesis that every positive integer is either a biquadrate (fourth power) or the sum of not more than nineteen biquadrates. These hypotheses form what is known as Waring's problem. He also published a theorem, due to his friend John Wilson, concerning prime numbers; it was later proven rigorously by Lagrange./nIn Proprietates Algebraicarum Curvarum (1772) Waring reissued in a much revised form the first four chapters of the second part of Miscellanea Analytica. He devoted himself to the classification of higher plane curves, improving results obtained by Isaac Newton, James Stirling, Leonhard Euler, and Gabriel Cramer. In 1794 he published a few copies of a philosophical work entitled An Essay on the Principles of Human Knowledge, which were circulated among his friends./nWaring's mathematical style is highly analytical. In fact he criticised those British mathematicians who adhered too strictly to geometry. It is indicative that he was one of the subscribers of John Landen's Residual Analysis (1764), one of the works in which the tradition of the Newtonian fluxional calculus was more severely criticised. In the preface of Meditationes Analyticae Waring showed a good knowledge of continental mathematicians such as Alexis Clairaut, Jean le Rond d'Alembert, and Euler. He lamented the fact that in Great Britain mathematics was cultivated with less interest than on the continent, and clearly desired to be considered as highly as the great names in continental mathematics\u2014there is no doubt that he was reading their work at a level never reached by any other eighteenth-century British mathematician. Most notably, at the end of chapter three of Meditationes Analyticae Waring presents some partial fluxional equations (partial differential equations in Leibnizian terminology); such equations are a mathematical instrument of great importance in the study of continuous bodies which was almost completely neglected in Britain before Waring's researches. One of the most interesting results in Meditationes Analyticae is a test for the convergence of series generally attributed to d'Alembert (the 'ratio test'). The theory of convergence of series (the object of which is to establish when the summation of an infinite number of terms can be said to have a finite 'sum') was not much advanced in the eighteenth century./nWaring's work was known both in Britain and on the continent, but it is difficult to evaluate his impact on the development of mathematics. His work on algebraic equations contained in Miscellanea Analytica was translated into Italian by Vincenzo Riccati in 1770. Waring's style is not systematic and his exposition is often obscure. It seems that he never lectured and did not habitually correspond with other mathematicians. After J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalande in 1796 observed, in Notice sur la vie de Condorcet, that in 1764 there was not a single first-rate analyst in England, Waring's reply, published after his death as 'Original letter of Dr Waring' in the Monthly Magazine, stated that he had given 'somewhere between three and four hundred new propositions of one kind or another'./nDuring his last years he sank into a deep religious melancholy, and a violent cold caused his death, in Plealey, on 15 August 1798.[1] He was buried in the churchyard at Fitz, Shropshire.", "41526781": "Serafino Raffaele Minich or Serafin Rafael Mini\u0107 (8 December 1808 \u2013 29 May 1883) was a Croatian-Italian mathematician.[1]/nMini\u0107 was born in Venice.

He was given title of Sawai by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb before the siege of Khelna Fort in Deccan. \"Sawai\" means one and a quarter times superior to his contemporaries. He received title of  Maharajah Sawai, Raj Rajeshwar, Shri Rajadhiraj in the year 1723, This was in addition to title of Saramad-i-Raja-i-Hindustan conferred on him on 21 April 1721[1][5]/nIn the later part of his life, Jai Singh broke free from the Mughal hegemony, and to assert his sovereignty, performed the Ashvamedha sacrifice, an ancient rite that had been abandoned for several centuries.[6][7] He moved his kingdom's capital from the town of Amber to the newly-established city of Jaipur in 1727, and performed two Ashwamedha sacrifices, one in 1734, and again in 1741.[8]/nSawai Jai Singh II had a great interest in mathematics, architecture and astronomy. He commissioned the Jantar Mantar observatories at multiple places in India, including his capital Jaipur.[9] He had Euclid's \"Elements of Geometry\" translated into Sanskrit.[10]/nWhen Jai Singh acceded to the ancestral throne at Amber, he had barely enough resources to pay for the support of 1000 cavalry.This abysmal situation had arisen during the previous 96 years, coinciding with the reign of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. The Jaipur kings had always preferred diplomacy over arms in their dealings with the Mughals, since their kingdom was located so close to the Mughal power centers of Delhi and Agra./nSix months after his accession, Jai Singh was ordered by Aurangzeb to serve in the Deccan Wars. But there was a delay of about one year in his responding to the call. One of the reason for this was that he was ordered to recruit a large force, in excess of the contingent required by his mansab. He also had to conclude his marriage with the daughter of Udit Singh, the nephew of Raja Uttam Ram Gaur of Sheopur in March, 1701. Jai Singh reached Burhanpur on 3 August 1701 but he could not proceed further due to heavy rains. On 13 September 1701 an additional cut in his rank (by 500) and pay was made.[11] His feat of arms at the siege of Khelna (1702) was rewarded by the mere restoration of his earlier rank and the title of Sawai (Sawai-meaning one and a quarter, i.e. more capable than one man). When Aurangzeb's grandson Bidar Bakht deputed Sawai Jai Singh to govern the province of Malwa (1704), Aurangzeb angrily revoked this appointment as jaiz nist (invalid)./nThe death of Aurangzeb (1707) at first only increased Jai Singh's troubles. His patrons Bidar Bakht and his father Azam were on the losing side in the Mughal war of succession. Sawai Jai Singh formed an alliance with the Rajput states of Mewar (matrimonially) and Marwar, which were done to form an alliance against Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah I. Zulfiqar Khan appointed Jai Singh to govern the important provinces of Agra and Malwa. In Agra he came into conflict with the sturdy Jat peasantry./nThe Kachwaha ruler was appointed to govern Malwa three times between 1714 and 1737. In Jai Singh's first viceroyalty (subahdar) of Malwa (1714\u20131717), isolated Maratha war-bands that entered the province from the south (Deccan) were constantly defeated and repulsed by Jai Singh.\nIn 1728, Peshwa Baji Rao defeated the Nizam of Hyderabad, part of the Mughal Deccan (treaty of Sheogaon, February 1728). With an agreement from Baji Rao to spare the Nizam's own domains, the Nizam allowed the Marathas a free passage through Berar and Khandesh, the gateway into Hindustan. The Marathas were then able to plant a permanent camp beyond the southern frontier of Malwa.  Following the victory of the Peshwa's brother, Chimaji Appa, over the governor of Malwa Girdhar Bahadur on 29 November 1728, the Marathas were able to convulse much of the country beyond the Southern borders of the Narmada./nUpon Jai Singh's second appointment to Malwa (1729\u20131730), as a far-sighted statesmen, Jai Singh was able to perceive a complete change in the political situation, during the twelve years which had passed since his first viceroyalty there. Imperial power had by then been crippled by the rebellion of the Nizam of Hyderabad as well as the ability of Peshwa Baji Rao to stabilize the internal situation of the Marathas, which resulted in their occupation of Gujarat and an immense increase of their forces.\nNonetheless, in the name of the friendship between their royal ancestors, Jai Singh II, was able to appeal to Shahu to restore to the imperialist, the great fortress of Mandu which the Marathas had occupied a few weeks earlier (order date 19 March 1730). By May, Jai Singh was recalled back to Rajputana to attend more pressing matters, which thus resulted in his two years disassociation from Malwa./nIn 1732, Jai Singh was for the last time, appointed Subahdar of Malwa (1732\u20131737), during which time he advocated Muhammad Shah, to compromise with the Marathas under Shahu, whom greatly remembered the kindness and relationship between the late Jai Singh I and his own grandfather, Shivaji.\nFor this sensible advice, coupled with anti-Jai Singh rhetoric at the Mughal court at Delhi, as well as Muhammad Shah's inability to assert his own will, Jai Singh was removed from his post while the Mughals decided on war.  In this regard, Jai Singh II was practically the last subahdar of Malwa, as Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah, who replaced him in 1737, met with most discomfiting failure at the hands of the Peshwa, resulting with the ceding of the whole of Malwa to the Marathas (Treaty of Duraha, Saturday 7 January 1738).[12][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]/nExploiting the weakening of the Mughal state, the Persian raider Nadir Shah defeated the Mughals at Karnal (13 February 1739) and finally sacked Delhi (11 March, same year). Through this period of turmoil Jai Singh remained in his own state\u2014but he was not idle. Foreseeing the troubled time ahead, Jai Singh II, initiated a program of extensive fortification within the thikanas under Jaipur, to this date, most of the later fortifications around the former Jaipur state, are attributed to the reign of Jai Singh II./nJai Singh increased the size of his ancestral kingdom by annexing lands from the Mughals and rebel chieftains\u2014sometimes by paying money and sometimes through war. The most substantial acquisition was of Shekhawati, which also gave Jai Singh the most able recruits for his fast expanding army.[13]/nAccording to an estimate by Jadunath Sarkar; Jai Singh's regular army did not exceed 40,000 men, which would have cost about 60 lakhs a year, but his strength lay in the large number of artillery and copious supply of munitions which he was careful to maintain and his rule of arming his foot with matchlocks instead of the traditional Rajput sword and shield - He had the wisdom to recognize early the change which firearms had introduced in Indian warfare and to prepare for himself for the new war by raising the fire-power of his army to the maximum, he thus anticipated the success of later Indian rulers like Mirza Najaf Khan, Mahadji Sindhia and Tipu Sultan. Jai Singh's experimental weapon, the Jaivana which he created prior to the shift of his capital to Jaipur, remains the largest wheeled cannon in the world. In 1732, Jai Singh, as governor of Malwa undertook, to maintain 30,000 soldiers, in equal proportions of horsemen and foot-musketeers. These did not include his contingents in the Subahs of Agra and Ajmer and in his own dominions and fort garrisons./nThe armed strength of Jai Singh had always made him, the most formidable ruler in Northern India and all the other Rajas looked up to him for protection and the promotion of their interests at the Imperial court. The fast-spreading Maratha dominion and their raids into the north had caused alarm among the Rajput chiefs\u2014Jai Singh called a conference of Rajput rulers at Hurda (1734) to deal with this peril but nothing came of this meeting. In 1736 Peshwa Baji Rao imposed tribute on the Kingdom of Mewar. To thwart further Maratha domination Sawai Jai Singh planned a local hegemony, to form under the leadership of Jaipur, a political union in Rajputana. He first annexed Bundi and Rampura in the Malwa plateau, made a matrimonial alliance with Mewar, and intervened in the affairs of the Rathors of Bikaner and Jodhpur. These half-successful attempts only stiffened the backs of the other Rajput clans who turned to the very same Marathas for aid, and consequently hastened their domination over Rajasthan. Jai Singh's ambitions in Rajputana failed after the Battle of Gangwana./nBattle of Gangwana was the last destructive battle fought by Jai Singh as he could never recover from the shock and died two years later in 1743. Madho Singh later avenged his father by poisoning Bakht Singh of Marwar. (Jai Singh was cremated at the Royal Crematorium at Gaitore in the north of Jaipur) he was succeeded by his less capable son Ishwari Singh.[14][15]/nJai Singh was the first Hindu ruler in centuries to perform the ancient Vedic ceremonies like the Ashwamedha (1716)[16] sacrifices \u2014 and the Vajapeya (1734) on both occasions vast amounts were distributed in charity. Being initiated in the Nimbarka Sampradaya of the Vaishnava sect, he also promoted Sanskrit learning and initiated reforms in Hindu society like the abolition of Sati and curbing the wasteful expenditures in Rajput weddings. It was at Jai Singh's insistence that the hated jaziya tax, imposed on the Hindu population by Aurangzeb (1679), was finally abolished by the Emperor Muhammad Shah in 1720. In 1728 Jai Singh prevailed on him to also withdraw the pilgrimage tax on Hindus at Gaya.[citation needed]/nIn 1719, he was witness to a noisy discussion in the court of Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah. The heated debate regarded how to make astronomical calculations to determine an auspicious date when the emperor could start a journey. This discussion led Jai Singh to think that the nation needed to be educated on the subject of astronomy.  His interest may have been kindled as early as 1702 by his tutor Jagannatha Samrat. Despite local wars, foreign invasions, and consequent turmoil, Jai Singh found time and energy to build astronomical observatories.[17]/nFive observatories were built at Delhi, Mathura (in his Agra province), Benares, Ujjain (capital of his Malwa province), and his own capital of Jaipur. His astronomical observations were remarkably accurate. He drew up a set of tables, entitled Zij-i-Muhammadshahi, to enable people to make astronomical observations. He had Euclid's \"Elements of Geometry\" translated into Sanskrit as also several works on trigonometry, and Napier's work on the construction and use of logarithms.[18] Relying primarily on Indian astronomy, these buildings were used to accurately predict eclipses and other astronomical events. The observational techniques and instruments used in his observatories were also superior to those used by the European Jesuit astronomers he invited to his observatories.[19][20] Termed as the Jantar Mantar they consisted of the Ram Yantra (a cylindrical building with an open top and a pillar in its center), the Jai Prakash (a concave hemisphere), the Samrat Yantra (a huge equinoctial dial), the Digamsha Yantra (a pillar surrounded by two circular walls), and the Narivalaya Yantra (a cylindrical dial)./nThe Samrat Yantra is a huge sundial. It can be used to estimate the local time, to locate the Pole Star, and to measure the declination of celestial objects. The Rama Yantra can be used to measure the altitude and azimuth of celestial objects. The Shanku Yantra can be used to measure the latitude of the place.[18]/nJai Singh's greatest achievement was the construction of Jaipur city (known originally as Jainagara[citation needed] (in Sanskrit, as the 'city of victory' and later as the 'pink city' by the British by the early 20th century), the planned city, later became the capital as the Indian state of Rajasthan. Construction of the new capital began as early as 1725 although it was in 1727 that the foundation stone was ceremonially laid, and by 1733 Jaipur officially replaced Amber as the capital of the Kachawahas. Built on the ancient Hindu grid pattern, found in the archaeological ruins of 3000 BCE, it was designed by Vidyadhar Bhattacharya who was educated in the ancient Sanskrit manuals (silpa-sutras) on city-planning and architecture. Merchants from all over India settled down in the relative safety of this rich city, protected by thick walls, and a garrison of 17,000 supported by adequate artillery. A Sanskrit epic by the name 'Ishvar Vilas Mahakavya' written by Kavikalanidhi Devarshi Shrikrishna Bhatt gives a good historical description of various important events of that era, including the construction of Jaipur city.[21]/nJai Singh also translated works by people like John Napier. For these multiple achievements, Jai Singh II is remembered as the most enlightened king of 18th-century India even to this date. These days Jai Singh's observatories at Jaipur, Varanasi, and Ujjain are functional. Only the one at Delhi is not functional and the one at Mathura disappeared a long time ago.[22]", "53847553": "William \"Bill\" Yslas V\u00e9lez is an American mathematician, a current Emeritus Professor at the University of Arizona, and an Elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.[1] From 1992\u201396, V\u00e9lez served as the president of Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS).[2]/nAt the University of Arizona he graduated with B.Sc. in 1968, M.Sc. in 1972, and Ph.D. in 1975.

Her parents were both physicians. Her mother, Florica Bagdasar (n\u00e9e Ciumetti), was a child psychiatrist. Her father, Dumitru Bagdasar\u00a0[ro], was a neurosurgeon. She received her M.S. in mathematics from the University of Bucharest in 1957, where she met and married her first husband, mathematician Cassius Ionescu-Tulcea. She accompanied her husband to the United States in 1957 and received her Ph.D. from Yale University in 1959 under the direction of Shizuo Kakutani with thesis Ergodic Theory of Random Series.[1] After receiving her degree, she worked as a research associate at Yale from 1959 until 1961, and as an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania from 1962 to 1964. From 1964 until 1967 she was an associate professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign. In 1967 she moved to Northwestern University as a Professor of Mathematics. She was at Northwestern until her retirement in 1996, when she became Professor Emeritus./nDuring her marriage to Cassius Ionescu-Tulcea (1956\u20131969), she and her husband co-wrote many papers and a research monograph on lifting theory./nAlexandra's second husband was the writer Saul Bellow, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1976, during their marriage (1975\u20131985). Alexandra features in Bellow's writings; she is portrayed lovingly in his memoir To Jerusalem and Back (1976), and, his novel The Dean's December (1982), more critically, satirically in his last novel,  Ravelstein (2000), which was written many years after their divorce.[2][3] The decade of the nineties was for Alexandra a period of personal and professional fulfillment, brought about by her marriage in 1989 to the mathematician Alberto P. Calder\u00f3n./nSome of her early work involved properties and consequences of lifting. Lifting theory, which had started with the pioneering papers of John von Neumann and later Dorothy Maharam, came into its own in the 1960s and 1970s with the work of the Ionescu Tulceas and provided the definitive treatment for the representation theory of linear operators arising in probability, the process of disintegration of measures. Their Ergebnisse monograph from 1969[4] became a standard reference in this area./nBy applying a lifting to a stochastic process, the Ionescu Tulceas obtained a \u2018separable\u2019 process; this gives a rapid proof of Joseph Leo Doob's theorem concerning the existence of a separable modification of a stochastic process (also a \u2018canonical\u2019 way of obtaining the separable modification).[5] Furthermore, by applying a lifting to a \u2018weakly\u2019 measurable function with values in a weakly compact set of a Banach space, one obtains a strongly measurable function; this gives a one line proof of Phillips's classical theorem (also a \u2018canonical\u2019 way of obtaining the strongly measurable version).[6][7]/nWe say that a set H of measurable functions satisfies the \"separation property\" if any two distinct functions in H belong to distinct equivalence classes. The range of a lifting is always a set of measurable functions with the \"separation property\". The following \u2018metrization criterion\u2019 gives some idea why the functions in the range of a lifting are so much better behaved.  Let H be a set of measurable functions with the following properties: (I) H is compact (for the topology of pointwise convergence); (II) H is convex; (III) H satisfies the \"separation property\". Then H is metrizable.[7][8] The proof of the existence of a lifting commuting with the left translations of an arbitrary locally compact group, by the Ionescu Tulceas, is highly non-trivial; it makes use of approximation by Lie groups, and martingale-type arguments tailored to the group structure.[9]/nIn the early 1960s she worked with C. Ionescu Tulcea on martingales taking values in a Banach space.[10] In a certain sense, this work launched the study of vector-valued martingales, with the first proof of the \u2018strong\u2019 almost everywhere convergence for martingales taking values in a Banach space with (what later became known as) the Radon\u2013Nikodym property; this, by the way, opened the doors to a new area of analysis, the \"geometry of Banach spaces\". These ideas were later extended by Bellow to the theory of \u2018uniform amarts\u2019,[11] (in the context of Banach spaces, uniform amarts are the natural generalization of martingales, quasi-martingales and possess remarkable stability properties, such as optional sampling), now an important chapter in probability theory./nIn 1960 Donald Samuel Ornstein constructed an example of a non-singular transformation on the Lebesgue space of the unit interval, which does not admit a \n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\sigma }\n\n\u2013finite invariant measure equivalent to Lebesgue measure, thus solving a long-standing problem in ergodic theory. A few years later, Rafael V. Chac\u00f3n gave an example of a positive (linear) isometry of \n\n\n\n\nL\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L_{1}}\n\n for which the individual ergodic theorem fails in \n\n\n\n\nL\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L_{1}}\n\n. Her work[12] unifies and extends these two remarkable results. It shows, by methods of Baire category, that the seemingly isolated examples of non-singular transformations first discovered by Ornstein and later by Chac\u00f3n, were in fact the typical case./nBeginning in the early 1980s Bellow began a series of papers that brought about a revival of that area of ergodic theory dealing with limit theorems and the delicate question of pointwise a.e. convergence. This was accomplished by exploiting the interplay with probability and harmonic analysis, in the modern context (the Central limit theorem, transference principles, square functions and other singular integral techniques are now part of the daily arsenal of people working in this area of ergodic theory) and by attracting a number of talented mathematicians who were very active in this area. One of the two problems that she raised at the Oberwolfach meeting on \"Measure Theory\" in 1981,[13] was the question of the validity, for \n\n\n\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f}\n\n in \n\n\n\n\nL\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L_{1}}\n\n, of the pointwise ergodic theorem along the \u2018sequence of squares\u2019, and along the \u2018sequence of primes\u2019 (A similar question was raised independently, a year later, by Hillel Furstenberg). This problem was solved several years later by Jean Bourgain, for \n\n\n\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f}\n\n in \n\n\n\n\nL\n\np\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L_{p}}\n\n, \n\n\n\np\n>\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p>1}\n\n in the case of the \"squares\", and for \n\n\n\np\n>\n(\n1\n+\n\n\n3\n\n\n)\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p>(1+{\\sqrt {3}})/2}\n\n in the case of the \"primes\"  (the argument was pushed through to \n\n\n\np\n>\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p>1}\n\n by M\u00e1t\u00e9 Wierdl; the case of \n\n\n\n\nL\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L_{1}}\n\n however has remained open). Bourgain was awarded the Fields Medal in 1994, in part for this work in ergodic theory./nIt was Ulrich Krengel who first gave, in 1971, an ingenious construction of an increasing sequence of positive integers along which the pointwise ergodic theorem fails in \n\n\n\n\nL\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L_{1}}\n\n for every ergodic transformation. The existence of such a \"bad universal sequence\" came as a surprise. Bellow showed[14] that every lacunary sequence of integers is in fact a \"bad universal sequence\" in  \n\n\n\n\nL\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L_{1}}\n\n. Thus lacunary sequences are \u2018canonical\u2019 examples of \"bad universal sequences\". Later she was able to show[15] that from the point of view of the pointwise ergodic theorem, a sequence of positive integers may be \"good universal\" in \n\n\n\n\nL\n\np\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L_{p}}\n\n, but \"bad universal\" in \n\n\n\n\nL\n\nq\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L_{q}}\n\n, for all \n\n\n\n1\n\u2264\nq\n<\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1\\leq q<p}\n\n. This was rather surprising and answered a question raised by Roger Jones./nA place in this area of research is occupied by the \"strong sweeping out property\" (that a sequence of linear operators may exhibit). This describes the situation when almost everywhere convergence breaks down even in \n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\u221e\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L_{\\infty }}\n\n and in the worst possible way. Instances of this appear in several of her papers. The \"strong sweeping out property\" plays an important role in this area of research. Bellow and her collaborators did an extensive and systematic study of this notion, giving various criteria and numerous examples of the strong sweeping out property.[16] Working with Krengel, she was able[17] to give a negative answer to a long-standing conjecture of Eberhard Hopf. Later, Bellow and Krengel[18] working with Calder\u00f3n were able to show that in fact the Hopf operators have the \"strong sweeping out\" property./nIn the study of aperiodic flows, sampling at nearly periodic times, as for example, \n\n\n\n\nt\n\nn\n\n\n=\nn\n+\n\u03b5\n(\nn\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t_{n}=n+\\varepsilon (n)}\n\n, where \n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\varepsilon }\n\n is positive and tends to zero, does not lead to a.e. convergence; in fact strong sweeping out occurs.[19] This shows the possibility of serious errors when using the ergodic theorem for the study of physical systems. Such results can be of practical value for statisticians and other scientists. In the study of discrete ergodic systems, which can be observed only over certain blocks of time, one has the following dichotomy of behavior of the corresponding averages: either the averages converge a.e. for all functions in \n\n\n\n\nL\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L_{1}}\n\n, or the strong sweeping out property holds. This depends on the geometric properties of the blocks.[20]/nSeveral mathematicians (including Bourgain) worked on problems posed by Bellow and answered those questions in their papers.[21][22][23]", "59778570": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Papy-Lenger (August 12, 1921 \u2013 January 9, 2005) was a Belgian mathematician and mathematics educator active in the New Math movement of the 1960s and 1970s./nFr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Lenger was born on August 12, 1921, in Arlon, Belgium, one of three daughters of a lawyer.

The film stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing, who decrypted German intelligence messages for the British government during World War II. Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Rory Kinnear, Charles Dance, and Mark Strong appear in supporting roles./nThe Imitation Game was released theatrically in the United States on November 28, 2014.

It received eight nominations at the 87th Academy Awards, winning for Best Adapted Screenplay; five nominations at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards; and three nominations at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards. It also received nine BAFTA nominations, and won the People's Choice Award at the 39th Toronto International Film Festival./nIn 1951, two policemen, Nock and Staehl, investigate the mathematician Alan Turing after an apparent break-in at his home. During his interrogation by Nock, Turing tells of his time working at Bletchley Park during the Second World War./nIn 1928, the young Turing is unhappy and bullied at boarding school. He develops a friendship with Christopher Morcom, who sparks his interest in cryptography. Turing develops romantic feelings for him, but Christopher soon dies from tuberculosis./nWhen Britain declares war on Germany in 1939, Turing travels to Bletchley Park. Under the direction of Commander Alastair Denniston, he joins the cryptography team of Hugh Alexander, John Cairncross, Peter Hilton, Keith Furman, and Charles Richards. The team is trying to analyze the Enigma machine, which the Nazis use to send coded messages./nTuring is difficult to work with, and considers his colleagues inferior; he works alone to design a machine to decipher Enigma messages. After Denniston refuses to fund the construction of the machine, Turing writes to Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who puts Turing in charge of the team and funds the machine. Turing fires Furman and Richards and places a difficult crossword in newspapers to find replacements. Joan Clarke, a Cambridge graduate, passes Turing's test but her parents will not allow her to work with the male cryptographers. Turing arranges for her to live and work with the female clerks who intercept the messages and shares his plans with her.  With Clarke's help, Turing warms to the other colleagues, who begin to respect him./nTuring's machine, which he names Christopher, is constructed, but cannot determine the Enigma encryption settings quickly enough; the Germans reset them each day. Denniston orders it to be destroyed and Turing fired, but the other cryptographers threaten to leave if Turing goes. After Clarke plans to leave on the wishes of her parents, Turing proposes marriage, which she accepts. During their engagement party, Turing confirms his homosexuality to Cairncross, who warns him to keep it secret. After overhearing a conversation with a female clerk about messages she receives from the same German coder, Turing has an epiphany, realising he can program the machine to decode words he already knows exist in certain messages. One German coder always opens his first message with a standard plaintext German script. That reveals enough of the day's Enigma code that Christopher can quickly decode all the day's messages. After he recalibrates the machine, it quickly decodes a message and the cryptographers celebrate./nThey learn a convoy is about to be attacked, but Turing realises that if they suddenly reroute the convoy and attack the U-boats, the Germans will realize Enigma is compromised and change the machinery. Therefore, the team at Bletchley Park cannot act on every decoded message and choose not to save the convoy, despite desperate pleas from Peter, whose brother is a sailor serving on one of the ships. Turing creates a statistical model to indicate which warnings to send to maximize destruction and minimize discovery./nTuring discovers that Cairncross is a Soviet spy. When Turing confronts him, Cairncross argues that the Soviets are allies working for the same goals, and threatens to retaliate by disclosing Turing's sexuality. When the top MI6 agent Stewart Menzies appears to threaten Clarke, Turing reveals that Cairncross is a spy. Menzies reveals he knew this already and planted the messages Cairncross leaks to the Soviets for British benefit. Fearing for her safety, Turing tells Clarke to leave Bletchley Park, revealing that he is a homosexual. Clarke states she always suspected but insists they would have been happy together anyway. Turing then tells her he never cared for her, and only used her for her cryptography skills. Heartbroken, she decides to stay anyway, deeming this the single most important task she will undertake, and she now refuses to cow to what Turing or her parents want her to do, or think of her decisions.  After the war, Menzies tells the cryptographers to destroy their work, because MI6 wants governments to think they had unbreakable code machines. He tells the team that they should never see one another again or share what they have done./nIn 1952, Turing is convicted of gross indecency and, in lieu of a prison sentence, undergoes chemical castration so he can continue his work. Clarke visits him in his home and witnesses his physical and mental deterioration. She comforts him by saying that his work saved millions of lives./nThe epilogue reveals that after a year of government-mandated hormonal therapy, Turing died by suicide on 7 June 1954. In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a posthumous Royal Pardon, honouring his work which would eventually go on to create the modern computer./nBefore Cumberbatch joined the project, Warner Bros. bought the screenplay for a reported seven-figure sum because of Leonardo DiCaprio's interest in playing Turing.[6][7][8][9][10] In the end, DiCaprio did not come on board and the rights of the script reverted to the screenwriter. Black Bear Pictures subsequently committed to finance the film for $14 million.[4][11][12] Various directors were attached during development including Ron Howard and David Yates.[13] In December 2012, it was announced that Headhunters director Morten Tyldum would helm the project, making the film his English-language directorial debut.[14][15]/nPrincipal photography began on September 15, 2013, in Britain. Filming locations included Turing's former school, Sherborne, Bletchley Park, where Turing and his colleagues worked during the war, and Central Saint Martins campus on Southampton Row in London.[16] Other locations included towns in England such as Nettlebed (Joyce Grove in Oxfordshire) and Chesham (Buckinghamshire). Scenes were also filmed at Bicester Airfield and outside the Law Society building in Chancery Lane, and at West London Film Studios. Principal photography finished on November 11, 2013.[17]/nThe bombe seen in the film is based on a replica of Turing's original machine, which is housed in the museum at Bletchley Park. However, production designer Maria Djurkovic admitted that her team made the machine more cinematic by making it larger and having more of its internal mechanisms visible.[18]/nThe Weinstein Company acquired the film for $7 million in February 2014, the highest amount ever paid for US distribution rights at the European Film Market.[19] The film is also a recipient of Tribeca Film Festival's Sloan Filmmaker Fund, which grants filmmakers funding and guidance with regard to innovative films that are concerned with science, mathematics, and technology.[20]/nIn June 2014, it was announced that Alexandre Desplat would provide the original score of the film.[22] It was recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London. Desplat uses continuous piano arpeggios to represent both Turing's thinking mind and the workings of a mechanical machine.[21] He said of the complexity of the continuity and structure of the score:/n[W]hen the camera at the end of the film has those beautiful shots of the young boy, the young Alan, and he's meeting with the professor who's telling him his friend Christopher is dead, and the camera is pushing in on him, I play Christopher's theme that we heard very early on in the film. There's a simple continuity there. It's the accumulation of these moments that I can slowly but surely play that make it even stronger.[21]/nThe score received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score, losing to the score of The Grand Budapest Hotel, also composed by Desplat./nFollowing the Royal Pardon granted by the British government to Turing on December 24, 2013, the filmmakers released the first official promotional photograph of Cumberbatch in character beside Turing's bombe.[23][24] In the week of the anniversary of Turing's death in June 2014, Entertainment Weekly released two new stills which marked the first look at the characters played by Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Matthew Beard, and Allen Leech.[25] On what would have been Turing's 102nd birthday on June 23, Empire released two photographs featuring Mark Strong and Charles Dance in character. Promotional stills were taken by photographer Jack English, who also photographed Cumberbatch for Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.[26]/nPrinceton University Press and Vintage Books both released film tie-in editions of Andrew Hodges' biography Alan Turing: The Enigma in September 2014.[27] The first UK and US trailers were released on July 22, 2014.[28] The international teaser poster was released on September 18, 2014, with the tagline \"The true enigma was the man who cracked the code\".[29]/nIn November 2014, the Weinstein Company co-hosted a private screening of the film with Digital Sky Technologies billionaire Yuri Milner and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Attendees of the screening at Los Altos Hills, California included Silicon Valley's top executives, such as Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, LinkedIn's Reid Hoffman, Google co-founder Sergey Brin, Airbnb's Nathan Blecharczyk, and Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes. Director Tyldum, screenwriter Moore, and actress Knightley were also in attendance.[30] In addition, Cumberbatch and Zuckerberg presented the Mathematics Prizes at the Breakthrough Awards on November 10, 2014, in honour of Turing.[31]/nThe bombe re-created by the filmmakers has been on display in a special The Imitation Game exhibition at Bletchley Park since November 10, 2014. The year-long exhibit features clothes worn by the actors and props used in the film.[32]/nThe official film website allowed visitors to unlock exclusive content by solving cryptic crossword puzzles supposedly conceived by Turing.[33] The website puzzle was a shorter version[34] of the Daily Telegraph puzzle of January 13, 1942 that was actually used in Bletchley Park recruitment during the war[35] (and the puzzle was not set by Turing, who was no good at them).[34] Google, which sponsored the New York Premiere of the film, launched a competition called \"The Code-Cracking Challenge\" on November 23, 2014. It is a skill contest where entrants must crack a code provided by Google. The prize/s will be awarded to entrant/s who crack the code and submit their entry the fastest.[36]/nIn November 2014, ahead of the film's US release, The New York Times reprinted the 1942 puzzle from The Daily Telegraph used in recruiting codebreakers at Bletchley Park during the Second World War. Entrants who solved the puzzle could mail in their results for a chance to win a trip for two to London and a tour of Bletchley Park.[37]/nTWC launched a print and online campaign on January 2, 2015, featuring testimonials from leaders in the fields of technology, military, academia, and LGBTQ groups (all influenced by Turing's life and accomplishments) to promote the film and Turing's legacy. Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, and Wikipedia's Jimmy Wales all gave tribute quotes.

Its opening box office figure was the third highest opening weekend haul for a British film in 2014. Its opening was 107% higher than that of Argo, 81% higher than Philomena and 26% higher than The Iron Lady following its debut.[48][49]/nDebuting in four cinemas in Los Angeles and New York on November 28, the film grossed $479,352 in its opening weekend with a $119,352 per-screen-average, the second highest per-screen-average of 2014 and the 7th highest of all time for a live-action film. Adjusted for inflation, it outperformed the Weinstein Company's own Oscar-winning films The King's Speech ($88,863 in 2010) and The Artist ($51,220 in 2011), which were also released on Thanksgiving weekend. The film expanded into additional markets on December 12 and was released nationwide on Christmas Day.[50][51][52]/nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on 287 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"With an outstanding starring performance from Benedict Cumberbatch illuminating its fact-based story, The Imitation Game serves as an eminently well-made entry in the 'prestige biopic' genre.\"[53] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[54] The film received a rare average grade of \"A+\" from market-research firm CinemaScore, and a 90% \"definite recommend\" rating from its core audience, according to PostTrak. It was also included in both the National Board of Review and American Film Institute's \"Top 10 Films of 2014\".[55][56][57]/nThe New York Observer's Rex Reed declared that \"one of the most important stories of the last century is one of the greatest movies of 2014\".[58] Kaleem Aftab of The Independent gave the film a five-star review, hailing it the \"Best British Film of the Year\".[59][60] Empire described it as a \"superb thriller\" and Glamour declared it \"an instant classic\".[61][62] Peter Debruge of Variety added that the film is \"beautifully written, elegantly mounted and poignantly performed\".[63] Critic Scott Foundas stated that the \"movie is undeniably strong in its sense of a bright light burned out too soon, and the often undignified fate of those who dare to chafe at society's established norms\".[64] Critic Leonard Maltin asserted that the film has \"an ideal ensemble cast with every role filled to perfection\". Praise went to Knightley's supporting performance as Clarke, Goldenberg's editing, Desplat's score, Faura's cinematography and Djurkovic's production design.[65] The film was enthusiastically received at the Telluride Film Festival and won the \"People's Choice Award for Best Film\" at TIFF, the highest prize of the festival./nCumberbatch's performance was met with widespread acclaim from critics. TIME ranked Cumberbatch's portrayal number one in its Top 10 film performances of 2014, with the magazine's chief film critic Richard Corliss calling Cumberbatch's characterisation \"the actor's oddest, fullest, most Cumberbatchian character yet ... he doesn't play Turing so much as inhabit him, bravely and sympathetically but without mediation\".[66][67] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times declared Turing \"the role of Cumberbatch's career\", while A.O. Scott of The New York Times stated that it is \"one of the year's finest pieces of screen acting\".[68][69] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone asserted that the actor \"gives an explosive, emotionally complex\" portrayal. Critic Clayton Davis stated that it is a \"performance for the ages\u00a0... proving he's one of the best actors working today\".[70][71] Foundas of Variety wrote that Cumberbatch's acting is \"masterful\u00a0... a marvel to watch\", Manohla Dargis of The New York Times described it as \"delicately nuanced, prickly and tragic\" and Owen Gleiberman of the BBC proclaimed it an \"emotionally tailored perfection\".[72][73] It is \"a storming performance from Cumberbatch: you'll be deciphering his work long after the credits roll\" declared Dave Calhoun of Time Out.[74] In addition, Claudia Puig of USA Today concluded in her review, \"It's Cumberbatch's nuanced, haunted performance that leaves the most powerful impression\".[75] The Hollywood Reporter's Todd McCarthy reported that the undeniable highlight of the film was Cumberbatch, \"whose charisma, tellingly modulated and naturalistic array of eccentricities, talent at indicating a mind never at rest and knack for simultaneously portraying physical oddness and attractiveness combine to create an entirely credible portrait of genius at work\".[76][77] Gossip blogger Roger Friedman wrote at the end of his review, \"Cumberbatch may be the closest thing we have to a real descendant of Sir Laurence Olivier\".[78]/nWhile praising the performances of Cumberbatch and Knightley, Catherine Shoard of The Guardian stated that the film is \"too formulaic, too efficient at simply whisking you through and making sure you've clocked the diversity message,\"[79] going on to raise concerns about the film's alleged reluctance to show Turing \"romantically or sexually involved with a man.[80] Tim Robey of The Telegraph described it as \"a film about a human calculator which feels\u00a0... a little too calculated\".[81] British historian Alex von Tunzelmann, writing for The Guardian in November 2014, pointed out many historical inaccuracies in the film, saying in conclusion: \"Historically, The Imitation Game is as much of a garbled mess as a heap of unbroken code\".[82] Journalist Christian Caryl also found numerous historical inaccuracies, describing the film as constituting \"a bizarre departure from the historical record\" that changed Turing's rich life to be \"multiplex-friendly\".[83] L.V. Anderson of Slate magazine compared the film's account of Turing's life and work to the biography it was based on, writing, \"I discovered that The Imitation Game takes major liberties with its source material, injecting conflict where none existed, inventing entirely fictional characters, rearranging the chronology of events, and misrepresenting the very nature of Turing's work at Bletchley Park\".[84] Andrew Grant of Science News wrote, \"... like so many other Hollywood biopics, it takes some major artistic license \u2013 which is disappointing, because Turing's actual story is so compelling.\"[85] Computing historian Thomas Haigh, writing in the journal Communications of the ACM, said that \"the film is a bad guide to reality but a useful summary of everything that the popular imagination gets wrong about Bletchley Park\", that it \"combines the traditional focus of popular science writing on the lone genius who changes the world with the modern movie superhero narrative of a freak who must overcome his own flaws before he can save the world\", and that, together with the likes of A Beautiful Mind and The Theory of Everything, is part of a trend of \"glossy scientific biopic[s]\" that emphasize those famous scientists who were surrounded by tragedy rather than those who found contented lives, which in turn affects the way \"[s]ome kinds of people, and work, have become famous and others have not.\"[86] The visual blog Information Is Beautiful deduced that, while taking creative licence into account, the film was 42.3% accurate when compared to real-life events, commenting that \"to be fair, shoe-horning the incredible complexity of the Enigma machine and cryptography in general was never going to be easy. But this film just rips the historical record to shreds.\"[87]/nDespite earlier reservations, Turing's niece Inagh Payne told Allan Beswick of BBC Radio Manchester that the film \"really did honour my uncle\" after she watched the film at the London Film Festival in October 2014. In the same interview, Turing's nephew Dermot Turing stated that Cumberbatch is \"perfect casting. I couldn't think of anyone better.\" James Turing, a great-nephew of the code-breaker, said Cumberbatch \"knows things that I never knew before. The amount of knowledge he has about Alan is amazing.\"[88]/nThe Imitation Game was nominated for, and received, numerous awards, with Cumberbatch's portrayal of Turing particularly praised.[89][90][91] The film and its cast and crew were also honoured by Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBT civil rights advocacy group and political lobbying organisation in the United States. \"We are proud to honor the stars and filmmakers of The Imitation Game for bringing the captivating yet tragic story of Alan Turing to the big screen\", HRC president Chad Griffin said in a statement.[92]/nIn January 2015, Cumberbatch, comedian-actor Stephen Fry, producer Harvey Weinstein, and Turing's great-niece Rachel Barnes launched a campaign to pardon the 49,000 gay men convicted under the same law that led to Turing's chemical castration. An open letter published in The Guardian urged the British government and the Royal family, particularly Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, to aid the campaign.[93]/nThe Human Rights Campaign's Chad Griffin also offered his endorsement, saying: \"Over 49,000 other gay men and women were persecuted in England under the same law. Turing was pardoned by Queen Elizabeth II in 2013. The others were not. Honor this movie. Honor this man. And honor the movement to bring justice to the other 49,000.\"[94] Aiding the cause were campaigner Peter Tatchell, Attitude magazine, and other high-profile figures in the gay community.[95]/nIn February 2015, Matt Damon, Michael Douglas, Jessica Alba, Bryan Cranston, and Anna Wintour among others joined the petition at Pardon49k.org demanding pardons for victims of anti-gay laws.[96][97] Historians, including Justin Bengry of Birkbeck University of London and Matt Houlbrook of the University of Birmingham, argued that such a pardon would be \"bad history\" despite its political appeal, because of the broad variety of cases in which the historical laws were applied (including cases of rape) and the distortion of history resulting from an attempt to clean up the wrongdoings of the past post facto. Bengry also cites the existing ability of those convicted under repealed anti-homosexuality laws to have their convictions declared spent.[98]/nThis petition eventually resulted in the Policing and Crime Act 2017, informally known as the Alan Turing law, which serves as an amnesty law to pardon men who were cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts, and which was implemented on January 31, 2017.[99] As the law and the disregard process applies only to England and Wales, groups in Northern Ireland and Scotland have campaigned for equivalent laws in their jurisdictions.[100][101]/nDuring production, there was criticism regarding the film's purported downplaying of Turing's homosexuality,[102] particularly condemning the portrayal of his relationship with close friend and one-time fianc\u00e9e Joan Clarke. Hodges, author of the book upon which the film was based, described the script as having \"built up the relationship with Joan much more than it actually was\".[103] Turing's niece Payne thought that Knightley was inappropriately cast, as she described the real Clarke as \"rather plain\", and said: \"I think they might be trying to romanticize it. It makes me a bit mad. You want the film to show it as it was, not a lot of nonsense.\"[104]/nSpeaking to Empire, director Tyldum expressed his decision to take on the project: \"It is such a complex story. It was the gay rights element, but also how his (Turing's) ideas were kept secret and how incredibly important his work was during the war, that he was never given credit for it\".[26] In an interview for GQ UK, Matthew Goode, who plays fellow cryptographer Hugh Alexander in the film, stated that the script focuses on \"Turing's life and how as a nation we celebrated him as being a hero by chemically castrating him because he was gay\".[105] The producers of the film stated: \"There is not \u2013 and never has been \u2013 a version of our script where Alan Turing is anything other than homosexual, nor have we included fictitious sex scenes.\"[106]/nIn a January 2015 interview with The Huffington Post, its screenwriter Graham Moore said in response to complaints about the film's historical accuracy:/nWhen you use the language of \"fact checking\" to talk about a film, I think you're sort of fundamentally misunderstanding how art works. You don't fact check Monet's Water Lilies. That's not what water lilies look like, that's what the sensation of experiencing water lilies feel like. That's the goal of the piece.[107]/nIn the same interview, Tyldum stated:/nA lot of historical films sometimes feel like people reading a Wikipedia page to you onscreen, like just reciting \"and then he did that, and then he did that, and then he did this other thing\" \u2013 it's like a \"Greatest Hits\" compilation. We wanted the movie to be emotional and passionate. Our goal was to give you \"What does Alan Turing feel like?\" What does his story feel like? What'd it feel like to be Alan Turing? Can we create the experience of sort of \"Alan Turing-ness\" for an audience based on his life?[107]/nFor the most part, Hodges has not commented on the historical accuracy of the film, alluding to contractual obligations involving the film rights to his biography.[108]/nSeveral events depicted in the film did not happen in real life. The visual blog Information is Beautiful deduced that, while taking creative license into account, the film was just 42.3% accurate when compared to real-life events, summarizing that \"shoe-horning the incredible complexity of the Enigma machine and cryptography in general was never going to be easy. But this film just rips the historical records to shreds\".[109] GCHQ Departmental Historian Tony Comer went even further in his criticism of the film's inaccuracies, saying that \"The Imitation Game [only] gets two things absolutely right.

His most influential work was Aether and Matter, a theoretical physics book published in 1900./nHe was born in Magheragall in County Antrim the son of Hugh Larmor, a Belfast shopkeeper and his wife, Anna Wright.[3] The family moved to Belfast circa 1860, and he was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, and then studied mathematics and experimental science at Queen's College, Belfast (BA 1874, MA 1875),[4] where one of his teachers was John Purser. He subsequently studied at St John's College, Cambridge, where in 1880 he was Senior Wrangler (J. J.

Larmor believed the aether was separate from matter. He united Lord Kelvin's model of spinning gyrostats (see Vortex theory of the atom) with this theory. Larmor held that matter consisted of particles moving in the aether. Larmor believed the source of electric charge was a \"particle\" (which as early as 1894 he was referring to as the electron). Larmor held that the flow of charged particles constitutes the current of conduction (but was not part of the atom). Larmor calculated the rate of energy radiation from an accelerating electron. Larmor explained the splitting of the spectral lines in a magnetic field by the oscillation of electrons.[17]/nLarmor also created the first solar system model of the atom in 1897.[18] He also postulated the proton, calling it a \u201cpositive electron.\u201d He said the destruction of this type of atom making up matter \u201cis an occurrence of infinitely small probability.\u201d/nIn 1919, Larmor proposed sunspots are self-regenerative dynamo action on the Sun's surface./nQuotes from one of Larmor's voluminous work include:/nParallel to the development of Lorentz ether theory, Larmor published an approximation to the Lorentz transformations in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1897,[20]\nnamely \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n1\n\n\n=\nx\n\n\u03f5\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x_{1}=x\\epsilon ^{\\frac {1}{2}}}\n\n for the spatial part and \n\n\n\nd\n\nt\n\n1\n\n\n=\nd\n\nt\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n\u03f5\n\n\u2212\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle dt_{1}=dt^{\\prime }\\epsilon ^{-{\\frac {1}{2}}}}\n\n for the temporal part, where \n\n\n\n\u03f5\n=\n\n\n(\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nv\n\n2\n\n\n\n/\n\n\nc\n\n2\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\epsilon =\\left(1-v^{2}/c^{2}\\right)^{-1}}\n\n and the local time \n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\u2032\n\n\n=\nt\n\u2212\nv\nx\n\n/\n\n\nc\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t^{\\prime }=t-vx/c^{2}}\n\n.

Larmor predicted the phenomenon of time dilation, at least for orbiting electrons, by writing  (Larmor 1897): \"... individual electrons describe corresponding parts of their orbits in times shorter for the [rest] system in the ratio\u00a0(1\u00a0\u2013\u00a0v2/c2)1/2\". He also verified that the FitzGerald\u2013Lorentz contraction (length contraction) should occur for bodies whose atoms were held together by electromagnetic forces. In his book Aether and Matter (1900), he again presented the Lorentz transformations, time dilation and length contraction (treating these as dynamic rather than kinematic effects). Larmor was opposed to the spacetime interpretation of the Lorentz transformation in special relativity because he continued to believe in an absolute aether. He was also critical of the curvature of space of general relativity, to the extent that he claimed that an absolute time was essential to astronomy (Larmor 1924, 1927)./nLarmor edited the collected works of George Stokes, James Thomson and William Thomson.", "239126": "William Jones, FRS (1675\u00a0\u2013 1 July 1749[1]) was a Welsh mathematician, most noted for his use of the symbol \u03c0 (the Greek letter Pi) to represent the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

This used \u03c0 for the ratio of circumference to diameter, following earlier abbreviations for the Greek word periphery (\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) by William Oughtred and others.[6][7][8][9][10] His 1711 work Analysis per quantitatum series, fluxiones ac differentias introduced the dot notation for differentiation in calculus.[11]/nHe was noticed and befriended by two of Britain's foremost mathematicians \u2013 Edmund Halley and Sir Isaac Newton \u2013 and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1711. He later became the editor and publisher of many of Newton's manuscripts and built up an extraordinary library that was one of the greatest collections of books on science and mathematics ever known, and only recently fully dispersed.[12]/nHe married twice, firstly the widow of his counting-house employer, whose property he inherited on her death, and secondly, in 1731, Mary, the 22-year-old daughter of cabinet-maker George Nix, with whom he had two surviving children. His son, also named William Jones and born in 1746, was a renowned philologist who established links between Latin, Greek and Sanskrit, leading to the concept of the Indo-European language group.[13]", "140824": "Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher FRS[5] (17 February 1890\u00a0\u2013 29 July 1962) was a British polymath who was active as a mathematician, statistician, biologist, geneticist, and academic.[6] For his work in statistics, he has been described as \"a genius who almost single-handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science\"[7][8] and \"the single most important figure in 20th century statistics\".[9] In genetics, his work used mathematics to combine Mendelian genetics and natural selection; this contributed to the revival of Darwinism in the early 20th-century revision of the theory of evolution known as the modern synthesis, being the one to most comprehensively combine the ideas of Gregor Mendel and Charles Darwin.[10] For his contributions to biology, Richard Dawkins proclaimed Fisher as \"the greatest of Darwin\u2019s successors\".[11] He is considered one of the founding fathers of Neo-Darwinism.[12][13]/nFrom 1919, he worked at the Rothamsted Experimental Station for 14 years;[14] there, he analysed its immense body of data from crop experiments since the 1840s, and developed the analysis of variance (ANOVA). He established his reputation there in the following years as a biostatistician./nTogether with J. B. S. Haldane and Sewall Wright, Fisher is known as one of the three principal founders of population genetics. He outlined Fisher's principle, the Fisherian runaway and sexy son hypothesis theories of sexual selection.  His contributions to statistics include promoting the method of maximum likelihood and deriving the properties of maximum likelihood estimators, fiducial inference, the derivation of various sampling distributions, founding principles of the design of experiments, and much more./nFisher held strong views on race and eugenics, insisting on racial differences. Although he was clearly a eugenicist, there is some debate as to whether Fisher supported scientific racism (see Ronald Fisher \u00a7\u00a0Views on race). He was the Galton Professor of Eugenics at University College London and editor of the Annals of Eugenics.[15]/nFisher was born in East Finchley in London, England, into a middle-class household; his father, George, was a successful partner in Robinson & Fisher, auctioneers and fine art dealers.[16] He was one of twins, with the other twin being still-born[17] and grew up the youngest, with three sisters and one brother.[18] From 1896 until 1904 they lived at Inverforth House in London, where English Heritage installed a blue plaque in 2002, before moving to Streatham.[19] His mother, Kate, died from acute peritonitis when he was 14, and his father lost his business 18 months later.[16]/nLifelong poor eyesight caused his rejection by the British Army for World War I,[20] but also developed his ability to visualize problems in geometrical terms, not in writing mathematical solutions, or proofs. He entered Harrow School age 14 and won the school's Neeld Medal in mathematics. In 1909, he won a scholarship to study Mathematics at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. In 1912, he gained a First in Mathematics.[21] \nIn 1915 he published a paper The evolution of sexual preference[22] on sexual selection and mate choice./nDuring 1913\u20131919, Fisher worked as a statistician in the City of London and taught physics and maths at a sequence of public schools, at the Thames Nautical Training College, and at Bradfield College. There he settled with his new bride, Eileen Guinness, with whom he had two sons and six daughters.[23]/nIn 1918 he published \"The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance\", in which he introduced the term variance and proposed its formal analysis.[24] He put forward a genetics conceptual model showing that continuous variation amongst phenotypic traits measured by biostatisticians could be produced by the combined action of many discrete genes and thus be the result of Mendelian inheritance. This was the first step towards establishing population genetics and quantitative genetics, which demonstrated that natural selection could change allele frequencies in a population, reconciling its discontinuous nature with gradual evolution.[25] Joan Box, Fisher's biographer and daughter, says that Fisher had resolved this problem already in 1911.[26] Today, Fisher's additive model is still regularly used in genome-wide association studies.[27]/nIn 1919, he began working at the Rothamsted Experimental Station in Hertfordshire, where he would remain for 14 years.[14] He had been offered a position at the Galton Laboratory in University College London led by Karl Pearson, but instead accepted a temporary role at Rothamsted to investigate the possibility of analysing the vast amount of crop data accumulated since 1842 from the \"Classical Field Experiments\". He analysed the data recorded over many years, and in 1921 published Studies in Crop Variation I, his first application of the analysis of variance (ANOVA).[28] Studies in Crop Variation II written with his first assistant, Winifred Mackenzie, became the model for later ANOVA work. [29] Later assistants who mastered and propagated Fisher's methods were Joseph Oscar Irwin John Wishart and Frank Yates. Between 1912 and 1922 Fisher recommended, analyzed (with heuristic proofs) and vastly popularized the maximum likelihood estimation method.[30]/nFisher's 1924 article On a distribution yielding the error functions of several well known statistics presented Pearson's chi-squared test and William Gosset's Student's t-distribution in the same framework as the Gaussian distribution, and is where he developed Fisher's z-distribution, a new statistical method commonly used decades later as the F-distribution. He pioneered the principles of the design of experiments and the statistics of small samples and the analysis of real data.[citation needed]/nIn 1925 he published Statistical Methods for Research Workers, one of the 20th century's most influential books on statistical methods.[31] Fisher's method[32][33] is a technique for data fusion or \"meta-analysis\" (analysis of analyses). This book also popularized the p-value, which plays a central role in his approach. Fisher proposes the level p=0.05, or a 1 in 20 chance of being exceeded by chance, as a limit for statistical significance, and applies this to a normal distribution (as a two-tailed test), yielding the rule of two standard deviations (on a normal distribution) for statistical significance.[34] The significance of 1.96, the approximate value of the 97.5 percentile point of the normal distribution used in probability and statistics, also originated in this book./n\"The value for which P = 0.05, or 1 in 20, is 1.96 or nearly 2\u00a0; it is convenient to take this point as a limit in judging whether a deviation is to be considered significant or not.\"[35]/nIn Table 1 of the work, he gave the more precise value 1.959964.[36]/nIn 1928, Fisher was the first to use diffusion equations to attempt to calculate the distribution of allele frequencies and the estimation of genetic linkage by maximum likelihood methods among populations.[37]/nIn 1930, The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection was first published by Clarendon Press and is dedicated to Leonard Darwin. A core work of the neo-Darwinian modern evolutionary synthesis,[38] it helped define population genetics, which Fisher founded alongside Sewall Wright and J. B. S. Haldane, and revived Darwin's neglected idea of sexual selection.[39]/nOne of Fisher's favourite aphorisms was \"Natural selection is a mechanism for generating an exceedingly high degree of improbability.\"[40]/nFisher's fame grew, and he began to travel and lecture widely. In 1931, he spent six weeks at the Statistical Laboratory at Iowa State College where he gave three lectures per week, and met many American statisticians, including George W. Snedecor. He returned there again in 1936.[citation needed]/nIn 1933, Fisher became the head of the Department of Eugenics at University College London.[41] In 1934, he become editor of the Annals of Eugenics (now called Annals of Human Genetics)./nIn 1935, he published The Design of Experiments, which was \"also fundamental, [and promoted] statistical technique and application... The mathematical justification of the methods was not stressed and proofs were often barely sketched or omitted altogether .... [This] led H.B. Mann to fill the gaps with a rigorous mathematical treatment\".[31][42] \nIn this book Fisher also outlined the Lady tasting tea, now a famous design of a statistical randomized experiment which uses Fisher's exact test and is the original exposition of Fisher's notion of a null hypothesis.[43][44]/nThe same year he also published a paper on fiducial inference[45][46] and applied it to the Behrens\u2013Fisher problem, the solution to which, proposed first by Walter Behrens and a few years later by Fisher, is the Behrens\u2013Fisher distribution./nIn 1936 he introduced the Iris flower data set as an example of discriminant analysis.[47]/nIn his 1937 paper The wave of advance of advantageous genes he proposed Fisher's equation in the context of population dynamics to describe the spatial spread of an advantageous allele, and explored its travelling wave solutions.[48] Out of this also came the Fisher\u2013Kolmogorov equation.[49]\nIn 1937, he visited the Indian Statistical Institute in Calcutta, and its one part-time employee, P. C. Mahalanobis, often returning to encourage its development. He was the guest of honour at its 25th anniversary in 1957, when it had 2000 employees.[50]/nIn 1938, Fisher and Frank Yates described the Fisher\u2013Yates shuffle in their book Statistical tables for biological, agricultural and medical research.[51] Their description of the algorithm used pencil and paper; a table of random numbers provided the randomness./nIn 1943, along with A.S. Corbet and C.B. Williams he published a paper on relative species abundance where he developed the log series distribution (sometimes called the logarithmic distribution) to fit two different abundance data sets.[52][53][54] In the same year he took the Balfour Chair of Genetics where the Italian researcher Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza was recruited in 1948, establishing a one-man unit of bacterial genetics./nIn 1936, Fisher used a Pearson's chi-squared test to analyze Mendel's data and concluded that Mendel's results were far too perfect, suggesting that adjustments (intentional or unconscious) had been made to the data to make the observations fit the hypothesis.[55] Later authors have claimed Fisher's analysis was flawed, proposing various statistical and botanical explanations for Mendel's numbers.[56][57] In 1947, Fisher co-founded the journal Heredity with Cyril Darlington and in 1949 he published The Theory of Inbreeding./nIn 1950 he published \"Gene Frequencies in a Cline Determined by Selection and Diffusion\".[58] He developed computational algorithms for analyzing data from his balanced experimental designs,[59] with various editions and translations, becoming a standard reference work for scientists in many disciplines. In ecological genetics he and E. B. Ford showed that the force of natural selection was much stronger than had been assumed, with many ecogenetic situations (such as polymorphism) being maintained by the force of selection./nDuring this time he also worked on mouse chromosome mapping, breeding the mice in laboratories in his own house.[60]/nFisher publicly spoke out against the 1950 study showing that smoking tobacco causes lung cancer, arguing that correlation does not imply causation.[61][62][63][64][65][66] To quote his biographers Yates and Mather, \"It has been suggested that the fact that Fisher was employed as consultant by the tobacco firms in this controversy casts doubt on the value of his arguments. This is to misjudge the man. He was not above accepting financial reward for his labours, but the reason for his interest was undoubtedly his dislike and mistrust of puritanical tendencies of all kinds; and perhaps also the personal solace he had always found in tobacco.\"[5] Others have suggested that his analysis was biased by professional conflicts and his own love of smoking;[67] he was a heavy pipe smoker.[68]/nHe gave the 1953 Croonian lecture on population genetics.[69]/nIn the winter of 1954\u20131955 Fisher met Debabrata Basu, the Indian statistician who wrote in 1988, \"With his reference set argument, Sir Ronald was trying to find a via media between the two poles of Statistics\u00a0\u2013 Berkeley and Bayes.[70] My efforts to understand this Fisher compromise led me to the likelihood principle\".[71]/nIn 1957, a retired Fisher emigrated to Australia, where he spent time as a senior research fellow at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Adelaide, South Australia.[72] During this time, he continued in his denial of tobacco harm, and enlisted German eugenicist Otmar von Verschuer to his cause.[68]/nFollowing surgery for colon cancer, he died of post-operative complications in Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Adelaide in 1962.[72][68] His remains are interred in St Peter's Cathedral, Adelaide.[72]/nFisher's doctoral students included Walter Bodmer,[2] D. J. Finney, Ebenezer Laing,[3][2] Mary F. Lyon[4] and C. R. Rao.[2] Although a prominent opponent of Bayesian statistics, Fisher was the first to use the term \"Bayesian\", in 1950.[73] The 1930 The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection is commonly cited in biology books, and outlines many important concepts, such as:/nFisher is also known for:/nFisher married Eileen Guinness, with whom he had two sons and six daughters.[23]\nHis marriage disintegrated during World War II, and his older son George, an aviator, was killed in combat.[91] His daughter Joan, who wrote a biography of her father, married the statistician George E. P. Box.[92]/nAccording to Yates and Mather, \"His large family, in particular, reared in conditions of great financial stringency, was a personal expression of his genetic and evolutionary convictions.\"[5] Fisher was noted for being loyal, and was seen as a patriot, a member of the Church of England, politically conservative, as well as a scientific rationalist. He developed a reputation for carelessness in his dress and was the archetype of the absent-minded professor. H. Allen Orr describes him in the Boston Review as a \"deeply devout Anglican who, between founding modern statistics and population genetics, penned articles for church magazines\".[93] In a 1955 broadcast on Science and Christianity,[5] he said:/nThe custom of making abstract dogmatic assertions is not, certainly, derived from the teaching of Jesus, but has been a widespread weakness among religious teachers in subsequent centuries. I do not think that the word for the Christian virtue of faith should be prostituted to mean the credulous acceptance of all such piously intended assertions. Much self-deception in the young believer is needed to convince himself that he knows that of which in reality he knows himself to be ignorant. That surely is hypocrisy, against which we have been most conspicuously warned./nFisher was involved with the Society for Psychical Research.[94][95]/nBetween 1950 and 1951, Fisher, along with other leading geneticists and anthropologists of his time, was asked to comment on a statement that UNESCO was preparing on the nature of race and racial differences, which was published in 1950 as the UNESCO Statement on Race. The statement, along with the comments and criticisms of a large number of scientists including Fisher, is published in \"The Race Concept: Results of an Inquiry\" (1952).[96]/nFisher was one of four scientists who opposed the statement.  In his own words, Fisher's opposition is based on \"one fundamental objection to the Statement,\"  which \"destroys the very spirit of the whole document.\"  He believes that human groups differ profoundly \"in their innate capacity for intellectual and emotional development\" and concludes from this that the \"practical international problem is that of learning to share the resources of this planet amicably with persons of materially different nature, and that this problem is being obscured by entirely well-intentioned efforts to minimize the real differences that exist.\"[97][98][99]/nFisher's opinions are clarified by his more detailed comments on Section 5 of the statement, which are concerned with psychological and mental differences between the races. Section 5 concludes as follows:/nScientifically, however, we realized that any common psychological attribute is more likely to be due to a common historical and social background, and that such attributes may obscure the fact that, within different populations consisting of many human types, one will find approximately the same range of temperament and intelligence.[96]:\u200a14/nOf the entire statement, Section 5 recorded the most dissenting viewpoints.  It was recorded that \"Fisher's attitude \u2026 is the same as Muller's and Sturtevant's\".[96]:\u200a56\u200a Muller's criticism was recorded in more detail and was noted to \"represent an important trend of ideas\":/nI quite agree with the chief intention of the article as a whole, which, I take it, is to bring out the relative unimportance of such genetic mental differences between races as may exist, in contrast to the importance of the mental differences (between individuals as well as between nations) caused by tradition, training and other aspects of the environment.  However, in view of the admitted existence of some physically expressed hereditary differences of a conspicuous nature, between the averages or the medians of the races, it would be strange if there were not also some hereditary differences affecting the mental characteristics which develop in a given environment, between these averages or medians.  At the same time, these mental differences might usually be unimportant in comparison with those between individuals of the same race\u2026. To the great majority of geneticists it seems absurd to suppose that psychological characteristics are subject to entirely different laws of heredity or development than other biological characteristics.  Even though the former characteristics are far more influenced than the latter by environment, in the form of past experiences, they must have a highly complex genetic basis.[96]:\u200a52/nFisher's own words were quoted as follows:/nAs you ask for remarks and suggestions, there is one that occurs to me, unfortunately of a somewhat fundamental nature, namely that the Statement as it stands appears to draw a distinction between the body and mind of men, which must, I think, prove untenable.  It appears to me unmistakable that gene differences which influence the growth or physiological development of an organism will ordinarily pari passu influence the congenital inclinations and capacities of the mind.  In fact, I should say that, to vary conclusion (2) on page 5, 'Available scientific knowledge provides a firm basis for believing that the groups of mankind differ in their innate capacity for intellectual and emotional development,' seeing that such groups do differ undoubtedly in a very large number of their genes.[96]:\u200a56/nFisher also ended a 1954 letter to Reginald Ruggles Gates, a Canadian-born geneticist who argued that different racial groups were different species, with the words:/nI am sorry that there should be propaganda in favour of miscegenation in North America as I am sure it can do nothing but harm. Is it beyond human endeavour to give and justly administer equal rights to all citizens without fooling ourselves that these are equivalent items?[100]/nFisher's writings nearly all discuss human populations or humanity as a whole without reference to race or specific racial groups, and none of his work explicitly supports the idea of racial superiority or white supremacy.[100] Fisher had a close personal relationship with Indian statistician P.C. Mahalanobis, and significantly contributed to the development of the Indian Statistical Institute; and Fisher's graduate students included Walter Bodmer, a child of Jewish-German parents who fled from Nazi Germany while he was young, and Ebenezer Laing, an African geneticist from Ghana.[100] Daniel Kevles, an American historian of science, described Fisher as an \"anti-racist conservative.\"[100] However, British historian Robert J. Evans, writing in The New Statesman, argued that Fisher's views on eugenics and his opposition to UNESCO's statement about genetic racial differences were indicative of racism.[101]/nIn 1911 Fisher became founding Chairman of the University of Cambridge Eugenics Society, whose other founding members included John Maynard Keynes, R. C. Punnett, and Horace Darwin. After members of the Cambridge Society \u2013 including Fisher \u2013 stewarded the First International Eugenics Congress in London in summer 1912, a link was forged with the Eugenics Society (UK).[102] He saw eugenics as addressing pressing social and scientific issues that encompassed and drove his interest in both genetics and statistics. During World War I Fisher started writing book reviews for The Eugenics Review and volunteered to undertake all such reviews for the journal, being hired for a part-time position./nThe last third of The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection focused on eugenics, attributing the fall of civilizations to the fertility of their upper classes being diminished, and used British 1911 census data to show an inverse relationship between fertility and social class, which was partly due, he claimed, to the lower financial costs and hence increasing social status of families with fewer children. He proposed the abolition of extra allowances to large families, with the allowances proportional to the earnings of the father.[103][104][105] He served in several official committees to promote eugenics, including the Committee for Legalizing Eugenic Sterilization which drafted legislation aiming to limit the fertility of \"feeble minded high-grade defectives ... comprising a tenth of the total population\". It was proposed that this policy would allow for voluntary sterlization and Fisher was against the idea of forced sterilisation.[106][107]/nBeginning in 1934, Fisher became disillusioned with the Eugenics Society over concerns that its activities were increasingly aimed in a political rather than scientific direction; he formally dissociated with the Society in 1941.[100]/nFisher wrote a testimony on behalf of the eugenicist Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer. He wrote that, although the Nazis used Verschuer's work to give scientific support for their ideology, it was \"[Verschuer's] misfortune rather than his fault that racial theory was a part of the Nazi ideology.\"[100][108] He conducted extensive correspondence with von Verschuer over decades, which is held at the University of Adelaide.[68]/nFisher was elected to the Royal Society in 1929, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1934,[109] the American Philosophical Society in 1941,[110] and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1948.[111] He was made a Knight Bachelor by Queen Elizabeth II in 1952 and awarded the Linnean Society of London Darwin\u2013Wallace Medal in 1958./nHe won the Copley Medal and the Royal Medal. He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1924 in Toronto and in 1928 in Bologna.[112]/nIn 1950, Maurice Wilkes and David Wheeler used the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator to solve a differential equation relating to gene frequencies in a paper by Ronald Fisher.[58] This represents the first use of a computer for a problem in the field of biology. The Kent distribution (also known as the Fisher\u2013Bingham distribution) was named after him and Christopher Bingham in 1982, while the Fisher kernel was named after Fisher in 1998.[113]/nThe R. A. Fisher Lectureship was a North American Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies (COPSS) annual lecture prize, established in 1963, until the name was changed to COPSS Distinguished Achievement Award and Lectureship in 2020. On 28 April 1998 a minor planet, 21451 Fisher, was named after him.[114]/nIn 2010, the R.A. Fisher Chair in Statistical Genetics was established in University College London to recognise Fisher's extraordinary contributions to both statistics and genetics./nAnders Hald called Fisher \"a genius who almost single-handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science\",[7] while Richard Dawkins named him \"the greatest biologist since Darwin\":/nNot only was he the most original and constructive of the architects of the neo-Darwinian synthesis, Fisher also was the father of modern statistics and experimental design. He therefore could be said to have provided researchers in biology and medicine with their most important research tools, as well as with the modern version of biology's central theorem.[115]/nGeoffrey Miller said of him:/nTo biologists, he was an architect of the \"modern synthesis\" that used mathematical models to integrate Mendelian genetics with Darwin's selection theories. To psychologists, Fisher was the inventor of various statistical tests that are still supposed to be used whenever possible in psychology journals. To farmers, Fisher was the founder of experimental agricultural research, saving millions from starvation through rational crop breeding programs.[116]/nFisher and Sewall Wright both contributed to the development of population genetics, which became part of the modern synthesis. The interpretation of the mathematical theories of population genetics became a bone of contention between Fisher and Wright by the mid-1920s, and the issue became acrimonious. Dispute persisted for the rest of Fisher's life.[117] A 2021 paper, authored by trustees of the \"Fisher Memorial Trust\", commented that recent criticism of Fisher could mostly be characterised as \"reconsideration of the honour given to individuals from preceding times who are felt to have contributed to social injustice in the past, or to have held views that are felt to have promoted social injustice.\"[100]/nIn June 2020, Gonville and Caius College announced that a 1989 stained-glass window commemorating Fisher's work would be removed because of his connection with eugenics.[118]  In the same month, Rothamsted Research released a statement condemning Fisher's involvement with eugenics, stating \"Rothamsted Research and the Lawes Agricultural Trust reject utterly the use of pseudo-scientific arguments to support racist or discriminatory views\". An accommodation building, built in 2018 and previously named after him, was subsequently renamed.[119] University College London also decided to remove his name from its Centre for Computational Biology.[120]", "62039578": "\u00c1gnes Szendrei is a Hungarian-American mathematician whose research concerns clones, the congruence lattice problem, and other topics in universal algebra.

His family emigrated to Canada in 1938, and subsequently he served in the Canadian Army in Europe during World War II./nBott later went to college at McGill University in Montreal, where he studied electrical engineering. He then earned a PhD in mathematics from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh in 1949. His thesis, titled Electrical Network Theory, was written under the direction of Richard Duffin.

In 1949 they proved[6]  a fundamental theorem of filter synthesis. Duffin and Bott extended earlier work by Otto Brune that requisite functions of complex frequency s could be realized by a passive network of inductors and capacitors. The proof relied on induction on the sum of the degrees of the polynomials in the numerator and denominator of the rational function.[7]\nIn his 2000 interview[8] with Allyn Jackson of the American Mathematical Society, he explained that he sees \"networks as discrete versions of harmonic theory\", so his experience with network synthesis and electronic filter topology introduced him to algebraic topology./nBott met Arnold S. Shapiro at the IAS and they worked together.\nHe studied the homotopy theory of Lie groups, using methods from Morse theory, leading to the Bott periodicity theorem (1957). In the course of this work, he introduced Morse\u2013Bott functions, an important generalization of Morse functions./nThis led to his role as collaborator over many years with Michael Atiyah, initially via the part played by periodicity in K-theory.

A contemporary reference to Nilakantha Somayaji in a Malayalam work on astrology implies that Somayaji lived to a ripe old age even to become a centenarian. Sankara Variar, a pupil of Nilakantha Somayaji, in his commentary on Tantrasamgraha titled Tantrasamgraha-vyakhya, points out that the first and last verses of Tantrasamgraha contain chronograms specifying the Kali-days of the commencement (1,680,548) and of completion (1,680,553) of Somayaji's magnum opus Tantrasamgraha. Both these days occur in 1500 CE./nIn Aryabhatiya-bhashya, Nilakantha Somayaji has stated that he was the son of Jatavedas and he had a brother named Sankara. Somayaji has further stated that he was a Bhatta belonging  to the Gargya gotra and was a follower of Asvalayana-sutra of Rigveda.

His wife was named Arya and he had two sons Rama and Dakshinamurti./nNilakantha Somayaji studied vedanta and some aspects of astronomy under one Ravi.

In colloquial Malayalam usage the word Somayaji has been corrupted to Comatiri./nNilakantha's writings substantiate his knowledge of several branches of Indian philosophy and culture. It is said that he could refer to a Mimamsa authority to establish his view-point in a debate and with equal felicity apply a grammatical dictum to the same purpose. \nIn his writings he refers to a Mimamsa authority, quotes extensively from Pingala's chandas-sutra, scriptures, Dharmasastras, Bhagavata and Vishnupurana also.

Joseph his equation of the centre for these planets remained the most accurate until the time of Johannes Kepler in the 17th century.[6]/nIn his Aryabhatiyabhasya, a commentary on Aryabhata's Aryabhatiya, Nilakantha developed a computational system for a partially heliocentric planetary model in which Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn orbit the Sun, which in turn orbits the Earth, similar to the Tychonic system later proposed by Tycho Brahe in the late 16th century.

Plato mentions him in Erastae: A Dialogue On Philosophy which places him in Athens.[2] The English translator of the same book reveals (in footnote 3) one other aspect in Oenopides life which was his travel in Egypt in which he enriched his knowledge in the art of Astronomy and Geometry by some Egyptian priests.[2]/nThe main accomplishment of Oenopides as an astronomer was his determination of the angle between the plane of the celestial equator, and the zodiac (the yearly path of the Sun in the sky). He found this angle to be 24\u00b0. In effect this amounted to measuring the inclination of the Earth axis. Oenopides's result remained the standard value for two centuries, until Eratosthenes measured it with greater precision.[3]/nOenopides also determined the value of the Great Year, that is, the shortest interval of time that is equal to both an integer number of years and an integer number of months. As the relative positions of the Sun and Moon repeat themselves after each Great Year, this offers a means to predict solar and lunar eclipses. In actual practice this is only approximately true, because the ratio of the length of the year and that of the month does not exactly match any simple mathematical fraction, and because in addition the lunar orbit varies continuously./nOenopides put the Great Year at 59 years, corresponding to 730 months. This was a good approximation, but not a perfect one, since 59 (sidereal) years are equal to 21550.1 days, while 730 (synodical) months equal 21557.3 days. The difference therefore amounts to seven days. In addition there are the interfering variations in the lunar orbit. However, a 59-year period had the advantage that it corresponded quite closely to an integer number of orbital revolutions of several planets around the Sun, which meant that their relative positions also repeated each Great Year cycle. Before Oenopides a Great Year of eight solar years was in use (= 99 months). Shortly after Oenopides, in 432 BC, Meton and Euctemon discovered the better value of 18 years, equal to 223 months (the so-called Saros period)./nWhile Oenopides's innovations as an astronomer mainly concern practical issues, as a geometer he seems to have been rather a theorist and methodologist, who set himself the task to make geometry comply with higher standards of theoretical purity. Thus he introduced the distinction between 'theorems' and 'problems': though both are involved with the solution of an exercise, a theorem is meant to be a theoretical building block to be used as the fundament of further theory, while a problem is only an isolated exercise without further follow-up or importance./nOenopides apparently also was the author of the rule that geometrical constructions should use no other means than compass and straightedge. In this context his name adheres to two specific elementary constructions of plane geometry: first, to draw from a given point a straight line perpendicular to a given straight line; and second, on a given straight line and at a given point on it, to construct a rectilineal angle equal to a given rectilineal angle./nSeveral more opinions in various areas are attributed to Oenopides:", "72001107": "Ga\u1e47e\u015ba Daivajna (born 1507, fl. 1520-1554) was a sixteenth century astronomer, astrologer, and mathematician from western India who wrote books on methods to predict eclipses, planetary conjunctions, positions, and make calculations for calendars.

While still in his teens, he was able to determine a necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial to be solvable by radicals, thereby solving a problem that had been open for 350 years. His work laid the foundations for Galois theory and group theory,[2] two major branches of abstract algebra./nGalois was a staunch republican and was heavily involved in the political turmoil that surrounded the French Revolution of 1830.  As a result of his political activism, he was arrested repeatedly, serving one jail sentence of several months. For reasons that remain obscure, shortly after his release from prison, Galois fought in a duel and died of the wounds he suffered.[3]/nGalois was born on 25 October 1811 to Nicolas-Gabriel Galois and Ad\u00e9la\u00efde-Marie (n\u00e9e Demante).[2][4] His father was a Republican and was head of Bourg-la-Reine's liberal party. His father became mayor of the village[2] after Louis XVIII returned to the throne in 1814. His mother, the daughter of a jurist, was a fluent reader of Latin and classical literature and was responsible for her son's education for his first twelve years./nIn October 1823, he entered the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand where his teacher Louis Paul \u00c9mile Richard recognized his brilliance.[5] At the age of 14, he began to take a serious interest in mathematics.[5]/nGalois found a copy of Adrien-Marie Legendre's \u00c9l\u00e9ments de G\u00e9om\u00e9trie, which, it is said, he read \"like a novel\" and mastered at the first reading. At 15, he was reading the original papers of Joseph-Louis Lagrange, such as the R\u00e9flexions sur la r\u00e9solution alg\u00e9brique des \u00e9quations which likely motivated his later work on equation theory,[6] and Le\u00e7ons sur le calcul des fonctions, work intended for professional mathematicians, yet his classwork remained uninspired and his teachers accused him of putting on the airs of a genius.[4]/nIn 1828, Galois attempted the entrance examination for the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, the most prestigious institution for mathematics in France at the time, without the usual preparation in mathematics, and failed for lack of explanations on the oral examination. In that same year, he entered the \u00c9cole Normale (then known as l'\u00c9cole pr\u00e9paratoire), a far inferior institution for mathematical studies at that time, where he found some professors sympathetic to him.[citation needed]/nIn the following year Galois's first paper, on continued fractions,[7] \nwas published. It was at around the same time that he began making fundamental discoveries in the theory of polynomial equations. He submitted two papers on this topic to the Academy of Sciences. Augustin-Louis Cauchy refereed these papers, but refused to accept them for publication for reasons that still remain unclear. However, in spite of many claims to the contrary, it is widely held that Cauchy recognized the importance of Galois's work, and that he merely suggested combining the two papers into one in order to enter it in the competition for the Academy's Grand Prize in Mathematics. Cauchy, an eminent mathematician of the time though with political views that were diametrically opposed to those of Galois, considered Galois's work to be a likely winner.[8]/nOn 28 July 1829, Galois's father died by suicide after a bitter political dispute with the village priest.[9] A couple of days later, Galois made his second and last attempt to enter the Polytechnique and failed yet again.[9] It is undisputed that Galois was more than qualified; accounts differ on why he failed. More plausible accounts state that Galois made too many logical leaps and baffled the incompetent examiner, which enraged Galois. The recent death of his father may have also influenced his behavior.[4]/nHaving been denied admission to the \u00c9cole polytechnique, Galois took the Baccalaureate examinations in order to enter the \u00c9cole normale.[9] He passed, receiving his degree on 29 December 1829.[9] His examiner in mathematics reported, \"This pupil is sometimes obscure in expressing his ideas, but he is intelligent and shows a remarkable spirit of research.\"/nGalois submitted his memoir on equation theory several times, but it was never published in his lifetime. Though his first attempt was refused by Cauchy, in February 1830 following Cauchy's suggestion he submitted it to the Academy's secretary Joseph Fourier,[9] to be considered for the Grand Prix of the Academy. Unfortunately, Fourier died soon after,[9] and the memoir was lost.[9] The prize would be awarded that year to Niels Henrik Abel posthumously and also to Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. Despite the lost memoir, Galois published three papers that year.  One laid the foundations for Galois theory.[10] The second was about the numerical resolution of equations (root finding in modern terminology).[11] The third was an important one in number theory, in which the concept of a finite field was first articulated.[12]/nGalois lived during a time of political turmoil in France. Charles X had succeeded Louis XVIII in 1824, but in 1827 his party suffered a major electoral setback and by 1830 the opposition liberal party became the majority. Charles, faced with political opposition from the chambers, staged a coup d'\u00e9tat, and issued his notorious July Ordinances, touching off the July Revolution[9] which ended with Louis Philippe becoming king. While their counterparts at the Polytechnique were making history in the streets, Galois, at the \u00c9cole Normale, was locked in by the school's director. Galois was incensed and wrote a blistering letter criticizing the director, which he submitted to the Gazette des \u00c9coles, signing the letter with his full name. Although the Gazette's editor omitted the signature for publication, Galois was expelled.[13]/nAlthough his expulsion would have formally taken effect on 4 January 1831, Galois quit school immediately and joined the staunchly Republican artillery unit of the National Guard. He divided his time between his mathematical work and his political affiliations. Due to controversy surrounding the unit, soon after Galois became a member, on 31 December 1830, the artillery of the National Guard was disbanded out of fear that they might destabilize the government. At around the same time, nineteen officers of Galois's former unit were arrested and charged with conspiracy to overthrow the government./nIn April 1831, the officers were acquitted of all charges, and on 9 May 1831, a banquet was held in their honor, with many illustrious people present, such as Alexandre Dumas. The proceedings grew riotous. At some point, Galois stood and proposed a toast in which he said, \"To Louis Philippe,\" with a dagger above his cup. The republicans at the banquet interpreted Galois's toast as a threat against the king's life and cheered. He was arrested the following day at his mother's house and held in detention at Sainte-P\u00e9lagie prison until 15 June 1831, when he had his trial.[8] Galois's defense lawyer cleverly claimed that Galois actually said, \"To Louis-Philippe, if he betrays,\" but that the qualifier was drowned out in the cheers. The prosecutor asked a few more questions, and perhaps influenced by Galois's youth, the jury acquitted him that same day.[8][9][13][14]/nOn the following Bastille Day (14 July 1831), Galois was at the head of a protest, wearing the uniform of the disbanded artillery, and came heavily armed with several pistols, a loaded rifle, and a dagger. He was again arrested.[9] During his stay in prison, Galois at one point drank alcohol for the first time at the goading of his fellow inmates. One of these inmates, Fran\u00e7ois-Vincent Raspail, recorded what Galois said while drunk in a letter from 25 July. Excerpted from the letter:[8]/nAnd I tell you, I will die in a duel on the occasion of some coquette de bas \u00e9tage. Why? Because she will invite me to avenge her honor which another has compromised.\nDo you know what I lack, my friend? I can confide it only to you: it is someone whom I can love and love only in spirit. I've lost my father and no one has ever replaced him, do you hear me...?/nRaspail continues that Galois, still in a delirium, attempted suicide, and that he would have succeeded if his fellow inmates hadn't forcibly stopped him.[8] Months later, when Galois's trial occurred on 23 October, he was sentenced to six months in prison for illegally wearing a uniform.[9][15][16] While in prison, he continued to develop his mathematical ideas. He was released on 29 April 1832./nGalois returned to mathematics after his expulsion from the \u00c9cole Normale, although he continued to spend time in political activities. After his expulsion became official in January 1831, he attempted to start a private class in advanced algebra which attracted some interest, but this waned, as it seemed that his political activism had priority.[4][8] Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson asked him to submit his work on the theory of equations, which he did on 17 January 1831. Around 4 July 1831, Poisson declared Galois's work \"incomprehensible\", declaring that \"[Galois's] argument is neither sufficiently clear nor sufficiently developed to allow us to judge its rigor\"; however, the rejection report ends on an encouraging note: \"We would then suggest that the author should publish the whole of his work in order to form a definitive opinion.\"[17] \nWhile Poisson's report was made before Galois's 14 July arrest, it took until October to reach Galois in prison. It is unsurprising, in the light of his character and situation at the time, that Galois reacted violently to the rejection letter, and decided to abandon publishing his papers through the Academy and instead publish them privately through his friend Auguste Chevalier. Apparently, however, Galois did not ignore Poisson's advice, as he began collecting all his mathematical manuscripts while still in prison, and continued polishing his ideas until his release on 29\u00a0April 1832,[13] after which he was somehow talked into a duel.[9]/nGalois's fatal duel took place on 30 May.[18] The true motives behind the duel are obscure. There has been much speculation about them. What is known is that, five days before his death, he wrote a letter to Chevalier which clearly alludes to a broken love affair.[8]/nSome archival investigation on the original letters suggests that the woman of romantic interest was St\u00e9phanie-F\u00e9licie Poterin du Motel,[19] the daughter of the physician at the hostel where Galois stayed during the last months of his life. Fragments of letters from her, copied by Galois himself (with many portions, such as her name, either obliterated or deliberately omitted), are available.[20] The letters hint that Poterin du Motel had confided some of her troubles to Galois, and this might have prompted him to provoke the duel himself on her behalf. This conjecture is also supported by other letters Galois later wrote to his friends the night before he died. Galois's cousin, Gabriel Demante, when asked if he knew the cause of the duel, mentioned that Galois \"found himself in the presence of a supposed uncle and a supposed fianc\u00e9, each of whom provoked the duel.\" Galois himself exclaimed: \"I am the victim of an infamous coquette and her two dupes.\"[13]/nMuch more detailed speculation based on these scant historical details has been interpolated by many of Galois's biographers, such as the frequently repeated speculation that the entire incident was stage-managed by the police and royalist factions to eliminate a political enemy.[citation needed]/nAs to his opponent in the duel, Alexandre Dumas names Pescheux d'Herbinville,[14] who was actually one of the nineteen artillery officers whose acquittal was celebrated at the banquet that occasioned Galois's first arrest.[21] However, Dumas is alone in this assertion, and if he were correct it is unclear why d'Herbinville would have been involved. It has been speculated that he was Poterin du Motel's \"supposed fianc\u00e9\" at the time (she ultimately married someone else), but no clear evidence has been found supporting this conjecture. On the other hand, extant newspaper clippings from only a few days after the duel give a description of his opponent (identified by the initials \"L.D.\") that appear to more accurately apply to one of Galois's Republican friends, most probably Ernest Duchatelet, who was imprisoned with Galois on the same charges.[22] Given the conflicting information available, the true identity of his killer may well be lost to history./nWhatever the reasons behind the duel, Galois was so convinced of his impending death that he stayed up all night writing letters to his Republican friends and composing what would become his mathematical testament, the famous letter to Auguste Chevalier outlining his ideas, and three attached manuscripts.[23] Mathematician Hermann Weyl said of this testament, \"This letter, if judged by the novelty and profundity of ideas it contains, is perhaps the most substantial piece of writing in the whole literature of mankind.\" However, the legend of Galois pouring his mathematical thoughts onto paper the night before he died seems to have been exaggerated.[8] In these final papers, he outlined the rough edges of some work he had been doing in analysis and annotated a copy of the manuscript submitted to the Academy and other papers./nEarly in the morning of 30 May 1832, he was shot in the abdomen,[18] was abandoned by his opponents and his own seconds, and was found by a passing farmer. He died the following morning[18] at ten o'clock in the H\u00f4pital Cochin (probably of peritonitis), after refusing the offices of a priest. His funeral ended in riots.[18] There were plans to initiate an uprising during his funeral, but during the same time the leaders heard of General Jean Maximilien Lamarque's death and the rising was postponed without any uprising occurring until 5 June. Only Galois's younger brother was notified of the events prior to Galois's death.[24] Galois was 20 years old. His last words to his younger brother Alfred were:/n\"Ne pleure pas, Alfred\u00a0! J'ai besoin de tout mon courage pour mourir \u00e0 vingt ans\u00a0!\"(Don't weep, Alfred! I need all my courage to die at twenty!)/nOn 2 June, \u00c9variste Galois was buried in a common grave of the Montparnasse Cemetery whose exact location is unknown.[18][16] In the cemetery of his native town \u2013 Bourg-la-Reine \u2013 a cenotaph in his honour was erected beside the graves of his relatives.[25]/n\u00c9variste Galois died in 1832. Joseph Liouville began studying Galois's unpublished papers in 1842 and acknowledged their value in 1843. It is not clear what happened in the 10 years between 1832 and 1842 nor what eventually inspired Joseph Liouville to begin reading Galois's papers. Jesper L\u00fctzen explores this subject at some length in Chapter XIV Galois Theory of his book about Joseph Liouville without reaching any definitive conclusions.[26]/nIt is certainly possible that mathematicians (including Liouville) did not want to publicize Galois's papers because Galois was a republican political activist who died 5 days before the June Rebellion, an unsuccessful anti-monarchist insurrection of Parisian republicans. In Galois's obituary, his friend Auguste Chevalier almost accused academicians at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique of having killed Galois since, if they had not rejected his work, he would have become a mathematician and would not have devoted himself to the republican political activism for which some believed he was killed.[26]/nGiven that France was still living in the shadow of the Reign of Terror and the Napoleonic era, Liouville might have waited until the June Rebellion's political turmoil subsided before turning his attention to Galois's papers.[26]/nLiouville finally published Galois's manuscripts in the October\u2013November 1846 issue of the Journal de Math\u00e9matiques Pures et Appliqu\u00e9es.[27][28] Galois's most famous contribution was a novel proof that there is no quintic formula \u2013 that is, that fifth and higher degree equations are not generally solvable by radicals. Although Niels Henrik Abel had already proved the impossibility of a \"quintic formula\" by radicals in 1824 and Paolo Ruffini had published a solution in 1799 that turned out to be flawed, Galois's methods led to deeper research into what is now called Galois Theory, which  can be used to determine, for any polynomial equation, whether it has a solution by radicals./nFrom the closing lines of a letter from Galois to his friend Auguste Chevalier, dated 29 May 1832, two days before Galois's death:[23]/nTu prieras publiquement Jacobi ou Gauss de donner leur avis, non sur la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, mais sur l'importance des th\u00e9or\u00e8mes./nApr\u00e8s cela, il y aura, j'esp\u00e8re, des gens qui trouveront leur profit \u00e0 d\u00e9chiffrer tout ce g\u00e2chis./n(Ask Jacobi or Gauss publicly to give their opinion, not as to the truth, but as to the importance of these theorems. Later there will be, I hope, some people who will find it to their advantage to decipher all this mess.)/nWithin the 60 or so pages of Galois's collected works are many important ideas that have had far-reaching consequences for nearly all branches of mathematics.[29][30] \nHis work has been compared to that of Niels Henrik Abel (1802\u20131829), a contemporary mathematician who also died at a very young age, and much of their work had significant overlap./nWhile many mathematicians before Galois gave consideration to what are now known as groups, it was Galois who was the first to use the word group (in French groupe) in a sense close to the technical sense that is understood today, making him among the founders of the branch of algebra known as group theory. He called the decomposition of a group into its left and right cosets a proper decomposition if the left and right cosets coincide, which is what today is known as a normal subgroup.[23] He also introduced the concept of a finite field (also known as a Galois field in his honor) in essentially the same form as it is understood today.[12]/nIn his last letter to Chevalier[23] and attached manuscripts, the second of three, he made basic studies of linear groups over finite fields:/nGalois's most significant contribution to mathematics is his development of Galois theory. He realized that the algebraic solution to a polynomial equation is related to the structure of a group of permutations associated with the roots of the polynomial, the Galois group of the polynomial. He found that an equation could be solved in radicals if one can find a series of subgroups of its Galois group, each one normal in its successor with abelian quotient, that is, its Galois group is solvable. This proved to be a fertile approach, which later mathematicians adapted to many other fields of mathematics besides the theory of equations to which Galois originally applied it.[29]/nGalois also made some contributions to the theory of Abelian integrals and continued fractions./nAs written in his last letter,[23] Galois passed from the study of elliptic functions to consideration of the integrals of the most general algebraic differentials, today called Abelian integrals. He classified these integrals into three categories./nIn his first paper in 1828,[7] Galois proved that the regular continued fraction which represents a quadratic surd \u03b6 is purely periodic if and only if \u03b6 is a reduced surd, that is, \n\n\n\n\u03b6\n>\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\zeta >1}\n\n and its conjugate \n\n\n\n\u03b7\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\eta }\n\n\nsatisfies \n\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n<\n\u03b7\n<\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle -1<\\eta <0}\n\n./nIn fact, Galois showed more than this. He also proved that if \u03b6 is a reduced quadratic surd and \u03b7 is its conjugate, then the continued fractions for \u03b6 and for (\u22121/\u03b7) are both purely periodic, and the repeating block in one of those continued fractions is the mirror image of the repeating block in the other. In symbols we have/nwhere \u03b6 is any reduced quadratic surd, and \u03b7 is its conjugate./nFrom these two theorems of Galois a result already known to Lagrange can be deduced. If r\u00a0>\u00a01 is a rational number that is not a perfect square, then/nIn particular, if n is any non-square positive integer, the regular continued fraction expansion of \u221an contains a repeating block of length m, in which the first m\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 partial denominators form a palindromic string.", "15771224": "Marion Kirkland \"Kirk\" Fort Jr. (1921\u20131964) was an American mathematician, specializing in general topology.

He is best known for writing The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices (Arabic: \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0646\u062f\u0633\u064a\u0629, romanized:\u00a0Kitab fi ma'rifat al-hiyal al-handasiya, lit.\u2009'Book in knowledge of engineering tricks') in 1206, where he described 50 mechanical devices, along with instructions on how to construct them. He is credited with the invention of the elephant clock.[3] He has been described as the \"father of robotics\" and modern day engineering.[4]/nAl-Jazari was born in the area of Upper Mesopotamia in 1136. Sources state his exact location is unknown, but they speculate he could have been born in Jazirat ibn Umar, where he got the name Jazari from or Al-Jazira which was used to denote Upper Mesopotamia.[5][6][7] The only biographical information known about him is contained in his Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices.[8] Like his father before him, he served as chief engineer at the Artuklu Palace, the residence of the Mardin branch of the Artuqids which ruled across Upper Mesopotamia as vassals of the Zengid dynasty of Mosul and later of Ayyubid general Saladin.[9] Little is known about his ethnic background, so he has been variously described as Arab,[10][11]:\u200a21\u200a[12][13] Kurdish[14] or Persian.[15]/nAl-Jazari was part of a tradition of artisans and was thus more a practical engineer than an inventor[16] who appears to have been \"more interested in the craftsmanship necessary to construct the devices than in the technology which lay behind them\" and his machines were usually \"assembled by trial and error rather than by theoretical calculation\".[17] His Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices appears to have been quite popular as it appears in a large number of manuscript copies, and as he explains repeatedly, he only describes devices he has built himself. According to Mayr, the book's style resembles that of a modern \"do-it-yourself\" book.[18]/nSome of his devices were inspired by earlier devices, such as one of his monumental water clocks, which was based on that of a Pseudo-Archimedes.[19] He also cites the influence of the Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 brothers for his fountains, al-Saghani for the design of a candle clock, and Hibatullah ibn al-Husayn (d. 1139) for musical automata. Al-Jazari goes on to describe the improvements he made to the work of his predecessors, and describes a number of devices, techniques and components that are original innovations which do not appear in the works by his precessors.[11]:\u200a21\u201322/nThe most significant aspect of al-Jazari's machines are the mechanisms, components, ideas, methods, and design features which they employ.[9]/nA camshaft, a shaft to which cams are attached, was described in 1206 by al-Jazari, who employed them in his automata,[20] water clocks (such as the candle clock)[21] and water-raising machines.[20]/nThe eccentrically mounted handle of the rotary quern-stone in fifth century BCE Spain that spread across the Roman Empire constitutes a crank.[22] The earliest evidence of a crank and connecting rod mechanism dates to the 3rd century AD Hierapolis sawmill in the Roman Empire.[22] The crank also appears in the mid-9th century in several of the hydraulic devices described by the Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 brothers in their Book of Ingenious Devices.[23]/nIn 1206, al-Jazari invented an early crankshaft,[24][25] which he incorporated with a crank-connecting rod mechanism in his twin-cylinder pump.[26] Like the modern crankshaft, al-Jazari's mechanism consisted of a wheel setting several crankpins into motion, with the wheel's motion being circular and the pins moving back-and-forth in a straight line.[24] The crankshaft described by al-Jazari[24][25] transforms continuous rotary motion into a linear reciprocating motion,[26] and is central to modern machinery such as the steam engine, internal combustion engine and automatic controls.[25][27]/nHe used the crankshaft with a connecting rod in two of his water-raising machines: the crank-driven saqiya chain pump and the double-action reciprocating piston suction pump.[26][28] His water pump also employed the first known crank-slider mechanism.[8]/nEnglish technology historian Donald Hill writes:/nWe see for the first time in al-Jazari's work several concepts important for both design and construction: the lamination of timber to minimize warping, the static balancing of wheels, the use of wooden templates (a kind of pattern), the use of paper models to establish designs, the calibration of orifices, the grinding of the seats and plugs of valves together with emery powder to obtain a watertight fit, and the casting of metals in closed mold boxes with sand.[9]/nAl-Jazari invented a method for controlling the speed of rotation of a wheel using an escapement mechanism.[29]/nAccording to Donald Hill, al-Jazari described several early mechanical controls, including \"a large metal door, a combination lock and a lock with four bolts\".[9]/nA segmental gear is \"a piece for receiving or communicating reciprocating motion from or to a cogwheel, consisting of a sector of a circular gear, or ring, having cogs on the periphery, or face.\"[30] Professor Lynn Townsend White, Jr. wrote:/nSegmental gears first clearly appear in al-Jazari, in the West they emerge in Giovanni de Dondi's astronomical clock finished in 1364, and only with the great Sienese engineer Francesco di Giorgio (1501) did they enter the general vocabulary of European machine design.[31]/nAl-Jazari invented five machines for raising water,[1] as well as watermills and water wheels with cams on their axle used to operate automata,[32] in the 12th and 13th centuries, and described them in 1206. It was in these water-raising machines that he introduced his most important ideas and components./nThe first known use of a crankshaft in a chain pump was in one of al-Jazari's saqiya machines. The concept of minimizing intermittent working is also first implied in one of al-Jazari's saqiya chain pumps, which was for the purpose of maximising the efficiency of the saqiya chain pump. Al-Jazari also constructed a water-raising saqiya chain pump which was run by hydropower rather than manual labour, though the Chinese were also using hydropower for chain pumps prior to him. Saqiya machines like the ones he described have been supplying water in Damascus since the 13th century up until modern times,[33] and were in everyday use throughout the medieval Islamic world.[34]\nInterestingly, the depiction of the chain in al-Jazari's pump appears to be in the form of a M\u00f6bius strip, from long before the M\u00f6bius strip was first identified as an object of study in mathematics.[35]/nCiting the Byzantine siphon used for discharging Greek fire as an inspiration,[36] al-Jazari went on to describe his version of suction pipes, suction pump, double-action pump, and made early uses of valves and a crankshaft-connecting rod mechanism, when he developed a twin-cylinder reciprocating piston suction pump. This pump is driven by a water wheel, which drives, through a system of gears, an oscillating slot-rod to which the rods of two pistons are attached. The pistons work in horizontally opposed cylinders, each provided with valve-operated suction and delivery pipes. The delivery pipes are joined above the centre of the machine to form a single outlet into the irrigation system. This water-raising machine had a direct significance for the development of modern engineering. This pump is remarkable for three reasons:[9][37][38][39]/nAl-Jazari's suction piston pump could lift 13.6 metres of water,[citation needed] with the help of delivery pipes. It was not, however, any more efficient than the noria commonly used by the Muslim world at the time.[40]/nal-Jazari developed the earliest water supply system to be driven by gears and hydropower, which was built in 13th century Damascus to supply water to its mosques and Bimaristan hospitals. The system had water from a lake turn a scoop-wheel and a system of gears which transported jars of water up to a water channel that led to mosques and hospitals in the city.[41]/nAl-Jazari built automated moving peacocks driven by hydropower.[42] He also created automatic doors as part of one of his elaborate water clocks,[9] and invented water wheels with cams on their axle used to operate automata.[32] According to Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, the Italian Renaissance inventor Leonardo da Vinci may have been influenced by the classic automata of al-Jazari.[43]/nMark E. Rosheim summarizes the advances in robotics made by Muslim engineers, especially al-Jazari, as follows:/nUnlike the Greek designs, these Arab examples reveal an interest, not only in dramatic illusion, but in manipulating the environment for human comfort. Thus, the greatest contribution the Arabs made, besides preserving, disseminating and building on the work of the Greeks, was the concept of practical application. This was the key element that was missing in Greek robotic science.[44]/nThe Arabs, on the other hand, displayed an interest in creating human-like machines for practical purposes but lacked, like other preindustrial societies, any real impetus to pursue their robotic science.[45]/nOne of al-Jazari's humanoid automata was a waitress that could serve water, tea or drinks. The drink was stored in a tank with a reservoir from where the drink drips into a bucket and, after seven minutes, into a cup, after which the waitress appears out of an automatic door serving the drink.[46]/nAl-Jazari invented a hand washing automaton incorporating a flush mechanism now used in modern flush toilets. This device is another example of humanoid automata. It consisted of a human figure, made from jointed copper, holding a pitcher resembling a peacock in its right hand. The pitcher is made from brass and holds within it a chamber, divided into two parts by a metal plate. This mechanism aided the pouring of the water from the spout so that it was smooth and would not splutter. The reservoir in which the water is held is situated within the right-hand side of the human figure. An axle is fitted into the right elbow of the human figure so as to allow the liquid to pour from the reservoir through the spout of the pitcher. The left arm of the figure had a fixed weight which would raise and lower the arm which would hold a towel, comb and mirror./nThis automaton was designed to aid the king whilst he performed his ritual ablutions. A servant of the king would carry the figure and place it next to a basin that could hold liquid. The servant then turned a knob on the back of the figure which opened a valve resulting in the pouring of water from the right hand of the figure into the basin. When the reservoir is nearly empty and most of the water has been poured a mechanism is prompted and the left hand of the figure, holding the towel, comb and mirror, is extended out in the direction of the king so that he can dry himself and tend to his beard.[47]/nWater and its usages holds particular importance in Islam; both as being an integral part of the pre-prayer washing processes wudu and ghusl, and a key feature in Islamic gardens \u2013 four fountains featuring in the Paradise Garden; the Islamic final resting place referenced in the Quran. Additionally, with Mesopotamia being a naturally drought-ridden place, machines relating to water held a significant function; in both a divine and practical sense./nAn entire section of The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices was devoted to fountain mechanisms, titled: \u2018On the construction in pools of fountains which change their shape, and of machines for the perpetual flute\u2019.[48]/nAl-Jazari's \"peacock fountain\" was a more sophisticated hand washing device featuring humanoid automata as servants which offer soap and towels. Mark E. Rosheim describes it as follows:[44]/nPulling a plug on the peacock's tail releases water out of the beak; as the dirty water from the basin fills the hollow base a float rises and actuates a linkage which makes a servant figure appear from behind a door under the peacock and offer soap. When more water is used, a second float at a higher level trips and causes the appearance of a second servant figure \u2013 with a towel!/nThe basin of the \"peacock fountain\" formed the basin for performing wudu, and it would have been operated by a servant, who would have pulled the plug and positioned the peacock's beak; allowing the mechanism to release the water into the basin in front of the user.[49]/nHowever, whilst water moving objects such as the peacock fountain had ritualistic usage, there is suggestion that water-moving hydraulics were put to profane use. Ayhan Aytes suggests that:[50]/nMany of the devices also had additional functions that contradicted divine omnipotence. The most profane purpose of several of his hydraulic and pnuematic automata was to get guests at parties drunk as quickly as possible./nAl-Jazari's work described fountains and musical automata, in which the flow of water alternated from one large tank to another at hourly or half-hourly intervals. This operation was achieved through his innovative use of hydraulic switching.[9]/nAl-Jazari created a musical automaton, which was a boat with four automatic musicians that floated on a lake to entertain guests at royal drinking parties. Professor Noel Sharkey has argued that it is quite likely that it was an early programmable automata and has produced a possible reconstruction of the mechanism; it has a programmable drum machine with pegs (cams) that bump into little levers that operated the percussion. The drummer could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns if the pegs were moved around.[51]/nThe water-clock of the drummers, which differs from the Musical robot band in that it lacks a flute-playing doll and instead has two trumpeters, consists of seven wood-jointed male figures, including the aforementioned trumpeters as well as two dolls playing cymbals and the rest playing other percussive instruments.[52] The mechanism in this specific automaton serves as a clock by producing a musical output once every hour, illustrating Al-Jazari\u2019s ability to create multi-faceted automata that functioned on a practical and entertainment level. The motion of the automaton is initiated at daybreak by another male doll, who stands at the edge of the frieze element of the design, moving across until he reaches a specific point at which a carved falcon leans forward dropping a ball from its beak onto a cymbal.[53] All mechanical aspects of the automaton are then driven by water and a series of pistons and cables. Each hour water drains out of the main cistern to cause another bucket to tip over driving a water wheel that is connected to the musicians. The automaton is described to \u2018perform a with a clamorous sound which is heard from afar\u2019 and could play several different tunes.[54] Like many other automatons by Al-Jazari, this was created to entertain guests at the royal palace./nAl-Jazari constructed a variety of water clocks and candle clocks. These included a portable water-powered scribe clock, which was a meter high and half a meter wide, reconstructed successfully at the Science Museum in 1976[32][55] Al-Jazari also invented monumental water-powered astronomical clocks which displayed moving models of the Sun, Moon, and stars./nAccording to Donald Hill, al-Jazari constructed the most sophisticated candle clocks known to date. Hill described one of al-Jazari's candle clocks as follows:[9]/nThe candle, whose rate of burning was known, bore against the underside of the cap, and its wick passed through the hole. Wax collected in the indentation and could be removed periodically so that it did not interfere with steady burning. The bottom of the candle rested in a shallow dish that had a ring on its side connected through pulleys to a counterweight. As the candle burned away, the weight pushed it upward at a constant speed. The automata were operated from the dish at the bottom of the candle. No other candle clocks of this sophistication are known./nAl-Jazari's candle clock also included a dial to display the time and, for the first time, employed a bayonet fitting, a fastening mechanism still used in modern times.[56]/nThe elephant clock described by al-Jazari in 1206 is notable for several innovations. It was the first clock in which an automaton reacted after certain intervals of time (in this case, a humanoid robot striking the cymbal and a mechanical robotic bird chirping) and the first water clock to accurately record the passage of the temporal hours to match the uneven length of days throughout the year.[57]/nAl-Jazari's largest astronomical clock was the \"castle clock\", which was a complex device that was about 11 feet (3.4\u00a0m) high, and had multiple functions besides timekeeping. It included a display of the zodiac and the solar and lunar orbits, and an innovative feature of the device was a pointer in the shape of the crescent moon which travelled across the top of a gateway, moved by a hidden cart, and caused automatic doors to open, each revealing a mannequin, every hour.[9][58]/nAnother feature of the device was five automata musicians who automatically play music when moved by levers operated by a hidden camshaft attached to a water wheel.[21]/nAl-Jazari invented water clocks that were driven by both water and weights. These included geared clocks and a portable water-powered scribe clock, which was a meter high and half a meter wide. The scribe with his pen was synonymous to the hour hand of a modern clock.[32][55] Al-Jazari's famous water-powered scribe clock was reconstructed successfully at the Science Museum, London in 1976./nAlongside his accomplishments as an inventor and engineer, al-Jazari was also an accomplished artist.

John Wallis was a contemporary of Newton and one of the greatest intellectuals of the early renaissance of mathematics.[5]/nOn 14 March 1645 he married Susanna Glynde (c.\u20091600 \u2013 16 March 1687). They had three children:/nJohn Wallis was born in Ashford, Kent. He was the third of five children of Reverend John Wallis and Joanna Chapman. He was initially educated at a school in Ashford but moved to James Movat's school in Tenterden in 1625 following an outbreak of plague. Wallis was first exposed to mathematics in 1631, at Felsted School (then known as Martin Holbeach's school in Felsted); he enjoyed maths, but his study was erratic, since \"mathematics, at that time with us, were scarce looked on as academical studies, but rather mechanical\" (Scriba 1970). At the school in Felsted, Wallis learned how to speak and write Latin. By this time, he also was proficient in French, Greek, and Hebrew.[9] As it was intended he should be a doctor, he was sent in 1632 to Emmanuel College, Cambridge.[10] While there, he kept an act on the doctrine of the circulation of the blood; that was said to have been the first occasion in Europe on which this theory was publicly maintained in a disputation. His interests, however, centred on mathematics. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1637 and a Master's in 1640, afterwards entering the priesthood. From 1643 to 1649, he served as a nonvoting scribe at the Westminster Assembly. He was elected to a fellowship at Queens' College, Cambridge in 1644, from which he had to resign following his marriage./nThroughout this time, Wallis had been close to the Parliamentarian party, perhaps as a result of his exposure to Holbeach at Felsted School. He rendered them great practical assistance in deciphering Royalist dispatches. The quality of cryptography at that time was mixed; despite the individual successes of mathematicians such as Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te, the principles underlying cipher design and analysis were very poorly understood. Most ciphers were ad hoc methods relying on a secret algorithm, as opposed to systems based on a variable key. Wallis realised that the latter were far more secure \u2013 even describing them as \"unbreakable\", though he was not confident enough in this assertion to encourage revealing cryptographic algorithms. He was also concerned about the use of ciphers by foreign powers, refusing, for example, Gottfried Leibniz's request of 1697 to teach Hanoverian students about cryptography.[11]/nReturning to London \u2013 he had been made chaplain at St Gabriel Fenchurch in 1643 \u2013 Wallis joined the group of scientists that was later to evolve into the Royal Society. He was finally able to indulge his mathematical interests, mastering William Oughtred's Clavis Mathematicae in a few weeks in 1647. He soon began to write his own treatises, dealing with a wide range of topics, which he continued for the rest of his life. Wallis wrote the first survey about mathematical concepts in England where he discussed the Hindu-Arabic system.[12]/nWallis joined the moderate Presbyterians in signing the remonstrance against the execution of Charles I, by which he incurred the lasting hostility of the Independents. In spite of their opposition he was appointed in 1649 to the Savilian Chair of Geometry at Oxford University, where he lived until his death on 8 November\u00a0[O.S. 28 October]\u00a01703. In 1650, Wallis was ordained as a minister. After, he spent two years with Sir Richard Darley and Lady Vere as a private chaplain. In 1661, he was one of twelve Presbyterian representatives at the Savoy Conference./nBesides his mathematical works he wrote on theology, logic, English grammar and philosophy, and he was involved in devising a system for teaching a deaf boy to speak at Littlecote House.[13] William Holder had earlier taught a deaf man, Alexander Popham, to speak \"plainly and distinctly, and with a good and graceful tone\".[14] Wallis later claimed credit for this, leading Holder to accuse Wallis of \"rifling his Neighbours, and adorning himself with their spoyls\".[15]/nThe Parliamentary visitation of Oxford, that began in 1647, removed many senior academics from their positions, including in November 1648, the Savilian Professors of Geometry and Astronomy. In 1649 Wallis was appointed as Savilian Professor of Geometry. Wallis seems to have been chosen largely on political grounds (as perhaps had been his Royalist predecessor Peter Turner, who despite his appointment to two professorships never published any mathematical works); while Wallis was perhaps the nation's leading cryptographer and was part of an informal group of scientists that would later become the Royal Society, he had no particular reputation as a mathematician. Nonetheless, Wallis' appointment proved richly justified by his subsequent work during the 54 years he served as Savilian Professor.[16]/nWallis made significant contributions to trigonometry, calculus, geometry, and the analysis of infinite series. In his Opera Mathematica I (1695) he introduced the term \"continued fraction\"./nIn 1655, Wallis published a treatise on conic sections in which they were defined analytically. This was the earliest book in which these curves are considered and defined as curves of the second degree. It helped to remove some of the perceived difficulty and obscurity of Ren\u00e9 Descartes' work on analytic geometry.\nIn the Treatise on the Conic Sections Wallis popularised the symbol \u221e for infinity. He wrote, \"I suppose any plane (following the Geometry of Indivisibles of Cavalieri) to be made up of an infinite number of parallel lines, or as I would prefer, of an infinite number of parallelograms of the same altitude; (let the altitude of each one of these be an infinitely small part 1/\u221e of the whole altitude, and let the symbol \u221e denote Infinity) and the altitude of all to make up the altitude of the figure.\"[17]/nArithmetica Infinitorum, the most important of Wallis's works, was published in 1656. In this treatise the methods of analysis of Descartes and Cavalieri were systematised and extended, but some ideas were open to criticism. He began, after a short tract on conic sections, by developing the standard notation for powers, extending them from positive integers to rational numbers:/nLeaving the numerous algebraic applications of this discovery, he next proceeded to find, by integration, the area enclosed between the curve y = xm, x-axis, and any ordinate x = h, and he proved that the ratio of this area to that of the parallelogram on the same base and of the same height is 1/(m\u00a0+\u20091), extending Cavalieri's quadrature formula. He apparently assumed that the same result would be true also for the curve y = axm, where a is any constant, and m any number positive or negative, but he discussed only the case of the parabola in which m = 2 and the hyperbola in which m = \u22121. In the latter case, his interpretation of the result is incorrect. He then showed that similar results may be written down for any curve of the form/nand hence that, if the ordinate y of a curve can be expanded in powers of x, its area can be determined: thus he says that if the equation of the curve is y = x0 + x1 + x2 + ..., its area would be x + x2/2 + x3/3 + ...\u2009. He then applied this to the quadrature of the curves y = (x \u2212 x2)0, y = (x \u2212 x2)1, y = (x \u2212 x2)2, etc., taken between the limits x\u00a0=\u00a00 and x\u00a0=\u00a01. He shows that the areas are, respectively, 1, 1/6, 1/30, 1/140, etc. He next considered curves of the form y = x1/m and established the theorem that the area bounded by this curve and the lines x\u00a0=\u00a00 and x\u00a0=\u00a01 is equal to the area of the rectangle on the same base and of the same altitude as m\u00a0: m\u00a0+\u20091. This is equivalent to computing/nHe illustrated this by the parabola, in which case m = 2. He stated, but did not prove, the corresponding result for a curve of the form y = xp/q./nWallis showed considerable ingenuity in reducing the equations of curves to the forms given above, but, as he was unacquainted with the binomial theorem, he could not effect the quadrature of the circle, whose equation is \n\n\n\ny\n=\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y={\\sqrt {1-x^{2}}}}\n\n, since he was unable to expand this in powers of x. He laid down, however, the principle of interpolation. Thus, as the ordinate of the circle \n\n\n\ny\n=\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y={\\sqrt {1-x^{2}}}}\n\n is the geometrical mean of the ordinates of the curves \n\n\n\ny\n=\n(\n1\n\u2212\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n\n)\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y=(1-x^{2})^{0}}\n\n and \n\n\n\ny\n=\n(\n1\n\u2212\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n\n)\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y=(1-x^{2})^{1}}\n\n, it might be supposed that, as an approximation, the area of the semicircle \n\n\n\n\n\u222b\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nd\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\int _{0}^{1}\\!{\\sqrt {1-x^{2}}}\\,dx}\n\n which is \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n4\n\n\n\n\u03c0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {1}{4}}\\pi }\n\n might be taken as the geometrical mean of the values of/nthat is, \n\n\n\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {2}{3}}}\n\n; this is equivalent to taking \n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 4{\\sqrt {\\tfrac {2}{3}}}}\n\n or 3.26... as the value of \u03c0. But, Wallis argued, we have in fact a series \n\n\n\n1\n,\n\n\n\n1\n6\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n1\n30\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n1\n140\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1,{\\tfrac {1}{6}},{\\tfrac {1}{30}},{\\tfrac {1}{140}},}\n\n... and therefore the term interpolated between \n\n\n\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {1}{6}}}\n\n ought to be chosen so as to obey the law of this series.[clarification needed] This, by an elaborate method that is not described here in detail, leads to a value for the interpolated term which is equivalent to taking/n(which is now known as the Wallis product)./nIn this work also the formation and properties of continued fractions are discussed, the subject having been brought into prominence by Brouncker's use of these fractions./nA few years later, in 1659, Wallis published a tract containing the solution of the problems on the cycloid which had been proposed by Blaise Pascal. In this he incidentally explained how the principles laid down in his Arithmetica Infinitorum could be used for the rectification of algebraic curves and gave a solution of the problem to rectify (i.e., find the length of) the semicubical parabola x3 = ay2, which had been discovered in 1657 by his pupil William Neile. Since all attempts to rectify the ellipse and hyperbola had been (necessarily) ineffectual, it had been supposed that no curves could be rectified, as indeed Descartes had definitely asserted to be the case. The logarithmic spiral had been rectified by Evangelista Torricelli and was the first curved line (other than the circle) whose length was determined, but the extension by Neile and Wallis to an algebraic curve was novel. The cycloid was the next curve rectified; this was done by Christopher Wren in 1658./nEarly in 1658 a similar discovery, independent of that of Neile, was made by van Heura\u00ebt, and this was published by van Schooten in his edition of Descartes's Geometria in 1659. Van Heura\u00ebt's method is as follows. He supposes the curve to be referred to rectangular axes; if this is so, and if (x, y) are the coordinates of any point on it, and n is the length of the normal,[clarification needed] and if another point whose coordinates are (x, \u03b7) is taken such that \u03b7\u00a0: h = n\u00a0: y, where h is a constant; then, if ds is the element of the length of the required curve, we have by similar triangles ds\u00a0: dx = n\u00a0: y. Therefore, h ds = \u03b7 dx. Hence, if the area of the locus of the point (x, \u03b7) can be found, the first curve can be rectified. In this way van Heura\u00ebt effected the rectification of the curve y3 = ax2 but added that the rectification of the parabola y2 = ax is impossible since it requires the quadrature of the hyperbola. The solutions given by Neile and Wallis are somewhat similar to that given by van Heura\u00ebt, though no general rule is enunciated, and the analysis is clumsy. A third method was suggested by Fermat in 1660, but it is inelegant and laborious./nThe theory of the collision of bodies was propounded by the Royal Society in 1668 for the consideration of mathematicians. Wallis, Christopher Wren, and Christiaan Huygens sent correct and similar solutions, all depending on what is now called the conservation of momentum; but, while Wren and Huygens confined their theory to perfectly elastic bodies (elastic collision), Wallis considered also imperfectly elastic bodies (inelastic collision). This was followed in 1669 by a work on statics (centres of gravity), and in 1670 by one on dynamics: these provide a convenient synopsis of what was then known on the subject./nIn 1685 Wallis published Algebra, preceded by a historical account of the development of the subject, which contains a great deal of valuable information. The second edition, issued in 1693 and forming the second volume of his Opera, was considerably enlarged. This algebra is noteworthy as containing the first systematic use of formulae. A given magnitude is here represented by the numerical ratio which it bears to the unit of the same kind of magnitude: thus, when Wallis wants to compare two lengths he regards each as containing so many units of length. This perhaps will be made clearer by noting that the relation between the space described in any time by a particle moving with a uniform velocity is denoted by Wallis by the formula/nwhere s is the number representing the ratio of the space described to the unit of length; while the previous writers would have denoted the same relation by stating what is equivalent to the proposition/nWallis has been credited as the originator of the number line \"for negative quantities\"[18] and \"for operational purposes.\"[19] This is based on a passage in his 1685 treatise on algebra in which he introduced a number line to illustrate the legitimacy of negative quantities:[20]/nYet is not that Supposition (of Negative Quantities) either Unuseful or Absurd; when rightly understood. And though, as to the bare Algebraick Notation, it import a Quantity less than nothing: Yet, when it comes to a Physical Application, it denotes as Real a Quantity as if the Sign were \n\n\n\n+\n\n\n{\\displaystyle +}\n\n; but to be interpreted in a contrary sense... \n\n\n\n+\n3\n\n\n{\\displaystyle +3}\n\n, signifies \n\n\n\n3\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 3}\n\n Yards Forward; and \n\n\n\n\u2212\n3\n\n\n{\\displaystyle -3}\n\n, signifies \n\n\n\n3\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 3}\n\n Yards Backward./nIt has also been noted that, in an earlier work, Wallis came to the conclusion that the ratio of a positive number to a negative one is greater than infinity. The argument involves the quotient \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {1}{x}}}\n\n and considering what happens as \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n approaches and then crosses the point \n\n\n\nx\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x=0}\n\n from the positive side.[21] Wallis was not alone in this thinking: Leonhard Euler came to the same conclusion by considering the geometric series \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\u2212\nx\n\n\n\n\n=\n1\n+\nx\n+\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\u22ef\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {1}{1-x}}=1+x+x^{2}+\\cdots }\n\n, evaluated at \n\n\n\nx\n=\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x=2}\n\n, followed by reasoning similar to Wallis's (he resolved the paradox by distinguishing different kinds of negative numbers).[18]/nHe is usually credited with the proof of the Pythagorean theorem using similar triangles. However, Thabit Ibn Qurra (AD 901), an Arab mathematician, had produced a generalisation of the Pythagorean theorem applicable to all triangles six centuries earlier. It is a reasonable conjecture that Wallis was aware of Thabit's work.[22]/nWallis was also inspired by the works of Islamic mathematician Sadr al-Tusi, the son of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, particularly by al-Tusi's book written in 1298 on the parallel postulate. The book was based on his father's thoughts and presented one of the earliest arguments for a non-Euclidean hypothesis equivalent to the parallel postulate. After reading this, Wallis then wrote about his ideas as he developed his own thoughts about the postulate, trying to prove it also with similar triangles.[23]/nHe found that Euclid's fifth postulate is equivalent to the one currently named  \"Wallis postulate\" after him. This postulate states that \"On a given finite straight line it is always possible to construct a triangle similar to a given triangle\". This result was encompassed in a trend trying to deduce Euclid's fifth from the other four postulates which today is known to be impossible. Unlike other authors, he realised that the unbounded growth of a triangle was not guaranteed by the four first postulates.[24]/nAnother aspect of Wallis's mathematical skills was his ability to do mental calculations. He slept badly and often did mental calculations as he lay awake in his bed. One night he calculated in his head the square root of a number with 53 digits. In the morning he dictated the 27-digit square root of the number, still entirely from memory. It was a feat that was considered remarkable, and Henry Oldenburg, the Secretary of the Royal Society, sent a colleague to investigate how Wallis did it. It was considered important enough to merit discussion in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of 1685.[25][26]/nWallis translated into Latin works of Ptolemy and Bryennius, and Porphyrius's commentary on Ptolemy.  He also published three letters to Henry Oldenburg concerning tuning. He approved of equal temperament, which was being used in England's organs.[27]/nHis Institutio logicae, published in 1687, was very popular.[4] The Grammatica linguae Anglicanae was a work on English grammar, that remained in print well into the eighteenth century. He also published on theology.[4]/nWhile employed as lady Vere's chaplain in 1642 Wallis was given an enciphered letter about the fall of Chicester which he managed to decipher within two hours. This started his career as a cryptographer. He was a moderate suporter of the Parliamentarian side in the First English Civil War and therefore worked as a decipherer of intercepted correspondence for the Parliamentarian leaders. For his services he was rewarded with the Livings of St. Gabriel and St. Martin's in London.[28]/nBecause of his Parliamentarian sympathies Wallis was not employed as a cryptographer after the Stuart Restoration,[29] but after the Glorious Revolution he was sought out by lord Nottingham and frequently employed to decipher encrypted intercepted correspondence, though he thought that he was not always adequately rewarded for his work.[a] King William III from 1689 also employed Wallis as a cryptographer, sometimes almost on a daily basis. Couriers would bring him letters to be decrypted, and waited in front of his study for the product. The king took a personal interest in Wallis' work and well-being as witnessed by a letter he sent to Dutch Grand pensionary Anthonie Heinsius in 1689.[29]/nIn these early days of the Williamite reign directly obtaining foreign intercepted letters was a problem for the English, as they did not have the resources of foreign Black Chambers as yet, but allies like the Elector of Brandenburg without their own Black Chambers occasionally made gifts of such intercepted correspondence, like the letter of king Louis XIV of France to king John III Sobieski of Poland that king William in 1689 used to cause a crisis in French-Polish diplomatic relations. He was quite open about it and Wallis was rewarded for his role.[31] But Wallis became nervous that the French might take action against him.[32]/nWallis relationship with the German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was cordial. But Leibniz also had cryptographic interests and tried to get Wallis to divulge some of his trade secrets, which Wallis declined to do as a matter of patriotic principle.[33]/nSmith gives an example of the painstaking work that Wallis performed, as described by himself in a letter to Richard Hampden of 3 August 1689. In it he gives a detailed account of his work on a particular letter and the parts he had encountered difficulties with.[34]/nWallis' correspondence also shows details of the way he stood up for himself, when he thought he was under-appreciated, financially or otherwise. He lobbied enthusiastically, both on his own behalf, and that of his relatives, as witnessed by letters to Lord Nottingham, Richard Hampden and the MP Harbord Harbord that Smith quotes.[35] In a letter to the English envoy to Prussia, James Johnston Wallis bitterly complains that a courtier of the Prussian Elector, by the name of Smetteau, had done him wrong in the matter of just compensation for services rendered to the Elector. In the letter he gives details of what he had done, and gives advice on a simple substitution cipher for the use of Johnston himself.[36]/nWallis' contributions to the art of cryptography were not only of a \"technological\" character. De Leeuw points out that even the \"purely scientific\" contributions of Wallis to the science of linguistics in the field of the \"rationality\" of Natural language as it developed over time, played a role in the development of cryptology as a science. Wallis' development of a model of English grammar, independent of earlier models based on Latin grammar, is a case in point of the way other sciences helped develop cryptology in his view.[37]/nWallis tried to teach his own son John, and his grandson by his daughter Anne, William Blencowe the tricks of the trade. With William he was so successful that he could persuade the government to allow the grandson to get the survivorship of the annual pension of \u00a3100  Wallis had received in compensation for his cryptographic work.[38]/nWilliam Blencowe eventually succeeded Wallis as official Cryptographer to Queen Anne after Wallis' death in 1703.[39]", "23570107": "Isador Mitchell Sheffer (October 15, 1901\u2013April 20, 1992) was an American mathematician best known for the Sheffer sequence of polynomials.[1] Born in Massachusetts, he lived a large portion of his life in State College, Pennsylvania, where he was a Professor of Mathematics at Pennsylvania State University./nHe received his PhD from Harvard University in 1927, under the direction of George Birkhoff.[2]/n/nThis article about an American mathematician is a stub.

Al-Kindi was the first of the Islamic peripatetic philosophers, and is hailed as the \"father of Arab philosophy\".[3][4][5]/nAl-Kindi was born in Kufa and educated in Baghdad.[6] He became a prominent figure in the House of Wisdom, and a number of Abbasid Caliphs appointed him to oversee the translation of Greek scientific and philosophical texts into the Arabic language. This contact with \"the philosophy of the ancients\" (as Hellenistic philosophy was often referred to by Muslim scholars) had a profound effect on him, as he synthesized, adapted and promoted Hellenistic and Peripatetic philosophy in the Muslim world.[7] He subsequently wrote hundreds of original treatises of his own on a range of subjects ranging from metaphysics, ethics, logic and psychology, to medicine, pharmacology,[8] mathematics, astronomy, astrology and optics, and further afield to more practical topics like perfumes, swords, jewels, glass, dyes, zoology, tides, mirrors, meteorology and earthquakes.[9][10]/nIn the field of mathematics, al-Kindi played an important role in introducing Hindu numerals to the Islamic world, and their further development into Arabic numerals along with al-Khwarizmi which eventually was adopted by the rest of the world.[11] Al-Kindi was also one of the fathers of cryptography.[12][13] Building on the work of al-Khalil (717\u2013786),[14] Al-Kindi's book entitled Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages gave rise to the birth of cryptanalysis, was the earliest known use of statistical inference,[15] and introduced several new methods of breaking ciphers, notably frequency analysis.[16][17] He was able to create a scale that would enable doctors to gauge the effectiveness of their medication by combining his knowledge of mathematics and medicine.[18]/nThe central theme underpinning al-Kindi's philosophical writings is the compatibility between philosophy and other \"orthodox\" Islamic sciences, particularly theology, and many of his works deal with subjects that theology had an immediate interest in. These include the nature of God, the soul and prophetic knowledge.[19]/nAl-Kindi was born in Kufa to an aristocratic family of the Arab Kinda tribe, descended from the chieftain al-Ash'ath ibn Qays, a contemporary of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad.[20] The family belonged to the most prominent families of the tribal nobility of Kufa in the early Islamic period, until it lost much of its power following the revolt of Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath.[21] His father Ishaq was the governor of Basrah, and al-Kindi received his preliminary education there. He later went to complete his studies in Baghdad, where he was patronized by the Abbasid caliphs al-Ma'mun (r.\u2009813\u2013833) and al-Mu'tasim (r.\u2009833\u2013842). On account of his learning and aptitude for study, al-Ma'mun appointed him to the House of Wisdom, a recently established centre for the translation of Greek philosophical and scientific texts, in Baghdad. He was also well known for his beautiful calligraphy, and at one point was employed as a calligrapher by Caliph al-Mutawakkil (r.\u2009847\u2013861).[22]/nWhen al-Ma'mun died, his brother, al-Mu'tasim became caliph. Al-Kindi's position would be enhanced under al-Mu'tasim, who appointed him as a tutor to his son. But on the accession of al-Wathiq (r.\u2009842\u2013847), and especially of al-Mutawakkil, al-Kindi's star waned.  There are various theories concerning this: some attribute al-Kindi's downfall to scholarly rivalries at the House of Wisdom; others refer to al-Mutawakkil's often violent persecution of unorthodox Muslims (as well as of non-Muslims); at one point al-Kindi was beaten and his library temporarily confiscated. Henry Corbin, an authority on Islamic studies, says that in 873, al-Kindi died \"a lonely man\", in Baghdad during the reign of al-Mu'tamid (r.\u2009870\u2013892).[22]/nAfter his death, al-Kindi's philosophical works quickly fell into obscurity and many of them were lost even to later Islamic scholars and historians. Felix Klein-Franke suggests a number of reasons for this: aside from the militant orthodoxy of al-Mutawakkil, the Mongols also destroyed countless libraries during their invasion. However, he says the most probable cause of this was that his writings never found popularity amongst subsequent influential philosophers such as al-Farabi and Avicenna, who ultimately overshadowed him.[23] His philosophical career peaked under al-Mu'tasim, to whom al-Kindi dedicated his most famous work, On First Philosophy, and whose son Ahmad was tutored by al-Kindi./nAccording to Arab bibliographer Ibn al-Nadim, al-Kindi wrote at least two hundred and sixty books, contributing heavily to geometry (thirty-two books), medicine and philosophy (twenty-two books each), logic (nine books), and physics (twelve books).[24] Although most of his books have been lost over the centuries, a few have survived in the form of Latin translations by Gerard of Cremona, and others have been rediscovered in Arabic manuscripts; most importantly, twenty-four of his lost works were located in the mid-twentieth century in a Turkish library.[25]/nHis greatest contribution to the development of Islamic philosophy was his efforts to make Greek thought both accessible and acceptable to a Muslim audience. Al-Kindi carried out this mission from the House of Wisdom (Bayt al-Hikma), an institute of translation and learning patronized by the Abbasid Caliphs, in Baghdad.[22] As well as translating many important texts, much of what was to become standard Arabic philosophical vocabulary originated with al-Kindi; indeed, if it had not been for him, the work of philosophers like al-Farabi, Avicenna, and al-Ghazali might not have been possible.[26]/nIn his writings, one of al-Kindi's central concerns was to demonstrate the compatibility between philosophy and natural theology on the one hand, and revealed or speculative theology on the other (though in fact he rejected speculative theology). Despite this, he did make clear that he believed revelation was a superior source of knowledge to reason because it guaranteed matters of faith that reason could not uncover. And while his philosophical approach was not always original, and was even considered clumsy by later thinkers (mainly because he was the first philosopher writing in the Arabic language), he successfully incorporated Aristotelian and (especially) neo-Platonist thought into an Islamic philosophical framework. This was an important factor in the introduction and popularization of Greek philosophy in the Muslim intellectual world.[27]/nAl-Kindi took his view of the solar system from Ptolemy, who placed the Earth at the centre of a series of concentric spheres, in which the known heavenly bodies (the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and the stars) are embedded. In one of his treatises on the subject, he says that these bodies are rational entities, whose circular motion is in obedience to and worship of God. Their role, al-Kindi believes, is to act as instruments for divine providence. He furnishes empirical evidence as proof for this assertion; different seasons are marked by particular arrangements of the planets and stars (most notably the sun); the appearance and manner of people varies according to the arrangement of heavenly bodies situated above their homeland.[28]/nHowever, he is ambiguous when it comes to the actual process by which the heavenly bodies affect the material world. One theory he posits in his works is from Aristotle, who conceived that the movement of these bodies causes friction in the sub-lunar region, which stirs up the primary elements of earth, fire, air and water, and these combine to produce everything in the material world. An alternative view found in the treatise On Rays (De radiis) is that the planets exercise their influence in straight lines; but this treatise, written by a Latin author, probably around the middle of the 13th century, is apocryphal.[29] In each of these, two fundamentally different views of physical interaction are presented; action by contact and action at a distance. This dichotomy is duplicated in his writings on optics.[30]/nSome of the notable astrological works by al-Kindi include:[31]/nAl-Kindi was the first major writer on optics since antiquity. Roger Bacon placed him in the first rank after Ptolemy as a writer on the topic.[32] In the apocryphal work known as De radiis stellarum, is developed the theory \"that everything in the world ... emits rays in every direction, which fill the whole world.\"[33] This theory of the active power of rays had an influence on later scholars such as Ibn al-Haytham, Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon.[34]/nTwo major theories of optics appear in the writings of al-Kindi; Aristotelian and Euclidean. Aristotle had believed that in order for the eye to perceive an object, both the eye and the object must be in contact with a transparent medium (such as air) that is filled with light. When these criteria are met, the \"sensible form\" of the object is transmitted through the medium to the eye. On the other hand, Euclid proposed that vision occurred in straight lines when \"rays\" from the eye reached an illuminated object and were reflected back. As with his theories on Astrology, the dichotomy of contact and distance is present in al-Kindi's writings on this subject as well./nThe factor which al-Kindi relied upon to determine which of these theories was most correct was how adequately each one explained the experience of seeing. For example, Aristotle's theory was unable to account for why the angle at which an individual sees an object affects his perception of it. For example, why a circle viewed from the side will appear as a line. According to Aristotle, the complete sensible form of a circle should be transmitted to the eye and it should appear as a circle. On the other hand, Euclidean optics provided a geometric model that was able to account for this, as well as the length of shadows and reflections in mirrors, because Euclid believed that the visual \"rays\" could only travel in straight lines (something which is commonly accepted in modern science). For this reason, al-Kindi considered the latter preponderant.[35]/nAl-Kindi's primary optical treatise \"De aspectibus\" was later translated into Latin. This work, along with Alhazen's Optics and the Arabic translations of Ptolemy and Euclid's Optics, were the main Arabic texts to affect the development of optical investigations in Europe, most notably those of Robert Grosseteste, Vitello and Roger Bacon.[36]/nThere are more than thirty treatises attributed to al-Kindi in the field of medicine, in which he was chiefly influenced by the ideas of Galen.[37] His most important work in this field is probably De Gradibus, in which he demonstrates the application of mathematics to medicine, particularly in the field of pharmacology. For example, he developed a mathematical scale to quantify the strength of a drug, and a system (based on the phases of the moon) that would allow a doctor to determine in advance the most critical days of a patient's illness.[18] According to Plinio Prioreschi, this was the first attempt at serious quantification in medicine.[38]/nAl-Kindi denied the possibility of transmuting base metals into precious metals such as gold and silver, a position that was later attacked by the Persian chemist and physician Abu Bakr al-Razi (c.\u2009865\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009925).[39]/nOne work attributed to al-Kindi, variously known as the Kit\u0101b al-Taraffuq f\u012b l-\u02bfi\u1e6dr (\"The Book of Gentleness on Perfume\") or the Kit\u0101b K\u012bmiy\u0101\u02be al-\u02bfi\u1e6dr wa-l-ta\u1e63\u02bf\u012bd\u0101t (\"The Book of the Chemistry of Perfume and Distillations\"), contains one of the earliest known references to the distillation of wine.[40] The work also describes the distillation process for extracting rose oils, and provides recipes for 107 different kinds of perfumes.[41]/nAl-Kindi authored works on a number of important mathematical subjects, including arithmetic, geometry, the Hindu numbers, the harmony of numbers, lines and multiplication with numbers, relative quantities, measuring proportion and time, and numerical procedures and cancellation.[11] He also wrote four volumes, On the Use of the Hindu Numerals  (Arabic: \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u062f\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0629 Kit\u0101b f\u012b Isti`m\u0101l al-'A`d\u0101d al-Hind\u012byyah) which contributed greatly to diffusion of the Hindu system of numeration in the Middle-East and the West. In geometry, among other works, he wrote on the theory of parallels. Also related to geometry were two works on optics. One of the ways in which he made use of mathematics as a philosopher was to attempt to disprove the eternity of the world by demonstrating that actual infinity is a mathematical and logical absurdity.[42]/nAl-Kindi is credited with developing a method whereby variations in the frequency of the occurrence of letters could be analyzed and exploited to break ciphers (i.e. cryptanalysis by frequency analysis).[17] His book on this topic is Ris\u0101la f\u012b Istikhr\u0101j al-Kutub al-Mu'amm\u0101h  (\u0631\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0633\u062a\u062e\u0631\u0627\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0629; literally: On Extracting Obscured Correspondence, more contemporarily: On Decrypting Encrypted Correspondence). In his treatise on cryptanalysis, he wrote:/nOne way to solve an encrypted message, if we know its language, is to find a different plaintext of the same language long enough to fill one sheet or so, and then we count the occurrences of each letter. We call the most frequently occurring letter the \"first\", the next most occurring letter the \"second\", the following most occurring letter the \"third\", and so on, until we account for all the different letters in the plaintext sample. Then we look at the cipher text we want to solve and we also classify its symbols. We find the most occurring symbol and change it to the form of the \"first\" letter of the plaintext sample, the next most common symbol is changed to the form of the \"second\" letter, and the following most common symbol is changed to the form of the \"third\" letter, and so on, until we account for all symbols of the cryptogram we want to solve.[43]/nAl-Kindi was influenced by the work of al-Khalil (717\u2013786), who wrote the Book of Cryptographic Messages, which contains the first use of permutations and combinations to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels.[14]/nIn a treatise entitled as Risala fi l-Illa al-Failali l-Madd wa l-Fazr (Treatise on the Efficient Cause of the Flow and Ebb), al-Kindi presents a theory on tides which \"depends on the changes which take place in bodies owing to the rise and fall of temperature.\"[44] In order to support his argument, he gave a description of a scientific experiment as follows:/nOne can also observe by the senses... how in consequence of extreme cold air changes into water. To do this, one takes a glass bottle, fills it completely with snow, and closes its end carefully. Then one determines its weight by weighing. One places it in a container... which has previously been weighed. On the surface of the bottle the air changes into water, and appears upon it like the drops on large porous pitchers, so that a considerable amount of water gradually collects inside the container. One then weighs the bottle, the water and the container, and finds their weight greater than previously, which proves the change. [...] Some foolish persons are of opinion that the snow exudes through the glass. This is impossible. There is no process by which water or snow can be made to pass through glass./nIn explaining the natural cause of the wind, and the difference for its directions based on time and location, he wrote:[45]/nWhen the sun is in its northern declination northerly places will heat up and it will be cold towards the south. Then the northern air will expand in a southerly direction because of the heat due to the contraction of the southern air. Therefore most of the summer winds are merits and most of the winter winds are not./nAl-Kindi was the first great theoretician of music in the Arab-Islamic world. He is known to have written fifteen treatises on music theory, but only five have survived. He added a fifth string to the 'ud.[46] His works included discussions on the therapeutic value of music[47] and what he regarded as \"cosmological connections\" of music.[48]/nWhile Muslim intellectuals were already acquainted with Greek philosophy (especially logic), al-Kindi is credited with being the first real Muslim philosopher.[7] His own thought was largely influenced by the Neo-Platonic philosophy of Proclus, Plotinus and John Philoponus, amongst others, although he does appear to have borrowed ideas from other Hellenistic schools as well.[49] He makes many references to Aristotle in his writings, but these are often unwittingly re-interpreted in a Neo-Platonic framework. This trend is most obvious in areas such as metaphysics and the nature of God as a causal entity.[50] Experts have suggested that he was influenced by the Mutazilite school of theology, because of the mutual concern both he and they demonstrated for maintaining the singularity (tawhid) of God. A minority view however holds that such agreements are considered incidental.[8]/nAccording to al-Kindi, the goal of metaphysics is knowledge of God. For this reason, he does not make a clear distinction between philosophy and theology, because he believes they are both concerned with the same subject. Later philosophers, particularly al-Farabi and Avicenna, would strongly disagree with him on this issue, by saying that metaphysics is actually concerned with being qua being, and as such, the nature of God is purely incidental.[19]/nCentral to al-Kindi's understanding of metaphysics is God's absolute oneness, which he considers an attribute uniquely associated with God (and therefore not shared with anything else). By this he means that while we may think of any existent thing as being \"one\", it is in fact both \"one\" and many\". For example, he says that while a body is one, it is also composed of many different parts. A person might say \"I see an elephant\", by which he means \"I see one elephant\", but the term 'elephant' refers to a species of animal that contains many. Therefore, only God is absolutely one, both in being and in concept, lacking any multiplicity whatsoever. Some feel this understanding entails a very rigorous negative theology because it implies that any description which can be predicated to anything else, cannot be said about God.[8][51]/nIn addition to absolute oneness, al-Kindi also described God as the Creator. This means that He acts as both a final and efficient cause. Unlike later Muslim Neo-Platonic philosophers (who asserted that the universe existed as a result of God's existence \"overflowing\", which is a passive act), al-Kindi conceived of God as an active agent. In fact, of God as the agent, because all other intermediary agencies are contingent upon Him.[52] The key idea here is that God \"acts\" through created intermediaries, which in turn \"act\" on one another \u2013 through a chain of cause and effect \u2013 to produce the desired result. In reality, these intermediary agents do not \"act\" at all, they are merely a conduit for God's own action.[50] This is especially significant in the development of Islamic philosophy, as it portrayed the \"first cause\" and \"unmoved mover\" of Aristotelian philosophy as compatible with the concept of God according to Islamic revelation.[53]/nAl-Kindi theorized that there was a separate, incorporeal and universal intellect (known as the \"First Intellect\"). It was the first of God's creation and the intermediary through which all other things came into creation. Aside from its obvious metaphysical importance, it was also crucial to al-Kindi's epistemology, which was influenced by Platonic realism.[54]/nAccording to Plato, everything that exists in the material world corresponds to certain universal forms in the heavenly realm. These forms are really abstract concepts such as a species, quality or relation, which apply to all physical objects and beings. For example, a red apple has the quality of \"redness\" derived from the appropriate universal. However, al-Kindi says that human intellects are only potentially able to comprehend these. This potential is actualized by the First Intellect, which is perpetually thinking about all of the universals. He argues that the external agency of this intellect is necessary by saying that human beings cannot arrive at a universal concept merely through perception. In other words, an intellect cannot understand the species of a thing simply by examining one or more of its instances. According to him, this will only yield an inferior \"sensible form\", and not the universal form which we desire. The universal form can only be attained through contemplation and actualization by the First Intellect.[55]/nThe analogy he provides to explain his theory is that of wood and fire. Wood, he argues, is potentially hot (just as a human is potentially thinking about a universal), and therefore requires something else which is already hot (such as fire) to actualize this. This means that for the human intellect to think about something, the First Intellect must already be thinking about it. Therefore, he says that the First Intellect must always be thinking about everything. Once the human intellect comprehends a universal by this process, it becomes part of the individual's \"acquired intellect\" and can be thought about whenever he or she wishes.[56]/nAl-Kindi says that the soul is a simple, immaterial substance, which is related to the material world only because of its faculties which operate through the physical body. To explain the nature of our worldly existence, he (borrowing from Epictetus) compares it to a ship which has, during the course of its ocean voyage, temporarily anchored itself at an island and allowed its passengers to disembark. The implicit warning is that those passengers who linger too long on the island may be left behind when the ship sets sail again. Here, al-Kindi displays a stoic concept, that we must not become attached to material things (represented by the island), as they will invariably be taken away from us (when the ship sets sail again). He then connects this with a Neo-Platonist idea, by saying that our soul can be directed towards the pursuit of desire or the pursuit of intellect; the former will tie it to the body, so that when the body dies, it will also die, but the latter will free it from the body and allow it to survive \"in the light of the Creator\" in a realm of pure intelligence.[57]/nIn the view of al-Kindi, prophecy and philosophy were two different routes to arrive at the truth. He contrasts the two positions in four ways. Firstly, while a person must undergo a long period of training and study to become a philosopher, prophecy is bestowed upon someone by God. Secondly, the philosopher must arrive at the truth by his own devices (and with great difficulty), whereas the prophet has the truth revealed to him by God. Thirdly, the understanding of the prophet \u2013 being divinely revealed \u2013 is clearer and more comprehensive than that of the philosopher. Fourthly, the way in which the prophet is able to express this understanding to the ordinary people is superior. Therefore, al-Kindi says the prophet is superior in two fields: the ease and certainty with which he receives the truth, and the way in which he presents it. However, the crucial implication is that the content of the prophet's and the philosopher's knowledge is the same. This, says Adamson, demonstrates how limited the superiority al-Kindi afforded to prophecy was.[58][59]/nIn addition to this, al-Kindi adopted a naturalistic view of prophetic visions. He argued that, through the faculty of \"imagination\" as conceived of in Aristotelian philosophy, certain \"pure\" and well-prepared souls, were able to receive information about future events. Significantly, he does not attribute such visions or dreams to revelation from God, but instead explains that imagination enables human beings to receive the \"form\" of something without needing to perceive the physical entity to which it refers. Therefore, it would seem to imply that anyone who has purified themselves would be able to receive such visions. It is precisely this idea, amongst other naturalistic explanations of prophetic miracles that al-Ghazali attacks in his Incoherence of the Philosophers.[60]/nWhile al-Kindi appreciated the usefulness of philosophy in answering questions of a religious nature, there would be many Islamic thinkers who were not as enthusiastic about its potential. But it would be incorrect to assume that they opposed philosophy simply because it was a \"foreign science\". Oliver Leaman, an expert on Islamic philosophy, points out that the objections of notable theologians are rarely directed at philosophy itself, but rather at the conclusions the philosophers arrived at. Even al-Ghazali, who is famous for his critique of the philosophers, was himself an expert in philosophy and logic. And his criticism was that they arrived at theologically erroneous conclusions. The three most serious of these, in his view, were believing in the co-eternity of the universe with God, denying the bodily resurrection, and asserting that God only has knowledge of abstract universals, not of particular things (not all philosophers subscribed to these same views).[61]/nDuring his life, al-Kindi was fortunate enough to enjoy the patronage of the pro-Mutazilite Caliphs al-Ma'mun and al-Mu'tasim, which meant he could carry out his philosophical speculations with relative ease. In his own time, al-Kindi would be criticized for extolling the \"intellect\" as being the most immanent creation in proximity to God, which was commonly held to be the position of the angels.[62] He also engaged in disputations with certain Mutazilites, whom he attacked for their belief in atoms, as not all Mutazilites accepted the belief of atomism.[63] But the real role of al-Kindi in the conflict between philosophers and theologians would be to prepare the ground for debate. His works, says Deborah Black, contained all the seeds of future controversy that would be fully realized in al-Ghazali's Incoherence of the Philosophers.[64]/nAl-Kindi was a master of many different areas of thought and was held to be one of the greatest philosophers. His influence in the fields of physics, mathematics, medicine, philosophy, and music were far-reaching and lasted for several centuries. Ibn al-Nadim in his Kitab al-Fihrist praised al-Kindi and his work stating:/nThe best man of his time, unique in his knowledge of all the ancient sciences. He is called the Philosopher of the Arabs. His books deal with different sciences, such as logic, philosophy, geometry, arithmetic, astronomy etc. We have connected him with the natural philosophers because of his prominence in Science.[65]/nAl-Kindi's major contribution was his establishment of philosophy in the Islamic world and his efforts in trying to harmonize the philosophical investigation along with the Islamic theology and creed. The philosophical texts which were translated under his supervision would become the standard texts in the Islamic world for centuries to come, even after his influence has been eclipsed by later Philosophers.[66]/nAl-Kindi was also an important figure in medieval Europe. Several of his books got translated into Latin influencing western authors like Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon. The Italian Renaissance scholar Geralomo Cardano (1501\u20131575) considered him one of the twelve greatest minds.[67]/nIn 1986, the Royal Commission for Riyadh City inaugurated the Al Kindi Plaza in the Diplomatic Quarter district of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.", "19474114": "Syed Riaz Ahsan (24 December 1951 \u2013 8 September 2008) was a Pakistani statistician and mathematician who has worked in applied statistics, applied analysis, applications of special functions.

In particular, he is recognized for postulating the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, an equation that provides a way to calculate the wave function of a system and how it changes dynamically in time. He coined the term \"quantum entanglement\",[3][4][5] and was the earliest to discuss it, doing so in 1932.[6]/nIn addition, he wrote many works on various aspects of physics: statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, physics of dielectrics, colour theory, electrodynamics, general relativity, and cosmology, and he made several attempts to construct a unified field theory. In his book What Is Life? Schr\u00f6dinger addressed the problems of genetics, looking at the phenomenon of life from the point of view of physics. He also paid great attention to the philosophical aspects of science, ancient, and oriental philosophical concepts, ethics, and religion.[7] He also wrote on philosophy and theoretical biology. In popular culture, he is best known for his \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\" thought experiment.[8][9]/nSpending most of his life as an academic with positions at various universities, Schr\u00f6dinger, along with Paul Dirac, won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933 for his work on quantum mechanics, the same year he left Germany due to his opposition to Nazism. In his personal life, he lived with both his wife and his mistress which may have led to problems causing him to leave his position at Oxford. Subsequently, until 1938, he had a position in Graz, Austria, until the Nazi takeover when he fled, finally finding a long-term arrangement in Dublin, Ireland, where he remained until retirement in 1955, and where he pursued several sexual relationships with minors. He died in Vienna of tuberculosis when he was 73./nSchr\u00f6dinger was born in Erdberg\u00a0[de], Vienna, Austria, on 12 August 1887, to Rudolf Schr\u00f6dinger\u00a0[de] (cerecloth producer, botanist[10]) [11] and Georgine Emilia Brenda Schr\u00f6dinger (n\u00e9e Bauer) (daughter of Alexander Bauer \u00a0[de], professor of chemistry, TU Wien).[12] He was their only child./nHis mother was of half Austrian and half English descent; his father was Catholic and his mother was Lutheran. He himself was an atheist.[13] However, he had strong interests in Eastern religions and pantheism, and he used religious symbolism in his works.[14] He also believed his scientific work was an approach to Divinity, albeit in an intellectual sense.[15]/nHe was also able to learn English outside school, as his maternal grandmother was British.[16] Between 1906 and 1910 (the year he earned his doctorate) Schr\u00f6dinger studied at the University of Vienna under the physicists Franz S. Exner (1849\u20131926) and Friedrich Hasen\u00f6hrl (1874\u20131915). He received his doctorate at Vienna under Hasen\u00f6hrl. He also conducted experimental work with Karl Wilhelm Friedrich \"Fritz\" Kohlrausch. In 1911, Schr\u00f6dinger became an assistant to Exner./nIn 1914 Schr\u00f6dinger achieved habilitation (venia legendi). Between 1914 and 1918 he participated in war work as a commissioned officer in the Austrian fortress artillery (Gorizia, Duino, Sistiana, Prosecco, Vienna). In 1920 he became the assistant to Max Wien, in Jena, and in September 1920 he attained the position of ao. Prof. (ausserordentlicher Professor), roughly equivalent to Reader (UK) or associate professor (US), in Stuttgart. In 1921, he became o. Prof. (ordentlicher Professor, i.e. full professor), in Breslau (now Wroc\u0142aw, Poland).[17]/nIn 1921, he moved to the University of Z\u00fcrich. In 1927, he succeeded Max Planck at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin. In 1933, Schr\u00f6dinger decided to leave Germany because he strongly disapproved of the Nazis' antisemitism. He became a Fellow of Magdalen College at the University of Oxford. Soon after he arrived, he received the Nobel Prize together with Paul Dirac. His position at Oxford did not work out well; his unconventional domestic arrangements, sharing living quarters with two women,[18] were not met with acceptance. In 1934, Schr\u00f6dinger lectured at Princeton University; he was offered a permanent position there, but did not accept it. Again, his wish to set up house with his wife and his mistress may have created a problem.[19] He had the prospect of a position at the University of Edinburgh but visa delays occurred, and in the end he took up a position at the University of Graz in Austria in 1936. He had also accepted the offer of chair position at Department of Physics, Allahabad University in India.[20]/nIn the midst of these tenure issues in 1935, after extensive correspondence with Albert Einstein, he proposed what is now called the Schr\u00f6dinger's cat thought experiment.[21]/nIn 1938, after the Anschluss, Schr\u00f6dinger had problems in Graz because of his flight from Germany in 1933 and his known opposition to Nazism.[22] He issued a statement recanting this opposition (he later regretted doing so and explained the reason to Einstein).[23] However, this did not fully appease the new dispensation and the University of Graz dismissed him from his post for political unreliability. He suffered harassment and was instructed not to leave the country. He and his wife, however, fled to Italy. From there, he went to visiting positions in Oxford and Ghent University.[23][22]/nIn the same year he received a personal invitation from Ireland's Taoiseach, \u00c9amon de Valera \u2013 a mathematician himself \u2013 to reside in Ireland and agreed to help establish an Institute for Advanced Studies in Dublin.[24] He moved to Kincora Road, Clontarf, Dublin, and lived modestly. A plaque has been erected at his Clontarf residence and at the address of his workplace in Merrion Square.[25][26][27] Schr\u00f6dinger believed that as an Austrian he had a unique relationship to Ireland. In October 1940, a writer from the Irish Press interviewed Schr\u00f6dinger who spoke of Celtic heritage of Austrians, saying: \"I believe there is a deeper connection between us Austrians and the Celts. Names of places in the Austrian Alps are said to be of Celtic origin.\"[28] He became the Director of the School for Theoretical Physics in 1940 and remained there for 17 years. He became a naturalized Irish citizen in 1948, but also retained his Austrian citizenship.[29] He wrote around 50 further publications on various topics, including his explorations of unified field theory.[30]/nIn 1944, he wrote What Is Life?, which contains a discussion of negentropy and the concept of a complex molecule with the genetic code for living organisms. According to James D. Watson's memoir, DNA, the Secret of Life, Schr\u00f6dinger's book gave Watson the inspiration to research the gene, which led to the discovery of the DNA double helix structure in 1953. Similarly, Francis Crick, in his autobiographical book What Mad Pursuit, described how he was influenced by Schr\u00f6dinger's speculations about how genetic information might be stored in molecules.[31]/nSchr\u00f6dinger stayed in Dublin until retiring in 1955./nA manuscript \"Fragment from an unpublished dialogue of Galileo\"[32] from this time recently resurfaced at The King's Hospital boarding school, Dublin[33] after it was written for the School's 1955 edition of their Blue Coat to celebrate his leaving of Dublin to take up his appointment as Chair of Physics at the University of Vienna.[34]/nIn 1956, he returned to Vienna (chair ad personam). At an important lecture during the World Energy Conference he refused to speak on nuclear energy because of his scepticism about it and gave a philosophical lecture instead. During this period, Schr\u00f6dinger turned from mainstream quantum mechanics' definition of wave\u2013particle duality and promoted the wave idea alone, causing much controversy.[35][36]/nSchr\u00f6dinger suffered from tuberculosis and several times in the 1920s stayed at a sanatorium in Arosa in Switzerland. It was there that he formulated his wave equation.[8] On 4 January 1961, Schr\u00f6dinger died of tuberculosis, aged 73, in Vienna.[37] He left Anny a widow, and was buried in Alpbach, Austria, in a Catholic cemetery. Although he was not Catholic, the priest in charge of the cemetery permitted the burial after learning Schr\u00f6dinger was a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.[38]/nOn April 6, 1920, Schr\u00f6dinger married Annemarie (Anny) Bertel.[37][39]/nWhen he migrated to Ireland in 1938, he obtained visas for himself, his wife and also another woman, Hilde March. March was the wife of an Austrian colleague and Schr\u00f6dinger had fathered a daughter with her in 1934.[40] Schr\u00f6dinger wrote to the Taoiseach, \u00c9amon de Valera personally, so as to obtain a visa for March. In October 1939 the m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois duly took up residence in Dublin.[40] His wife, Anny (born 3 December 1896), died on 3 October 1965./nOne of Schr\u00f6dinger's grandchildren, Terry Rudolph, has followed in his footsteps as a quantum physicist, and teaches at Imperial College London.[41][42]/nSchr\u00f6dinger kept a record of his sexual liaisons including children he sexually abused in a diary he called Ephemeridae, in which he stated a \"predilection for teenage girls on the grounds that their innocence was the ideal match for his natural genius\".[43]/nAt the age of 39, Schr\u00f6dinger tutored 14-year-old \"Ithi\" Junger. As John Gribbin recounted in his 2012 biography of Schr\u00f6dinger, \"As well as the maths, the lessons included 'a fair amount of petting and cuddling' and Schr\u00f6dinger soon convinced himself that he was in love with Ithi\".[44] Schr\u00f6dinger assured Junger she would not become pregnant, and raped her at 17. She later became pregnant and had an abortion that left her sterile.[43][45] Schr\u00f6dinger left her soon after and moved on to other targets.[46] Kate Nolan, a pseudonym used by surviving family to protect the victim, was also impregnated by Schr\u00f6dinger amid claims of a lack of consent.[43]/nCarlo Rovelli notes in his book Helgoland that Schr\u00f6dinger \"always kept a number of relationships going at once \u2013 and made no secret of his fascination with preadolescent girls\". In Ireland, Rovelli writes, he had one child each from two students[47] identified in a Der Standard article as being a 26-year-old and a married political activist of unknown age.[45] While carrying out research into a family tree, Bernard Biggar uncovered reports of Schr\u00f6dinger grooming his cousin, Barbara MacEntee, when she was 12 years old.[43] Apparently, her uncle, the mathematician and priest P\u00e1draig de Br\u00fan, advised Schr\u00f6dinger to no longer pursue her,[45] and Schr\u00f6dinger later wrote in his journal that she was one of his \"unrequited loves\".[48] MacEntee died in 1995, with the accounts emerging posthumously.[49]/nWalter Moore's biography of the scientist outlined that Schr\u00f6dinger's attitude towards women was \"essentially that of a male supremacist\",[50] an assessment corroborated by Helge Kragh in his review of Moore's biography, \"The conquest of women, especially very young women, was the salt of life for this sincere romantic and male chauvinist\".[51] Walter Moore used Schr\u00f6dinger's relationships with girls to characterise what Moore called Schr\u00f6dinger's \"Lolita Complex\".[43] Schr\u00f6dinger's grandson and his mother were unhappy with the accusation made by Moore, and once the biography was published, their family broke off contact with him.[45]/nIn a 2021 Irish Times article, Schr\u00f6dinger's pattern of serial abuse was identified by the paper as a \"behaviour [that] fitted the profile of a paedophile in the widely understood sense of that term.\"[43] The physics department of Trinity College Dublin announced in January 2022 that they would recommend a lecture theatre that had been named for Schr\u00f6dinger since the 1990s be renamed in light of his history of sexual abuse,[52] while a picture of the scientist would be removed, and the renaming of an eponymous lecture series would be considered.[53] The College's webpage \"The History of the School of Physics\" currently has a photo labeled, \"View of the front desk and blackboard at the Physics Lecture Theatre\".[54]/nEarly in his life, Schr\u00f6dinger experimented in the fields of electrical engineering, atmospheric electricity, and atmospheric radioactivity, but he usually worked with his former teacher Franz Exner. He also studied vibrational theory, the theory of Brownian motion, and mathematical statistics. In 1912, at the request of the editors of the Handbook of Electricity and Magnetism, Schr\u00f6dinger wrote an article titled Dielectrism. That same year, Schr\u00f6dinger gave a theoretical estimate of the probable height distribution of radioactive substances, which is required to explain the observed radioactivity of the atmosphere, and in August 1913 executed several experiments in Zeehame that confirmed his theoretical estimate and those of Victor Franz Hess. For this work, Schr\u00f6dinger was awarded the 1920 Haitinger Prize (Haitinger-Preis) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.[55] Other experimental studies conducted by the young researcher in 1914 were checking formulas for capillary pressure in gas bubbles and the study of the properties of soft beta radiation produced by gamma rays striking a metal surface. The last work he performed together with his friend Fritz Kohlrausch. In 1919, Schr\u00f6dinger performed his last physical experiment on coherent light and subsequently focused on theoretical studies.[citation needed]/nIn the first years of his career, Schr\u00f6dinger became acquainted with the ideas of the old quantum theory, developed in the works of Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Arnold Sommerfeld, and others. This knowledge helped him work on some problems in theoretical physics, but the Austrian scientist at the time was not yet ready to part with the traditional methods of classical physics.[citation needed]/nSchr\u00f6dinger's first publications about atomic theory and the theory of spectra began to emerge only from the beginning of the 1920s, after his personal acquaintance with Sommerfeld and Wolfgang Pauli and his move to Germany. In January 1921, Schr\u00f6dinger finished his first article on this subject, about the framework of the Bohr-Sommerfeld effect of the interaction of electrons on some features of the spectra of the alkali metals. Of particular interest to him was the introduction of relativistic considerations in quantum theory. In autumn 1922, he analyzed the electron orbits in an atom from a geometric point of view, using methods developed by the mathematician Hermann Weyl (1885\u20131955). This work, in which it was shown that quantum orbits are associated with certain geometric properties, was an important step in predicting some of the features of wave mechanics. Earlier in the same year, he created the Schr\u00f6dinger equation of the relativistic Doppler effect for spectral lines, based on the hypothesis of light quanta and considerations of energy and momentum. He liked the idea of his teacher Exner on the statistical nature of the conservation laws, so he enthusiastically embraced the articles of Bohr, Kramers, and Slater, which suggested the possibility of violation of these laws in individual atomic processes (for example, in the process of emission of radiation). Although the experiments of Hans Geiger and Walther Bothe soon cast doubt on this, the idea of energy as a statistical concept was a lifelong attraction for Schr\u00f6dinger, and he discussed it in some reports and publications.[56]/nIn January 1926, Schr\u00f6dinger published in Annalen der Physik the paper \"Quantisierung als Eigenwertproblem\" (Quantization as an Eigenvalue Problem)[57] on wave mechanics and presented what is now known as the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. In this paper, he gave a \"derivation\" of the wave equation for time-independent systems and showed that it gave the correct energy eigenvalues for a hydrogen-like atom. This paper has been universally celebrated as one of the most important achievements of the twentieth century and created a revolution in most areas of quantum mechanics and indeed of all physics and chemistry. A second paper was submitted just four weeks later that solved the quantum harmonic oscillator, rigid rotor, and diatomic molecule problems and gave a new derivation of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. A third paper, published in May, showed the equivalence of his approach to that of Heisenberg and gave the treatment of the Stark effect. A fourth paper in this series showed how to treat problems in which the system changes with time, as in scattering problems. In this paper, he introduced a complex solution to the wave equation in order to prevent the occurrence of fourth- and sixth-order differential equations. Schr\u00f6dinger ultimately reduced the order of the equation to one.[58] (This was arguably the moment when quantum mechanics switched from real to complex numbers.) These papers were his central achievement and were at once recognized as having great significance by the physics community.[citation needed]/nSchr\u00f6dinger was not entirely comfortable with the implications of quantum theory referring to his theory as \"wave mechanics\".[59][60] He wrote about the probability interpretation of quantum mechanics, saying, \"I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it.\" (Just in order to ridicule the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, he contrived the famous thought experiment called Schr\u00f6dinger's cat paradox[61] and was said to have angrily complained to his students that \"now the damned G\u00f6ttingen physicists use my beautiful wave mechanics for calculating their shitty matrix elements.\"[62])/nFollowing his work on quantum mechanics, Schr\u00f6dinger devoted considerable effort to working on a unified field theory that would unite gravity, electromagnetism, and nuclear forces within the basic framework of general relativity, doing the work with an extended correspondence with Albert Einstein.[63] In 1947, he announced a result, \"Affine Field Theory\",[64] in a talk at the Royal Irish Academy, but the announcement was criticized by Einstein as \"preliminary\" and failed to lead to the desired unified theory.[63] Following the failure of his attempt at unification, Schr\u00f6dinger gave up his work on unification and turned to other topics.[citation needed]/nSchr\u00f6dinger had a strong interest in psychology, in particular color perception and colorimetry (German: Farbenmetrik). He spent quite a few years of his life working on these questions and published a series of papers in this area:/nHis work on the psychology of color perception follows the step of Newton, Maxwell and von Helmholtz in the same area. Some of these papers have been translated into English and can be found in: Sources of Colour Science, Ed. David L. MacAdam, MIT Press (1970) and in Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Color Theory, Translated with Modern Commentary, Ed. Keith K. Niall, Springer (2017).

In his 1956 lecture \"Mind and Matter\", he said that \"The world extended in space and time is but our representation.\"[65] This is a repetition of the first words of Schopenhauer's main work. Schopenhauer's works also introduced him to Indian philosophy, more specifically to the Upanishads and Advaita Vedanta\u2019s interpretation. He once took on a particular line of thought: \"If the world is indeed created by our act of observation, there should be billions of such worlds, one for each of us. How come your world and my world are the same? If something happens in my world, does it happen in your world, too? What causes all these worlds to synchronize with each other?\"./n\"There is obviously only one alternative, namely the unification of minds or consciousnesses. Their multiplicity is only apparent, in truth there is only one mind. This is the doctrine of the Upanishads.\"[66]/nSchr\u00f6dinger discussed topics such as consciousness, the mind\u2013body problem, sense perception, free will, and objective reality in his lectures and writings.[66][67][68]/nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s attitude with respect to the relations between Eastern and Western thought was one of prudence, expressing appreciation for Eastern philosophy while also admitting that some of the ideas did not fit with empirical approaches to natural philosophy.[69] Some commentators have suggested that Schr\u00f6dinger was so deeply immersed in a non-dualist Ved\u00e2ntic-like view that it may have served as a broad framework or subliminal inspiration for much of his work including that in theoretical physics.[69] Schr\u00f6dinger expressed sympathy for the idea of tat tvam asi, stating \"you can throw yourself flat on the ground, stretched out upon Mother Earth, with the certain conviction that you are one with her and she with you.\"[70]/nSchr\u00f6dinger said that \"Consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms. For consciousness is absolutely fundamental. It cannot be accounted for in terms of anything else.\"[71]/nThe philosophical issues raised by Schr\u00f6dinger's cat are still debated today and remain his most enduring legacy in popular science, while Schr\u00f6dinger's equation is his most enduring legacy at a more technical level. Schr\u00f6dinger is one of several individuals who have been called \"the father of quantum mechanics\". The large crater Schr\u00f6dinger,[72] on the far side of the Moon, is named after him. The Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger International Institute for Mathematical Physics was founded in Vienna in 1992.[73]/nSchr\u00f6dinger's portrait was the main feature of the design of the 1983\u201397 Austrian 1000-schilling banknote, the second-highest denomination.[74]/nA building is named after him at the University of Limerick, in Limerick, Ireland,[75] as is the 'Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger Zentrum' at Adlershof in Berlin[76] and the Route Schr\u00f6dinger at CERN, Pr\u00e9vessin, France./nSchr\u00f6dinger also has a lecture hall in Trinity College Dublin dedicated to him.

After a long and distinguished career at Moscow State University, he moved to the United States in the 1990s. In 1993 he joined the faculty of Ohio University, from which he retired in 2011./nArhangelskii was the son of Vladimir Alexandrovich Arhangelskii and Maria Pavlova Radimova, who divorced by the time he was four years old. He was raised in Moscow by his father. He was also close to his uncle, childless aircraft designer Alexander Arkhangelsky. In 1954, Arhangelskii entered Moscow State University, where he became a student of Pavel Alexandrov. At the end of his first year, Arhangelskii told Alexandrov that he wanted to specialize in topology.[1]/nIn 1959, in the thesis he wrote for his specialist degree, he introduced the concept of a network of a topological space. Now considered a fundamental topological notion, a network is a collection of subsets that is similar to a basis, without the requirement that the sets be open.[2] Also in 1959 he married Olga Constantinovna.[1]/nHe received his Candidate of Sciences degree (equivalent to a Ph.D.) in 1962 from the Steklov Institute of Mathematics, supervised by Alexandrov.[3] He was granted the Doctor of Sciences degree in 1966./nIt was in 1969 that Arhangelskii published what is considered his most significant mathematical result. Solving a problem posed in 1923 by Alexandrov and Urysohn, he proved that a first-countable, compact Hausdorff space must have a cardinality no greater than the continuum. In fact, his theorem is much more general, giving an upper bound on the cardinality of any Hausdorff space in terms of two cardinal functions. Specifically, he showed that for any Hausdorff space X,/nwhere \u03c7(X) is the character, and L(X) is the Lindel\u00f6f number. Chris Good referred to Arhangelskii's theorem as an \"impressive result\", and \"a model for many other results in the field.\"[4] Richard Hodel has called it \"perhaps the most exciting and dramatic of the difficult inequalities\",[5] a \"beautiful inequality\", and \"the most important inequality in cardinal invariants.\"[6]/nIn 1970 Arhangelskii became a full professor, still at Moscow State University. He spent 1972\u201375 on leave in Pakistan, teaching at the University of Islamabad under a UNESCO program.[1]/nArhangelskii took advantage of the few available opportunities to travel to mathematical conferences outside of the Soviet Union.[1] He was at a conference in Prague when the 1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt took place. Returning under very uncertain conditions, he began to seek academic opportunities in the United States.[7] In 1993 he accepted a professorship at Ohio University, where he received the Distinguished Professor Award in 2003.[8]/nArhangelskii was one of the founders of the journal Topology and its Applications, and volume 153 issue 13, July 2006, was a special issue, with most of the papers based on talks given at a special conference held at Brooklyn College 30 June\u20133 July 2003 in honor of his 65th birthday.", "65677026": "Daniel Afedzi Akyeampong FGA (24 November 1938 \u2013 7 March 2015) was a Ghanaian academic.

That was how in October 1964, Jimmy Boyce, Ray Rivers and myself became the first postgraduate students of Salam in Trieste, and so had the honour of joining the post doctoral colleagues Bob Delbourgo and John Strathdee to become members of the group that was christened by Ms. Jean Bouckley and Ms Miriam Lewis as \"the Salam Boys\".\"[2]/nIn 1965, Akyeampong became one of the first Fellows of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste.[2][3] About the vibrant scholarly culture at the Trieste institution, Akyeampong recounted:/n\"Salam worked hard to get the Centre known world-wide and we were naturally infected by his ceaseless dedication. We had our lunches together at the Mensa dei Ferrovieri with him at the table head, John and Ray at one side of the table and Bob and Jimmy on the other, with me deciding when to sit next to Ray or to Jimmy. These became physics working lunches - with paper napkins serving as writing equipment - and each session usually ended with several suggestions from Salam or Bob or John for us graduate students to pursue later. The excitement and enthusiasm Salam displayed were infectious; and later when I had the privilege to collaborate with Delbourgo, who was my unofficial supervisor, it became clear that he was indeed a chip off the old block.\"[2]/nIn September 1966, Akyeampong returned to London and a month later, the University of London awarded him a doctorate in Mathematical Physics.

The Suda (10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia) mentions him writing a commentary on Archimedes' Method (late 3rd century BC),[1] and Strabo's Geographica mentioned mathematicians Hipparchus (c.\u2009190 \u2013 c.\u2009120 BC) and \"Theodosius and his sons\" as among the residents of Bithynia distinguished for their learning.[2] Later Vitruvius (1st century BC) mentioned a sundial invented by Theodosius. Thus Theodosius lived sometime after Archimedes and before Vitruvius, likely contemporaneously with or after Hipparchus, probably sometime between 200\u201350 BC.[3]/nHistorically he was called Theodosius of Tripolis due to a confusing paragraph in the Suda which probably fused the entries about separate people named Theodosius,[4][1] and was interpreted to mean that he came either from the Tripolis in Phoenicia or the one in Africa.[5] Some sources claim he moved from Bithynia to Tripolis,[6] or came from a hypothetical city called Tripolis in Bithynia.[7]/nTheodosius' chief work, the Spherics (Greek: \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac t\u00e1 sphairik\u00e1), provided the mathematics for spherical astronomy. Euclid's Phenomena and Autolycus's On the Moving Sphere, both dating from two centuries prior, make use of theorems proven in Spherics, so it has been speculated that they may have expected readers to be familiar with a treatise on elementary spherical geometry, perhaps by Eudoxus of Cnidus (4th century BC), on which the Spherics may have been based.[8] However, no mention of this hypothetical earlier work or its author remains today./nIn addition to the Spherics, two other works by Theodosius have survived: On Habitations, describing the appearances of the heavens at different climes and different times of the year, and On Days and Nights, a study of the apparent motion of the Sun. All three were transmitted together, as part of a collection of treatises now called the Little Astronomy, an assortment of shorter works on geometry and astronomy building on Euclid's Elements. During the Islamic Golden Age, the books in the collection were translated into Arabic, and with the addition of a few new works, were known as the Middle Books, intended to fit between the Elements and Ptolemy's Almagest.[9] Theodosius' works were published in Latin in the 16th century.[10]/nTheodosius was cited by Vitruvius as having invented a sundial suitable for any place on Earth.[11]/nThis text was historically taken to refer to a single person, but the sentences about the Theodosius from Tripoli who wrote verses about the spring were likely intended to represent a separate entry. Furthermore, Theudas lived after Theodosius of Bithynia; the commentary on Theudas and Skeptical Chapters were written by someone else, perhaps a different Theodosius. The other listed works were by the Theodosius who wrote the Spherics, including presumably the (now-lost) commentary on Archimedes' Method.", "501523": "Benjamin Gompertz FRS (5 March 1779 \u2013 14 July 1865) was a British self-educated mathematician and actuary, who became a Fellow of the Royal Society. Gompertz is now best known for his Gompertz law of mortality, a demographic model published in 1825. He was the brother of the early animal rights activist and inventor Lewis Gompertz and the poet Isaac Gompertz.[1]/nOf the German Jewish family of Gompertz of Emmerich, he was born in London, where his father and grandfather had been successful diamond merchants. Debarred, as a Jew, from a university education, he studied on his own from an early age, in the writings of Isaac Newton, Colin Maclaurin, and William Emerson. From 1798 he was a prominent contributor to the Gentleman's Mathematical Companion, and for a period won the annual prizes in the magazine for the solutions of problems.[2] Gompertz married Abigail Montefiore (1790\u20131871) in 1810; they had three children.[2]/nIn line with his father's wishes, he entered the London Stock Exchange. He became a member of the Mathematical Society of Spitalfields, and served as its president when it was merged with the Astronomical Society of London. In 1819 he was elected a F.R.S., and in 1832 became a member of the council. The Astronomical Society was founded in 1820, and he was elected a member of the council in 1821.[2]/nOn the death of his only son he retired from the Stock Exchange, and absorbed himself in mathematics. When the Guardian Insurance Office was established in 1821, he was a candidate for the actuaryship, but the directors objected to him on the grounds that he was a Jew. His brother-in-law Sir Moses Montefiore with his relative Nathan Mayer Rothschild then founded the Alliance Assurance Company (1824), and Gompertz was appointed actuary under the deed of settlement. His management of the Alliance Company was successful, he was consulted by government, and made computations for the Army medical board.[2]/nIn 1848 he retired from active work and returned to his scientific labours. He was a member of many learned societies, and was also one of the promoters of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. Of the leading Jewish charities he was a prominent member, and he worked out a plan of poor relief,[3] which was afterwards adopted by the Jewish board of guardians.[2]/nGompertz died from a paralytic seizure on 14 July 1865.[2]/nFrom 1806 he was a frequent contributor to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society; but his early tracts on complex numbers and porisms (1817\u201318) were self-published. Gompertz was an old-fashioned Newtonian who retained and defended the notation of fluxions.[2]/nFor ten years he actively participated in the work of the Astronomical Society, contributing papers on the theory of astronomical instruments, the aberration of light, the differential sextant, and the convertible pendulum. With Francis Baily he began in 1822 the construction of tables for the mean places of the fixed stars; the work was left uncompleted, because of the publication of the Fundamenta Astronomi\u00e6 of Friedrich Bessel. Their efforts, however, led to the complete catalogue of stars of the Royal Astronomical Society.[2]/nHe worked out a new series of tables of mortality for the Royal Society, and these suggested to him in 1825 his law of human mortality, which he first expounded in a letter to Francis Baily. The law rests on an a priori assumption that a person's resistance to death decreases as his years increase. The model can be written in this way:[4]/nN\n(\nt\n)\n=\nN\n(\n0\n)\n\ne\n\n\u2212\nc\n(\n\ne\n\na\nt\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\n\n,\n\u00a0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N(t)=N(0)e^{-c(e^{at}-1)},\\ }\n\n\nwhere N(t) represents the number of individuals at time t, and c and a are constants./nThis model is a refinement of a demographic model of Robert Malthus. It was used by insurance companies to calculate the cost of life insurance.  The equation, known as a Gompertz curve, is now used in many areas to model a time series where growth is slowest at the start and end of a period.  The model has been extended to the Gompertz\u2013Makeham law of mortality./nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0\"Gompertz, Benjamin\".

In 2010 Barwick became an assistant professor at MIT, and in 2013 he became the Cecil and Ida Green Career Development Assistant Professor of Mathematics. In 2015 Barwick was a Fulbright visiting professor at the University of Glasgow and was promoted to Cecil and Ida Green Career Development Associate Professor of Mathematics at MIT, a position which he held until he became a reader at the University of Edinburgh in 2017.[3][4] In 2020, Barwick was promoted to a professor at the University of Edinburgh.[5]/nA theme in Barwick's work is the homotopy theory of higher categories. In his early career, he frequently collaborated with Dan Kan; much of their work was concerned with models for the homotopy theory of homotopy theories. In his joint work with Chris Schommer-Pries, Barwick and Schommer-Pries proved a unicity theorem for the homotopy theory of (\u221e,n)-categories./nBarwick has also made contributions to algebraic K-theory. In particular, Barwick defined higher-categorical generalizations of Waldhausen categories and Waldhausen's S-construction and used these to extend Waldhausen's K-theory to the setting of (\u221e,1)-categories. Using this new theory, he proved the Theorem of the Heart for Waldhausen K-theory. In joint work with John Rognes, he generalized Quillen's Q-construction to the higher-categorical setting, providing higher-categorical generalizations of Quillen's Theorem B as well as Quillen's d\u00e9vissage argument in the process. Much of his recent work has concerned equivariant algebraic K-theory and equivariant homotopy theory. Barwick won the 2019 Berwick Prize of the London Mathematical Society for his paper \"On the algebraic K-theory of higher categories\" where he \"proves that Waldhausen's algebraic K-theory is the universal homology theory for \u221e-categories, and uses this universality to reprove the major fundamental theorems of the subject in this new context.\"[6][7]", "63186713": "Laura Christine Kinsey is an American mathematician specializing in topology.

He is known for attempting to solve doubling the cube.  He was one of the most influential Greek mathematicians of the 18th century.  His teacher was the notable scientist Methodios Anthrakites.  He made a significant contribution to the Modern Greek Enlightenment during the Ottoman occupation of the Greek world.[1]/nBalanos was born in Ioannina, a major center of the Greek Enlightenment movement during that time.[2] He was a student of Methodios Anthrakites director of the local Gouma (later Balaneios) school. As a teacher, he initially became director of the school Epifaneios Igoumenos (1719\u20131734) and then the Gouma. Both schools were the most prestigious in Ioannina./nRegarding the Greek language question, he supported the conservative party and teaching classical Greek in education.  Eugenios Voulgaris accused Balanos of not supporting the progressive Demotic.[3] In ca. 1760 his son Kosmas Balanos succeeded him as schoolmaster of the Gouma School.[4]/nBecause he experienced the Methodios Affair first hand he was a strict teacher of Korydalism.

However, the best grade in the Mathematical Tripos of that year was for Philippa Fawcett, but she was not included in the list for her gender.[1]/nUpon completion of his studies he was appointed college lecturer of mathematics at Emmanuel College, Cambridge.

Adriaan van Wijngaarden offered him a job as the first computer programmer in the Netherlands at the Mathematical Center in Amsterdam, where he worked from 1952 until 1962. He formulated and solved the shortest path problem in 1956, and in 1960 developed the first compiler for the programming language ALGOL 60 in conjunction with colleague Jaap A. Zonneveld. In 1962 he moved to Eindhoven, and later to Nuenen, where he became a professor in the Mathematics Department at the Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven. In the late 1960s he built the THE multiprogramming system, which influenced the designs of subsequent systems through its use of software-based paged virtual memory. Dijkstra joined Burroughs Corporation as its sole research fellow in August 1973. The Burroughs years saw him at his most prolific in output of research articles. He wrote nearly 500 documents in the \"EWD\" series, most of them technical reports, for private circulation within a select group./nDijkstra accepted the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in the Computer Science Department at the University of Texas at Austin in 1984, working in Austin, Texas until his retirement in November 1999. He and his wife returned from Austin to his original house in Nuenen, where he died on 6 August 2002 after a long struggle with cancer.[3]/nHe received the 1972 Turing Award for fundamental contributions to developing structured programming languages. Shortly before his death, he received the ACM PODC Influential Paper Award in distributed computing for his work on self-stabilization of program computation. This annual award was renamed the Dijkstra Prize the following year, in his honor./nEdsger W. Dijkstra was born in Rotterdam.  His father was a chemist who was president of the Dutch Chemical Society; he taught chemistry at a secondary school and was later its superintendent. His mother was a mathematician, but never had a formal job.[4][5]/nDijkstra had considered a career in law and had hoped to represent the Netherlands in the United Nations. However, after graduating from school in 1948, at his parents' suggestion he studied mathematics and physics and then theoretical physics at the University of Leiden.[6]/nIn the early 1950s, electronic computers were a novelty. Dijkstra stumbled on his career by accident, and through his supervisor, Professor Johannes Haantjes\u00a0[nl], he met Adriaan van Wijngaarden, the director of the Computation Department at the Mathematical Center in Amsterdam, who offered Dijkstra a job; he officially became the Netherlands' first \"programmer\" in March 1952.[6]/nFor some time Dijkstra remained committed to physics, working on it in Leiden three days out of each week. With increasing exposure to computing, however, his focus began to shift. As he recalled:[7]/nAfter having programmed for some three years, I had a discussion with A. van Wijngaarden, who was then my boss at the Mathematical Center in Amsterdam, a discussion for which I shall remain grateful to him as long as I live. The point was that I was supposed to study theoretical physics at the University of Leiden simultaneously, and as I found the two activities harder and harder to combine, I had to make up my mind, either to stop programming and become a real, respectable theoretical physicist, or to carry my study of physics to a formal completion only, with a minimum of effort, and to become....., yes what? A programmer? But was that a respectable profession? For after all, what was programming? Where was the sound body of knowledge that could support it as an intellectually respectable discipline? I remember quite vividly how I envied my hardware colleagues, who, when asked about their professional competence, could at least point out that they knew everything about vacuum tubes, amplifiers and the rest, whereas I felt that, when faced with that question, I would stand empty-handed. Full of misgivings I knocked on Van Wijngaarden's office door, asking him whether I could \"speak to him for a moment\"; when I left his office a number of hours later, I was another person. For after having listened to my problems patiently, he agreed that up till that moment there was not much of a programming discipline, but then he went on to explain quietly that automatic computers were here to stay, that we were just at the beginning and could not I be one of the persons called to make programming a respectable discipline in the years to come? This was a turning point in my life and I completed my study of physics formally as quickly as I could./nWhen Dijkstra married Maria (Ria) C. Debets in 1957, he was required as a part of the marriage rites to state his profession. He stated that he was a programmer, which was unacceptable to the authorities, there being no such profession then in The Netherlands.[7][8]/nIn 1959, he received his PhD from the University of Amsterdam for a thesis entitled 'Communication with an Automatic Computer',[9] devoted to a description of the assembly language designed for the first commercial computer developed in the Netherlands, the Electrologica X1. His thesis supervisor was Van Wijngaarden.[10]/nFrom 1952 until 1962, Dijkstra worked at the Mathematisch Centrum in Amsterdam,[10] where he worked closely with Bram Jan Loopstra and Carel S. Scholten, who had been hired to build a computer. Their mode of interaction was disciplined: They would first decide upon the interface between the hardware and the software, by writing a programming manual. Then the hardware designers would have to be faithful to their part of the contract, while Dijkstra, the programmer, would write software for the nonexistent machine. Two of the lessons he learned from this experience were the importance of clear documentation, and that program debugging can be largely avoided through careful design.[6]\nDijkstra formulated and solved the shortest path problem for a demonstration at the official inauguration of the ARMAC computer in 1956. Because of the absence of journals dedicated to automatic computing, he did not publish the result until 1959./nAt the Mathematical Center, Dijkstra and his colleague Jaap Zonneveld\u00a0[nl] developed the first compiler for the programming language ALGOL 60 by August 1960, more than a year before a compiler was produced by another group.[6] ALGOL 60 is known as a key advance in the rise of structured programming./nIn 1962, Dijkstra moved to Eindhoven, and later to Nuenen, in the south of the Netherlands, where he became a professor in the Mathematics Department at the Eindhoven University of Technology.[10] The university did not have a separate computer science department and the culture of the mathematics department did not particularly suit him. Dijkstra tried to build a group of computer scientists who could collaborate on solving problems. This was an unusual model of research for the Mathematics Department.[6] In the late 1960s, he built the THE operating system (named for the university, then known as Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven), which has influenced the designs of subsequent operating systems through its use of software-based paged virtual memory.[11]/nDijkstra joined Burroughs Corporation, a company known then for producing computers based on an innovative hardware architecture, as its research fellow in August 1973. His duties consisted of visiting some of the firm's research centers a few times a year and carrying on his own research, which he did in the smallest Burroughs research facility, namely, his study on the second floor of his house in Nuenen. In fact, Dijkstra was the only research fellow of Burroughs and worked for it from home, occasionally travelling to its branches in the United States. As a result, he reduced his appointment at the university to one day a week. That day, Tuesday, soon became known as the day of the famous 'Tuesday Afternoon Club', a seminar during which he discussed with his colleagues scientific articles, looking at all aspects: notation, organisation, presentation, language, content, etc. Shortly after he moved in 1984 to the University of Texas at Austin (USA), a new 'branch' of the Tuesday Afternoon Club emerged in Austin, Texas.[10]/nThe Burroughs years saw him at his most prolific in output of research articles. He wrote nearly 500 documents in the EWD series (described below), most of them technical reports, for private circulation within a select group.[6]/nDijkstra accepted the Schlumberger Centennial Chair in the Computer Science Department at the University of Texas at Austin in 1984./nDijkstra worked in Austin until his retirement  in November 1999. To mark the occasion and to celebrate his forty-plus years of seminal contributions to computing science, the Department of Computer Sciences organized a symposium, which took place on his 70th birthday in May 2000.[6]/nDijkstra and his wife returned from Austin to his original house in Nuenen (Netherlands) where he found that he had only months to live. He said that he wanted to retire in Austin, Texas, but to die in the Netherlands. Dijkstra died on 6 August 2002 after a long struggle with cancer.[3][12][13][14] He and his wife were survived by their three children: Marcus, Femke, and the computer scientist Rutger M. Dijkstra.[citation needed]/nYou can hardly blame M.I.T. for not taking notice of an obscure computer scientist in a small town in the Netherlands./nIn the world of computing science, Dijkstra is well known as a \"character\". In the preface of his book A Discipline of Programming (1976) he stated the following: \"For the absence of a bibliography I offer neither explanation nor apology.\" In fact, most of his articles and books have no references at all.[10] This approach to references was deplored by some researchers.[who?] Dijkstra chose this way of working to preserve his self-reliance.[citation needed]/nAs a university professor for much of his life, Dijkstra saw teaching not just as a required activity but as a serious research endeavour.[6] His approach to teaching was unconventional.[17] His lecturing style has been described as idiosyncratic. When lecturing, the long pauses between sentences have often been attributed to the fact that English is not Dijkstra's first language. However the pauses also served as a way for him to think on his feet and he was regarded as a quick and deep thinker while engaged in the act of lecturing. His courses for students in Austin had little to do with computer science but they dealt with the presentation of mathematical proofs.[10] At the beginning of each semester, he would take a photo of each of his students in order to memorize their names. He never followed a textbook, with the possible exception of his own while it was under preparation. When lecturing, he would write proofs in chalk on a blackboard rather than using overhead foils. He invited the students to suggest ideas, which he then explored, or refused to explore because they violated some of his tenets. He assigned challenging homework problems, and would study his students' solutions thoroughly. He conducted his final examinations orally, over a whole week. Each student was examined in Dijkstra's office or home, and an exam lasted several hours.[6]/nDijkstra was also highly original in his way of assessing people's capacity for a job. When Vladimir Lifschitz came to Austin in 1990 for a job interview, Dijkstra gave him a puzzle. Lifschitz solved it and has been working in Austin since then.[10]/nHe eschewed the use of computers in his own work for many decades. Even after he succumbed to his UT colleagues' encouragement and acquired a Macintosh computer, he used it only for e-mail and for browsing the World Wide Web.[18] Dijkstra never wrote his articles using a computer. He preferred to rely on his typewriter and later on his Montblanc pen.[10] Dijkstra's favorite writing instrument was the Montblanc Meisterst\u00fcck fountain pen./nHe had no use for word processors, believing that one should be able to write a letter or article without rough drafts, rewriting, or any significant editing. He would work it all out in his head before putting pen to paper, and once mentioned that when he was a physics student he would solve his homework problems in his head while walking the streets of Leiden.[6]\nMost of Dijkstra's publications were written by him alone. He never had a secretary and took care of all his correspondence alone.[10] When colleagues prepared a Festschrift for his sixtieth birthday, published by Springer-Verlag, he took the trouble to thank each of the 61 contributors separately, in a hand-written letter.[10]/nIn The Humble Programmer (1972), Dijkstra wrote: \"We must not forget that it is not our [computing scientists'] business to make programs, it is our business to design classes of computations that will display a desired behaviour.\"/nDijkstra also opposed the inclusion of software engineering under the umbrella of academic computer science. He wrote that, \"As economics is known as \"The Miserable Science\", software engineering should be known as \"The Doomed Discipline\", doomed because it cannot even approach its goal since its goal is self-contradictory.\" And \"software engineering has accepted as its charter 'How to program if you cannot.'\"[19]/nDijkstra led a modest lifestyle, to the point of being spartan.[10] His and his wife's house in Nuenen was simple, small and unassuming. He did not own a television, a video player, or a mobile telephone, and did not go to the movies.[10] He played the piano, and, while in Austin, liked to go to concerts. An enthusiastic listener of classical music, Dijkstra's favorite composer was Mozart.[6]/nThroughout Dijkstra's career, his work was characterized by elegance and economy.[10] A prolific writer (especially as an essayist), Dijkstra authored more than 1,300 papers, many written by hand in his precise script. They were essays and parables; fairy tales and warnings; comprehensive explanation and pedagogical pretext. Most were about mathematics and computer science; others were trip reports that are more revealing about their author than about the people and places visited. It was his habit to copy each paper and circulate it to a small group of colleagues who would copy and forward the papers to another limited group of scientists.[20]/nDijkstra was well known for his habit of carefully composing manuscripts with his fountain pen. The manuscripts are called EWDs, since Dijkstra numbered them with EWD, his initials, as a prefix. According to Dijkstra himself, the EWDs started when he moved from the Mathematical Centre in Amsterdam to the Eindhoven University of Technology (then Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven). After going to Eindhoven, Dijkstra experienced a writer's block for more than a year. He distributed photocopies of a new EWD among his colleagues. Many recipients photocopied and forwarded their copies, so the EWDs spread throughout the international computer science community. The topics were computer science and mathematics, and included trip reports, letters, and speeches. These short articles span a period of 40 years. Almost all EWDs appearing after 1972 were hand-written. They are rarely longer than 15 pages and are consecutively numbered. The last one, No. 1318, is from 14 April 2002. Within computer science they are known as the EWD reports, or, simply the EWDs. More than 1300 EWDs have been scanned, with a growing number transcribed to facilitate search, and are available online at the Dijkstra archive of the University of Texas.[21]/nHis interest with simplicity came at an early age and under his mother's guidance. He once said he had asked his mother whether trigonometry was a difficult topic. She replied that he must learn all the formulas and that further, if he required more than five lines to prove something, he was on the wrong track.[22]/nDijkstra was famous for his wit, eloquence, rudeness, abruptness and often cruelty to fellow professionals, and way with words, such as in his remark, \"The question of whether Machines Can Think (\u2026) is about as relevant as the question of whether Submarines Can Swim.\"[23] His advice to a promising researcher, who asked how to select a topic for research, was the phrase: \"Do only what only you can do\".[6] Dijkstra was also known for his vocal criticism and absence of social skills when interacting with colleagues. As an outspoken and critical visionary, he strongly opposed the teaching of BASIC.[24]/nIn many of his more witty essays, Dijkstra described a fictional company of which he served as chairman. The company was called Mathematics, Inc., a company that he imagined having commercialized the production of mathematical theorems in the same way that software companies had commercialized the production of computer programs.  He invented a number of activities and challenges of Mathematics Inc. and documented them in several papers in the EWD series. The imaginary company had produced a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis but then had great difficulties collecting royalties from mathematicians who had proved results assuming the Riemann Hypothesis. The proof itself was a trade secret.[25] Many of the company's proofs were rushed out the door and then much of the company's effort had to be spent on maintenance.[26] A more successful effort was the Standard Proof for Pythagoras' Theorem, that replaced the more than 100 incompatible existing proofs.[27] Dijkstra described Mathematics Inc. as \"the most exciting and most miserable business ever conceived\".[25] EWD 443 (1974) describes his fictional company as having over 75 percent of the world's market share.[28][29]/nDijkstra won the Turing award in 1972 for his advocacy of structured programming, a programming paradigm that makes use of structured control flow as opposed to unstructured jumps to different sections in a program using Goto statements. His 1968 letter to the editor of Communications of ACM, \"Go To statement considered harmful\", caused a major debate. Modern programmers generally adhere to the paradigm of structured programming.[30]/nAmong his most famous contributions to computer science is shortest path algorithm, known as Dijkstra's algorithm, widely taught in modern computer science undergraduate courses. His other contributions included the Shunting yard algorithm; the THE multiprogramming system, an important early example of structuring a system as a set of layers; the Banker's algorithm; and the semaphore construct for coordinating multiple processors and programs. Another concept formulated by Dijkstra in the field of distributed computing is that of self-stabilization \u2013 an alternative way to ensure the reliability of the system. Dijkstra's algorithm is used in SPF, Shortest Path First, which is used in the routing protocols OSPF and IS-IS.[31][32]/nAmong Dijkstra's awards and honors are:[18]/nIn 1969, the British Computer Society (BCS) received approval for an award and fellowship, Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society (DFBCS), to be awarded under bylaw 7 of their royal charter.

Speakers came from all over the United States and Europe, and a group of computer scientists contributed research articles which were edited into a book.[38]/nIn 2002, the C&C Foundation of Japan recognized Dijkstra \"for his pioneering contributions to the establishment of the scientific basis for computer software through creative research in basic software theory, algorithm theory, structured programming, and semaphores.\" Dijkstra was alive to receive notice of the award, but it was accepted by his family in an award ceremony after his death./nShortly before his death in 2002, Dijkstra received the ACM PODC Influential-Paper Award in distributed computing for his work on self-stabilization of program computation. This annual award was renamed the Dijkstra Prize (Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing) the following year, in his honor./nThe Dijkstra Award for Outstanding Academic Achievement in Computer Science (Loyola University Chicago, Department of Computer Science) is named for Edsger W.

He became an ordinary professor at Greifswald in 1928.[1][2]/nHe remained in Greifswald for the rest of his career, \"with an outstanding research record and a reputation as a fine, thoughtful teacher\".

In a 1928 paper, Zur Zerlegung der euklidischen R\u00e4ume in kongeuente Polytope[7] Reinhardt solved this part by finding an example of such a tessellation.

In 1935, Pogorelov won the first prize at the Mathematical Olympiad in Kharkiv State University. After high school graduation in 1937, he entered the mathematical department of the Kharkiv State University. He was the best student at the department./nIn 1941, after the involvement of the Soviet Union in the World War II, Pogorelov was sent for 11 months study to N.Y.

By recommendation of I.G. Petrovsky (Dean of the Mechanics and Mathematics Department) and a well-known geometer V.F. Kagan, Pogorelov met A.D. Aleksandrov \u2013 the founder of the theory of non-smooth convex surfaces. There were many new questions concerning this theory. Aleksandrov proposed to give an answer to one of them to Pogorelov. In a year the problem was solved and Pogorelov was enrolled to the graduate school of the Mechanics and Mathematics Department of Moscow State University. Nikolai Yefimov became his scientific advisor on topics of Aleksandrov theory. After defending his Ph.D. thesis in 1947, he was demobilized and moved to Kharkiv, where he started to work at the Institute of Mathematics of Kharkov State University and the Geometry Department of the university.

In 1961 he became an Academician of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. In 1976, he became an Academician of the USSR Academy of Sciences (Mathematics Division). From 1950 to 1960 he was the Head of the Geometry Department at Kharkiv State University. From 1960 to 2000 he was the Head of the Geometry Division at the Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine./nSince 2000 he lived in Moscow and worked at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics./nHe died on December 17, 2002, and was buried in Moscow at the Nikolo-Arkhangelsk cemetery./nBy the beginning of the 20th century, the methods for solving of local problems related to regular surfaces were developed. By the thirties, there were developed the methods for solving the problems in geometry \"in the large\". These methods were related mainly to the theory of partial differential equations. Mathematicians were helpless when surfaces were non-smooth (for example, with conical points, ribbed points, etc.) and when the intrinsic geometry was given not by a smooth positive definite quadratic form, but simply by a metric space of a fairly general form. A breakthrough in the study of non-smooth metrics and non-smooth surfaces was made by an outstanding geometer A.D. Aleksandrov. He developed the theory of metric spaces of non-negative curvature, so-called Aleksandrov metric spaces. As a special case, the theory covered the intrinsic geometry of general convex surfaces, that is boundaries of convex bodies. Aleksandrov studied connections between the intrinsic and extrinsic geometries of general convex surfaces. He proved that every metric of non-negative curvature given on a two-dimensional sphere (including non-smooth metrics, so-called inner metrics) can be isometrically immersed into the three-dimensional Euclidean space in a form of a closed convex surface, but the answers to the following fundamental questions were unknown:/nAfter solving these problems, the theory created by Aleksandrov would have received \u201cfull citizenship\u201d in mathematics and could be applied also in the classical regular case. Each of these 3 questions was answered positively by Pogorelov. Using synthetic geometric methods, he developed geometric methods to obtain priori estimates for solutions of Monge-Amp\u00e8re equations. On the one hand, he used these equations to solve geometric problems; on the other hand, based on geometric reasons, he constructed a generalized solution of a Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation and then proved its regularity for a regular right-hand side of the equation. In fact, in these pioneering works Pogorelov laid the foundation of the field of geometric analysis. He proved the following fundamental results:/nFor domains on convex surfaces assertions 1) and 2) are false. The local and global properties of surfaces are significantly different. By proving assertion 1) Pogorelov completed the solution of the problem open for more than a century. The first result in this direction was obtained by Cauchy for closed convex polyhedra in 1813./nThe theorems proved by Pogorelov formed the basis for his nonlinear theory of thin shells. This theory is concerned with those elastic states of the shell which differ significantly comparing to the original form. Under such deformations, the middle surface of a thin shell undergoes bending with preservation of the metric. This makes it possible, by using theorems proved by Pogorelov for convex surfaces, to investigate loss of stability and the over critical elastic state of convex shells under a given strain. Such shells are the most common elements of modern designs./nResults 1) and 2) were generalized for regular surfaces in a Riemannian space. In addition, the Weyl problem for Riemannian space was solved: it was proved that a regular metric of Gaussian curvature greater than some constant c on a two-dimensional sphere can be isometrically immersed into a complete three-dimensional Riemannian space of curvature <c in a form of a regular surface. Studying the methods developed in the proof of this result, the Abel Prize laureate M. Gromov introduced the concept of pseudoholomorphic curves, which are the main tool in modern symplectic geometry./nA closed convex hypersurface is uniquely defined not only by the metric but also by the Gaussian curvature as a function of unit normals. Moreover, the hypersurface is uniquely determined up to a parallel transport. This was proved by G. Minkowski. But is the hypersurface regular under the condition that the Gaussian curvature K(n) is a regular function of a unit normal? Pogorelov proved that if positive function K(n) belongs to the class \u0421k, k\u22653, then the support function will be of regularity class \u0421k+1,v, 0<v<1./nThe hardest part of the proof of the theorem was to obtain a priori estimates for the derivatives of the support function of a hypersurface up to third order inclusively. Pogorelov's method of a priori estimates was used by S.-T. Yau to obtain a priori estimates for solutions of complex Monge-Ampere equations. This was the main step in the proof of the existence of Calabi-Yao manifolds, which play an important role in theoretical physics. A Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation has the form/nA priori estimates in the Minkowski problem are a priori for the solution of the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation with the function/nAt that time there was no approach to studying this completely nonlinear equation. A. V. Pogorelov has created the theory of the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation by using the geometric methods. First, going from polyhedra, he proved the existence of generalized solutions under natural conditions on the right-hand side. After that he has found the a priori estimates for the derivatives up to the third order inclusively for the regular solutions. Using the a priori estimates, he has proved the regularity of strictly convex solutions, the existence of solutions of the Dirichlet problem and their regularity. The Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation is an essential component of the Monge-Kantorovich transport problem; it is used in conformal, affine, K\u00e4hler geometries, in meteorology and in financial mathematics. Pogorelov once said about the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation: this is a great equation with which I had the honor to work./nOne of the most conceptual works of Pogorelov refers to the cycle of works about smooth surfaces of bounded external curvature. A.D. Aleksandrov created a theory of general metric manifolds that naturally generalize Riemannian manifolds. In particular, he introduced the class of two-dimensional manifolds of bounded curvature. They exhaust the class of all metrized two-dimensional manifolds that admit, in a neighborhood of each point, a uniform approximation by Riemannian metrics with absolute integral curvature (i.e., the integral of the module of Gaussian curvature) bounded in aggregate./nNaturally, the question arose about the class of surfaces in three-dimensional Euclidean space carrying such a metric with preservation of connections between the metric and the extrinsic geometry of the surface. Partially answering this question, Pogorelov introduced the class of \u04211-smooth surfaces with the requirement on the area of a spherical image to be bounded, taking into account the multiplicity of the covering in some neighborhood of each point of the surface. Such surfaces are called surfaces of bounded extrinsic curvature./nFor such surfaces there is also a very close connection between the intrinsic geometry of the surface and its extrinsic shape: a complete surface with a bounded extrinsic curvature and a nonnegative intrinsic curvature (not equal to zero) is either a closed convex surface or an unbounded convex surface; a complete surface with zero intrinsic curvature and bounded extrinsic curvature is a cylinder./nThe first work of A. V. Pogorelov on surfaces of bounded extrinsic curvature was published in 1953. In 1954, J. Nash published the paper on \u04211-isometric immersions, which was improved by N. Kuiper in 1955. It follows from these studies that a Riemannian metric defined on a two-dimensional manifold, under very general assumptions, admits a realization on a \u04211-smooth surface in a three-dimensional Euclidean space. Moreover, this realization is carried out as freely as a topological immersion into the space of the manifold on which the metric is given. Hence it is clear that for \u04211-surfaces, even with a good intrinsic metric, it is impossible to preserve the connections between the intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures. Even in case if a \u04211-surface carries a regular metric of positive Gaussian curvature, then this does not imply the local convexity of the surface. This emphasizes the naturalness of the class of surfaces of bounded external curvature introduced by Pogorelov./nPogorelov solved Hilbert's fourth problem, set by D. Hilbert at the II International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900. He found all, up to isomorphism, realizations of the systems of axioms of classical geometries (Euclid, Lobachevsky and elliptic) if one omits the congruence axioms containing the concept of angle and supplement these systems with the axiom of \"triangle inequality\"./nPogorelov was one of the first who has proposed (in 1970) a new idea in the construction of a cryoturbogenerator with superconducting field winding and took an active part in technical calculations and creation of corresponding industrial samples./nIn 2015, one of the streets in Kharkiv was named after Pogorelov./nIn 2007, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine founded the Pogorelov Award for the achievements in the field of geometry and topology./nOne of the asteroids is named after Pogorelov: (19919) Pogorelov\u00a0[fr].", "763708": "Herman Heine Goldstine (September 13, 1913 \u2013 June 16, 2004) was a mathematician and computer scientist, who worked as the director of the IAS machine at the Institute for Advanced Study and helped to develop ENIAC, the first of the modern electronic digital computers. He subsequently worked for many years at IBM as an IBM Fellow, the company's most prestigious technical position./nGoldstine was born in Chicago in 1913 to Jewish parents. He attended the University of Chicago, where he joined the Phi Beta Kappa fraternity, and graduated with a degree in Mathematics in 1933, a master's degree in 1934, and a PhD in 1936. For three years he was a research assistant under Gilbert Ames Bliss, an authority on the mathematical theory of external ballistics./nIn 1939 Goldstine began a teaching career at the University of Michigan, until the United States' entry into World War II, when he joined the U.S. Army./nAs a result of the United States' entering World War II, Goldstine left the University of Michigan where he was a professor in July, 1942 to enlist in the Army. He was commissioned a lieutenant and worked as an ordnance mathematician calculating firing tables at the Ballistic Research Laboratory (BRL) at Aberdeen Proving Ground,  Maryland. The firing tables were used in battle to find the appropriate elevation and azimuth for aiming artillery, which had a range of several miles./nThe firing table calculations were accomplished by about one hundred women operating mechanical desk calculators. Each combination of gun, round and geographical region required a unique set of firing tables. It took about 750 calculations to compute a single trajectory and each table had about 3,000 trajectories. It took a human computer at least 7 hours to calculate one trajectory.[1] To increase production, BRL enlisted the computing facilities of the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania and Goldstine was the liaison between BRL and the university./nWhile making some adjustments to the Moore School's mechanical differential analyzer, engineer Joseph Chapline suggested Goldstine visit John Mauchly, a physics instructor at the Moore School, who had distributed a memorandum proposing that the calculations could be done thousands of times faster with an electronic computer using vacuum tubes. Mauchly wrote a proposal and in June 1943 he and Goldstine secured funding from the Army  for the project. The ENIAC was built in 30 months with 200,000 man hours. The ENIAC was huge, measuring 30 by 60 feet and weighing 30 tons with 18,000 vacuum tubes. The device could only store 20 numbers and took days to program. It was completed in late 1945 as World War II was coming to an end./nIn spite of disappointment that ENIAC had not contributed to the war effort, interest remained strong in the Army to develop an electronic computer.  Prior even to the ENIAC's completion, the Army procured a second contract from the Moore School to build a successor machine known as the EDVAC. Goldstine, Mauchly, J. Presper Eckert and Arthur Burks began to study the development of the new machine in the hopes of correcting the deficiencies of the ENIAC./nIn the summer of 1944 Goldstine had a chance encounter with the prominent mathematician John von Neumann on a railway platform in Aberdeen, Maryland, and Goldstine described his project at the University of Pennsylvania. Unknown to Goldstine, von Neumann was then working on the Manhattan Project, which was aiming to build the first atomic bomb. The calculations needed for this project were also daunting./nAs a result of his conversations with Goldstine, von Neumann joined the study group and wrote a memo called First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC.  Von Neumann intended this to be a memo to the study group, but Goldstine typed it up into a 101-page document that named von Neumann as the sole author.  On June 25, 1946, Goldstine forwarded 24 copies of the document to those intimately involved in the EDVAC project; dozens or perhaps hundreds of mimeographs of the report were forwarded to von Neumann's colleagues at universities in the United States and in Great Britain in the weeks that followed.  While incomplete, the paper was very well received and became a blueprint for building electronic digital computers.  Due to von Neumann's prominence as a major American mathematician, the EDVAC architecture became known as the von Neumann architecture./nOne of the key ideas in the \"first draft\" was that the programmer could store a program in the computer's electronic memory, rather than program the computer using mechanical switches and patch cables. This and other ideas in the paper had been discussed in the EDVAC study group before von Neumann joined the group. The fact that Eckert and Mauchly, the actual inventors and designers of the ENIAC, were not named as co-authors created resentment that led to the group's dissolution at the end of the war./nEckert and Mauchly went on to form the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation, a company that in part survives today as the Unisys Corporation, while von Neumann, Goldstine and Burks moved on into academic life at the Institute for Advanced Study. In Summer 1946, all of them were reunited to give presentations at the first computer course, which has come to be known as the Moore School Lectures; Goldstine's presentations, given without notes, covered deeply and rigorously numerical mathematical methods useful in programs for digital computers./nAfter World War II Goldstine joined von Neumann and Burks at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, where they built a computer referred to as the IAS machine. Goldstine was appointed as assistant director of the project and was later its director, after 1954./nThe IAS machine influenced the design of IBM's early computers through von Neumann, who was a consultant to IBM. When von Neumann died in 1957, the IAS computer project was terminated. Goldstine went on to become the founding director of the Mathematical Sciences Department at IBM's Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York./nAt IBM one of Goldstine's most significant roles was in fostering relations between IBM researchers and the academic community. In 1969 he was appointed an IBM Fellow, the company's most prestigious technical honor, and a consultant to the director of research. As a fellow Goldstine developed an interest in the history of computing and mathematical sciences. He wrote three books on the topic; The Computer from Pascal to von Neumann, History of Numerical Analysis from the 16th Through the 19th Century and History of the Calculus of Variations from the Seventeenth Through the Nineteenth Century. As the title implies, in The Computer from Pascal to von Neumann, Goldstine leaves little doubt that in his opinion von Neumann played a critical role in developing modern theories of computing./nIn retirement Goldstine became executive director of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia between 1985 and 1997, in which capacity he was able to attract many prestigious visitors and speakers./nIn 1941 he married Adele Katz, who was an ENIAC programmer and who wrote the technical description for ENIAC.

In particular, he developed new tests to prove the integrability and non-integrability for systems of differential equations and discrete mappings, based on the so-called Painlev\u00e9 expansions in complex time. More importantly, he derived a new form of the Melnikov distance from the local Painleve property that can be used to prove the existence of transverse homoclinic connections, thereby directly relating local multivaluedness in complex time to chaotic dynamics in real-time. He also gave sufficient conditions for the existence of open sets of initial conditions leading to finite-time singularities which cosmologists use to explore possible singularities in cosmological models (such as the expanding general-relativistic Friedmann  universe, brane singularity). These results are summarized in his monograph.[9]/nOver the years, Goriely has made important contributions to the modeling and analysis of filaments. Elastic curves can be modeled through the Kirchhoff equations that take into account bending, shearing, and extension. Within this context, in 1998 he identified a new type of instability driven by curvature. He showed that a torsional instability of filaments under tension can result in the formation of structures with opposite chirality for which he coined the word tendril perversion.[10][11] Other contributions in this area include a complete classification of static solutions, the discovery of new exact dynamical solutions for the Kirchhoff elastic rods, and the development of new geometric methods to prove stability through the positive definiteness of the second variation. With colleagues, he provided a complete classification of uniform equilibria, and built the first three-dimensional theory for the nonlinear dynamics of elastic tubes conveying a fluid, studied the twining of vines, proved the existence of compact waves traveling on nonlinear rods, the inversion of curvature in bacteria, the growth of stems, the mechanics of seed expulsion, the shape and mechanics of proteins, and a full theory of growing and remodeling elastic rods suitable to describe many biological structures. With colleagues, he used this framework to develop a theory of plant tropism that include multiple stimuli.[12][13]/nGoriely  has  worked  in the applications of nonlinear mechanics to the field of biological materials and biological growth. Through his work, he was central in the development of a general mechanical theory of biological growth. This theory, for which he coined the word morphoelasticity,  deals with the physical forces and shapes generated during development, homeostasis, or pathology. At the mathematical level, it is based on the general theory of nonlinear anelasticity. While the basic theoretical framework was understood as early as 1994, in 2005 with Martine Ben Amar, he developed a general stability method for morphoelastic solids and demonstrated that patterns and instabilities can be driven exclusively through growth.[14] He further expanded this aspect of his research to demonstrate the occurrence of growth-induced patterns in many biological and physiological systems such as fungi, bacteria, and microbial cellular blebbing. Together with Derek Moulton and R\u00e9gis Chirat, he  developed a theory to describe morphological patterns for seashells, such as spikes and commarginal ornamentation.[15] His theory of morphoelasticity is developed in his 2017 monograph on growth.[16]/nGoriely made several contributions to  the foundations of classical mechanics and  nonlinear elasticity. With his collaborators, he has given a general exact theory of Euler buckling within three-dimensional nonlinear elasticity,[17] developed new fundamental adscititious inequalities for materials exhibiting the negative Poynting effect,[18] and studied the nonlinear dynamics of shear waves in elastic solids. Since 2012, he  initiated,  with Arash  Yavari, a research programme related to the geometric foundations of mechanics for nonlinear solids. In the absence of defects, solids can be described through the mapping of a reference configuration in the Euclidean space to a current configuration that also sits  in Euclidean space. In the presence of defects, the correct underlying mathematical structure that  describes the reference configuration is a non-Euclidean manifold. These ideas, first presented in the work of  Kazuo Kondo in the 1940s, were known by the mechanics community but had never been used directly to build an effective theory of continuous defects. In this fully geometric theory, first described in their 2012 paper,[19] they show that pure dislocations, disclinations, and point  defects are, respectively, associated with Weitzenbock, Riemann, and\nWeyl manifolds. Further, they used Cartan's moving frames theory  to formulate a complete theory of defects which can be used to obtain exact solutions for a  number of important problems in nonlinear dislocation theory and anelasticity. They used this theory to obtain  the exact nonlinear analogue of Eshelby's celebrated inclusion problem for a spherical  inclusion in an isotropic incompressible nonlinear solid. They also introduced the concept of discombinations  to describe sources of incompatibility related to multiple origins (point, lines, and edge defects).[20]/nGoriely has done  work in the field of materials science and renewable energy, ionic liquids, nano-particles fabrication, supercapacitors, and lithium-ion batteries. In 2013, he initiated a collaboration with Henry Snaith on the development of a new generation of perovskite solar cell. In their 2014 paper,[21] they developed a mathematical model to predict coverage and morphology during the annealing of  a thin solid film of a perovskite absorber. This model predicts the optimum film thickness  and annealing temperature ensuring that it has exactly the right degree of transparency./nSince 2012, Goriely has done some work related to the brain modeling. With his collaborators, he has developed models for axon growth  based on the combined mechanics of microtubules extension, growth cone connection,.[22] At the tissue level, with his collaborators, he developed new constitutive models for brain tissue validated on multi-axial shear experiments using human brain tissues.[23] This work forms the basis for his models of  swelling initiation and propagation showing that the Donnan effect is not sufficient and that swelling is also caused by an osmotic pressure increase driven by non-permeating solutes released by necrotic cells.[24] At the organ level, he proposed the first mechanical models of craniectomy [25] and craniosynostosis [26] through systematic mathematical modeling, analysis and computational simulations in fully segmented brain geometry and explained the thickness asymmetry between gyri and sulci first noted more than 100 years ago by Brodmann.[27] More recently, they developed a model for dementia propagation and showed that atrophy could be modeled through a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient coupling mass removal to toxic proteins [28]  and studied the related cognitive decay.[29]/nGoriely is the author of three books[1]/nHis most cited papers are:", "27502428": "T.

Kasner was the first Jewish person appointed to a faculty position in the sciences at Columbia University.[1] Subsequently, he became an adjunct professor in 1906, and a full professor in 1910, at the university. Differential geometry was his main field of study. In addition to introducing the term \"googol\", he is known also for the Kasner metric and the Kasner polygon.[2]/nKasner's 1899 PhD dissertation at Columbia University was titled The Invariant Theory of the Inversion Group: Geometry upon a Quadric Surface; it was published by the American Mathematical Society in 1900 in their Transactions./nKasner is perhaps best remembered today for introducing the term \"googol.\" In order to pique the interest of children, Kasner sought a name for a very large number: one followed by 100 zeros.  On a walk in the New Jersey Palisades with his nephews, Milton (1911\u20131981)[3] and Edwin Sirotta, Kasner asked for their ideas. Nine-year-old Milton suggested \"googol\".[4]/nIn 1940, with James R. Newman, Kasner co-wrote a non-technical book surveying the field of mathematics, called Mathematics and the Imagination (ISBN\u00a00-486-41703-4). It was in this book that the term \"googol\" was first popularized:/nWords of wisdom are spoken by children at least as often as by scientists. The name \"googol\" was invented by a child (Dr. Kasner's nine-year-old nephew) who was asked to think up a name for a very big number, namely, 1 with a hundred zeros after it. He was very certain that this number was not infinite, and therefore equally certain that it had to have a name. At the same time that he suggested \"googol\" he gave a name for a still larger number: \"Googolplex.\" A googolplex is much larger than a googol, but is still finite, as the inventor of the name was quick to point out. It was suggested that a googolplex should be 1, followed by writing zeros until you get tired. This is a description of what would happen if one actually tried to write a googolplex, but different people get tired at different times and it would never do to have Carnera  a better mathematician than Dr. Einstein, simply because he had more endurance. The googolplex then, is a specific finite number, with so many zeros after the 1 that the number is a googol. A googolplex is much bigger than a googol. You will get some idea of the size of this very large but finite number from the fact that there would not be enough room to write it, if you went to the farthest star, touring all the nebulae and putting down zeros every inch of the way./nThe Internet search engine \"Google\" originated from a misspelling of \"googol\",[6][7][8] and the \"Googleplex\" (the Google company headquarters in Mountain View, California) is similarly derived from googolplex./nKasner was Jewish and was the son of Austrian immigrants.[9]", "8431461": "Alexander Volberg (Russian: \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0412\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0433) is a Russian mathematician.

He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963 \"for his contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles, particularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry principles\".[1]/nA graduate of the Technical University of Berlin, Wigner worked as an assistant to Karl Weissenberg and Richard Becker at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, and David Hilbert at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. Wigner and Hermann Weyl were responsible for introducing group theory into physics, particularly the theory of symmetry in physics. Along the way he performed ground-breaking work in pure mathematics, in which he authored a number of mathematical theorems. In particular, Wigner's theorem is a cornerstone in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. He is also known for his research into the structure of the atomic nucleus. In 1930, Princeton University recruited Wigner, along with John von Neumann, and he moved to the United States, where he obtained citizenship in 1937./nWigner participated in a meeting with Leo Szilard and Albert Einstein that resulted in the Einstein\u2013Szilard letter, which prompted President Franklin D. Roosevelt to initiate the Manhattan Project to develop atomic bombs. Wigner was afraid that the German nuclear weapon project would develop an atomic bomb first. During the Manhattan Project, he led a team whose task was to design nuclear reactors to convert uranium into weapons grade plutonium. At the time, reactors existed only on paper, and no reactor had yet gone critical. Wigner was disappointed that DuPont was given responsibility for the detailed design of the reactors, not just their construction. He became director of research and development at the Clinton Laboratory (now the Oak Ridge National Laboratory) in early 1946, but became frustrated with bureaucratic interference by the Atomic Energy Commission, and returned to Princeton./nIn the postwar period, he served on a number of government bodies, including the National Bureau of Standards from 1947 to 1951, the mathematics panel of the National Research Council from 1951 to 1954, the physics panel of the National Science Foundation, and the influential General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission from 1952 to 1957 and again from 1959 to 1964. In later life, he became more philosophical, and published The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences, his best-known work outside technical mathematics and physics./nWigner Jen\u0151 P\u00e1l was born in Budapest, Austria-Hungary on November 17, 1902, to middle class Jewish parents, Elisabeth Elsa Einhorn and Antal Anton Wigner, a leather tanner. He had an older sister, Berta, known as Biri, and a younger sister Margit, known as Manci,[2] who later married British theoretical physicist Paul Dirac.[3] He was home schooled by a professional teacher until the age of 9, when he started school at the third grade. During this period, Wigner developed an interest in mathematical problems.[4] At the age of 11, Wigner contracted what his doctors believed to be tuberculosis. His parents sent him to live for six weeks in a sanatorium in the Austrian mountains, before the doctors concluded that the diagnosis was mistaken.[5]/nWigner's family was Jewish, but not religiously observant, and his Bar Mitzvah was a secular one. From 1915 through 1919, he studied at the secondary grammar school called Fasori Evang\u00e9likus Gimn\u00e1zium, the school his father had attended. Religious education was compulsory, and he attended classes in Judaism taught by a rabbi.[6] A fellow student was J\u00e1nos von Neumann, who was a year behind Wigner. They both benefited from the instruction of the noted mathematics teacher L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz.[7] In 1919, to escape the B\u00e9la Kun communist regime, the Wigner family briefly fled to Austria, returning to Hungary after Kun's downfall.[8] Partly as a reaction to the prominence of Jews in the Kun regime, the family converted to Lutheranism.[9] Wigner explained later in his life that his family decision to convert to Lutheranism \"was not at heart a religious decision but an anti-communist one\".[9]/nAfter graduating from the secondary school in 1920, Wigner enrolled at the Budapest University of Technical Sciences, known as the M\u0171egyetem. He was not happy with the courses on offer,[10]  and in 1921 enrolled at the Technische Hochschule Berlin (now Technical University of Berlin), where he studied chemical engineering.[11]  He also attended the Wednesday afternoon colloquia of the German Physical Society. These colloquia featured leading researchers including Max Planck, Max von Laue, Rudolf Ladenburg, Werner Heisenberg, Walther Nernst, Wolfgang Pauli, and Albert Einstein.[12] Wigner also met the physicist Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd, who at once became Wigner's closest friend.[13] A third experience in Berlin was formative. Wigner worked at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry (now the Fritz Haber Institute), and there he met Michael Polanyi, who became, after L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz, Wigner's greatest teacher. Polanyi supervised Wigner's DSc thesis, Bildung und Zerfall von Molek\u00fclen (\"Formation and Decay of Molecules\").[14]/nWigner returned to Budapest, where he went to work at his father's tannery, but in 1926, he accepted an offer from Karl Weissenberg at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin. Weissenberg wanted someone to assist him with his work on x-ray crystallography, and Polanyi had recommended Wigner. After six months as Weissenberg's assistant, Wigner went to work for Richard Becker for two semesters. Wigner explored quantum mechanics, studying the work of Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger. He also delved into the group theory of Ferdinand Frobenius and  Eduard Ritter von Weber.[15]/nWigner received a request from Arnold Sommerfeld to work at the University of G\u00f6ttingen as an assistant to the great mathematician David Hilbert. This proved a disappointment, as the aged Hilbert's abilities were failing, and his interests had shifted to logic. Wigner nonetheless studied independently.[16] He laid the foundation for the theory of symmetries in quantum mechanics and in 1927 introduced what is now known as the Wigner D-matrix.[17] Wigner and Hermann Weyl were responsible for introducing group theory into quantum mechanics. The latter had written a standard text, Group Theory and Quantum Mechanics (1928), but it was not easy to understand, especially for younger physicists. Wigner's Group Theory and Its Application to the Quantum Mechanics of Atomic Spectra (1931) made group theory accessible to a wider audience.[18]/nIn these works, Wigner laid the foundation for the theory of symmetries in quantum mechanics.[19] Wigner's theorem proved by Wigner in 1931, is a cornerstone of the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. The theorem specifies how physical symmetries such as rotations, translations, and CPT symmetry are represented on the Hilbert space of states. According to the theorem, any symmetry transformation is represented by a linear and unitary or antilinear and antiunitary transformation of Hilbert space. The representation of a symmetry group on a Hilbert space is either an ordinary representation or a projective representation.[20][21]/nIn the late 1930s, Wigner extended his research into atomic nuclei. By 1929, his papers were drawing notice in the world of physics. In 1930, Princeton University recruited Wigner for a one-year lectureship, at 7 times the salary that he had been drawing in Europe. Princeton recruited von Neumann at the same time.  Jen\u0151 P\u00e1l Wigner and J\u00e1nos von Neumann had collaborated on three papers together in 1928 and two in 1929. They anglicized their first names to \"Eugene\" and \"John\", respectively.[22] When their year was up, Princeton offered a five-year contract as visiting professors for half the year. The Technische Hochschule responded with a teaching assignment for the other half of the year. This was very timely, since the Nazis soon rose to power in Germany.[23] At Princeton in 1934, Wigner introduced his sister Margit \"Manci\" Wigner to the physicist Paul Dirac, with whom she remarried.[24]/nPrinceton did not rehire Wigner when his contract ran out in 1936.[25] Through Gregory Breit, Wigner found new employment at the University of Wisconsin. There, he met his first wife, Amelia Frank, who was a physics student there. However, she died unexpectedly in 1937, leaving Wigner distraught. He therefore accepted a 1938 offer from Princeton to return there.[26] Wigner became a naturalized citizen of the United States on January 8, 1937, and he brought his parents to the United States.[27]/nAlthough he was a professed political amateur, on August 2, 1939, he participated in a meeting with Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd and Albert Einstein that resulted in the Einstein\u2013Szil\u00e1rd letter, which prompted President Franklin D. Roosevelt to initiate the Manhattan Project to develop atomic bombs.[28] Wigner was afraid that the German nuclear weapon project would develop an atomic bomb first, and even refused to have his fingerprints taken because they could be used to track him down if Germany won.[29] \"Thoughts of being murdered,\" he later recalled, \"focus your mind wonderfully.\"[29]/nOn June 4, 1941, Wigner married his second wife, Mary Annette Wheeler, a professor of physics at Vassar College, who had completed her Ph.D. at Yale University in 1932. After the war she taught physics on the faculty of Rutgers University's Douglass College in New Jersey until her retirement in 1964. They remained married until her death in November 1977.[30][31] They had two children, David Wigner and Martha Wigner Upton.[32]/nDuring the Manhattan Project, Wigner led a team that included J. Ernest Wilkins Jr., Alvin M. Weinberg, Katharine Way, Gale Young and Edward Creutz. The group's task was to design the production nuclear reactors that would convert uranium into weapons grade plutonium.  At the time, reactors existed only on paper, and no reactor had yet gone critical. In July 1942, Wigner chose a conservative 100 MW design, with a graphite neutron moderator and water cooling.[33] Wigner was present at a converted rackets court under the stands at the University of Chicago's abandoned Stagg Field on December 2, 1942, when the world's first atomic reactor, Chicago Pile One (CP-1) achieved a controlled nuclear chain reaction.[34]/nWigner was disappointed that DuPont was given responsibility for the detailed design of the reactors, not just their construction. He threatened to resign in February 1943, but was talked out of it by the head of the Metallurgical Laboratory, Arthur Compton, who sent him on vacation instead. As it turned out, a design decision by DuPont to give the reactor additional load tubes for more uranium saved the project when neutron poisoning became a problem.[35] Without the additional tubes, the reactor could have been run at 35% power until the boron impurities in the graphite were burned up and enough plutonium produced to run the reactor at full power; but this would have set the project back a year.[36] During the 1950s, he would even work for DuPont on the Savannah River Site.[35] Wigner did not regret working on the Manhattan Project, and sometimes wished the atomic bomb had been ready a year earlier.[37]/nAn important discovery Wigner made during the project was the Wigner effect. This is a swelling of the graphite moderator caused by the displacement of atoms by neutron radiation.[38] The Wigner effect was a serious problem for the reactors at the Hanford Site in the immediate post-war period, and resulted in production cutbacks and a reactor being shut down entirely.[39] It was eventually discovered that it could be overcome by controlled heating and annealing.[40]/nThrough Manhattan project funding, Wigner and Leonard Eisenbud  also developed an important general approach to nuclear reactions, the Wigner\u2013Eisenbud R-matrix theory, which was published in 1947.[41]/nWigner was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1944 and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1945.[42][43] He accepted a position as the director of research and development at the Clinton Laboratory (now the Oak Ridge National Laboratory) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee in early 1946. Because he did not want to be involved in administrative duties, he became co-director of the laboratory, with James Lum handling the administrative chores as executive director.[44] When the newly created Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) took charge of the laboratory's operations at the start of 1947, Wigner feared that many of the technical decisions would be made in Washington.[45] He also saw the Army's continuation of wartime security policies at the laboratory as a \"meddlesome oversight\", interfering with research.[46] One such incident occurred in March 1947, when the AEC discovered that Wigner's scientists were conducting experiments with a critical mass of uranium-235 when the director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., had forbidden such experiments in August 1946 after the death of Louis Slotin at the Los Alamos Laboratory. Wigner argued that Groves's order had been superseded, but was forced to terminate the experiments, which were completely different from the one that killed Slotin.[47]/nFeeling unsuited to a managerial role in such an environment, he left Oak Ridge in 1947 and returned to Princeton University,[48] although he maintained a consulting role with the facility for many years.[45] In the postwar period, he served on a number of government bodies, including the National Bureau of Standards from 1947 to 1951, the mathematics panel of the National Research Council from 1951 to 1954, the physics panel of the National Science Foundation, and the influential General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission from 1952 to 1957 and again from 1959 to 1964.[49] He also contributed to civil defense.[50]/nWigner was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1950.[51]/nNear the end of his life, Wigner's thoughts turned more philosophical. In 1960, he published a now classic article on the philosophy of mathematics and of physics, which has become his best-known work outside technical mathematics and physics, \"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences\".[52] He argued that biology and cognition could be the origin of physical concepts, as we humans perceive them, and that the happy coincidence that mathematics and physics were so well matched, seemed to be \"unreasonable\" and hard to explain.[52] His original paper has provoked and inspired many responses across a wide range of disciplines. These included Richard Hamming in Computer Science,[53] Arthur Lesk in Molecular Biology,[54] Peter Norvig in data mining,[55] Max Tegmark in Physics,[56] Ivor Grattan-Guinness in Mathematics,[57] and Vela Velupillai in Economics.[58]/nTurning to philosophical questions about the theory of quantum mechanics, Wigner developed a thought experiment (later called Wigner's Friend paradox) to illustrate his belief that consciousness is foundational to the quantum mechanical measurement process. He thereby followed an ontological approach that sets human's consciousness at the center: \"All that quantum mechanics purports to provide are probability connections between subsequent impressions (also called 'apperceptions') of the consciousness\".[59]/nMeasurements are understood as the interactions which create the impressions in our consciousness (and as a result modify the wave function of the \"measured\" physical system), an idea which has been called the \"consciousness causes collapse\" interpretation./nInterestingly, Hugh Everett III (a student of Wigner) discussed Wigner's thought experiment in the introductory part of his 1957 dissertation as an \"amusing, but extremely hypothetical drama\".[60] In an early draft of Everett's work, one also finds a drawing of the Wigner's Friend situation,[61] which must be seen as the first evidence on paper of the thought experiment that was later assigned to be Wigner's. This suggests that Everett must at least have discussed the problem together with Wigner./nIn November 1963, Wigner called for the allocation of 10% of the national defense budget to be spent on nuclear blast shelters and survival resources, arguing that such an expenditure would be less costly than disarmament. Wigner considered a recent Woods Hole study's conclusion that a nuclear strike would kill 20% of Americans to be a very modest projection and that the country could recover from such an attack more quickly than Germany had recovered from the devastation of World War II.[62]/nWigner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963 \"for his contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles, particularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry principles\".[1] The prize was shared that year, with the other half of the award divided between Maria Goeppert-Mayer and J. Hans D. Jensen.[1] Wigner professed that he had never considered the possibility that this might occur, and added: \"I never expected to get my name in the newspapers without doing something wicked.\"[63] He also won the Franklin Medal in 1950,[64] the Enrico Fermi award in 1958,[65] the Atoms for Peace Award in 1959,[66] the Max Planck Medal in 1961,[67] the National Medal of Science in 1969,[68] the Albert Einstein Award in 1972,[69] the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1974,[70] the eponymous Wigner Medal in 1978,[71] and the Herzl Prize in 1982. In 1968 he gave the Josiah Willard Gibbs lecture.[72][73]/nAfter his retirement from Princeton in 1971, Wigner prepared the first edition of Symmetries and Reflections, a collection of philosophical essays, and became more involved in international and political meetings; around this time he became a leader[74] and vocal defender[75] of the Unification Church's annual International Conference on the Unity of the Sciences./nMary died in November 1977. In 1979, Wigner married his third wife, Eileen Clare-Patton (Pat) Hamilton, the widow of physicist Donald Ross Hamilton, the dean of the graduate school at Princeton University, who had died in 1972.[76] In 1992, at the age of 90, he published his memoirs, The Recollections of Eugene P. Wigner with Andrew Szanton. In it, Wigner said: \"The full meaning of life, the collective meaning of all human desires, is fundamentally a mystery beyond our grasp. As a young man, I chafed at this state of affairs. But by now I have made peace with it. I even feel a certain honor to be associated with such a mystery.\"[77] In his collection of essays 'Philosophical Reflections and Syntheses' (1995), he commented: \"It was not possible to formulate the laws of quantum mechanics in a fully consistent way without reference to consciousness.\"[78]/nWigner was credited as a member of the advisory board for the Western Goals Foundation, a private domestic intelligence agency created in the US in 1979 to \"fill the critical gap caused by the crippling of the FBI, the disabling of the House Un-American Activities Committee and the destruction of crucial government files\".[79]/nWigner died of pneumonia at the University Medical Center in Princeton, New Jersey on 1 January 1995.[80]", "61450105": "Mar\u00eda del Pilar D\u00edaz is an Argentine statistician.

In 1989, she was elected to the Riga City Council, and in 1990, to the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR. From 1971 to 1991 \u017ddanoka was also a member of the Communist Party of Latvia,[2] but maintains she was \"not part of the party hierarchy.\"[5]/nFrom 1995 till 2004 \u017ddanoka was co-chairwoman of the Latvian Human Rights Committee (a member of FIDH).[6] She has also been one of the leaders of Equal Rights since it foundation in 1993 and of the For Human Rights in United Latvia alliance.[7]/nIn 1999, \u017ddanoka was banned from running for the Latvian parliament Saeima and deprived of her seat on Riga City Council, because she had participated in two seats of the Communist Party's Audit Committee after the party leadership called for a coup against the elected government of the Latvian SSR in January 1991.[2] Subsequently, she sued Latvia in the European Court of Human Rights.[2] \u017ddanoka argued that the Communist Party was still legal until September 1991 and she had remained because she believed the Communist Party would be part of the democratic, multi-party system and \"considered it dishonest to leave one's party because of hard times.\"[5]/nWith the court case pending, the Latvian parliament decided not to impose restrictions on former members of the Communist Party in the 2004 European Parliament election. \u017ddanoka was elected to the European Parliament in June 2004 and won the court case a few days later with a margin of 5-2.[8] Latvia appealed the decision to the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights on the grounds that Latvia's emergence from totalitarian rule brought about by the occupation of Latvia had not been sufficiently taken into account, and on March 16, 2006, the court ruled 13-4 that \u017ddanoka's rights had not been violated.[9]/nIn 2004, she ran successfully for MEP as a candidate of the largest Russian political bloc in Latvia[7] becoming a member of the Greens\u2013European Free Alliance fraction in the European Parliament.[10] In 2005, \u017ddanoka became one of the founders of the EU Russian-Speakers' Alliance.[11] She also won a seat in 2009.[3]/nOn 11 March 2014, \u017ddanoka and her party organized a rally at the European Commission Representation in Riga in support of the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, participated by about 200 people.[12] In May, \u017ddanoka proposed European Council to classify Ukrainian political bloc Right Sector as a terrorist organization.[13] In response, Ukrainian Congress of Latvia petitioned Ministry of Justice of Latvia to declare the political activities of \u017ddanoka and her party as anti-constitutional.[14]/nA submission was made by another Latvian MEP, K\u0101rlis \u0160adurskis, to the Latvian state prosecutor to investigate \u017ddanoka for undermining the Latvian state in her support for Russia. In his submission, \u0160adurskis pointed to her participation at events organised by \"Essence of Time\" that advocates the restoration of the USSR.[15] The application of \u0160adurskis was rejected by Security Police who did not find a crime in \u017ddanoka's actions.[16]/nIn 2016, \u017ddanoka voted against the European Parliament resolution of 23 November that condemned the use of disinformation and propaganda by Russia and Islamist terrorist organisations and called for strengthening EU\u2019s \"strategic communication\" task force, as well as investing more in awareness raising, education, online and local media, investigative journalism and information literacy.[17] Prior to the vote she distributed a letter to other MEPs, saying that the resolution crosses \"all red lines\" and that Russia's state-sponsored news and information channels are no different to Western media that exhibit \"double standards\", recommending them to watch Russia Today and form their own opinion of the channel.[18]/nIn January 2018 \u017ddanoka left European Parliament and returned to Latvian politics with the intention of running for 2018 Latvian parliamentary election in October.[19] She was named Latvian Russian Union's #1 ticket for Vidzeme Region, but was removed from the list of candidates by the Latvia's Central Election Commission on the same basis that barred her from running in 1999.[20][21] \u017ddanoka contested it in the Administrative District Court, but the court upheld the decision made by the Central Election Commission.[22][23] \u017ddanoka applied to the European Court of Human Rights, which has communicated her application to the Latvian government in 2021.[24]/nIn the 2019 European Parliament election her party received 6.24% of the votes, which gave it one seat at the European Parliament that, again, was filled by \u017ddanoka who personally received 18,098 plusses and was crossed out 739 times.[25] She started serving as vice-chairperson in the Petitions Committee and replacement member in the Employment and Public Affairs Committee and named youth and pre-pension employment, adoption of benefits for young families and equalization of social rights in the European Union as her priorities.[26]/nOn 2 March 2022, she was one of 13 MEPs who voted against condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[27] For this she was eventually forced to leave the European Greens\u2013European Free Alliance group.[28][29] On 13 May, \u017ddanoka and six other people were detained in the Riga Town Hall Square\u00a0[lv] at an unauthorized protest against the demolition of the Monument to the Liberators of Soviet Latvia and Riga from the German Fascist Invaders.[30]/nOn 15 September 2022, she was one of 16 MEPs who voted against condemning President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua for human rights violations, in particular the arrest of Bishop Rolando \u00c1lvarez. [31][32]/n\u017ddanoka has described herself as a social democrat \"combining the good parts of socialism and capitalism\". During perestroika, she advocated for economic reform within the Soviet Union and has called the pro-independence Popular Front of Latvia \"dangerously nationalistic\".[5] For a long time, she opposed the accession of Latvia to the European Union believing that \"complete acceptance of the EU's rules would lead to the destruction of our industry and agriculture\" and that Latvia should be a \"financial bridge between the East and the West\" but gave up her Euroscepticism after attending the 2000 New European Left Forum in Sweden. \u017ddanoka still continues opposing NATO and advocates for the Baltic region to retain its \"historical closeness to Russia\" as a way to avoid the \"destruction of Russia and the whole region\".[5]/n\u017ddanoka has said that during the presidency of Boris Yeltsin she was \"ashamed to admit\" she was Russian, but \"was no longer embarrassed for Russia and its leadership\" when Vladimir Putin became president, although still critical of his state capitalism and corruption.[10] She supports the recognition of Russian as an official language in Latvia and European Union, pointing to the 9 million EU citizens who are native Russian speakers in the Baltic states and Southeast Europe.[33]/nIn 2020, \u017ddanoka, alongside her party members Miroslav Mitrofanov and Andrejs Mamikins, was included in the European Platform for Democratic Elections database of \"biased observers\" for backing disputed elections in Russia and separatist areas in Ukraine.[34]/nOn March 5, 2019 State Security Service (SSS) launched a criminal procedure over incitement to ethnic hatred or discord for \u017ddanoka's remarks at a discussion organized by her at the European Parliament, where she likened the situation of ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in Latvia to Jews prior the World War II.[35][36] The case was terminated by the SSS in 2020, for absence of any crime in \u017ddanoka's remarks.[37]/n\u017ddanoka's participation in the controversial 2014 Crimean referendum as an \"international observer\" in a trip paid by the European Union[38] and her remarks in support of it were criticised by the president of the European Parliament Martin Schulz as \"completely contradictory to the position of the European Parliament and the EU.\" \u017ddanoka responded by pointing out that Schulz is an MEP \"just like she is\", and that only her voters can tell her what to do.[39][40] Co-chairwoman of the Greens/European Free Alliance Rebecca Harms called \u017ddanoka's actions and statements as \"totally unacceptable\" and \"in complete and direct opposition with the very clear position the Greens/EFA group has taken since the outset on this issue\", calling the European Free Alliance to expel \u017ddanoka from its ranks. \u017ddanoka's actions were also condemned by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Latvia Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds, with Ministry's press secretary K\u0101rlis Eihenbaums pointing out that \u017ddanoka did not to represent Latvia nor the EU, as she did not have any official authorization from either.[41]", "53880784": "Valery Alexeev (born 1964)[1] is an American mathematician who is currently the David C.

Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a major breakthrough in theoretical physics. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.[23][24]/nHawking achieved commercial success with several works of popular science in which he discussed his theories and cosmology in general. His book A Brief History of Time appeared on the Sunday Times bestseller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. Hawking was a Fellow of the Royal Society, a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. In 2002, Hawking was ranked number 25 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. He died in 2018 at the age of 76, after having motor neurone disease for more than 50 years./nHawking was born on 8 January 1942[25][26] in Oxford to Frank and Isobel Eileen Hawking (n\u00e9e Walker).[27][28] Hawking's mother was born into a family of doctors in Glasgow, Scotland.[29][30] His wealthy paternal great-grandfather, from Yorkshire, over-extended himself buying farm land and then went bankrupt in the great agricultural depression during the early 20th century.[30] His paternal great-grandmother saved the family from financial ruin by opening a school in their home.[30] Despite their families' financial constraints, both parents attended the University of Oxford, where Frank read medicine and Isobel read Philosophy, Politics and Economics.[28] Isobel worked as a secretary for a medical research institute, and Frank was a medical researcher.[28][31] Hawking had two younger sisters, Philippa and Mary, and an adopted brother, Edward Frank David (1955\u20132003).[32]/nIn 1950, when Hawking's father became head of the division of parasitology at the National Institute for Medical Research, the family moved to St Albans, Hertfordshire.[33][34] In St Albans, the family was considered highly intelligent and somewhat eccentric;[33][35] meals were often spent with each person silently reading a book.[33] They lived a frugal existence in a large, cluttered, and poorly maintained house and travelled in a converted London taxicab.[36][37] During one of Hawking's father's frequent absences working in Africa,[38] the rest of the family spent four months in Mallorca visiting his mother's friend Beryl and her husband, the poet Robert Graves.[39]/nHawking began his schooling at the Byron House School in Highgate, London. He later blamed its \"progressive methods\" for his failure to learn to read while at the school.[40][33] In St Albans, the eight-year-old Hawking attended St Albans High School for Girls for a few months. At that time, younger boys could attend one of the houses.[39][41]/nHawking attended two private (i.e. fee-paying) schools, first Radlett School[41] and from September 1952, St Albans School, Hertfordshire,[26][42] after passing the eleven-plus a year early.[43] The family placed a high value on education.[33] Hawking's father wanted his son to attend Westminster School, but the 13-year-old Hawking was ill on the day of the scholarship examination. His family could not afford the school fees without the financial aid of a scholarship, so Hawking remained at St Albans.[44][45] A positive consequence was that Hawking remained close to a group of friends with whom he enjoyed board games, the manufacture of fireworks, model aeroplanes and boats,[46] and long discussions about Christianity and extrasensory perception.[47] From 1958 on, with the help of the mathematics teacher Dikran Tahta, they built a computer from clock parts, an old telephone switchboard and other recycled components.[48][49]/nAlthough known at school as \"Einstein\", Hawking was not initially successful academically.[50] With time, he began to show considerable aptitude for scientific subjects and, inspired by Tahta, decided to read mathematics at university.[51][52][53] Hawking's father advised him to study medicine, concerned that there were few jobs for mathematics graduates.[54] He also wanted his son to attend University College, Oxford, his own alma mater. As it was not possible to read mathematics there at the time, Hawking decided to study physics and chemistry. Despite his headmaster's advice to wait until the next year, Hawking was awarded a scholarship after taking the examinations in March 1959.[55][56]/nHawking began his university education at University College, Oxford,[26] in October 1959 at the age of 17.[57] For the first eighteen months, he was bored and lonely\u00a0\u2013 he found the academic work \"ridiculously easy\".[58][59] His physics tutor, Robert Berman, later said, \"It was only necessary for him to know that something could be done, and he could do it without looking to see how other people did it.\"[2] A change occurred during his second and third years when, according to Berman, Hawking made more of an effort \"to be one of the boys\". He developed into a popular, lively and witty college-member, interested in classical music and science fiction.[57] Part of the transformation resulted from his decision to join the college boat-club, the University College Boat Club, where he coxed a rowing-crew.[60][61] The rowing-coach at the time noted that Hawking cultivated a daredevil image, steering his crew on risky courses that led to damaged boats.[60][62] Hawking estimated that he studied about 1,000 hours during his three years at Oxford. These unimpressive study habits made sitting his finals a challenge, and he decided to answer only theoretical physics questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge. A first-class degree was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study in cosmology at the University of Cambridge.[63][64] Anxious, he slept poorly the night before the examinations, and the result was on the borderline between first- and second-class honours, making a viva (oral examination) with the Oxford examiners necessary.[64][65]/nHawking was concerned that he was viewed as a lazy and difficult student. So, when asked at the viva to describe his plans, he said, \"If you award me a First, I will go to Cambridge. If I receive a Second, I shall stay in Oxford, so I expect you will give me a First.\"[64][66] He was held in higher regard than he believed; as Berman commented, the examiners \"were intelligent enough to realise they were talking to someone far cleverer than most of themselves\".[64] After receiving a first-class BA degree in physics and completing a trip to Iran with a friend, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in October 1962.[26][67][68]/nHawking's first year as a doctoral student was difficult. He was initially disappointed to find that he had been assigned Dennis William Sciama, one of the founders of modern cosmology, as a supervisor rather than the noted astronomer Fred Hoyle,[69][70] and he found his training in mathematics inadequate for work in general relativity and cosmology.[71] After being diagnosed with motor neurone disease, Hawking fell into a depression\u00a0\u2013 though his doctors advised that he continue with his studies, he felt there was little point.[72] His disease progressed more slowly than doctors had predicted. Although Hawking had difficulty walking unsupported, and his speech was almost unintelligible, an initial diagnosis that he had only two years to live proved unfounded. With Sciama's encouragement, he returned to his work.[73][74] Hawking started developing a reputation for brilliance and brashness when he publicly challenged the work of Fred Hoyle and his student Jayant Narlikar at a lecture in June 1964.[75][76]/nWhen Hawking began his doctoral studies, there was much debate in the physics community about the prevailing theories of the creation of the universe: the Big Bang and Steady State theories.[77] Inspired by Roger Penrose's theorem of a spacetime singularity in the centre of black holes, Hawking applied the same thinking to the entire universe; and, during 1965, he wrote his thesis on this topic.[78][79] Hawking's thesis[80] was approved in 1966.[80] There were other positive developments: Hawking received a research fellowship at Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge;[81] he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology, in March 1966;[82] and his essay \"Singularities and the Geometry of Space\u2013Time\" shared top honours with one by Penrose to win that year's prestigious Adams Prize.[83][82]/nIn his work, and in collaboration with Penrose, Hawking extended the singularity theorem concepts first explored in his doctoral thesis. This included not only the existence of singularities but also the theory that the universe might have started as a singularity. Their joint essay was the runner-up in the 1968 Gravity Research Foundation competition.[84][85] In 1970, they published a proof that if the universe obeys the general theory of relativity and fits any of the models of physical cosmology developed by Alexander Friedmann, then it must have begun as a singularity.[86][87][88] In 1969, Hawking accepted a specially created Fellowship for Distinction in Science to remain at Caius.[89]/nIn 1970, Hawking postulated what became known as the second law of black hole dynamics, that the event horizon of a black hole can never get smaller.[90] With James M. Bardeen and Brandon Carter, he proposed the four laws of black hole mechanics, drawing an analogy with thermodynamics.[91] To Hawking's irritation, Jacob Bekenstein, a graduate student of John Wheeler, went further\u2014and ultimately correctly\u2014to apply thermodynamic concepts literally.[92][93]/nIn the early 1970s, Hawking's work with Carter, Werner Israel, and David C. Robinson strongly supported Wheeler's no-hair theorem, one that states that no matter what the original material from which a black hole is created, it can be completely described by the properties of mass, electrical charge and rotation.[94][95] His essay titled \"Black Holes\" won the Gravity Research Foundation Award in January 1971.[96] Hawking's first book, The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time, written with George Ellis, was published in 1973.[97]/nBeginning in 1973, Hawking moved into the study of quantum gravity and quantum mechanics.[98][97] His work in this area was spurred by a visit to Moscow and discussions with Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich and Alexei Starobinsky, whose work showed that according to the uncertainty principle, rotating black holes emit particles.[99] To Hawking's annoyance, his much-checked calculations produced findings that contradicted his second law, which claimed black holes could never get smaller,[100] and supported Bekenstein's reasoning about their entropy.[99][101]/nHis results, which Hawking presented from 1974, showed that black holes emit radiation, known today as Hawking radiation, which may continue until they exhaust their energy and evaporate.[102][103][104] Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a significant breakthrough in theoretical physics.[105][106][107] Hawking was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1974, a few weeks after the announcement of Hawking radiation. At the time, he was one of the youngest scientists to become a Fellow.[108][109]/nHawking was appointed to the Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Visiting Professorship at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1974. He worked with a friend on the faculty, Kip Thorne,[110][6] and engaged him in a scientific wager about whether the X-ray source Cygnus X-1 was a black hole. The wager was an \"insurance policy\" against the proposition that black holes did not exist.[111] Hawking acknowledged that he had lost the bet in 1990, a bet that was the first of several he was to make with Thorne and others.[112] Hawking had maintained ties to Caltech, spending a month there almost every year since this first visit.[113]/nHawking returned to Cambridge in 1975 to a more academically senior post, as reader in gravitational physics. The mid-to-late 1970s were a period of growing public interest in black holes and the physicists who were studying them. Hawking was regularly interviewed for print and television.[114][115] He also received increasing academic recognition of his work.[116] In 1975, he was awarded both the Eddington Medal and the Pius XI Gold Medal, and in 1976 the Dannie Heineman Prize, the Maxwell Medal and Prize and the Hughes Medal.[117][118] He was appointed a professor with a chair in gravitational physics in 1977.[119] The following year he received the Albert Einstein Medal and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford.[120][116]/nIn 1979, Hawking was elected Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.[116][121] His inaugural lecture in this role was titled: \"Is the End in Sight for Theoretical Physics?\" and proposed N = 8 supergravity as the leading theory to solve many of the outstanding problems physicists were studying.[122] His promotion coincided with a health-crisis which led to his accepting, albeit reluctantly, some nursing services at home.[123] At the same time, he was also making a transition in his approach to physics, becoming more intuitive and speculative rather than insisting on mathematical proofs. \"I would rather be right than rigorous\", he told Kip Thorne.[124] In 1981, he proposed that information in a black hole is irretrievably lost when a black hole evaporates. This information paradox violates the fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics, and led to years of debate, including \"the Black Hole War\" with Leonard Susskind and Gerard 't Hooft.[125][126]/nCosmological inflation\u00a0\u2013 a theory proposing that following the Big Bang, the universe initially expanded incredibly rapidly before settling down to a slower expansion\u00a0\u2013 was proposed by Alan Guth and also developed by Andrei Linde.[127] Following a conference in Moscow in October 1981, Hawking and Gary Gibbons[6] organised a three-week Nuffield Workshop in the summer of 1982 on \"The Very Early Universe\" at Cambridge University, a workshop that focused mainly on inflation theory.[128][129][130] Hawking also began a new line of quantum-theory research into the origin of the universe. In 1981 at a Vatican conference, he presented work suggesting that there might be no boundary\u00a0\u2013 or beginning or ending\u00a0\u2013 to the universe.[131][132]/nHawking subsequently developed the research in collaboration with Jim Hartle,[6] and in 1983 they published a model, known as the Hartle\u2013Hawking state. It proposed that prior to the Planck epoch, the universe had no boundary in space-time; before the Big Bang, time did not exist and the concept of the beginning of the universe is meaningless.[133] The initial singularity of the classical Big Bang models was replaced with a region akin to the North Pole. One cannot travel north of the North Pole, but there is no boundary there\u00a0\u2013 it is simply the point where all north-running lines meet and end.[134][135] Initially, the no-boundary proposal predicted a closed universe, which had implications about the existence of God. As Hawking explained, \"If the universe has no boundaries but is self-contained... then God would not have had any freedom to choose how the universe began.\"[136]/nHawking did not rule out the existence of a Creator, asking in A Brief History of Time \"Is the unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence?\",[137] also stating \"If we discover a complete theory, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason\u00a0\u2013 for then we should know the mind of God\";[138] in his early work, Hawking spoke of God in a metaphorical sense. In the same book he suggested that the existence of God was not necessary to explain the origin of the universe. Later discussions with Neil Turok led to the realisation that the existence of God was also compatible with an open universe.[139]/nFurther work by Hawking in the area of arrows of time led to the 1985 publication of a paper theorising that if the no-boundary proposition were correct, then when the universe stopped expanding and eventually collapsed, time would run backwards.[140] A paper by Don Page and independent calculations by Raymond Laflamme led Hawking to withdraw this concept.[141] Honours continued to be awarded: in 1981 he was awarded the American Franklin Medal,[142] and in the 1982 New Year Honours appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).[143][144][145] These awards did not significantly change Hawking's financial status, and motivated by the need to finance his children's education and home-expenses, he decided in 1982 to write a popular book about the universe that would be accessible to the general public.[146][147] Instead of publishing with an academic press, he signed a contract with Bantam Books, a mass-market publisher, and received a large advance for his book.[148][149] A first draft of the book, called A Brief History of Time, was completed in 1984.[150]/nOne of the first messages Hawking produced with his speech-generating device was a request for his assistant to help him finish writing A Brief History of Time.[151] Peter Guzzardi, his editor at Bantam, pushed him to explain his ideas clearly in non-technical language, a process that required many revisions from an increasingly irritated Hawking.[152] The book was published in April 1988 in the US and in June in the UK, and it proved to be an extraordinary success, rising quickly to the top of best-seller lists in both countries and remaining there for months.[153][154][155] The book was translated into many languages,[156] and as of 2009, has sold an estimated 9\u00a0million copies.[155]/nMedia attention was intense,[156] and a Newsweek magazine-cover and a television special both described him as \"Master of the Universe\".[157] Success led to significant financial rewards, but also the challenges of celebrity status.[158] Hawking travelled extensively to promote his work, and enjoyed partying and dancing into the small hours.[156] A difficulty refusing the invitations and visitors left him limited time for work and his students.[159] Some colleagues were resentful of the attention Hawking received, feeling it was due to his disability.[160][161]/nHe received further academic recognition, including five more honorary degrees,[157] the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1985),[162] the Paul Dirac Medal (1987)[157] and, jointly with Penrose, the prestigious Wolf Prize (1988).[163] In the 1989 Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH).[159][164] He reportedly declined a knighthood in the late 1990s in objection to the UK's science funding policy.[165][166]/nHawking pursued his work in physics: in 1993 he co-edited a book on Euclidean quantum gravity with Gary Gibbons and published a collected edition of his own articles on black holes and the Big Bang.[167] In 1994, at Cambridge's Newton Institute, Hawking and Penrose delivered a series of six lectures that were published in 1996 as \"The Nature of Space and Time\".[168] In 1997, he conceded a 1991 public scientific wager made with Kip Thorne and John Preskill of Caltech. Hawking had bet that Penrose's proposal of a \"cosmic censorship conjecture\"\u00a0\u2013 that there could be no \"naked singularities\" unclothed within a horizon\u00a0\u2013 was correct.[169]/nAfter discovering his concession might have been premature, a new and more refined wager was made. This one specified that such singularities would occur without extra conditions.[170] The same year, Thorne, Hawking and Preskill made another bet, this time concerning the black hole information paradox.[171][172] Thorne and Hawking argued that since general relativity made it impossible for black holes to radiate and lose information, the mass-energy and information carried by Hawking radiation must be \"new\", and not from inside the black hole event horizon. Since this contradicted the quantum mechanics of microcausality, quantum mechanics theory would need to be rewritten. Preskill argued the opposite, that since quantum mechanics suggests that the information emitted by a black hole relates to information that fell in at an earlier time, the concept of black holes given by general relativity must be modified in some way.[173]/nHawking also maintained his public profile, including bringing science to a wider audience. A film version of A Brief History of Time, directed by Errol Morris and produced by Steven Spielberg, premiered in 1992. Hawking had wanted the film to be scientific rather than biographical, but he was persuaded otherwise. The film, while a critical success, was not widely released.[174] A popular-level collection of essays, interviews, and talks titled Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays was published in 1993,[175] and a six-part television series Stephen Hawking's Universe and a companion book appeared in 1997. As Hawking insisted, this time the focus was entirely on science.[176][177]/nHawking continued his writings for a popular audience, publishing The Universe in a Nutshell in 2001,[178] and A Briefer History of Time, which he wrote in 2005 with Leonard Mlodinow to update his earlier works with the aim of making them accessible to a wider audience, and God Created the Integers, which appeared in 2006.[179] Along with Thomas Hertog at CERN and Jim Hartle, from 2006 on Hawking developed a theory of top-down cosmology, which says that the universe had not one unique initial state but many different ones, and therefore that it is inappropriate to formulate a theory that predicts the universe's current configuration from one particular initial state.[180] Top-down cosmology posits that the present \"selects\" the past from a superposition of many possible histories. In doing so, the theory suggests a possible resolution of the fine-tuning question.[181][182]/nHawking continued to travel widely, including trips to Chile, Easter Island, South Africa, Spain (to receive the Fonseca Prize in 2008),[183][184] Canada,[185] and numerous trips to the United States.[186] For practical reasons related to his disability, Hawking increasingly travelled by private jet, and by 2011 that had become his only mode of international travel.[187]/nBy 2003, consensus among physicists was growing that Hawking was wrong about the loss of information in a black hole.[188] In a 2004 lecture in Dublin, he conceded his 1997 bet with Preskill, but described his own, somewhat controversial solution to the information paradox problem, involving the possibility that black holes have more than one topology.[189][173] In the 2005 paper he published on the subject, he argued that the information paradox was explained by examining all the alternative histories of universes, with the information loss in those with black holes being cancelled out by those without such loss.[172][190] In January 2014, he called the alleged loss of information in black holes his \"biggest blunder\".[191]/nAs part of another longstanding scientific dispute, Hawking had emphatically argued, and bet, that the Higgs boson would never be found.[192] The particle was proposed to exist as part of the Higgs field theory by Peter Higgs in 1964. Hawking and Higgs engaged in a heated and public debate over the matter in 2002 and again in 2008, with Higgs criticising Hawking's work and complaining that Hawking's \"celebrity status gives him instant credibility that others do not have.\"[193] The particle was discovered in July 2012 at CERN following construction of the Large Hadron Collider. Hawking quickly conceded that he had lost his bet[194][195] and said that Higgs should win the Nobel Prize for Physics,[196] which he did in 2013.[197]/nIn 2007, Hawking and his daughter Lucy published George's Secret Key to the Universe, a children's book designed to explain theoretical physics in an accessible fashion and featuring characters similar to those in the Hawking family.[198] The book was followed by sequels in 2009, 2011, 2014 and 2016.[199]/nIn 2002, following a UK-wide vote, the BBC included Hawking in their list of the 100 Greatest Britons.[200] He was awarded the Copley Medal from the Royal Society (2006),[201] the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is America's highest civilian honour (2009),[202] and the Russian Special Fundamental Physics Prize (2013).[203]/nSeveral buildings have been named after him, including the Stephen W. Hawking Science Museum in San Salvador, El\u00a0Salvador,[204] the Stephen Hawking Building in Cambridge,[205] and the Stephen Hawking Centre at the Perimeter Institute in Canada.[206] Appropriately, given Hawking's association with time, he unveiled the mechanical \"Chronophage\" (or time-eating) Corpus Clock at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge in September 2008.[207][208]/nDuring his career, Hawking supervised 39 successful PhD students.[1] One doctoral student did not successfully complete the PhD.[1][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] As required by Cambridge University policy, Hawking retired as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 2009.[121][209] Despite suggestions that he might leave the United Kingdom as a protest against public funding cuts to basic scientific research,[210] Hawking worked as director of research at the Cambridge University Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics.[211]/nOn 28 June 2009, as a tongue-in-cheek test of his 1992 conjecture that travel into the past is effectively impossible, Hawking held a party open to all, complete with hors d'oeuvres and iced champagne, but publicised the party only after it was over so that only time-travellers would know to attend; as expected, nobody showed up to the party.[212]/nOn 20 July 2015, Hawking helped launch Breakthrough Initiatives, an effort to search for extraterrestrial life.[213] Hawking created Stephen Hawking: Expedition New Earth, a documentary on space colonisation, as a 2017 episode of Tomorrow's World.[214][215]/nIn August 2015, Hawking said that not all information is lost when something enters a black hole and there might be a possibility to retrieve information from a black hole according to his theory.[216] In July 2017, Hawking was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Imperial College London.[217]/nHawking's final paper \u2013 A smooth exit from eternal inflation? \u2013 was posthumously published in the Journal of High Energy Physics on 27 April 2018.[218][219]/nHawking met his future wife, Jane Wilde, at a party in 1962. The following year, Hawking was diagnosed with motor neurone disease. In October 1964, the couple became engaged to marry, aware of the potential challenges that lay ahead due to Hawking's shortened life expectancy and physical limitations.[120][220] Hawking later said that the engagement gave him \"something to live for\".[221] The two were married on 14 July 1965 in their shared hometown of St Albans.[81]/nThe couple resided in Cambridge, within Hawking's walking distance to the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP). During their first years of marriage, Jane lived in London during the week as she completed her degree at Westfield College. They travelled to the United States several times for conferences and physics-related visits. Jane began a PhD programme through Westfield College in medieval Spanish poetry (completed in 1981). The couple had three children: Robert, born May 1967,[222][223] Lucy, born November 1970,[224] and Timothy, born April 1979.[116]/nHawking rarely discussed his illness and physical challenges\u2014even, in a precedent set during their courtship, with Jane.[225] His disabilities meant that the responsibilities of home and family rested firmly on his wife's increasingly overwhelmed shoulders, leaving him more time to think about physics.[226] Upon his appointment in 1974 to a year-long position at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, Jane proposed that a graduate or post-doctoral student live with them and help with his care. Hawking accepted, and Bernard Carr travelled with them as the first of many students who fulfilled this role.[227][228] The family spent a generally happy and stimulating year in Pasadena.[229]/nHawking returned to Cambridge in 1975 to a new home and a new job, as reader. Don Page, with whom Hawking had begun a close friendship at Caltech, arrived to work as the live-in graduate student assistant. With Page's help and that of a secretary, Jane's responsibilities were reduced so she could return to her doctoral thesis and her new interest in singing.[230]/nAround December 1977, Jane met organist Jonathan Hellyer Jones when singing in a church choir. Hellyer Jones became close to the Hawking family and, by the mid-1980s, he and Jane had developed romantic feelings for each other.[119][231][232] According to Jane, her husband was accepting of the situation, stating \"he would not object so long as I continued to love him\".[119][233][234] Jane and Hellyer Jones were determined not to break up the family, and their relationship remained platonic for a long period.[235]/nBy the 1980s, Hawking's marriage had been strained for many years. Jane felt overwhelmed by the intrusion into their family life of the required nurses and assistants.[236] The impact of his celebrity status was challenging for colleagues and family members, while the prospect of living up to a worldwide fairytale image was daunting for the couple.[237][181] Hawking's views of religion also contrasted with her strong Christian faith and resulted in tension.[181][238][239] After a tracheotomy in 1985, Hawking required a full-time nurse and nursing care was split across three shifts daily. In the late 1980s, Hawking grew close to one of his nurses, Elaine Mason, to the dismay of some colleagues, caregivers, and family members, who were disturbed by her strength of personality and protectiveness.[240] In February 1990, Hawking told Jane that he was leaving her for Mason[241] and departed the family home.[143] After his divorce from Jane in 1995, Hawking married Mason in September,[143][242] declaring, \"It's wonderful\u00a0\u2013 I have married the woman I love.\"[243]/nIn 1999, Jane Hawking published a memoir, Music to Move the Stars, describing her marriage to Hawking and its breakdown. Its revelations caused a sensation in the media but, as was his usual practice regarding his personal life, Hawking made no public comment except to say that he did not read biographies about himself.[244] After his second marriage, Hawking's family felt excluded and marginalised from his life.[239] For a period of about five years in the early 2000s, his family and staff became increasingly worried that he was being physically abused.[245] Police investigations took place, but were closed as Hawking refused to make a complaint.[246]/nIn 2006, Hawking and Mason quietly divorced,[247][248] and Hawking resumed closer relationships with Jane, his children, and his grandchildren.[181][248] Reflecting on this happier period, a revised version of Jane's book, re-titled Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen, appeared in 2007,[246] and was made into a film, The Theory of Everything, in 2014.[249]/nHawking had a rare early-onset, slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease (MND; also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's disease), a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects the motor neurones in the brain and spinal cord, which gradually paralysed him over decades.[21]/nHawking had experienced increasing clumsiness during his final year at Oxford, including a fall on some stairs and difficulties when rowing.[250][251] The problems worsened, and his speech became slightly slurred. His family noticed the changes when he returned home for Christmas, and medical investigations were begun.[252][253] The MND diagnosis came when Hawking was 21, in 1963. At the time, doctors gave him a life expectancy of two years.[254][255]/nIn the late 1960s, Hawking's physical abilities declined: he began to use crutches and could no longer give lectures regularly.[256] As he slowly lost the ability to write, he developed compensatory visual methods, including seeing equations in terms of geometry.[257][258] The physicist Werner Israel later compared the achievements to Mozart composing an entire symphony in his head.[259][260] Hawking was fiercely independent and unwilling to accept help or make concessions for his disabilities. He preferred to be regarded as \"a scientist first, popular science writer second, and, in all the ways that matter, a normal human being with the same desires, drives, dreams, and ambitions as the next person.\"[261] His wife Jane later noted: \"Some people would call it determination, some obstinacy. I've called it both at one time or another.\"[262] He required much persuasion to accept the use of a wheelchair at the end of the 1960s,[263] but ultimately became notorious for the wildness of his wheelchair driving.[264] Hawking was a popular and witty colleague, but his illness, as well as his reputation for brashness, distanced him from some.[262]/nWhen Hawking first began using a wheelchair he was using standard motorised models. The earliest surviving example of these chairs was made by BEC Mobility and sold by Christie's in November 2018 for \u00a3296,750.[265] Hawking continued to use this type of chair until the early 1990s, at which time his ability to use his hands to drive a wheelchair deteriorated. Hawking used a variety of different chairs from that time, including a DragonMobility Dragon elevating powerchair from 2007, as shown in the April 2008 photo of Hawking attending NASA's 50th anniversary;[266] a Permobil C350 from 2014; and then a Permobil F3 from 2016.[267]/nHawking's speech deteriorated, and by the late 1970s he could be understood by only his family and closest friends. To communicate with others, someone who knew him well would interpret his speech into intelligible speech.[268] Spurred by a dispute with the university over who would pay for the ramp needed for him to enter his workplace, Hawking and his wife campaigned for improved access and support for those with disabilities in Cambridge,[269][270] including adapted student housing at the university.[271] In general, Hawking had ambivalent feelings about his role as a disability rights champion: while wanting to help others, he also sought to detach himself from his illness and its challenges.[272] His lack of engagement in this area led to some criticism.[273]/nDuring a visit to CERN on the border of France and Switzerland in mid-1985, Hawking contracted pneumonia, which in his condition was life-threatening; he was so ill that Jane was asked if life support should be terminated. She refused, but the consequence was a tracheotomy, which required round-the-clock nursing care and caused the loss of what remained of his speech.[274][275] The National Health Service was ready to pay for a nursing home, but Jane was determined that he would live at home. The cost of the care was funded by an American foundation.[276][277] Nurses were hired for the three shifts required to provide the round-the-clock support he required. One of those employed was Elaine Mason, who was to become Hawking's second wife.[278]/nFor his communication, Hawking initially raised his eyebrows to choose letters on a spelling card,[279] but in 1986 he received a computer program called the \"Equalizer\" from Walter Woltosz, CEO of Words Plus, who had developed an earlier version of the software to help his mother-in-law, who also had ALS and had lost her ability to speak and write.[280] In a method he used for the rest of his life, Hawking could now simply press a switch to select phrases, words or letters from a bank of about 2,500\u20133,000 that were scanned.[281][282] The program was originally run on a desktop computer. Elaine Mason's husband, David, a computer engineer, adapted a small computer and attached it to his wheelchair.[283]/nReleased from the need to use somebody to interpret his speech, Hawking commented that \"I can communicate better now than before I lost my voice.\"[284] The voice he used had an American accent and is no longer produced.[285][286] Despite the later availability of other voices, Hawking retained this original voice, saying that he preferred it and identified with it.[287] Originally, Hawking activated a switch using his hand and could produce up to 15 words per minute.[151] Lectures were prepared in advance and were sent to the speech synthesiser in short sections to be delivered.[285]/nHawking gradually lost the use of his hand, and in 2005 he began to control his communication device with movements of his cheek muscles,[288][289][290] with a rate of about one word per minute.[289] With this decline there was a risk of him developing locked-in syndrome, so Hawking collaborated with Intel Corporation researchers on systems that could translate his brain patterns or facial expressions into switch activations. After several prototypes that did not perform as planned, they settled on an adaptive word predictor made by the London-based startup SwiftKey, which used a system similar to his original technology. Hawking had an easier time adapting to the new system, which was further developed after inputting large amounts of Hawking's papers and other written materials and uses predictive software similar to other smartphone keyboards.[181][280][290][291]/nBy 2009, he could no longer drive his wheelchair independently, but the same people who created his new typing mechanics were working on a method to drive his chair using movements made by his chin. This proved difficult, since Hawking could not move his neck, and trials showed that while he could indeed drive the chair, the movement was sporadic and jumpy.[280][292] Near the end of his life, Hawking experienced increased breathing difficulties, often resulting in his requiring the usage of a ventilator, and being regularly hospitalised.[181]/nStarting in the 1990s, Hawking accepted the mantle of role model for disabled people, lecturing and participating in fundraising activities.[293] At the turn of the century, he and eleven other humanitarians signed the Charter for the Third Millennium on Disability, which called on governments to prevent disability and protect the rights of disabled people.[294][295] In 1999, Hawking was awarded the Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize of the American Physical Society.[296]/nIn August 2012, Hawking narrated the \"Enlightenment\" segment of the 2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony in London.[297] In 2013, the biographical documentary film Hawking, in which Hawking himself is featured, was released.[298] In September 2013, he expressed support for the legalisation of assisted suicide for the terminally ill.[299] In August 2014, Hawking accepted the Ice Bucket Challenge to promote ALS/MND awareness and raise contributions for research. As he had pneumonia in 2013, he was advised not to have ice poured over him, but his children volunteered to accept the challenge on his behalf.[300]/nIn late 2006, Hawking revealed in a BBC interview that one of his greatest unfulfilled desires was to travel to space;[301] on hearing this, Richard Branson offered a free flight into space with Virgin Galactic, which Hawking immediately accepted. Besides personal ambition, he was motivated by the desire to increase public interest in spaceflight and to show the potential of people with disabilities.[302] On 26 April 2007, Hawking flew aboard a specially-modified Boeing 727\u2013200 jet operated by Zero-G Corp off the coast of Florida to experience weightlessness.[303] Fears that the manoeuvres would cause him undue discomfort proved incorrect, and the flight was extended to eight parabolic arcs.[301] It was described as a successful test to see if he could withstand the g-forces involved in space flight.[304] At the time, the date of Hawking's trip to space was projected to be as early as 2009, but commercial flights to space did not commence before his death.[305]/nHawking died at his home in Cambridge on 14 March 2018, at the age of 76.[306][307][308] His family stated that he \"died peacefully\".[309][310] He was eulogised by figures in science, entertainment, politics, and other areas.[311][312][313][314] The Gonville and Caius College flag flew at half-mast and a book of condolences was signed by students and visitors.[315][316][317] A tribute was made to Hawking in the closing speech by IPC President Andrew Parsons at the closing ceremony of the 2018 Paralympic Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.[318]/nHis private funeral took place on 31 March 2018,[319] at Great St Mary's Church, Cambridge.[319][320] Guests at the funeral included The Theory of Everything actors Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones, Queen guitarist and astrophysicist Brian May, and model Lily Cole.[321][322] In addition, actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Stephen Hawking in Hawking, astronaut Tim Peake, Astronomer Royal Martin Rees and physicist Kip Thorne provided readings at the service.[323] Although Hawking was an atheist, the funeral took place with a traditional Anglican service.[324][325] Following the cremation, a service of thanksgiving was held at Westminster Abbey on 15 June 2018, after which his ashes were interred in the Abbey's nave, between the graves of Sir Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin.[16][321][326][327]/nInscribed on his memorial stone are the words \"Here lies what was mortal of Stephen Hawking 1942\u20132018\" and his most famed equation.[328] He directed, at least fifteen years before his death, that the Bekenstein\u2013Hawking entropy equation be his epitaph.[329][330][note 1] In June 2018, it was announced that Hawking's words, set to music by Greek composer Vangelis, would be beamed into space from a European space agency satellite dish in Spain with the aim of reaching the nearest black hole, 1A 0620-00.[335]/nHawking's final broadcast interview, about the detection of gravitational waves resulting from the collision of two neutron stars, occurred in October 2017.[336] His final words to the world appeared posthumously, in April 2018, in the form of a Smithsonian TV Channel documentary entitled, Leaving Earth: Or How to Colonize a Planet.[337][338] One of his final research studies, entitled A smooth exit from eternal inflation?, about the origin of the universe, was published in the Journal of High Energy Physics in May 2018.[339][218][340] Later, in October 2018, another of his final research studies, entitled Black Hole Entropy and Soft Hair,[341] was published, and dealt with the \"mystery of what happens to the information held by objects once they disappear into a black hole\".[342][343] Also in October 2018, Hawking's last book, Brief Answers to the Big Questions, a popular science book presenting his final comments on the most important questions facing humankind, was published.[344][345][346]/nOn 8 November 2018, an auction of 22 personal possessions of Stephen Hawking, including his doctoral thesis (\"Properties of Expanding Universes\", PhD thesis, Cambridge University, 1965) and wheelchair, took place, and fetched about \u00a31.8\u00a0m.[347][348] Proceeds from the auction sale of the wheelchair went to two charities, the Motor Neurone Disease Association and the Stephen Hawking Foundation;[349] proceeds from Hawking's other items went to his estate.[348]/nIn March 2019, it was announced that the Royal Mint would issue a commemorative 50p coin, only available as a commemorative edition,[350] in honour of Hawking.[351] The same month, Hawking's nurse, Patricia Dowdy, was struck off the nursing register for \"failures over his care and financial misconduct.\"[352]/nIn May 2021 it was announced that an Acceptance-in-Lieu agreement between HMRC, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, Cambridge University Library, Science Museum Group, and the Hawking Estate, would see around 10,000 pages of Hawking's scientific and other papers remain in Cambridge, while objects including his wheelchairs, speech synthesisers, and personal memorabilia from his former Cambridge office would be housed at the Science Museum.[353] In February 2022 the \"Stephen Hawking at Work\" display opened at the Science Museum, London as the start of a two-year nationwide tour.[354]/nAt Google's Zeitgeist Conference in 2011, Stephen Hawking said that \"philosophy is dead\". He believed that philosophers \"have not kept up with modern developments in science\", \"have not taken science sufficiently seriously and so Philosophy is no longer relevant to knowledge claims\", \"their art is dead\" and that scientists \"have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge\". He said that philosophical problems can be answered by science, particularly new scientific theories which \"lead us to a new and very different picture of the universe and our place in it\".[355] His view was both praised and criticized.[356]/nIn 2006, Hawking posed an open question on the Internet: \"In a world that is in chaos politically, socially and environmentally, how can the human race sustain another 100 years?\", later clarifying: \"I don't know the answer. That is why I asked the question, to get people to think about it, and to be aware of the dangers we now face.\"[357]/nHawking expressed concern that life on Earth is at risk from a sudden nuclear war, a genetically engineered virus, global warming, or other dangers humans have not yet thought of.[302][358] Hawking stated: \"I regard it as almost inevitable that either a nuclear confrontation or environmental catastrophe will cripple the Earth at some point in the next 1,000 years\", and considered an \"asteroid collision\" to be the biggest threat to the planet.[344] Such a planet-wide disaster need not result in human extinction if the human race were to be able to colonise additional planets before the disaster.[358] Hawking viewed spaceflight and the colonisation of space as necessary for the future of humanity.[302][359]/nHawking stated that, given the vastness of the universe, aliens likely exist, but that contact with them should be avoided.[360][361] He warned that aliens might pillage Earth for resources. In 2010 he said, \"If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans.\"[361]/nHawking warned that superintelligent artificial intelligence could be pivotal in steering humanity's fate, stating that \"the potential benefits are huge... Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history. It might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks.\"[362][363] He was fearing that \"an extremely intelligent future AI will probably develop a drive to survive and acquire more resources as a step toward accomplishing whatever goal it has\", and that \"The real risk with AI isn't malice but competence. A super-intelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren't aligned with ours, we're in trouble\".[364] He also considered that the enormous wealth generated by machines needs to be redistributed to prevent exacerbated economic inequality.[364]/nHawking was concerned about the future emergence of a race of \"superhumans\" that would be able to design their own evolution[344] and, as well, argued that computer viruses in today's world should be considered a new form of life, stating that \"maybe it says something about human nature, that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. Talk about creating life in our own image.\"[365]/nHawking was an atheist.[366][367] In an interview published in The Guardian, Hawking regarded \"the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail\", and the concept of an afterlife as a \"fairy story for people afraid of the dark\".[307][138] In 2011, narrating the first episode of the American television series Curiosity on the Discovery Channel, Hawking declared:/nWe are each free to believe what we want and it is my view that the simplest explanation is there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realisation. There is probably no heaven, and no afterlife either. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that, I am extremely grateful.[368][369]/nHawking's association with atheism and freethinking was in evidence from his university years onwards, when he had been a member of Oxford University's humanist group. He was later scheduled to appear as the keynote speaker at a 2017 Humanists UK conference.[370] In an interview with El Mundo, he said:/nBefore we understand science, it is natural to believe that God created the universe. But now science offers a more convincing explanation. What I meant by 'we would know the mind of God' is, we would know everything that God would know, if there were a God, which there isn't. I'm an atheist.[366]/nIn addition, Hawking stated:/nIf you like, you can call the laws of science 'God', but it wouldn't be a personal God that you would meet and put questions to.[344]/nHawking was a longstanding Labour Party supporter.[371][372] He recorded a tribute for the 2000 Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore,[373] called the 2003 invasion of Iraq a \"war crime\",[372][374]  campaigned for nuclear disarmament,[371][372] and supported stem cell research,[372][375] universal health care,[376] and action to prevent climate change.[377] In August 2014, Hawking was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's referendum on that issue.[378] Hawking believed a United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit) would damage the UK's contribution to science as modern research needs international collaboration, and that free movement of people in Europe encourages the spread of ideas.[379] Hawking said to Theresa May, \"I deal with tough mathematical questions every day, but please don't ask me to help with Brexit.\"[380]  Hawking was disappointed by Brexit and warned against envy and isolationism.[381]/nHawking was greatly concerned over health care, and maintained that without the UK National Health Service, he could not have survived into his 70s.[382] Hawking especially feared privatisation. He stated, \"The more profit is extracted from the system, the more private monopolies grow and the more expensive healthcare becomes. The NHS must be preserved from commercial interests and protected from those who want to privatise it.\"[383] Hawking blamed the Conservatives for cutting funding to the NHS, weakening it by privatisation, lowering staff morale through holding pay back and reducing social care.[384] Hawking accused Jeremy Hunt of cherry picking evidence which Hawking maintained debased science.[382] Hawking also stated, \"There is overwhelming evidence that NHS funding and the numbers of doctors and nurses are inadequate, and it is getting worse.\"[385]\nIn June 2017, Hawking endorsed the Labour Party in the 2017 UK general election, citing the Conservatives' proposed cuts to the NHS. But he was also critical of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, expressing scepticism over whether the party could win a general election under him.[386]/nHawking feared Donald Trump's policies on global warming could endanger the planet and make global warming irreversible. He said, \"Climate change is one of the great dangers we face, and it's one we can prevent if we act now. By denying the evidence for climate change, and pulling out of the Paris Agreement, Donald Trump will cause avoidable environmental damage to our beautiful planet, endangering the natural world, for us and our children.\"[387] Hawking further stated that this could lead Earth \"to become like Venus, with a temperature of two hundred and fifty degrees, and raining sulphuric acid\".[388]/nHawking was also a supporter of a universal basic income.[389] He was critical of the Israeli government's position on the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, stating that their policy \"is likely to lead to disaster.\"[390]/nIn 1988, Hawking, Arthur C. Clarke and Carl Sagan were interviewed in God, the Universe and Everything Else. They discussed the Big Bang theory, God and the possibility of extraterrestrial life.[391]/nAt the release party for the home video version of the A Brief History of Time, Leonard Nimoy, who had played Spock on Star Trek, learned that Hawking was interested in appearing on the show. Nimoy made the necessary contact, and Hawking played a holographic simulation of himself in an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation in 1993.[392][393] The same year, his synthesiser voice was recorded for the Pink Floyd song \"Keep Talking\",[394][175] and in 1999 for an appearance on The Simpsons.[395] Hawking appeared in documentaries titled The Real Stephen Hawking (2001),[295] Stephen Hawking: Profile (2002)[396] and Hawking (2013), and the documentary series Stephen Hawking, Master of the Universe (2008).[397] Hawking also guest-starred in Futurama[181] and had a recurring role in The Big Bang Theory.[398]/nHawking allowed the use of his copyrighted voice[399][400] in the biographical 2014 film The Theory of Everything, in which he was portrayed by Eddie Redmayne in an Academy Award-winning role.[401] Hawking was featured at the Monty Python Live (Mostly) show in 2014. He was shown to sing an extended version of the \"Galaxy Song\", after running down Brian Cox with his wheelchair, in a pre-recorded video.[402][403]/nHawking used his fame to advertise products, including a wheelchair,[295] National Savings,[404] British Telecom, Specsavers, Egg Banking,[405] and Go Compare.[406] In 2015, he applied to trademark his name.[407]/nBroadcast in March 2018 just a week or two before his death, Hawking was the voice of The Book Mark II on The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy radio series, and he was the guest of Neil deGrasse Tyson on StarTalk.[408]/nThe 2021- animated sitcom The Freak Brothers features a recurring character, Mayor Pimco, who is apparently modeled after Stephen Hawking.[409]/nOn 8 January 2022, Google featured Hawking in a Google Doodle on the occasion of his 80th birth anniversary.[410]/nHawking received numerous awards and honours. Already early in the list, in 1974 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS).[6] At that time, his nomination read:/nHawking has made major contributions to the field of general relativity. These derive from a deep understanding of what is relevant to physics and astronomy, and especially from a mastery of wholly new mathematical techniques. Following the pioneering work of Penrose he established, partly alone and partly in collaboration with Penrose, a series of successively stronger theorems establishing the fundamental result that all realistic cosmological models must possess singularities. Using similar techniques, Hawking has proved the basic theorems on the laws governing black holes: that stationary solutions of Einstein's equations with smooth event horizons must necessarily be axisymmetric; and that in the evolution and interaction of black holes, the total surface area of the event horizons must increase. In collaboration with G. Ellis, Hawking is the author of an impressive and original treatise on \"Space-time in the Large\"./nThe citation continues, \"Other important work by Hawking relates to the interpretation of cosmological observations and to the design of gravitational wave detectors.\"[411]/nHawking was also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1984),[412] the American Philosophical Society (1984),[413] and the United States National Academy of Sciences (1992).[414]/nHawking received the 2015 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Basic Sciences shared with Viatcheslav Mukhanov for discovering that the galaxies were formed from quantum fluctuations in the early Universe. At the 2016 Pride of Britain Awards, Hawking received the lifetime achievement award \"for his contribution to science and British culture\".[415] After receiving the award from Prime Minister Theresa May, Hawking humorously requested that she not seek his help with Brexit.[415]/nIn 2017, the Cambridge Union Society, in conjunction with Hawking, established the Professor Stephen Hawking Fellowship. The fellowship is awarded annually to an individual who has made an exceptional contribution to the STEM fields and social discourse,[416] with a particular focus on impacts affecting the younger generations. Each fellow delivers a lecture on a topic of their choosing, known as the \u2018Hawking Lecture\u2019.[417]/nHawking himself accepted the inaugural fellowship, and he delivered the first Hawking Lecture in his last public appearance before his passing. [418][419]/nHawking was a member of the advisory board of the Starmus Festival, and had a major role in acknowledging and promoting science communication. The Stephen Hawking Medal for Science Communication is an annual award initiated in 2016 to honour members of the arts community for contributions that help build awareness of science.[420] Recipients receive a medal bearing a portrait of Hawking by Alexei Leonov, and the other side represents an image of Leonov himself performing the first spacewalk along with an image of the \"Red Special\", the guitar of Queen musician and astrophysicist Brian May (with music being another major component of the Starmus Festival).[421]/nThe Starmus III Festival in 2016 was a tribute to Stephen Hawking and the book of all Starmus III lectures, \"Beyond the Horizon\", was also dedicated to him.

The Hippias minor discusses the deficiency of our knowledge, and characterizes Hippias as ridiculously vain.[1]/nHippias was a man of very extensive knowledge, and he occupied himself not only with rhetorical, philosophical, and political studies, but was also well versed in poetry, music, mathematics, painting and sculpture, and he claimed some practical skill in the ordinary arts of life, for he used to boast of wearing on his body nothing that he had not made himself with his own hands, such as his seal-ring, his cloak, and shoes.[4] He was credited with a lost work known as the Olympionik\u014d\u0302n Anagraph\u1e17 (\u1f48\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae) which computed Coroebus's victory as occurring in 776\u00a0BC and became the basis of all later lists of the Olympiads and their victors.[5] On the other hand, his knowledge always appears superficial, he does not enter into the details of any particular art or science, and is satisfied with certain generalities, which enabled him to speak on everything without a thorough knowledge of any. This arrogance, combined with ignorance, is the main cause which provoked Plato to his severe criticism of Hippias, as the sophist enjoyed a very extensive reputation, and thus had a large influence upon the education of the youths of the higher classes. Plutarch also criticized Hippias in The Life of Numa in Parallel Lives when writing about the chronology of Numa's relationship with Pythagoras, mentioning that the chronology was based on the Olympionik\u014d\u0302n Anagraph\u1e17 and stating that Hippias had no authoritative basis on his work.[6] A mathematical discovery ascribed to Hippias is sometimes called the quadratrix of Hippias./nHis great skill seems to have consisted in delivering grand show speeches; and Plato has him arrogantly declaring that he would travel to Olympia, and there deliver before the assembled Greeks an oration on any subject that might be proposed to him;[7] and Philostratus in fact speaks of several such orations delivered at Olympia, and which created great sensation. If such speeches were published by Hippias, then no specimen has come down to us. Plato claims he wrote epic poetry, tragedies, dithyrambs, and various orations,[8] as well as works on grammar, music, rhythm, harmony, and a variety of other subjects.[9] He seems to have been especially fond of choosing antiquarian and mythical subjects for his show speeches. Athenaeus mentions a work of Hippias under the title Synagoge which is otherwise unknown.[10] An epigram of his is preserved in Pausanias.[11]/nHippias is credited with originating the idea of natural law. This ideal began at first during the fifth century B.C. According to Hippias, natural law was never to be superseded as it was universal.[12] Hippias saw natural law as a habitual entity that humans take part in without pre-meditation. He regarded the elite in states as indistinguishable from one another and thus they should perceive each other as so. Because of this they should consider and treat each other as a society of a unanimous state. These ideas were passed on through Cynicism and Stoicism later being the foundation for turning Roman law in legislation.[13] Along with natural law, Hippias also wrote about self-sufficiency as a binding principle. He used this principle in his teachings as he gathered knowledge in numerous subjects so as to be never outwitted or have his reputation questioned.[14]", "2402379": "Richard Melvin Schoen (born October 23, 1950) is an American mathematician known for his work in differential geometry and geometric analysis.

He then received his PhD in 1977 from Stanford University.  After faculty positions at the Courant Institute, NYU, University of California, Berkeley, and University of California, San Diego, he was Professor at Stanford University from 1987\u20132014, as Bass Professor of Humanities and Sciences since 1992.[16] He is currently Distinguished Professor and Excellence in Teaching Chair at the University of California, Irvine.[17] His surname is pronounced \"Shane.\"/nSchoen received an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship in 1972 and a Sloan Research Fellowship in 1979.[1] Schoen is a 1983 MacArthur Fellow.[2] He has been invited to speak at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) three times, including twice as a Plenary Speaker.[18] In 1983 he was an Invited Speaker at the ICM in Warsaw, in 1986 he was a Plenary Speaker at the ICM in Berkeley, and in 2010 he was a Plenary Speaker at the ICM in Hyderabad. For his work on the Yamabe problem, Schoen was awarded the B\u00f4cher Memorial Prize in 1989.[4] He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1988 and to the National Academy of Sciences in 1991, became Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1995, and won a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1996.[3][5][6]  In 2012 he became a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[7] He received the 2014\u201315 Dean\u2019s Award for Lifetime Achievements in Teaching from Stanford University.[8] In 2015, he was elected Vice President of the American Mathematical Society.[19] He was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Science from the University of Warwick in 2015.[20] He received the Wolf Prize in Mathematics for 2017, shared with Charles Fefferman.[21] In the same year, he was awarded the Heinz Hopf Prize, the Lobachevsky Medal and Prize by Kazan Federal University, and the Rolf Schock Prize.[22][23][24]/nHe has had over 44 doctoral students, including Hubert Bray, Jos\u00e9 F. Escobar, Ailana Fraser, Chikako Mese, William Minicozzi, and Andr\u00e9 Neves.[25]/nSchoen has investigated the use of analytic techniques in global differential geometry, with a number of fundamental contributions to the regularity theory of minimal surfaces and harmonic maps./nIn 1976, Schoen and Shing-Tung Yau used Yau's earlier Liouville theorems to extend the rigidity phenomena found earlier by James Eells and Joseph Sampson to noncompact settings.[26][27] By identifying a certain interplay of the Bochner identity for harmonic maps together with the second variation of area formula for minimal hypersurfaces, they also identified some novel conditions on the domain leading to the same conclusion. These rigidity theorems are complemented by their existence theorem for harmonic maps on noncompact domains, as a simple corollary of Richard Hamilton's resolution of the Dirichlet boundary-value problem.[28] As a consequence they found some striking geometric results, such as that certain noncompact manifolds do not admit any complete metrics of nonnegative Ricci curvature./nIn two papers from the 1980s, Schoen and Karen Uhlenbeck made a foundational contribution to the regularity theory of energy-minimizing harmonic maps. The techniques they developed, making extensive use of monotonicity formulas, have been very influential in the field of geometric analysis and have been adapted to a number of other problems. Fundamental conclusions of theirs include compactness theorems for sets of harmonic maps and control over the size of corresponding singular sets. Leon Simon applied such results to obtain a clear picture of the small-scale geometry of energy-minimizing harmonic maps.[29]/nLater, Mikhael Gromov had the insight that an extension of the theory of harmonic maps, to allow values in metric spaces rather than Riemannian manifolds, would have a number of significant applications, with analogues of the classical Eells\u2212Sampson rigidity theorem giving novel rigidity theorems for lattices. The intense analytical details of such a theory were worked out by Schoen. Further foundations of this new context for harmonic maps were laid out by Schoen and Nicholas Korevaar./nIn 1979, Schoen and his former doctoral supervisor, Shing-Tung Yau, made a number of highly influential contributions to the study of positive scalar curvature. By an elementary but novel combination of the Gauss equation, the formula for second variation of area, and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, Schoen and Yau were able to rule out the existence of several types of stable minimal surfaces in three-dimensional manifolds of positive scalar curvature. By contrasting this result with an analytically deep theorem of theirs establishing the existence of such surfaces, they were able to achieve constraints on which manifolds can admit a metric of positive scalar curvature. Schoen and Doris Fischer-Colbrie later undertook a broader study of stable minimal surfaces in 3-dimensional manifolds, using instead an analysis of the stability operator and its spectral properties./nAn inductive argument based upon the existence of stable minimal hypersurfaces allowed them to extend their results to higher dimensions. Further analytic techniques facilitated the application of topological surgeries on manifolds which admit metrics of positive scalar curvature, showing that the class of such manifolds is topologically rich. Mikhael Gromov and H. Blaine Lawson obtained similar results by other methods, also undertaking a deeper analysis of topological consequences.[30][31]/nBy an extension of their techniques to noncompact manifolds, Schoen and Yau were able to settle the important Riemannian case of the positive mass theorem in general relativity, which can be viewed as a statement about the geometric behavior near infinity of noncompact manifolds with positive scalar curvature. Like their original results, the argument is based upon contradiction. A more constructive argument, using the theory of harmonic spinors instead of minimal hypersurfaces, was later found by Edward Witten.[32][33][34]/nSchoen, Yau, and Leon Simon identified a simple combination of the Simons formula with the formula for second variation of area which yields important curvature estimates for stable minimal hypersurfaces of low dimensions. In 1983, Schoen obtained similar estimates in the special case of two-dimensional surfaces, making use of the existence of isothermal coordinates. Slightly weaker estimates were obtained by Schoen and Simon, although without any dimensional restriction. Fundamental consequences of the Schoen\u2212Simon estimates include compactness theorems for stable minimal hypersurfaces as well as control over the size of \"singular sets.\"  In particular, the Schoen\u2212Simon estimates are an important tool in the Almgren\u2013Pitts min-max theory, which has found a number of applications./nThe possible presence of singular sets restricts the dimensions in which Schoen and Yau's inductive arguments can be easily carried out. Meanwhile Witten's essential use of spinors restricts his results to topologically special cases. Thus the general case of the positive mass theorem in higher dimensions was left as a major open problem in Schoen and Yau's 1979 work. In 1988, they settled the problem in arbitrary dimension in the special case that the Weyl tensor is zero; this has been significant in conformal geometry. In 2017, they released a preprint claiming the general case, in which they deal directly with the singular sets of minimal hypersurfaces./nIn 1960, Hidehiko Yamabe introduced the \"Yamabe functional\" on a conformal class of Riemannian metrics and demonstrated that a critical point would have constant scalar curvature.[35] He made partial progress towards proving that critical points must exist, which was taken further by Neil Trudinger and Thierry Aubin.[36][37] Aubin's work, in particular, settled the cases of high dimension or when there exists a point where the Weyl tensor is nonzero. In 1984, Schoen settled the cases left open by Aubin's work, the decisive point of which rescaled the metric by the Green's function of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. This allowed an application of Schoen and Yau's positive mass theorem to the resulting metric, giving important asymptotic information about the original metric. The works of Yamabe, Trudinger, Aubin, and Schoen together comprise the solution of the Yamabe problem, which asserts that there is a metric of constant scalar curvature in every conformal class./nIn 1989, Schoen was also able to adapt Karen Uhlenbeck's bubbling analysis, developed for other geometric-analytic problems, to the setting of constant scalar curvature.[38][39] The uniqueness of critical points of the Yamabe functional, and more generally the compactness of the set of all critical points, is a subtle question first investigated by Schoen in 1991. Fuller results were later obtained by Simon Brendle, Marcus Khuri, Fernando Cod\u00e1 Marques, and Schoen./nIn the 1980s, Richard Hamilton introduced the Ricci flow and proved a number of convergence results, most notably for two- and three-dimensional spaces.[40][41] Although he and others found partial results in high dimensions, progress was stymied by the difficulty of understanding the complicated Riemann curvature tensor.[42] Simon Brendle and Schoen were able to prove that the positivity of Mario Micallef and John Moore's \"isotropic curvature\" is preserved by the Ricci flow in any dimension, a fact independently proven by Huy Nguyen.[43][44] Brendle and Schoen were further able to relate their positivity condition to the positivity of sectional curvature and of curvature operator, which allowed them to exploit then-recent algebraic ideas of Christoph B\u00f6hm and Burkhard Wilking, thereby obtaining a new convergence theorem for Ricci flow.[45] A special case of their convergence theorem has the differentiable sphere theorem as a simple corollary, which had been a well-known conjecture in the study of positive sectional curvature for the past fifty years./nTextbooks", "64235599": "Wade Ellis (June 9, 1909\u00a0\u2013 November 20, 1989) was an American mathematician and educator. He taught at Fort Valley State University in Georgia and Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee and earned his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Michigan in 1944.

The same year, he was elected to the Board of Governors of the Mathematical Association of America./nEllis promoted mathematical education and was decorated for his efforts in 1966 by the government of Peru. He returned to the University of Michigan in 1967 as Associate Dean of the Graduate School and Professor of Mathematics until his retirement in 1977, when he was named professor emeritus. Afterwards, he served in various administrative positions including vice chancellor of academic affairs at University of Maryland Eastern Shore  and interim president of Marygrove College in Detroit./nWade Ellis' father, Whitfield Washington, was born on September 26, 1870, in Sumter County, Alabama. In the mid-1880s, a confrontation involving Whitfield and several white men resulted in two white men dying. He escaped a possible lynching by making his way south to Mobile, Alabama and finding work as a cook on an international trade ship where he traveled to the Caribbean and the west coast of Africa. He eventually returned to the United States and moved to Oklahoma, changing his name to Whit Ellis and opening a restaurant. Wade Ellis' mother, Maggie Ellis, was born on August 25, 1880, in Dallas, Texas. Her father, James Riley, was likely born into slavery in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1844 before joining the Union Army towards the end of the American Civil War and eventually becoming a Buffalo Soldier. As a child Maggie attended an integrated school for white and Indian children and from 1898 to 1899 she attended high school at the Colored Agriculture and Normal University at Langston, Oklahoma, now known as Langston University. She met Whit in 1899 and the two were married in 1900.[2]/nWade Ellis was born in Chandler, Oklahoma on June 9, 1909, one of ten children. As a child he worked at his family's restaurant, doing chores such as cleaning fish and shucking corn. He took up the trombone and played in a family band. Ellis excelled academically and attended Douglass School, graduating at 14.[2] He received his bachelor's degree from Wilberforce University, Ohio in 1929, at age 18, his master's degree from the University of New Mexico in 1938, and his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 1944.[3] After moving to Ann Arbor in 1939, he purchased a home in 1941 with the help of a $300 ($5514 in 2019 value) loan from his barber.[2]/nHe died of a heart attack on November 20, 1989, in San Jose, California.[4]/nEllis earned his master's degree from the University of New Mexico in 1938, though he was forced to march at the end of his graduation line because of his race.[2] When he was invited to speak and have dinner at the Texas Section of the American Mathematical Society, black people were not allowed to dine with the Section. Worried at offending their guest, mathematicians Paul K. Rees, who invited Ellis, and C.V. Newsom, who was then-chair at New Mexico, arranged the seating so that the two of them, along with another individual from New Mexico, would leave an empty seat for Ellis at dinner in hopes that the seating would not be noticed. It passed without incident, and Ellis inadvertently became the first black mathematician to have dinner with the Texas Section.[5][6]/nIn 1938, he presented The efficiency of approximation formulas for determining the rate of interest in amortization schedules to the Southwestern Section of the Mathematics Association of America (MAA).[5] He began teaching in a one-room schoolhouse in Oklahoma, and taught at the Boys Industrial School in Boley, Oklahoma, Fort Valley State College in Georgia, and at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee, all of which were segregated.[7] He received a Rosenwald Fellowship.[2][3]/nIn 1939, he moved with his wife Agatha and newborn son William Whit to Ann Arbor, Michigan to begin his doctorate at the University of Michigan. At the time only a few schools in the country accepted black students, and it was among the best-known. The school still had many segregation policies and issues with racism, but compared to others he believed it treated black students relatively well.[2] He encouraged his brother Francis (Frank) Willis to enroll in a summer program at the school, and Frank eventually became a research assistant and also enrolled at the school.[2] Under the supervision of George Yuri Rainich, he finished his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1944, and became the twelfth African-American to do so in the United States.[5] His thesis, On Relations Satisfied by Linear Operators on a Three Dimensional Linear Vector Space, was designated the \"best in his department\". Despite his excellent scholarly record, unlike other Ph.D. candidates he did not receive a teaching fellowship, and as a teaching assistant he was only paid 20% of what white teaching assistants earned.[2]/nFrom 1944 to 1948 he worked at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory as a Section Director, where he carried out classified research on radar antennas as well as detecting whether the Soviet Union had detonated atomic weapons.[2][7] He taught at Boston University[8] before becoming the first black faculty member at Oberlin College in 1948,[9][10] where he stayed for 19 years. While at Oberlin, he also became a member of the city council and served one term as the town's Vice-Mayor.[2] In 1953 he became a Full Professor,[2] and was elected to the Board of Governors of the Mathematical Association of America, and in 1954 he presented his paper On the directional derivative and was elected as an officer of the organization's Program Committee.[11]/nIn 1967 he became the Associate Dean of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies and Professor of Mathematics at the University of Michigan, where he contributed to the Michigan Scholars Program.

He was a proponent of intelligent design (ID) pseudoscience,[1] specifically the concept of specified complexity, and was a senior fellow of the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture (CSC).[2] On September 23, 2016, he officially retired from intelligent design, resigning all his \"formal associations with the ID community, including [his] Discovery Institute fellowship of 20 years\".[3] A February 2021 interview in the CSC's blog Evolution News announced \"his return to the intelligent design arena\".[4]/nIn 2012, he taught as the Phillip E. Johnson Research Professor of Science and Culture at the Southern Evangelical Seminary in Matthews, North Carolina near Charlotte.[5]/nDembski has written books about intelligent design, including The Design Inference (1998), Intelligent Design: The Bridge Between Science & Theology (1999), The Design Revolution (2004), The End of Christianity (2009), and Intelligent Design Uncensored (2010)./nIntelligent design is the argument that an intelligent cause is responsible for the complexity of life and that one can detect that cause empirically.[6] Dembski postulated that probability theory can be used to prove irreducible complexity (IC) and what he called \"specified complexity.\"[7] The scientific community sees intelligent design\u2014and Dembski's concept of specified complexity\u2014as a form of creationism attempting to portray itself as science.[8]/nDembski was born in Chicago, Illinois, the only child of Catholic parents, his mother an art dealer and his father a college professor and lecturer. His father held a D.Sc. in biology from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg and taught evolutionary biology; while growing up Dembski was neither particularly religious nor did he question the theory of evolution.[9][10] He attended an all-male Catholic preparatory school in Chicago. Dembski finished high school a year early, excelling in math and finishing a calculus course in one summer. After high school he attended the University of Chicago. There, Dembski experienced educational and personal difficulties, struggling with the advanced courses and finding the unfamiliar social milieu of college challenging. Dembski dropped out of school and worked at his mother's art business while reading works on creationism and the Bible. Finding the creationist works interesting in their challenge of evolution but their literal interpretations lacking, Dembski returned to school at the University of Illinois at Chicago, studying statistics.[10]/nIt was in 1988 at a conference on randomness that Dembski began to believe that there was purpose, order, and design in the universe by the intervention of God.[10] Remaining in academia, Dembski ultimately completed an undergraduate degree in psychology (1981, University of Illinois at Chicago) and master's degrees in statistics, mathematics, and philosophy (1983, University of Illinois at Chicago; 1985, University of Chicago; 1993, University of Illinois at Chicago, respectively), two PhDs, one in mathematics and one in philosophy (1988, University of Chicago; 1996, University of Illinois at Chicago, respectively), and a Master of Divinity in theology at the Princeton Theological Seminary (1996).[11]/nAt the Princeton Theological Seminary, Dembski met his future wife, Jana.[12] Dissatisfied with what he called the \"free-swinging academic style\" of the school, Dembski also was involved in a group known as the Charles Hodge Society. Based on the works of the 19th century thinker Charles Hodge, the group was devoted to strengthening the faith of students faced with what members believed to be the \"theological disarray\" of the times, and to providing an example of how to oppose \"false and destructive ideas.\" It published a journal (a recreation of the Princeton Theological Review (1903\u20131929)) and met with considerable opposition on the campus, facing two lawsuits, threats of violence, accusations of racism and sexism; being denied funding; and hearing that membership \"jeopardized their academic advancement.\"[13]/nDembski and Jana have one daughter and two sons. One of his sons has autism and Dembski has attributed some of his son's problems to vaccines.[14]/nDembski holds that his knowledge of statistics and his skepticism concerning evolutionary theory led him to believe that the extraordinary diversity of life was statistically unlikely to have been produced by natural selection.[10] His first significant contribution to intelligent design was his 1991 paper, \"Randomness by Design,\" published in the philosophy journal No\u00fbs.[15][16]/nFormer UC Berkeley law school professor Phillip E. Johnson's book Darwin on Trial (1991) attracted a group of scholars[17] who shared his view that the exclusion of supernatural explanations by the scientific method was unfair and had led to the Edwards v. Aguillard ruling that teaching creation science in public schools was unconstitutional. Dembski was part of that group at a symposium at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, in March 1992, before they came to call themselves \"The Wedge.\"[18]/nDembski  wrote a contribution to the 1994 book The Creation Hypothesis. Another chapter, contributed by the creationists Charles Thaxton and Walter L Bradley, discussed \"design detection\" and redefined \"specified complexity\" as a way of measuring information.[19]\nThese ideas led to Dembski's notion of specified complexity, which he developed in The Design Inference, a 1998 revision of his PhD dissertation in philosophy.[20]/nIn 1987, the phrase \"intelligent design\" replaced \"creation science\" in drafts of a book, Of Pandas and People, that was intended for secondary school students. The phrase referred to the idea that life was created through unspecified processes by an intelligent but unidentified designer. The book asserted that there was a logical need for such a designer because of the appearance of design in biological organisms. This replacement was intended to evade the Edwards v. Aguillard ruling. The book was published in 1989 amidst campaigning by the publisher for the introduction of \"intelligent design\" into school science classes./nBiochemist Michael Behe, another member of \"The Wedge,\" contributed the argument that he subsequently called \"irreducible complexity\" to a subsequent edition of Pandas in 1993. The book contained concepts which Dembski later elaborated in his treatment of \"specified complexity.\"[21]/nAfter completing graduate school in 1996, Dembski was unable to secure a university position; from then until 1999 he received what he calls \"a standard academic salary\" of $40,000 a year as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture. \"I was one of the early beneficiaries of Discovery largess,\" says Dembski.[22]/nUntil September 2016, Dembski served as a senior fellow at the CSC,[2] where he played a central role in the center's extensive public and political campaigns advancing the concept of intelligent design and its teaching in public schools through its \"Teach the Controversy\" campaign as part of the institute's wedge strategy. He has since resigned his fellowship position with the Discovery Institute./nIn 1999, Dembski was invited by Robert B. Sloan, President of Baylor University, to establish the Michael Polanyi Center at the university. Named after the Hungarian physical chemist and philosopher Michael Polanyi (1891\u20131976), Dembski described it as \"the first intelligent design think tank at a research university.\" Dembski had known Sloan for about three years, having taught Sloan's daughter at a Christian study summer camp not far from Waco, Texas. Sloan was the first Baptist minister to serve as Baylor's president in over 30 years, had read some of Dembski's work and liked it; according to Dembski, Sloan \"made it clear that he wanted to get me on the faculty in some way.\"[23]  The salaries were supported by a grant from the John Templeton Foundation.[24]/nThe Polanyi Center was established without much publicity in October 1999, initially consisting of two people \u2013 Dembski and a like-minded colleague, Bruce L. Gordon, who were hired directly by Sloan without going through the usual channels of a search committee and departmental consultation. The vast majority of Baylor staff did not know of the center's existence until its website went online, and the center stood outside of the existing religion, science, and philosophy departments./nThe center's mission, and the lack of consultation with the Baylor faculty, became the immediate subject of controversy. The faculty feared for the university's reputation \u2013 it has historically been well regarded for its contributions to mainstream science \u2013 and scientists outside the university questioned whether Baylor had \"gone fundamentalist.\"[23] Faculty members pointed out that the university's existing interdisciplinary Institute for Faith and Learning was already addressing questions about the relationship between science and religion, making the existence of the Polanyi Center somewhat redundant. In April 2000, Dembski hosted a conference on \"naturalism in science\" sponsored by the John Templeton Foundation and the hub of the intelligent design movement, the Discovery Institute, seeking to address the question \"Is there anything beyond nature?\" Most of the Baylor faculty boycotted the conference./nA few days later, the Baylor faculty senate voted by a margin of 27\u20132 to ask the administration to dissolve the center and merge it with the Institute for Faith and Learning. President Sloan refused, citing issues of censorship and academic integrity, but agreed to convene an outside committee to review the center. The committee recommended setting up a faculty advisory panel to oversee the science and religion components of the program, dropping the name \"Michael Polanyi\" and reconstituting the center as part of the Institute for Faith and Learning.[25] These recommendations were accepted in full by the university administration./nIn a subsequent press release, Dembski asserted that the committee had given an \"unqualified affirmation of my own work on intelligent design,\" that its report \"marks the triumph of intelligent design as a legitimate form of academic inquiry\" and that \"dogmatic opponents of design who demanded the Center be shut down have met their Waterloo. Baylor University is to be commended for remaining strong in the face of intolerant assaults on freedom of thought and expression.\"[26][27]/nDembski's remarks were criticized by other members of the Baylor faculty, who protested that they were both an unjustified attack on his critics at Baylor and a false assertion that the university endorsed Dembski's controversial views on intelligent design. Charles Weaver, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Baylor and one of the most vocal critics of the Polanyi Center, commented: \"In academic arguments, we don't seek utter destruction and defeat of our opponents. We don't talk about Waterloos.\"[10]/nPresident Sloan asked Dembski to withdraw his press release, but Dembski refused, accusing the university of \"intellectual McCarthyism\" (borrowing a phrase that Sloan himself had used when they first tried to dissolve the center). He declared that the university's action had been taken \"in the utmost of bad faith ... thereby providing the fig leaf of justification for my removal.\"[28] Professor Michael Beaty, director of the Institute for Faith and Learning, said that Dembski's remarks violated the spirit of cooperation that the committee had advocated and stated that \"Dr. Dembski's actions after the release of the report compromised his ability to serve as director.\"[29] Dembski was removed as the center's director, although he remained an associate research professor until May 2005. He was not asked to teach any courses in that time and instead worked from home, writing books and speaking around the country. \"In a sense, Baylor did me a favor,\" he said. \"I had a five-year sabbatical.\"[30]/nFrom 1999 to 2005, he was on the faculty of Baylor University, where he was a focus of attention and controversy. During the academic year 2005\u20132006, he was briefly the Carl F. H. Henry Professor of Theology and Science at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, as well as the first director of the school's new Center for Theology and Science (since replaced by prominent creationist Kurt Wise).[31] The seminary teaches creationism but its professors vary on the details, with most adhering to the young Earth creationist viewpoint of a relatively recent creation which occurred literally as described in Genesis; Dembski does not hold to young Earth creationism (YEC). On his position at Southern, Dembski also remarked that \"Theology is where my ultimate passion is and I think that is where I can uniquely contribute.\"[32] He left Southern in May 2006.[33] Starting in June 2006 he became a professor in philosophy at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (SWBTS) in Fort Worth, Texas. Since taking up a position within Southwestern's School of Theology in June 2006, Dembski has taught a number of courses within its Department of Philosophy of Religion.[33][34] For some of his courses, he requires that his students promote intelligent design on \"hostile\" websites for course credit.[34] The Southern Baptist Convention operates both seminaries./nIn September 2007, the SWBTS hosted a conference, \"Intelligent Design in Business Practice,\" presented by Dembski, Acton Institute theologian Jay Richards, and three business academics presently or formerly teaching at universities in the Southern United States.[35]/nOn April 2, 2006, Dembski stated on his blog that he reported Eric Pianka to the Department of Homeland Security because he and fellow Discovery Institute Fellow Forrest Mims felt that Pianka's speech while accepting the Texas Academy of Science's Distinguished Texas Scientist Award in 2006 fomented bioterrorism.[36] This resulted in the Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewing Pianka in Austin.[37] On April 5, Dembski wagered that Pianka's popularity would drop if the full text of his speech to the Texas Academy of Science were made public.[38]/nSubsequently, in July and August 2007, Dembski played a central role in the formation of the Evolutionary Informatics Lab (EIL), cofounded with Baylor University Engineering Professor Robert J. Marks II.[39] According to Baylor administration, the EIL website hosted at Baylor was deleted because it violated university policy forbidding professors from creating the impression that their personal views represent Baylor as an institution. Dembski says the website was removed because it dealt with intelligent design.[40] Baylor said they would permit Marks to repost his website on their server, provided a 108-word disclaimer[41] accompany any intelligent design-advancing research to make clear that the work does not represent the university's position.[42][43][44] The site now resides on a third-party server and still contains the material advancing intelligent design.[45] Dembski's participation was funded by a $30,000 grant from the Lifeworks Foundation, which is controlled by researcher Brendan Dixon of the Biologic Institute (which has close ties to the Discovery Institute).[46]/nWhile serving as a professor at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Dembski wrote The End of Christianity, which argued that a Christian can reconcile an old Earth creationist view with a literal reading of Adam and Eve in the Bible by accepting the scientific consensus of a 4.5 billion year of Earth.[47] He further argued that Noah's flood likely was a phenomenon limited to the Middle East.[48] This caused controversy and Dembski's reading of the Bible was criticized by Tom Nettles, a young Earth creationist, in The Southern Baptist Journal of Theology, Southern Seminary's official theological journal.[48][49] In 2010, the dean of Southwestern's School of Theology, David Allen, \"released a White Paper through the seminary's Center for Theological Research defending Dembski as within the bounds of orthodoxy and critiquing Nettles for misunderstanding the book. The paper included Dembski's statement admitting error regarding Noah's flood.\"[48][50] Southwestern Seminary president Paige Patterson, a young Earth creationist, \"said that when Dembski's questionable statements came to light, he convened a meeting with Dembski and several high-ranking administrators at the seminary. At that meeting, Dembski was quick to admit that he was wrong about the flood. \"'Had I had any inkling that Dr. Dembski was actually denying the absolute trustworthiness of the Bible, then that would have, of course, ended his relationship with the school,' he said.\"[48]/nIn December 2001, Dembski launched the International Society for Complexity, Information and Design (ISCID), of which he is Executive Director. Dembski is also the editor-in-chief of ISCID's journal, Progress in Complexity, Information, and Design (PCID), which appears to have ceased publication with its November 2005 issue.[51] He has several more books in preparation as well as producing an Adobe Flash animation mocking Judge John E. Jones III, who presided in the landmark 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District case.[52] He is also a member of American Scientific Affiliation, the Evangelical Philosophical Society, and the American Mathematical Society, and is a senior fellow of the Wilberforce Forum./nDembski frequently gives public talks, principally to religious, pro-ID groups, and creationists. Barbara Forrest and Paul R. Gross noted that Dembski has not been hesitant in associating with young Earth creationists, such as attending conferences with Carl Baugh.[53] His lectures have been met with criticism: a presentation he made to the University of Oklahoma was funded by Trinity Baptist Church in Norman, Oklahoma, as a \"gospel investment\" but university faculty instructors criticised Dembski's presentation as half-hearted, lackluster, containing numerous errors and distortions, lacking positive evidence for intelligent design, and for evading questions.[54]/nDembski, along with fellow Discovery Institute associates Michael Behe and David Berlinski, tutored Ann Coulter on science and evolution for her book Godless: The Church of Liberalism (2006).[55] Approximately one-third of the book is devoted to polemical attacks on evolution, which Coulter, as Dembski often does, terms \"Darwinism.\"[56]/nDembski participated in the documentary film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed, released in 2008. Dembski told the Southern Baptist Texan that those who need to see the movie are the \"parents of children in high school or college, as well as those children themselves, who may think that the biological sciences are a dispassionate search for truth about life but many of whose practitioners see biology, especially evolutionary biology, as an ideological weapon to destroy faith in God.\"[57] Dembski has appeared on several television shows, including a 2005 interview with Jon Stewart on The Daily Show with Edward Larson and Ellie Crystal where he said he accepted religion before science.[58]/nIn 1998, Dembski published his first book, The Design Inference: Eliminating Chance through Small Probabilities, which became a Cambridge University Press bestselling philosophical monograph./nIn 2002, Dembski published his book No Free Lunch: Why Specified Complexity Cannot Be Purchased without Intelligence. Dembski's work was strongly criticized within the scientific community, which argued that there were a number of major logical inconsistencies and evidential gaps in Dembski's hypothesis. David Wolpert, co-creator of the No free lunch theorem on which Dembski based his book, characterized his arguments as \"fatally informal and imprecise,\" \"written in jello,\" reminiscent of philosophical discussion \"of art, music, and literature, as well as much of ethics\" rather than of scientific debate.[59]/nMathematician Mark Perakh has stated he believes Dembski overemphasizes his own self-importance in his writing.[60]/nOne of the common objections to intelligent design being accepted as valid science is that ID proponents have published no scientific papers in the peer-reviewed scientific literature in support of their conjectures. The ruling in the 2005 Dover trial, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, found that intelligent design had not been tested by the process of being published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal and was not supported by any peer-reviewed research, data or publications.[61][62] Despite the Dover trial ruling, the Discovery Institute lists Dembski's 1998 book The Design Inference under the heading \"Peer-Reviewed Scientific Books Supportive of Intelligent Design Published by Trade Presses or University Presses.\"[63] The Discovery Institute describes Dembski as a mathematician and philosopher, who includes in his credentials a B.A. in psychology and postdoctoral work in mathematics, physics and computer science.[2][64]/nIn an expert report, computer scientist and number theorist Jeffrey Shallit states that despite common claims in the popular and religious press, Dembski is not a scientist by any reasonable standard, has not published any experimental or empirical tests of his claims, submitted his claims to the scrutiny of his peers or been published in a scientific journal. In a footnote, Shallit states that he does not consider mathematics to be science. Shallit describes Dembski's published mathematical output as \"extremely small\" for a research mathematician and remarks that \"it is very unlikely that his meagre output would merit tenure at any major university.\"[65]/nSince Shallit's statement, Dembski has (as of May 2010) published four peer-reviewed papers in information theory venues associated with the IEEE professional society. The papers deal with active information in the context of searches for solutions to problems. Quantified active information is introduced in \"Conservation of Information in Search: Measuring the Cost of Success.\"[66] A second paper, \"Evolutionary Synthesis of Nand Logic: Dissecting a Digital Organism,\"[67] claims to deconstruct the evolution simulation Avida by uncovering the sources of active information in the program. A third paper[68] discusses the role of Jacob Bernoulli's principle of indifference in the analysis of evolution. The most recent paper, \"Efficient Per Query Information Extraction from a Hamming Oracle,\"[69] calculates the performance of various search algorithms which use the Hamming distance to search for a single string of a certain length in the set of all strings of this length./nDembski states that his book The Design Inference has also been peer-reviewed: \"This book was published by Cambridge University Press and peer-reviewed as part of a distinguished monograph series, Cambridge Studies in Probability, Induction, and Decision Theory.\"[70] In his expert report, Shallit states, \"I know that book manuscripts typically do not receive the same sort of scrutiny that research articles do. ...it is not uncommon for a 10-page paper to receive 5 pages or more of comments, whereas a book manuscript of two hundred pages often receives about the same number....\"[65] In addition, Mark Isaak claims that Dembski's book was reviewed by philosophers and not biologists.[71]/nIn November 2007, a graduate student named S. A. Smith brought an apparent case of wholesale academic misuse of unlicensed content to public attention. She noticed that a video used by Dembski in his lecture was identical to The Inner Life of the Cell animation created by Harvard University and XVIVO Scientific Animation. The audio track giving a scientific explanation was stripped off and the video was used with an alternative narration. The matter was brought to the attention of Harvard and XVIVO. David Bolinsky, creator of the video, wrote that Dembski was warned about using the video without permission.[72]/nIn response to the allegations, Dembski has claimed that he downloaded the video from the Internet, and added a voiceover narration that he deemed appropriate for his audience. According to Dembski, the downloaded version omitted the opening credits but contained the closing credits, which were shown to the audience.[73] However, Smith later documented several instances where images from the Harvard/XVIVO animation were apparently removed from his book The Design of Life (2008) but the related footnotes and references were not.[74][75] indicating that Dembski was already aware that permission had been denied for him to use the animation when he delivered his presentation at the University of Oklahoma.[75]/nOn April 9, 2008, Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed, a movie Dembski appears in, was given a cease-and-desist by XVIVO accusing Premise Media, the Expelled producers, of plagiarism concerning the same video.[76] A June 2008 Premise Media press release announced Premise Media and XVIVO, LLC, \"reached an agreement\" noting \"XVIVO has agreed that the Premise Media documentary does not infringe on any of XVIVO's intellectual property rights.\"[77]/nDembski's views on evolution have been a source of considerable controversy within both the mainstream scientific and creationist communities. Dembski does not accept universal common descent.[78] His mainstream scientific critics have accused him of dishonesty in his representation of scientific facts and writing,[79][80] and he has also been criticised by the traditional creationist community for not supporting the young Earth creationist position,[81] though this community does defend some of his other arguments.[82][83][84]/nDembski objects to the presence of the theory of evolution in a variety of disciplines, presenting intelligent design as an alternative to reductionist materialism that gives a sense of purpose that the unguided evolutionary process lacks[85] and the ultimate significance of ID is its success in undermining materialism and naturalism.[32] Dembski has also stated that ID has little chance as a serious scientific theory as long as methodological naturalism is the basis for science.[86] Although intelligent design proponents (including Dembski) have made little apparent effort to publish peer-reviewed scientific research to support their hypotheses, in recent years they have made vigorous efforts to promote the teaching of intelligent design in schools.[87] Dembski is a strong supporter of this drive as a means of making young people more receptive to intelligent design, and said he wants \"to see intelligent design flourish as a scientific research program\" among a \"new generation of scholars\" willing to consider the theory and textbooks that include it.[88]/nDembski's theories do not attempt to explain the origin of the intelligent designer that created the universe, which he argues is unnecessary, since such an intelligent designer is likely outside the dimensions of space and time which are the subject of empirical science./nHe has not had any of his pro-intelligent-design articles published in peer-reviewed mainstream scientific journals. While intelligent design proponents often allege that such failure to be published is due to a pro-evolution bias or conspiracy, Dembski himself has said he prefers to disseminate his ideas in non-peer-reviewed media: \"I've just gotten kind of blas\u00e9 about submitting things to journals where you often wait two years to get things into print. And I find I can actually get the turnaround faster by writing a book and getting the ideas expressed there. My books sell well. I get a royalty. And the material gets read more.\"[89]/nIn December 2007, Dembski told Focus on the Family that \"The Designer of intelligent\ndesign is, ultimately, the Christian God.\"[90]/nSpecified complexity is an concept which Dembski has proposed and used in his works promoting intelligent design, an argument intended to give a formal definition of patterns that are both specified and complex. He claims it is a reliable marker of design by an intelligent agent, a central concept of intelligent design, as opposed to natural selection in modern evolutionary theory. The concept of specified complexity is widely regarded as mathematically unsound and has not been the basis for further independent work in information theory, complexity theory, or biology.[91][92][93] Specified complexity is one of the two main arguments used by intelligent design proponents, the other being irreducible complexity./nDembski's position on intelligent design's relationship with Christianity has been inconsistent. He has suggested that the \"intelligent designer\" is not necessarily synonymous with a god: \"It could be space aliens. There are many possibilities,\"[94] but has on several occasions been explicit in labelling the designer as the Christian god and linking ID with a religious revival through which Christianity can be restored to its formerly pre-eminent place in society, supplanting \"materialist\" science. In his book Intelligent Design: The Bridge Between Science & Theology he states \"The conceptual soundings of the [intelligent design] theory can in the end only be located in Christ.\"[95] On his website, DesignInference.com, Dembski said that intelligent design provides an intellectual basis to restore Christian philosophy over materialism.[96]/nDembski has also spoken of his motivation for supporting intelligent design in a series of Sunday lectures in the Fellowship Baptist Church in Waco, Texas, the last of which took place on March 7, 2004. Answering a question, Dembski said it was to enable God to receive credit for creation.[97]/nDembski sees intelligent design as being a popular movement as well as a scientific hypothesis and claims that it is in the process of dislodging evolution from the public imagination. At the CSICOP's 4th World Skeptics Conference, held on June 20\u201323, 2002, in Burbank, California, he told the audience that \"over the next twenty-five years ID will provide the greatest challenge to skepticism.\" He asserted that \"ID is threatening to be mainstream,\" and that polls show 90 percent support for the hypothesis, indicating that it has \"already becom[e] mainstream within the public themselves.\" \"The usual skeptical retorts are not going to work against ID\" and ID \"turns the tables on skepticism.\" Evolution, in his view, \"is the ultimate status quo\" and \"squelches dissent.\" Young people, who \"love rebellion\" see that and are attracted to ID as a result. \"The public supports intelligent design. The public is tired of being bullied by an intellectual elite.\" He contends that skeptics resort to rhetoric and \"artificially define ID out of science,\" admitting only materialistic explanations as legitimate. ID \"paints the more appealing world picture,\" whereas skepticism works by being negative, which \"doesn't set well with the public... To most people evolution doesn't provide a compelling view.\"[98]/nDembski has also indicated an interest in the Bible code. In a favorable book review of Jeffrey Satinover's Cracking the Bible Code (1997), Dembski wrote that \"The philosopher Bertrand Russell was once asked why he didn't believe in God. He replied, 'Not enough evidence.' Satinover's fascination with the Bible Code is that it may provide evidence for God's existence that would have convinced even a Bertrand Russell.\"[99]/nDembski once took his family to a meeting conducted by Todd Bentley, a faith healer, in hopes of receiving a \"miraculous healing\" for his son, who is autistic.[100][101] In an article for the Baptist Press he recalled disappointment with the nature of the meeting and with the prevention of his son and other attendees from joining those in wheelchairs who were selected to receive prayer. He then concluded, \"Minimal time was given to healing, though plenty was devoted to assaulting our senses with blaring insipid music and even to Bentley promoting and selling his own products (books and CDs).\" He wrote that he did not regret the trip and called it an \"education,\" which showed \"how easily religion can be abused, in this case to exploit our family.\"[101]/nDembski previews material on the Internet for open peer review. This helps identify errors and address objections prior to publication, allowing him to get \"the last word in the exchange.\"[102] Dembski's style in response to his critics (particularly of his mathematical papers) is polemical.[13] For instance, in reply to a critique of the \"law of conservation of information\" posted on talkreason.org,[103] Dembski states: \"I'm not and never have been in the business of offering a strict mathematical proof for the inability of material mechanisms to generate specified complexity in the same way that no physicist is in the business of offering a strict mathematical proof for the conservation of energy.\"[104]/nSole author/nCo-author/nAs editor or contributor/nStewart, Robert B., ed.

When the tide was out I spent hours on the sands, looking at the star-fish and sea-urchins, or watching the children digging for sand-eels, cockles, and the spouting razor-fish. I made collections of shells, such as were cast ashore, some so small that they appeared like white specks in patches of black sand. There was a small pier on the sands for shipping limestone brought from the coal mines inland. I was astonished to see the surface of these blocks of stone covered with beautiful impressions of what seemed to be leaves; how they got there I could not imagine, but I picked up the broken bits, and even large pieces, and brought them to my repository.[14]/nDuring bad weather Somerville occupied herself with reading the books in her father's library, including Shakespeare, as well as with \"domestic duties.\" Such duties \"occupied a great part of my time; besides, I had to shew my sampler, working the alphabet from A to Z, as well as the ten numbers, on canvas\".[15] Her aunt Janet came to live with the family and reportedly said to her mother \"I wonder you let Mary waste her time in reading, she never shews [sews] more than if she were a man.\" Somerville was then sent to the village school to learn plain needlework, where she found herself annoyed that her \"turn for reading was so much disapproved of, and thought it unjust that women should have been given a desire for knowledge if it were wrong to acquire it.\" Several times each week the village school master came to teach Mary at home. In her Personal Recollections Somerville notes that the boys learned Latin at the village school, while \"it was thought sufficient for the girls to be able to read the Bible; very few even learnt writing.\"[16]/nAt age 13 her mother sent her to writing school in Edinburgh, where she improved her writing skills and studied arithmetic.[17] Back in Burntisland she taught herself sufficient Latin to read the books in the home library.[18] While visiting her aunt in Jedburgh she met her uncle Dr. Thomas Somerville. She gathered her courage to tell him that she had been learning Latin. Dr. Somerville assured her that in earlier times many women had become elegant scholars. He then proceeded to enable her to improve her Latin by reading Virgil with her.[19][8] While staying with another uncle, William Charters, in Edinburgh, Somerville was sent to a dancing school, where she learned manners and how to curtsey.[20] She also accompanied her uncle and aunt on their visits to the Lyell family in Kinnordy; Charles Lyell later became a celebrated geologist and Somerville's friend.[21]/nSomerville's father was a Tory, but she was a Liberal, made so by the \"unjust and exaggerated abuse of the Liberal party. From my earliest years my mind revolved against oppression and tyranny, and I resented the injustice of the world in denying all those privileges of education to my sex which were so lavishly bestowed on men.\"[22] At the time, slaves still worked to harvest sugar in the West Indies and in protest Somerville and her oldest brother Sam would refuse to take sugar in their tea.[23][22]/nAt Burntisland, where she stayed the summer with her uncle and aunt, Somerville had access to elementary books on algebra and geometry. She spent the summer learning to play the piano. In addition to the piano she learned Greek so she could read Xenophon and Herodotus in their original versions.[24] On her return to Edinburgh she was allowed to attend the academy of painter Alexander Nasmyth, which had opened for ladies. When Nasmyth advised another student to study Euclid's Elements to gain a foundation in perspective, astronomy and mechanical science, Somerville spotted an opportunity. She thought the book would help her understand Navigations by John Robertson.[25][8]/nShe continued in the traditional role of a daughter in a well-connected family, attending social events and maintaining a sweet and polite manner, which led to her nickname as \"the Rose of Jedburgh\" among Edinburgh socialites.[26] Meanwhile, a young tutor came to stay with the family in Burntisland to educate her younger brother Henry. The tutor, Mr. Craw, was a Greek and Latin scholar, and Somerville asked him to purchase elementary books on algebra and geometry for her. He presented Somerville with Euclid's Elements and Algebra by John Bonnycastle.[27] Somerville would rise early to play the piano, painted during the day, and stayed up late to study Euclid and algebra.[28] When Lord Balmuto, a family friend, invited her to visit his family Somerville saw her first laboratory.[29] She also spent some time with the Oswalds family in Dunnikeir, whose daughter, a bold horsewoman who impressed Somerville, became a Greek and Latin scholar and married Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin.[30]/nWinters were usually spent in Edinburgh. In the winter of 1796  Somerville made her first appearance at a ball under the care of Lady Burchan. Her first dancing partner was the Earl of Minto.[31]/nIn the autumn of 1797 her father was caught up in a mutiny while serving as flag-captain under Admiral Duncan on HMS\u00a0Venerable. Despite the mutiny the Battle of Camperdown was won by the British.[32] Her father was knighted and made Colonel of Marines.[33] Her eldest brother died at the age of 21 in Calcutta while serving in the East India Company's military service. The family had hoped he would make a sufficient fortune in a few years to enable him to return home.[34]/nIn 1804 Somerville met her first husband, Lieutenant Samuel Greig. Her distant cousin, and a son of Admiral Samuel Greig,[10] he was commissioner of the Russian navy and Russian consul for Britain.[35] They married and had two children, one of whom, Woronzow Greig, would become a barrister and scientist.[36] They lived in London, but it was not a happy time for Somerville. Her husband did not think much of women's intellectual capacity. Indeed, Greig \"possessed in full the prejudice against learned women which was common at that time.\"[37] Instead, Somerville took lessons in French, which was considered more appropriate.[38] When her husband died in 1807 she was still nursing their youngest child[39] and she returned to Scotland.[26]/nHer inheritance from Greig gave her the freedom to pursue intellectual interests. By that time she had studied plane and spherical trigonometry, conic sections and James Ferguson's Astronomy. Somerville also read Isaac Newton's Principia.[40] John Playfair, professor of natural philosophy at University of Edinburgh, encouraged her studies and through him she began a correspondence with William Wallace, with whom she discussed mathematical problems.[41]/nSomerville began solving mathematical problems posed in the mathematical journal of the Military College at Marlow and eventually made a name for herself after solving a diophantine problem, for which she was awarded a silver medal in 1811.[42][43] Somerville published five solutions in Volumes 3 and 4 of the Mathematical Repository under the pseudonym 'A Lady'. Two of her solutions demonstrated her early adoption of differential calculus\u2014her contribution to the circulation and visibility of calculus in early 19th-century Britain.[44]/nWallace suggested that she study the writings of French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace, which summarised the theory of gravity and collected the mathematical results established in the 50 years since Principia had been published. Somerville said that studying Laplace's work gave her the confidence to persevere in her mathematical studies.[45] She extended her studies to astronomy, chemistry, geography, microscopy, electricity and magnetism.[42] At the age of 33 she bought herself a library of scientific books. These included Louis-Benjamin Franc\u0153ur's Elements of Mechanics, Sylvestre Fran\u00e7ois Lacroix' Algebra and Calculus Treatise, Jean-Baptiste Biot's Analytical Geometry and Astronomy, Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson's Treatise on Mechanics, Joseph-Louis Lagrange's Theory of Analytical Functions, Leonhard Euler's Elements of Algebra and Isoperimetrical Problems, Alexis Clairaut's Figure of the Earth, Gaspard Monge's Application of Analysis to Geometry, and Fran\u00e7ois Callet's Logarithmus.[43]/nIn her Personal Recollections Somerville expressed the opinion that mathematical science was at a low ebb in Britain, due to a reverence for Newton that prevented scientists from adopting the calculus. On the Continent astronomical and mechanical science had reached a high degree of perfection. In her opinion this deadlock was not broken until 1816, when Charles Babbage, John Herschel and George Peacock published a translation of the  lectures of Sylvestre Lacroix, then a state-of-the-art calculus textbook.[40][46]/nWhile staying with her family in Scotland, Somerville became acquainted with several leading intellectual lights, such as Henry Brougham.[47] In 1812 she married another cousin, Dr William Somerville (1771\u20131860), inspector of the Army Medical Board, with whom she had four children. He encouraged and aided her in the study of the physical sciences.[48] In 1817 her husband was elected to the Royal Society and together they moved in the leading social circles of the day. Somerville was well known to scientists, as well as to leading writers and artists. Painter J. M. W. Turner[49] knew Somerville and her husband's family were neighbors of the writer Walter Scott. She wrote, \"I shall never forget the charm of this little society, especially the supper-parties at Abbotsford, when Scott was in the highest glee, telling amusing tales, ancient legends, ghost and witch stories.\"[50]/nIn 1819 Somerville's husband was appointed physician to Chelsea Hospital and the family moved into a government house at Hanover Square, Chelsea.[51] Somerville was a friend of Anne Isabella Milbanke, Baroness Wentworth, and was mathematics tutor to her daughter, Ada Lovelace. With Somerville, Lovelace attended scientific gatherings where she met Charles Babbage. Somerville College owns a letter from Babbage to Somerville inviting her to view his 'Calculating Engine'.[52] Somerville frequently visited Babbage while he was \"making his Calculating-machines\".[53] Somerville and Lovelace maintained a close friendship and when Lovelace encountered difficulties with a mathematical calculation she would walk to Somerville's house and discuss the matter over a cup of tea.[51]/nIn 1823 the Somervilles' youngest daughter died after an illness.[54]/nWhile living in Chelsea the Somervilles travelled through Europe on a number of occasions, leaving their children with their German governess. Among their travel companions was the jurist and politician Sir James Mackintosh. Before leaving London the Somervilles contacted the people they wanted to meet, which included numerous celebrated intellectuals.[55] The Somervilles also received frequent visitors; writer Maria Edgeworth would visit them when in England.[56]/nSomerville conducted experiments to explore the relationship between light and magnetism. Her first paper, \"The magnetic properties of the violet rays of the solar spectrum\", was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society in 1826. Although her conclusions were faulty,[57] the topic was of popular interest at the time and the paper brought her to notice in scientific circles.[58][42] Using a sample of silver nitrate supplied by  Michael Faraday, Somerville conducted experiments on the blackening effect of sunlight, the reaction used in early experiments in photography. She later developed her technique by using an optical prism and vegetable dyes, producing an early version of the optical spectrometer.[59] Sir David Brewster, inventor of the kaleidoscope, wrote in 1829 that Mary Somerville was \"certainly the most extraordinary woman in Europe \u2013 a mathematician of the very first rank with all the gentleness of a woman\".[41]/nLord Brougham asked Somerville to translate the M\u00e9canique C\u00e9leste of Pierre-Simon Laplace for the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. Laplace had, in five exhaustive volumes, summed up the current state of gravitational mathematics. M\u00e9canique C\u00e9leste was acclaimed as the greatest intellectual achievement since the Principia. Somerville produced not just a translation, but also an expanded version of the first two volumes. She wrote a standalone exposition of the mathematics behind the workings of the Solar System,[60] of which she said \"I translated Laplace's work from algebra into common language\". It was published in 1831, under the title of The Mechanism of the Heavens, and it immediately made her famous. Until the 1880s Mechanism was set as a textbook for undergraduates at University of Cambridge.[49]/nAfter receiving a copy of Mechanism Joanna Baillie wrote to Somerville, \"I feel myself greatly honoured by receiving such a mark of regard from one who has done more to remove the light estimation in which the capacity of women is too often held than all that has been accomplished by the whole Sisterhood of Poetical Damsels & novel-writing Authors.\"[61] The book was praised by George Peacock, Professor of the University of Cambridge, thus many of the 750 copies printed were bought in Cambridge. Reviews were favourable and Somerville received letters of congratulation from \"many men of science\".[62] She was elected honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy, the Bristol Philosophical Institution, and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Physique et d'Histoire Naturelle de Gen\u00e8ve in 1834.[63] The British Crown granted her a civil pension of \u00a3200 a year in recognition of her eminence in science and literature.[64]/nSomerville was passionate about astronomy and believed it to be the most extensive example of the connection of the physical sciences in that it combined the sciences of number and quantity, of rest and motion./nIn [astronomy] we perceive the operation of a force which is mixed up with everything that exists in the heavens or on earth; which pervades every atom, rules the motions of animate and inanimate beings, and is as sensible in the descent of a rain-drop as in the falls of Niagara; in the weight of the air, as in the periods of the moon.[65]/nIn Somerville's time the value of scientific publications depended on the currency of the information, therefore frequent editions had to be produced. Her subsequent books reflect the time she could free in her domestic life as her children became more independent. They also reflect the need to earn money, as the Somervilles suffered through a number of financial crises that peaked in 1835. She publicly and plausibly maintained that she wrote only for pleasure. Privately she paid considerable attention to the profitability of her books.[66] Through personal connections she could secure John Murray as the publisher of her first book, Mechanism, and he remained her publisher throughout her long career.[67] Murray later commented that despite having made little profit he was very pleased to have had the honour of publishing the works of such an extraordinary person.[68] Her second book, On the Connexion of the Physical Sciences, sold 15,000 copies and established her reputation in elite science.[69]/nShe was among those who discussed a hypothetical planet perturbing Uranus. In the 6th edition of Connexion (1842) she wrote, \"If after the lapse of years the tables formed from a combination of numerous observations should be still inadequate to represent the motions of Uranus, the discrepancies may reveal the existence, nay, even the mass and orbit of a body placed for ever beyond the sphere of vision\".[70] Predictions were fulfilled in 1846 with the discovery of Neptune revolving at a distance of 3,000,000,000 miles from the Sun. \"The mass of Neptune, the size and position of his orbit in space, and his periodic time, were determined from his disturbing action on Uranus before the planet itself had been seen.\"[70] Connexion ran to 10 editions, more than 9,000 copies and was its publisher's most successful science book until The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin.[49] It was translated into German and Italian and went through various editions in the United States.[71]/nHer book Physical Geography was published in 1848 and was the first English textbook on the subject. It remained in use until the early 20th century.[41] Physical Geography was financially successful and brought her the Victoria Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society.[73] Somerville followed, as she said, \"the noble example of Baron Humboldt, the patriarch of physical geography\", and she took an extended view of geography that included the Earth, its animal, \"vegetable inhabitants\", as well as \"the past and present condition of man, the origin, manners, and languages of existing nations, and the monuments of those that have been\".[74]/nPhysical Geography starts with describing the overall structure of planet Earth, along with a brief allusion to the location of the Earth within the Solar System. Subsequently, the book focuses on terrestrial topics, such as the most basic features of land and water, and formations such as mountains, volcanoes, oceans, rivers and lakes. Somerville goes on to discuss the elements that govern temperature, such as light, electricity, storms, the aurora and magnetism. Eventually the book turns to vegetation, birds and mammals, and their geographical distribution in the Arctic, Europe, Asia, Africa, America and the Antarctic. Somerville ends the book with a discussion of \"the distribution, condition, and future prospects of the human race\".[75] She emphasises the reciprocal dependencies in physical geography and the relationship between human beings and nature. In line with Victorian thinking, Somerville asserts the superiority of human beings, but maintains the interdependencies and interconnectedness of creation.[76] Physical Geography sold more copies than any of her other books and earned Humboldt's admiration. After receiving a copy of the book he wrote to her: \"You alone could provide your literature with an original cosmological work\".[77]/nHer fourth book, Molecular and Microscopic Science, took 10 years to write. Published in 1869, she soon had doubts about devoting herself to popularising science, instead of concentrating on mathematics alone.[78] Of the book she said: \"In writing this book I made a great mistake, and repent it - Mathematics are the natural bent of my mind. If I had devoted myself exclusively to that study, I might probably have written something useful, as a new era had begun in that science.\"[79] Regardless, the book was another success. It gave an up-to-date description of the latest discoveries revealed through the microscope and was published in two volumes and three parts. In the first part Somerville explained the latest thinking on atoms and molecules, the second covered plant life, while the third explored animal life. The book included 180 illustrations, which caused her publisher great expense.[80]/nShe was elected to the American Geographical and Statistical Society in 1857 and the Italian Geographical Society in 1870, and was made a member of the American Philosophical Society.[81]/nFrom 1833 onwards Somerville and her husband spent most of their time in Italy. Somerville maintained correspondence with a large number of leading scientists and remained engaged in current debates on facts and theories.[73]/nIn 1868, four years before her death at 91, she was the first person to sign John Stuart Mill's unsuccessful petition for female suffrage.[82] In her autobiography Somerville wrote that \"British laws are adverse to women\". She detailed the obstacles she had faced in obtaining an education as a young girl, though she did not speculate on the nature of the problem. During her lifetime agitation had grown for women's access to higher education. In 1875  astronomer Maria Mitchell was told by a college president that he \"would hire a woman scientist if she was as good as Mary Somerville\".[83]/nSomerville died at Naples on 29 November 1872,[57] and was buried there in the English Cemetery.[84]/nIn the year following Somerville's death, her autobiographical Personal Recollections was published, consisting of reminiscences written during her old age. Over 10,000 pages are in the Somerville Collection of the Bodleian Library and Somerville College, Oxford.[73][85] The collection includes papers relating to her writing and published work, and correspondence with family members, scientists and writers, as well as other figures in public life. Also included is substantial correspondence with the Byron and Lovelace families./nHer shell collection was given to Somerville College, Oxford by her descendants.[86]/nSomerville Square in Burntisland is named after her family and marks the site of their home.[10]/nSomerville College, Oxford, was named after Somerville, as are Somerville House, Burntisland, where she lived for a time, [41] and Somerville House, a high school for girls in Brisbane, Australia.[87] One of the Committee Rooms of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh has been named after her.[88]/nSomerville Island (74\u00b044\u2032N 96\u00b010\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff74.733\u00b0N 96.167\u00b0W\ufeff / 74.733; -96.167), a small island in Barrow Strait, Nunavut, was named after her by Sir William Edward Parry in 1819.[89]/nThe Somerville Club was founded in 1878 in London, by 1887 it was re-established as the New Somerville Club, and it disappeared by 1908.[90]/nThe vessel Mary Somerville was launched in 1835 at Liverpool. She traded with India for Taylor, Potter & Co., of Liverpool, and disappeared with the loss of all aboard in late 1852 or early 1853./nMary Somerville is featured in miniature in The English Bijou Almanack, 1837, with poetry by Letitia Elizabeth Landon./n5771 Somerville (1987 ST1) is a main-belt asteroid discovered on 21 September 1987 by E.

It lies to the east of the prominent crater Langrenus.[92] It is one of a handful of lunar craters named after women./nIn February 2016 Somerville was shortlisted, along with Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell and civil engineer Thomas Telford, in a public competition run by the Royal Bank of Scotland to decide whose face should appear on the bank's new \u00a310 notes, to be issued in 2017.[93][94] Later that month RBS announced that she had won the public vote, held on Facebook.[95] The banknotes, bearing her image, were issued in the second half of 2017.[96]/nOn 2 February 2020, Google celebrated her with a Google Doodle.[97]/nOn 1 April 2022, a satellite named after Somerville (\u00d1uSat 26, COSPAR 2022-033) was launched into space as part of the Satellogic Aleph-1 satellite constellation.[98]/nFrom her first marriage she had a son, Woronzow Greig (1805\u20131865), named after Count Semyon Vorontsov, the Russian ambassador in London who had appointed Samuel Greig as his Consul General. Woronzow married Agnes Graham but all their children died at birth or in infancy.[10]/nFrom her second marriage she had three daughters and one son: Margaret Farquhar Somerville (1813\u20131823; died in childhood), Thomas Somerville (1814\u20131815; died in infancy), Martha Charters Somerville (1815\u20131879) and Mary Charlotte Somerville (1817\u20131875). Her two surviving daughters spent most of their lives caring for Mary.[10]", "72231020": "Mikhail Shlyomovich Birman (Russian: \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0428\u043b\u0451\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0411\u0438\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d; born 17 January 1928 in Leningrad; died 2 July 2009) was a Russian mathematician and university professor. His research included functional analysis, partial differential equations and mathematical physics. In particular, he did research in the fields of scattering theory, operators in Hilbert spaces and the spectral theory of differential operators.[1]/nTogether with Mikhail Zakharovich Solomyak he developed the theory of double operator integrals./nBirman was born in 1928 in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) to a father that was a professor and specialist in theoretical mechanics and a mother that was a school teacher. During the Second World War the family fled to Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg). After the war the family went back to Leningrad. In 1950 Birman graduated from the Mathematical-Mechanical Faculty of Leningrad University with a diploma. Although Birman was one of the best students, he was denied a doctorate at Leningrad University because of his Jewish origins and the state antisemitic policy of the time. In 1947 he married Tatyana Petrovna Ilyina. Eventually in 1954 he did his doctorate at the Leningrad Mining University./nIn 1956 he joined the Department of Mathematical Physics at the Physics Faculty of Leningrad University.

Judging from the number of manuscript copies that survive today, for the next 400\u00a0years it became the most widely read book on that subject.[1][2] He also wrote a short textbook which was widely read and influential in Europe during the later medieval centuries as an introduction to astronomy. In his longest book, on the computation of the date of Easter, Sacrobosco correctly described the defects of the then-used Julian calendar, and recommended a solution similar to the modern Gregorian calendar three centuries before its implementation.[1]/nVery little is known about the education and biography of Sacrobosco. For one thing, his year of death has been guessed at 1236, 1244, and 1256, each of which is plausible and each lacking adequate evidence.[1]/nThe country in which he was born is uncertain. Robertus Anglicus wrote in 1271 that Sacrobosco was born in England.[3] That could be true, yet there is neither good supporting nor good contradicting evidence for it. Based on Anglicus writing so soon after Sacrobosco's death, a birthplace in England may deserve greater credence than later suggestions./nAmong those other possibilities, several different tenuous efforts have been made to figure out his birthplace from his appellative name de\u00a0Sacrobosco. Long after his death, Johannes de Sacrobosco was called and sometimes is still called by the name John of Holywood or John of Holybush, a name which was constructed by post-hoc reverse translation of the Medieval Latin sacer boscus, \"holy (sacred) wood\". Sacer Boscus or Romance Sacro Bosco as such is an unknown town or region. One traditional report, that he was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, is the speculation of a 16th-century antiquary, John Leland,[1]:\u200a176\u2013177\u200a which was discredited by William Camden: Halifax[4] means \"holy hair\", not \"holy wood\".[1]:\u200a177/nThomas Dempster identified Sacrobosco with an Augustinian canon from Holywood Abbey, Nithsdale,[a] which would be a reason for supposing him to have been born in Scotland.[1][5] The historian John Veitch claimed that he was born in Galloway and studied the classics among the monks of Whithorn and Dryburgh.[6]/nBased on a suggestion by Stanihurst, Holywood, County Down also claims Sacrobosco. However, Pederson attributes this assertion to Holywood being familiar to Stanihurst. A similar claim is made that he was born in Holywood, County Wicklow, but there is no known supporting historical document./nPederson mentioned that James Ware, writing in 1639, believed that the birthplace of Sacrobosco was near Dublin.[1] Stanihurst and even Pederson were probably unaware that the seat of the Sacrobosco / Hollywood family in Ireland was in Artane, a suburb of Dublin.[7] Local historical records in Ireland seem to indicate that Johannes de Sacrobosco was a member of the Hollywood family, born in Artane Castle.[8][1]:\u200a177\u2013178/nThe story that he was educated at the University of Oxford is no better documented than the stories on his place of birth.[1]:\u200a177/nAccording to a seventeenth-century account, he arrived at the University of Paris on 5\u00a0June 1221, but whether as a student or as a graduate (licentiate \u2013 one already having a Master of Arts degree from another university, and thus qualified to teach) is unclear.[1]:\u200a175\u2013182\u200a In due course, he began to teach the mathematical disciplines at the University of Paris./nThe year of his death is uncertain, with evidence supporting the years 1234, 1236, 1244, and 1256.[1]:\u200a186\u2013189,\u200a192\u200a The inscription marking his burial place in the monastery of Saint-Mathurin, Paris, described him as a \"computist\" \u2013 one who was an expert on calculating the date of Easter.[1]:\u200a181/nOn 14 May 2021, asteroid 14541 Sacrobosco, discovered by Czech astronomers Jana Tich\u00e1 and Milo\u0161 Tich\u00fd in 1997, was named in his memory.[9]/nAbout 1230, his best-known work, Tractatus de Sphaera / De Sphaera Mundi (Treatise on the Sphere / On the Sphere of the World) was published. In this book, Sacrobosco gives a readable account of the Ptolemaic universe. Ptolemy's (updated) Almagest had been translated into Latin in 1175 by Gerard of Cremona from the Arabic translation held in Toledo and copies had quickly found their way to Paris. In addition Sacrobosco was able to draw on translations of the Arabic astronomers Thabit ibn Qurra, al-Biruni, al-Urdi, and al-Fargani.[10]/nThe \"sphere\" Sacrobosco was referring to is the celestial sphere \u2013 an imaginary backdrop of the stars in the sky \u2013 which was the meaning of the word mundi (\"world\") at that time, not the planet Earth. Though principally about astronomy, in its first chapter the book also contains a clear description of the Earth as a sphere. De Sphaera Mundi was required reading by students in all western European universities for the next four hundred years./nSacrobosco's Algorismus a.k.a. De Arte Numerandi is thought to have been his first work, and the date is estimated at about 1225, and before 1230. The Hindu\u2013Arabic methods of numerical calculation had arrived in Latin Europe during the previous fifty years but had not been disseminated on a wide scale. Sacrobosco's Algorismus was the first text to introduce Hindu\u2013Arabic numerals and arithmetical procedures into the European university curriculum.[2][1]:\u200a199\u2013200/nSacrobosco may now be most famous for his criticism of the Julian calendar. In his c.\u20091235 book on computation of Easter's date, De Anni Ratione [On Reckoning Years], he maintained that the calendar had accumulated an error of 10\u00a0days and that some correction was needed./nThe Julian calendar was instituted in the 1st\u00a0century BCE. The Julian calendar year contained 365.25\u00a0days, with the 0.25\u00a0day provided for by a Leap year once every fourth year. However, the more precise length of a solar year is about 365.2422\u00a0days. By the 13th\u00a0century, the less accurate 365.25\u00a0days had resulted in an accumulated error of about 10\u00a0days in the date of the vernal equinox.

At 18, he became a pupil of Heinrich Pestalozzi and afterwards studied at Heidelberg. Then, he went to Berlin, earning a livelihood there, as in Heidelberg, by tutoring. Here he became acquainted with A. L. Crelle, who, encouraged by his ability and by that of Niels Henrik Abel, then also staying at Berlin, founded his famous Journal (1826)./nAfter Steiner's publication (1832) of his Systematische Entwickelungen he received, through Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, who was then professor at K\u00f6nigsberg University, and earned an honorary degree there; and through the influence of Jacobi and of the brothers Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt a new chair of geometry was founded for him at Berlin (1834). This he occupied until his death in Bern on 1 April 1863./nHe was described by Thomas Hirst as follows:/nSteiner's mathematical work was mainly confined to geometry. This he treated synthetically, to the total exclusion of analysis, which he hated,[1] and he is said to have considered it a disgrace to synthetic geometry if equal or higher results were obtained by analytical geometry methods. In his own field he surpassed all his contemporaries. His investigations are distinguished by their great generality, by the fertility of his resources, and by the rigour in his proofs. He has been considered the greatest pure geometer since Apollonius of Perga./nIn his Systematische Entwickelung der Abh\u00e4ngigkeit geometrischer Gestalten von einander he laid the foundation of modern synthetic geometry. In projective geometry even parallel lines have a point in common: a point at infinity. Thus two points determine a line and two  lines determine a point. The symmetry of point and line  is expressed as projective duality. Starting with perspectivities, the transformations of projective geometry are formed by composition, producing projectivities. Steiner identified sets preserved  by projectivities such as a projective range and pencils. He is particularly remembered for his approach to a conic section by way of projectivity called the Steiner conic./nIn a second little volume, Die geometrischen Constructionen ausgef\u00fchrt mittels der geraden Linie und eines festen Kreises (1833), republished in 1895 by Ottingen, he shows, what had been already suggested by J. V. Poncelet, how all problems of the second order can be solved by aid of the straight edge alone without the use of compasses, as soon as one circle is given on the drawing-paper. He also wrote \"Vorlesungen \u00fcber synthetische Geometrie\", published posthumously at Leipzig by C. F. Geiser and H. Schroeter in 1867; a third edition by R. Sturm was published in 1887\u20131898./nOther geometric results by Steiner include development of a formula for the partitioning of space by planes (the maximal number of parts created by n planes), several theorems about the famous Steiner's chain of tangential circles, and a proof of the isoperimetric theorem (later a flaw was found in the proof, but was corrected by Weierstrass)./nThe rest of Steiner's writings are found in numerous papers mostly published in Crelle's Journal, the first volume of which contains his first four papers. The most important are those relating to algebraic curves and surfaces, especially the short paper Allgemeine Eigenschaften algebraischer Curven. This contains only results, and there is no indication of the method by which they were obtained, so that, according to O. Hesse, they are, like Fermat's theorems, riddles to the present and future generations. Eminent analysts succeeded in proving some of the theorems, but it was reserved to Luigi Cremona to prove them all, and that by a uniform synthetic method, in his book on algebraic curves./nOther important investigations relate to maxima and minima. Starting from simple elementary propositions, Steiner advances to the solution of problems which analytically require the calculus of variations, but which at the time altogether surpassed the powers of that calculus. Connected with this is the paper Vom Kr\u00fcmmungsschwerpuncte ebener Curven, which contains numerous properties of pedals and roulettes, especially of their areas./nSteiner also made a small but important contribution to combinatorics.

Some of these students were children of prominent families, among them sons of Sir Charles Locock, obstetrician to Queen Victoria.[5] One of Blissard's students, Antonius Ameuney, a Syrian Christian studying in England who later matriculated at Kings College and ultimately became professor of Arabic Language and Literature there,[6] wrote of this time, \"the Committee of the Society \u2026 sent me to the Rev. John Blissard, of Hampstead Norris, in Berkshire, to complete my studies prior to entering at College. It was during this time that I learned how a truly conscientious and active minister of the church spends his time. Mr. and Mrs. Blissard were constantly employed in some good and benevolent act: their parishioners' welfare was their perpetual care, and they labored earnestly in bringing up their family in the fear of God.\"[7] The obituary of one of Blissard's sons, John Charles, records that he \"received his early education with his father's pupils\".[8] Both of Blissard's sons were Wranglers in the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos: John Charles was 34th Wrangler in 1858; William was 26th Wrangler in 1860.[9]/nSeveral years after Blissard's death, the church of Hampstead Norris, an eleventh-century Norman structure dedicated to St. Mary the Virgin, underwent a substantial renovation, and now contains a number of memorials to Blissard. These include the stone pulpit contributed by the sons of Sir Charles Locock and a number of other fixtures contributed by Blissard's family and students./nIn 1861, Blissard published \"Theory of generic equations\" describing a system that allows certain sequences of numbers, b0, b1, b2, \u2026, to be manipulated algebraically as powers, b0, b1, b2, \u2026, so as to produce valid formulas. The Bernoulli numbers are a prime example of such a sequence. Blissard called his system \"representative notation\"; it is often referred to as \"Blissard's symbolic method\", but is most often called \"umbral calculus\", a term coined by J. J. Sylvester./nBlissard published nine additional papers in The Quarterly Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics, many of them applying the representative notation and developing it further. He also regularly contributed problems and solutions to the Educational Times, some of which made use of representative notation.  He also published two papers in The Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin Messenger of Mathematics./nThe number theorist \u00c9douard Lucas rediscovered Blissard's ideas, publishing fifteen years later.[10]\nE.\u00a0T. Bell argues that, although related notational devices due to mathematicians such as Leibniz, Aronhold, and Cayley, which show up in the theory of finite differences, in invariant theory, and in the theory of determinants, share a common mathematical foundation with Blissard's symbolic notation, this was only appreciated in retrospect by Neikirk.[11] The method came to be widely applied in combinatorics, particularly in the book of John Riordan, but its foundations were regarded as suspect by many mathematicians. Starting in the 1970s, Gian-Carlo Rota and coauthors undertook a system investigations of the foundations of the theory, a development that continues to this day./nMartha and John Blissard had twelve children.[12] John Blissard's obituary records that, \"Three of the youngest children died some years ago from fever within a week, and two of them were buried on the same day. The remainder of his family survive\u2026.\"[13] Census records, however, show seven children living in the household.[14] Much of Blissard's family was involved with the Church. Blissard's eldest child, Mary Lewis (1827\u20131872), married Philip A. Longmore, who served as vicar of Hermitage, which had been split off from Hampstead Norris parish during the tenure of Blissard's predecessor. Blissard's two surviving sons John Charles (1835\u20131904) and William (1836\u20131918) both studied at Cambridge, both taught mathematics for a time, (John Charles at the Cheam School, William at Sedbergh School and King's School, Canterbury), and both became clergyman. For many decades, John Charles held the incumbency at St Augustine's Church, Edgbaston in Birmingham.[15]  William was vicar of Seasalter, and then rector at Bishopsbourne. He was known for his books of social criticism, including The Ethic of Usury and Interest and The Economic Anti-Christ: A Study in Social Polity.[16]", "61909148": "Dona Anschel Papert Strauss (born April 1934)[1] is a South African mathematician working in topology and functional analysis.

From a young age he had to work in the fields, but he also received lessons in Latin, German, English and in mathematics, which he liked most. From 1771 till 1775 he studied at the Christianeum High School in Altona, then part of both Denmark and Germany. Starting from 1775, he entered the University of G\u00f6ttingen (some sources say he studied at the University of Kiel[1][2]) and attended mathematics lectures of Abraham Gotthelf K\u00e4stner, which were rather popular among students, including Struve. In 1780, through the assistance of one of his teachers, Christian Gottlob Heyne, Struve obtained a position of vice-principal in a Latin school in Hanover. In 1783, he became a school principal in B\u00fcckeburg and from 1784 held the same position in Hanover.

This might have affected further settlement of part of the Struve family in the Russian Empire (mostly in Tartu). In particular, many sons of Struve left Germany, likely to avoid recruitment to the Napoleonic armies.[5][6]/nIn 1791, Struve became a professor at the Christianeum High School in Altona where he had graduated from, and from 1794 till his retirement in 1827 served as the school director. In the meantime, he continued his studies in the fields of algebra, geometry, probability theory and number theory, which were based on the works of K\u00e4stner, Leonhard Euler and Georg Simon Kl\u00fcgel. His results were published between 1800 and 1827 in more than 20 articles. In 1813, Struve obtained a doctoral degree from the University of Kiel.

His 1995 textbook Foundations of Quantum Group Theory is a standard text still used by researchers today. He also pioneered a quantum groups approach to noncommutative geometry and the use of such methods as a route to quantum gravity,[1][2] leading in 1994 to the first model with testable predictions of quantum spacetime. He is also known for a range of results in algebra and category theory, notably for his theory of braided Hopf algebras and for a new view of the octonions. Although many regard Majid as a pure mathematician, his motivation and early training was in theoretical physics, and pure mathematics merely represents a path in his lifelong search for the 'true nature of physical reality'.[3][4]/nIn 2008, he edited and co-authored an ambitious book of essays On Space and Time along with Alain Connes, Roger Penrose, John Polkinghorne, Michal Heller and Andrew Taylor, in which the authors aim to expose the frontier of scientific research on the small and large scale structure of the Universe to a general but scientifically interested audience./nAt age five, he moved with his family from India to the UK, where his father went on to become a noted orthopaedic surgeon and his mother a primary school teacher and a published poet. He grew up in Hampstead, London, where he now lives, is married to Konstanze Rietsch, a University of Vienna and MIT trained pure mathematician based at King's College London, and has two children./nHe did his B.A. and Part III diploma at the University of Cambridge following the Mathematical Tripos and based at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. In 1983, he was awarded a Herschel Smith Scholarship, which took him to Harvard University. At Harvard, he was a tutor at Eliot House, while engaged in his PhD jointly between the physics and pure mathematics departments, under Arthur Jaffe and Clifford Taubes respectively. Armed with his PhD in 1988, his first job was as a 1-year postdoc at the University of Swansea, before moving on a Drapers Fellowship to Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he remained a Fellow until his move to Queen Mary in 1999. The 10 years of research based in Cambridge University, DAMTP included two years as a visiting scholar back at Harvard and a variety of research fellowships including a Royal Society University Research Fellowship. In 1993, he was awarded a one-time Konrad Bleuler Medal by an international conference. He has been visiting professor at the Perimeter Institute, Oxford University, and Cambridge University, as well as a principal organiser along with Alain Connes and Albert Schwarz of a 6-month programme on noncommutative geometry at the Isaac Newton Institute in 2006. In 2009, he was a Leverhulme Trust Senior Research Fellow./nMajid wrote several early papers before his more established PhD work.[5][6] These included work on gauge fields as Fourier transform on the space of loops on a manifold and their quantisation as noncommutative geometry, a novel 'infinite spin' limit for handling infinities in quantum field theory and an infinitesimal explanation of quark confinement./nHis 1988 PhD thesis introduced a 'bicrossproduct' type of quantum group at a time when few such objects were known. Halfway through his PhD research Vladimir Drinfeld and Michio Jimbo found another and more popular class of these objects, but the bicrossproduct ones have had a resurgence of interest in recent years. Majid rapidly established himself as a leading authority on all types of quantum groups and developed a distinctive Hopf algebraic approach to them, including well-known results on the quantum double and a duality construction for a monoidal category. His 1998 lectures on the topic in the Mathematical Tripos of the University of Cambridge were published by the London Mathematical Society./nIn the 1990s, Majid introduced the theory of braided groups or braided Hopf algebras as the true objects underlying \n\n\n\nq\n\n\n{\\displaystyle q}\n\n-deformations. He proved the main theorems in the field of 'transmutation' and 'bosonisation' and constructed the first and still main examples of the theory, including quantum planes as an additive braided groups. Other well-known work includes a picture of the octonions as associative in a certain symmetric monoidal category./nAlso in the 1990s he pioneered the theory and first models of noncommutative or quantum spacetimes. The 1994 Majid-Ruegg model in particular turned out to be testable by data now being collected by the GLAST-Fermi gamma ray space telescope. Whether his model is confirmed or not, the most important thing, according to Majid, is that unlike much of modern theoretical physics, it is testable. Recent works include theorems pointing to a new field of nonassociative geometry, noncommutative gravity and (2+1)-dimensional quantum gravity./n\"Nature does not necessarily use the maths already in maths books, hence theoretical physicists should be prepared to explore ... all of pure mathematics\"/nThis quote from Majid's On Space and Time was presented as reply to physicists who attack mathematicians while turning to maths books for structures to use in their theories, as if mathematics is a resource rather than part of the creative process. The subtle interplay between the creativity of pure mathematics and the fact-driven agenda of physics form the basis of a general philosophy of Relative Realism in which Majid argues that the nature of physical reality is not fundamentally different from the way that topics in pure mathematics are on the one hand created by definitions and on the other hand 'out there' waiting to be invented. Majid gives the more everyday example of the way that the reality experienced in a game of chess is created by the rules of chess and the choice to abide by them while at the same time, on another level, the rules of chess were themselves a reality waiting to be discovered by those seeking to invent board games. The general picture leads to a dualism between experiment and theory or 'principle of representation-theoretic self-duality' in which Majid argues that 'the search for the ultimate theory of physics is the search for self-dual structures in a self-dual category'.

Jevons' work, along with similar discoveries made by Carl Menger in Vienna (1871) and by L\u00e9on Walras in Switzerland (1874), marked the opening of a new period in the history of economic thought. Jevons's contribution to the marginal revolution in economics in the late 19th century established his reputation as a leading political economist and logician of the time./nJevons broke off his studies of the natural sciences in London in 1854 to work as an assayer in Sydney, where he acquired an interest in political economy. Returning to the UK in 1859, he published General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy in 1862, outlining the marginal utility theory of value, and A Serious Fall in the Value of Gold in 1863. For Jevons, the utility or value to a consumer of an additional unit of a product is inversely related to the number of units of that product he already owns, at least beyond some critical quantity./nJevons received public recognition for his work on The Coal Question (1865), in which he called attention to the gradual exhaustion of Britain's coal supplies and also put forth the view that increases in energy production efficiency leads to more, not less, consumption.[5]:\u200a7f,\u200a161f\u200a This view is known today as the Jevons paradox, named after him.

Among his inventions was the logic piano, a mechanical computer./nJevons was born in Liverpool, Lancashire, England. His father, Thomas Jevons, was an iron merchant who wrote about legal and economic subjects as well. His mother Mary Anne Jevons was the daughter of William Roscoe. At the age of fifteen he was sent to London to attend the University College School. Around this time, he seemed to have formed the belief that he was capable of important achievements as a thinker. Towards the end of 1853, after having spent two years at University College, where his favourite subjects were chemistry and botany, he received an offer as metallurgical assayer for the new mint in Australia. The idea of leaving the UK was distasteful, but pecuniary considerations had, in consequence of the failure of his father's firm in 1847, become of vital importance, and he accepted the post.[9]/nJevons left the UK for Sydney in June 1854 to take up a role as an Assayer at the Mint. Jevons lived with his colleague and his wife first at Church Hill, then in Annangrove at Petersham and at Double Bay before returning to England. In letters to his family he described his life, took photographs and produced a social map of Sydney. Jevons returned to England via America five years later.[10]/nHe resigned his appointment, and in the autumn of 1859 re-entered the University College London as a student. He was granted B.A. and M.A. degrees from the University of London. He now gave his principal attention to the moral sciences, but his interest in natural science was by no means exhausted: throughout his life he continued to write occasional papers on scientific subjects, and his knowledge of the physical sciences greatly contributed to the success of his chief logical work, The Principles of Science. Not long after taking his M.A. degree, Jevons obtained a post as tutor at Owens College, Manchester.\nIn 1866, he was elected professor of logic and mental and moral philosophy and Cobden professor of political economy at Owens College.[9]/nJevons arrived quite early in his career at the doctrines that constituted his most characteristic and original contributions to economics and logic. The theory of utility, which became the keynote of his general theory of political economy, was practically formulated in a letter written in 1860;[11] and the germ of his logical principles of the substitution of similars may be found in the view which he propounded in another letter written in 1861, that \"philosophy would be found to consist solely in pointing out the likeness of things.\" The theory of utility above referred to, namely, that the degree of utility of a commodity is some continuous mathematical function of the quantity of the commodity available, together with the implied doctrine that economics is essentially a mathematical science, took more definite form in a paper on \"A General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy\", written for the British Association in 1862. This paper does not appear to have attracted much attention either in 1862 or on its publication four years later in the Journal of the Statistical Society; and it was not till 1871, when the Theory of Political Economy appeared, that Jevons set forth his doctrines in a fully developed form.[9]/nIt was not until after the publication of this work that Jevons became acquainted with the applications of mathematics to political economy made by earlier writers, notably Antoine Augustin Cournot and H.H. Gossen. The theory of utility was at about 1870 being independently developed on somewhat similar lines by Carl Menger in Austria and L\u00e9on Walras in Switzerland. As regards the discovery of the connection between value in exchange and final (or marginal) utility, the priority belongs to Gossen, but this in no way detracts from the great importance of the service which Jevons rendered to British economics by his fresh discovery of the principle, and by the way in which he ultimately forced it into notice. In his reaction from the prevailing view he sometimes expressed himself without due qualification: the declaration, for instance, made at the commencement of the Theory of Political Economy, that value depends entirely upon utility, lent itself to misinterpretation. But a certain exaggeration of emphasis may be pardoned in a writer seeking to attract the attention of an indifferent public.[9] The Neoclassical Revolution, which would reshape economics, had been started.[citation needed]/nJevons did not explicitly distinguish between the concepts of ordinal and cardinal utility. Cardinal utility allows the relative magnitude of utilities to be discussed, while ordinal utility only implies that goods can be compared and ranked according to which good provided the most utility. Although Jevons predated the debate about ordinality or cardinality of utility, his mathematics required the use of cardinal utility functions. For example, in \"The Theory of Political Economy\", Chapter II, the subsection on \"Theory of Dimensions of Economic Quantities\", Jevons makes the statement that \"In the first place, pleasure and pain must be regarded as measured upon the same scale, and as having, therefore, the same dimensions, being quantities of the same kind, which can be added and subtracted....\" Speaking of measurement, addition and subtraction requires cardinality, as does Jevons's heavy use of integral calculus. Cardinality does not imply direct measurability, in which Jevons did not believe.[citation needed]/nIt was not, however, as a theorist dealing with the fundamental data of economic science, but as a writer on practical economic questions, that Jevons first received general recognition. A Serious Fall in the Value of Gold (1863) and The Coal Question (1865) placed him in the front rank as a writer on applied economics and statistics; and he would be remembered as one of the leading economists of the 19th century even had his Theory of Political Economy never been written. His economic works include Money and the Mechanism of Exchange (1875) written in a popular style, and descriptive rather than theoretical; a Primer on Political Economy (1878); The State in Relation to Labour (1882), and two works published after his death, Methods of Social Reform\" and \"Investigations in Currency and Finance, containing papers that had appeared separately during his lifetime. The last-named volume contains Jevons's speculations on the connection between commercial crises and sunspots. He was engaged at the time of his death upon the preparation of a large treatise on economics and had drawn up a table of contents and completed some chapters and parts of chapters. This fragment was published in 1905 under the title of The Principles of Economics: a fragment of a treatise on the industrial mechanism of society, and other papers.[9]/nIn The Coal Question, Jevons covered a breadth of concepts on energy depletion that have recently been revisited by writers covering the subject of peak oil. For example, Jevons explained that improving energy efficiency typically reduced energy costs and thereby increased rather than decreased energy use, an effect now known as the Jevons paradox. The Coal Question remains a paradigmatic study of resource depletion theory. Jevons's son, H. Stanley Jevons, published an 800-page follow-up study in 1915 in which the difficulties of estimating recoverable reserves of a theoretically finite resource are discussed in detail.[12]/nIn 1875, Jevons read a paper On the influence of the sun-spot period upon the price of corn at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. This captured the attention of the media and led to the coining of the word sunspottery for claims of links between various cyclic events and sun-spots. In a later work, \"Commercial Crises and Sun-Spots\",[13] Jevons analyzed business cycles, proposing that crises in the economy might not be random events, but might be based on discernible prior causes. To clarify the concept, he presented a statistical study relating business cycles with sunspots. His reasoning was that sunspots affected the weather, which, in turn, affected crops. Crop changes could then be expected to cause economic changes. Subsequent studies have found that sunny weather has a small but significant positive impact on stock returns, probably due to its impact on traders' moods.[14]/nIn 1864 Jevons published Pure Logic; or, the Logic of Quality apart from Quantity, which was based on Boole's system of logic, but freed from what he considered the false mathematical dress of that system. In 1866 what he regarded as the great and universal principle of all reasoning dawned upon him; and in 1869 Jevons published a sketch of this fundamental doctrine under the title of The Substitution of Similars.[15] He expressed this principle in its simplest form by saying: \"Whatever is true of a thing is true of its like\", and he worked out in detail its various applications[9] including the logical abacus, a method of performing simple logical inference by manipulating a truth table consisting of labeled wooden boards.[16][17] He noted that the operations could be performed by a simple mechanism and later he had a \"logical machine\" built from his specifications in 1869, sometimes called the \"Logic Piano\" because of its resemblance to an upright piano.[18][19][20] The machine was exhibited before the Royal Society in 1870.[citation needed]/nIn the following year appeared the Elementary Lessons on Logic, which soon became the most widely read elementary textbook on logic in the English language. In the meantime he was engaged upon a much more important logical treatise, which appeared in 1874 under the title of The Principles of Science. In this work Jevons embodied the substance of his earlier works on pure logic and the substitution of similars; he also enunciated and developed the view that induction is simply an inverse employment of deduction; he treated in a luminous manner the general theory of probability, and the relation between probability and induction; and his knowledge of the various natural sciences enabled him throughout to relieve the abstract character of logical doctrine by concrete scientific illustrations, often worked out in great detail.[21] An example is his discussion of the use of one-way functions in cryptography, including remarks on the integer factorization problem that foreshadowed its use in public-key cryptography.[citation needed] Jevons's general theory of induction was a revival of the theory laid down by Whewell and criticised by John Stuart Mill; but it was put in a new form, and was free from some of the non-essential adjuncts that rendered Whewell's exposition open to attack. The work as a whole was one of the most notable contributions to logical doctrine that appeared in the UK in the 19th century. \"Though less attractively written than Mill's System of Logic, Principles of Science is a book that keeps much closer to the facts of scientific practice.\"[22] His Studies in Deductive Logic, consisting mainly of exercises and problems for the use of students, was published in 1880. In 1877 and the following years Jevons contributed to the Contemporary Review some articles on Mill, which he had intended to supplement by further articles, and eventually publish in a volume as a criticism of Mill's philosophy. These articles and one other were republished after Jevons's death, together with his earlier logical treatises, in a volume, entitled Pure Logic, and other Minor Works.[23] The articles on criticisms of Mill contain much that is ingenious and much that is forcible, but on the whole they cannot be regarded as taking rank with Jevons's other work. His strength lay in his power as an original thinker rather than as a critic; and he will be remembered by his constructive work as logician, economist and statistician.[24]/nJevons wrote in his 1874 book Principles of Science:/nThis became known as Jevons's number and was factored by Charles J. Busk in 1889,[26] Derrick Norman Lehmer in 1903,[27] and later on a pocket calculator by Solomon W. Golomb.[28] It is the product of two prime numbers, 89,681 and 96,079./nOne of Jevons's contemporaries, Hermann von Helmholtz, who was interested in non-Euclidean geometry,[29] discussed two groups of two-dimensional creatures with one group living in the plane while the other living in the surface of a sphere. He asserted that since these creatures were embedded in two dimensions, they would develop a planar version of Euclidean geometry, but that since the nature of these surfaces were different, they would arrive at very different versions of this geometry. He then extended this argument into three dimensions, noting that this raises fundamental questions of the relationship of spatial perception to mathematical truth.[30][31][32]/nJevons made an almost immediate response to this article. While Helmholtz focused on how humans perceived space, Jevons focused on the question of truth in geometry. Jevons agreed that while Helmholtz's argument was compelling in constructing a situation where the Euclidean axioms of geometry would not apply, he believed that they had no effect on the truth of these axioms. Jevons hence makes the distinction between truth and applicability or perception, suggesting that these concepts were independent in the domain of geometry./nJevons did not claim that geometry was developed without any consideration for spatial reality. Instead, he suggested that his geometric systems were representations of reality but in a more fundamental way that transcends what one can perceive about reality.[33] Jevons claimed that there was a flaw in Helmholtz's argument relating to the concept of infinitesimally small. This concept involves how these creatures reason about geometry and space at a very small scale, which is not necessarily the same as the reasoning that Helmholtz assumed on a more global scale. Jevons claimed that the Euclidean relations could be reduced locally in the different scenarios that Helmholtz created and hence the creatures should have been able to experience the Euclidean properties, just in a different representation. For example, Jevons claimed that the two-dimensional creatures living on the surface of a sphere should be able to construct the plane and even construct systems of higher dimensions and that although they may not be able to perceive such situations in reality, it would reveal fundamental mathematical truths in their theoretical existence.[34]/nIn 1872, Helmholtz gave a response to Jevons, who claimed that Helmholtz failed to show why geometric truth should be separate from the reality of spatial perception. Helmholtz criticized Jevons's definition of truth and in particular, experiential truth. Helmholtz asserts that there should be a difference between experiential truth and mathematical truth and that these versions of truth are not necessarily consistent. This conversation between Helmholtz and Jevons was a microcosm of an ongoing debate between truth and perception in the wake of the introduction of non-Euclidean geometry in the late 19th century.[35]/nIn 1867, Jevons married Harriet Ann Taylor, whose father, John Edward Taylor, had been the founder and proprietor of the Manchester Guardian. Jevons suffered from ill health and sleeplessness, and found the delivery of lectures covering so wide a range of subjects very burdensome. In 1876, he was glad to exchange the Owens professorship for the professorship of political economy in University College, London. Travelling and music were the principal recreations of his life; but his health continued to be bad, and he suffered from depression. He found his professorial duties increasingly irksome, and feeling that the pressure of literary work left him no spare energy, he decided in 1880 to resign the post. On 13 August 1882 he drowned whilst bathing near Hastings.[9]/nJevons was brought up a Christian Unitarian.[36] Excerpts from his journals indicate he remained committed to his Christian beliefs until death. He is buried in the Hampstead Cemetery.[37]/nJevons was a prolific writer, and at the time of his death was a leader in the UK both as a logician and as an economist. Alfred Marshall said of his work in economics that it \"will probably be found to have more constructive force than any, save that of Ricardo, that has been done during the last hundred years.\"[9]/nJevons's theory of induction has continued to be influential: \"Jevons's general view of induction has received a powerful and original formulation in the work of a modern-day philosopher, Professor K. R. Popper.\"[22]/nWorks available online", "53291183": "Jean-Paul Bergeron (born October 21, 1947) is a Quebec politician.

[6] Nelson was baptised as a Protestant at the age of five on 13 June 1887.[7]\nNelson studied at Franz\u00f6sisches Gymnasium Berlin where mathematics and science were not notable in that school. He was therefore privately tutored by mathematician Gerhard Hessenberg (1874\u20131925), and began reading the works of philosophers Immanuel Kant, Jakob Friedrich Fries, and Ernst Friedrich Apelts, which began to spark his interest in philosophy./nIn 1901, Nelson studied mathematics and philosophy at Heidelberg University for a short period of time before going to  Friedrich Wilhelm University (today: Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t) in Berlin from March 1901 \u2013 1903.

It sets out to find a \"critique\" on science and metaphysics, similar to empiricism,[8] as things can only be true based on the perceptions and limitations on human minds.

It was here that Nelson and these same friends created the Jakob-Friedrich-Fries-Gesellschaft (Jakob Friedrich Fries Society) to promote critical philosophy.[9]/nReady to form new ideas, Nelson founded the Neo-Friesian School in 1903, with some well-known members, such as Rudolf Otto, philosopher (1869\u20131937), Gerhard Hessenberg, mathematician (1874\u20131925) and Otto Meyerhof. biochemist (1884\u20131951).

Another famous (and slightly incomplete) result is Shafarevich's theorem on solvable Galois groups, giving the realization of every finite solvable group as a Galois group over the rationals./nAnother development is the Golod\u2013Shafarevich theorem on towers of unramified extensions of number fields./nShafarevich and his school greatly contributed to the study of algebraic geometry of surfaces. He started a famous Moscow seminar on classification of algebraic surfaces that updated the treatment of birational geometry around 1960 and was largely responsible for the early introduction of the scheme theory approach to algebraic geometry in the Soviet school. His investigation in arithmetic of elliptic curves led him, independently of John Tate, to the introduction of the group related to elliptic curves over number fields, the Tate\u2013Shafarevich group (usually called 'Sha', and denoted as '\u0428', the first Cyrillic letter of his surname)./nHe contributed the Grothendieck\u2013Ogg\u2013Shafarevich formula and to the N\u00e9ron\u2013Ogg\u2013Shafarevich criterion./nWith former student Ilya Piatetski-Shapiro, he proved a version of the Torelli theorem for K3 surfaces./nHe formulated the Shafarevich conjecture, which stated the finiteness of the set of Abelian varieties over a number field having fixed dimension and prescribed set of primes of bad reduction. The conjecture was proved by Gerd Faltings as a partial step in his proof of the Mordell conjecture./nShafarevich's students included Yuri Manin, Alexey Parshin, Igor Dolgachev, Evgeny Golod, Alexei Kostrikin, Suren Arakelov, G. V. Belyi, Victor Abrashkin, Andrey Todorov, Andrey N. Tyurin, and Victor Kolyvagin./nHe was a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts in the department of Mathematics, Physics and Earth Sciences.\nIn 1960, he was elected a Member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.[2] In 1981, he was elected as a foreign member of the Royal Society.[3]/nIn 2017, Shafarevich was awarded the Leonhard Euler Gold Medal by the Russian Academy of Sciences./nShafarevich came into conflict with the Soviet authorities in the early 1950s but was protected by Ivan Petrovsky, the Rector of Moscow University. He belonged to a group of Pochvennichestvo-influenced dissidents who endorsed the Eastern Orthodox tradition. Shafarevich published a book, The Socialist Phenomenon (French edition 1975, English edition 1980), which was cited by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in his 1978 address to Harvard University./nIn the 1970s, Shafarevich, with Valery Chalidze, Grigori Podyapolski and Andrei Tverdokhlebov, became one of Andrei Sakharov's human rights investigators and so was dismissed from Moscow University. Shafarevich opposed political interference in universities./nShafarevich's book The Socialist Phenomenon,[4] which was published in the US by Harper & Row in 1980, analyzed numerous examples of socialism from ancient times to various medieval heresies and a variety of modern thinkers and socialist states. From those examples, he claimed that all the basic principles of socialist ideology derive from the urge to suppress individualism. The Socialist Phenomenon consists of three major parts:[5]/nShafarevich argued that ancient socialism (such as Mesopotamia and Egypt) was not ideological, as an ideology socialism was a reaction to the emergence of individualism in the Axial Age. He compared Thomas More's (Utopia) and Tommaso Campanella's (City of the Sun) visions with what is known about the Inca Empire and concluded that there are striking similarities. He claimed that we become persons through our relationship with God and argued that socialism is essentially nihilistic and is unconsciously motivated by a death instinct. He concluded that we have the choice of pursuing death or life./nShafarevich adhered to Russian Orthodox Christianity and incorporated the neo-Platonic views of Eastern Orthodoxy into his understanding of the relation of mathematics and religion.[9]/nIn his talk to the G\u00f6ttingen Academy of Sciences upon receiving a prize, Shafarevich presented his view of the relationship between mathematics and religion. He noted the multiple discoveries in mathematics, such as that of non-Euclidean geometry, to suggest that pure mathematics reflects an objective reality, not a set of conventional definitions or a formalism. He claimed that the growth of mathematics itself is not directed or organic. To have a unity and direction, mathematics needs a goal. It can be practical applications or God as the source for the direction of development. Shafarevich opted for the latter, as pure mathematics is not in itself driven by practical applications.[10]/nFormer/nOn 21 December 1991 he took part in the first congress of the Russian All-People's Union, headed by Sergei Baburin. In October 1992, he became a member of the founding committee of the National Salvation Front. In 1993, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the State Duma with Mikhail Astafyev's Constitutional Democratic Party - Party of Popular Freedom./nShafarevich was a member of the editorial board of the magazine Nash Sovremennik and in 1991\u20131992 of the editorial board of Den of Alexander Prokhanov, which ceased publication in October 1993 and later reopened under the title Zavtra. In 1994, he joined the \"All-Russian National Right Wing Centre\", led by Mikhail Astafyev./nShafarevich's essay Russophobia[11] was expanded into his book Three Thousand-Year-Old Mystery (\u0422\u0440\u0435\u0445\u0442\u044b\u0441\u044f\u0447\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044f\u044f \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0430) and resulted in accusations of antisemitism.[12][13][14] He completed the Russophobia essay in 1982 and it was initially circulated as samizdat. In the Soviet Union, it was first officially published in 1989. At the same time, Shafarevich condemned the methods that were used to screen out applicants of Jewish origin when entering prestigious Moscow universities in the 1970s and early 1980s.[15]/nIn Russophobia, he argued in the essay that great nations experience periods in their history of reformist elitist groups ('small nations') having values that differ fundamentally from the values of the majority of the people but gaining the upper hand in the society. In Shafarevich's opinion, the role of such a 'small nation' in Russia was played by a small group of intelligentsiya, dominated by Jews, \"who were full of hatred against traditional Russian way of life and played an active role in the terrorist regimes of Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin\".[16][17]/nIts publication led to a request by the United States National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to Shafarevich to resign his membership,[18] because the NAS charter prohibited stripping an existing membership.[19][20] In an open letter to the NAS, Shafarevich explained that Russophobia is not antisemitic.[21] Shafarevich also noted that since NAS enlisted him without his request or knowledge, delisting him was its internal matter. Nevertheless, when the United States invaded Iraq, Shafarevich faxed his resignation.[22]/nAccusations of antisemitism continued and involved Shafarevich's other publications.[23] Semyon Reznik targets the Russophobia essay for factual inaccuracies: Shafarevich misassigned Jewish ethnicity to a number of non-Jews involved in the execution of Nicholas II, repeated the false assertion of graffiti in Yiddish at the murder site and suggested that Shafarevich's phrase \"Nicholas II was shot specifically as the Tsar, and this ritual act drew a line under an epoch in Russian history\" \u2013 is read by some as a blood libel.[16] (An accusation which ignores the remainder of Shafarevich's sentence: \"so it can only be compared with the execution of Charles I in England or of Louis XVI in France\".)[11] Aron Katsenelinboigen wrote that Shafarevish's work \"lives up to the best traditions of antisemitic propaganda\".[24]/nLater, Shafarevich expanded on his views in his book Three Thousand-Year-Old Mystery in which he further claimed that Jews effectively marginalise and exclude non-Jews in all types of intellectual endeavors. The work was published in Russian in 2002; an introductory section explains the relationship with the Russophobia essay, explaining that the essay developed from an appendix to an intended work of wider scope, which he started writing in samizdat.[25]/nIn 2005, Shafarevich was amongst the signatories  of the Letter of 5000./nThe issue of Shafarevich's alleged antisemitism has been the subject of a 2009 doctoral thesis at the University of Helsinki, which was later turned into a book[1] in which the author, Krista Berglund, stated that Shafarevich's views have been misconstrued as antisemitic.", "22194410": "Joshua Milne (1776\u20131851), was an English actuary.[1]/nHe was appointed actuary to the Sun Life Assurance Society on 15 June 1810, and reconstructed the life tables then in use.

He resigned his position in the Sun Life Office on 19 December 1843, and died at Upper Clapton on 4 January 1851. He was buried on the western side of Highgate Cemetery.[2]/nWhen Milne entered the field, life tables were based on the data taken by Richard Price from the burial registers (1735\u201380) of All Saints' Church, Northampton. Milne took as the basis of his calculations the bills of mortality from Carlisle, which had been prepared by John Heysham. After a long correspondence (12 September 1812 \u2013 14 June 1814) with Heysham, he published his major work A Treatise on the Valuation of Annuities and Assurances (1815).[3] Milne's new \"Carlisle table\" marked an epoch in actuarial science. Considering the narrow base of data from which he had to work, it was quite accurate, and was widely adopted by insurance societies. The Carlisle Table was largely superseded by that published by the Institute of Actuaries in 1870.[2] But it was still considered useful in the early 20th century.[4]/nSubsequent writers built on Milne's work.

Insp 7/IV), the signals intelligence agency Wehrmacht with the rank of specialist. Pietsch was assigned to the Army Signal Security Agency Referat IV of Insp 7/IV along with about a dozen other mathematicians that included several actuarial mathematicians.[3] This included the mathematicians Herbert von Denffer, Friedrich B\u00f6hm and Hans-Peter Luzius.[3] Referat IV dealt with analytical research, specifically security of own process and this included distribution of keys and security of the Enigma and security of hand ciphers and associated procedures./nBy late 1940, the organisational layout of Inspectorate 7/VI was found insufficient to handle the ever-increasing amounts of intercept traffic and a plan was formulated to reorganise the unit. In January 1941, the new unit, called Inspectorate 7/VI, became operational. Pietsch was assigned to both Referat 1 as deputy director with Steinberg as director and Referat 7 with Pietsch as deputy director with Friedrich B\u00f6hm as director.[2]/nOn 1 October 1941, Pietsch was promoted to Special leader (German: Sonderf\u00fchrer) and then, on 1 April 1942, to Staff Sargeant (German: Unteroffizier)[2] and left the German army with the rank of Baurat, a senior service rank in the German civil service./nAt the end of 1942, all the Referats were combined into two super Referats or Hauptreferats with the first one being called A for languages  that was directed by Rudolf Bailovic and the second Hauptreferats  B for the mathematical section that was directed by Pietsch.[3]/nAt the end of the war, Pietsch was interned at Civilian Internment Camp No. 6 in Moosburg, along with several of his colleagues, including Johannes Marquart, where he remained until June 1946 without being interrogated about his work.[4] When he left the internment camp, Pietsch returned to work as an editor, gaining employment at the Jahrbuch \u00fcber die Fortschritte der Mathematik and the East German Academy of Sciences in East Germany, and he maintained these positions until he died in 1967.[2]/nAfter the Invasion of Poland, Pietsch, along with another cryptanalyst, Walter Fricke, interviewed a group of captured Polish cryptanalysts to ascertain whether the Polish cryptographic agency had managed to cryptanalyse the Enigma. The subsequent interviews and the whole wartime episode became known as  Case Wicher.[5][6] and rested upon the discovery of a solved Enigma message that had been discovered in the Cryptanalytic Bureau Wicher organisation in Warsaw, Poland in 1939. This was an Enigma message that had been transmitted from a German cruiser in Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War and had been transmitted using the officers cipher.[7]  Pietsch along with Bohm and Steinberg played an important role in conducting security studies into the Enigma that resulted from Case Wicher in the years that followed the discovery of the solved message. Two specific instances of studies leading to action were demonstrated. The first was the discovery that double encipherment of the indicator was a serious insecurity in the use of the Enigma. As a result, on 1 May 1940, nine days before the beginning of the western campaign, in army and air force, the key procedure was radically changed for the Army and Luftwaffe Enigma machines.[8][9] The second in 1944 was when Pietsch recommended that the Enigma daily use should be set below 20000 letters of use a day.[10]", "29763822": "Heliodorus of Larissa (fl. 3rd century?) was a Greek mathematician, and the author of a short treatise on optics which is still extant./nNothing is known about the life of Heliodorus.[1] He was a native of Larissa,[2] and he must have lived after the time of Claudius Ptolemy, whom he quotes.

Much of his work was in the area now known as the \"Zimmer Program\" which aims to understand the actions of semisimple Lie groups and their discrete subgroups on differentiable manifolds.[32]/nCrucial to this program is \"Zimmer's cocycle superrigidity theorem\", a generalization of Grigory Margulis's superrigidity theorem. Like Margulis's work, which greatly influenced Zimmer, it uses ergodic theory as a central technique in the case of invariant measures.[33] It led to many results within the Zimmer Program, although many of the main conjectures remain open.[5] In addition to Margulis, Zimmer was greatly influenced by the work of Mikhail Gromov on rigid transformation groups and he extended and connected Gromov's theory to the Zimmer Program.[32]/nZimmer collaborated with a number of mathematicians to apply the ideas from the Zimmer Program to other areas of mathematics. His collaboration with Alexander Lubotzky applied some of these ideas to arithmetic results on fundamental groups of manifolds.[34] In collaboration with Fran\u00e7ois Labourie and Shahar Mozes, cocycle superrigidity ideas were applied to the basic problem of the existence of compact locally homogeneous spaces of certain types.[35] His collaboration with Amos Nevo concerned actions with stationary measure and provided certain basic structure theorems for such actions of higher rank semisimple groups.[36] Zimmer's earlier work provided a proof of a conjecture of Alain Connes on orbit equivalence of actions of semisimple groups, and introduced the basic notion of amenable group action.[37]/nZimmer was married to Terese Schwartzman, former director of strategic initiatives for the university's Urban Education Institute, but they separated in September 2009 and later divorced.

The concept of multidimensionality is pervasive in mathematics, has come to play a pivotal role in physics, and is a common element in science fiction./nLudwig spent most of his life in Switzerland. He was born in Grasswil (now part of Seeberg), his mother's hometown. The family then moved to the nearby Burgdorf, where his father worked as a tradesman. His father wanted Ludwig to follow in his footsteps, but Ludwig was not cut out for practical work./nIn contrast, because of his mathematical gifts, he was allowed to attend the Gymnasium in Bern in 1829. By that time he was already learning differential calculus from Abraham Gotthelf K\u00e4stner's Mathematische Anfangsgr\u00fcnde der Analysis des Unendlichen (1761). In 1831 he transferred to the Akademie in Bern for further studies. By 1834 the Akademie had become the new Universit\u00e4t Bern, where he started studying theology./nAfter graduating in 1836, he was appointed a secondary school teacher in Thun. He stayed there until 1847, spending his free time studying mathematics and botany while attending the university in Bern once a week./nA turning point in his life came in 1843. Schl\u00e4fli had planned to visit Berlin and become acquainted with its mathematical community, especially Jakob Steiner, a well known Swiss mathematician. But unexpectedly Steiner showed up in Bern and they met. Not only was Steiner impressed by Schl\u00e4fli's mathematical knowledge, he was also very interested in Schl\u00e4fli's fluency in Italian and French./nSteiner proposed Schl\u00e4fli to assist his Berlin colleagues Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, Carl Wilhelm Borchardt and himself as an interpreter on a forthcoming trip to Italy. Steiner sold this idea to his friends in the following way, which indicates Schl\u00e4fli must have been somewhat clumsy at daily affairs:/nEnglish translation:/nSchl\u00e4fli accompanied them to Italy, and benefited much from the trip. They stayed for more than six months, during which time Schl\u00e4fli even translated some of the others' mathematical works into Italian./nSchl\u00e4fli kept up a correspondence with Steiner till 1856. The vistas that had been opened up to him encouraged him to apply for a position at the university in Bern in 1847, where he was appointed(?) in 1848. He stayed until his retirement in 1891, and spent his remaining time studying Sanskrit and translating the Hindu scripture Rig Veda into German, until his death in 1895./nSchl\u00e4fli is one of the three architects of multidimensional geometry, together with Arthur Cayley and Bernhard Riemann. Around 1850 the general concept of Euclidean space had not been developed \u2013 but linear equations in \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n variables were well understood. In the 1840s William Rowan Hamilton had developed his quaternions and John T. Graves and Arthur Cayley the octonions. The latter two systems worked with bases of four and, respectively, eight elements, and suggested an interpretation analogous to the cartesian coordinates in three-dimensional space./nFrom 1850 to 1852 Schl\u00e4fli worked on his magnum opus, Theorie der vielfachen Kontinuit\u00e4t, in which he initiated the study of the linear geometry of \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n-dimensional space. He also defined the \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n-dimensional sphere and calculated its volume. He then wanted to have this work published. It was sent to the Akademie in Vienna, but was refused because of its size. Afterwards it was sent to Berlin, with the same result. After a long bureaucratic pause, Schl\u00e4fli was asked in 1854 to write a shorter version, but he did not do so. Steiner then tried to help him getting the work published in Crelle's Journal, but somehow things didn't work out. The exact reasons remain unknown. Portions of the work were published by Cayley in English in 1860. The first publication of the entire manuscript was only in 1901, after Schl\u00e4fli's death. The first review of the book then appeared in the Dutch mathematical journal Nieuw Archief voor de Wiskunde in 1904, written by the Dutch mathematician Pieter Hendrik Schoute./nDuring this period, Riemann held his famous Habilitationsvortrag \u00dcber die Hypothesen welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen in 1854, and introduced the concept of an \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n-dimensional manifold. The concept of higher-dimensional spaces was starting to flourish./nBelow is an excerpt from the preface to Theorie der vielfachen Kontinuit\u00e4t:/nEnglish translation:/nIt can be seen how he is still thinking of points in \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n-dimensional space as solutions to linear equations, and how he is considering a system without any equations, thus obtaining all possible points of the \n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {R} ^{n}}\n\n, as we would put it now. He disseminated the concept in the articles he published in the 1850s and 1860s, and it matured rapidly. By 1867 he starts an article by saying \"We consider the space of \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n-tuples of points. [...]\". This indicates not only that he had a firm grip on things, but also that his audience did not need a long explanation of it./nIn Theorie der Vielfachen Kontinuit\u00e4t he goes on to define what he calls polyschemes, nowadays called polytopes, which are the higher-dimensional analogues to polygons and polyhedra. He develops their theory and finds, among other things, the higher-dimensional version of Euler's formula. He determines the regular polytopes, i.e. the \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n-dimensional cousins of regular polygons and platonic solids. It turns out there are six in dimension four and three in all higher dimensions./nAlthough Schl\u00e4fli was familiar to his colleagues in the second half of the 19th century, especially for his contributions to complex analysis, his early geometrical work failed to attract notice for many years. At the beginning of the twentieth century Pieter Hendrik Schoute started to work on polytopes together with Alicia Boole Stott. She reproved Schl\u00e4fli's result on regular polytopes for dimension 4 only and afterwards rediscovered his book. Later Willem Abraham Wijthoff studied semi-regular polytopes and this work was continued by H.S.M. Coxeter, John Conway and others. There are still many problems to be solved in this area of investigation opened up by Ludwig Schl\u00e4fli.", "1714552": "Theon of Smyrna (Greek: \u0398\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd \u1f41 \u03a3\u03bc\u03c5\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 Theon ho Smyrnaios, gen. \u0398\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 Theonos; fl. 100 CE) was a Greek philosopher and mathematician, whose works were strongly influenced by the Pythagorean school of thought.

A second work concerning the order in which to study Plato's works has recently been discovered in an Arabic translation.[2]/nHis On Mathematics Useful for the Understanding of Plato is not a commentary on Plato's writings but rather a general handbook for a student of mathematics. It is not so much a groundbreaking work as a reference work of ideas already known at the time. Its status as a compilation of already-established knowledge and its thorough citation of earlier sources is part of what makes it valuable./nThe first part of this work is divided into two parts, the first covering the subjects of numbers and the second dealing with music and harmony. The first section, on mathematics, is most focused on what today is most commonly known as number theory: odd numbers, even numbers, prime numbers, perfect numbers, abundant numbers, and other such properties. It contains an account of 'side and diameter numbers', the Pythagorean method for a sequence of best rational approximations to the square root of 2,[3] the denominators of which are Pell numbers.  It is also one of the sources of our knowledge of the origins of the classical problem of Doubling the cube.[4]/nThe second section, on music, is split into three parts: music of numbers (h\u0113 en arithmois mousik\u0113), instrumental music (h\u0113 en organois mousik\u0113), and \"music of the spheres\" (h\u0113 en kosm\u014d harmonia kai h\u0113 en tout\u014d harmonia). The \"music of numbers\" is a treatment of temperament and harmony using ratios, proportions, and means; the sections on instrumental music concerns itself not with melody but rather with intervals and consonances in the manner of Pythagoras' work. Theon considers intervals by their degree of consonance: that is, by how simple their ratios are. (For example, the octave is first, with the simple 2:1 ratio of the octave to the fundamental.) He also considers them by their distance from one another./nThe third section, on the music of the cosmos, he considered most important, and ordered it so as to come after the necessary background given in the earlier parts. Theon quotes a poem by Alexander of Ephesus assigning specific pitches in the chromatic scale to each planet, an idea that would retain its popularity for a millennium thereafter./nThe second book is on astronomy. Here Theon affirms the spherical shape and large size of the Earth; he also describes the occultations, transits, conjunctions, and eclipses. However, the quality of the work led Otto Neugebauer to criticize him for not fully understanding the material he attempted to present./nTheon was a great philosopher of harmony and he discusses semitones in his treatise. There are several semitones used in Greek music, but of this variety, there are two that are very common. The \u201cdiatonic semitone\u201d with a value of 16/15 and the \u201cchromatic semitone\u201d with a value of 25/24 are the two more commonly used semitones (Papadopoulos, 2002). In these times, Pythagoreans did not rely on irrational numbers for understanding of harmonies and the logarithm for these semitones did not match with their philosophy. Their logarithms did not lead to irrational numbers, however Theon tackled this discussion head on. He acknowledged that \u201cone can prove that\u201d the tone of value 9/8 cannot be divided into equal parts and so it is a number in itself. Many Pythagoreans believed in the existence of irrational numbers, but did not believe in using them because they were unnatural and not positive integers. Theon also does an amazing job of relating quotients of integers and musical intervals. He illustrates this idea in his writings and through experiments. He discusses the Pythagoreans method of looking at harmonies and consonances through half-filling vases and explains these experiments on a deeper level focusing on the fact that the octaves, fifths, and fourths correspond respectively with the fractions 2/1, 3/2, and 4/3. His contributions greatly contributed to the fields of music and physics (Papadopoulos, 2002).", "53258618": "Liu Sifeng (Chinese: \u5218\u601d\u5cf0; born 15 July 1955) is a Chinese systems engineer.

She was educated at Girton College, Cambridge, England and continued her studies at G\u00f6ttingen University in Germany, where in 1895 she received a doctorate.[1] \nHer early writings were published under the name of her husband, William Henry Young, and they collaborated on mathematical work throughout their lives. For her work on calculus (1914\u201316), she was awarded the Gamble Prize for Mathematics by Girton College.[2]/nShe was the youngest of three surviving children. Her father was a senior civil servant, with the title Warden of the Standards in charge of the Weights and Measures Department.[3] The two girls were taught at home by their mother, father and a governess which was the custom for upper-class family during that time. Her family encouraged her to become involved in social work, helping the poor in London. She had aspirations of studying medicine, but her family would not allow this. However, Chisholm wanted to continue her studies. She passed the senior examination for entrance into Cambridge University at the age of 17.[citation needed]/nChisholm entered Girton College in 1889 aged 22, four years after she passed the senior entrance examination having been awarded the Sir Francis Goldsmid Scholarship by the college. At this time the college was only associated with the University of Cambridge with men and women graded on separate but related lists. Although she wanted to study medicine, her mother would not permit this, so, supported by her father, she decided to study mathematics.[3] At the end of her first year, when the Mays list came out, she was top of the Second class immediately below Isabel Maddison. In 1893, Grace passed her final examinations with the equivalent of a first-class degree, ranked between 23 and 24 relative to 112 men.[1][3]/nShe also took (unofficially, on a challenge, with Isabel Maddison) the exam for the Final Honours School in mathematics at the University of Oxford in 1892 in which she out-performed all the Oxford students. As a result, she became the first person to obtain a First class degree at both Oxford and Cambridge Universities in any subject (although they were not awarded formally).[3]/nChisholm remained at Cambridge for an additional year to complete Part II of the Mathematical Tripos, in the hope of being able to follow an academic career.[3]/nShe wanted to continue her studies and since women were not yet admitted to graduate schools in England she went to the University of G\u00f6ttingen in Germany to study with Felix Klein. This was one of the major mathematical centres in the world. She had fortunately already learnt the German language. The decision to admit her had to be approved by the Berlin Ministry of Culture and was part of an experiment in admitting women to university studies.[3] In 1895, at the age of 27, Chisholm was awarded a doctorate in mathematics. Again government approval had to be obtained to allow her to take the examination, which consisted of probing questions by several professors on sections such as geometry, differential equations, physics, astronomy, and the area of her dissertation, all in German. Along with her test she was required to take courses showing broader knowledge as well as prepare a thesis which was entitled Algebraisch-gruppentheoretische Untersuchungen zur sph\u00e4rischen Trigonometrie (Algebraic Groups of Spherical Trigonometry).[4]/nAfter returning to England in 1896 to marry, she resumed research she had initiated at G\u04e7ttingen into an equation to determine the orbit of a comet. Her husband continued his work coaching in mathematics.[3] However, in 1897 they both returned to G\u04e7ttingen, encouraged by Felix Klein. Both attended advanced lectures and while she continued her mathematical research her husband started to work creatively for the first time. They visited Turin in Italy to study modern geometry and under Klein's guidance they began to work in the new area of set theory.[3] From about 1901, the Youngs began to publish papers together. These concerned the theory of functions of a real variable and were heavily influenced by new ideas with which she had come into contact with in G\u04e7ttingen.  In 1908 they moved to Geneva in Switzerland where she continued to be based while her husband held a series of academic posts in India and the UK./nAlthough most of their work was published jointly it is believed that Grace did a large amount of the actual writing, and she also produced some independent work which, according to expert opinion, was deeper and more important than her husband's.[5] In total, they published about 214 papers together,[1] along with four books.[3] She began to publish in her own name in 1914, and was awarded the Gamble Prize for Mathematics by Girton College for an essay On infinite derivates in 1915.[3] This work was stimulated by developments in microscopy that allowed real molecular motion to be viewed. Her work between 1914 and 1916 on relationships between derivatives of an arbitrary function contributed to the Denjoy-Young-Saks theorem./nThey also wrote an elementary geometry book (The First Book of Geometry, 1905) which was translated into 4 languages. In 1906 the Youngs published The Theory of Sets of Points, the first textbook on set theory.[1]/nChisholm married William Henry Young in 1896, the year after she received her PhD from G\u00f6ttingen. He had been her tutor for one term at Cambridge and they had become friends after he was one of the people that she sent a copy of her doctoral thesis.  He suggested collaboration in a publication about astronomy but they did not pursue this.[1] They had six children within nine years./nIn addition to her career as a pioneering woman in what was then a discipline with significant barriers to entry, she completed all the requirements for a medical degree except the internship. She also learned six languages and taught each of her children a musical instrument. In addition, she published two books for children (Bimbo: A Little Real Story for Jill and Molly (1905) and Bimbo and the Frogs: Another Real Story (1907)). The former was aimed to explain where babies came from to children while the latter was about cells.[1] The Young's elementary geometry book (The First Book of Geometry, 1905) was inspired by the education of their son.[6] In 1929 she started a historical novel The Crown of England set in the sixteenth century. She worked on this for five years but it was never published.[3]/nWith the approach of World War II, she left Switzerland in 1940 to take two of her grandchildren to England. She planned to return immediately, but because of the fall of France, she could not. This left William alone, and he died two years later in 1942. Two years after that, Grace Young died of a heart attack.[1]/nOf their six children, three continued on to study mathematics (including Laurence Chisholm Young and Cecilia Rosalind Tanner), one daughter (Janet) became a physician, and one son (Patrick) became a chemist and pursued a career in finance and business. Their eldest son (Frank) was killed in World War I, when his plane was shot down in 1917,[6] and his death had a profound effect on his parents, reducing their mathematical creativity.[3] One of Grace's fourteen grandchildren, Sylvia Wiegand (daughter of Laurence), is a mathematician at the University of Nebraska and is a past president of the Association for Women in Mathematics./nIn 1996 Sylvia Wiegand and her husband Roger established a fellowship for graduate student research at the University of Nebraska in honor of Grace Chisholm Young and William Henry Young, called the Grace Chisholm Young and William Henry Young Award.[7] Sylvia is one of Grace's fourteen grandchildren.", "38971774": "Mariusz Zi\u00f3\u0142ko (born September 18, 1946, in Hamburg) is a Polish Professor of automatics and signal processing.

His father Johann Arnold Lejeune Dirichlet was the postmaster, merchant, and city councilor. His paternal grandfather had come to D\u00fcren from Richelette (or more likely Richelle), a small community 5\u00a0km (3 miles) north east of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium, from which his surname \"Lejeune Dirichlet\" (\"le jeune de Richelette\", French for \"the youth from Richelette\") was derived.[2]/nAlthough his family was not wealthy and he was the youngest of seven children, his parents supported his education. They enrolled him in an elementary school and then private school in hope that he would later become a merchant. The young Dirichlet, who showed a strong interest in mathematics before age 12, persuaded his parents to allow him to continue his studies. In 1817 they sent him to the Gymnasium Bonn\u00a0[de] under the care of Peter Joseph Elvenich, a student his family knew. In 1820, Dirichlet moved to the Jesuit Gymnasium in Cologne, where his lessons with Georg Ohm helped widen his knowledge in mathematics. He left the gymnasium a year later with only a certificate, as his inability to speak fluent Latin prevented him from earning the Abitur.[2]/nDirichlet again persuaded his parents to provide further financial support for his studies in mathematics, against their wish for a career in law. As Germany provided little opportunity to study higher mathematics at the time, with only Gauss at the University of G\u00f6ttingen who was nominally a professor of astronomy and anyway disliked teaching, Dirichlet decided to go to Paris in May 1822. There he attended classes at the Coll\u00e8ge de France and at the University of Paris, learning mathematics from Hachette among others, while undertaking private study of Gauss's Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, a book he kept close for his entire life. In 1823 he was recommended to General Maximilien Foy, who hired him as a private tutor to teach his children German, the wage finally allowing Dirichlet to become independent from his parents' financial support.[3]/nHis first original research, comprising part of a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for the case n\u2009=\u20095, brought him immediate fame, being the first advance in the theorem since Fermat's own proof of the case n\u2009=\u20094 and Euler's proof for n\u2009=\u20093. Adrien-Marie Legendre, one of the referees, soon completed the proof for this case; Dirichlet completed his own proof a short time after Legendre, and a few years later produced a full proof for the case n\u2009=\u200914.[4] In June 1825 he was accepted to lecture on his partial proof for the case n\u2009=\u20095 at the French Academy of Sciences, an exceptional feat for a 20-year-old student with no degree.[2] His lecture at the Academy had also put Dirichlet in close contact with Fourier and Poisson, who raised his interest in theoretical physics, especially Fourier's analytic theory of heat./nAs General Foy died in November 1825 and he could not find any paying position in France, Dirichlet had to return to Prussia. Fourier and Poisson introduced him to Alexander von Humboldt, who had been called to join the court of King Friedrich Wilhelm III. Humboldt, planning to make Berlin a center of science and research, immediately offered his help to Dirichlet, sending letters in his favour to the Prussian government and to the Prussian Academy of Sciences. Humboldt also secured a recommendation letter from Gauss, who upon reading his memoir on Fermat's theorem wrote with an unusual amount of praise that \"Dirichlet showed excellent talent\".[5] With the support of Humboldt and Gauss, Dirichlet was offered a teaching position at the University of Breslau. However, as he had not passed a doctoral dissertation, he submitted his memoir on the Fermat theorem as a thesis to the University of Bonn. Again his lack of fluency in Latin rendered him unable to hold the required public disputation of his thesis; after much discussion, the university decided to bypass the problem by awarding him an honorary doctorate in February 1827. Also, the Minister of Education granted him a dispensation for the Latin disputation required for the Habilitation. Dirichlet earned the Habilitation and lectured in the 1827\u201328 year as a Privatdozent at Breslau.[2]/nWhile in Breslau, Dirichlet continued his number theoretic research, publishing important contributions to the biquadratic reciprocity law which at the time was a focal point of Gauss's research. Alexander von Humboldt took advantage of these new results, which had also drawn enthusiastic praise from Friedrich Bessel, to arrange for him the desired transfer to Berlin. Given Dirichlet's young age (he was 23 years old at the time), Humboldt was able to get him only a trial position at the Prussian Military Academy in Berlin while remaining nominally employed by the University of Breslau. The probation was extended for three years until the position becoming definite in 1831./nAfter Dirichlet's move to Berlin, Humboldt introduced him to the great salons held by the banker Abraham Mendelssohn Bartholdy and his family. Their house was a weekly gathering point for Berlin artists and scientists, including Abraham's children Felix and Fanny Mendelssohn, both outstanding musicians, and the painter Wilhelm Hensel (Fanny's husband). Dirichlet showed great interest in Abraham's daughter Rebecka, whom he married in 1832./nRebecka Henriette Lejeune Dirichlet (n\u00e9e Rebecka  Mendelssohn; 11 April 1811\u00a0\u2013 1 December 1858) was a granddaughter of Moses Mendelssohn and the youngest sister of Felix Mendelssohn and Fanny Mendelssohn.[6][7] Rebecka was born in Hamburg.[8] In 1816 her parents arranged for her to be baptised at which point she took the names Rebecka Henriette Mendelssohn Bartholdy.[9] She became a part of the notable salon of her parents, Abraham Mendelssohn and his wife Lea, having social contacts with the important musicians, artists and scientists in a highly creative period of German intellectual life. In 1829 she sang a small role in the premiere, given at the Mendelssohn house, of Felix's Singspiel Die Heimkehr aus der Fremde. She later wrote:/nMy older brother and sister stole my reputation as an artist. In any other family I would have been highly regarded as a musician and perhaps been leader of a group. Next to Felix and Fanny, I could not aspire to any recognition.[10]/nIn 1832 she married Dirichlet, who was introduced to the Mendelssohn family by Alexander von Humboldt.[11] In 1833 their first son, Walter, was born. She died in G\u00f6ttingen in 1858.[citation needed]/nAs soon as he came to Berlin, Dirichlet applied to lecture at the University of Berlin, and the Education Minister approved the transfer and in 1831 assigned him to the faculty of philosophy. The faculty required him to undertake a renewed habilitation qualification,  and although Dirichlet wrote a Habilitationsschrift as needed, he postponed giving the mandatory lecture in Latin for another 20 years, until 1851. As he had not completed this formal requirement, he remained attached to the faculty with less than full rights, including restricted emoluments, forcing him to keep in parallel his teaching position at the Military School. In 1832 Dirichlet became a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, the youngest member at only 27 years old.[2]/nDirichlet had a good reputation with students for the clarity of his explanations and enjoyed teaching, especially as his University lectures tended to be on the more advanced topics in which he was doing research: number theory (he was the first German professor to give lectures on number theory), analysis and mathematical physics. He advised the doctoral theses of several important German mathematicians, as Gotthold Eisenstein, Leopold Kronecker, Rudolf Lipschitz and Carl Wilhelm Borchardt, while being influential in the mathematical formation of many other scientists, including Elwin Bruno Christoffel, Wilhelm Weber, Eduard Heine, Ludwig von Seidel and Julius Weingarten. At the Military Academy, Dirichlet managed to introduce differential and integral calculus in the curriculum, raising the level of scientific education there. However, he gradually started feeling that his double teaching load, at the Military academy and at the university, was limiting the time available for his research.[2]/nWhile in Berlin, Dirichlet kept in contact with other mathematicians. In 1829, during a trip, he met Carl Jacobi, at the time professor of mathematics at K\u00f6nigsberg University. Over the years they kept meeting and corresponding on research matters, in time becoming close friends. In 1839, during a visit to Paris, Dirichlet met Joseph Liouville, the two mathematicians becoming friends, keeping in contact and even visiting each other with the families a few years later. In 1839, Jacobi sent Dirichlet a paper by Ernst Kummer, at the time a schoolteacher. Realizing Kummer's potential, they helped him get elected in the Berlin Academy and, in 1842, obtained for him a full professor position at the University of Breslau. In 1840 Kummer married Ottilie Mendelssohn, a cousin of Rebecka's./nIn 1843, when Jacobi fell ill, Dirichlet traveled to K\u00f6nigsberg to help him, then obtained for him the assistance of King Friedrich Wilhelm IV's personal physician. When the physician recommended that Jacobi spend some time in Italy, Dirichlet joined him on the trip together with his family. They were accompanied to Italy by Ludwig Schl\u00e4fli, who came as a translator; as he was strongly interested in mathematics, both Dirichlet and Jacobi lectured to him during the trip, and he later became an important mathematician himself.[2] The Dirichlet family extended their stay in Italy to 1845, their daughter Flora being born there. In 1844, Jacobi moved to Berlin as a royal pensioner, their friendship becoming even closer. In 1846, when the Heidelberg University tried to recruit Dirichlet, Jacobi provided von Humboldt the needed support to obtain a doubling of Dirichlet's pay at the university in order to keep him in Berlin; however, even then he was not paid a full professor wage and could not leave the Military Academy.[12]/nHolding liberal views, Dirichlet and his family supported the 1848 revolution; he even guarded with a rifle the palace of the Prince of Prussia. After the revolution failed, the Military Academy closed temporarily, causing him a large loss of income. When it reopened, the environment became more hostile to him, as officers he was teaching were expected to be loyal to the constituted government. Some of the press who had not sided with the revolution pointed him out, as well as Jacobi and other liberal professors, as \"the red contingent of the staff\".[2]/nIn 1849 Dirichlet participated, together with his friend Jacobi, in the jubilee of Gauss's doctorate./nDespite Dirichlet's expertise and the honours he received, and even though, by 1851, he had finally completed all formal requirements for a full professor, the issue of raising his pay at the university still dragged on and he was still unable to leave the Military Academy. In 1855, upon Gauss's death, the University of G\u00f6ttingen decided to call Dirichlet as his successor. Given the difficulties faced in Berlin, he decided to accept the offer and immediately moved to G\u00f6ttingen with his family. Kummer was called to assume his position as a professor of mathematics in Berlin.[3]/nDirichlet enjoyed his time in G\u00f6ttingen, as the lighter teaching load allowed him more time for research and he came into close contact with the new generation of researchers, especially Richard Dedekind and Bernhard Riemann. After moving to G\u00f6ttingen he was able to obtain a small annual stipend for Riemann to retain him in the teaching staff there. Dedekind, Riemann, Moritz Cantor and Alfred Enneper, although they had all already earned their PhDs, attended Dirichlet's classes to study with him. Dedekind, who felt that there were gaps in his mathematics education, considered that the occasion to study with Dirichlet made him \"a new human being\".[2] He later edited and published Dirichlet's lectures and other results in number theory under the title Vorlesungen \u00fcber Zahlentheorie (Lectures on Number Theory)./nIn the summer of 1858, during a trip to Montreux, Dirichlet suffered a heart attack. On 5 May 1859, he died in G\u00f6ttingen, several months after the death of his wife Rebecka.[3] Dirichlet's brain is preserved in the department of physiology at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, along with the brain of Gauss.[dubious  \u2013 discuss] The Academy in Berlin honored him with a formal memorial speech presented by Kummer in 1860, and later ordered the publication of his collected works edited by Kronecker and Lazarus Fuchs./nNumber theory was Dirichlet's main research interest,[13] a field in which he found several deep results and in proving them introduced some fundamental tools, many of which were later named after him. In 1837, Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions, using mathematical analysis concepts to tackle an algebraic problem and thus creating the branch of analytic number theory. In proving the theorem, he introduced the Dirichlet characters and L-functions.[13][14] Also, in the article he noted the difference between the absolute and conditional convergence of series and its impact in what was later called the Riemann series theorem. In 1841, he generalized his arithmetic progressions theorem from integers to the ring of Gaussian integers \n\n\n\n\nZ\n\n[\ni\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} [i]}\n\n.[2]/nIn a couple of papers in 1838 and 1839, he proved the first class number formula, for quadratic forms (later refined by his student Kronecker). The formula, which Jacobi called a result \"touching the utmost of human acumen\", opened the way for similar results regarding more general number fields.[2] Based on his research of the structure of the unit group of quadratic fields, he proved the Dirichlet unit theorem, a fundamental result in algebraic number theory.[14]/nHe first used the pigeonhole principle, a basic counting argument, in the proof of a theorem in diophantine approximation, later named after him Dirichlet's approximation theorem. He published important contributions to Fermat's Last Theorem, for which he proved the cases n\u2009=\u20095 and n\u2009=\u200914, and to the biquadratic reciprocity law.[2] The Dirichlet divisor problem, for which he found the first results, is still an unsolved problem in number theory despite later contributions by other mathematicians./nInspired by the work of his mentor in Paris, Dirichlet published in 1829 a famous memoir giving the conditions, showing for which functions the convergence of the Fourier series holds.[15] Before Dirichlet's solution, not only Fourier, but also Poisson and Cauchy had tried unsuccessfully to find a rigorous proof of convergence. The memoir pointed out Cauchy's mistake and introduced Dirichlet's test for the convergence of series. It also introduced the Dirichlet function as an example of a function that is not integrable (the definite integral was still a developing topic at the time) and, in the proof of the theorem for the Fourier series, introduced the Dirichlet kernel and the Dirichlet integral.[16]/nDirichlet also studied the first boundary value problem, for the Laplace equation, proving the uniqueness of the solution; this type of problem in the theory of partial differential equations was later named the Dirichlet problem after him. A function satisfying a partial differential equation subject to the Dirichlet boundary conditions must have fixed values on the boundary.[13] In the proof he notably used the principle that the solution is the function that minimizes the so-called Dirichlet energy. Riemann later named this approach the Dirichlet principle, although he knew it had also been used by Gauss and by Lord Kelvin.[2]/nWhile trying to gauge the range of functions for which convergence of the Fourier series can be shown, Dirichlet defines a function by the property that \"to any x there corresponds a single finite y\", but then restricts his attention to piecewise continuous functions. Based on this, he is credited with introducing the modern concept for a function, as opposed to the older vague understanding of a function as an analytic formula.[2] Imre Lakatos cites Hermann Hankel as the early origin of this attribution, but disputes the claim saying that \"there is ample evidence that he had no idea of this concept [...] for instance, when he discusses piecewise continuous functions, he says that at points of discontinuity the function has two values\".[17]/nDirichlet also worked in mathematical physics, lecturing and publishing research in potential theory (including the Dirichlet problem and Dirichlet principle mentioned above), the theory of heat and hydrodynamics.[13] He improved on Lagrange's work on conservative systems by showing that the condition for equilibrium is that the potential energy is minimal.[18]/nDirichlet also lectured on probability theory and least squares, introducing some original methods and results, in particular for limit theorems and an improvement of Laplace's method of approximation related to the central limit theorem.[19] The Dirichlet distribution and the Dirichlet process, based on the Dirichlet integral, are named after him./nDirichlet was elected as a member of several academies:[20]/nIn 1855 Dirichlet was awarded the civil class medal of the Pour le M\u00e9rite order at Alexander von Humboldt's recommendation. The Dirichlet crater on the Moon and the 11665 Dirichlet asteroid are named after him.", "43395": "Alfred North Whitehead OM FRS FBA (15 February 1861\u00a0\u2013 30 December 1947) was an English mathematician and philosopher. He created the philosophical school known as process philosophy,[21] which has been applied in a wide variety of disciplines, including ecology, theology, education, physics, biology, economics, and psychology./nIn his early career Whitehead wrote primarily on mathematics, logic, and physics. He wrote the three-volume Principia Mathematica (1910\u20131913), with his former student Bertrand Russell. Principia Mathematica is considered one of the twentieth century's most important works in mathematical logic, and placed 23rd in a list of the top 100 English-language nonfiction books of the twentieth century by Modern Library.[22]/nBeginning in the late 1910s and early 1920s, Whitehead gradually turned his attention from mathematics to philosophy of science, and finally to metaphysics. He developed a comprehensive metaphysical system which radically departed from most of Western philosophy. Whitehead argued that reality consists of processes rather than material objects, and that processes are best defined by their relations with other processes, thus rejecting the theory that reality is fundamentally constructed by bits of matter that exist independently of one another.[23] Whitehead's philosophical works\u00a0\u2013 particularly Process and Reality\u00a0\u2013 are regarded as the foundational texts of process philosophy./nWhitehead's process philosophy argues that \"there is urgency in coming to see the world as a web of interrelated processes of which we are integral parts, so that all of our choices and actions have consequences for the world around us.\"[23] For this reason, one of the most promising applications of Whitehead's thought in recent years has been in the area of ecological civilization and environmental ethics pioneered by John B. Cobb.[24][25]/nAlfred North Whitehead was born in Ramsgate, Kent, England, in 1861.[26] His father, Alfred Whitehead, became an Anglican minister after being headmaster of Chatham House Academy, a school for boys previously headed by Alfred's father, Thomas Whitehead.[27] Whitehead himself recalled both of them as being very successful school masters, with his grandfather being the more \"remarkable\" man.[27]/nWhitehead's mother was Maria Sarah Buckmaster. Her maternal great-grandmother was Jane North (1776-1847), whose maiden surname was given to Whitehead, and several other members of his family over time. His mother, Maria Buckmaster had eleven siblings. The son of her brother Thomas, Walter Selby Buckmaster, was twice an Olympics silver medal winner for Polo (1900, 1908) for Britain, and is said to be \"one of the finest polo players England has ever produced\".[28] Whitehead does not appear to have been close to his mother, although he and Evelyn (full name: Evelyn Ada Maud Rice Willoughby Wade), whom he married in 1890, are recorded in the English Census of 1891 as living with Alfred's mother and father. Lowe notes that there appears to have been mutual dislike between Whitehead's wife, Evelyn, and his mother, Maria./nGriffin relates how Bertrand Russell, a colleague and collaborator of Whitehead, was a very close friend of Whitehead and of his wife, Evelyn. Griffin retells Russell's story of how, one evening in 1901, \"they found Evelyn Whitehead in the middle of what appeared to be a dangerous and acutely painful angina attack. ... [but] It seems that she suffered from a psychosomatic disorder ... [and] the danger was illusory.\" Griffin posits that Russell exaggerated the drama of her illness, and that both Evelyn and Russell were habitually given to melodrama.[29] Intensity of emotion was encourgaged by their avant garde associates in the turbulent Bloomsbury Group which \"discussed aesthetic and philosophical questions in a spirit of agnosticism and were strongly influenced by G.E. Moore's Principia Ethica (1903) and by A. N. Whitehead's and Bertrand Russell's Principia Mathematica (1910\u201313), in the light of which they searched for definitions of the good, the true, and the beautiful\".[30]/nAlfred's brother Henry became Bishop of Madras and wrote the closely observed ethnographic account Village Gods of South-India (Calcutta: Association Press, 1921)./nWhitehead was educated at Sherborne,[31] a prominent English public school, where he excelled in sports and mathematics[32] and was head prefect of his class.[33]/nIn 1880, he began attending Trinity College, Cambridge, and studied mathematics.[34] His academic advisor was Edward Routh.[1] He earned his B.A. from Trinity in 1884, writing his dissertation on James Clerk Maxwell's A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, and graduated as fourth wrangler.[35]/nElected a fellow of Trinity in 1884, Whitehead would teach and write on mathematics and physics at the college until 1910, spending the 1890s writing his Treatise on Universal Algebra (1898), and the 1900s collaborating with his former pupil, Bertrand Russell, on the first edition of Principia Mathematica.[36] He was a Cambridge Apostle.[37]/nIn 1910, Whitehead resigned his senior lectureship in mathematics at Trinity and moved to London without first obtaining another job.[38] After being unemployed for a year, he accepted a position as lecturer in applied mathematics and mechanics at University College London, but was passed over a year later for the Goldsmid Chair of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, a position for which he had hoped to be seriously considered.[39]/nIn 1914, Whitehead accepted a position as professor of applied mathematics at the newly chartered Imperial College London, where his old friend Andrew Forsyth had recently been appointed chief professor of mathematics.[40]/nIn 1918, Whitehead's academic responsibilities began to seriously expand as he accepted a number of high administrative positions within the University of London system, of which Imperial College London was a member at the time. He was elected dean of the Faculty of Science at the University of London in late 1918 (a post he held for four years), a member of the University of London's Senate in 1919, and chairman of the Senate's Academic (leadership) Council in 1920, a post which he held until he departed for America in 1924.[40] Whitehead was able to exert his newfound influence to successfully lobby for a new history of science department, help establish a Bachelor of Science degree (previously only Bachelor of Arts degrees had been offered), and make the school more accessible to less wealthy students.[41]/nToward the end of his time in England, Whitehead turned his attention to philosophy.  Though he had no advanced training in philosophy, his philosophical work soon became highly regarded.  After publishing The Concept of Nature in 1920, he served as president of the Aristotelian Society from 1922 to 1923.[42]/nIn 1924, Henry Osborn Taylor invited the 63-year-old Whitehead to join the faculty at Harvard University as a professor of philosophy.[43] The Whiteheads would spend the rest of their lives in the United States./nDuring his time at Harvard, Whitehead produced his most important philosophical contributions. In 1925, he wrote Science and the Modern World, which was immediately hailed as an alternative to the Cartesian dualism then prevalent in popular science.[44] He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences that same year.[45] He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1926.[46] Lectures from 1927 to 1928, were published in 1929 as a book named Process and Reality, which has been compared to Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.[24]/nIn 1890, Whitehead married Evelyn Wade, an Irishwoman raised in France; they had a daughter, Jessie, and two sons, Thomas and Eric.[33] Thomas followed his father to Harvard in 1931, to teach at the Business School. Eric died in action at the age of 19, while serving in the Royal Flying Corps during World War I.[47]/nFrom 1910, the Whiteheads had a cottage in the village of Lockeridge, near Marlborough, Wiltshire; from there he completed Principia Mathematica.[48][49]/nThe Whiteheads remained in the United States after moving to Harvard in 1924. Alfred retired from Harvard in 1937 and remained in Cambridge, Massachusetts, until his death on 30 December 1947.[50]/nThe two-volume biography of Whitehead by Victor Lowe[51] is the most definitive presentation of the life of Whitehead. However, many details of Whitehead's life remain obscure because he left no Nachlass (personal archive); his family carried out his instructions that all of his papers be destroyed after his death.[52] Additionally, Whitehead was known for his \"almost fanatical belief in the right to privacy,\" and for writing very few personal letters of the kind that would help to gain insight on his life.[52] Wrote Lowe in his preface, \"No professional biographer in his right mind would touch him.\"[26]/nLed by Executive Editor Brian G. Henning and General Editor George R. Lucas Jr., the Whitehead Research Project of the Center for Process Studies is currently working on a critical edition of Whitehead's published and unpublished works.[53] The first volume of the Edinburgh Critical Edition of the Complete Works of Alfred North Whitehead was published in 2017 by Paul A. Bogaard and Jason Bell as The Harvard Lectures of Alfred North Whitehead, 1924\u20131925: The Philosophical Presuppositions of Science.[54]/nIn addition to numerous articles on mathematics, Whitehead wrote three major books on the subject: A Treatise on Universal Algebra (1898), Principia Mathematica (co-written with Bertrand Russell and published in three volumes between 1910 and 1913), and An Introduction to Mathematics (1911).  The former two books were aimed exclusively at professional mathematicians, while the latter book was intended for a larger audience, covering the history of mathematics and its philosophical foundations.[55] Principia Mathematica in particular is regarded as one of the most important works in mathematical logic of the 20th century./nIn addition to his legacy as a co-writer of Principia Mathematica, Whitehead's theory of \"extensive abstraction\" is considered foundational for the branch of ontology and computer science known as \"mereotopology,\" a theory describing spatial relations among wholes, parts, parts of parts, and the boundaries between parts.[56]/nIn A Treatise on Universal Algebra (1898), the term universal algebra had essentially the same meaning that it has today: the study of algebraic structures themselves, rather than examples (\"models\") of algebraic structures.[57] Whitehead credits William Rowan Hamilton and Augustus De Morgan as originators of the subject matter, and James Joseph Sylvester with coining the term itself.[57][58]/nAt the time, structures such as Lie algebras and hyperbolic quaternions drew attention to the need to expand algebraic structures beyond the associatively multiplicative class. In a review Alexander Macfarlane wrote: \"The main idea of the work is not unification of the several methods, nor generalization of ordinary algebra so as to include them, but rather the comparative study of their several structures.\"[59] In a separate review, G.\u00a0B. Mathews wrote, \"It possesses a unity of design which is really remarkable, considering the variety of its themes.\"[60]/nA Treatise on Universal Algebra sought to examine Hermann Grassmann's theory of extension (\"Ausdehnungslehre\"), Boole's algebra of logic, and Hamilton's quaternions (this last number system was to be taken up in Volume II, which was never finished due to Whitehead's work on Principia Mathematica).[61] Whitehead wrote in the preface:/nSuch algebras have an intrinsic value for separate detailed study; also they are worthy of comparative study, for the sake of the light thereby thrown on the general theory of symbolic reasoning, and on algebraic symbolism in particular... The idea of a generalized conception of space has been made prominent, in the belief that the properties and operations involved in it can be made to form a uniform method of interpretation of the various algebras.[62]/nWhitehead, however, had no results of a general nature.[57] His hope of \"form[ing] a uniform method of interpretation of the various algebras\" presumably would have been developed in Volume II, had Whitehead completed it. Further work on the subject was minimal until the early 1930s, when Garrett Birkhoff and \u00d8ystein Ore began publishing on universal algebras.[63]/nPrincipia Mathematica (1910\u20131913) is Whitehead's most famous mathematical work.  Written with former student Bertrand Russell, Principia Mathematica is considered one of the twentieth century's most important works in mathematics, and placed 23rd in a list of the top 100 English-language nonfiction books of the twentieth century by Modern Library.[22]/nPrincipia Mathematica's purpose was to describe a set of axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic from which all mathematical truths could in principle be proven.  Whitehead and Russell were working on such a foundational level of mathematics and logic that it took them until page 86 of Volume II to prove that 1+1=2, a proof humorously accompanied by the comment, \"The above proposition is occasionally useful.\"[64]/nWhitehead and Russell had thought originally that Principia Mathematica would take a year to complete; it ended up taking them ten years.[65] When it came time for publication, the three-volume work was so long (more than 2,000 pages) and its audience so narrow (professional mathematicians) that it was initially published at a loss of 600 pounds, 300 of which was paid by Cambridge University Press, 200 by the Royal Society of London, and 50 apiece by Whitehead and Russell themselves.[65] Despite the initial loss, today there is likely no major academic library in the world which does not hold a copy of Principia Mathematica.[66]/nThe ultimate substantive legacy of Principia Mathematica is mixed.  It is generally accepted that Kurt G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem of 1931 definitively demonstrated that for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics, there would in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced from them, and hence that Principia Mathematica could never achieve its aims.[67] However, G\u00f6del could not have come to this conclusion without Whitehead and Russell's book.  In this way, Principia Mathematica's legacy might be described as its key role in disproving the possibility of achieving its own stated goals.[68] But beyond this somewhat ironic legacy, the book popularized modern mathematical logic and drew important connections between logic, epistemology, and metaphysics.[69]/nUnlike Whitehead's previous two books on mathematics, An Introduction to Mathematics (1911) was not aimed exclusively at professional mathematicians but was intended for a larger audience.  The book covered the nature of mathematics, its unity and internal structure, and its applicability to nature.[55] Whitehead wrote in the opening chapter:/nThe object of the following Chapters is not to teach mathematics, but to enable students from the very beginning of their course to know what the science is about, and why it is necessarily the foundation of exact thought as applied to natural phenomena.[70]/nThe book can be seen as an attempt to understand the growth in unity and interconnection of mathematics as a whole, as well as an examination of the mutual influence of mathematics and philosophy, language, and physics.[71] Although the book is little-read, in some ways it prefigures certain points of Whitehead's later work in philosophy and metaphysics.[72]/nWhitehead showed a deep concern for educational reform at all levels.  In addition to his numerous individually written works on the subject, Whitehead was appointed by Britain's Prime Minister David Lloyd George as part of a 20-person committee to investigate the educational systems and practices of the UK in 1921 and recommend reform.[73]/nWhitehead's most complete work on education is the 1929 book The Aims of Education and Other Essays, which collected numerous essays and addresses by Whitehead on the subject published between 1912 and 1927.  The essay from which Aims of Education derived its name was delivered as an address in 1916 when Whitehead was president of the London Branch of the Mathematical Association.  In it, he cautioned against the teaching of what he called \"inert ideas\" \u2013 ideas that are disconnected scraps of information, with no application to real life or culture.  He opined that \"education with inert ideas is not only useless: it is, above all things, harmful.\"[74]/nRather than teach small parts of a large number of subjects, Whitehead advocated teaching a relatively few important concepts that the student could organically link to many different areas of knowledge, discovering their application in actual life.[75] For Whitehead, education should be the exact opposite of the multidisciplinary, value-free school model[74][76] \u2013 it should be transdisciplinary, and laden with values and general principles that provide students with a bedrock of wisdom and help them to make connections between areas of knowledge that are usually regarded as separate./nIn order to make this sort of teaching a reality, however, Whitehead pointed to the need to minimize the importance of (or radically alter) standard examinations for school entrance.  Whitehead writes:/nEvery school is bound on pain of extinction to train its boys for a small set of definite examinations. No headmaster has a free hand to develop his general education or his specialist studies in accordance with the opportunities of his school, which are created by its staff, its environment, its class of boys, and its endowments. I suggest that no system of external tests which aims primarily at examining individual scholars can result in anything but educational waste.[77]/nWhitehead argued that curriculum should be developed specifically for its own students by its own staff, or else risk total stagnation, interrupted only by occasional movements from one group of inert ideas to another./nAbove all else in his educational writings, Whitehead emphasized the importance of imagination and the free play of ideas.  In his essay \"Universities and Their Function\", Whitehead writes provocatively on imagination:/nImagination is not to be divorced from the facts: it is a way of illuminating the facts.  It works by eliciting the general principles which apply to the facts, as they exist, and then by an intellectual survey of alternative possibilities which are consistent with those principles.  It enables men to construct an intellectual vision of a new world.[78]/nWhitehead's philosophy of education might adequately be summarized in his statement that \"knowledge does not keep any better than fish.\"[79] In other words, bits of disconnected knowledge are meaningless; all knowledge must find some imaginative application to the students' own lives, or else it becomes so much useless trivia, and the students themselves become good at parroting facts but not thinking for themselves./nWhitehead did not begin his career as a philosopher.[26] In fact, he never had any formal training in philosophy beyond his undergraduate education.  Early in his life, he showed great interest in and respect for philosophy and metaphysics, but it is evident that he considered himself a rank amateur.  In one letter to his friend and former student Bertrand Russell, after discussing whether science aimed to be explanatory or merely descriptive, he wrote: \"This further question lands us in the ocean of metaphysic, onto which my profound ignorance of that science forbids me to enter.\"[81] Ironically, in later life, Whitehead would become one of the 20th century's foremost metaphysicians./nHowever, interest in metaphysics \u2013 the philosophical investigation of the nature of the universe and existence \u2013 had become unfashionable by the time Whitehead began writing in earnest about it in the 1920s.  The ever-more impressive accomplishments of empirical science had led to a general consensus in academia that the development of comprehensive metaphysical systems was a waste of time because they were not subject to empirical testing.[82]/nWhitehead was unimpressed by this objection.  In the notes of one of his students for a 1927 class, Whitehead was quoted as saying: \"Every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics.  What he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized.\"[83] In Whitehead's view, scientists and philosophers make metaphysical assumptions about how the universe works all the time, but such assumptions are not easily seen precisely because they remain unexamined and unquestioned.  While Whitehead acknowledged that \"philosophers can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical first principles,\"[84] he argued that people need to continually reimagine their basic assumptions about how the universe works if philosophy and science are to make any real progress, even if that progress remains permanently asymptotic.  For this reason, Whitehead regarded metaphysical investigations as essential to both good science and good philosophy.[85]/nPerhaps foremost among what Whitehead considered faulty metaphysical assumptions was the Cartesian idea that reality is fundamentally constructed of bits of matter that exist totally independently of one another, which he rejected in favour of an event-based or \"process\" ontology in which events are primary and are fundamentally interrelated and dependent on one another.[86] He also argued that the most basic elements of reality can all be regarded as experiential, indeed that everything is constituted by its experience. He used the term \"experience\" very broadly so that even inanimate processes such as electron collisions are said to manifest some degree of experience. In this, he went against Descartes' separation of two different kinds of real existence, either exclusively material or else exclusively mental.[87] Whitehead referred to his metaphysical system as \"philosophy of organism,\" but it would become known more widely as \"process philosophy.\"[87]/nWhitehead's philosophy was highly original, and soon garnered interest in philosophical circles.  After publishing The Concept of Nature in 1920, he served as president of the Aristotelian Society from 1922 to 1923, and Henri Bergson was quoted as saying that Whitehead was \"the best philosopher writing in English.\"[88] So impressive and different was Whitehead's philosophy that in 1924 he was invited to join the faculty at Harvard University as a professor of philosophy at 63 years of age.[43]/nThis is not to say that Whitehead's thought was widely accepted or even well understood.  His philosophical work is generally considered to be among the most difficult to understand in all of the Western canon.[24] Even professional philosophers struggled to follow Whitehead's writings.  One famous story illustrating the level of difficulty of Whitehead's philosophy centres around the delivery of Whitehead's Gifford lectures in 1927\u201328 \u2013 following Arthur Eddington's lectures of the year previous \u2013 which Whitehead would later publish as Process and Reality:/nEddington was a marvellous popular lecturer who had enthralled an audience of 600 for his entire course.  The same audience turned up to Whitehead's first lecture but it was completely unintelligible, not merely to the world at large but to the elect.  My father remarked to me afterwards that if he had not known Whitehead well he would have suspected that it was an imposter making it up as he went along... The audience at subsequent lectures was only about half a dozen in all.[90]/nIt may not be inappropriate to speculate that some fair portion of the respect generally shown to Whitehead by his philosophical peers at the time arose from their sheer bafflement. The Chicago theologian Shailer Mathews once remarked of Whitehead's 1926 book Religion in the Making: \"It is infuriating, and I must say embarrassing as well, to read page after page of relatively familiar words without understanding a single sentence.\"[91]/nHowever, Mathews' frustration with Whitehead's books did not negatively affect his interest.  In fact, there were numerous philosophers and theologians at Chicago's Divinity School that perceived the importance of what Whitehead was doing without fully grasping all of the details and implications.  In 1927, they invited one of America's only Whitehead experts, Henry Nelson Wieman, to Chicago to give a lecture explaining Whitehead's thoughts.[91] Wieman's lecture was so brilliant that he was promptly hired to the faculty and taught there for twenty years, and for at least thirty years afterwards Chicago's Divinity School was closely associated with Whitehead's thought.[89]/nShortly after Whitehead's book Process and Reality appeared in 1929, Wieman famously wrote in his 1930 review:/nNot many people will read Whitehead's recent book in this generation; not many will read it in any generation. But its influence will radiate through concentric circles of popularization until the common man will think and work in the light of it, not knowing whence the light came. After a few decades of discussion and analysis, one will be able to understand it more readily than can now be done.[92]/nWieman's words proved prophetic.  Though Process and Reality has been called \"arguably the most impressive single metaphysical text of the twentieth century,\"[93] it has been little-read and little-understood, partly because it demands \u2013 as Isabelle Stengers puts it \u2013 \"that its readers accept the adventure of the questions that will separate them from every consensus.\"[94] Whitehead questioned Western philosophy's most dearly held assumptions about how the universe works \u2014 but in doing so, he managed to anticipate a number of 21st century scientific and philosophical problems and provide novel solutions.[95]/nWhitehead was convinced that the scientific notion of matter was misleading as a way of describing the ultimate nature of things.  In his 1925 book Science and the Modern World, he wrote that:/nThere persists ... [a] fixed scientific cosmology which presupposes the ultimate fact of an irreducible brute matter, or material, spread through space in a flux of configurations. In itself, such a material is senseless, valueless, purposeless. It just does what it does do, following a fixed routine imposed by external relations which do not spring from the nature of its being.  It is this assumption that I call \"scientific materialism.\" Also, it is an assumption which I shall challenge as being entirely unsuited to the scientific situation at which we have now arrived.[86]/nIn Whitehead's view, there are a number of problems with this notion of \"irreducible brute matter.\" First, it obscures and minimizes the importance of change.  By thinking of any material thing (like a rock, or a person) as being fundamentally the same thing throughout time, with any changes to it being secondary to its \"nature,\" scientific materialism hides the fact that nothing ever stays the same.  For Whitehead, change is fundamental and inescapable; he emphasizes that \"all things flow.\"[96]/nIn Whitehead's view, then, concepts such as \"quality,\" \"matter,\" and \"form\" are problematic. These \"classical\" concepts fail to adequately account for change, and overlook the active and experiential nature of the most basic elements of the world. They are useful abstractions but are not the world's basic building blocks.[97] What is ordinarily conceived of as a single person, for instance, is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping events.[98] After all, people change all the time, if only because they have aged by another second and had some further experience.  These occasions of experience are logically distinct but are progressively connected in what Whitehead calls a \"society\" of events.[99] By assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe, materialists have mistaken the abstract for the concrete (what Whitehead calls the \"fallacy of misplaced concreteness\").[87][100]/nTo put it another way, a thing or person is often seen as having a \"defining essence\" or a \"core identity\" that is unchanging, and describes what the thing or person really is. In this way of thinking, things and people are seen as fundamentally the same through time, with any changes being qualitative and secondary to their core identity (e.g., \"Mark's hair has turned grey as he has gotten older, but he is still the same person\"). But in Whitehead's cosmology, the only fundamentally existent things are discrete \"occasions of experience\" that overlap one another in time and space, and jointly make up the enduring person or thing. On the other hand, what ordinary thinking often regards as \"the essence of a thing\" or \"the identity/core of a person\" is an abstract generalization of what is regarded as that person or thing's most important or salient features across time.  Identities do not define people; people define identities.  Everything changes from moment to moment and to think of anything as having an \"enduring essence\" misses the fact that \"all things flow,\" though it is often a useful way of speaking./nWhitehead pointed to the limitations of language as one of the main culprits in maintaining a materialistic way of thinking and acknowledged that it may be difficult to ever wholly move past such ideas in everyday speech.[101] After all, every moment of each person's life can hardly be given a different proper name, and it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things, rather than constantly keeping in mind that each thing is a different thing from what it was a moment ago.  Yet the limitations of everyday living and everyday speech should not prevent people from realizing that \"material substances\" or \"essences\" are a convenient generalized description of a continuum of particular, concrete processes.  No one questions that a ten-year-old person is quite different by the time he or she turns thirty years old, and in many ways is not the same person at all; Whitehead points out that it is not philosophically or ontologically sound to think that a person is the same from one second to the next./nA second problem with materialism is that it obscures the importance of relations.  It sees every object as distinct and discrete from all other objects.  Each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only externally related to other things.  The idea of matter as primary makes people think of objects as being fundamentally separate in time and space, and not necessarily related to anything.  But in Whitehead's view, relations take a primary role, perhaps even more important than the relata themselves.[102] A student taking notes in one of Whitehead's fall 1924 classes wrote that, \"Reality applies to connections, and only relatively to the things connected. (A) is real for (B), and (B) is real for (A), but [they are] not absolutely real independent of each other.\"[103] In fact, Whitehead describes any entity as in some sense nothing more and nothing less than the sum of its relations to other entities \u2013 its synthesis of and reaction to the world around it.[104] A real thing is just that which forces the rest of the universe to in some way conform to it; that is to say, if theoretically, a thing made strictly no difference to any other entity (i.e., it was not related to any other entity), it could not be said to really exist.[105] Relations are not secondary to what a thing is; they are what the thing is./nIt must be emphasized,[why?] however, that an entity is not merely a sum of its relations, but also a valuation of them and reaction to them.[106] For Whitehead, creativity is the absolute principle of existence, and every entity (whether it is a human being, a tree, or an electron) has some degree of novelty in how it responds to other entities and is not fully determined by causal or mechanistic laws.[107] Most entities do not have consciousness.[108] As a human being's actions cannot always be predicted, the same can be said of where a tree's roots will grow, or how an electron will move, or whether it will rain tomorrow.  Moreover, the inability to predict an electron's movement (for instance) is not due to faulty understanding or inadequate technology; rather, the fundamental creativity/freedom of all entities means that there will always remain phenomena that are unpredictable.[109]/nThe other side of creativity/freedom as the absolute principle is that every entity is constrained by the social structure of existence (i.e., its relations); each actual entity must conform to the settled conditions of the world around it.[105] Freedom always exists within limits.  But an entity's uniqueness and individuality arise from its own self-determination as to just how it will take account of the world within the limits that have been set for it.[110]/nIn summary, Whitehead rejects the idea of separate and unchanging bits of matter as the most basic building blocks of reality, in favour of the idea of reality as interrelated events in the process.  He conceives of reality as composed of processes of dynamic \"becoming\" rather than static \"being,\" emphasizing that all physical things change and evolve and that changeless \"essences\" such as matter are mere abstractions from the interrelated events that are the final real things that make up the world.[87]/nSince Whitehead's metaphysics described a universe in which all entities experience, he needed a new way of describing perception that was not limited to living, self-conscious beings.  The term he coined was \"prehension,\" which comes from the Latin prehensio, meaning \"to seize\".[111] The term is meant to indicate a kind of perception that can be conscious or unconscious, applying to people as well as electrons.  It is also intended to make clear Whitehead's rejection of the theory of representative perception, in which the mind only has private ideas about other entities.[111] For Whitehead, the term \"prehension\" indicates that the perceiver actually incorporates aspects of the perceived thing into itself.[111] In this way, entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations, rather than being independent of them.  Further, Whitehead regards perception as occurring in two modes, causal efficacy (or \"physical prehension\") and presentational immediacy (or \"conceptual prehension\").[108]/nWhitehead describes causal efficacy as \"the experience dominating the primitive living organisms, which have a sense for the fate from which they have emerged, and the fate towards which they go.\"[112] It is, in other words, the sense of causal relations between entities, a feeling of being influenced and affected by the surrounding environment, unmediated by the senses.  Presentational immediacy, on the other hand, is what is usually referred to as \"pure sense perception,\" unmediated by any causal or symbolic interpretation, even unconscious interpretation.  In other words, it is pure appearance, which may or may not be delusive (e.g., mistaking an image in a mirror for \"the real thing\").[113]/nIn higher organisms (like people), these two modes of perception combine into what Whitehead terms \"symbolic reference,\" which links appearance with causation in a process that is so automatic that both people and animals have difficulty refraining from it.  By way of illustration, Whitehead uses the example of a person's encounter with a chair.  An ordinary person looks up, sees a coloured shape, and immediately infers that it is a chair.  However, an artist, Whitehead supposes, \"might not have jumped to the notion of a chair,\" but instead \"might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful colour and a beautiful shape.\"[114] This is not the normal human reaction; most people place objects in categories by habit and instinct, without even thinking about it.  Moreover, animals do the same thing.  Using the same example, Whitehead points out that a dog \"would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such.\"[115] In this way, symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions on the one hand and causal relations on the other, and that it is in fact the causal relationships that dominate the more basic mentality (as the dog illustrates), while it is the sense perceptions which indicate a higher grade mentality (as the artist illustrates).[116]/nWhitehead believed that when asking questions about the basic facts of existence, questions about value and purpose can never be fully escaped.  This is borne out in his thoughts on abiogenesis, or the hypothetical natural process by which life arises from simple organic compounds./nWhitehead makes the startling observation that \"life is comparatively deficient in survival value.\"[117] If humans can only exist for about a hundred years, and rocks for eight hundred million, then one is forced to ask why complex organisms ever evolved in the first place; as Whitehead humorously notes, \"they certainly did not appear because they were better at that game than the rocks around them.\"[118] He then observes that the mark of higher forms of life is that they are actively engaged in modifying their environment, an activity which he theorizes is directed toward the three-fold goal of living, living well, and living better.[119] In other words, Whitehead sees life as directed toward the purpose of increasing its own satisfaction.  Without such a goal, he sees the rise of life as totally unintelligible./nFor Whitehead, there is no such thing as wholly inert matter.  Instead, all things have some measure of freedom or creativity, however small, which allows them to be at least partly self-directed. The process philosopher David Ray Griffin coined the term \"panexperientialism\" (the idea that all entities experience) to describe Whitehead's view, and to distinguish it from panpsychism (the idea that all matter has consciousness).[120]/nWhitehead's idea of God differs from traditional monotheistic notions.[121] Perhaps his most famous and pointed criticism of the Christian conception of God is that \"the Church gave unto God the attributes which belonged exclusively to Caesar.\"[122] Here, Whitehead is criticizing Christianity for defining God as primarily a divine king who imposes his will on the world, and whose most important attribute is power. As opposed to the most widely accepted forms of Christianity, Whitehead emphasized an idea of God that he called \"the brief Galilean vision of humility\":/nIt does not emphasize the ruling Caesar, or the ruthless moralist, or the unmoved mover. It dwells upon the tender elements in the world, which slowly and in quietness operates by love; and it finds purpose in the present immediacy of a kingdom not of this world. Love neither rules, nor is it unmoved; also it is a little oblivious as to morals. It does not look to the future; for it finds its own reward in the immediate present.[123]/nFor Whitehead, God is not necessarily tied to religion.[124] Rather than springing primarily from religious faith, Whitehead saw God as necessary for his metaphysical system.[124] His system required that an order exist among possibilities, an order that allowed for novelty in the world and provided an aim to all entities. Whitehead posited that these ordered potentials exist in what he called the primordial nature of God. However, Whitehead was also interested in religious experience. This led him to reflect more intensively on what he saw as the second nature of God, the consequent nature. Whitehead's conception of God as a \"dipolar\"[125] entity has called for fresh theological thinking./nThe primordial nature he described as \"the unlimited conceptual realization of the absolute wealth of potentiality\"[123] \u2014 i.e., the unlimited possibility of the universe.  This primordial nature is eternal and unchanging, providing entities in the universe with possibilities for realization.  Whitehead also calls this primordial aspect \"the lure for feeling, the eternal urge of desire,\"[126] pulling the entities in the universe toward as-yet unrealized possibilities./nGod's consequent nature, on the other hand, is anything but unchanging; it is God's reception of the world's activity.  As Whitehead puts it, \"[God] saves the world as it passes into the immediacy of his own life.  It is the judgment of a tenderness which loses nothing that can be saved.\"[127] In other words, God saves and cherishes all experiences forever, and those experiences go on to change the way God interacts with the world.  In this way, God is really changed by what happens in the world and the wider universe, lending the actions of finite creatures an eternal significance./nWhitehead thus sees God and the world as fulfilling one another. He sees entities in the world as fluent and changing things that yearn for a permanence which only God can provide by taking them into God's self, thereafter changing God and affecting the rest of the universe throughout time.  On the other hand, he sees God as permanent but as deficient in actuality and change: alone, God is merely eternally unrealized possibilities and requires the world to actualize them.  God gives creatures permanence, while the creatures give God actuality and change.  Here it is worthwhile to quote Whitehead at length:/n\"In this way God is completed by the individual, fluent satisfactions of finite fact, and the temporal occasions are completed by their everlasting union with their transformed selves, purged into conformation with the eternal order which is the final absolute 'wisdom.'  The final summary can only be expressed in terms of a group of antitheses, whose apparent self-contradictions depend on neglect of the diverse categories of existence. In each antithesis there is a shift of meaning which converts the opposition into a contrast./n\"It is as true to say that God is permanent and the World fluent, as that the World is permanent and God is fluent./n\"It is as true to say that God is one and the World many, as that the World is one and God many./n\"It is as true to say that, in comparison with the World, God is actual eminently, as that, in comparison with God, the World is actual eminently./n\"It is as true to say that the World is immanent in God, as that God is immanent in the World./n\"It is as true to say that God transcends the World, as that the World transcends God./n\"It is as true to say that God creates the World, as that the World creates God.../n\"What is done in the world is transformed into a reality in heaven, and the reality in heaven passes back into the world... In this sense, God is the great companion \u2013 the fellow-sufferer who understands.\"[128]/nThe above is some of Whitehead's most evocative writing about God, and was powerful enough to inspire the movement known as process theology, a vibrant theological school of thought that continues to thrive today.[129][130]/nFor Whitehead, the core of religion was individual.  While he acknowledged that individuals cannot ever be fully separated from their society, he argued that life is an internal fact for its own sake before it is an external fact relating to others.[131] His most famous remark on religion is that \"religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness ... and if you are never solitary, you are never religious.\"[132] Whitehead saw religion as a system of general truths that transformed a person's character.[133] He took special care to note that while religion is often a good influence, it is not necessarily good \u2013 an idea which he called a \"dangerous delusion\" (e.g., a religion might encourage the violent extermination of a rival religion's adherents).[134]/nHowever, while Whitehead saw religion as beginning in solitariness, he also saw religion as necessarily expanding beyond the individual.  In keeping with his process metaphysics in which relations are primary, he wrote that religion necessitates the realization of \"the value of the objective world which is a community derivative from the interrelations of its component individuals.\"[135] In other words, the universe is a community which makes itself whole through the relatedness of each individual entity to all the others; meaning and value do not exist for the individual alone, but only in the context of the universal community.  Whitehead writes further that each entity \"can find no such value till it has merged its individual claim with that of the objective universe.  Religion is world loyalty.  The spirit at once surrenders itself to this universal claim and appropriates it for itself.\"[136] In this way, the individual and universal/social aspects of religion are mutually dependent. \nA connection between the works of William DeWitt Hyde and Whitehead further elucidates this necessary duality of social and individual roles in religious experience.[137]\nWhitehead also described religion more technically as \"an ultimate craving to infuse into the insistent particularity of emotion that non-temporal generality which primarily belongs to conceptual thought alone.\"[138] In other words, religion takes deeply felt emotions and contextualizes them within a system of general truths about the world, helping people to identify their wider meaning and significance.  For Whitehead, religion served as a kind of bridge between philosophy and the emotions and purposes of a particular society.[139] It is the task of religion to make philosophy applicable to the everyday lives of ordinary people./nIsabelle Stengers wrote that \"Whiteheadians are recruited among both philosophers and theologians, and the palette has been enriched by practitioners from the most diverse horizons, from ecology to feminism, practices that unite political struggle and spirituality with the sciences of education.\"[94] In recent decades, attention to Whitehead's work has become more widespread, with interest extending to intellectuals in Europe and China, and coming from such diverse fields as ecology, physics, biology, education, economics, and psychology.  One of the first theologians to attempt to interact with Whitehead's thought was the future Archbishop of Canterbury, William Temple. In Temple's Gifford Lectures of 1932-1934 (subsequently published as \"Nature, Man and God\"), Whitehead is one of a number of philosophers of the emergent evolution approach with which Temple interacts.[140] However, it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that Whitehead's thought drew much attention outside of a small group of philosophers and theologians, primarily Americans, and even today he is not considered especially influential outside of relatively specialized circles./nEarly followers of Whitehead were found primarily at the University of Chicago Divinity School, where Henry Nelson Wieman initiated an interest in Whitehead's work that would last for about thirty years.[89] Professors such as Wieman, Charles Hartshorne, Bernard Loomer, Bernard Meland, and Daniel Day Williams made Whitehead's philosophy arguably the most important intellectual thread running through the divinity school.[141] They taught generations of Whitehead scholars, the most notable of whom is John B. Cobb./nAlthough interest in Whitehead has since faded at Chicago's divinity school, Cobb effectively grabbed the torch and planted it firmly in Claremont, California, where he began teaching at Claremont School of Theology in 1958 and founded the Center for Process Studies with David Ray Griffin in 1973.[142] Largely due to Cobb's influence, today Claremont remains strongly identified with Whitehead's process thought.[143][144]/nBut while Claremont remains the most concentrated hub of Whiteheadian activity, the place where Whitehead's thought currently seems to be growing the most quickly is in China.  In order to address the challenges of modernization and industrialization, China has begun to blend traditions of Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism with Whitehead's \"constructive post-modern\" philosophy in order to create an \"ecological civilization\".[76] To date, the Chinese government has encouraged the building of twenty-three university-based centres for the study of Whitehead's philosophy,[76][145] and books by process philosophers John Cobb and David Ray Griffin are becoming required reading for Chinese graduate students.[76] Cobb has attributed China's interest in process philosophy partly to Whitehead's stress on the mutual interdependence of humanity and nature, as well as his emphasis on an educational system that includes the teaching of values rather than simply bare facts.[76]/nOverall, however, Whitehead's influence is very difficult to characterize.  In English-speaking countries, his primary works are little-studied outside of Claremont and a select number of liberal graduate-level theology and philosophy programs.  Outside of these circles, his influence is relatively small and diffuse and has tended to come chiefly through the work of his students and admirers rather than Whitehead himself.[146] For instance, Whitehead was a teacher and long-time friend and collaborator of Bertrand Russell, and he also taught and supervised the dissertation of Willard Van Orman Quine,[147] both of whom are important figures in analytic philosophy \u2013 the dominant strain of philosophy in English-speaking countries in the 20th century.[148] Whitehead has also had high-profile admirers in the continental tradition, such as French post-structuralist philosopher Gilles Deleuze, who once dryly remarked of Whitehead that \"he stands provisionally as the last great Anglo-American philosopher before Wittgenstein's disciples spread their misty confusion, sufficiency, and terror.\"[149] French sociologist and anthropologist Bruno Latour even went so far as to call Whitehead \"the greatest philosopher of the 20th century.\"[150]/nDeleuze's and Latour's opinions, however, are minority ones, as Whitehead has not been recognized as particularly influential within the most dominant philosophical schools.[151] It is impossible to say exactly why Whitehead's influence has not been more widespread, but it may be partly due to his metaphysical ideas seeming somewhat counterintuitive (such as his assertion that matter is an abstraction), or his inclusion of theistic elements in his philosophy,[152] or the perception of metaphysics itself as pass\u00e9, or simply the sheer difficulty and density of his prose.[24]/nHistorically, Whitehead's work has been most influential in the field of American progressive theology.[129][144] The most important early proponent of Whitehead's thought in a theological context was Charles Hartshorne, who spent a semester at Harvard as Whitehead's teaching assistant in 1925, and is widely credited with developing Whitehead's process philosophy into a full-blown process theology.[153] Other notable process theologians include John B. Cobb, David Ray Griffin, Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki, C. Robert Mesle, Roland Faber, and Catherine Keller./nProcess theology typically stresses God's relational nature. Rather than seeing God as impassive or emotionless, process theologians view God as \"the fellow sufferer who understands,\" and as the being who is supremely affected by temporal events.[154] Hartshorne points out that people would not praise a human ruler who was unaffected by either the joys or sorrows of his followers \u2013 so why would this be a praiseworthy quality in God?[155] Instead, as the being who is most affected by the world, God is the being who can most appropriately respond to the world.  However, process theology has been formulated in a wide variety of ways.  C. Robert Mesle, for instance, advocates a \"process naturalism\" \u2014 i.e., a process theology without God.[156]/nIn fact, process theology is difficult to define because process theologians are so diverse and transdisciplinary in their views and interests. John B. Cobb is a process theologian who has also written books on biology and economics. Roland Faber and Catherine Keller integrate Whitehead with poststructuralist, postcolonialist, and feminist theory. Charles Birch was both a theologian and a geneticist. Franklin I. Gamwell writes on theology and political theory. In Syntheism - Creating God in The Internet Age, futurologists Alexander Bard and Jan S\u00f6derqvist repeatedly credit Whitehead for the process theology they see rising out of the participatory culture expected to dominate the digital era./nProcess philosophy is even more difficult to pin down than process theology. In practice, the two fields cannot be neatly separated. The 32-volume State University of New York series in constructive postmodern thought edited by process philosopher and theologian David Ray Griffin displays the range of areas in which different process philosophers work, including physics, ecology, medicine, public policy, nonviolence, politics, and psychology.[157]/nOne philosophical school which has historically had a close relationship with process philosophy is American pragmatism. Whitehead himself thought highly of William James and John Dewey, and acknowledged his indebtedness to them in the preface to Process and Reality.[3] Charles Hartshorne (along with Paul Weiss) edited the collected papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, one of the founders of pragmatism.  Noted neopragmatist Richard Rorty was in turn a student of Hartshorne.[158] Today, Nicholas Rescher is one example of a philosopher who advocates both process philosophy and pragmatism./nIn addition, while they might not properly be called process philosophers, Whitehead has been influential in the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze, Mili\u010d \u010capek, Isabelle Stengers, Bruno Latour, Susanne Langer, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty.[citation needed]/nScientists of the early 20th century for whom Whitehead's work has been influential include physical chemist Ilya Prigogine, biologist Conrad Hal Waddington, and geneticists Charles Birch and Sewall Wright.[18]\nHenry Murray dedicated his \"Explorations in Personality\" to Whitehead, a contemporary at Harvard./nIn physics, Whitehead's theory of gravitation articulated a view that might perhaps be regarded as dual to Albert Einstein's general relativity. It has been severely criticized.[160][161] Yutaka Tanaka suggested that the gravitational constant disagrees with experimental findings, and proposed that Einstein's work does not actually refute Whitehead's formulation.[162] Whitehead's view has now been rendered obsolete, with the discovery of gravitational waves, phenomena observed locally that largely violate the kind of local flatness of space that Whitehead assumes. Consequently, Whitehead's cosmology must be regarded as a local approximation, and his assumption of a uniform spatio-temporal geometry, Minkowskian in particular, as an often-locally-adequate approximation. An exact replacement of Whitehead's cosmology would need to admit a Riemannian geometry. Also, although Whitehead himself gave only secondary consideration to quantum theory, his metaphysics of processes has proved attractive to some physicists in that field. Henry Stapp and David Bohm are among those whose work has been influenced by Whitehead.[159]/nIn the 21st century, Whiteheadian thought is still a stimulating influence: Timothy E. Eastman and Hank Keeton's Physics and Whitehead (2004)[163] and Michael Epperson's Quantum Mechanics and the Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead (2004)[164] and Foundations of Relational Realism: A Topological Approach to Quantum Mechanics and the Philosophy of Nature (2013),[165] aim to offer Whiteheadian approaches to physics. Brian G. Henning, Adam Scarfe, and Dorion Sagan's Beyond Mechanism (2013) and Rupert Sheldrake's Science Set Free (2012) are examples of Whiteheadian approaches to biology./nOne of the most promising applications of Whitehead's thought in recent years has been in the area of ecological civilization, sustainability, and environmental ethics./n\"Because Whitehead's holistic metaphysics of value lends itself so readily to an ecological point of view, many see his work as a promising alternative to the traditional mechanistic worldview, providing a detailed metaphysical picture of a world constituted by a web of interdependent relations.\"[24]/nThis work has been pioneered by John B. Cobb, whose book Is It Too Late? A Theology of Ecology (1971) was the first single-authored book in environmental ethics.[170] Cobb also co-authored a book with leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly entitled For the Common Good: Redirecting the Economy toward Community, the Environment, and a Sustainable Future (1989), which applied Whitehead's thought to economics, and received the Grawemeyer Award for Ideas Improving World Order. Cobb followed this with a second book, Sustaining the Common Good: A Christian Perspective on the Global Economy (1994), which aimed to challenge \"economists' zealous faith in the great god of growth.\"[171]/nWhitehead is widely known for his influence in education theory. His philosophy inspired the formation of the Association for Process Philosophy of Education (APPE), which published eleven volumes of a journal titled Process Papers on process philosophy and education from 1996 to 2008.[172] Whitehead's theories on education also led to the formation of new modes of learning and new models of teaching./nOne such model is the ANISA model developed by Daniel C. Jordan, which sought to address a lack of understanding of the nature of people in current education systems.  As Jordan and Raymond P. Shepard put it: \"Because it has not defined the nature of man, education is in the untenable position of having to devote its energies to the development of curricula without any coherent ideas about the nature of the creature for whom they are intended.\"[173]/nAnother model is the FEELS model developed by Xie Bangxiu and deployed successfully in China. \"FEELS\" stands for five things in curriculum and education: Flexible-goals, Engaged-learner, Embodied-knowledge, Learning-through-interactions, and Supportive-teacher.[174] It is used for understanding and evaluating educational curriculum under the assumption that the purpose of education is to \"help a person become whole.\" This work is in part the product of cooperation between Chinese government organizations and the Institute for the Postmodern Development of China.[76]/nWhitehead's philosophy of education has also found institutional support in Canada, where the University of Saskatchewan created a Process Philosophy Research Unit and sponsored several conferences on process philosophy and education.[175] Howard Woodhouse at the University of Saskatchewan remains a strong proponent of Whiteheadian education.[176]/nThree recent books which further develop Whitehead's philosophy of education include: Modes of Learning: Whitehead's Metaphysics and the Stages of Education (2012) by George Allan; The Adventure of Education: Process Philosophers on Learning, Teaching, and Research (2009) by Adam Scarfe; and \"Educating for an Ecological Civilization: Interdisciplinary, Experiential, and Relational Learning\" (2017) edited by Marcus Ford and Stephen Rowe. \"Beyond the Modern University: Toward a Constructive Postmodern University,\" (2002) is another text that explores the importance of Whitehead's metaphysics for thinking about higher education./nWhitehead has had some influence on philosophy of business administration and organizational theory.  This has led in part to a focus on identifying and investigating the effect of temporal events (as opposed to static things) within organizations through an \"organization studies\" discourse that accommodates a variety of 'weak' and 'strong' process perspectives from a number of philosophers.[177] One of the leading figures having an explicitly Whiteheadian and panexperientialist stance towards management is Mark Dibben,[178] who works in what he calls \"applied process thought\" to articulate a philosophy of management and business administration as part of a wider examination of the social sciences through the lens of process metaphysics. For Dibben, this allows \"a comprehensive exploration of life as perpetually active experiencing, as opposed to occasional \u2013 and thoroughly passive \u2013 happening.\"[179] Dibben has published two books on applied process thought, Applied Process Thought I: Initial Explorations in Theory and Research (2008), and Applied Process Thought II: Following a Trail Ablaze (2009), as well as other papers in this vein in the fields of philosophy of management and business ethics.[180]/nMargaret Stout and Carrie M. Staton have also written recently on the mutual influence of Whitehead and Mary Parker Follett, a pioneer in the fields of organizational theory and organizational behavior.  Stout and Staton see both Whitehead and Follett as sharing an ontology that \"understands becoming as a relational process; difference as being related, yet unique; and the purpose of becoming as harmonizing difference.\"[181] This connection is further analyzed by Stout and Jeannine M. Love in Integrative Process: Follettian Thinking from Ontology to Administration[182]/nWhitehead's political views sometimes appear to be libertarian without the label. He wrote:/nNow the intercourse between individuals and between social groups takes one of two forms, force or persuasion. Commerce is the great example of intercourse by way of persuasion. War, slavery, and governmental compulsion exemplify the reign of force.[183]/nOn the other hand, many Whitehead scholars read his work as providing a philosophical foundation for the social liberalism of the New Liberal movement that was prominent throughout Whitehead's adult life. Morris wrote that \"... there is good reason for claiming that Whitehead shared the social and political ideals of the new liberals.\"[184]/nBooks written by Whitehead, listed by date of publication./nIn addition, the Whitehead Research Project of the Center for Process Studies is currently working on a critical edition of Whitehead's writings, which is set to include notes taken by Whitehead's students during his Harvard classes, correspondence, and corrected editions of his books.[53]/nFor the most comprehensive list of resources related to Whitehead, see the thematic bibliography of the Center for Process Studies./n\u2013 Contains a section called \"Alfred North Whitehead: Toward a More Fundamental Ontology\" that is an overview of Whitehead's metaphysics.", "37890436": "Reza Sadeghi  (Persian: \u0631\u0636\u0627 \u0635\u0627\u062f\u0642\u06cc; April 20, 1977 \u2013 March 17, 1998[1]) was an Iranian mathematician and Olympiad gold and silver medals winner.[2] He is an alumnus of National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents (NODET)./nHe was a graduated of Hasheminejad High School, Mashad.

Mallet also studied privately with Le Sage before leaving Geneva in 1760 to study at the University of Basel, where he was a student of Daniel Bernoulli.[27]\nHe completed his studies in 1762,[28] and journeyed to France and England in 1765, where he became friends with astronomers J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalande, John Bevis, who discovered the Crab Nebula, and Nevil Maskelyne, among others.[4][27] Mallet's first introduction to the science of astronomy came from Lalande and Maskelyne during this trip.[29]/nIn April 1768, upon the recommendation of Lalande and Bernoulli, Mallet was invited to Russia by Catherine the Great and the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences to prepare to observe the 1769 transit of Venus from Ponoy\u00a0[ru], Lapland.[30][31][32][33] He was accompanied by another Genevan astromer, Jean-Louis Pictet, whose own assignment was along the Umba.[30][33] Others who were engaged to observe the transit include Stepan Rumovsky, Christian Mayer,[34] and Christoph Euler,[35] son of the mathematician Leonhard Euler. While in Saint Petersburg, readying themselves for their expedition north, Mallet and Pictet met with many members of high society, including Jean-Baptiste Charpentier and the Baron Stroganov, who, like Mallet, had been a pupil of Necker at the Geneva Academy.[36]/nThe transit of Venus occurred on 3 June 1769. From 76 points globally,[37] astronomers and navigators, like James Cook in Tahiti, were charged with observing the rare phenomenon.[38]\nUnfortunately for Mallet, rain obscured the transit, and he was only able to view its beginning.[14] Despite the weather, he still managed to publish useful data regarding solar parallax, allowing for better estimation of the Earth-Sun distance by him and his colleagues.[39][40] In December 1776, perhaps owing to his contributions in Lapland, Mallet was awarded honorary membership in the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences.[10][41]/nAfter his return from Russia, Mallet was elected by the bourgeoisie to the Council of Two Hundred of Geneva, the canton's legislative authority.[7] In 1771, he accepted an honorary professorship at the Academy of Geneva, acting as lifetime chairperson of the astronomy department.[42] The same year, Mallet convinced his fellow members of the council to approve construction of a permanent observatory on the casemate of the Bastion St-Antoine,[43] provided he settle a portion of the financing himself and supply accurate time calculations to the city watchmakers.[15][29] Although the observatory, Geneva's first, was founded by Mallet in 1772, some sources suggest the project was completed in 1773.[44][45][46]/nFor the structure's design, Mallet had departed from a traditional, utilitarian plan,[NB 1] instead building a single-story octagon, capped with a drum and small dome.[43][47] To furnish the observatory, Mallet purchased and installed a 10-foot achromatic telescope, likely manufactured by the English optician John Dollond, a high-precision clock from the French ma\u00eetre Jean-Andr\u00e9 Lepaute, and a meridian bezel, crafted by Jeremiah Sisson, to better calculate the duration of Earth's rotation for timekeeping.[3][29][49] With his pupils and assistants, including Marc-Auguste Pictet and Jean Trembley, Mallet continued to observe celestial objects and bodies, and their interactions with each other and the Earth.[3] In May 1772, Mallet was appointed as a corresponding member of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalande.[50] As a correspondent, Mallet was seen as effective, meticulous, and dependable.[4]/nIn 1771, after the death of his father, Jacques-Andr\u00e9 became responsible for the family estate located in Avully, a small municipality southwest of Geneva.[46] The property included a ch\u00e2teau, agricultural buildings, and arable land approaching the Rh\u00f4ne to the north and west.[6][51][NB 2] Each year, from about April to November, Mallet relocated to the country, eventually renovating a portion of the chateau's roof to act as his personal observatory.[6] Mallet conducted official research in Avully, as well, with occasional assistance from Pictet and Trembley.[52] In April 1773, having developed an interest in meteorology and crop cultivation, Mallet began a diary, diligently detailing weather patterns, livestock acquisition, sharecropping and labor, equipment maintenance, crop maturation, quality of wine production, and more.[26] His records have provided useful information to historians in their study of the agrarian systems and climate of Geneva in the late 18th century.[53] Mallet continued his diary until January 1789.[54]/nBy January 1787, Mallet's health had deteriorated to such a great extent[NB 3] that he permanently retired to Avully, though he remained in his leadership position at the Geneva Observatory.[4][26] In June of the same year, while passing through Geneva on his continental research expedition with Duke Ernest II, astronomer Franz Xaver von Zach visited Mallet in Avully to socialize and conduct research.[55] Other scientists and intellectuals maintained epistolary communication with Mallet, including Johann Bernoulli, Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Jean Hyacinthe de Magellan, Johann Euler, and Charles Messier.[56][57]/nAfter his death in 1790, his former pupil Marc-Auguste Pictet succeeded Mallet as director of the observatory.[43][58] Mallet's astronomical instruments from Avully were purchased by Pictet and the Geneva Arts Society, an organization founded by another of Pictet's instructors, Saussure, and donated to the Geneva Observatory.[6][19] The Avully estate is currently protected as a regional cultural asset according to the Hague Convention and Swiss federal law.[59]/nJacques-Andr\u00e9 was never married and fathered no known children.[7]\nIn 1773, his youngest sister, Marguerite (1745-1824), married the astronomer and lawyer Jean-Louis Pictet, Jacques-Andr\u00e9's companion during the 1769 expedition to the Kola peninsula.[60] His other sister, Isabelle (1743-1798), continued Jacques-Andr\u00e9's diary and estate accounts for two years after his last entry.[54]\nWhen Isabelle, like her brother, died unmarried, the Avully estate passed to her nephew, Jean-Pierre Pictet, father of the zoologist and paleontologist Francois-Jules Pictet.[26][61]/nIt is generally accepted that the lunar crater Mallet was named after Robert Mallet, the Irish geophysicist and engineer.[62][63] However, since no given name was originally denoted, Swiss astronomer Marcel Golay, eighth director of the Geneva Observatory (1956-1992), suggested that Blagg and M\u00fcller had labelled the eponymous crater in honor of Jacques-Andr\u00e9.[7][64]

He made a hobby of linguistics and was fluent in five languages.[1]", "1452482": "Ferdinand Gotthold Max Eisenstein (16 April 1823 \u2013 11 October 1852) was a German mathematician. He specialized in number theory and analysis, and proved several results that eluded even Gauss. Like Galois and Abel before him, Eisenstein died before the age of 30. He was born and died in Berlin, Prussia./nHis parents, Johann Konstantin Eisenstein and Helene Pollack, were of Jewish descent and converted to Protestantism prior to his birth.[1] From an early age, he demonstrated talent in mathematics and music. As a young child he learned to play piano, and he continued to play and compose for piano throughout his life./nHe suffered various health problems throughout his life, including meningitis as an infant, a disease that took the lives of all five of his brothers and sisters. In 1837, at the age of 14, he enrolled at Friedrich Wilhelm Gymnasium, and soon thereafter at Friedrich Werder Gymnasium in Berlin. His teachers recognized his talents in mathematics, but by 15 years of age he had already learned all the material taught at the school. He then began to study differential calculus from the works of Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange./nAt 17, still a student, Eisenstein began to attend classes given by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and others at the University of Berlin. In 1842, before taking his final exams, he traveled with his mother to England, to search for his father. In 1843 he met William Rowan Hamilton in Dublin, who gave him a copy of his book on Niels Henrik Abel's proof of the impossibility of solving fifth-degree polynomials, a work that would stimulate Eisenstein's interest in mathematical research./nIn 1843 Eisenstein returned to Berlin, where he passed his graduation exams and enrolled in the University the following autumn. In January 1844 he had already presented his first work to the Berlin Academy, on cubic forms in two variables. The same year he met for the first time with Alexander von Humboldt, who would later become Eisenstein's patron. Humboldt managed to find grants from the King, the government of Prussia, and the Berlin academy to compensate for Eisenstein's extreme poverty.[2] The money, always late and grudgingly given, was earned in full measure by Eisenstein: in 1844 alone he published over 23 papers and two problems in Crelle's Journal, including two proofs of the law of quadratic reciprocity, and the analogous laws of cubic reciprocity and quartic reciprocity./nIn June 1844 Eisenstein visited Carl Friedrich Gauss in G\u00f6ttingen. In 1845, Kummer saw to it that he received an honorary doctorate at the University of Breslau. Jacobi also encouraged the distinction, but later relations between Jacobi and Eisenstein were always rocky, due primarily to a disagreement over the order of discoveries made in 1846. In 1847 Eisenstein habilitated at the University of Berlin, and he began to teach there. Bernhard Riemann attended his classes on elliptic functions./nIn 1848 Eisenstein was imprisoned briefly by the Prussian army for his revolutionary activities in Berlin. Eisenstein always had republican sympathies, and while he did not actively participate in the revolution of 1848, he was arrested on 19 March of that year. Although he was released just one day later, the harsh treatment he suffered damaged his already delicate health. But his association with the Republican cause led to his official stipends being revoked, despite Humboldt tenaciously coming to his defense./nDespite his health, Eisenstein continued writing papers on quadratic partitions of prime numbers and the reciprocity laws. In 1851, at the instigation of Gauss, he was elected to the Academy of G\u00f6ttingen; one year later, this time at the recommendation of Dirichlet, he was also elected to the Academy of Berlin./nHe died of tuberculosis at the age of 29. Humboldt, then 83, accompanied his remains to the cemetery. He had recently obtained, too late, as it turned out, the funding necessary to send Eisenstein on holiday to Sicily./nSeit 1847 war er Privatdocent an der Universit\u00e4t zu Breslau, seit dem 24.

Bell in his 1937 book Men of Mathematics (page 237) claims that Gauss said \"There have been but three epoch-making mathematicians, Archimedes, Newton, and Eisenstein\", and this has been widely quoted in writings about Eisenstein. This is not a quote by Gauss, but is (a translation of) the end of a sentence from the biography of Eisenstein by Moritz Cantor\u00a0(1877), one of Gauss's last students and a historian of mathematics, who was summarizing his recollection of a remark made by Gauss about Eisenstein in a conversation many years earlier./nAlthough it is doubtful that Gauss really put Eisenstein in the same league as Newton, his writings show that Gauss thought very highly of Eisenstein.

He argues that quantum wave functions collapse when conscious minds select one among the alternative quantum possibilities. His hypothesis of how mind may interact with matter via quantum processes in the brain differs from that of Penrose and Hameroff. While they postulate quantum computing in the microtubules in brain neurons, Stapp postulates a more global collapse, a 'mind like' wave-function collapse that exploits certain aspects of the quantum Zeno effect within the synapses. Stapp's view of the neural correlate of attention is explained in his book, Mindful Universe: Quantum Mechanics and the Participating Observer (2007). Stapp has claimed that consciousness is fundamental to the universe.[5]/nIn this book he credits John von Neumann's Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics (1955, 1932) with providing an \"orthodox\" quantum mechanics demonstrating mathematically the essential role of quantum physics in the mind.

Such usage is not compatible with standard quantum mechanics because one can attach any number of ghostly minds to any point in space that act upon physical quantum systems with any projection operators. Therefore, Stapp's model does not build upon \"the prevailing principles of physics\", but negates them.[10] (2) Stapp's claim that quantum Zeno effect is robust against environmental decoherence directly contradicts a basic theorem in quantum information theory according to which acting with projection operators upon the density matrix of a quantum system can never decrease the Von Neumann entropy of the system, but can only increase it.[10][11] Stapp has responded to Bourget and Georgiev stating that the allegations of errors are incorrect.[13][14]", "40839653": "Franklin Paul Peterson (1930\u20132000) was an American mathematician specializing in algebraic topology.

His theory was published originally in his dissertation Sur les fonctions de variables r\u00e9elles (\"On the Functions of Real Variables\") in 1899./nThe son of a tailor, Baire was one of three children from a poor working-class family in Paris. He started his studies when he entered the Lyc\u00e9e Lakanal through the use of a scholarship.[1] In 1890, Baire completed his advanced classes and entered the special mathematics section of the Lyc\u00e9e Henri IV. While there, he prepared for and passed the entrance examination for the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure and the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. He decided to attend the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in 1891.[2][3] After receiving his three-year degree, Baire proceeded toward his agr\u00e9gation. He did better than all the other students on the writing portion of the test but he did not pass the oral examination due to a lack of explanation and clarity in his lesson. After retaking the agr\u00e9gation and passing, he was assigned to teach at the secondary school (lyc\u00e9e) in Bar-le-Duc. While there, Baire researched the concept of limits and discontinuity for his doctorate. He presented his thesis on March 24, 1899 and was awarded his doctorate. He continued to teach in secondary schools around France but was not happy teaching lower level mathematics. In 1901 Baire was appointed to the University of Montpellier as a \"Ma\u00eetre de conf\u00e9rences\". In 1904 he was awarded a Peccot Foundation Fellowship to spend a semester in a university and develop his skills as a professor. Baire chose to attend the Coll\u00e8ge de France where he lectured on the subject of analysis. He was appointed to a university post in 1905 when he joined the Faculty of Science at the University of Dijon. In 1907 he was promoted to Professor of Analysis at Dijon where he continued his research in analysis./nSince he was young, Baire always had \"delicate\" health.  He had developed problems with his esophagus before he attended school and he would occasionally experience severe attacks of agoraphobia.[4] From time to time, his health would prevent him from working or studying. The bad spells became more frequent, immobilizing him for long periods of time. Over time, he had developed a kind of psychological disorder that made him unable to undertake work that required long periods of concentration.[2] At times this would make his ability to research mathematics impossible. Between 1909 and 1914 this problem continually plagued him and his teaching duties became more and more difficult.[1] In 1914 he was given a leave of absence from the University of Dijon due to his poor health,[4] after which he spent the rest of his life in Lausanne, Switzerland, and around Lake Geneva.  He retired from Dijon in 1925 and spent his last years living in multiple hotels that he could afford with his meager pension.  He committed suicide in 1932.[2]/nBaire's skill in mathematical analysis led him to study with other major names in analysis such as Vito Volterra and Henri Lebesgue.[4] In his dissertation Sur les fonctions de variable r\u00e9elles (\"On the Functions of Real Variables\"), Baire studied a combination of set theory and analysis topics to arrive at the Baire category theorem and the definition of a nowhere dense set. He then used these topics to prove the theorems of those he studied with and further the understanding of continuity. Among Baire's other most important works are Th\u00e9orie des nombres irrationnels, des limites et de la continuit\u00e9 (Theory of Irrational Numbers, Limits, and Continuity) published in 1905 and both volumes of Le\u00e7ons sur les th\u00e9ories g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de l\u2019analyse (Lessons on the General Theory of Analysis) published in 1907\u201308.[3]", "240174": "Sir Ronald Ross KCB KCMG FRS FRCS[1][2] (13 May 1857 \u2013 16 September 1932) was a British medical doctor who received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1902 for his work on the transmission of malaria, becoming the first British Nobel laureate, and the first born outside Europe. His discovery of the malarial parasite in the gastrointestinal tract of a mosquito in 1897 proved that malaria was transmitted by mosquitoes, and laid the foundation for the method of combating the disease./nRoss was a polymath, writing a number of poems, publishing several novels, and composing songs. He was also an amateur artist and mathematician. He worked in the Indian Medical Service for 25 years. It was during his service that he made the groundbreaking medical discovery. After resigning from his service in India, he joined the faculty of Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, and continued as Professor and Chairman of Tropical Medicine of the institute for 10 years. In 1926, he became Director-in-Chief of the Ross Institute and Hospital for Tropical Diseases, which was established in honour of his works. He remained there until his death.[3][4]/nRoss was born in Almora, then in the North-Western Provinces of Company-ruled India, north west of Nepal.[1] He was the eldest of ten children of Sir Campbell Claye Grant Ross, a general in the British Indian Army, and Matilda Charlotte Elderton. At age eight, he was sent to England to live with his aunt and uncle on the Isle of Wight. He attended Primary schools at Ryde, and for secondary education he was sent to a boarding school at Springhill, near Southampton, in 1869. From his early childhood, he developed a passion for poetry, music, literature and mathematics. At fourteen years of age he won a prize for mathematics, a book titled Orbs of Heaven which sparked his interest in mathematics. In 1873, at sixteen, he secured first position in the Oxford and Cambridge local examination in drawing.[5]/nAlthough Ross wanted to become a writer, his father arranged enrollment at St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College in London, in 1874. Not fully committed, he spent most of his time composing music, and writing poems and plays. He left in 1880. In 1879 he had passed the examinations for the Royal College of Surgeons of England, and he worked as a ship's surgeon on a transatlantic steamship while studying for the licenciate of the Society of Apothecaries.[6] He qualified on second attempt in 1881, and after a four-month training at Army Medical School, was appointed a surgeon in the Indian Medical Service on 5 April 1881, assigned to the Madras Presidency.[7][4] Between June 1888 and May 1889 he took study leave to obtain the Diploma in Public Health from the Royal College of Physicians and Royal College of Surgeons, and took a course in bacteriology under Professor E. E. Klein.[3]/nRoss embarked for India on 22 September 1881 on the troopship Jumma. Between 1881 and 1894 he was variously posted in Madras, Moulmein (in Burma/Myanmar), Baluchistan, Andaman Islands, Bangalore and Secunderabad. In 1883, he was posted as the Acting Garrison Surgeon at Bangalore during which he noticed the possibility of controlling mosquitoes by limiting their access to water. In March 1894 he had his home leave and went to London with his family. On 10 April 1894 he met Sir Patrick Manson for the first time. Manson who became Ross's mentor, introduced him to the real problems in malaria research. Manson always had a firm belief that India was the best place for the study. Ross returned to India on P&O ship Ballaarat on 20 March 1895 and landed in Secunderabad on 24 April.[8] Even before his luggage was cleared in the custom office, he went straight for Bombay Civil Hospital, looking for malarial patients and started making blood films./nRoss made his first important step in May 1895 when he observed the early stages of malarial parasite inside a mosquito stomach. However, his enthusiasm was interrupted as he was deployed to Bangalore to investigate an outbreak of cholera. Bangalore had no regular cases of malaria. He confided to Manson stating, \"I am thrown out of employment and have 'no work to do'.\" But in April he had a chance to visit Sigur Ghat near the hill station of Ooty, where he noticed a mosquito on the wall in a peculiar posture, and for this he called it \"dappled-winged\" mosquito, not knowing the species. In May 1896, he was given a short leave that enabled him to visit a malaria-endemic region around Ooty. In spite of his daily quinine prophylaxis, he was down with severe malaria three days after his arrival. In June he was transferred to Secunderabad.[2][9]/nAfter two years of research failure, in July 1897, Ross managed to culture 20 adult \"brown\" mosquitoes from collected larvae. He successfully infected the mosquitoes from a patient named Husein Khan for a price of 8 annas (one anna per blood-fed mosquito). After blood-feeding, he dissected the mosquitoes. On 20 August he confirmed the presence of the malarial parasite inside the gut of mosquito, which he originally identified as \"dappled-wings\" (which turned out to be species of the genus Anopheles). The next day, on 21 August, he confirmed the growth of the parasite in the mosquito. This discovery was published on 27 August 1897[10] in the Indian Medical Gazette and subsequently in the December 1897 issue of British Medical Journal.[11][12] In the evening he composed the following poem for his discovery (originally unfinished, sent to his wife on 22 August, and completed a few days later):[13][14]/nThis day relenting God\nHath placed within my hand\nA wondrous thing; and God\nBe praised. At His command,\nSeeking His secret deeds\nWith tears and toiling breath,\nI find thy cunning seeds,\nO million-murdering Death.\nI know this little thing\nA myriad men will save.\nO Death, where is thy sting?\nThy victory, O Grave?/nIn September 1897, Ross was transferred to Bombay, from where he was subsequently sent to a malaria-free Kherwara in Rajputana (now Rajasthan). Frustrated of lack of work he threatened to resign from service as he felt that it was a death blow to his pursuit. It was only on the representation of Patrick Manson, that the government arranged for his continued service in Calcutta on a \"special duty\".[3] On 17 February 1898 he arrived in Calcutta (now Kolkata), to work in the Presidency General Hospital (now IPGMER and SSKM Hospital).[9]/nRoss immediately carried out research in malaria and Visceral leishmaniasis (also known as kala azar), for which he was assigned. He was given the use of Surgeon-Lieutenant-General Cunningham's laboratory for his research. He had no success with malarial patients because they were always immediately given medication. He built a bungalow with a laboratory at Mahanad village, where he would stay from time to time to collect mosquitoes in and around the village. He employed Mahomed (or Muhammed) Bux and Purboona (who deserted him after the first payday). As Calcutta was not a malarious place, Manson persuaded him to use birds, as being used by other scientists such as Vasily Danilewsky in Russia and William George MacCallum in America. Ross complied but with a complaint that he \"did not need to be in India to study bird malaria\". By March he began to see results on bird parasites, very closely related to the human malarial parasites.[15]/nUsing more convenient model of birds (infected sparrows), by July 1898 Ross established the importance of culex mosquitoes as intermediate hosts in avian malaria. On 4 July he discovered that the salivary gland was the storage sites of malarial parasites in the mosquito. By 8 July he was convinced that the parasites are released from the salivary gland during biting. He later demonstrated the transmission of malarial parasite from mosquitoes (in this case Culex species) to healthy sparrows from an infected one, thus, establishing the complete life cycle of malarial parasite.[16][17][18][19][20][21]/nIn September 1898 he went to southern Assam in (northeast India) to study an epidemic of Visceral leishmaniasis. He was invited to work there by Graham Col Ville Ramsay, the second Medical Officer of the Labac Tea Estate Hospital. (His microscope and medicals tools are still preserved, and his sketches of mosquitoes are still on display at the hospital.)[22][23] However, he utterly failed as he believed that the kala-azar parasite (Leishmania donovani, the very scientific name he later gave in 1903) was transmitted by a mosquito, which he refers to as Anopheles rossi (scientific name given by G.M. Giles).[24] (It is now known that kala azar is transmitted by sandflies.)/nIn 1899, Ross resigned from Indian Medical Service and went to England to join the faculty of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine as lecturer. He continued to work on prevention of malaria in different parts of the world, including West Africa, the Suez Canal zone,[25] Greece, Mauritius, Cyprus, and in the areas affected by the First World War. He also initiated organisations, which proved to be well established, for fighting malaria in India and Sri Lanka. In 1902, Ross was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh. He was appointed as Professor and Chair of Tropical Medicine of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in 1902, which he held up to 1912. In 1912 he was appointed Physician for Tropical Diseases at King's College Hospital in London, and simultaneously hold the Chair of Tropical Sanitation in Liverpool. He remained in these posts until 1917 when he became (honorary) Consultant in Malariology in British War Office. He travelled to Thessaloniki and Italy in November to advise and on the way, \"in a landlocked bay close to the Leucadian Rock (where Sappho is supposed to have drowned herself)\", his ship escaped a torpedo attack.[26] Between 1918 and 1926 he worked as Consultant in Malaria in the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance./nRoss developed mathematical models for the study of malaria epidemiology, which he initiated in his report on Mauritius in 1908. He elaborated the concept in his book The Prevention of Malaria in 1910[27] (2nd edition in 1911) and further elaborated in a more generalised form in scientific papers published by the Royal Society in 1915 and 1916; some of his epidemiology work was developed with mathematician Hilda Hudson. These papers represented a profound mathematical interest which was not confined to epidemiology, but led him to make material contributions to both pure and applied mathematics./nRoss was one of the supporters of Sir William Osler in the founding of the History of Medicine Society in 1912, and in 1913 was the history of medicine section's vice-president.[28] Between 1913 and 1917, he received some financial support from Sir Edwin Durning-Lawrence, and led experiments at the Marcus Beck laboratory in the Royal Society of Medicine building at 1 Wimpole Street, London.[29]/nThe Ross Institute and Hospital for Tropical Diseases was founded in 1926 and established at Bath House, a grand house with keeper's lodge and large grounds adjacent to Tibbet's Corner at Putney Heath. The hospital was opened by the then Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VIII.[30] Ross assumed the post of Director-in-Chief until his death.[6] The institute was later incorporated into the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine in Keppel Street. Bath House was later demolished and mansion flats built on the property. In memory of its history and owner the block was named Ross Court. Within the grounds an older dwelling, Ross Cottage, remains./nRonald Ross was awarded a Nobel Prize for his discovery of the life cycle of malarial parasite in birds. He did not build his concept of malarial transmission in humans, but in birds.[2] Ross was the first to show that malarial parasite was transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes, in his case the avian Plasmodium relictum. In 1897, an Italian physician and zoologist Giovanni Battista Grassi, along with his colleagues, had established the developmental stages of malaria parasites in anopheline mosquitoes; and they described the complete life cycles of P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. malariae the following year.[31][32]/nWhen the 1902 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine was considered, the Nobel Committee initially intended the prize to be shared between Ross and Grassi, however Ross accused Grassi of deliberate fraud. The weight of favour ultimately fell on Ross, largely due to the influences of Robert Koch, the appointed neutral arbitrator in the committee; as reported, \"Koch threw the full weight of his considerable authority in insisting that Grassi did not deserve the honor\".[33]/nRonald Ross was noted to be eccentric and egocentric, described as an \"impulsive man\"[34] or an \"impulsive genius.\"[35] His professional life appeared to be in constant feud with his students, colleagues, and fellow scientists.[36] His personal vendetta with G. B. Grassi became a legendary tale in science. He was openly envious of his mentor Patrick Manson's affluence from private practices. His Memories of Sir Patrick Manson (1930) was a direct attempt to belittle Manson's influences on his works on malaria.[8] He hardly had good ties with the administration of Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, complaining of being underpaid. He resigned twice, and was eventually discharged without any pension.[37]/nRoss was frequently embittered by lack of government support (what he called \"administrative barbarism\")[4] for scientists in medical research. In 1928 he advertised his papers for sale in the journal Science Progress in the Twentieth Century (1919-1933), with a statement that the money was for financial support of his wife and family. Lady Houston bought them for \u00a32000, and offered them to the British Museum, which turned her down for various reasons. The papers are now preserved by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine[3][38] and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow.[39]/nIn 1889 Ross married Rosa Bessie Bloxam (d.1931). They had two daughters, Dorothy (1891\u20131947) and Sylvia (1893\u20131925), and two sons, Ronald Campbell (1895\u20131914) and Charles Claye (1901\u20131966). His wife died in 1931. Ronald and Sylvia pre-deceased him too: Ronald was killed at the Battle of Le Cateau on 26 August 1914.[40] Ross died at the hospital of his namesake after a long illness and asthma attack. He was buried at the nearby Putney Vale Cemetery, next to his wife.[41][42][43]/nA small memorial on the walls of SSKM Hospital, Calcutta commemorates Ross's discovery. The memorial was unveiled by Ross himself, in the presence of Lord Lytton, on 7 January 1927.[44] The laboratory where Ross worked has been transferred into a malaria clinic named after him. There is also a plaque on the outer wall.[45]/nSir Ronald Ross is one of 23 names to feature on the frieze of London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, pioneers chosen for their contributions to public health.[46]/nA novel, The Calcutta Chromosome by Amitav Ghosh, published in 1995 is based on the life of Ross in Calcutta.[47]/nSir Ronald Ross Institute of Parasitology is the building in Begumpet where Ross made the discovery that malaria was transmitted by the female anopheles mosquito on 20 August. 20 August later came to known as the World Mosquito Day. The lab has been transformed into a small museum exhibiting photos of Ross and his family. Various charts and diagrams explain Ross' work on malaria and its transmission.[45]/nRoss was a prolific writer. He habitually wrote poems on most of the important events in his life. His poetic works gained him wide acclaim and they reflect his medical service, travelogue, philosophical and scientific thoughts. Many of his poems are collected in his Selected Poems (1928) and In Exile (1931). Some of his notable books are The Child of Ocean (1899 and 1932), The Revels of Orsera, The Spirit of Storm, Fables and Satires (1930), Lyra Modulatu (1931), and five mathematical works (1929\u20131931). He also compiled an extensive account The Prevention of Malaria in 1910 and another Studies on Malaria in 1928. He published his autobiography Memoirs, with a Full Account of the Great Malaria Problem and its Solution (547 pages long) in 1923. He carefully saved virtually everything about himself: correspondence, telegrams, newspaper cuttings, drafts of published and unpublished material, and all manner of ephemera.[4]/nRonald Ross was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1902 \"for his work on malaria, by which he has shown how it enters the organism and thereby has laid the foundation for successful research on this disease and methods of combating it\".[48]/n20 August is celebrated by London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine as World Mosquito Day to commemorate Ross's discovery in 1897.[49] Additionally, Ross's name, along with 22 other pioneers of public health and tropical medicine, appears on the School's Frieze.[50] The papers of Sir Ronald Ross are now preserved by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine[3][38] and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow.[39]/nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1901 and of the Royal College of Surgeons in the same year. He was appointed Vice-President of the Royal Society from 1911 to 1913. In 1902 he was appointed a Companion of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath by King Edward VII. In 1911 he was promoted to the rank of Knight Commander of the same Order. He was also decorated with the title Officer of the Order of Leopold II of Belgium.[3]/nRoss received honorary membership of learned societies of most countries in Europe, and elsewhere. He got an honorary M.D. degree in Stockholm in 1910 at the centenary celebration of the Caroline Institute and his 1923 autobiography Memoirs was awarded that year's James Tait Black Memorial Prize. While his vivacity and single-minded search for truth caused friction with some people, he enjoyed a vast circle of friends in Europe, Asia and the United States who respected him for his personality as well as for his genius.[3]/nIn India, Ross is remembered with great respect as a result of his work on malaria, the deadly epidemic which used to claim thousands of lives every year. There are roads named after him in many Indian towns and cities. In Calcutta the road linking Presidency General Hospital with Kidderpore Road has been renamed after him as Sir Ronald Ross Sarani. Earlier this road was known as Hospital Road. In his memory, the regional infectious disease hospital at Hyderabad was named Sir Ronald Ross Institute of Tropical and Communicable Diseases. The building where he worked and actually discovered the malarial parasite, located in Secunderabad near the Begumpet Airport, is a declared a heritage site and the road leading up to the building is named Sir Ronald Ross Road./nIn Ludhiana, Christian Medical College has named its hostel as \"Ross Hostel\". The young medics often refer to themselves as \"Rossians\"./nThe University of Surrey, UK, has named a road after him in its Manor Park Residences.[51]/nRonald Ross Primary School near Wimbledon Common is named after him.

He was a Professor Emeritus at Tel Aviv University and the Ohio State University./nDavid Schmeidler was born in 1939 in Krak\u00f3w, Poland. He spent the war years in Russia and moved back to Poland at the end of the war and to Israel in 1949.\u00a0From 1960 to 1969 he studied mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (BSc, MSc, and PhD), the advanced degrees under the supervision of Robert Aumann.\u00a0He visited the Catholic University of Louvain and University of California at Berkeley before joining Tel-Aviv University in 1971, holding professorships in statistics, economics, and management.\u00a0He held a part-time position as professor of economics at the Ohio State University since 1987. Schmeidler died on 17 March 2022./nSchmeidler's early contributions were in game theory and general equilibrium theory.\u00a0He suggested a new approach to solving cooperative games \u2013 the nucleolus \u2013 based on equity as well as feasibility considerations.\u00a0This concept, originating from Schmeidler's PhD dissertation, was used to resolve a 2000 years old problem.\u00a0Robert Aumann and Michael Maschler, in a paper published in 1985, showed that a conundrum from the Babylonian Talmud, which defied scholars\u2019 attempts at comprehension over two millennia, was naturally resolved when applying the concept of the nucleolus.[1]/nSchmeidler also pioneered the study of non-atomic strategic games,[2] in which each player has negligible impact on the play of the game, as well as the related concept of \u201ccongestion games\u201d, where a player's payoff only depends on the distribution of the other players\u2019 strategic choices (and not on individual choices)./nSchmeidler has made many other contributions, ranging from conceptual issues in implementation theory, to mathematical results in measure theory.\u00a0But his most influential contribution is probably in decision theory.\u00a0Schmeidler was the first to propose a general-purpose, axiomatically-based decision theoretic model that deviated from the Bayesian dictum, according to which any uncertainty can and should be quantified by probabilities.\u00a0He suggested and axiomatized Choquet Expected Utility,[3][4] according to which uncertainty is modeled by a capacity (not-necessarily-additive set function) and expectation is computed by the Choquet integral./nWhile this approach can be used to explain commonly observed behavior in Ellsberg's experiments, Schmeidler's motivation was not to explain psychological findings. Rather, along the lines attributed to Frank Knight and John Maynard Keynes, the argument is normative, suggesting that it is not necessarily more rational to be Bayesian than not.[5]\u00a0While in the experiments, drawing balls from urns, one may adopt a probabilistic belief, in real life one often couldn't find a natural candidate for one's beliefs.[6]/nWith Elisha Pazner, he introduced the notion of egalitarian equivalence - a criterion for fair division of homogeneous resources, that has advantages over the previously studied criterion of envy-freeness./nWith his student, Itzhak Gilboa, David Schmeidler also developed the theory maxmin expected utility[7] and case-based decision theory.[8][9]\u00a0He has also served as the advisor of Peter Wakker, Shiri Alon, and Xiangyu Qu./nDavid Schmeidler was a Fellow of the Econometric Society, Honorary Foreign Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a Member of the Israeli Academy of Sciences and Humanities.\u00a0He served as the President of the Game Theory Society (2014\u20132016).", "30747184": "Antoine Meyer, also known as Antun or Tun Meyer (1801\u20131857) was a Luxembourg-born mathematician and poet who later adopted Belgian nationality. Sometimes referred to as the father of Luxembourgish literature, he is remembered for publishing the very first book in Luxembourgish, a collection of six poems entitled \"E' Schrek ob de' lezeburger Parnassus\" (A Step up the Luxembourg Parnassus).[1]/nBorn on 31 May 1801 in Luxembourg City, Meyer was the son of Hubert\nMeyer, a shoemaker, and his wife Elisabeth Kirschenbilder who lived in the centre of the old town close to the Place d'Armes. After completing his secondary school education with flying colours at the local Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e, he studied mathematics at Li\u00e8ge (1817\u20131823) where he was forced to give private lessons to his fellow students and help out in the library in order to pay for his studies. After receiving his doctorate, he spent an additional year in Paris studying at the Coll\u00e8ge de France and at the Sorbonne where he came into contact with Europe's leading mathematicians.[2]/nProfessionally, Meyer was a brilliant mathematics teacher. In 1826, he taught at the Coll\u00e8ge royal at Echternach in Luxembourg before moving to Breda in the Netherlands in 1828 where he worked at the newly opened Royal Military Academy. However, when two years later the Belgians rose up against the Dutch, he had to leave the country. After enormous difficulties, he finally succeeded in finding a job in Belgium at a school in Louvain. He spent a short period at the Institut Gaggia (1834) in Brussels but was then offered a post at the military school before going on to the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles in 1838. In 1849, he became a professor of higher mathematics at the Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge until his death in 1857. For historical reasons, after the separation of Belgian Luxembourg, Meyer acquired Belgian nationality in 1842. The strong recognition he received for his mathematical publications and achievements testify to his full adoption by the Belgians. However, his poems show his lifelong attachment to Luxembourg.[2]/nAntoine Meyer's publication of \"E' Schrek ob de' Lezeburger Parnassus\" in 1829 was not received with very much enthusiasm. There were however one or two strong supporters. F\u00e9lix Thyes, who coincidentally was the first Luxembourger to publish a book in French, commented: \"It is Monsieur Antoine Meyer, a mathematics professor at the University of Li\u00e8ge, who has the honour of being the first to rescue this tongue from the indifference and scorn in which it is immersed, creating, as it were, a new literature. The good Luxembourgers were amazed, one morning, when they heard that the learned mathematician had just published a small volume of poems in their own language.\" The book contains six poems, a love poem: \"Uen d'Christine\" (To Christine), a meditation on the romantic subject of night: \"D'Nuecht\" (The Night), a kind of real life painting: \"Een Abl\u00e9ck an engem Wiertshaus zu L\u00ebtzebuerg\" (A Moment in a Luxembourg Inn), and three fables: \"D'porzelains an d'ierde Schierbel\" (The Shard of Porcelain and the Earthen Pot), \"D'Sp\u00e9ngel an d'Nol\" (The Pin and the Needle) and \"D'Flou an de Pierdskr\u00e9cher\" (The Fly and the Horse Trough). In regard to the fables, while Aesop and La Fontaine built their stories around animals, Meyer personified inanimate objects. For example, in \"D'Sp\u00e9ngel an d'Nol\", the well-to-do Miss Needle tries but fails to override the Pin, reflecting the failure of the French aristocracy to prevent the French Revolution.[2]/nThe mathematician went on to write three more poetic works as well as a booklet on spelling rules for Luxembourgish. A number of other poems by Antoine Meyer were published in the press. In his own words, Meyer's objective was to show that \"the Luxembourg dialect is not as rough, poor, unregulated, stiff and barbarous as many born Luxembourgers would like to maintain\". F\u00e9lix Thyes commented: \"We see in Mr Meyer, that noble pride of the plebeian, that instinct for liberty and often that burning concern for the poorer classes which can be found among all true poets of our times.\" It is now recognized that he succeeded in initiating the transformation of Luxembourgish into an acceptable literary language.[2][3]/nAntoine Meyer died in Li\u00e8ge on 29 April 1857.", "70986291": "Anna Sierpi\u0144ska (1947 \u2013 October 19, 2023)[1][2] was a Polish-Canadian scholar of mathematics education, known for her investigations of understanding and epistemology in mathematics education.

Today regarded as one of the most important figures of the later Scottish Enlightenment, he was renowned as a populariser of the work of Francis Hutcheson and of Adam Smith. Trained in mathematics, medicine and philosophy,[1] his lectures at the University of Edinburgh were widely disseminated by his many influential students. In 1783 he was a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In most contemporary documents he is referred to as Prof Dougal Stewart.[2]/nHe was the son of Matthew Stewart (1715\u20131785), professor of mathematics at the University of Edinburgh (1747\u20131772), and was born in his father's quarters at Old College. His mother was Marjory Stewart, his father's cousin./nHe was educated at the High School and the University of Edinburgh, where he studied mathematics and moral philosophy under Adam Ferguson. In 1771, in the hope of gaining a Snell Exhibition Scholarship and proceeding to Oxford to study for the English Church, he went to the University of Glasgow to attend the classes of Thomas Reid. To Reid he later owed his theory of morality. In Glasgow, Stewart boarded in the same house as Archibald Alison, author of the Essay on Taste, and a lasting friendship sprang up between them.[3]/nAfter a single session in Glasgow University, at the age of nineteen, Dugald was asked by his father, whose health was beginning to fail, to give his mathematical classes in the University of Edinburgh. After three years there, in 1775, Dugald was elected joint professor of mathematics in conjunction with his father. Three years later Ferguson was appointed secretary to the commissioners sent out to the American colonies, and at his request Stewart lectured as his substitute during the session 1778\u20131779, delivering an original course of lectures on morals.[3] In his early years he was influenced by Lord Monboddo, with whom he corresponded./nIn 1785 Stewart succeeded Ferguson in the chair of moral philosophy, which he filled for twenty-five years, making it a centre of intellectual and moral influence. Young men were attracted by his reputation from England, Europe and America. Greatly influenced by the Irish Presbyterian Francis Hutcheson who, in the preceding generation, had held the chair of moral philosophy at the University of Glasgow, Stewart's course on moral philosophy embraced, besides ethics proper, lectures on political philosophy or the theory of government.[3]/nWilliam Drennan, whose father Thomas Drennan had been secretary to Hutcheson, and who 1791 moved the formation of the Society of United Irishmen in Belfast and in Dublin, was a student and friend.[4] It is from Stewart that Drennan is said to have \"imbibed the classical tradition of republican theory, in its most famous English embodiment in the works of John Locke, and its contemporary reincarnation in the works of Richard Price and Joseph Priestley\".[5]/nStewart's dissident rationalism greatly influenced Maria Edgeworth and Elizabeth Hamilton. They drew extensively on his work in constructing educational programmes that rested on the assumption that women, and especially mothers, were intellectually capable of understanding the importance of the early association of ideas in the training of children's emotions and reasoning powers.[6]/nStewart spent the summers of 1788 and 1789 in France, where he met Suard, Deg\u00e9rando, and Raynal, and came to sympathise with the revolutionary movement.[3] His political teaching, after the French Revolution, drew suspicion on him. His Edinburgh residence for several years was Whitefoord House on the Royal Mile.[7]/nFrom 1800 to 1801, Stewart gave lectures to undergraduate students on the subject of political economy, the first person to do so.[8] Stewart made himself the leading disciple of Adam Smith and, after Smith's death became his first biographer. In 1793 Stewart had read his Account of the Life and Writings of Adam Smith to the Royal Society of Edinburgh./nIn 1797 he appears as \"Dougald Stewart, professor of moral philosophy\" living at Lothian House near the bottom of the Canongate.[9]/nIn 1783 Stewart married Helen Bannatyne (a distant cousin),[10] who died in 1787, leaving him an only son, Matthew Stewart FRSE (1784-1851). In 1790 he married Helen D'Arcy Cranstoun, sister of George Cranstoun.  His second wife was well-born and accomplished, and he was in the habit of submitting to her criticism whatever he wrote. They had a son and a daughter. The son's death in 1809 brought about his retirement from the active duties of his chair.[3]/nHis sister, Janet Stewart, married Rev Thomas Miller of Cumnock, and they were parents to Dr Patrick Miller FRSE (1782-1871).[11]/nIn 1806 Stewart received in lieu of a pension the nominal office of the writership of the Edinburgh Gazette, with a salary of \u00a3300. When he ceased lecturing during the session of 1809\u20131810, his place was taken, at his own request, by Thomas Brown, who in 1810 was appointed conjoint professor. On the death of Brown in 1820 Stewart retired altogether from the professorship. His successor was John Wilson, known as \"Christopher North\".[3]/nFrom 1809 onwards Stewart lived mainly at Kinneil House, Bo'ness, which was placed at his disposal by the Duke of Hamilton.[3] He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1791.[12] In June 1814 Stewart was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.[13] He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1817.[14]/nLike his father, Rev Dr Matthew Stewart, he was a Scottish Freemason. He was Initiated in the Lodge of his father - Lodge Canongate Kilwinning, No.2, on 4 December 1775.[15]/nHis friend and fellow Freemason, Robert Burns, made him an honorary member of Lodge St David, Tarbolton, No. 133, on 25 July 1787. This was whilst Stewart was staying at the family seat at Catrine, Ayrshire.[16]/nIn 1822 he was struck with paralysis, but recovered a fair degree of health, sufficient to enable him to resume his studies. He died in Edinburgh on 11 June 1828, where he was buried in Canongate Churchyard, close to his Edinburgh residence. He is buried in an enclosed vault in the lower section, on its west side./nIn 1831, and of great public note, a monument was erected by the city on Calton Hill.[3] This is to a design by William Henry Playfair and holds a commanding position in the city skyline, forming one of the city's iconic landmarks.[17]/nHis memory is also honoured by the \"Dugald Stewart Building\" (erected 2011) for the University of Edinburgh to house its Philosophy Department, on Charles Street, off George Square./nStewart as a student in Glasgow wrote an essay on Dreaming. In 1792 he published the first volume of the Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind; the second volume appeared in 1814, the third not till 1827. In 1793 he printed a textbook, Outlines of Moral Philosophy, which went through many editions; and in the same year he read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh his Account of the Life and Writings of Adam Smith. Similar memoirs of Robertson the historian and of Reid were afterwards read before the same body and appear in his published works.[3]/nIn 1805 Stewart published pamphlets defending John Leslie against the charges of unorthodoxy made by the presbytery of Edinburgh. In 1810 appeared the Philosophical Essays,[18] in 1814 the second volume of the Elements, in 1811 the first part and in 1821 the second part of the \"Dissertation\" written for the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Supplement, entitled \"A General View of the Progress of Metaphysical, Ethical, and Political Philosophy since the Revival of Letters.\" In 1827 he published the third volume of the Elements, and in 1828, a few weeks before his death, The Philosophy of the Active and Moral Powers.[3]/nStewart's works were edited in 11 vols. (1854\u20131858) by Sir William Hamilton and completed with a memoir by John Veitch.[3]/nAmong Stewart's pupils were Lord Palmerston, Sir Walter Scott, Francis Jeffrey, Henry Thomas Cockburn, Francis Horner, Sydney Smith, John William Ward, Lord Brougham, Dr. Thomas Brown, James Mill, Sir James Mackintosh and Sir Archibald Alison.[3]/nHis reputation rested as much on his eloquence, populism, and style as on original work.[19] He was principally responsible for making the \"Scottish philosophy\" predominant in early 19th-century Europe.[19] In the second half of the century, Stewart's reputation fell to that of a follower of the work of Thomas Reid.[3]/nStewart upheld Reid's psychological method and expounded the Scottish Common Sense Realism,[20] which was attacked by James Mill and John Stuart Mill. Part of his originality lay in his incorporation of elements of moderate empiricism and the French ideologists Laromigui\u00e8re, Cabanis and Destutt de Tracy. He opposed the argument of ontology, and Condillac's sensationalism. Immanuel Kant, he said, he could not understand.[21]", "49982078": "Claire Mathieu (formerly Kenyon, born 1965[1]) is a French computer scientist and mathematician, known for her research on approximation algorithms, online algorithms, and auction theory.

This work provided examples for which the equivalence between motivic and automorphic L-functions postulated in the Langlands program could be tested: automorphic forms realized in the cohomology of a Shimura variety have a construction that attaches Galois representations to them.[8]/nIn 1958, Shimura generalized the initial work of Martin Eichler on the Eichler\u2013Shimura congruence relation between the local L-function of a modular curve and the eigenvalues of Hecke operators.[9][10] In 1959, Shimura extended the work of Eichler on the Eichler\u2013Shimura isomorphism between Eichler cohomology groups and spaces of cusp forms which would be used in Pierre Deligne's proof of the Weil conjectures.[11][12]/nIn 1971, Shimura's work on explicit class field theory in the spirit of Kronecker's Jugendtraum resulted in his proof of Shimura's reciprocity law.[13] In 1973, Shimura established the Shimura correspondence between modular forms of half integral weight k+1/2, and modular forms of even weight 2k.[14]/nShimura's formulation of the Taniyama\u2013Shimura conjecture (later known as the modularity theorem) in the 1950s played a key role in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles in 1995. In 1990, Kenneth Ribet proved Ribet's theorem which demonstrated that Fermat's Last Theorem followed from the semistable case of this conjecture.[15] Shimura dryly commented that his first reaction on hearing of Andrew Wiles's proof of the semistable case was 'I told you so'.[16]/nHis hobbies were shogi problems of extreme length and collecting Imari porcelain.

The Cultural Revolution interrupted all academic research in China starting in 1966. Yang and Zhang picked up their research late 1971, and published another paper in Scientia Sinica in 1973. Their best results were published there in 1975 and 1976 where they proposed the \"Yang-Zhang Theorem\". This theorem posited a clear and close connection between two basic concepts in value distribution theory that had long been considered unrelated to each other, the connection between \"deficit value\" and \"singular direction\" (Borel direction), and gave a quantitative expression of this connection. This was a breakthrough result that attracted the attention of mathematicians in the field of function theory internationally. In addition, they used constructive methods to solve the problem of the distribution law of singular directions of meromorphic functions, that is, they gave the construction of meromorphic functions with specified Borel directions.[4] After China opened up in 1978, Yang cooperated with mathematicians in other countries, such as David Drasin in the U.S. and Walter K. Hayman in the U.K., and published papers internationally.

He received his Ph.D in physics in 1947 with a dissertation on commensurate line theory that marked the beginning of this field.[3]/nAt RRL Richards worked on microwave filters, an important component of radar and countermeasures against it.  This work formed the background for his commensurate line theory, although that theory was apparently not well developed enough at the time to be put to use in wartime work.  The culmination of this theory was in his 1948 paper \"Resistor-transmission-line circuits\", after which Richards left the field of microwave engineering.  The theory formed the basis of most transmission-line type microwave filters for at least the next thirty-five years and the design technique is still in use today.[3] Richards' transformation, introduced in this work, is still found in modern textbooks on radio frequency filter design.[4]  During this period Richards also discovered a theorem in complex analysis now known as Richards' theorem which has applications in network synthesis.[5]/nBetween 1947 and 1952 he was a physicist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory helping to develop the magnetic time-of-flight mass spectrometer with Earl E.

Later in his life, Th\u0101bit's patron was the Abbasid Caliph al-Mu'tadid (reigned 892\u2013902), whom he became a court astronomer for.[9] Th\u0101bit became the Caliph's personal friend and courtier. Th\u0101bit died in Baghdad in 901. His son, Sinan ibn Thabit and grandson, Ibrahim ibn Sinan would also make contributions to the medicine and science.[10] By the end of his life, Th\u0101bit had managed to write 150 works on mathematics, astronomy, and medicine.[11] With all the work done by Th\u0101bit, most of his work has not lasted time. There are less than a dozen works by him that have survived.[10]/nTh\u0101bit's native language was Syriac,[12] which was the Middle Aramaic variety from Edessa, and he was fluent in both Medieval Greek and Arabic.[13] He was the author to multiple treaties. Due to him being trilingual, Th\u0101bit was able to have a major role during the Graeco-Arabic translation movement.[10] He would also make a school of translation in Baghdad.[11]/nTh\u0101bit translated from Greek into Arabic works by Apollonius of Perga, Archimedes, Euclid and Ptolemy. He revised the translation of Euclid's Elements of Hunayn ibn Ishaq. He also rewrote Ishaq ibn Hunayn's translation of Ptolemy's Almagest and translated Ptolemy's Geography.Th\u0101bit's translation of a work by Archimedes which gave a construction of a regular heptagon was discovered in the 20th century, the original having been lost.[citation needed]/nTh\u0101bit is believed to have been an astronomer of Caliph al-Mu'tadid.[14] Th\u0101bit was able to use his mathematical work on the examination of Ptolemaic astronomy.[10] The medieval astronomical theory of the trepidation of the equinoxes is often attributed to Th\u0101bit.[citation needed] But it had already been described by Theon of Alexandria in his comments of the Handy Tables of Ptolemy. According to Copernicus, Th\u0101bit determined the length of the sidereal year as 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes and 12 seconds (an error of 2 seconds). Copernicus based his claim on the Latin text attributed to Th\u0101bit. Th\u0101bit published his observations of the Sun.[citation needed] In regards to Ptolemy's Planetary Hypotheses, Th\u0101bit examined the problems of the motion of the sun and moon, and the theory of sundials.[10] When looking at Ptolemy's Hypotheses, Th\u0101bit ibn Qurra found the Sidereal year which is when looking at the Earth and measuring it against the background of fixed stars, it will have a constant value.[15]/nTh\u0101bit was also an author and wrote De Anno Solis. This book contained and recorded facts about the evolution in astronomy in the ninth century.[14] Th\u0101bit mentioned in the book that Ptolemy and Hipparchus believed that the movement of stars is consistent with the movement commonly found in planets. What Th\u0101bit believed is that this idea can be broadened to include the Sun and moon.[14] With that in mind, he also thought that the solar year should be calculated by looking at the sun's return to a given star.[14]/nIn mathematics, Th\u0101bit derived an equation for determining amicable numbers. His proof of this rule is presented in the Treatise on the Derivation of the Amicable Numbers in an Easy Way.[16] This was done while writing on the theory of numbers, extending their use to describe the ratios between geometrical quantities, a step which the Greeks did not take. Th\u0101bit's work on amicable numbers and number theory helped him to invest more heavily into the Geometrical relations of numbers establishing his Transversal (geometry) theorem.[11][16]/nTh\u0101bit described a generalized proof of the Pythagorean theorem.[17] He provided a strengthened extension[clarification needed] of Pythagoras' proof which included the knowledge of Euclid's fifth postulate.[18] This postulate states that the intersection between two straight line segments combine to create two interior angles which are less than 180 degrees. The method of reduction and composition[clarification needed] used by Th\u0101bit resulted in a combination and extension[clarification needed] of contemporary and ancient knowledge on this famous proof. Th\u0101bit believed that geometry was tied with the equality and differences of magnitudes of lines and angles,[clarification needed] as well as that ideas of motion (and ideas taken from physics more widely) should be integrated in geometry.[19][clarification needed]/nThe continued work done on geometric relations and the resulting exponential series allowed Th\u0101bit to calculate multiple solutions to chessboard problems. This problem was less to do with the game itself, and more to do with the number of solutions or the nature of solutions possible. In Th\u0101bit's case, he worked with combinatorics to work on the permutations needed to win a game of chess.[20]/nIn addition to Th\u0101bit's work on Euclidean geometry there is evidence that he was familiar with the geometry of Archimedes as well. His work with conic sections and the calculation of a paraboloid shape (cupola) show his proficiency as an Archimedean geometer. This is further embossed[clarification needed] by Th\u0101bit's use of the Archimedean property in order to produce a rudimentary approximation of the volume of a paraboloid. The use of uneven sections, while relatively simple, does show a critical understanding of both Euclidean and Archimedean geometry.[21] Th\u0101bit was also responsible for a commentary on Archimedes' Liber Assumpta.[22]/nIn physics, Th\u0101bit rejected the Peripatetic and Aristotelian notions of a \"natural place\" for each element. He instead proposed a theory of motion in which both the upward and downward motions are caused by weight, and that the order of the universe is a result of two competing attractions (jadhb): one of these being \"between the sublunar and celestial elements\", and the other being \"between all parts of each element separately\".[23] and in mechanics he was a founder of statics.[24] In addition, Th\u0101bit's Liber Karatonis contained proof of the law of the lever. This work was the result of combining Aristotelian and Archimedean ideas of dynamics and mechanics.[11]/nOne of Qurra's most important pieces of text is his work with the Kitab fi 'l-qarastun. This text consists of Arabic mechanical tradition.[25] Another piece of important text is Kitab fi sifat alwazn, which discussed concepts of equal-armed balance. Qurra was reportedly one of the first to write about the concept of equal-armed balance or at least to systematize the treatment./nQurra sought to establish a relationship between forces of motion and the distance traveled by the mobile.[25]/nTh\u0101bit was well known as a physician and produced a substantial number of medical treatises and commentaries. His works included general reference books such as al-Dhakhira f\u012b ilm al-tibb (\"A Treasury of Medicine\"), Kit\u0101b al-Rawda fi l\u2013tibb (\"Book of the Garden of Medicine\"), and al-Kunnash (\"Collection\"). He also produced specific works on topics such as gallstones; the treatment of diseases such as smallpox, measles, and conditions of the eye; and discussed veterinary medicine and the anatomy of birds. Th\u0101bit wrote commentaries on the works of Galen and others, including such works as On Plants (attributed to Aristotle but likely written by the first-century BC philosopher Nicolaus of Damascus).[5]/nOne account of Th\u0101bit's work as a physician is given in Ibn al-Qift\u012b's Ta\u2019rikh al-hukam\u0101, where Th\u0101bit is credited with healing a butcher who was presumed to be certain to die.[5]/nOnly a few of Th\u0101bit's works are preserved in their original form./nAdditional works by Th\u0101bit include:", "65481405": "Ulrike Leopold-Wildburger (born 1949)[1] is an Austrian mathematical economist, applied mathematician, and operations researcher.

As an Integration theorist, he is notable for Henstock\u2013Kurzweil integral. Henstock brought the theory to a highly developed stage without ever having encountered Jaroslav Kurzweil's 1957 paper on the subject./nHe was born in the coal-mining village of Newstead, Nottinghamshire, the only child of mineworker and former coalminer William Henstock and Mary Ellen Henstock (n\u00e9e Bancroft). On the Henstock side he was descended from 17th century  Flemish immigrants called Hemstok./nBecause of his early academic promise it was expected that Henstock would attend the University of Nottingham where his father and uncle had received technical education, but as it turned out he won scholarships which enabled him to study mathematics at St John's College, Cambridge from October 1941 until November 1943, when he was sent for war service to the Ministry of Supply's department of Statistical Method and Quality Control in London./nThis work did not satisfy him, so he enrolled at Birkbeck College, London where he joined the weekly seminar of Professor Paul Dienes which was then a focus for mathematical activity in London. Henstock wanted to study divergent series but Dienes prevailed upon him to get involved in the theory of integration, thereby setting him on course for his life's work./nA devoted Methodist, the lasting impression he made was one of gentle sincerity and amiability. Henstock married Marjorie Jardine in 1949. Their son John was born 10 July 1952. Ralph Henstock died on 17 January 2007 after a short illness./nHe was awarded the Cambridge B.A. in 1944 and began research for the PhD in Birkbeck College, London, under the supervision of Paul Dienes. His PhD thesis, entitled Interval Functions and their Integrals, was submitted in December 1948. His Ph.D. examiners were Burkill and H. Kestelman. In 1947 he returned briefly to Cambridge to complete the undergraduate mathematical studies which had been truncated by his Ministry of Supply work./nMost of Henstock's work was concerned with integration. From initial studies of the Burkill and Ward integrals he formulated an integration process whereby the domain of integration is suitably partitioned for Riemann sums to approximate the integral of a function. His methods led to an integral on the real line that was very similar in construction and simplicity to the Riemann integral but which included the Lebesgue integral and, in addition, allowed non-absolute convergence./nThese ideas were developed from the late 1950s. Independently, Jaroslav Kurzweil developed a similar Riemann-type integral on the real line. The resulting integral is now known as the Henstock-Kurzweil integral. On the real line it is equivalent to the Denjoy-Perron integral, but has a simpler definition./nIn the following decades, Henstock developed extensively the distinctive features of his theory, inventing the concepts of division spaces or integration bases to demonstrate in general settings the properties and characteristics of mathematical integration. His theory provides a unified approach to non-absolute integral, as different kinds of Henstock integral, choosing an appropriate integration basis (division space, in Henstock's own terminology). It has been used in differential and integral equations, harmonic analysis, probability theory and Feynman integration. Numerous monographs and texts have appeared since 1980 and there have been several conferences devoted to the theory. It has been taught in standard courses in mathematical analysis./nHenstock was author of 46 journal papers in the period 1946 to 2006. He published four books on analysis (Theory of Integration, 1963; Linear Analysis, 1967; Lectures on the Theory of Integration, 1988; and The General Theory of Integration, 1991). He wrote 171 reviews for MathSciNet. In 1994 he was awarded the Andy Prize of the XVIII Summer Symposium in Real Analysis.

From there he became inspector general of the Imperial University of France. He shared the post with another famous mathematician, Delambre. On 1 November 1809, Poinsot became assistant professor of analysis and mechanics at his old school the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. During this period of transitions between schools and work, Poinsot had remained active in research and published a number of works on geometry, mechanics and statics so that by 1809 he had an excellent reputation./nBy 1812 Poinsot was no longer directly teaching at \u00c9cole Polytechnique using substitute teacher Reynaud, and later Cauchy, and lost his post in 1816 when they re-organized, but he did become admissions examiner and held that for another 10 years. He also worked at the famous Bureau des Longitudes from 1839 until his death. On the death of Joseph-Louis Lagrange in 1813, Poinsot was elected to fill his place at the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences. In 1840 he became a member of the superior council of public instruction. In 1846 he was awarded an Officer of the Legion of Honor, and on the formation of the Senate in 1852 he was chosen a member of that body.

Previous work done on the motion of a rigid body had been purely analytical with no visualization of the motion, and the great value of the work, as Poinsot says, it enables us to represent to ourselves the motion of a rigid body as clearly that as a moving point (Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 1911). In particular, he devised what is now known as Poinsot's construction. This construction describes the motion of the angular velocity vector \n\n\n\n\n\u03c9\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {\\omega } }\n\n of a rigid body with one point fixed (usually its center of mass). He proved that the endpoint of the vector \n\n\n\n\n\u03c9\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {\\omega } }\n\n moves in a plane perpendicular to the  angular momentum (in absolute space) of the rigid body.[2]/nHe discovered the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra in 1809. Two of these had already appeared in Kepler's work of 1619, although Poinsot was unaware of this. The other two are the great icosahedron and great dodecahedron,  which some people call these two the Poinsot solids. In 1810 Cauchy proved, using Poinsot's definition of regular, that the enumeration of regular star polyhedra is complete./nPoinsot worked on number theory studying Diophantine equations. However he is best known for his work in geometry and, together with Monge, regained geometry's leading role in mathematical research in France in the 19th century.

The next year he initiated efforts to emigrate to the United States, but was unable to make arrangements to receive a research fellowship. On 26 January 1942, Felix Hausdorff, along with his wife and his sister-in-law, died by suicide by taking an overdose of veronal, rather than comply with German orders to move to the Endenich camp, and there suffer the likely implications, about which he held no illusions./nHausdorff's father, the Jewish merchant Louis Hausdorff (1843\u20131896), moved with his young family to Leipzig in the autumn of 1870, and over time worked at various companies, including a linen-and cotton goods factory. He was an educated man and had become a Morenu at the age of 14. He wrote several treatises, including a long work on the Aramaic translations of the Bible from the perspective of Talmudic law./nHausdorff's mother, Hedwig (1848\u20131902), who is also referred to in various documents as Johanna, came from the Jewish Tietz family. From another branch of this family came Hermann Tietz, founder of the first department store, and later co-owner of the department store chain called \"Hermann Tietz\". During the period of Nazi dictatorship the name was \"Aryanised\" to Hertie./nFrom 1878 to 1887 Felix Hausdorff attended the Nicolai School in Leipzig, a facility that had a reputation as a hotbed of humanistic education. He was an excellent student, class leader for many years and often recited self-written Latin or German poems at school celebrations./nIn his later years of high school, choosing a main subject of study was not easy for Hausdorff. Magda Dierkesmann, who was often a guest in the home of Hausdorff in the years 1926\u20131932, reported in 1967 that:/nHis versatile musical talent was so great that only the insistence of his father made him give up his plan to study music and become a composer./nHe decided to study the natural sciences, and in his graduating class of 1887 he was the only one who achieved the highest possible grade./nFrom 1887 to 1891 Hausdorff studied mathematics and astronomy, mainly in his native city of Leipzig, interrupted by one semester in Freiburg (summer 1888) and Berlin (winter 1888/1889). Surviving testimony from other students depict him as an extremely versatile and interested young man, who, in addition to the mathematical and astronomical lectures, attended lectures in physics, chemistry and geography, and also lectures on philosophy and history of philosophy, as well as on issues of language, literature and social sciences. In Leipzig he attended lectures on the history of music from musicologist Oscar Paul. His early love of music lasted a lifetime; in Hausdorff's home he held impressive musical evenings with the landlord at the piano, according to witness statements made by various participants. Even as a student in Leipzig, he was an admirer and connoisseur of the music of Richard Wagner./nIn later semesters of his studies, Hausdorff was close to Heinrich Bruns (1848\u20131919). \nBruns was professor of astronomy and director of the observatory at the University of Leipzig. Under his supervision, Hausdorff graduated in 1891 with a work on the theory of astronomical refraction of light in the atmosphere. Two publications on the same subject followed, and in 1895 his Habilitation also followed with a thesis on the absorbance of light in the atmosphere. These early astronomical works of Hausdorff, despite their excellent mathematical formulation, were ultimately of little importance to the scientific community.\nFor one, the underlying idea of Bruns was later shown to not be viable (there was a need for refraction observations near the astronomical horizon, and as Julius Bauschinger would show, this could not be obtained with the required accuracy). And further, the progress in the direct measurement of atmospheric data (from weather balloon ascents) has since made the painstaking accuracy of this data from refraction observations unnecessary. In the time between defending his PhD and his Habilitation, Hausdorff completed his yearlong military requirement, and worked for two years as a human computer at the observatory in Leipzig./nAfter his Habilitation, Hausdorff became a lecturer at the University of Leipzig where he began extensive teaching in a variety of mathematical areas. In addition to teaching and research in mathematics, he also pursued his literary and philosophical inclinations. A man of varied interests, he often associated with a number of famous writers, artists and publishers such as Hermann Conradi, Richard Dehmel, Otto Erich Hartleben, Gustav Kirstein, Max Klinger, Max Reger and Frank Wedekind. The years of 1897 to 1904 mark the high point of his literary and philosophical creativity, during which time 18 of his 22 pseudonymous works were published, including a book of poetry, a play, an epistemological book and a volume of aphorisms./nIn 1899 Hausdorff married Charlotte Goldschmidt, the daughter of Jewish doctor Siegismund Goldschmidt. Her stepmother was the famous suffragist and preschool teacher Henriette Goldschmidt. Hausdorff's only child, his daughter Lenore (Nora), was born in 1900; she survived the era of National Socialism and enjoyed a long life, dying in Bonn in 1991./nIn December 1901 Hausdorff was appointed as adjunct associate professor at the University of Leipzig. An often-repeated factoid, that Hausdorff got a call from G\u00f6ttingen and rejected it, cannot be verified and is most likely wrong. After considering Hausdorff's application to Leipzig, the Dean Kirchner felt compelled to make the following addition to the very positive vote from his colleagues, written by Heinrich Bruns:/nThe faculty, however, considers itself obliged to report to the Royal Ministry that the above application, considered on November 2nd of this year when a faculty meeting had taken place, was not accepted by all, but with 22 votes to 7. The minority was opposed, because Dr. Hausdorff is of the Mosaic faith.[3]/nThis quote emphasizes the undisguised antisemitism present, which especially took a sharp upturn throughout the German Reich after the stock market crash of 1873. Leipzig was a focus of antisemitic sentiment, especially among the student body, which may well be the reason that Hausdorff did not feel at ease in Leipzig. Another contributing factor may also have been the stresses due to the hierarchical posturing of the Leipzig professors./nAfter his Habilitation, Hausdorff wrote other works on optics, on non-Euclidean geometry, and on hypercomplex number systems, as well as two papers on probability theory. However, his main area of work soon became set theory, especially the theory of ordered sets. Initially, it was only out of philosophical interest that Hausdorff began to study Georg Cantor's work, beginning around 1897, but already in 1901 Hausdorff began lecturing on set theory. His was one of the first ever lectures on set theory; only Ernst Zermelo's lectures in G\u00f6ttingen College during the winter of 1900/1901 were earlier. That same year, he published his first paper on order types in which he examined a generalization of well-orderings called graded order types, where a linear order is graded if no two of its segments share the same order type. He generalized the Cantor\u2013Bernstein theorem, which said the collection of countable order types has the cardinality of the continuum and showed that the collection of all graded types of an idempotent cardinality m has a cardinality of 2m.[4]/nFor the summer semester of 1910 Hausdorff was appointed as professor to the University of Bonn. There he began a lecture series on set theory, which he substantially revised and expanded for the summer semester of 1912./nIn the summer of 1912 he also began work on his magnum opus, the book Basics of set theory. It was completed in Greifswald, where Hausdorff had been appointed for the summer semester as full professor in 1913, and was released in April 1914./nThe University of Greifswald was the smallest of the Prussian universities. The mathematical institute there was also small; during the summer of 1916 and the winter of 1916/17, Hausdorff was the only mathematician in Greifswald. This meant that he was almost fully occupied in teaching basic courses. It was thus a substantial improvement for his academic career when Hausdorff was appointed in 1921 to Bonn. There he was free to teach about wider ranges of topics, and often lectured on his latest research. He gave a particularly noteworthy lecture on probability theory (NL Hausdorff: Capsule 21: Fasz 64) in the summer semester of 1923, in which he grounded the theory of probability in measure-theoretic axiomatic theory, ten years before A. N. Kolmogorov's \"Basic concepts of probability theory\" (reprinted in full in the collected works, Volume V). In Bonn, Hausdorff was friends and colleagues with Eduard Study, and later with Otto Toeplitz, who were both\noutstanding mathematicians./nAfter the takeover by the National Socialist party, antisemitism became state doctrine. Hausdorff was not initially concerned by the \"Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service\", adopted in 1933, because he had been a German public servant since before 1914. However, he was not completely spared, as one of his lectures was interrupted by National Socialist student officials. In the winter semester of 1934/1935, there was a working session of the National Socialist German Student Union (NSDStB) at the University of Bonn, which chose \"Race and Ethnicity\" as their theme for the semester. Hausdorff cancelled his 1934/1935 winter semester Calculus III course on 20 November, and it is assumed that the choice of theme was related to the cancellation of Hausdorff's class, since in his long career as a university lecturer he had always taught his courses through to their end./nOn March 31, 1935, after some back and forth, Hausdorff was finally given emeritus status. No words of thanks were given for his 40 years of successful work in the German higher education system./nHis academic legacy shows that Hausdorff was still working mathematically during these increasingly difficult times, and continued to follow current developments of interest. \nHe wrote, in addition to the expanded edition of his work on set theory, seven works on topology and descriptive set theory. These were published in Polish magazines: one in Studia Mathematica, the others in Fundamenta Mathematicae.\nHe was supported at this time by Erich Bessel-Hagen, a loyal friend to the Hausdorff family who obtained books and magazines from the academic library, which Hausdorff was no longer allowed to enter./nA great deal is known about the humiliations to which Hausdorff and his family especially were exposed to after Kristallnacht in 1938. There are many sources, including the letters of Bessel-Hagen.[5]/nIn 1939, Hausdorff asked the mathematician Richard Courant, in vain, for a research fellowship to be able to emigrate into the USA. \nIn mid-1941, the Bonn Jews began to be deported to the \"Monastery for Eternal Adoration\" in Endenich, Bonn, from which the nuns had been expelled. Transports to death camps in the east occurred later. After Hausdorff, his wife, and his wife's sister, Edith Pappenheim (who was living with them), were ordered in January 1942 to move to the Endenich camp, the three died by suicide on 26 January 1942 by taking an overdose of veronal.[6] Their final resting place is located on the cemetery Poppelsdorf in Bonn. In the time between their placement in temporary camps and his suicide, he gave his handwritten Nachlass to the Egyptologist and presbyter Hans Bonnet, who saved as much of them as possible, even despite the destruction of his house by a bomb./nSome of his fellow Jews may have had illusions about the camp Endenich, but not Hausdorff. In the estate of Bessel-Hagen, E. Neuenschwander discovered the farewell letter that Hausdorff wrote to his lawyer Hans Wollstein, who was also Jewish.[7][8] Here is the beginning and end of the letter:/nDear friend Wollstein!/nIf you receive these lines, we (three) have solved the problem in a different manner \u2014 in the manner of which you have constantly tried to dissuade us. The feeling of security that you have predicted for us once we would overcome the difficulties of the move, is still eluding us; on the contrary, Endenich may not even be the end!/nWhat has happened in recent months against the Jews evokes justified fear that they will not let us live to see a more bearable situation./nAfter thanking friends and, in great composure, expressing his last wishes regarding his funeral and his will, Hausdorff writes:/nI am sorry that we cause you yet more effort beyond death, and I am convinced that you are doing what you can do (which perhaps is not very much). Forgive us our desertion! We wish you and all our friends to experience better times./nYour truly devoted/nFelix Hausdorff/nUnfortunately, this desire was not fulfilled. Hausdorff's lawyer, Wollstein, was murdered in Auschwitz./nHausdorff's library was sold by his son-in-law and sole heir, Arthur K\u00f6nig. The portions of Hausdorff's Nachlass which could be saved by Hans Bonnet are now in the University and State Library of Bonn. The Nachlass is catalogued.[9]/nHausdorff's volume of aphorisms, published in 1897, was his first work published under the pseudonym Paul Mongr\u00e9. It is entitled Sant' Ilario: Thoughts from the landscape of Zarathustra. The subtitle  plays first on the fact that Hausdorff had completed his book during a recovery stay on the Ligurian coast by Genoa and that in this same area, Friedrich Nietzsche  wrote the first two parts of Thus Spoke Zarathustra; he also alludes to his spiritual closeness to Nietzsche. In an article on Sant' Ilario in the weekly paper Die Zukunft, Hausdorff acknowledged in expressis verbis his debt to Nietzsche./nHausdorff was not trying to copy or even exceed Nietzsche. \"Of Nietzsche imitation no trace\", says a contemporary review. He follows Nietzsche in an attempt to liberate individual thinking, to take the liberty of questioning outdated standards. Hausdorff maintained critical distance to the late works of Nietzsche. In his essay on the book The Will to Power compiled from notes left in the Nietzsche Archive he says:/nIn Nietzsche glows a fanatic. His morality of breeding, erected on our present biological and physiological foundations of knowledge: that could be a world historical scandal against which the Inquisition and witch trials fade into harmless aberrations./nHis critical standard he took from Nietzsche himself,/nFrom the kind, modest, understanding Nietzsche and from the free spirit of the cool, dogma-free, unsystematic skeptic Nietzsche .../nIn 1898\u2014also under the pseudonym Paul Mongr\u00e9\u2014Hausdorff published an epistemological experiment titled Chaos in cosmic selection. The critique of metaphysics put forward in this book had its starting point in Hausdorff's confrontation with Nietzsche's idea of eternal recurrence. Ultimately, it is about destroying any kind of metaphysics. Of the world itself, of the transcendent core of the world\u2014as Hausdorff puts it\u2014we know nothing and we can know nothing. We must assume \"the world itself\" as undetermined and undeterminable, as mere chaos. The world of our experience, our cosmos, is the result of the selections that we have made and will always instinctively make according to our capacity for understanding. Seen from that chaos, all other frameworks, other cosmos, are conceivable. That is to say, from the world of our cosmos, one cannot draw any conclusions about the transcendent world./nIn 1904, in the magazine The New Rundschau, Hausdorff's play appeared, the one-act play The doctor in his honor. It is a crude satire on the duel and on the traditional concepts of honor and nobility of the Prussian officer corps, which in the developing bourgeois society were increasingly anachronistic. The doctor in his honor was Hausdorff's most popular literary work. In 1914\u20131918 there were numerous performances in more than thirty cities. Hausdorff later wrote an epilogue to the play, but it was not performed at that time. Only in 2006 did this epilogue have its premier at the annual meeting of the German Mathematical Society in Bonn./nBesides the works mentioned above, Hausdorff also wrote numerous essays that appeared in some of the leading literary magazines of the time. He also wrote a book of poems, Ecstasy (1900). Some of his poems were set to music by Austrian composer Joseph Marx./nHausdorff's entrance into a thorough study of ordered sets was prompted in part by Cantor's continuum problem: where should the cardinal number \n\n\n\n\u2135\n=\n\n2\n\n\n\u2135\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\aleph =2^{\\aleph _{0}}}\n\n be placed in the sequence \n\n\n\n{\n\n\u2135\n\n\u03b1\n\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{\\aleph _{\\alpha }\\}}\n\n? In a letter to Hilbert on 29 September 1904, he speaks of this problem, \"it has plagued me almost like monomania\".[10] Hausdorff saw a new strategy to attack the problem in the set \n\n\n\n\nc\na\nr\nd\n\n(\nT\n(\n\n\u2135\n\n0\n\n\n)\n)\n=\n\u2135\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {card} (T(\\aleph _{0}))=\\aleph }\n\n. Cantor had suspected \n\n\n\n\u2135\n=\n\n\u2135\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\aleph =\\aleph _{1}}\n\n, but had only been able to show that \n\n\n\n\u2135\n\u2265\n\n\u2135\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\aleph \\geq \\aleph _{1}}\n\n. While \n\n\n\n\n\u2135\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\aleph _{1}}\n\n is the \"number\" of possible well-orderings of a countable set, \n\n\n\n\u2135\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\aleph }\n\n had now emerged as the \"number\" of all possible orders of such an amount. It was natural, therefore, to study systems that are more specific than orders, but more general than well-orderings. Hausdorff did just that in his first volume of 1901, with the publication of theoretical studies of \"graded sets\". However, we know from the results of Kurt G\u00f6del and Paul Cohen that this strategy to solve the continuum problem is just as ineffectual as Cantor's strategy, which was aimed at generalizing the Cantor\u2013Bendixson principle from closed sets to general uncountable sets./nIn 1904 Hausdorff published the recursion named after him, which states that for each non-limit ordinal \n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu }\n\n we have \n\n\n\n\n\u2135\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n\n\u2135\n\n\u03b1\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\u2135\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n\n\n\u2135\n\n\u03bc\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\u2135\n\n\u03b1\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\aleph _{\\mu }^{\\aleph _{\\alpha }}=\\aleph _{\\mu }\\;\\aleph _{\\mu -1}^{\\aleph _{\\alpha }}.}/nThis formula was, together with a later notion called cofinality introduced by Hausdorff, the basis for all further results for Aleph exponentiation. Hausdorff's excellent knowledge of recurrence formulas of this kind also empowered him to uncover an error in Julius K\u00f6nig's lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1904 in Heidelberg. There K\u00f6nig had argued that the continuum cannot be well-ordered, so its cardinality is not an Aleph at all, and thus caused a great stir. The fact that it was Hausdorff who clarified the mistake carries a special significance, since a false impression of the events in Heidelberg lasted for over 50 years.[11]/nIn the years 1906\u20131909 Hausdorff did his groundbreaking and fundamental work on ordered sets. Of fundamental importance to the whole theory is the concept of cofinality, which Hausdorff introduced. An ordinal is called regular if it is cofinal with any smaller ordinal; otherwise it is called singular. Hausdorff's question, whether there are regular numbers which index a limit ordinal, was the starting point for the theory of inaccessible cardinals. Hausdorff had already noticed that such numbers, if they exist, must be of \"exorbitant size\".[12]/nThe following theorem due to Hausdorff is also of fundamental importance: for each unbounded and ordered dense set \n\n\n\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A}\n\n there are two uniquely determined regular initial numbers \n\n\n\n\n\u03c9\n\n\u03be\n\n\n,\n\n\u03c9\n\n\u03b7\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\omega _{\\xi },\\omega _{\\eta }}\n\n so that \n\n\n\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A}\n\n is cofinal with \n\n\n\n\n\u03c9\n\n\u03be\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\omega _{\\xi }}\n\n and coinitial with \n\n\n\n\n\u03c9\n\n\u03b7\n\n\n\u2217\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\omega _{\\eta }^{*}}\n\n (where * denotes the inverse order). This theorem provides, for example, a technique to characterize elements and gaps in ordered sets./nIf \n\n\n\nW\n\n\n{\\displaystyle W}\n\n is a predetermined set of characters (element and gap characters), the question arises whether there are ordered sets whose character set is exactly \n\n\n\nW\n\n\n{\\displaystyle W}\n\n. One can easily find a necessary condition for \n\n\n\nW\n\n\n{\\displaystyle W}\n\n, but Hausdorff was also able to show that this condition is sufficient. For this one needs a rich reservoir of ordered sets, which Hausdorff was also able to create with his theory of general products and powers.[13] In this reservoir can be found interesting structures like the Hausdorff \n\n\n\n\n\u03b7\n\n\u03b1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\eta _{\\alpha }}\n\n normal-types, in connection with which Hausdorff first formulated the generalized continuum hypothesis. Hausdorff's \n\n\n\n\n\u03b7\n\n\u03b1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\eta _{\\alpha }}\n\n-sets formed the starting point for the study of the important model theory of saturated structure.[14]/nHausdorff's general products and powers of cardinalities led him to study the concept of partially ordered set. The question of whether any ordered subset of a partially ordered set is contained in a maximal ordered subset was answered in the positive by Hausdorff using the well-ordering theorem. This is the Hausdorff maximal principle, which follows from either the well-ordering theorem or the axiom of choice, and as it turned out, is also equivalent to the axiom of choice.[15]/nWriting in 1908, Arthur Moritz Schoenflies found in his report on set theory that the newer theory of ordered sets (i.e., that which occurred after Cantor's extensions) was almost exclusively due to Hausdorff.[16]/nAccording to previous notions, set theory included not only the general set theory and the theory of sets of points, but also dimension and measure theory. Hausdorff's textbook was the first to present all of set theory in this broad sense, systematically and with full proofs. Hausdorff was aware of how easily the human mind can err while also seeking for rigor and truth, so in the preface of his work he promises:/n\u2026 to be as economical as possible with the human privilege of error./nThis book went far beyond its masterful portrayal of already-known concepts. It also contained a series of important original contributions by the author./nThe first few chapters deal with the basic concepts of general set theory. In the beginning Hausdorff provides a detailed set algebra with some pioneering new concepts (differences chain, set rings and set fields, \n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\delta }\n\n- and \n\n\n\n\u03c3\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\sigma }\n\n-systems). The introductory paragraphs on sets and their connections included, for example, the modern set-theoretic notion of functions. Chapters 3 to 5 discussed the classical theory of cardinal numbers, order types and ordinals, and in the sixth chapter \"Relations between ordered and well-ordered sets\" Hausdorff presents, among other things, the most important results of his own research on ordered sets./nIn the chapters on \"point sets\"\u2014the topological chapters\u2014Hausdorff developed for the first time, based on the known neighborhood axioms, a systematic theory of topological spaces, where in addition he added the separation axiom later named after him. This theory emerges from a comprehensive synthesis of earlier approaches of other mathematicians and Hausdorff's own reflections on the problem of space. The concepts and theorems of classical point set theory \n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}}\n\n are\u2014as far as possible\u2014transferred to the general case, and thus become part of the newly created general or set-theoretic topology. But Hausdorff not only performed this \"translation work\", but he also developed basic construction methods of topology such as core formation (open core, self-dense core) and shell formation (closure), and he works through the fundamental importance of the concept of an open set (called \"area\" by him) and of the concept of compactness introduced by Fr\u00e9chet. He also founded and developed the theory of the connected set, particularly through the introduction of the terms \"component\" and \"quasi-component\"./nWith the first Hausdorff countability axiom, and eventually the second, the considered spaces were gradually further specialized. A large class of spaces satisfying the countable first axiom are metric spaces. They were introduced in 1906 by Fr\u00e9chet under the name \"classes (E)\". The term \"metric space\" comes from Hausdorff. In Principles, he developed the theory of metric spaces and systematically enriched it through a series of new concepts: Hausdorff metric, complete, total boundedness, \n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\rho }\n\n-connectivity, reducible sets. Fr\u00e9chet's work is not particularly famous; only through Hausdorff's Principles did metric spaces become common knowledge to mathematicians./nThe chapter on illustrations and the final chapter of Principles on measure and integration theory are enriched by the generality of the material and the originality of presentation. Hausdorff's mention of the importance of measure theory for probability had great historical effect, despite its laconic brevity. One finds in this chapter the first correct proof of the strong law of large numbers of \u00c9mile Borel. Finally, the appendix contains the single most spectacular result of the whole book, namely Hausdorff's theorem that one cannot define a volume for all bounded subsets of \n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}}\n\n for \n\n\n\nn\n\u2265\n3\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n\\geq 3}\n\n. The proof is based on Hausdorff's paradoxical ball decomposition, whose production requires the axiom of choice.[17]/nDuring the 20th century, it became the standard to build mathematical theories on axiomatic set theory. The creation of axiomatically-founded generalized theories, such as general topology, served among other things to single out the common structural core for various specific cases or regions and then set up an abstract theory, which contained all these parts as special cases. This brought a great success in the form of simplification and harmonization, and ultimately brought with itself an economy of thought. Hausdorff himself highlighted this aspect in the Principles. In the topological chapter, the basic concepts are methodologically a pioneering effort, and they paved the way for the development of modern mathematics./nPrinciples of set theory appeared in April 1914, on the eve of the First World War, which dramatically affected scientific life in Europe. Under these circumstances, the effects Hausdorff's book on mathematical thought would not be seen for five to six years after its appearance. After the war, a new generation of young researchers set forth to expand on the abundant suggestions that were included in this work. Undoubtedly, topology was the primary focus of attention. The journal Fundamenta Mathematicae, founded in Poland in 1920, played a special role in the reception of Hausdorff's ideas. It was one of the first mathematical journals with special emphasis on set theory, topology, the theory of real functions, measure and integration theory, functional analysis, logic, and foundations of mathematics. Across this spectrum, a special focus was placed on topology. Hausdorff's Principles was cited in the very first volume of Fundamenta Mathematicae, and through citation counting its influence continued at a remarkable rate. Of the 558 works (Hausdorff's own three works not included), which appeared in the first twenty volumes of Fundamenta Mathematicae from 1920 to 1933, 88 of them cite Principles. One must also take into account the fact that, as Hausdorff's ideas became increasingly commonplace, so too were they used in a number of works that did not cite them explicitly./nThe Russian topological school, founded by Paul Alexandroff and Paul Urysohn, was based heavily on Hausdorff's Principles. This is shown by the surviving correspondence in Hausdorff's Nachlass with Urysohn, and especially Alexandroff and Urysohn's M\u00e9moire sur les multiplicit\u00e9s Cantoriennes,[18] a work the size of a book, in which Urysohn developed dimension theory and Principles is cited no fewer than 60 times./nAfter the Second World War there was a strong demand for Hausdorff's book, and there were three reprints at Chelsea from 1949, 1965 and 1978./nIn 1916, Alexandroff and Hausdorff independently solved[19] the continuum problem for Borel sets: Every Borel set in a complete separable metric space is either countable or has the cardinality of the continuum. This result generalizes the Cantor\u2013Bendixson theorem that such a statement holds for the closed sets of \n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}}\n\n. For linear \n\n\n\n\nG\n\n\u03b4\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G_{\\delta }}\n\n sets William Henry Young had proved the result in 1903,[20] for \n\n\n\n\nG\n\n\u03b4\n\u03c3\n\u03b4\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G_{\\delta \\sigma \\delta }}\n\n sets Hausdorff obtained a corresponding result in 1914 in Principles. The theorem of Alexandroff and Hausdorff was a strong impetus for further development of descriptive set theory.[21]/nAmong the publications of Hausdorff in his time at Greifswald the work Dimension and outer measure from 1919 is particularly outstanding. In this work, the concepts were introduced which are now known as Hausdorff measure and the Hausdorff dimension. It has remained highly topical and in later years has been one of the most cited mathematical works from the decade of 1910 to 1920./nThe concept of Hausdorff dimension is useful for the characterization and comparison of \"highly rugged quantities\". The concepts of Dimension and outer measure have experienced applications and further developments in many areas such as in the theory of dynamical systems, geometric measure theory, the theory of self-similar sets and fractals, the theory of stochastic processes, harmonic analysis, potential theory, and number theory.[22]/nSignificant analytical work of Hausdorff occurred in his second time at Bonn. In Summation methods and moment sequences I in 1921, he developed a whole class of summation methods for divergent series, which today are called Hausdorff methods. In Hardy's classic Divergent Series, an entire chapter is devoted to the Hausdorff method. The classical methods of H\u00f6lder and Ces\u00e0ro proved to be special cases of the Hausdorff method. Every Hausdorff method is given by a moment sequence; in this context Hausdorff gave an elegant solution of the moment problem for a finite interval, bypassing the theory of continued fractions. In his paper Moment problems for a finite interval of 1923 he treated more special moment problems, such as those with certain restrictions for generating density \n\n\n\n\u03c6\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\varphi (x)}\n\n, for instance \n\n\n\n\u03c6\n(\nx\n)\n\u2208\n\nL\n\np\n\n\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\varphi (x)\\in L^{p}[0,1]}\n\n. Criteria for solvability and decidability of moment problems occupied Hausdorff for many years, as hundreds of pages of handwritten notes in his Nachlass attest.[23]/nA significant contribution to the emerging field of functional analysis in the 1920s was Hausdorff's extension of the Riesz-Fischer theorem to \n\n\n\n\nL\n\np\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L^{p}}\n\n spaces in his 1923 work An extension of Parseval's theorem on Fourier series. He proved the inequalities now named after him and W.H. Young. The Hausdorff\u2013Young inequalities became the starting point of major new developments.[24]/nHausdorff's book Set Theory appeared in 1927. This was declared as a second Edition of Principles, but it was actually a completely new book. Since the scale was significantly reduced due to its appearance in Goschen's teaching library, large parts of the theory of ordered sets and measures and integration theory were removed. In its preface, Hausdorff writes, \"Perhaps even more than these deletions the reader will regret the most that, to further save space in point set theory, I have abandoned the topological point of view through which the first edition has apparently acquired many friends, and focused on the simpler theory of metric spaces\"./nIn fact, this was an explicit regret of some reviewers of the work. As a kind of compensation Hausdorff showed for the first time the then-current state of descriptive set theory. This fact assured the book almost as intense a reception as Principles, especially in Fundamenta Mathematicae. As a textbook it was very popular. In 1935 there was an expanded edition published, and this was reprinted by Dover in 1944. An English translation appeared in 1957 with reprints in 1962 and 1967./nThere was also a Russian edition (1937), although it was only partially a faithful translation, and partly a reworking by Alexandroff and Kolmogorov. In this translation the topological point of view again moved to the forefront. In 1928 a review of Set Theory was written by Hans Hahn, who perhaps had the danger of German antisemitism in his mind as he closed his discussion with the following sentence:/nAn exemplary depiction in every respect of a difficult and thorny area, a work on par with those which have carried the fame of German science throughout the world, and such that all German mathematicians may be proud of.[25]/nIn 1938, Hausdorff's last work Extension of a continuous map showed that a continuous function from a closed subset \n\n\n\nF\n\n\n{\\displaystyle F}\n\n of a metric space \n\n\n\nE\n\n\n{\\displaystyle E}\n\n can be extended to all of \n\n\n\nE\n\n\n{\\displaystyle E}\n\n (although the image may need to be extended). As a special case, every homeomorphism from \n\n\n\nF\n\n\n{\\displaystyle F}\n\n can be extended to a homeomorphism from \n\n\n\nE\n\n\n{\\displaystyle E}\n\n. This work continued research from earlier years. In 1919, in About semi-continuous functions and their generalization, Hausdorff had, among other things, given another proof of the Tietze extension theorem. In 1930, in Extending a homeomorphism, he showed the following: Let \n\n\n\nE\n\n\n{\\displaystyle E}\n\n be a metric space, \n\n\n\nF\n\u2286\nE\n\n\n{\\displaystyle F\\subseteq E}\n\n a closed subset. If \n\n\n\nF\n\n\n{\\displaystyle F}\n\n is given a new metric without changing the topology, this metric can be extended to the entire space without changing the topology. The work Graded spaces appeared in 1935, where Hausdorff discussed spaces which fulfilled the Kuratowski closure axioms up to the axiom of idempotence. These spaces are often also called closure spaces, and Hausdorff used them to study relationships between the Fr\u00e9chet limit spaces and topological spaces./nThe name Hausdorff is found throughout mathematics. Among others, these concepts were named after him:/nIn the universities of Bonn and Greifswald, these things were named in his honor:/nBesides these, in Bonn there is the Hausdorffstra\u00dfe (Hausdorff Street), where he first lived. (Haus-Nr.\u00a061). In Greifswald there is a Felix-Hausdorff\u2013Stra\u00dfe, where the Institutes for Biochemistry and Physics are located, among others.

His life was devoted to the study of geometry and reforming advanced mathematical teaching in Italy. He worked on algebraic curves and algebraic surfaces, particularly through his paper Introduzione ad una teoria geometrica delle curve piane (\"Introduction to a geometrical theory of the plane curves\"), and was a founder of the Italian school of algebraic geometry.[1]/nLuigi Cremona was born in Pavia (Lombardy), then part of the Austrian-controlled Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia. His youngest brother was the painter Tranquillo Cremona.[2]/nIn 1848, when Milan and Venice rose against Austria, Cremona, then only seventeen, joined the ranks of the Italian volunteers. He remained with them, fighting on behalf of his country's freedom, until, in 1849, the capitulation of Venice put an end to the campaign.[3]/nHe then returned to Pavia, where he pursued his studies at the university under Francesco Brioschi, and determined to seek a career as teacher of mathematics. He graduated in 1853 as dottore negli studi di ingegnere civile e architetto./nCremona is noted for the important role he played in bringing about the great geometrical advances in Italy. While, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Italy had very little mathematical standing, the end of the century found Italy in the lead along geometric lines, largely as a result of the work of Cremona. He was very influential in bringing about reforms in the secondary schools of Italy and became a leader in questions of mathematical pedagogy as well as in those relating to the advancement of knowledge. The mathematical advances which Italy made since the middle of the nineteenth century were largely guided by Cremona, Brioschi, and Beltrami.[4]/nHis first appointment was as elementary mathematical master at the gymnasium and lyceum of Cremona, and he afterwards obtained a similar post at Milan. In 1860 he was appointed to the professorship of higher geometry at the University of Bologna, and in 1866 to that of higher geometry and graphical statics at the higher technical college of Milan. In this same year he competed for the Steiner Prize of the Berlin Academy, with a treatise entitled Memoria sulle superfici del terzo ordine, and shared the award  with J. C. F. Sturm. Two years later the same prize was conferred on him without competition.[3]/nAs early as 1856 Cremona had begun to contribute to the Annali di scienze matematiche e fisiche, and to the Annali di matematica, of which he became afterwards joint editor. Papers by him appeared in the mathematical journals of Italy, France, Germany and England, and he published several important works, many of which have been translated into other languages. His manual Graphical Statics and his Elements of Projective Geometry (translated by Thomas Hudson Beare and C. Leudesdorf respectively) were published in English by the Clarendon Press./nIn 1873 he was called to Rome to organize the Royal College of Engineering, and was also appointed professor of higher mathematics at the university.[5] Cremona's reputation had now become European, and in 1879 he was elected a corresponding member of the Royal Society. In the same year he became a member of the senate of the Kingdom of Italy. In 1898 he was briefly minister for education.[6] The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences elected Cremona as member in 1901.

While studying at the Carol I High School in Craiova, he contributed to the school's magazine, writing the columns on mathematics and studies of literary critique. After graduation in 1892,[1] he obtained a scholarship at the preparatory school in Bucharest, where he also was admitted as a student in the Mathematics Department of University of Bucharest's Faculty of Sciences.

His bibliography includes over 200 published papers and books, which appeared in many editions.[8] Carrying on the researches of the American geometer of German origin Ernest Wilczynski, \u021ai\u021beica discovered a new class of surfaces and a new class of curves which now carry his name. His contributions represent the beginning of a new chapter in mathematics, namely, affine differential geometry.[3] He also studied webs in n-dimensional space, defined through Laplace equations. He investigated what is now known as the Tzitzeica equation, which was further generalized by Robin Bullough and Roger Dodd (the Tzitz\u00e9ica\u2013Bullough\u2013Dodd equation)./nHe is also known for a result on the geometry of circles and triangles in the plane, referred to as \u021ai\u021beica's 5 lei coin problem\u00a0[ro], a problem he proposed (and solved) at the Gazeta Matematic\u0103\u00a0[ro] contest in Gala\u021bi in 1908.[9] The problem was posed independently by Roger Arthur Johnson in 1916, and the resulting configuration is also referred to as the Johnson circles./n\u021ai\u021beica married Florence Thierin (1882\u20131965) and the couple had three children \u2014 Radu (1905\u20131987), Gabriela (1907\u20131987), and \u0218erban (1908\u20131985) \u2014 all of whom pursued careers in academia;[10][11] the youngest one became a renowned quantum physicist.

As a black female in America during the 1950s she faced heavy adversity throughout her career and was often underrepresented and disregarded.  Despite these barriers Easley demonstrated perseverance and determination to make a name for herself in a line of work dominated by males. She demonstrated exceptional skills in mathematics, data analysis, and code development across projects focused on alternative energy sources, improved power systems, and launch capabilities enabling space communication and exploration./nEasley was born April 23, 1933, in Birmingham, Alabama to Samuel Bird Easley and Mary Malvina Hoover. She was raised by her mother and her brother who was six years older than her./nIn her early years, she aspired to be a nurse, but switched to pharmaceuticals when she began high school. Before the civil rights movement, education for black communities was extremely limited. Segregation was prevalent everywhere in society and black children were not offered the same opportunities as white children. Inspired by her mother to follow her dreams, set goals and work hard at them, Easley dedicated herself to her studies. She graduated valedictorian of Holy Family Highschool and enrolled in Xavier University in New Orleans. Four years later she got married and moved to Cleveland where she would continue to puruse a career in pharmaceuticals which would prove improbable. The next year, she divorced and moved back to Birmingham to be near her family. Being recently divorced and out of work after recently moving back home, Annie was constanlty on the search for work. However, Jim Crow laws were still in place during this time and black people were required to take literacy tests and pay poll taxes. Easley would help many members of her community to pass these tests and receive ultimately find jobs./nIn 1955, Easley would read a story in the local newspaper highlighting twin sisters working at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) as \"human computers.\" She applied for a job which required strong mathematical skills and despite not having a college degree, her highschool record indicated a strong work ethic convinced her future employers. Two weeks after sending in her application she began her 34 year long career as a computer scientist and mathematician. Four years later, in 1958, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was formed from NACA and Easley was one of 4 black employees out of a total of over 2500./nEasley's earl work involved running simulations at NASA's Plum Brook Reactor Facility and studying the effects of rocket launches on earth's ozone layer. She taught herself assembly programming using languages like Formula Translating System (Fortran) and the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) to help with these simluations. She would also work on developing code used in researching and analyzing alternative power technologies like batteries and fuel systems, which would be later used in hybrid vehicles and NASA's Centaur upper-stage rocket./nThroughout her lifetime Easley continued to show generosity to others, commendable work ethic and a determination to redefine the role of black communities in American society. Despite her humble claims of not aspiring to be hero and a leader, she retired in 1989 as true innovator and rolemodel./nBefore the Civil Rights Movement, educational and career opportunities for African-American children were very limited. Segregation was prevalent, African-American children were educated separately from white children, and their schools were often inferior to white schools. Annie's mother told her that she could be anything, but she would have to work at it. She encouraged Annie to get a good education. From the fifth grade through high school, Annie attended Holy Family High School, and was valedictorian of her graduating class.[1] At a young age Annie had interest in becoming a nurse, but around the age of 16 she decided to study pharmacy.[2]/nIn 1950, Easley enrolled in classes at Xavier University in New Orleans,[3] an African-American Catholic university, and majored in pharmacy for about two years.[1]/nIn 1977, she obtained a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Cleveland State University.[4][5]/nIn 1955, Easley read a story in a local newspaper about twin sisters who worked for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) as \"computers\".[6] She applied for a job the next day, and was hired two weeks later - one of four African Americans out of about 2500 employees. She began her career as computer at the NACA Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory (which became NASA Lewis Research Center, 1958\u20131999, and subsequently the John H. Glenn Research Center) in Cleveland, Ohio.[7] Later after electronic computers started being used at NASA her title changed to mathematician and computer technician. Even with a degree, at NASA, Easley also had to complete internal specialization courses to be considered a professional. Easley was denied financial aid that other employees received for education, without explanation from the agency.[8] She also noted that she did not feel that her pay was very high when she first started with two years of college. Although she was promised a GS-3 in her interview, her first paycheck was a GS-2, and when she questioned it she was told there were no more GS-3s available.[2]/nEasley's outreach for minorities did not end with her volunteer work at college career days. At NASA she took upon herself to be an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) counselor. This was one of the formal ways that she helped her supervisors at NASA address discrimination complaints from all levels.[9] She was also part of a recruitment effort on behalf of NASA for engineering students from numerous colleges.[2]/nHer 34-year career included developing and implementing computer code that analyzed alternative power technologies, supported the Centaur high-energy upper rocket stage, determined solar, wind and energy projects, and identified energy conversion systems and alternative systems to solve energy problems.[10] During the 1970s Easley worked on a project examining damage to the ozone layer. With massive cuts in the NASA space program, Easley began working on energy problems; her energy assignments included studies to determine the life use of storage batteries, such as those used in electric utility vehicles. Her computer applications have been used to identify energy conversion systems that offer the improvement over commercially available technologies. Following the energy crisis of the late 1970s Easley studied the economic advantages of co-generating power plants that obtained byproducts from coal and steam.[11] After retiring in 1989, she remained an active participant in the Speaker's Bureau and the Business & Professional Women's association.[7] Despite her long career and numerous contributions to research, she was cut out of NASA's promotional photos. In response to one such event, Easley responded by saying \"I'm out here to do a job and I knew I had the ability to do it, and that's where my focus was, on getting the job done. I was not intentionally trying to be a pioneer.\" which showed that she placed her work and solving problems before everything else.[8]/nEasley's work with the Centaur project helped lay the technological foundations for future space shuttle launches and launches of communication, military and weather satellites.[3][7] Her work contributed to the 1997 flight to Saturn of the Cassini probe, the launcher of which had the Centaur as its upper stage.[7]/nAnnie Easley was interviewed in Cleveland on August 21, 2001, by Sandra Johnson.[2] The interview is stored in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Johnson Space Center Oral History Program. The 55 page interview transcript includes material on the history of the Civil Rights Movement, Glenn Research Center, Johnson Space Center, space flight, and the contribution of women to space flight. In that same Interview, Easley was asked whether she still played with gadgets and stated \"I don't have the time or the desire. I will get the email and I'll send it, but I don't play with it. It's not like this fascinating thing I play with. I'd much rather be out doing something actively, like on the golf course or doing other things.\"[5]/nEasley lived in a time where women and African-Americans were facing discrimination from society, although she prided herself in her work ethic and achieved her goals nonetheless.  She also experienced some discrimination related to being an African-American during her career, especially with the picture-cutting incident at her work, when her face was cut out from a picture to put it on display. In her 34-year career she worked in four different departments: the Computer Services Division, the Energy Directorate, the Launch Vehicles Group and the Engineering Directorate, although none of her moves were due to promotions, which she recognized may have been due to her race or sex.[2]/nThroughout the 1970s, Easley advocated for and encouraged female and minority students at college career days to work in STEM careers.[12] She tutored elementary and high school children as well as young adults who had dropped out of school in a work-study program.[5]/nEasley was also a budding athlete who founded and subsequently became the first President of the NASA Lewis Ski Club and participated in other local ski clubs in the Cleveland area.[13][2]/nAnnie Easley was born to Samuel Bird Easley and Mary Malvina Hoover in Birmingham, Alabama.[13] She was raised by her mother and had a brother six years her senior.[2]/nIn 1954, Annie Easley married a man from the military. After her husband had been discharged from the military, the two of them moved to Cleveland, Ohio to be near his family.[5][8]/nShe had the intention of continuing her studies in Cleveland, but unfortunately, the local university had ended its pharmacy program a short time before and no nearby alternative existed.[5]/nAfter divorcing her husband, Easley returned to Birmingham. As part of the Jim Crow laws that maintained racial inequality, African Americans were required to pass a literacy test and pay a poll tax in order to vote, which was outlawed in 1964 in the Twenty-fourth Amendment. She remembered the test giver looking at her application and saying only, \"You went to Xavier University. Two dollars.\"  Subsequently, she helped other African-Americans prepare for the test.[14]/nEasley had always loved dressing up. She wore stockings and heels almost every day in college. Although there was no dress code in her work department, wearing pants as a woman during that time was still not normalized. However, she was one of the first to wear pants to work in the 1970s after talking to her supervisor about it.[2]/nIn her first three years after retiring from NASA, Easley focused on volunteer work, often telling people she put more miles on her car as a retiree than as a worker. She traveled the world, mostly to ski, and become an independent contractor in real estate. Although she no longer tutored, she expressed that she was always willing to talk to students at career days and similar events if asked.[2]", "70494973": "Sina Ruth Greenwood is a New Zealand mathematician whose interests include continuum theory, discrete dynamical systems, inverse limits, set-valued analysis, and Volterra spaces.[1][2] She is an associate professor of mathematics and Associate Dean Pacific in the faculty of science at the University of Auckland.[1]/nGreenwood's parents emigrated from Samoa to Whanganui in New Zealand, shortly before Greenwood was born; they moved from there to Auckland when she was a child.

Using this information it was now possible to find a solution to the problem of the duplication of the cube by solving for the points at which two parabolas intersect, a solution equivalent to solving a cubic equation.[4]/nThere are few direct sources for Menaechmus's work; his work on conic sections is known primarily from an epigram by Eratosthenes, and the accomplishment of his brother (of devising a method to create a square equal in area to a given circle using the quadratrix), Dinostratus, is known solely from the writings of Proclus.

He was born in Marthon, near Angoul\u00eame./nIn 1680, Tachard went to the Caribbean (Antilles) with Jean II d'Estr\u00e9es./nTachard was involved in embassies to Siam, which came as responses to embassies sent by the Siamese King Narai to France in order to obtain an alliance against the Dutch.[2]/nTachard was sent in 1685 with five other Jesuits under Superior Jean de Fontaney, on a first French embassy to Siam led by Chevalier de Chaumont and Fran\u00e7ois-Timol\u00e9on de Choisy, and accompanied by Claude de Forbin. The objective of the Jesuits was to complete a scientific expedition to the Indies and China.[3] Enticed by the Greek Constantine Phaulkon, he returned to France to suggest an alliance with the king of Siam Narai to Louis XIV./nThe five other Jesuits Fathers continued to China where they arrived in February 1688: Jean de Fontaney (1643\u20131710), Joachim Bouvet (1656\u20131730), Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gerbillon (1654\u20131707), Louis Le Comte (1655\u20131728) and Claude de Visdelou (1656\u20131737).[4]/nThe two ships of the embassy returned to France with a Siamese embassy on board, led by the Siamese ambassador Kosa Pan,[5] who was bringing a proposal for an eternal alliance between France and Siam. The embassy stayed in France from June 1686 to March 1687./nA second embassy to Siam was sent in March 1687.[6] organized by Colbert, of which Tachard was part again. The embassy consisted in five warships, led by General Desfarges, and was bringing the Siamese embassy home./nThe mission was led by Simon de la Loub\u00e8re and Claude C\u00e9beret du Boullay, director of the French East India Company. A young Jesuit had been brought by Tachard: the future composer Andr\u00e9 Cardinal Destouches.[7] However, apart from the reaffirmation of the 1685 commercial treaty, the mission achieved little else. The disambarkment of French troops in Bangkok and Mergui led to strong nationalistic movements in Siam directed by Phra Petratcha and ultimately resulted in the 1688 Siamese revolution in which king Narai died, Phaulkon was executed, and Phra Petratcha became king. Desfarges negotiated to return with his men to Pondicherry. In the later part of 1689, Desfarges captured the island of Phuket in an attempt to restore French control.[8]/nMeanwhile, Tachard returned to France with the title of \"Ambassador Extraordinary for the King of Siam\", accompanied by Ok-khun Chamnan, and visited the Vatican in January 1688. He and his Siamese embassy met with Pope Innocent XI and translated Narai's letter to him./nIn 1690, when Tachard tried to return to Siam, a revolution had happened, King Narai was already dead and a new king was on the throne. Tachard had to stop at Pondicherry and return to France without obtaining a permission to enter the country./nIn 1699, Tachard again went to Siam, and managed to enter the country this time.

Clavius would later write defences and an explanation of the reformed calendar, including an emphatic acknowledgement of Lilius' work. In his last years he was probably the most respected astronomer in Europe and his textbooks were used for astronomical education for over fifty years in and even out of Europe.[2]/nLittle is known about Clavius' early life other than the fact that he was born in Bamberg in either 1538 or 1537.[3] His given name is not known to any great degree of certainty\u2014it is thought by scholars to have perhaps been Christoph Clau or Klau. There are also some who think that his taken name, Clavius, may be a Latinization of his original German name, suggesting that his name may have been Schl\u00fcssel (German for 'key', which is clavis in Latin)./nClavius joined the Jesuit order in 1555. He attended the University of Coimbra in Portugal, where it is possible that he had some kind of contact with the famous mathematician Pedro Nunes (Petrus Nonius). Following this he went to Italy and studied theology at the Jesuit Collegio Romano in Rome. He was ordained in 1564, and 15 years later was assigned to compute the basis for a reformed calendar that would stop the slow process in which the Church's holidays were drifting relative to the seasons of the year. Using the Prussian Tables of Erasmus Reinhold and building on the work of Aloysius Lilius, he proposed a calendar reform that was adopted in 1582 in Catholic countries by order of Pope Gregory XIII and is now the Gregorian calendar used worldwide./nWithin the Jesuit order, Clavius was almost single-handedly responsible for the adoption of a rigorous mathematics curriculum in an age where mathematics was often ridiculed by philosophers as well as fellow Jesuits like Benito Pereira.[4] In logic, Clavius' Law (inferring of the truth of a proposition from the inconsistency of its negation) is named after him./nHe used the decimal point in the goniometric tables of his astrolabium in 1593 and he was one of the first who used it in this way in the West.[5][6]/nClavius wrote a commentary on the most important astronomical textbook of the late Middle Ages, De Sphaera of Johannes de Sacrobosco. The commentary by Clavius was one of the most influential astronomy textbooks of its time and had at least 16 editions between 1570 and 1618, with Clavius himself revising the text seven times and in each case greatly expanding it.[7]\nIn the 1585 edition of his aforementioned commentary he located (independently of Tycho Brahe) the nova from 1572 in the fixed stars sphere (in the constellation of Cassiopeia) and found that the position of the nova was exactly the same for all observers. That meant that it had to be beyond the Moon, and the doctrine that the heavens could not change was proven false.[8]/nAs an astronomer Clavius held strictly to the geocentric model of the solar system, in which all the heavens rotate about the Earth. Though he opposed the heliocentric model of Copernicus, he recognized problems with the Ptolemaic model. He was treated with great respect by Galileo, who visited him in 1611 and discussed the new observations being made with the telescope; Clavius had by that time accepted the new discoveries as genuine,[9] though he retained doubts about the reality of the mountains on the Moon and said he could not see the four Jupiter's satellites through the telescope.[10] Later, a large crater on the Moon was named in his honor./nDuring his time at Collegio Romano Clavius served as the head of the mathematicians, a public professor of mathematics, and as the Director of Advanced Instruction and Research at the Academy of Mathematics until 1610 in an official capacity and for two more years until 1612 in an informal role.[11] The Academy existed in an informal capacity for many years before Clavius arrived in Rome in 1561. However, in 1580 in his document titled Ordo servandus in addiscendis disciplinis mathematicis, Clavius described a detailed curriculum for mathematics to have the College officially recognize the Academy.[11]/nThe curriculum he proposed contained three different curricula aiming to educate new Jesuits in mathematics. The curriculum contained three different courses: one year, a two-year, and a three-year. The course material to be covered were optics, statics, astronomy, and acoustics,[11] emphasizing mathematics./nHis request was eventually denied, but  nonetheless he was given the title of Professor of mathematics. Clavius made another attempt in 1586 to establish the Academy as an official course at the Collegio Romano, but there was opposition from the philosophers at the College. The Academy remained an unofficial curriculum until 1593 or 1594./nUpon its eventual founding, the Academy required nomination by the Professor of mathematics for admission. Clavius taught the advanced course within the Academy, but little is known about his specific teachings and work as a professor during his time at the College. The exact number of students that Clavius taught is unclear, but in a letter from Christoph Grienberger to Clavius in 1595, it is stated that at that time, Clavius had around ten students.[11] The exact structure of the courses and how they were taught is unclear. There has been no evidence to show whether the students he taught shared classes or the specific material he chose to cover. The purpose for founding the Academy was to train technical specialists,[11] to expand the pedagogical corps to support the growing need for professors, as the number of colleges at the time was rapidly increasing,[11] as well as the training of missionaries in order to support their efforts in remote places.[11] With the purpose of the Academy clear, most of what Clavius and his students did in the Academy is unknown. This lack of detailed information has led to most of what Clavius did during his years at the College falling into obscurity./nClavius and Galileo Galilei often shared correspondence during his time at the College, discussing proofs and theories. It is likely that while running the Academy, he was also writing to Galileo and sharing his notes from the College's logic course to help Galileo in his endeavors to be able to adequately explain and demonstrate his ideas to others, which is something Galileo had struggled with in the past, specifically when trying to convince Clavius of his methods.[12]/nFollowing his death in 1612, informal courses in the Academy continued at the College. However, due to the lack of mention of mathematicians in the College's catalog after 1615, it appears the Academy's official recognition by the Collegio Romano ended soon after Christopher Clavius's death.[11]/nClavius' complete mathematical works (5 volumes, Mainz, 1611\u20131612) are available online .", "2337582": "Hua Luogeng or Hua Loo-Keng (Chinese: \u534e\u7f57\u5e9a; Wade\u2013Giles: Hua Lo-keng; 12 November 1910 \u2013 12 June 1985) was a Chinese mathematician and politician famous for his important contributions to number theory and for his role as the leader of mathematics research and education in the People's Republic of China. He was largely responsible for identifying and nurturing the renowned mathematician Chen Jingrun who proved Chen's theorem, the best known result on the Goldbach conjecture. In addition, Hua's later work on mathematical optimization and operations research made an enormous impact on China's economy. He was elected a foreign associate of the US National Academy of Sciences in 1982.[1]  He was elected a member of the standing Committee of the first to sixth National people's Congress, Vice-Chairman of the sixth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (April 1985) and Vice-Chairman of the China Democratic League (1979). He joined the Communist Party of China in 1979./nHua did not receive a formal university education. Although awarded several honorary PhDs, he never got a formal degree from any university. In fact, his formal education only consisted of six years of primary school and three years of secondary school. For that reason, Xiong Qinglai, after reading one of Hua's early papers, was amazed by Hua's mathematical talent, and in 1931 Xiong invited him to study mathematics at Tsinghua University./nHua Luogeng was born in Jintan, Jiangsu on 12 November, 1910. Hua's father was a small businessman. Hua met a capable math teacher in middle school who recognized his talent early and encouraged him to read advanced texts. After middle school, Hua enrolled in Chinese Vocational College in Shanghai, and there he distinguished himself by winning a national abacus competition. Although tuition fees at the college were low, living costs proved too high for his means, and Hua was forced to leave a term before graduating. After failing to find a job in Shanghai, Hua returned home in 1927 to help in his father's store. In 1929, Hua contracted typhoid fever and was in bed for half a year. The culmination of Hua's illness resulted in the partial paralysis of his left leg, which impeded his movement quite severely for the rest of his life./nAfter middle school, Hua continued to study mathematics independently with the few books he had, and studied the entire high school and early undergraduate math curriculum. By the time Hua returned to Jintan, he was already engaged in independent mathematics research, and his first publication Some Researches on the Theorem of Sturm, appeared in the December 1929 issue of the Shanghai periodical Science. In the following year Hua showed in a short note in the same journal that a certain 1926 paper claiming to have solved the quintic was fundamentally flawed. Hua's lucid analysis caught the eye of Prof. Xiong Qinglai at Tsinghua University in Beijing, and in 1931 Hua was invited, despite his lack of formal qualification and not without some reservations on the part of several faculty members, to join the mathematics department there./nAt Tsinghua, Hua began as a clerk in the library, and then moved to become an assistant in mathematics. By September 1932, he was an instructor, and two years later, after having published another dozen papers, he was promoted to the rank of lecturer./nDuring 1935\u201336 Jacques Hadamard and Norbert Wiener visited Tsinghua, and Hua eagerly attended the lectures of both and created a good impression. Wiener visited England soon afterward and spoke of Hua to G. H. Hardy. In this way Hua received an invitation to come to Cambridge, England, where he stayed for two years./nWhile at Cambridge University, Hua worked on applying the Hardy\u2013Littlewood circle method towards problems in number theory. He produced seminal work on Waring's problem, which would establish his reputation within the international math community. In 1938, after the full outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Hua chose to return to China to Tsinghua, where he was appointed full professor despite not having any degree. At the time, with vast areas of China under Japanese occupation, Tsinghua University, Peking University, and Nankai University had merged into the Southwest Associated University in Kunming, capital of the southern province Yunnan. In spite of the hardships of poverty, enemy bombings, and relative academic isolation from the rest of the world, Hua continued to produce first-rate mathematics. During his eight years there, Hua studied Vinogradov's seminal method of estimating trigonometric sums and reformulated it in sharper form, in what is now known universally as Vinogradov's mean value theorem. This famous result is central to improved versions of the Hilbert\u2013Waring theorem, and has important applications to the study of the Riemann zeta function. Hua wrote up this work in a booklet titled Additive Theory of Prime Numbers that was accepted for publication in Russia as early as 1940, but owing to the war, did not appear in expanded form until 1947 as a monograph of the Steklov Institute. In the closing years of the Kunming period, Hua turned his interests to algebra and analysis towards which he soon began to make original contributions./nAfter the war, Hua spent three months in the Soviet Union in the spring of 1946, at Ivan Vinogradov's invitation, following which Hua departed for Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton University. At Princeton, Hua worked on matrix theory, functions of several complex variables, and group theory. At this time civil war was raging in China and it was not easy to travel, and for \"convenience of travel,\" the Chinese authorities had assigned Hua the rank of general in his passport./nIn the spring of 1948, Hua accepted appointment as full professor at the University of Illinois Urbana\u2013Champaign. However, his stay in Illinois was far too brief. In October 1949, the People's Republic of China was established, and Hua, wanting to be part of a new epoch, decided to return to China with his wife and kids, despite having settled comfortably in the United States./nBack in China, Hua threw himself into educational reform and the organization of mathematical activity at the graduate level, in the schools, and among workers in the burgeoning industry. In July 1952 the Mathematical Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) came into being, with Hua as its first director. The following year he was one of a 26-member delegation from CAS to visit the Soviet Union in order to establish links with Russian science. Later, he was the first Chair of the Department of Mathematics and Vice President of University of Science & Technology of China (USTC), a new type of Chinese university established by CAS in 1958, which was aimed at fostering skilled researchers necessary for the economic development, defense and education in science and technology./nDespite his many teaching and administrative duties, Hua remained active in research and continued to write, not only on topics that had engaged him before but also in areas that were new to him or had been only lightly touched on before. In 1956, his voluminous text, Introduction to Number Theory, appeared, and later it was published in English by Springer. Harmonic Analysis of Functions of Several Complex Variables in the Classical Domains came out in 1958 and was translated into Russian in the same year, followed by an English translation by the American Mathematical Society in 1963./nOutside of pure math, Hua first proposed in 1952 the development of China's electronic computer, and in early 1953, an initial research team for this project was formed under Hua's leadership by the Mathematical Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences./nThe start of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 came with a vehement attack on pure mathematics and intellectuals,[citation needed] which prompted Hua to shift towards applied mathematics. Hua developed, with Wang Yuan, a broad interest in linear programming, operations research, and multidimensional numerical integration. In connection with the last of these, the study of the Monte Carlo method and the role of uniform distribution led them to invent an alternative deterministic method based on ideas from algebraic number theory. Their theory was set out in Applications of Number Theory to Numerical Analysis, which was published much later, in 1978, and by Springer in English translation in 1981. The newfound interest in applicable mathematics took him in the 1960s, accompanied by a team of assistants, all over China to show workers of all kinds how to apply their reasoning faculty to the solution of shop-floor and everyday problems. Whether in ad hoc problem-solving sessions in factories or open-air teachings, he touched his audiences with the spirit of mathematics to such an extent that he became a national hero and even earned an unsolicited letter of commendation from Mao Zedong, this last a valuable protection in uncertain times. Hua had a commanding presence, a genial personality, and a wonderful way of putting things simply, and the impact of his travels spread his fame and the popularity of mathematics across the land./nFollowing the Cultural Revolution, Hua resumed contact with Western mathematicians. In 1980 Hua became a cultural ambassador of China charged with re-establishing links with Western academics, and during the next five years he travelled extensively in Europe, the United States, and Japan. In 1979 he was a visiting research fellow of the then Science Research Council of the United Kingdom at the University of Birmingham and during 1983\u201384 he was Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Scholar at the California Institute of Technology. He died of a heart attack at the end of a lecture he gave in Tokyo on 12 June 1985./nHua Luogeng Park in Jintan, Jiangsu has been named after him.", "34777908": "Vatroslav Berti\u0107 (7 June 1818 \u2013 1901) was a Croatian mathematician./nBerti\u0107 was born in Orehovica.

His father was Robert Keill, an Edinburgh lawyer. His mother was Sarah Cockburn.  His brother, James Keill, became a noted physician./nKeill studied at Edinburgh University under David Gregory.  In 1692, he obtained his bachelor's degree with a distinction in physics and mathematics. Keill then attended Balliol College, Oxford, obtaining an MA on 2 February 1694. After being appointed a lecturer in experimental philosophy at Hart Hall, Keill started giving lectures and performing experiments based on Newton's findings.  He instructed his students on the laws of motion, the principles of hydrostatics and optics, and Newtonian propositions on light and colours./nIn 1698. Keill published Examination of Dr. Burnet's Theory of the Earth.  His volume contained scientific attacks on Burnet, Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, Thomas Hobbes and Nicolas Malebranche. This publication, along with his teaching, gained Keill notice in the English academic community. In 1700, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.  However, after failing to get an academic appointment at Oxford in 1709, Keill left the university to seek a government position./nIn 1709, Keill was appointed treasurer of a charitable fund to resettle war refugees from the German states. He accompanied at least one group of German refugees to the British Province of New York./nIn 1711, Keill accepted the position of decypherer to Anne, Queen of Great Britain. His responsibilities included explaining old manuscripts to the sovereign.   In 1712, Keill returned to Oxford as Savilian Professor of Astronomy.  On 9 July 1713, he was awarded the DM degree.[2]/nIn his later years, Keill became involved in the controversy regarding Gottfried Leibniz's alleged plagiarisation of Newton's invention of calculus, serving as Newton's chief defender. However, Newton himself eventually grew tired of Keill as he stirred up too much trouble./nIn 1717, Keill married Mary Clements, a woman 25 years his junior and the daughter of an Oxford bookbinder. The marriage created great scandal at the time as Clements was from a lower class.[3]/nOn 31 August 1721, Keill died in London from a sudden illness, possibly food poisoning.  It was stated in the old Dictionary of National Biography that Keill left no will. His will is referenced in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography and is held by The National Archives.[4][3] It was executed on 12 January 1720 and was proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury in October 1721. He spent \u00a3500 to his household furniture and plate to his wife and his books, instruments and other money in trust for his son./nKeill's publisher at Oxford, Henry Clements, sometimes bound Keill's Trigonometriae and Logarithmorum with Federico Commandino's translation of Euclid's Elements.

He is often called William Bourne of Gravesend./nIn 1574, he produced a popular version of the Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s de Albacar's Arte de Navegar, entitled A Regiment for the Sea. Bourne was critical of some aspects of the original and produced a manual of more practical use to the seaman. He described how to make observations of the sun and stars, using a cross-staff, and how to plot coastal features from the ship by taking bearings using triangulation.[1]/nBefore publishing his submarine design, William Bourne was a jurat in Gravesend, England. His name first appears in the first charter of incorporation of Gravesend from June 5, 1562. His name appears once again as a jurat in the second charter of Gravesend, June 5, 1568. During the time of the second charter, the only records of regulations for trading in Gravesend are written in Bourne's handwriting. This would imply that he held an office such as clerk of the market. He also worked as an innkeeper during this time, one of fourteen in the town of Gravesend.[2]/nHis design, detailed in his book Inventions or Devises published in 1578, was one of the first recorded plans for an underwater navigation vehicle. He designed an enclosed craft capable of submerging by decreasing the overall volume (rather than flooding chambers as in modern submarines), and being rowed underwater. Bourne described a ship with a wooden frame covered in waterproofed leather, but the description was a general principle rather than a detailed plan. However, the concept of an underwater rowing boat was eventually put into action by the Dutchman Cornelius Drebbel in 1620, and Nathaniel Symons demonstrated a 'sinking boat' in 1729 using the expanding and contracting volume of the boat to submerge./nThe submarine was the subject of a modern-day recreation on season 3 of \"The Re-Inventors\" TV show, episode \"Bourne Submarine\". The recreation had limited functionality before it sank when water pressure ruptured some membranes on a test descent.[3]/nInventions or Devises, published in 1578, is one of William Bourne's more important works. This book gives many guides and instructional tools for sailors, mostly concerning interactions with other ships. The 21st device listed is the earliest known description of a ship's log and line, which he attributes to Humprey Cole, an officer of the Tower Mint.[1] The 75th device on the list is a description of a night signal or early semaphore system to be used between people on distant ships who had previously decided on a code consisting of a series of lights and fashion of standing./nThe 110th entry is what seems to be a type of telescope. The device was said to have been employed by mathematician and surveyor Leonard Digges and Bourne was asked to investigate it by Queen Elizabeth I's chief advisor Lord Burghley. Bourne's is the best description of it, and from his writing it seemed to consist of peering into a large curved mirror that reflected the image produced by a large lens (Bourne noted in his report that the device worked but had a very narrow field of view, making impractical in military applications).[4] This \"backwards\" reflecting telescope predates the earliest known working telescope by 30 years but its unwieldy nature seems to have kept it from being developed.[5]", "1649527": "Richard C. Schroeppel (born 1948) is an American mathematician born in Illinois. His research has included magic squares, elliptic curves, and cryptography. In 1964, Schroeppel won first place in the United States among over 225,000 high school students in the Annual High School Mathematics Examination, a contest sponsored by the Mathematical Association of America and the Society of Actuaries.[1] In both 1966 and 1967, Schroeppel scored among the top 5 in the U.S. in the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition.[2] In 1973 he discovered that there are 275,305,224 normal magic squares of order 5.[3] In 1998\u20131999 he designed the Hasty Pudding Cipher, which was a candidate for the Advanced Encryption Standard, and he is one of the designers of the SANDstorm hash, a submission to the NIST SHA-3 competition./nAmong other contributions, Schroeppel was the first to recognize the sub-exponential running time of certain integer factoring algorithms.

This improvement doubled the size of numbers that could be factored in a given amount of time.

Kaluza himself was born in Wilhelmsthal (a village that was incorporated into Oppeln (presently Opole) in 1899).

He entered the University of K\u00f6nigsberg to study mathematics and gained his doctorate with a thesis on Tschirnhaus transformations. Kaluza was primarily a mathematician but began studying relativity. In April 1919 Kaluza noticed that when he solved Albert Einstein's equations for general relativity using five dimensions, then Maxwellian equations for electromagnetism resulted spontaneously.[1][2][3] Kaluza wrote to Einstein who, in turn, encouraged him to publish. Kaluza's theory was published in 1921 in a paper \"Zum Unit\u00e4tsproblem der Physik\" with Einstein's support in Sitzungsberichte Preu\u00dfische Akademie der Wissenschaften 966\u2013972 (1921).[2]/nKaluza's insight is remembered as the Kaluza\u2013Klein theory (named also after physicist Oskar Klein). However, the work was neglected for many years, as attention was directed towards quantum mechanics. His idea that fundamental forces can be explained by additional dimensions was not reused until string theory was developed. It is, however, also notable that many of the aspects of this body of work were already published in 1914 by Gunnar Nordstr\u00f6m, but his work also went unnoticed and was not recognized when the ideas were reused./nFor the rest of his career Kaluza continued to produce ideas about relativity and about models of the atomic nucleus.

He is considered a reviver of projective geometry, and his work Trait\u00e9 des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s projectives des figures is considered the first definitive text on the subject since G\u00e9rard Desargues' work on it in the 17th century. He later wrote an introduction to it: Applications d'analyse et de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie.[3]/nAs a mathematician, his most notable work was in projective geometry, although an early collaboration with Charles Julien Brianchon provided a significant contribution to Feuerbach's theorem. He also made discoveries about projective harmonic conjugates; relating these to the poles and polar lines associated with conic sections. He developed the concept of parallel lines meeting at a point at infinity and defined the circular points at infinity that are on every circle of the plane. These discoveries led to the principle of duality, and the principle of continuity and also aided in the development of complex numbers.[3]/nAs a military engineer, he served in Napoleon's campaign against the Russian Empire in 1812, in which he was captured and held prisoner until 1814. Later, he served as a professor of mechanics at the \u00c9cole d'application in his home town of Metz, during which time he published Introduction \u00e0 la m\u00e9canique industrielle, a work he is famous for, and improved the design of turbines and water wheels. In 1837, a tenured 'Chaire de m\u00e9canique physique et exp\u00e9rimentale' was specially created for him at the Sorbonne (the University of Paris).[4] In 1848, he became the commanding general of his alma mater, the \u00c9cole Polytechnique.[3] He is honoured by having his name listed among notable French engineers and scientists displayed around the first stage of the Eiffel tower./nPoncelet was born in Metz, France, on 1 July 1788, the illegitimate then legitimated [5] son of Claude Poncelet, a lawyer of the Parliament of Metz and wealthy landowner.[6] His mother, Anne-Marie Perrein, had a more modest background. [7] At a young age, he was sent to live with the Olier family at Saint-Avold.[8] He returned to Metz for his secondary education, at Lyc\u00e9e Fabert.[6] After this, he attended the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, a prestigious school in Paris, from 1808 to 1810, though he fell behind in his studies in his third year due to poor health.[6] After graduation, he joined the Corps of Military Engineers. He attended the \u00c9cole d'application in his hometown during this time, and achieved the rank of lieutenant in the French Army the same year he graduated.[9]/nPoncelet took part in Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812. His biographer Didion writes that he was part of the group which was cut from Marshal Michel Ney's army at the Battle of Krasnoi and was forced to capitulate to the Russians,[10] though other sources say that he was left for dead.[6] Upon capture, he was interrogated by General Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich, but he did not disclose any information.[11] The Russians held him as a prisoner of war and confined him at Saratov.[12] During his imprisonment, in the years 1812\u20131814, he wrote his most notable work, Trait\u00e9 des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s projectives des figures, which outlined the foundations of projective geometry, as well as some new results. Poncelet, however, could not publish it until after his release in 1814.[3]/nIn 1815, the year after his release, Poncelet was employed a military engineer at his hometown of Metz. In 1822, while at this position, he published Trait\u00e9 des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s projectives des figures. This was the first major work to discuss projective geometry since Desargues', though Gaspard Monge had written a few minor works about it previously. It is considered the founding work of modern projective geometry.[9] Joseph Diaz Gergonne also wrote about this branch of geometry at approximately the same time, beginning in 1810. Poncelet published several papers about the subject in Annales de Gergonne (officially known as Annales de math\u00e9matiques pures et appliqu\u00e9es).[3] However, Poncelet and Gergonne ultimately engaged in a bitter priority dispute over the Principle of Duality.[9]/nIn 1825, he became the professor of mechanics at the \u00c9cole d'Application in Metz, a position he held until 1835. During his tenure at this school, he improved the design of turbines and water wheels, deriving his work from the mechanics of the Proven\u00e7al mill from southern France.[13] Although the turbine of his design was not constructed until 1838, he envisioned such a design twelve years previous to that.[3] In 1835, he left \u00c9cole d'Application, and in December 1837 became a tenured professor at Sorbonne (the University of Paris), where a 'Chaire de m\u00e9canique physique et exp\u00e9rimentale' was specially created for him with the support of Fran\u00e7ois Arago.[14]/nIn 1848, Poncelet became the Commanding General of his alma mater, the \u00c9cole Polytechnique.[15] He held the position until 1850, when he retired./nDuring this time, he wrote Applications d'analyse et de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie, which served as an introduction to his earlier work Trait\u00e9 des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s projectives des figures. It was published in two volumes in 1862 and 1864.[16] He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1865.[17]/nPoncelet discovered the following theorem in 1822: Euclidean compass and straightedge constructions can be carried out using only a straightedge if a single circle and its center is given. Swiss mathematician Jakob Steiner proved this theorem in 1833, leading to the name of the theorem. The constructions that this theorem states are possible are known as Steiner constructions.[18]/nIn geometry, Poncelet's porism (sometimes referred to as Poncelet's closure theorem) states that whenever a polygon is inscribed in one conic section and circumscribes another one, the polygon must be part of an infinite family of polygons that are all inscribed in and circumscribe the same two conics.[19][20]", "59779989": "Aurelie or Aur\u00e9lie Thiele is a French engineering and decision-making professor.

According to Jamie Gumbrecht in an article by CNN:/nThey handed out its punch cards as souvenirs. They'd taught the massive machine do math that would've taken hours by hand. [...] But their work during the war was little known, unacknowledged or left out of official histories of the war and the development of computers.[5]/nThe film focuses on the contributions of several women, namely  the Blumberg twins, Doris Polsky (n\u00e9e Blumberg) and Shirley Melvin (n\u00e9e Blumberg); Marlyn Meltzer (n\u00e9e Wescoff); and Jean Bartik (a.k.a. Billie Jean Jennings). Kathleen Antonelli (n\u00e9e McNulty) is another ENIAC computer programmer recognized in the film.

Nonetheless, many may come away from the film thinking that before World War II women not only did not work as computers or mathematicians but they also thought themselves incapable of doing such work.

After the Second World War, Good continued to work with Turing on the design of computers and Bayesian statistics at the University of Manchester. Good moved to the United States where he was professor at Virginia Tech./nHe was born Isadore Jacob Gudak to a Polish Jewish family in London. He later anglicised his name to Irving John Good and signed his publications \"I. J. Good.\"/nAn originator of the concept now known as \"intelligence explosion,\" Good served as consultant on supercomputers to Stanley Kubrick, director of the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey.[3]/nGood was born Isadore Jacob Gudak to Polish Jewish parents in London. His father was a watchmaker, who later managed and owned a successful fashionable jewellery shop, and was also a notable Yiddish writer writing under the pen name of Moshe Oved. Good was educated at the Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, at the time in Hampstead in northwest London, where, according to Dan van der Vat, Good effortlessly outpaced the mathematics curriculum.[3]/nGood studied mathematics at Jesus College, Cambridge, graduating in 1938 and winning the Smith's Prize in 1940.[4] He did research under G. H. Hardy and Abram Besicovitch before moving to Bletchley Park in 1941 on completing his doctorate./nOn 27 May 1941, having just obtained his doctorate at Cambridge, Good walked into Hut 8, Bletchley's facility for breaking German naval ciphers, for his first shift. This was the day that Britain's Royal Navy destroyed the German battleship\u00a0Bismarck after it had sunk the Royal Navy's HMS\u00a0Hood. Bletchley had contributed to Bismarck's destruction by discovering, through wireless-traffic analysis, that the German flagship was sailing for Brest, France, rather than Wilhelmshaven, from which she had set out.[3]\nHut 8 had not, however, been able to decrypt on a current basis the 22 German Naval Enigma messages that had been sent to Bismarck.  The German Navy's Enigma cyphers were considerably more secure than those of the German Army or Air Force, which had been well penetrated by 1940. Naval messages were taking three to seven days to decrypt, which usually made them operationally useless for the British. This was about to change, however, with Good's help.[3]/nAlan Turing... had caught Good sleeping on the floor while on duty during his first night shift. At first, Turing thought Good was ill, but he was cross when Good explained that he was just taking a short nap because he was tired. For days afterwards, Turing would not deign to speak to Good, and he left the room if Good walked in. The new recruit only won Turing's respect after he solved the bigram tables problem. During a subsequent night shift, when there was no more work to be done, it dawned on Good that there might be another chink in the German indicating system. The German telegraphists had to add dummy letters to the trigrams which they selected out of the kenngruppenbuch... Good wondered if their choice of dummy letters was random, or whether there was a bias towards particular letters. After inspecting some messages which had been broken, he discovered that there was a tendency to use some letters more than others. That being the case, all the codebreakers had to do, was to work back from the indicators given at the beginning of each message, and apply each bigram table in turn in the same way as Joan Clarke had done before. The bigram table which produced one of the popular dummy letters was probably the correct one. When Good mentioned his discovery to Alan Turing, Turing was very embarrassed, and said, 'I could have sworn that I tried that.' It quickly became an important part of the Banburismus procedure.\nJack Good's refusal to go on working when tired was vindicated by a subsequent incident. During another long night shift, he had been baffled by his failure to break a doubly enciphered Offizier message. This was one of the messages which was supposed to be enciphered initially with the Enigma set up in accordance with the Offizier settings, and subsequently with the general Enigma settings in place. However, while he was sleeping before returning for another shift, he dreamed that the order had been reversed; the general settings had been applied before the Offizier settings. Next day he found that the message had yet to be read, so he applied the theory which had come to him during the night. It worked; he had broken the code in his sleep.[5]/nGood served with Turing for nearly two years.[3] Subsequently, he worked with Donald Michie in Max Newman's group on the Fish ciphers, leading to the development of the Colossus computer.[citation needed]/nGood was a member of the Bletchley Chess Club which defeated the Oxford University Chess Club 8\u20134 in a twelve-board team match held on 2 December 1944. Good played fourth board for Bletchley Park, with Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander, Harry Golombek and James Macrae Aitken in the top three spots.[6] He won his game against Sir Robert Robinson.[7]/nIn 1947, Newman invited Good to join him and Turing at Manchester University. There, for three years, Good lectured in mathematics and researched computers, including the Manchester Mark 1.[3]/nIn 1948, Good was recruited back to the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). He remained there until 1959, while also taking up a brief associate professorship at Princeton University and a short consultancy with IBM.[3]/nFrom 1959 until he moved to the US in 1967, Good held government-funded positions and from 1964 a senior research fellowship at Trinity College, Oxford, and the Atlas Computer Laboratory, where he continued his interests in computing, statistics and chess.[2] He later left Oxford, declaring it \"a little stiff\"./nIn 1967, Good moved to the United States, where he was appointed a research professor of statistics at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.

Kass and Raftery[11] credit Good (and in turn Turing) with coining the term Bayes factor. Good published a number of books on probability theory. In 1958, he published an early version of what later became known as the fast Fourier transform[12] but it did not become widely known. He played chess to county standard and helped popularise Go, an Asian boardgame, through a 1965 article in New Scientist (he had learned the rules from Alan Turing).[13] In 1965, he originated the concept now known as \"intelligence explosion\" or the \"technological singularity\", which anticipates the eventual advent of superhuman intelligence:/nLet an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an 'intelligence explosion,' and the intelligence of man would be left far behind... Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control. It is curious that this point is made so seldom outside of science fiction. It is sometimes worthwhile to take science fiction seriously.[14][15]/nGood's authorship of treatises such as his 1965 \"Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine\"[16] and \"Logic of Man and Machine\"[17] made him the obvious person for Stanley Kubrick to consult when filming 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), one of whose principal characters was the paranoid HAL 9000 supercomputer.[3] In 1995, Good was elected a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[2] Graphcore's proposed foundation model $600m computer, that uses Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, which will have the potential capacity of running programs with 500trn parameters, was named to honor Good's intellectual heritage.[18][Notes 1][19] According to The Economist, Graphcore aims to take the \"first step\" towards creating I.

His most notable works are Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and its sequel Through the Looking-Glass (1871). He was noted for his facility with word play, logic, and fantasy. His poems Jabberwocky (1871) and The Hunting of the Snark (1876) are classified in the genre of literary nonsense./nCarroll came from a family of high-church Anglicans, and developed a long relationship with Christ Church, Oxford, where he lived for most of his life as a scholar and teacher. Alice Liddell \u2013 a daughter of Henry Liddell, the Dean of Christ Church \u2013 is widely identified as the original inspiration for Alice in Wonderland, though Carroll always denied this./nAn avid puzzler, Carroll created the word ladder puzzle (which he then called \"Doublets\"), which he published in his weekly column for Vanity Fair magazine between 1879 and 1881. In 1982 a memorial stone to Carroll was unveiled at Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey. There are societies in many parts of the world dedicated to the enjoyment and promotion of his works.[1][2]/nDodgson's family was predominantly northern English, conservative, and high-church Anglican. Most of his male ancestors were army officers or Anglican clergymen. His great-grandfather, Charles Dodgson, had risen through the ranks of the church to become the Bishop of Elphin in rural Ireland.[3] His paternal grandfather, another Charles, had been an army captain, killed in action in Ireland in 1803, when his two sons were hardly more than babies.[4] The older of these sons, yet another Charles Dodgson, was Carroll's father. He went to Westminster School and then to Christ Church, Oxford.[5] He reverted to the other family tradition and took holy orders. He was mathematically gifted and won a double first degree, which could have been the prelude to a brilliant academic career. Instead, he married his first cousin Frances Jane Lutwidge in 1830 and became a country parson.[6][7]/nDodgson was born on 27 January 1832 at All Saints' Vicarage in Daresbury, Cheshire,[8] the oldest boy and the third oldest of 11 children. When he was 11, his father was given the living of Croft-on-Tees, Yorkshire, and the whole family moved to the spacious rectory. This remained their home for the next 25 years. Charles' father was an active and highly conservative cleric of the Church of England who later became the Archdeacon of Richmond[9] and involved himself, sometimes influentially, in the intense religious disputes that were dividing the church. He was high-church, inclining toward Anglo-Catholicism, an admirer of John Henry Newman and the Tractarian movement, and did his best to instil such views in his children. However, Charles developed an ambivalent relationship with his father's values and with the Church of England as a whole.[10]/nDuring his early youth, Dodgson was educated at home. His \"reading lists\" preserved in the family archives testify to a precocious intellect: at the age of seven, he was reading books such as The Pilgrim's Progress. He also spoke with a stammer \u2013 a condition shared by most of his siblings[11] \u2013 that often inhibited his social life throughout his years. At the age of twelve he was sent to Richmond Grammar School (now part of Richmond School) in Richmond, North Yorkshire./nIn 1846, Dodgson entered Rugby School, where he was evidently unhappy, as he wrote some years after leaving: \"I cannot say ... that any earthly considerations would induce me to go through my three years again ... I can honestly say that if I could have been ... secure from annoyance at night, the hardships of the daily life would have been comparative trifles to bear.\"[12] He did not claim he suffered from bullying, but cited little boys as the main targets of older bullies at Rugby.[13] Stuart Dodgson Collingwood, Dodgson's nephew, wrote that \"even though it is hard for those who have only known him as the gentle and retiring don to believe it, it is nevertheless true that long after he left school, his name was remembered as that of a boy who knew well how to use his fists in defence of a righteous cause\", which is the protection of the smaller boys.[13]/nScholastically, though, he excelled with apparent ease. \"I have not had a more promising boy at his age since I came to Rugby\", observed mathematics master R. B. Mayor.[14] Francis Walkingame's The Tutor's Assistant; Being a Compendium of Arithmetic \u2013 the mathematics textbook that the young Dodgson used \u2013 still survives and it contained an inscription in Latin, which translates to: \"This book belongs to Charles Lutwidge Dodgson: hands off!\"[15] Some pages also included annotations such as the one found on p.\u00a0129, where he wrote \"Not a fair question in decimals\" next to a question.[16]/nHe left Rugby at the end of 1849 and matriculated at the University of Oxford in May 1850 as a member of his father's old college, Christ Church.[17] After waiting for rooms in college to become available, he went into residence in January 1851.[18] He had been at Oxford only two days when he received a summons home. His mother had died of \"inflammation of the brain\" \u2013 perhaps meningitis or a stroke \u2013 at the age of 47.[18]/nHis early academic career veered between high promise and irresistible distraction. He did not always work hard, but was exceptionally gifted, and achievement came easily to him. In 1852, he obtained first-class honours in Mathematics Moderations and was soon afterwards nominated to a Studentship by his father's old friend Canon Edward Pusey.[19][20] In 1854, he obtained first-class honours in the Final Honours School of Mathematics, standing first on the list, and thus graduated as Bachelor of Arts.[21][22] He remained at Christ Church studying and teaching, but the next year he failed an important scholarship exam through his self-confessed inability to apply himself to study.[23][24] Even so, his talent as a mathematician won him the Christ Church Mathematical Lectureship in 1855,[25] which he continued to hold for the next 26 years.[26] Despite early unhappiness, Dodgson remained at Christ Church, in various capacities, until his death, including that of Sub-Librarian of the Christ Church library, where his office was close to the Deanery, where Alice Liddell lived.[27]/nThe young adult Charles Dodgson was about 6 feet (1.83\u00a0m) tall and slender, and he had curly brown hair and blue or grey eyes (depending on the account). He was described in later life as somewhat asymmetrical, and as carrying himself rather stiffly and awkwardly, although this might be on account of a knee injury sustained in middle age. As a very young child, he suffered a fever that left him deaf in one ear. At the age of 17, he suffered a severe attack of whooping cough, which was probably responsible for his chronically weak chest in later life. In early childhood, he acquired a stammer, which he referred to as his \"hesitation\"; it remained throughout his life.[27]/nThe stammer has always been a significant part of the image of Dodgson. While one apocryphal story says that he stammered only in adult company and was free and fluent with children, there is no evidence to support this idea.[28] Many children of his acquaintance remembered the stammer, while many adults failed to notice it. Dodgson himself seems to have been far more acutely aware of it than most people whom he met; it is said that he caricatured himself as the Dodo in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, referring to his difficulty in pronouncing his last name, but this is one of the many supposed facts often repeated for which no first-hand evidence remains. He did indeed refer to himself as a dodo, but whether or not this reference was to his stammer is simply speculation.[27]/nDodgson's stammer did trouble him, but it was never so debilitating that it prevented him from applying his other personal qualities to do well in society. He lived in a time when people commonly devised their own amusements and when singing and recitation were required social skills, and the young Dodgson was well equipped to be an engaging entertainer. He could reportedly sing at a passable level and was not afraid to do so before an audience. He was also adept at mimicry and storytelling, and reputedly quite good at charades.[27]/nIn the interim between his early published writings and the success of the Alice books, Dodgson began to move in the pre-Raphaelite social circle. He first met John Ruskin in 1857 and became friendly with him. Around 1863, he developed a close relationship with Dante Gabriel Rossetti and his family. He would often take pictures of the family in the garden of the Rossetti's house in Chelsea, London. He also knew William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais, and Arthur Hughes, among other artists. He knew fairy-tale author George MacDonald well \u2013 it was the enthusiastic reception of Alice by the young MacDonald children that persuaded him to submit the work for publication.[27][29]/nIn broad terms, Dodgson has traditionally been regarded as politically, religiously, and personally conservative. Martin Gardner labels Dodgson as a Tory who was \"awed by lords and inclined to be snobbish towards inferiors\".[30] William Tuckwell, in his Reminiscences of Oxford (1900), regarded him as \"austere, shy, precise, absorbed in mathematical reverie, watchfully tenacious of his dignity, stiffly conservative in political, theological, social theory, his life mapped out in squares like Alice's landscape\".[31] Dodgson was ordained a deacon in the Church of England on 22 December 1861. In The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll, the editor states that \"his Diary is full of such modest depreciations of himself and his work, interspersed with earnest prayers (too sacred and private to be reproduced here) that God would forgive him the past, and help him to perform His holy will in the future.\"[32] When a friend asked him about his religious views, Dodgson wrote in response that he was a member of the Church of England, but \"doubt[ed] if he was fully a 'High Churchman'\". He added:/nI believe that when you and I come to lie down for the last time, if only we can keep firm hold of the great truths Christ taught us\u2014our own utter worthlessness and His infinite worth; and that He has brought us back to our one Father, and made us His brethren, and so brethren to one another\u2014we shall have all we need to guide us through the shadows. Most assuredly I accept to the full the doctrines you refer to\u2014that Christ died to save us, that we have no other way of salvation open to us but through His death, and that it is by faith in Him, and through no merit of ours, that we are reconciled to God; and most assuredly I can cordially say, \"I owe all to Him who loved me, and died on the Cross of Calvary.\"/nDodgson also expressed interest in other fields. He was an early member of the Society for Psychical Research, and one of his letters suggests that he accepted as real what was then called \"thought reading\".[34] Dodgson wrote some studies of various philosophical arguments. In 1895, he developed a philosophical regressus-argument on deductive reasoning in his article \"What the Tortoise Said to Achilles\", which appeared in one of the early volumes of Mind.[35] The article was reprinted in the same journal a hundred years later in 1995, with a subsequent article by Simon Blackburn titled \"Practical Tortoise Raising\".[36]/nFrom a young age, Dodgson wrote poetry and short stories, contributing heavily to the family magazine Mischmasch and later sending them to various magazines, enjoying moderate success. Between 1854 and 1856, his work appeared in the national publications The Comic Times and The Train, as well as smaller magazines such as the Whitby Gazette and the Oxford Critic. Most of this output was humorous, sometimes satirical, but his standards and ambitions were exacting. \"I do not think I have yet written anything worthy of real publication (in which I do not include the Whitby Gazette or the Oxonian Advertiser), but I do not despair of doing so someday,\" he wrote in July 1855.[27] Sometime after 1850, he did write puppet plays for his siblings' entertainment, of which one has survived: La Guida di Bragia.[37]/nIn March 1856, he published his first piece of work under the name that would make him famous. A romantic poem called \"Solitude\" appeared in The Train under the authorship of \"Lewis Carroll\". This pseudonym was a play on his real name: Lewis was the anglicised form of Ludovicus, which was the Latin for Lutwidge, and Carroll an Irish surname similar to the Latin name Carolus, from which comes the name Charles.[7] The transition went as follows:\n\"Charles Lutwidge\" translated into Latin as \"Carolus Ludovicus\". This was then translated back into English as \"Carroll Lewis\" and then reversed to make \"Lewis Carroll\".[38] This pseudonym was chosen by editor Edmund Yates from a list of four submitted by Dodgson, the others being Edgar Cuthwellis, Edgar U. C. Westhill, and Louis Carroll.[39]/nIn 1856, Dean Henry Liddell arrived at Christ Church, bringing with him his young family, all of whom would figure largely in Dodgson's life over the following years, and would greatly influence his writing career. Dodgson became close friends with Liddell's wife Lorina and their children, particularly the three sisters Lorina, Edith, and Alice Liddell. He was widely assumed for many years to have derived his own \"Alice\" from Alice Liddell; the acrostic poem at the end of Through the Looking-Glass spells out her name in full, and there are also many superficial references to her hidden in the text of both books. It has been noted that Dodgson himself repeatedly denied in later life that his \"little heroine\" was based on any real child,[40][41] and he frequently dedicated his works to girls of his acquaintance, adding their names in acrostic poems at the beginning of the text. Gertrude Chataway's name appears in this form at the beginning of The Hunting of the Snark, and it is not suggested that this means that any of the characters in the narrative are based on her.[41]/nInformation is scarce (Dodgson's diaries for the years 1858\u20131862 are missing), but it seems clear that his friendship with the Liddell family was an important part of his life in the late 1850s, and he grew into the habit of taking the children on rowing trips (first the boy, Harry, and later the three girls) accompanied by an adult friend[42] to nearby Nuneham Courtenay or Godstow.[43]/nIt was on one such expedition on 4 July 1862 that Dodgson invented the outline of the story that eventually became his first and greatest commercial success. He told the story to Alice Liddell and she begged him to write it down, and Dodgson eventually (after much delay) presented her with a handwritten, illustrated manuscript entitled Alice's Adventures Under Ground in November 1864.[43]/nBefore this, the family of friend and mentor George MacDonald read Dodgson's incomplete manuscript, and the enthusiasm of the MacDonald children encouraged Dodgson to seek publication. In 1863, he had taken the unfinished manuscript to Macmillan the publisher, who liked it immediately. After the possible alternative titles were rejected \u2013 Alice Among the Fairies and Alice's Golden Hour \u2013 the work was finally published as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland in 1865 under the Lewis Carroll pen-name, which Dodgson had first used some nine years earlier.[29] The illustrations this time were by Sir John Tenniel; Dodgson evidently thought that a published book would need the skills of a professional artist. Annotated versions provide insights into many of the ideas and hidden meanings that are prevalent in these books.[44][45] Critical literature has often proposed Freudian interpretations of the book as \"a descent into the dark world of the subconscious\", as well as seeing it as a satire upon contemporary mathematical advances.[46][47]/nThe overwhelming commercial success of the first Alice book changed Dodgson's life in many ways.[48][49][50] The fame of his alter ego \"Lewis Carroll\" soon spread around the world. He was inundated with fan mail and with sometimes unwanted attention. Indeed, according to one popular story, Queen Victoria herself enjoyed Alice in Wonderland so much that she commanded that he dedicate his next book to her, and was accordingly presented with his next work, a scholarly mathematical volume entitled An Elementary Treatise on Determinants.[51][52] Dodgson himself vehemently denied this story, commenting \"...\u00a0It is utterly false in every particular: nothing even resembling it has occurred\";[52][53] and it is unlikely for other reasons. As T. B. Strong comments in a Times article, \"It would have been clean contrary to all his practice to identify [the] author of Alice with the author of his mathematical works\".[54][55] He also began earning quite substantial sums of money but continued with his seemingly disliked post at Christ Church.[29]/nLate in 1871, he published the sequel Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There. (The title page of the first edition erroneously gives \"1872\" as the date of publication.[56]) Its somewhat darker mood possibly reflects changes in Dodgson's life. His father's death in 1868 plunged him into a depression that lasted some years.[29]/nIn 1876, Dodgson produced his next great work, The Hunting of the Snark, a fantastical \"nonsense\" poem, with illustrations by Henry Holiday, exploring the adventures of a bizarre crew of nine tradesmen and one beaver, who set off to find the snark. It received largely mixed reviews from Carroll's contemporary reviewers,[57] but was enormously popular with the public, having been reprinted seventeen times between 1876 and 1908,[58] and has seen various adaptations into musicals, opera, theatre, plays and music.[59] Painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti reputedly became convinced that the poem was about him.[29]/nIn 1895, 30 years after the publication of his masterpieces, Carroll attempted a comeback, producing a two-volume tale of the fairy siblings Sylvie and Bruno. Carroll entwines two plots set in two alternative worlds, one set in rural England and the other in the fairytale kingdoms of Elfland, Outland, and others. The fairytale world satirizes English society, and more specifically the world of academia. Sylvie and Bruno came out in two volumes and is considered a lesser work, although it has remained in print for over a century./nIn 1856, Dodgson took up the new art form of photography under the influence first of his uncle Skeffington Lutwidge, and later of his Oxford friend Reginald Southey.[60] He soon excelled at the art and became a well-known gentleman-photographer, and he seems even to have toyed with the idea of making a living out of it in his very early years.[29]/nA study by Roger Taylor and Edward Wakeling exhaustively lists every surviving print, and Taylor calculates that just over half of his surviving work depicts young girls, though about 60% of his original photographic portfolio is now missing.[61] Dodgson also made many studies of men, women, boys, and landscapes; his subjects also include skeletons, dolls, dogs, statues, paintings, and trees.[62] His pictures of children were taken with a parent in attendance and many of the pictures were taken in the Liddell garden because natural sunlight was required for good exposures.[42]/nHe also found photography to be a useful entr\u00e9e into higher social circles.[63] During the most productive part of his career, he made portraits of notable sitters such as John Everett Millais, Ellen Terry, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Julia Margaret Cameron, Michael Faraday, Lord Salisbury, and Alfred Tennyson.[29]/nBy the time that Dodgson abruptly ceased photography (1880, after 24 years), he had established his own studio on the roof of Tom Quad, created around 3,000 images, and become an amateur master of the medium, though fewer than 1,000 images have survived time and deliberate destruction. He stopped taking photographs because keeping his studio working was too time-consuming.[64] He used the wet collodion process; commercial photographers who started using the dry-plate process in the 1870s took pictures more quickly.[65] Popular taste changed with the advent of Modernism, affecting the types of photographs that he produced./nTo promote letter writing, Dodgson invented \"The Wonderland Postage-Stamp Case\" in 1889. This was a cloth-backed folder with twelve slots, two marked for inserting the most commonly used penny stamp, and one each for the other current denominations up to one shilling. The folder was then put into a slipcase decorated with a picture of Alice on the front and the Cheshire Cat on the back.  It intended to organize stamps wherever one stored their writing implements; Carroll expressly notes in Eight or Nine Wise Words about Letter-Writing it is not intended to be carried in a pocket or purse, as the most common individual stamps could easily be carried on their own.  The pack included a copy of a pamphlet version of this lecture.[66][67]/nAnother invention was a writing tablet called the nyctograph that allowed note-taking in the dark, thus eliminating the need to get out of bed and strike a light when one woke with an idea. The device consisted of a gridded card with sixteen squares and a system of symbols representing an alphabet of Dodgson's design, using letter shapes similar to the Graffiti writing system on a Palm device.[68]/nHe also devised a number of games, including an early version of what today is known as Scrabble. Devised some time in 1878, he invented the \"doublet\" (see word ladder), a form of brain-teaser that is still popular today, changing one word into another by altering one letter at a time, each successive change always resulting in a genuine word.[69] For instance, CAT is transformed into DOG by the following steps: CAT, COT, DOT, DOG.[29] It first appeared in the 29 March 1879 issue of Vanity Fair, with Carroll writing a weekly column for the magazine for two years; the final column dated 9 April 1881.[70] The games and puzzles of Lewis Carroll were the subject of Martin Gardner's March 1960 Mathematical Games column in Scientific American./nOther items include a rule for finding the day of the week for any date; a means for justifying right margins on a typewriter; a steering device for a velociman (a type of tricycle); fairer elimination rules for tennis tournaments; a new sort of postal money order; rules for reckoning postage; rules for a win in betting; rules for dividing a number by various divisors; a cardboard scale for the Senior Common Room at Christ Church which, held next to a glass, ensured the right amount of liqueur for the price paid; a double-sided adhesive strip to fasten envelopes or mount things in books; a device for helping a bedridden invalid to read from a book placed sideways; and at least two ciphers for cryptography.[29]/nHe also proposed alternative systems of parliamentary representation. He proposed the so-called Dodgson's method, using the Condorcet method.[71] In 1884, he proposed a proportional representation system based on multi-member districts, each voter casting only a single vote, quotas as minimum requirements to take seats, and votes transferable by candidates through what is now called Liquid democracy.[72]/nWithin the academic discipline of mathematics, Dodgson worked primarily in the fields of geometry, linear and matrix algebra, mathematical logic, and recreational mathematics, producing nearly a dozen books under his real name. Dodgson also developed new ideas in linear algebra (e.g., the first printed proof of the Rouch\u00e9\u2013Capelli theorem),[73][74] probability, and the study of elections (e.g., Dodgson's method) and committees; some of this work was not published until well after his death. His occupation as Mathematical Lecturer at Christ Church gave him some financial security.[75]/nHis work in the field of mathematical logic attracted renewed interest in the late 20th century. Martin Gardner's book on logic machines and diagrams and William Warren Bartley's posthumous publication of the second part of Dodgson's symbolic logic book have sparked a reevaluation of Dodgson's contributions to symbolic logic.[76][77][78] It is recognized that in his Symbolic Logic Part II, Dodgson introduced the Method of Trees, the earliest modern use of a truth tree.[79]/nRobbins' and Rumsey's investigation[80] of Dodgson condensation, a method of evaluating determinants, led them to the alternating sign matrix conjecture, now a theorem./nThe discovery in the 1990s of additional ciphers that Dodgson had constructed, in addition to his \"Memoria Technica\", showed that he had employed sophisticated mathematical ideas in their creation.[81]/nDodgson wrote and received as many as 98,721 letters, according to a special letter register which he devised. He documented his advice about how to write more satisfying letters in a missive entitled \"Eight or Nine Wise Words about Letter-Writing\", published in 1890.[82]/nDodgson's existence remained little changed over the last twenty years of his life, despite his growing wealth and fame. He continued to teach at Christ Church until 1881 and remained in residence there until his death. Public appearances included attending the West End musical Alice in Wonderland (the first major live production of his Alice books) at the  Prince of Wales Theatre on 30 December 1886.[83] The two volumes of his last novel, Sylvie and Bruno, were published in 1889 and 1893, but the intricacy of this work was apparently not appreciated by contemporary readers; it achieved nothing like the success of the Alice books, with disappointing reviews and sales of only 13,000 copies.[84][85]/nThe only known occasion on which he travelled abroad was a trip to Russia in 1867 as an ecclesiastic, together with the Reverend Henry Liddon. He recounts the travel in his \"Russian Journal\", which was first commercially published in 1935.[86] On his way to Russia and back, he also saw different cities in Belgium, Germany, partitioned Poland, and France./nIn his early sixties, Dodgson increasingly suffered from synovitis which eventually prevented him walking and sometimes left him bed-ridden for months.[87]/nDodgson died of pneumonia following influenza on 14 January 1898 at his sisters' home, \"The Chestnuts\", in Guildford in the county of Surrey, just four days before the death of Henry Liddell. He was two weeks away from turning 66 years old. His funeral was held at the nearby St Mary's Church.[88] His body was buried at the Mount Cemetery in Guildford.[29]/nHe is commemorated at All Saints' Church, Daresbury, in its stained glass windows depicting characters from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, erected in 1935[89]/nSome late twentieth-century biographers have suggested that Dodgson's interest in children had an erotic element, including Morton N. Cohen in his Lewis Carroll: A Biography (1995),[90] Donald Thomas in his Lewis Carroll: A Portrait with Background (1995), and Michael Bakewell in his Lewis Carroll: A Biography (1996).\nCohen, in particular, speculates that Dodgson's \"sexual energies sought unconventional outlets\", and further writes:/nWe cannot know to what extent sexual urges lay behind Charles's preference for drawing and photographing children in the nude. He contended the preference was entirely aesthetic. But given his emotional attachment to children as well as his aesthetic appreciation of their forms, his assertion that his interest was strictly artistic is na\u00efve. He probably felt more than he dared acknowledge, even to himself.[91]/nCohen goes on to note that Dodgson \"apparently convinced many of his friends that his attachment to the nude female child form was free of any eroticism\", but adds that \"later generations look beneath the surface\" (p.\u00a0229). He argues that Dodgson may have wanted to marry the 11-year-old Alice Liddell and that this was the cause of the unexplained \"break\" with the family in June 1863,[29] an event for which other explanations are offered. Biographers Derek Hudson and Roger Lancelyn Green stop short of identifying Dodgson as a paedophile (Green also edited Dodgson's diaries and papers), but they concur that he had a passion for small female children and next to no interest in the adult world.[citation needed] Catherine Robson refers to Carroll as \"the Victorian era's most famous (or infamous) girl lover\".[92]/nSeveral other writers and scholars have challenged the evidential basis for Cohen's and others' views about Dodgson's sexual interests. Hugues Lebailly has endeavoured to set Dodgson's child photography within the \"Victorian Child Cult\", which perceived child nudity as essentially an expression of innocence.[93] Lebailly claims that studies of child nudes were mainstream and fashionable in Dodgson's time and that most photographers made them as a matter of course, including Oscar Gustave Rejlander and Julia Margaret Cameron. Lebailly continues that child nudes even appeared on Victorian Christmas cards, implying a very different social and aesthetic assessment of such material. Lebailly concludes that it has been an error of Dodgson's biographers to view his child-photography with 20th- or 21st-century eyes, and to have presented it as some form of personal idiosyncrasy, when it was a response to a prevalent aesthetic and philosophical movement of the time./nKaroline Leach's reappraisal of Dodgson focused in particular on his controversial sexuality. She argues that the allegations of paedophilia rose initially from a misunderstanding of Victorian morals, as well as the mistaken idea \u2013 fostered by Dodgson's various biographers \u2013 that he had no interest in adult women. She termed the traditional image of Dodgson \"the Carroll Myth\". She drew attention to the large amounts of evidence in his diaries and letters that he was also keenly interested in adult women, married and single, and enjoyed several relationships with them that would have been considered scandalous by the social standards of his time. She also pointed to the fact that many of those whom he described as \"child-friends\" were girls in their late teens and even twenties.[94] She argues that suggestions of paedophilia emerged only many years after his death, when his well-meaning family had suppressed all evidence of his relationships with women in an effort to preserve his reputation, thus giving a false impression of a man interested only in little girls. Similarly, Leach points to a 1932 biography by Langford Reed as the source of the dubious claim that many of Carroll's female friendships ended when the girls reached the age of 14.[95]/nIn addition to the biographical works that have discussed Dodgson's sexuality, there are modern artistic interpretations of his life and work that do so as well \u2013 in particular, Dennis Potter in his play Alice and his screenplay for the motion picture Dreamchild, and Robert Wilson in his musical Alice./nDodgson had been groomed for the ordained ministry in the Church of England from a very early age and was expected to be ordained within four years of obtaining his master's degree, as a condition of his residency at Christ Church. He delayed the process for some time but was eventually ordained as a deacon on 22 December 1861 but when the time came a year later to be ordained as a priest, Dodgson appealed to the dean for permission not to proceed. This was against college rules and, initially, Dean Liddell told him that he would have to consult the college ruling body, which would almost certainly have resulted in his being expelled. For unknown reasons, Liddell changed his mind overnight and permitted him to remain at the college in defiance of the rules.[96] Dodgson never became a priest, unique amongst senior students of his time.[citation needed]/nThere is currently no conclusive evidence about why Dodgson rejected the priesthood. Some have suggested that his stammer made him reluctant to take the step because he was afraid of having to preach.[97] Wilson quotes letters by Dodgson describing difficulty in reading lessons and prayers rather than preaching in his own words.[98] although Dodgson did indeed preach in later life, even though not in priest's orders, so it seems unlikely that his impediment was a major factor affecting his choice.[citation needed]  Wilson also points out that the Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, who ordained Dodgson, had strong views against clergy going to the theatre, one of Dodgson's great interests. He was interested in minority forms of Christianity (he was an admirer of F. D. Maurice) and \"alternative\" religions (theosophy).[99] Dodgson became deeply troubled by an unexplained sense of sin and guilt at this time (the early 1860s) and frequently expressed the view in his diaries that he was a \"vile and worthless\" sinner, unworthy of the priesthood and this sense of sin and unworthiness may well have affected his decision to abandon being ordained to the priesthood.[100]/nAt least four complete volumes and around seven pages of text are missing from Dodgson's 13 diaries.[101] The loss of the volumes remains unexplained; the pages have been removed by an unknown hand. Most scholars assume that the diary material was removed by family members in the interests of preserving the family name, but this has not been proven.[102] Except for one page, material is missing from his diaries for the period between 1853 and 1863 (when Dodgson was 21\u201331 years old).[103][104] During this period, Dodgson began experiencing great mental and spiritual anguish and confessing to an overwhelming sense of his own sin. This was also the period of time when he composed his extensive love poetry, leading to speculation that the poems were autobiographical.[105][106]/nMany theories have been put forward to explain the missing material. A popular explanation for one missing page (27 June 1863) is that it might have been torn out to conceal a proposal of marriage on that day by Dodgson to the 11-year-old Alice Liddell. However, there has never been any evidence to suggest this, and a paper suggests evidence to the contrary which was discovered by Karoline Leach in the Dodgson family archive in 1996.[107][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]/nThis paper is known as the \"cut pages in diary\" document. Carroll's nephew Philip Dodgson Jacques reports that he wrote it well after Carroll's death, based on information from his aunts, who destroyed two diary pages, including the one for 27 June 1863. Jacques did not see the pages himself.[108] The summary for 27 June states that Mrs. Liddell told Dodgson there was gossip circulating about him and the Liddell family's governess, as well as about his relationship with \"Ina\", presumably Alice's older sister Lorina Liddell. The \"break\" with the Liddell family that occurred soon after was presumably in response to this gossip.[109][107] Without evidence, Leach suggests an alternative interpretation; Lorina was also the name of Alice Liddell's mother. What is deemed most crucial and surprising is the document seems to imply that Dodgson's break with the family was not connected with Alice at all. Until a primary source is discovered, the events of 27 June 1863 will remain in doubt; however, a 1930 letter from the younger Lorina Liddell to Alice may shed light on the matter. Reporting an interview with an early Dodgson biographer, she wrote:/nI said his manner became too affectionate to you as you grew older, and that mother spoke to him about it, and that offended him so he ceased coming to visit us again \u2013 as one had to find some reason for all intercourse ceasing . . . Mr. D used to take you on his knee . . . I did not say that.[110]/nIn his diary for 1880, Dodgson recorded experiencing his first episode of migraine with aura, describing very accurately the process of \"moving fortifications\" that are a manifestation of the aura stage of the syndrome.[111] There is no clear evidence to show whether this was his first experience of migraine per se or he previously had the far more common form of migraine without aura, although the latter seems most likely, given the fact that migraine most commonly develops in the teens or early adulthood. Another form of migraine aura called Alice in Wonderland syndrome has been named after Dodgson's book of the same name and its titular character because its manifestation can resemble the sudden size-changes in the book. It is also known as micropsia and macropsia, a brain condition affecting the way that objects are perceived by the mind. For example, an affected person may look at a larger object such as a basketball and perceive it as having the size of a golf ball. Some authors have suggested that Dodgson experienced this type of aura and used it as an inspiration in his work, but there is no evidence that he did.[112][113]/nDodgson also had two attacks in which he lost consciousness. He was diagnosed by a Dr. Morshead, Dr. Brooks, and Dr. Stedman, and they believed the attack and a consequent attack to be an \"epileptiform\" seizure (initially thought to be fainting, but Brooks changed his mind). Some have concluded from this that he had this condition for his entire life, but there is no evidence of this in his diaries beyond the diagnosis of the two attacks already mentioned.[111] Some authors, Sadi Ranson in particular, have suggested that Carroll had temporal lobe epilepsy in which consciousness is not always completely lost but altered, and in which the symptoms mimic many of the same experiences as Alice in Wonderland. Carroll had at least one incident in which he suffered full loss of consciousness and awoke with a bloody nose, which he recorded in his diary and noted that the episode left him not feeling himself for \"quite sometime afterward\". This attack was diagnosed as possibly \"epileptiform\" and Carroll himself later wrote of his \"seizures\" in the same diary./nMost of the standard diagnostic tests of today were not available in the nineteenth century. Yvonne Hart, consultant neurologist at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, considered Dodgson's symptoms. Her conclusion, quoted in Jenny Woolf's 2010 The Mystery of Lewis Carroll, is that Dodgson very likely had migraine and may have had epilepsy, but she emphasises that she would have considerable doubt about making a diagnosis of epilepsy without further information.[114]/nThere are societies in many parts of the world dedicated to the enjoyment and promotion of his works and the investigation of his life.[115]/nCopenhagen Street in Islington, north London is the location of the Lewis Carroll Children's Library.[116]/nIn 1982, his great-nephew unveiled a memorial stone to him in Poets' Corner, Westminster Abbey.[117] In January 1994, an asteroid, 6984 Lewiscarroll, was discovered and named after Carroll. The Lewis Carroll Centenary Wood near his birthplace in Daresbury opened in 2000.[118]/nAs Carroll was born in All Saints' Vicarage, he is commemorated at All Saints' Church, Daresbury by stained glass windows depicting characters from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

He attended a Hogere Burger School, and later he took up studies in electrical engineering at the Delft Polytechnical School. After graduating in 1908, he worked for Siemens in Berlin and for a public utility in Rotterdam before returning to study mathematics in Delft in 1912. During his study he had become fascinated by the power and subtleties of vector analysis. After a short while in industry, he returned to Delft to study Mathematics, where he received his Ph.D. degree in 1914 under supervision of Jacob Cardinaal with a thesis entitled Grundlagen der Vektor- und Affinoranalysis./nSchouten was an effective university administrator and leader of mathematical societies. During his tenure as professor and as institute head he was involved in various controversies with the topologist and intuitionist mathematician L. E. J. Brouwer. He was a shrewd investor as well as mathematician and successfully managed the budget of the institute and Dutch mathematical society. He hosted the International Congress of Mathematicians in Amsterdam in early 1954, and gave the opening address. Schouten was one of the founders of the Mathematisch Centrum in Amsterdam./nAmong his PhD candidates students were Johanna Manders (1919), Dirk Struik (1922), Johannes Haantjes (1933), Wouter van der Kulk (1945), and Albert Nijenhuis (1952).[1]/nIn 1933 Schouten became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[2]/nSchouten died in 1971 in Epe. His son Jan Frederik Schouten (1910-1980) was Professor at the Eindhoven University of Technology from 1958 to 1978./nSchouten's dissertation applied his \"direct analysis\", modeled on the vector analysis of Josiah Willard Gibbs and Oliver Heaviside, to higher order tensor-like entities he called affinors. The symmetrical subset of affinors were tensors in the physicists' sense of Woldemar Voigt./nEntities such as axiators, perversors, and deviators appear in this analysis. Just as vector analysis has dot products and cross products, so affinor analysis has different kinds of products for tensors of various levels. However, instead of two kinds of multiplication symbols, Schouten had at least twenty. This made the work a chore to read, although the conclusions were valid./nSchouten later said in conversation with Hermann Weyl that he would \"like to throttle the man who wrote this book.\" (Karin Reich, in her history of tensor analysis, misattributes this quote to Weyl.) Weyl did, however, say that Schouten's early book has \"orgies of formalism that threaten the peace of even the technical scientist.\" (Space, Time, Matter, p.\u00a054). Roland Weitzenb\u00f6ck wrote of \"the terrible book he has committed.\"/nIn 1906, L. E. J. Brouwer was the first mathematician to consider the  parallel transport of a vector for the case of \na space of constant curvature.[3][4] In 1917, Levi-Civita pointed out its importance for the case of a hypersurface\nimmersed in a Euclidean space, i.e., for the case of a Riemannian manifold immersed in a \"larger\" ambient space.[5] In 1918, independently of Levi-Civita, Schouten obtained analogous results.[6] In the same year, Hermann Weyl generalized \nLevi-Civita's results.[7][8] Schouten's derivation is generalized to many dimensions rather than just two, and Schouten's proofs are completely intrinsic rather than extrinsic, unlike Tullio Levi-Civita's. Despite this, since Schouten's article appeared almost a year after Levi-Civita's, the latter got the credit. Schouten was unaware of Levi-Civita's work because of poor journal distribution and communication during World War I. Schouten engaged in a losing priority dispute with Levi-Civita. Schouten's colleague L. E. J. Brouwer took sides against Schouten. Once Schouten became aware of Ricci's and Levi-Civita's work, he embraced their simpler and more widely accepted notation. Schouten also developed what is now known as a K\u00e4hler manifold two years before Erich K\u00e4hler.[citation needed] Again he did not receive full recognition for this discovery./nSchouten's name appears in various mathematical entities and theorems, such as the Schouten tensor, the Schouten bracket and the Weyl\u2013Schouten theorem./nHe wrote Der Ricci-Kalk\u00fcl in 1922 surveying the field of tensor analysis./nIn 1931 he wrote a treatise on tensors and differential geometry. The second volume, on applications to differential geometry, was authored by his student Dirk Jan Struik./nSchouten collaborated with \u00c9lie Cartan on two articles as well as with many other eminent mathematicians such as Kentaro Yano (with whom he co-authored three papers). Through his student and co-author Dirk Struik his work influenced many mathematicians in the United States./nIn the 1950s Schouten completely rewrote and updated the German version of Ricci-Kalk\u00fcl and this was translated into English as Ricci Calculus. This covers everything that Schouten considered of value in tensor analysis. This included work on Lie groups and other topics and that had been much developed since the first edition./nLater Schouten wrote Tensor Analysis for Physicists attempting to present the subtleties of various aspects of tensor calculus for mathematically inclined physicists. It included Paul Dirac's matrix calculus. He still used part of his earlier affinor terminology./nSchouten, like Weyl and Cartan, was stimulated by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. He co-authored a paper with Alexander Aleksandrovich Friedmann of Petersburg and another with V\u00e1clav Hlavat\u00fd.

It becomes equally clear to his employers, who are college-educated, that Ramanujan's mathematical insights exceed the simple accounting tasks they are assigning to him and soon they encourage him to make his personal writings in mathematics available to the general public and to start to contact professors of mathematics at universities by writing to them. One such letter is sent to G.H.

He graduated in 1945 with an AB in physics./nIn 1946, he began a Ph.D. in mathematics at Berkeley. He initially worked under the supervision of the topologist John L. Kelley, writing on C* algebras. In 1950, in response to McCarthyite pressures, Berkeley required all staff to sign a loyalty oath. Kelley declined and moved his career to Tulane University for three years. Vaught then began afresh under the supervision of Alfred Tarski, completing in 1954 a thesis on mathematical logic, titled Topics in the Theory of Arithmetical Classes and Boolean Algebras. After spending four years at the University of Washington, Vaught returned to Berkeley in 1958, where he remained until his 1991 retirement./nIn 1957, Vaught married Marilyn Maca; they had two children./nVaught's work is primarily focused on model theory. In 1957, he and Tarski introduced elementary submodels and the Tarski\u2013Vaught test characterizing them. In 1962, he and Michael D. Morley pioneered the concept of a saturated structure. His investigations on countable models of first-order theories led him to the Vaught conjecture stating that the number of countable models of a complete first-order theory (in a countable language) is always either finite, or countably infinite, or equinumerous with the real numbers.  Vaught's \"Never 2\" theorem states that a complete first-order theory cannot have exactly two nonisomorphic countable models./nHe considered his best work was his paper \"Invariant sets in topology and logic\"[citation needed], introducing the Vaught transform.

His parents owned a house in the town, but the home-craft they made did not bring in enough money, so at the age of 12, Boris started working as a calligrapher in the court. He had finished school in Polotsk but still needed the exams from an additional year to grant him the right to continue education at a higher level. He passed those in Minsk in 1893 as an external student. The same year he was enrolled at St. Petersburg Technological Institute's mechanics department. Due to the lack of funds, Boris Grigoryevich had to combine studying at the institute with working as a draftsman and giving private lessons. At some point, he married Revekka Treivas, a second niece. They did not have children.[citation needed]/nGalerkin's first scientific work was published by the institute \"Transactions\". The article was titled \"A theory of longitudinal curving and an experience of longitudinal curving theory application to many-storied frames, frames with rigid junctions and frame systems\".  He wrote it while in the \"Kresty\" prison. In the summer of 1909, Boris Grigoryevich went abroad to see constructions and buildings which interested him. During the next four years, i.e., before World War I, he and many other institute staff visited Europe to stimulate their scientific interests. Galerkin visited Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, and Sweden./nGalerkin taught students in the mechanical department structural mechanics, i.e., conducted exercises and designing.

In 1913, he worked on the design of the metallic frame for a boiler power plant in St. Petersburg - the first building with metallic frame under big loads in Russia. Later it was considered to be one of Europe's unique engineering objects. Galerkin regularly published his works in the institutes \"Transactions\", and since 1915 - also in Engineering News. Before 1915, pivot systems were at the center of his scientific interest; later he started researching plates./nIn 1915, Galerkin published an article in which he put forward an idea of an approximate method for differential equations, in particular boundary value problems. He applied his method to a big number of pivot and plate analysis problems. Sometime before, I.G.Bubnov developed a similar approach for the variational problem solution, which he interpreted as a variant of the Ritz method algorithm. The distinguishing features of Galerkin's method were the following: he did not associate the method, developed by him, with any variational problem direct solution, but considered it to be common for solving differential equations. He interpreted it, using the probable displacements principle. These ideas proved to be very productive, not only in structural mechanics but for mathematical physics at large./nThe Galerkin method (or Bubnov-Galerkin method) with Galerkin's (or \"weak\") differential equations problem statement form are known all over the world. Today, they provide a foundation for algorithms in the fields of mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, hydrodynamics, and many others./nIn January 1919, Galerkin became a professor in the 2nd (formerly Women's) Polytechnical Institute, remaining a teacher of structural mechanics in the 1st Polytechnical Institute (at that time the Polytechnical Institute was named so) mechanical department. In March 1920, a professor chair in structural mechanics was established at the department, and Boris Grigoryevich won it in a competition. In the summer of 1921, S.P.

Galerkin took part in a competition for his chair and at the beginning of 1922, he left the mechanical faculty for the civil engineering faculty, which was nearer to him in his scientific and engineering activities./nFrom 1917 to 1919, Galerkin published a series of works on rectangular and triangular plates curving in scientific periodicals and in the \"Russian Academy of Sciences Transactions\". Later he took a break from publications, and only in 1922 he began publishing again, but only in foreign magazines (in the Soviet Union there was not enough paper for scientific literature)./nIn December 1923, Galerkin was elected dean of the Polytechnical Institutes' civil engineering faculty. It happened during a very important period of the institute's history, when a group of deans resigned from their posts, protesting from the unceremonious intervention of so-called \"student' representatives\", controlled by the trade unions and the Communist party committees, into the educational process. Galerkin proved to be a talented leader of the faculty. He managed to neutralize overly active \"assistants\", who were appointed against his will, and he did not hurry to fulfill the orders of incompetent leaders who were conducting infinite experiments at the higher school at that time. From 1924 to 1929, Galerkin was also a professor in the Railway Engineers Institute and at St. Petersburg University. In 1924 he made his last trip abroad to participate in the Congress on applied mechanics in the Netherlands./nIn the spring of 1926, Galerkin learned that Narkompros (Ministry of education) had adopted a decision to close the road-making section at his faculty. This decision was prepared and adopted secretly by the dean of the Institute Communist party committee in the connection with the company on the elimination of parallel specialties. Meanwhile, there were no other faculties in the country training specialists in the construction of electrified railways, urban railways, and subways (the faculty had worked on this since 1907). Galerkin managed to cancel this rash decision by Moscow. During the period of Galerkin at the dean's post, the first laboratory at the faculty was created. He also managed to receive governmental approval for the idea to build some other big laboratories for the faculty (the Hydrotechnical Research Institute was later established on their base)./nIn January 1928, Galerkin was appointed as a corresponding member-elected of the USSR Academy of sciences. His candidature was nominated by academicians A.F. Yoffe (Abram Ioffe), A.N. Krylov, and P.P. Lazarev. In October 1929, he left the dean's post. After this, the civil engineering faculty was divided into two parts: the hydrotechnical and irrigation sections became the water industry faculty and the rest became a part of the civil engineering faculty. was soon left out of the Polytechnical Institute and became the Civil and Industrial Engineering Institute, which however does not exist anymore. The water industry faculty soon became the Hydrotechnical institute. Galerkin was a professor at both institutes./nBy the 1920s, Galerkin was already a world-famous scientist. He had become an authority among engineers. He was often recruited as a consultant to the designing and construction of serious industrial objects in northwest Russia (heat power plants, Volkhov hydro power plant, Kondopoga pulp, paper mill, and others). He was a member of the technical councils of the designing institutes Gipromez and Giprotsvetmet, a member of the academic councils of the research institutes: Irrigation Institute (later\u2013Hydrotechnical Research Institute), and the Institute of Structures. After the end of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station construction, Boris Grigoryevich also became a member of the governmental commission./nIn 1934, Galerkin got two doctoral degrees in technics and mathematics and the Honoured Worker in Science and Engineering title. At the beginning of 1936, he was elected a member of the USSR Academy of sciences. He also became a member of the highest Certifying Commission in the State Committee on higher technical education, a chairman of the technical mechanic's group in the USSR Academy of sciences technical section, the headmaster of the USSR Academy of Sciences Institute of Mechanics, the chairman of the Civil engineers scientific society and its Leningrad section. In April 1936, according to a governmental order, Galerkin was appointed chairman of the Governmental Commission for the examination of the Moscow Palace of Soviets steel frame walls and overlappings initial project./nThough having so many titles, Galerkin remained a professor of the structural mechanics and theory of elasticity department at the hydrotechnical faculty (the Hydrotechnical Institute was returned to the Polytechnical (at that time\u2013Industrial) Institute as a faculty in 1934). Mostly he taught the course on the theory of elasticity, which was very difficult for the students of that time, who had very weak training in mathematics. Students were visiting his lectures to look at the \"real academician\", but he disappointed them. He was short, puny, and had a weak voice. His image did not correspond to the status of a serious scientist with big authority, received from the government. At one time the academician was even pulled out of a tram by other passengers, and after this \"accident\", the institute administration applied to the authorities for a car./nGalerkin drew in generals uniform in 1939 when the VITU of Navy (previously known as the Nikolaevsky Engineering Academy, now Military engineering-technical university, Russian: \u0412\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e-\u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442), was a revival on the base of Civil and Industrial Engineering Institute, as the head of its structural mechanics department and the academician became a lieutenant general. Boris Grigoryevich had never been in the army before but had to wear the general's uniform. He was shy and when someone saluted him he became frightened and waved his hands./nIn the summer of 1941, after the beginning of the war, the Commission on the defensive installations construction was created by the city government. Some academicians and prominent scientists became members (almost everyone was from the Polytechnical Institute), but only Boris Grigoryevich was involved with construction engineering. Practically, he became the supervisor of the work for the commission. Simultaneously, Boris Grigoryevich was the city engineering defense department experts group head./nLater, he was evacuated to Moscow, where he joined the military engineering commission of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. Hard non-stop work was undermining the scientist's health. Not long after the Great Victory, Galerkin died in Moscow on 12 July 1945. He is buried in the Volkovo Cemetery in St. Petersburg.[3]/nGalerkin's name is attached to the finite element method, which is a way to numerically solve partial differential equations./nGalerkin methods include:", "21605403": "William Neile (7 December 1637 \u2013 24 August 1670) was an English mathematician and founder member of the Royal Society.

By carrying out the determination of arc lengths on a curve given algebraically, in other words by extending to algebraic curves generally with Cartesian geometry a basic concept from differential geometry, it represented a major advance in what would become infinitesimal calculus. His name also appears as Neil./nNeile was born at Bishopsthorpe, the eldest son of Sir Paul Neile MP for Ripon and Newark. His grandfather was Richard Neile, the Archbishop of York.[1] He entered Wadham College, Oxford as a gentleman-commoner in 1652, matriculating in 1655. He was taught by John Wilkins and Seth Ward.[1]/nIn 1657, he became a student at the Middle Temple. In the same year he gave his exact rectification of the semicubical parabola and communicated his discovery to William Brouncker, Christopher Wren and others connected with Gresham College.  His demonstration was published by Wallis in De Cycloide (1659). The general formula for rectification by definite integral was in effect discovered by Hendrik van Heuraet in 1659. In 1673 Wallis asserted that Christiaan Huyghens, who was advancing his own claim to have influenced Heuraet, was also slighting the priority of Neile.\n[1][2]/nNeile was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 7 January 1663 and a member of the council on 11 April 1666. He entered the debate on the theory of motion, as a critic of the empiricist stance of other members. His own theory of motion was held up from publication by unfavourable peer review by Wallis, in 1667; a revision was communicated to the society on 29 April 1669. Neile objected to Wren's 1668 work on collision as lacking discussion of causality: he asked for discussion of the nature of momentum. His own work was much influenced by ideas drawn from the De Corpore of Thomas Hobbes.[1][3][4]/nHe made astronomical observations with instruments erected on the roof of his father's residence, the \u201cHill House\u201d (later called Waltham Place) at White Waltham in Berkshire, where he died at the age of 32.

He made important contributions to the theory of vorticity arising from the motion of ships and aircraft through water and air; his work on wake turbulence led the airlines to increase the minimum time between takeoffs of aircraft on the same runway.[7][17][18] Saffman also studied the flow of spheroidal particles in a fluid, such as bubbles in a carbonated beverage or corpuscles in blood; his work overturned previous assumptions that inertia was an important factor in these particles' motion and showed instead that Non-Newtonian properties of fluids play a significant role.[12][19]/nAlong with his many research papers,[14] Saffman wrote a book, Vortex Dynamics,[5][6] surveying a field to which he had been a principal contributor.

He participated in the association's third annual meeting in Parkersburg in 1893,[28][29] and at the association's fourth annual meeting in Montgomery in 1894, Hill was appointed to a committee to urge the West Virginia Legislature to make an appropriation to the West Virginia Colored Institute's teaching fund.[29][30] He attended the association's fifth meeting in Hinton in 1895 and the sixth meeting in Charleston in 1896, where he provided the welcoming remarks.[30][31]/nHill resigned his position as principal in 1898 to fight in the Spanish\u2013American War,[2][25][32] and he was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the 8th\u00a0United States Infantry Volunteer Immunes of the United States Volunteers on July\u00a019, 1898.[13][25][26][32][33] He was also appointed as the regimental commissary officer.[6] In addition to Hill, six of the institute's students enlisted, four of whom were made non-commissioned officers.[32] Hill was honorably discharged the next year on March\u00a06, 1899.[13] Following his resignation, the Board of Regents placed James M. Canty of the Mechanical Department in charge of the school until the board's election of James McHenry Jones in September 1898.[26][33] Hill returned to the institute when he was appointed as Commandant of Cadets and professor of mathematics in June 1899.[2][6][25] As commandant, Hill led the institute's cadets in West Virginia military parades.[34][35]/nIn February 1900, Hill announced his candidacy for a Kanawha County seat in the West Virginia House of Delegates.[36] Hill was the only African-American candidate for a legislative seat in West Virginia's primary elections.[37] He narrowly lost to Shelton Johnson in the Republican primary in May 1900.[37]/nHill resigned from his positions at the West Virginia Colored Institute in 1903 and spent the following year traveling across the Western United States and Mexico.[6][25] He then resided in Oklahoma before returning to West Virginia in 1913.[6][25] During World War I, Hill served as a welfare worker in the coalfields of Southern West Virginia.[6] Following the war, Hill worked as an assistant at the West Virginia Workmen's Department of Compensation in nearby Charleston, and he remained in this position until 1929.[6][25] Declining health led to Hill resigning from this position.[6]/nHill visited the institute (then known as West Virginia Collegiate Institute) in November 1922, and delivered a presentation on \"Mexico and Its People\", based upon his personal knowledge from his travels in Mexico.[38] While Hill no longer worked directly for the institute, he continued his affiliation with the school as an occasional lecturer at student assemblies and informal advisor to students.[25]/nIn 1933, Hill published Princess Malah, a historical novel about a slave on the plantation of Samuel Washington, George Washington's brother.[39][40][41] Hill wrote Princess Malah \"to depict the relationships existing between the master and slave in the period of our history just prior to the Revolutionary War\".[39][40] As a descendant of slaves in George Washington's household, Hill grew up listening to stories about the private lives of the Washington family.[6] In Hill's novel, Princess Malah is the daughter of Lawrence Washington and the rightful heiress to Mount Vernon.[39][40][41]/nIn 1935, West Virginia's State Board of Education honored Hill's service to West Virginia State College by naming him the college's president emeritus.[6] In April 1936, Hill was a founding member of the West Virginia sustaining membership committee of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History.[42][43] In May 1936, as president emeritus, Hill participated in West Virginia State's Founder's Day exercises on the 44th anniversary of the college's opening.[44]/nHill died of sepsis on October\u00a013, 1936, at his home in Institute.[3][45] His funeral services were held at West Virginia State,[46] and he was interred at Institute Cemetery.[3][46]/nWest Virginia State University's Hill Hall is named for Hill.[2][47] Hill Hall was a dormitory for upper-class women, and was built between 1936 and 1937 and renovated in 1979.[47] Hill Hall formerly housed West Virginia State's Counseling and Tutoring Center, Upward Bound, and Special Services.[47] Hill Hall currently houses the university's Business Administration, Economics, English, History, Modern Foreign Language, Political Science, and Sociology Departments.[47]/nOn the morning of New Year's Day in January 1889, Hill married Etta Lovett in Harpers Ferry.[48][49] According to The Shepherdstown Register, the \"marriage was conducted very quietly on account of the recent death\" of Lovett's father.[49] Prior to her marriage, Lovett was the organist for Storer College in Harpers Ferry.[49]", "68758573": "Jeb F.

Steele Prize for lifetime achievement and election to the National Academy of Sciences./nAfter graduate study at the University of California, Berkeley, Graham worked for many years at Bell Labs and later at the University of California, San Diego. He did important work in scheduling theory, computational geometry, Ramsey theory, and quasi-randomness,[3] and many topics in mathematics are named after him. He published six books and about 400 papers, and had nearly 200 co-authors, including many collaborative works with his wife Fan Chung and with Paul Erd\u0151s./nGraham has been featured in Ripley's Believe It or Not! for being not only \"one of the world's foremost mathematicians\", but also an accomplished trampolinist and juggler. He served as president of the International Jugglers' Association.[3][4][5]/nGraham was born in Taft, California, on October 31, 1935;[6] his father was an oil field worker and later merchant marine. Despite Graham's later interest in gymnastics, he was small and non-athletic.[7] He grew up moving frequently between California and Georgia, skipping several grades of school in these moves, and never staying at any one school longer than a year.[1][7] As a teenager, he moved to Florida with his then-divorced mother, where he went to but did not finish high school. Instead, at the age of 15 he won a Ford Foundation scholarship to the University of Chicago, where he learned gymnastics but took no mathematics courses.[1]/nAfter three years, when his scholarship expired, he moved to the University of California, Berkeley, officially as a student of electrical engineering but also studying number theory under Derrick Henry Lehmer,[1] and winning a title as California state trampoline champion.[7] He enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1955, when he reached the age of eligibility,[8] left Berkeley without a degree, and was stationed in Fairbanks, Alaska, where he finally completed a bachelor's degree in physics in 1959 at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.[1] Returning to the University of California, Berkeley for graduate study, he received his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1962. His dissertation, supervised by Lehmer, was On Finite Sums of Rational Numbers.[9] While a graduate student, he supported himself by performing on trampoline in a circus,[8] and married Nancy Young, an undergraduate mathematics student at Berkeley; they had two children.[1]/nAfter completing his doctorate, Graham went to work in 1962 at Bell Labs and later as Director of Information Sciences at AT&T Labs, both in New Jersey. In 1963, at a conference in Colorado, he met the prolific Hungarian mathematician Paul Erd\u0151s (1913\u20131996),[1] who became a close friend and frequent research collaborator. Graham was chagrined to be beaten in ping-pong by Erd\u0151s, then already middle-aged; he returned to New Jersey determined to improve his game, and eventually became Bell Labs champion and won a state title in the game.[1] Graham later popularized the concept of the Erd\u0151s number, a measure of distance from Erd\u0151s in the collaboration network of mathematicians;[10][8] his many works with Erd\u0151s include two books of open problems[B1][B5] and Erd\u0151s's final posthumous paper.[A15] Graham divorced in the 1970s; in 1983 he married his Bell Labs colleague and frequent coauthor Fan Chung.[1]/nWhile at Bell Labs, Graham also took a position at Rutgers University as University Professor of Mathematical Sciences in 1986, and served a term as president of the American Mathematical Society from 1993 to 1994. He became Chief Scientist of the labs in 1995.[1] He retired from AT&T in 1999 after 37 years of service there,[11] and moved to the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), as the Irwin and Joan Jacobs Endowed Professor of Computer and Information Science.[1][8] At UCSD, he also became chief scientist at the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology.[8][5] In 2003\u201304, he was president of the Mathematical Association of America.[1]/nGraham died of bronchiectasis[12] on July 6, 2020, aged 84, in La Jolla, California.[6][13]/nGraham made important contributions in multiple areas of mathematics and theoretical computer science. He published about 400 papers, a quarter of those with Chung,[14] and six books, including Concrete Mathematics with Donald Knuth and Oren Patashnik.[B4] The Erd\u0151s Number Project lists him as having nearly 200 coauthors.[15] He was the doctoral advisor of nine students, one each at the City University of New York and Rutgers University while he was at Bell Labs, and seven at UC San Diego.[9]/nNotable topics in mathematics named after Graham include the Erd\u0151s\u2013Graham problem on Egyptian fractions, the Graham\u2013Rothschild theorem in the Ramsey theory of parameter words and Graham's number derived from it, the Graham\u2013Pollak theorem and Graham's pebbling conjecture in graph theory, the Coffman\u2013Graham algorithm for approximate scheduling and graph drawing, and the Graham scan algorithm for convex hulls. He also began the study of primefree sequences, the Boolean Pythagorean triples problem, the biggest little polygon, and square packing in a square./nGraham was one of the contributors to the publications of G. W. Peck, a pseudonymous mathematical collaboration named for the initials of its members, with Graham as the \"G\".[16]/nGraham's doctoral dissertation was in number theory, on Egyptian fractions,[7][9] as is the Erd\u0151s\u2013Graham problem on whether, for every partition of the integers into finitely many classes, one of these classes has a finite subclass whose reciprocals sum to one. A proof was published by Ernie Croot in 2003.[17] Another of Graham's papers on Egyptian fractions was published in 2015 with Steve Butler and (nearly 20 years posthumously) Erd\u0151s; it was the last of Erd\u0151s's papers to be published, making Butler his 512th coauthor.[A15][18]/nIn a 1964 paper, Graham began the study of primefree sequences by observing that there exist sequences of numbers, defined by the same recurrence relation as the Fibonacci numbers, in which none of the sequence elements is prime.[A64] The challenge of constructing more such sequences was later taken up by Donald Knuth and others.[19] Graham's 1980 book with Erd\u0151s, Old and new results in combinatorial number theory, provides a collection of open problems from a broad range of subareas within number theory.[B1]/nThe Graham\u2013Rothschild theorem in Ramsey theory was published by Graham and Bruce Rothschild in 1971, and applies Ramsey theory to combinatorial cubes in combinatorics on words.[A71a] Graham gave a large number as an upper bound for an instance of this theorem, now known as Graham's number, which was listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest number ever used in a mathematical proof,[20] although it has since then been surpassed by even larger numbers such as TREE(3).[21]/nGraham offered a monetary prize for solving the Boolean Pythagorean triples problem, another problem in Ramsey theory; the prize was claimed in 2016.[22]\nGraham also published two books on Ramsey theory.[B2][B3]/nThe Graham\u2013Pollak theorem, which Graham published with Henry O. Pollak in two papers in 1971 and 1972,[A71b][A72a] states that if the edges of an \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n-vertex complete graph are partitioned into complete bipartite subgraphs, then at least \n\n\n\nn\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n-1}\n\n subgraphs are needed. Graham and Pollak provided a simple proof using linear algebra; despite the combinatorial nature of the statement and multiple publications of alternative proofs since their work, all known proofs require linear algebra.[23]/nSoon after research in quasi-random graphs began with the work of Andrew Thomason, Graham published in 1989 a result with Chung and R. M. Wilson that has been called the \"fundamental theorem of quasi-random graphs\", stating that many different definitions of these graphs are equivalent.[A89a][24]/nGraham's pebbling conjecture, appearing in a 1989 paper by Chung,[25] concerns the pebbling number of Cartesian products of graphs. As of 2019[update], it remains unsolved.[26]/nGraham's early work on job shop scheduling[A66][A69] introduced the worst-case approximation ratio into the study of approximation algorithms, and laid the foundations for the later development of competitive analysis of online algorithms.[27] This work was later recognized to be important also for the theory of bin packing,[28] an area that Graham later worked in more explicitly.[A74]/nThe Coffman\u2013Graham algorithm, which Graham published with Edward G. Coffman Jr. in 1972,[A72b] provides an optimal algorithm for two-machine scheduling, and a guaranteed approximation algorithm for larger numbers of machines. It has also been applied in layered graph drawing.[29]/nIn a survey article on scheduling algorithms published in 1979, Graham and his coauthors introduced a three-symbol notation for classifying theoretical scheduling problems according to the system of machines they are to run on, the characteristics of the tasks and resources such as requirements for synchronization or non-interruption, and the performance measure to be optimized.[A79] This classification has sometimes been called \"Graham notation\" or \"Graham's notation\".[30]/nGraham scan is a widely used and practical algorithm for convex hulls of two-dimensional point sets, based on sorting the points and then inserting them into the hull in sorted order.[31] Graham published the algorithm in 1972.[A72c]/nThe biggest little polygon problem asks for the polygon of largest area for a given diameter. Surprisingly, as Graham observed, the answer is not always a regular polygon.[A75a] Graham's 1975 conjecture on the shape of these polygons was finally proven in 2007.[32]/nIn another 1975 publication, Graham and Erd\u0151s observed that for packing unit squares into a larger square with non-integer side lengths, one can use tilted squares to leave an uncovered area that is sublinear in the side length of the larger square, unlike the obvious packing with axis-aligned squares.[A75b] Klaus Roth and Bob Vaughan proved that uncovered area at least proportional to the square root of the side length may sometimes be needed; proving a tight bound on the uncovered area remains an open problem.[33]/nIn nonparametric statistics, a 1977 paper by Persi Diaconis and Graham studied the statistical properties of Spearman's footrule, a measure of rank correlation that compares two permutations by summing, over each item, the distance between the positions of the item in the two permutations.[A77]\nThey compared this measure to other rank correlation methods, resulting in the \"Diaconis\u2013Graham inequalities\"/nwhere \n\n\n\nD\n\n\n{\\displaystyle D}\n\n is Spearman's footrule, \n\n\n\nI\n\n\n{\\displaystyle I}\n\n is the number of inversions between the two permutations (a non-normalized version of the Kendall rank correlation coefficient), and \n\n\n\nE\n\n\n{\\displaystyle E}\n\n is the minimum number of two-element swaps needed to obtain one permutation from the other.[34]/nThe Chung\u2013Diaconis\u2013Graham random process is a random walk on the integers modulo an odd integer \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n, in which at each step one doubles the previous number and then randomly adds zero, \n\n\n\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1}\n\n, or \n\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle -1}\n\n (modulo \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n). In a 1987 paper, Chung, Diaconis, and Graham studied the mixing time of this process, motivated by the study of pseudorandom number generators.[A87][35]/nGraham became a capable juggler beginning at age 15, and was practiced in juggling up to six balls.[4] (Although a published photo shows him juggling twelve balls,[5] it is a manipulated image.[3]) He taught Steve Mills, a repeat winner of the International Jugglers' Association championships, how to juggle, and his work with Mills helped inspire Mills to develop the Mills' Mess juggling pattern. As well, Graham made significant contributions to the theory of juggling, including a sequence of publications on siteswaps. In 1972 he was elected president of the International Jugglers' Association.[4]/nIn 2003, Graham won the American Mathematical Society's annual Leroy P. Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement. The prize cited his contributions to discrete mathematics, his popularization of mathematics through his talks and writing, his leadership at Bell Labs, and his service as president of the society.[2] He was one of five inaugural winners of the George P\u00f3lya Prize of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, sharing it with fellow Ramsey theorists Klaus Leeb, Bruce Rothschild, Alfred Hales, and Robert I. Jewett.[36] He was also one of two inaugural winners of the Euler Medal of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications, the other being Claude Berge.[37]/nGraham was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1985.[38] In 1999 he was inducted as an ACM Fellow \"for seminal contributions to the analysis of algorithms, in particular the worst-case analysis of heuristics, the theory of scheduling, and computational geometry\".[39] He became a Fellow of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics in 2009; the fellow award cited his \"contributions to discrete mathematics and its applications\".[40] In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[41]/nGraham was an invited speaker at the 1982 International Congress of Mathematicians (held 1983 in Warsaw),[13] speaking on \"Recent developments in Ramsey theory\".[A84] He was twice Josiah Willard Gibbs Lecturer, in 2001 and 2015.[13]\nThe Mathematical Association of America awarded him both the Carl Allendoerfer Prize for his paper \"Steiner Trees on a Checkerboard\" with Chung and Martin Gardner in Mathematics Magazine (1989),[A89b][42] and the Lester R.

Effendi, Bey and Pasha corresponded to the different ranks he attained along his career; \"al-Falaki\" was added to his name literally meaning \"the astronomer\".[1][2][3][4] He was born in Cairo to a family of Turkish origin and was educated in Paris, France.[5]/nEgyptian astronomy has ancient roots which were revived in the 19th century by the modernist impetus of Muhammad Ali who founded in Sabtieh, Boulaq district, in Cairo an Observatory which he was keen to keep in harmony with the progress of this science still in progress. The staff at this establishment were recruited from among the best students of the Boulaq \u00c9cole polytechnique (Polytechnic), headed by Charles Joseph Lambert, a French engineer. Thus, Ismail Mustafa entered the Observatory after his technical studies.[6][4][7]/nCharles Joseph Lambert, wanting to give greater impetus to the intellectual movement which was germinating in the country and to respond to the aspirations of Viceroy Abbas I, easily obtained the sovereign's acquiescence to the sending to Europe, in 1850, of three young engineers chosen from among the best graduates of the Bulaq \u00c9cole polytechnique. Mahmoud Hamdi (Mahmoud Pasha al-Falaki), Ismail Mustafa and Hussein Ibrahim were appointed to complete their studies in France.[4]/nMahmoud and Ismail devoted themselves to the in-depth study of astronomy, and through their erudition public favor forever bestowed upon them the title of al-Falaki (the astronomer).[4]/nAfter completing his practical and theoretical studies Ismail Mustafa had the special mission of taking care of the construction of astronomical instruments, in order to be able to ensure, in the future, the perfect functioning and possible repair of the Egyptian Observatory's devices. To this end, he devoted himself for an entire year to the study of the construction and repair of precision instruments in Brunner's workshops in Paris.[4]/nIn 1858, a Technical Commission was set up to continue, by adopting the procedures instituted in Europe, the cadastre work, inaugurated by means of the Kassaba, under Muhammad Ali. This Commission suggested to Viceroy Mohammed Sa'id Pasha the idea of building geodetic devices which were ordered in France.[4]/nWhile Mahmoud al-Falaki was in charge, in Egypt, of the direction of the work of the general map, the viceroy entrusted to Ismail the study, in Europe, of the precision apparatus calibrated against the metre intended to measure the geodesic bases and already built by Jean Brunner in Paris. Ismail Mustafa had the task to carry out the experiments necessary for determining the expansion coefficients of the two platinum and brass rules, and to compare Egyptian standard with a known standard. The Spanish standard designed by Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero and Frutos Saavedra Meneses was chosen for this purpose, as it had served as a model for the construction of the Egyptian standard. In addition, the Spanish standard had been compared with Borda's double-toise N\u00b0 1, which served as a comparison module for the measurement of all geodesic bases in France.[8][4][6]/nOn the return of Ismail Mustafa to Egypt, after 14 years of stay in Europe, the Khedive Isma'il Pasha taking into consideration the wise advice suggested by Urbain Le Verrier to his predecessor to put Boulaq Observatory on the same level as similar establishments in Europe, instructed him to set up a new observatory, which was established in 1868 at Abbassia, and  would later be transferred to Helwan, in 1903. Ismail Mustafa al-Falaki took charge of the Abbassia Observatory which became the Khedival Observatory.[4][9][10]/nIn 1873 Ismail Mustafa was delegated to the International Statistical Congress in Moscow, where the Tsar conferred on him the rank of Commander in the Imperial Order of Saint Anna.[4]/nIn 1883 he was appointed director of the \u00c9cole polytechnique. He was also appointed director of the School of Land Surveying, he founded. He taught cosmography, geodesy and astronomy at the Military Academy and in the two schools he directed.[4]/nHe was the author of books in Arabic including an elementary treatise on astronomy and the first volume of a long-term work on the same subject and geodesy. He retired in 1886. Until his death he published Arabic almanacs and European calendars on behalf of the Egyptian state.[4]/nIn 1899, he was conferred the insignia of Grand Officer in the Imperial Order of the Medjidie.[4]/nEgypt was, after the United States of America and Spain in Europe, the first country in Africa to use a geodetic standard calibrated against the metre. The history of the metre reveals that it was then chosen as an international scientific unit of length by the European Arc Measurement which would later become the International Association of Geodesy. The inspiration for the creation of this association came to Johann Jacob Baeyer following the measurement of the geodetic arc of Struve.[11][6][12]/nIn 1954, the connection of the southerly extension of the Struve Arc with an arc running north from South Africa through Egypt brought the course of a major meridian arc back to land where Eratosthenes had founded geodesy.[12]", "56765498": "Hans Wilhelm Alt (born 1945, Hilden) is a German mathematician, specializing in partial differential equations and their applications./nAlt received his Abitur in 1965 from the prestigious secondary school Helmholtz-Gymnasium Hilden.

His contributions to the field of mathematics led to the birth of graph theory./nPetersen's interests in mathematics were manifold, including: geometry, complex analysis, number theory, mathematical physics, mathematical economics, cryptography and graph theory.\nHis famous paper Die Theorie der regul\u00e4ren graphs[1] was a fundamental contribution to modern graph theory as we know it today. In 1898, he presented a counterexample to Tait's claimed theorem about 1-factorability of 3-regular graphs, which is nowadays known as the \"Petersen graph\". In cryptography and mathematical economics he made contributions which today are seen as pioneering./nHe published a systematic treatment of geometrical constructions (with straightedge and compass) in 1880. A French translation was reprinted in 1990./nA special issue of Discrete Mathematics has been dedicated to the 150th birthday of Petersen.[2]/nPetersen, as he claimed, had a very independent way of thinking. In order to preserve this independence he made a habit to read as little as possible of other people's mathematics, pushing it to extremes. The consequences for his lack of knowledge of the literature of the time were severe. He spent a significant part of his time rediscovering already known results, in other cases already existing results had to be removed from a submitted paper and in other more serious cases a paper did not get published at all./nHe started from very modest beginnings, and by hard work, some luck and some good connections, moved steadily upward to a station of considerable importance. In 1891 his work received royal recognition through the award of the Order of the Dannebrog. Among mathematicians he enjoyed an international reputation. At his death \u2013which was front-page news in Copenhagen\u2013 the socialist newspaper Social-Demokraten correctly sensed the popular appeal of his story: here was a kind of Hans Christian Andersen of science, a child of the people who had made good in the intellectual world./nPeter Christian Julius Petersen was born on the 16th of June 1839 in Sor\u00f8 on Zealand. His parents were Jens Petersen (1803\u20131873), a dyer by profession, and Anna Cathrine Petersen (1813\u20131896), born Wiuff. He had two younger brothers, Hans Christian Rudolf Petersen (1844\u20131868) and Carl Sophus Valdemar Petersen (1846\u20131935), and two sisters, Nielsine Cathrine Marie Petersen (1837\u2013?) and Sophie Caroline Petersen (1842\u2013?). After preparation in a private school, he was admitted in 1849 into second grade at the Sor\u00f8 Academy, a prestigious boarding school. He was taken out of school after his confirmation in 1854, because his parents could not afford to keep him there, and he worked as an apprentice for almost a year in an uncle's grocery in Kolding, Jutland. The uncle died, however, and left Petersen a sum of money that enabled him to return to Sor\u00f8, pass the real-examination in 1856 with distinction, and begin his studies at the Polytechnical College in Copenhagen. In 1860 Petersen passed the first part of the civil engineering examination. By that same year he had decided to study mathematics at the university, rather than to continue with the more practical second part of the engineering education. However, his inheritance was used up and he now had to teach to make a living. From 1859 to 1871 he taught at one of Copenhagen's most prestigious private high-schools, the von Westenske Institut, with occasional part-time teaching jobs at other private schools. In 1862 he passed the student-examination, and could now enter the university. In 1866 Julius Petersen obtained the degree of magister in mathematics at the University, and by 1871 he obtained the Dr. Phil. Degree at Copenhagen University. In his doctorvita written for the university, Petersen wrote: \"Mathematics had, from the time I started to learn it, taken my complete interest, and most of my work consisted in solving problems of my own and my friends, and in seeking the trisection of the angle, a problem that has had a great influence on my whole development\"./nIn the summer of 1871 he married Laura Kirstine Bertelsen (1837\u20131901) and seven months later the couple had their first son Aage Wiuff-Petersen (1863\u20131927). Later the family increased with another son, Thor Ejnar Petersen (1867\u20131946), and a daughter, Agnete Helga Kathrine Petersen (1872\u20131941)./nMany of Petersen's early contributions to mathematics were mainly focused on geometry. During the 1860s he wrote five textbooks along with some papers, all on geometry. One of his most remarkable works was a book, \u2018Methods and Theories\u2019. The first edition of this book appeared only in Danish, but the 1879 edition was translated into eight different languages including English, French, and Spanish, earning him an international reputation more than any of his other works./nIn graph theory, two of Petersen's most famous contributions are: the Petersen graph, exhibited in 1898, served as a counterexample to Tait's \u2018theorem\u2019 on the 4-colour problem: a bridgeless 3-regular graph is factorable into three 1-factors and the theorem: \u2018a connected 3-regular graph with at most two leaves contains a 1-factor\u2019./nIn 1891 Petersen published a paper in the Acta Mathematica (volume 15, pages 193\u2013220) entitled \u2018Die Theorie der regularen graphs\u2019. It was the first paper containing (correct) results explicitly in graph theory. The paper consisted of four major parts:/nBetween 1887 and 1895 Petersen also contributed to mathematics with different models and instruments. one of these models was a \u2018eine Serie von kinematischen Modellen\u2019 which in 1888 was asked by \u2018Verlagsbuchhandler L. Brill\u2019 for permission to produce and sell. In 1887 Petersen had constructed another model; a planimeter which was presented to the Royal Danish Academy of Science and Letters. It consisted of an arm, of, whose one end o is fixed to the paper by a lead cylinder with a pin p, and whose other end f is connected to a second arm dc (or df) of length L. When the stylus d is moved around the domain once, the area is measured as L\u222bdh, where dh is the differential displacement of the arm dc orthogonal to itself.[3]/nIn the spring of 1908 Petersen suffered a stroke. Even in this condition his optimism and desire to work did not stop. In a letter to Mittag-Leffler in Stockholm he wrote: \n\u201cI feel in all respects rather well, it is only that I cannot walk and have difficulties in talking. However I hope to get so far this summer that I can resume my lectures in the autumn\u201d.  \nHis last two years became a period of physical and mental debility, where, towards the end, he hardly had any memory left of his wide interests and the rich work which had filled his life. In 1909 he retired from his professorship. He died on August 5, 1910, after having been hospitalized for five months. He was buried at Vestre Kirkegaard, where Copenhagen University cared for his grave until 1947.", "11873344": "Jack Carl Kiefer (January 25, 1924 \u2013 August 10, 1981) was an American mathematical statistician at Cornell University (1952 to 1979) and the University of California, Berkeley (1979 to 1981).

After the Council of Blachernae in 1285, his father was condemned and exiled, and Metochites seems to have spent his adolescence in the monastic milieux of Bithynia in Asia Minor. He devoted himself to studies of both secular and religious authors. When Andronicus II visited Nicaea in 1290/91, Metochites made such an impression on him that he was immediately called to the court and made Logothete of the Herds. Little more than a year later, he was appointed a Senator. Besides carrying out his political duties (embassies to Cilicia in 1295 and to Serbia in 1299), Metochites continued to study and to write.

He served as a high ranking advisor to several Byzantine emperors and was instrumental in the re-positioning of power of those emperors./nThe main sources of information about Psellos' life are his works, which contain extensive autobiographical passages. Michael Psellos was probably born in Constantinople. His family hailed from Nicomedia and, according to his own testimony, counted members of the consular and patrician elite among its ancestors. His baptismal name was Constantine; Michael was the monastic name he chose when he entered a monastery later in life. \"Psellos\" ('the stammerer') probably was a personal by-name referring to a speech defect./nMichael Psellos was educated in Constantinople. At around the age of ten, he was sent to work outside the capital as a secretary of a provincial judge, to help his family raise the dowry for his sister. When his sister died, he gave up that position and returned to Constantinople to resume his studies. While studying under John Mauropus, he met the later Patriarchs Constantine Leichoudes and John Xiphilinos, and the later emperor Constantine X Doukas. For some time, he worked in the provinces again, now a judge.[2] Some time before 1042 he returned again to Constantinople, where he got a junior position at court as a secretary (\u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2) in the imperial chancellery and began a rapid ascent at court. He became an influential political advisor to emperor Constantine IX Monomachos (reigned 1042\u20131055) and became the leading professor at the University of Constantinople, bearing the honorary title of \"Chief of the Philosophers\" (\u1f55\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c3\u03cc\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd hypatos t\u014dn philosoph\u014dn). Despite his eminence and prowess in learning, his knowledge of Latin was cloudy enough for him to confuse Cicero with Caesar. This is cited as a prime example of how the Eastern Roman Empire had lost nearly all of its connections to its Roman roots by the High Middle Ages.[3][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]/nTowards the end of Monomachos' reign, Psellos found himself under political pressure for some reason and decided to leave court, entering the Olympus monastery on Mount Olympus in Bithynia in 1054. After Monomachos' death he was recalled to court by his successor, Empress Theodora (reigned 1055\u20131056). Throughout the following years, he remained active in politics, serving as a high-ranking political advisor to successive emperors. He played a decisive political role in the transition of power from Michael VI to Isaac I Komnenos in 1057; then from Isaac Komnenos to Constantine X Doukas (1059), then again from Romanos IV Diogenes to Michael VII Doukas (1071). As Psellos had served as Michael's teacher during the reign of Michael's father Constantine, and as he had played an important role in helping Michael gain power against his adversary and stepfather Romanos, Psellos probably entertained hopes of an even more influential position as a teacher and advisor under him. Michael seems to have been less inclined towards protecting Psellos and after the mid-1070s there is no more information about any role played by Psellos at court. As his autobiographic accounts cease at this point, there is little reliable information about his later years. Some scholars believe that Psellos  had to retreat into a monastery again at some time during the 1070s.[4] Following a remark by Psellos' fellow historian Joannes Zonaras, it is believed by most scholars that Psellos died soon after the fall of Michael VII in 1078, although some scholars have also proposed later dates.[5][6] What is known is that Theophylaktos of Bulgaria wrote a letter to Psellos's brother comforting him on the death of his brother saying that, \"Your brother has not died, but has departed to God released of both a painful life and disease\".[7]/nThe Chronographia, a history of the Byzantine emperors during the 100 years leading up to Psellos' own time, is probably Psellos' best known and most accessible work. It covers the reigns of 14 emperors and empresses, beginning with the almost 50-year-long reign of Basil II, the \"Bulgar-Slayer\" (976\u20131025), and ending some time during the reign of Michael VII Doukas (1071\u20131078). It is structured mainly as a series of biographies. Unlike most other historiographical works of the period, it emphasizes the description of characters rather than details of political and military events. It also includes extensive autobiographical elements about Psellos' political and intellectual development, and it gives far greater weight to those periods when Psellos was active in politics, especially the reign of Constantine IX, giving the whole work almost the character of a political memoir. It is believed to have been written in two parts. The first covers the emperors up to Isaac I Komnenos. The second, which has a much more strongly apologetic tone, is in large parts an encomium on Psellus' protectors, the emperors of the Doukas dynasty./nPsellos left many other writings:/nPsellos was universally educated and had a reputation for being one of the most learned men of his time. He prided himself on having single-handedly reintroduced to Byzantine scholarship a serious study of ancient philosophy, especially of Plato. His predilection for Plato and other pagan (often Neoplatonic) philosophers led to doubts about the orthodoxy of his faith among some of his contemporaries, and at one point he was forced to make a public profession of faith in his defense.  He also prided himself on being a master of rhetoric, combining the wisdom of the philosopher and the persuasiveness of the rhetorician. This made him the model of a political leader and advisor. Among modern commentators, Psellos' penchant for long autobiographical digressions in his works has earned him accusations of vanity and ambition. At the same time, his political career and the contents of his Chronographia have led commentators to characterize him as obsequious and opportunistic, because of his ostensibly uncritical stance towards some of the emperors and because of the many shifts in his political loyalty over the course of his life[citation needed]. However, other commentators argue that there is a powerful ironic undercurrent running through his work, especially the Chronographia, transmitting highly critical and subversive messages about the emperors portrayed,[10] or even about Byzantine Christian beliefs and morality at large.[11]/nAs mentioned above, serious questions were raised during Psellos' lifetime concerning his religious beliefs. For example, according to Byzantinist Anthony Kaldellis, \"In 1054 he [Psellos] was accused by his erstwhile friend, the future Patriarch John Xiphilinos, of forsaking Christ to follow Plato.\"[11] Even stronger doubts arose concerning Psellos' student, John Italos, who succeeded Psellos as Chief of the Philosophers. Italos was publicly accused of teaching such \"Hellenizing\" ideas as metempsychosis and the eternity of the world. Italos faced such accusations twice, and both times he confessed and recanted.[12]/nIt was once thought that there was another Byzantine writer of the same name, Michael Psellos the Elder (now also called Pseudo-Psellos), who lived on the island of Andros in the 9th century, and who was a pupil of Photius and teacher of emperor Leo VI the Wise. Michael Psellos was also called \"the younger\" by some authors. This belief was based on an entry in a medieval chronicle, the \u03a3\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2 \u039a\u03b5\u03b4\u03c1\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6-\u03a3\u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03c3\u03b7, which mentions the name in that context. It is now believed that the inclusion of the name Psellos in this chronicle was the mistake of an ignorant copyist at a later time, and that no \"Michael Psellos the elder\" existed.[13] The term \"Pseudo-Psellos\" is also used in modern scholarship to describe the authorship of several later works that are believed to have been falsely ascribed to Psellos in Byzantine times./nIn the gloss of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", there is a reference to \"the Platonic Constantinopolitan, Michael Psellus\" as an authority on \"the invisible inhabitants of this planet, neither departed souls nor angels\"./nThe British poet Christopher Middleton includes a poem about Psellus in his 1986 collection, Two Horse Wagon Going By, \"Mezzomephistophelean Scholion\"./nPsellos appears also in Tim Severin's novel Viking: King's Man, the final piece of the Viking trilogy.", "39300192": "Gary Michael Seitz (1943 \u2013 October 30, 2023) was an American mathematician, a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society[1] and a College of Arts and Sciences Distinguished Professor Emeritus in Mathematics at the University of Oregon.

Seitz was active in the effort to exploit the relationship between algebraic groups and the finite groups of Lie type, in order to study the structure and representations of groups in the latter class.

Between frequent bouts of ill-health, he was a popular actor and maintained a vigorous fitness routine, gaining a reputation for mountaineering and winning the multi-university mile race.[3]/nIn 1921, shortly after finishing his M.Sc., he wrote a two-part essay on tensor field geometry as applied to Einstein's recent theory of General relativity (1915) which won the Smith's Prize, and led almost immediately to a fellowship at Jesus College where he remained as a lifelong bachelor for the next 61 years.[3] He dedicated himself primarily to teaching, becoming \"a teacher and lecturer of great skill and clarity whose range ... was beyond the reach of most of his younger colleagues in the faculty.\"[4] He also had multiple long-term administrative positions,[3] and had relatively few publications during this phase of his career;[5] it wasn't until retiring from his most demanding teaching and administration assignments that he published his three major books.[4] He retired as president of Jesus College in 1964, but remained \"a familiar sight in Cambridge, taking his regular afternoon constitutional... a great Cambridge character, a survivor of an era which is passing from living memory\" until his death in 1985.[6]", "48704630": "Charles Newton Little (1858\u20131923) was an American mathematician and civil engineer.

In 1893 he joined Stanford University as a professor of pure mathematics, after turning down a chair of mathematics at Nebraska.[1]\nIn 1899\u20131900 he went on leave from Stanford, and traveled to Germany to study mathematics with Felix Klein and David Hilbert.[2][5]\nHe moved again in 1901 to the University of Idaho, as a professor of civil engineering, and in 1911 was appointed as dean of engineering there.[2][5]/nHe died on September 7, 1923, of heart failure, in Berkeley, California.[2]", "142456": "Good Will Hunting is a 1997 American psychological drama film directed by Gus Van Sant, and written by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. It stars Robin Williams, Damon, Affleck, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd and Minnie Driver. The film tells the story of janitor Will Hunting, whose mathematical genius is discovered by a professor at MIT./nThe film received positive reviews from critics and grossed over $225\u00a0million during its theatrical run against a $10\u00a0million budget. At the 70th Academy Awards, it received nominations in nine categories, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won in two: Best Supporting Actor for Williams and Best Original Screenplay for Affleck and Damon. In 2014, it was ranked at number 53 in The Hollywood Reporter's \"100 Favorite Films\" list.[4]/nTwenty-year-old Will Hunting of South Boston is a natural, self-taught genius who was recently paroled from jail. He works as a janitor at MIT and spends his free time drinking with his friends Chuckie, Billy and Morgan./nWhen Professor Gerald Lambeau posts a difficult combinatorial mathematics problem on a blackboard as a challenge for his graduate students, Will solves the problem anonymously, stunning both the students and Lambeau. As a challenge to the unknown genius, Lambeau posts an even more difficult problem; he later catches Will writing the solution on the blackboard late at night, but initially thinks Will is vandalizing it and chases him off. At a bar, Will meets Skylar, a British woman about to graduate from Harvard College, who plans on attending medical school at Stanford./nMeanwhile, Lambeau, realising Will was not vandalising the problem but solving it, asks the campus maintenance staff his whereabouts, but is informed he did not turn up for work. Lambeau learns Will was placed at MIT by a parole program, and obtains his parole officer's details./nThe next day, Will and his friends get in a fight with a gang that includes a member who used to bully Will as a child. Will is arrested after he attacks a responding police officer. Lambeau sits in on his court appearance and watches Will defend himself. He arranges for Will to avoid jail time if he agrees to study mathematics under Lambeau's supervision and participate in psychotherapy sessions. Will agrees but treats his therapists with mockery./nIn desperation, Lambeau calls on Dr. Sean Maguire, his college roommate, who now teaches psychology at Bunker Hill Community College. Unlike other therapists, Sean actually challenges Will's defense mechanisms. During the first session, Will insults his deceased wife, and Sean threatens him, but after a few unproductive sessions, he finally begins to open up./nWill is particularly struck by Sean's story of how he met his wife, who later died of cancer, by giving up his ticket to the historic game six of the 1975 World Series after falling in love at first sight. Sean's explanation for surrendering his ticket was to \"see about a girl\", and he does not regret his decision. This encourages Will to build a relationship with Skylar, though he lies to her about his past and is reluctant to introduce her to his friends or show her his home. Will also challenges Sean to take an objective look at his own life, since Sean cannot move on from his wife's death./nLambeau sets up a number of job interviews for Will, but he scorns them by sending Chuckie as his \"chief negotiator\", and by turning down a position at the NSA with a scathing critique of the agency's moral position. Skylar asks Will to move to California with her, but he refuses and tells her he is an orphan, and that his foster father physically abused him./nWill breaks up with Skylar and later storms out on Lambeau, dismissing the mathematical research he has been doing. Sean points out that he is so adept at anticipating future failure in his interpersonal relationships that he deliberately sabotages them to avoid emotional pain. Chuckie likewise challenges Will over his resistance to taking any of the positions he interviews for, telling him he owes it to his friends to make the most of the opportunities they will never have, even if it means leaving one day. He then tells Will that the best part of his day is a brief moment when he waits on his doorstep, thinking Will has moved on to something greater./nWill walks in on a heated argument between Sean and Lambeau over Will's potential. Sean and Will talk and it comes to light that they were both victims of child abuse. Sean helps him see that he is a victim of his own inner demons and to accept that it is not his fault, causing him to break down in tears in Sean's arms. Will accepts one of the job offers arranged by Lambeau. Having helped Will manage his problems, Sean reconciles with Lambeau, deciding to take a sabbatical./nWill's friends give him a used car for his 21st birthday so he can commute to work. Later, Chuckie goes to Will's to pick him up, only to find that he is not there, much to his happiness. Will leaves a note for Sean asking him to tell Lambeau that he had to go \"see about a girl\", revealing he passed on the job offer and instead is heading to California to reunite with Skylar./nMatt Damon started writing the film as a final assignment for a playwriting class he was taking at Harvard University.[5] Instead of writing a one-act play, Damon submitted a 40-page script.[5] He wrote his then-girlfriend, medical student Skylar Satenstein (credited in the closing credits of the film), into his script.[6] Damon said the only scene from that script that survived \u2013 \"it survived verbatim\" \u2013 was when Will Hunting (Damon) meets his therapist, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), for the first time.[5] Damon asked Ben Affleck to develop the screenplay together. They completed the script in 1994.[5] At first, it was written as a thriller about a young man in the rough-and-tumble streets of South Boston who possesses a superior intelligence and is targeted by the government with heavy-handed recruitment.[5]/nCastle Rock Entertainment bought the script for $675,000 against $775,000, meaning that Damon and Affleck would stand to earn an additional $100,000 if the film was produced and they retained sole writing credit.[citation needed] Castle Rock president Rob Reiner urged them to drop the thriller aspect of the story and to focus on the relationship between Will and his therapist. Terrence Malick told Affleck and Damon over dinner that the film ought to end with Will's decision to follow his girlfriend Skylar to California, not them leaving together.[7]/nAt Reiner's request, screenwriter William Goldman read the script. Goldman consistently denied the persistent rumor that he wrote Good Will Hunting or acted as a script doctor. In his book Which Lie Did I Tell? Goldman jokingly writes, \"I did not just doctor it. I wrote the whole thing from scratch,\" before dismissing the rumor as false and saying his only advice was agreeing with Reiner's suggestion.[8]/nAffleck and Damon proposed to act in the lead roles, but many studio executives said they wanted Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio.[9] Meanwhile, Kevin Smith was working with Affleck on Mallrats and with both Damon and Affleck on Chasing Amy.[10] Castle Rock put the script in turnaround, and gave Damon and Affleck 30 days to find another buyer for the script who would reimburse Castle Rock the money paid, otherwise the script reverted to the studio, and Damon and Affleck would be out. All the studios that were involved in the original bidding war for the screenplay now turned the pair down, taking meetings with Affleck and Damon only to tell them this to their face. As a last resort, Affleck passed the script to his Chasing Amy director Kevin Smith, who read it and promised to walk the script directly into Harvey Weinstein's office at Miramax. Weinstein read the script, loved it, and paid Castle Rock their due, while also agreeing to let Damon and Affleck star in the film. Weinstein asked that a few scenes be removed, including an out-of-place, mid-script oral sex scene that Damon and Affleck added to trick executives who were not looking closely.[5]/nAfter buying the rights from Castle Rock, Miramax put the film into production. Several well-known filmmakers were originally considered to direct, including Mel Gibson and Michael Mann.[11] Originally, Affleck asked Kevin Smith whether he was interested in directing. He declined, saying they needed a \"good director,\"[12] that he only directed projects he wrote, and that he was not much of a visual director, but he still served as one of the film's co-executive producers. Damon and Affleck later chose Gus Van Sant for the job, whose work on previous films like Drugstore Cowboy (1989) had left a favorable impression on the fledgling screenwriters. Miramax was persuaded and hired Van Sant to direct the film.[13][14][15]/nFilming took place between April and June 1997. Although the story is set in Boston, and many of the scenes were shot on location in the Greater Boston area, many of the interior shots were filmed at locations in Toronto, with the University of Toronto standing in for MIT and Harvard University. The classroom scenes were filmed at McLennan Physical Laboratories (of the University of Toronto) and Central Technical School. Harvard normally disallows filming on its property, but permitted limited filming by the project after intervention by Harvard alumnus John Lithgow.[16] Likewise, only the exterior shots of Bunker Hill Community College were filmed in Boston; however, Sean's office was built in Toronto as an exact replica of one at the college.[17]/nThe interior bar scenes set in \"Southie\" were shot on location at Woody's L Street Tavern.[18] Meanwhile, the homes of Will (190 West 6th Street) and Sean (259 E Street), while some distance apart in the movie, actually back up to each other on Bowen Street, the narrow street Chuckie drives down to walk up to Will's back door.[19][20]/nThe Bow and Arrow Pub, which was located at the corner of Bow Street and Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge, doubled as the exterior of the Harvard bar in which Will met Skylar for the first time.[21] The Baskin-Robbins/Dunkin' Donuts featured in the \"How do you like them apples?\" scene was next door to the pub at the time of the film's release.[20] The Harvard Bar interior scenes were filmed at the Upfront Bar and Grill on Front St. E. in Toronto.[22]/nThe Tasty, at the corner of JFK and Brattle Streets, was the scene of Will and Skylar's first kiss.[23] The Au Bon Pain, where Will and Skylar discuss the former's photographic memory, was at the corner of Dunster Street and Mass Ave.[24]/nThe Boston Public Garden bench on which Will and Sean sat for a scene in the film became a temporary shrine after Williams's death in 2014.[25]/nThe musical score for Good Will Hunting was composed by Danny Elfman, who had previously collaborated with Gus Van Sant on To Die For and would go on to score many of the director's other films.[26] The film also features many songs written and recorded by singer-songwriter Elliott Smith. His song \"Miss Misery\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, but lost to \"My Heart Will Go On\" from Titanic.[27] Elfman's score was also nominated for an Oscar, but lost to Titanic as well. On September 11, 2006, The Today Show used Elfman's song \"Weepy Donuts\" while Matt Lauer spoke during the opening credits./nA soundtrack album for the film was released by Capitol Records on November 18, 1997, though only two of Elfman's cues appear on the release.[28][29]/n\"Afternoon Delight\" by the Starland Vocal Band was featured in the film, but did not appear on the soundtrack album./nA limited edition soundtrack album featuring Elfman's complete score from the film was released by Music Box Records on March 3, 2014. The soundtrack, issued in 1500 copies, includes all of Elfman's cues (including music not featured on the rare Miramax Academy promo) and also contains the songs by Elliott Smith. One of the tracks is Smith's songs with Elfman's arrangements added into the mix.[30]/nIn an early version of the script, Will Hunting was going to be a physics prodigy, but Nobel Laureate in Physics Sheldon Glashow at Harvard told Damon that the subject should be math instead of physics. Glashow referred Damon to his brother-in-law, Daniel Kleitman, a mathematics professor at MIT. Columbia University's physics and math professor Brian Greene at the Tribeca Sloan retrospectively explained that for physics, \"Having some deep insight about the universe [\u2060\u200a\u2060.\u2060\u200a\u2060.\u2060\u200a\u2060.\u2060\u200a\u2060] typically [\u2060\u200a\u2060is\u200a\u2060] a group project in the modern era,\" while \"doing some mathematical theorem is a singular undertaking very often.\"[31][32] In the spring of 1997, Damon and Affleck asked Kleitman to \"speak math to us\" for writing realistic dialogue, so Kleitman invited postdoc Tom Bohman to join him, giving them a \"quick lecture\". When asked for a problem that Will could solve, Kleitman and Bohman suggested the unsolved computer science P versus NP problem, but the movie used other problems./nPatrick O'Donnell, professor of physics at the University of Toronto, served as the mathematical consultant for the film.[33]/nThe main hallway blackboard is used twice to reveal Will Hunting's talent, first to the audience, second to Professor Lambeau. Matt Damon based it on his artist brother Kyle visiting MIT's Infinite Corridor and writing \"an incredibly elaborate, totally fake, version of an equation\" on a blackboard, which lasted for months. Kyle returned to Matt, saying that MIT needed those blackboards \"because these kids are so smart they just need to, you know, drop everything and solve problems!\"[34]/nNear the start of the film, Will sets aside his mop to study a difficult problem posed by Lambeau on the blackboard.[35] The problem has to do with intermediate-level graph theory, but Lambeau describes it as an advanced \"Fourier system.\"/nTo answer the first part of the question, Will chalks up an adjacency matrix:/nTo answer the second part, he determines the number of 3-step walks in the graph, and finds the third power matrix:/nThe third and fourth parts of the question concern generating functions. The other characters are astounded that a janitor shows such facility with matrices./nLambeau subsequently poses a new challenge on the blackboard: state Cayley's formula and \"draw all the homeomorphically irreducible trees with \n\n\n\nn\n=\n10\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n=10}\n\n.\" Will writes eight of the ten trees correctly before Lambeau interrupts.[36]/nIn the film's opening weekend in limited release, it earned $272,912. In its January 1998 wide-release opening weekend, it earned $10,261,471. It went on to gross $138,433,435 in North America and a total worldwide gross of $225,933,435.[3]/nThe film was met with highly positive reviews. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 90 reviews, with an average rating of 8.10/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"It follows a predictable narrative arc, but Good Will Hunting adds enough quirks to the journey \u2013 and is loaded with enough powerful performances \u2013 that it remains an entertaining, emotionally rich drama.\"[37] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[38] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[39]/nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, writing that while the story is \"predictable\", it is \"the individual moments, not the payoff, that make it so effective\".[40] Duane Byrge of The Hollywood Reporter praised the performances of the cast, writing \"The acting is brilliant overall, with special praise to Matt Damon for his ragingly tender portrayal of the boy cursed with genius\".[41] Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle was equally positive, writing \"The glow goes well beyond a radiant performance by Matt Damon ... Intimate, heartfelt and wickedly funny, it's a movie whose impact lingers\".[42] Owen Gleiberman, writing for Entertainment Weekly, gave the film a \"B\", stating \"Good Will Hunting is stuffed \u2013 indeed, overstuffed \u2013 with heart, soul, audacity, and blarney. You may not believe a minute of it, but you don't necessarily want to stop watching\". He also noted Damon's and Williams' chemistry, describing it as \"a quicksilver intercepting each other's thoughts\".[43] Janet Maslin of The New York Times, called the screenplay \"smart and touching\", and praised Van Sant for directing with \"style, shrewdness and clarity\". She also complimented the production design and cinematography, which were able to effortlessly move the viewer from \"classroom to dorm room to neighborhood bar\", in a small setting.[44]/nQuentin Curtis of The Daily Telegraph opined Williams' performance brought \"sharpness and tenderness\", calling the film a \"crowd-pleaser, with bags of charm to spare. It doesn't bear thinking too much about its message ... Damon and Affleck's writing has real wit and vigour, and some depth\".[45] Andrew O'Hehir of Salon stated that despite the \"enjoyable characters\", he thought the film was somewhat superficial, writing \"there isn't a whole lot of movie to take home with you ... many will wake the next morning wondering why, with all that talent on hand, it amounts to so little in the end\".[46] Writing for the BBC, Nev Pierce gave the film four stars out of five, describing the film as \"touching, without being sentimental\", although he felt some scenes were \"odd lapses into self-help speak\".[47] Emanuel Levy of Variety called the film a \"beautifully realized tale ... engaging and often quite touching\". He felt that the film's visual style showcased Van Sant's talent, but the plot was \"quite predictable\".[48]/nSeveral scholars have examined the role of class, religion and the cultural geography of Boston in the film. Jeffrey Herlihy-Mera observed that the residual Catholic\u2013Protestant tensions in Boston are an important backdrop in the film, as Irish Catholics from Southie are aligned against ostensibly Protestant characters who are affiliated with Harvard and MIT.[49] Emmett Winn has argued that character interactions show class conflict and stunted social mobility,[50] while, similarly, David Lipset commented that class inequality is a driving subtext.[51]", "22752379": "Stanislav Konstantinovich Smirnov (Russian: \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0301\u0432 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0301\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 C\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0301\u0432; born 3 September 1970) is a Russian mathematician currently working as a professor at the University of Geneva.

He believed that some of the effects of increased CO2 levels are favourable and not taken into account by climate scientists, such as increased agricultural yield, and further that the positive benefits of CO2 likely outweigh the negative effects.[7][8][9] He was skeptical about the simulation models used to predict climate change, arguing that political efforts to reduce causes of climate change distract from other global problems that should take priority./nDyson was born on 15 December 1923, in Crowthorne in Berkshire, England.[1] He was the son of Mildred (n\u00e9e\u00a0Atkey) and the composer George Dyson, who was later knighted. His mother had a law degree, and after Dyson was born she worked as a social worker.[10] Dyson had one sibling, his older sister, Alice, who remembered him as a boy surrounded by encyclopedias and always calculating on sheets of paper.[11] At the age of four he tried to calculate the number of atoms in the Sun.[12] As a child, he showed an interest in large numbers and in the solar system, and was strongly influenced by the book Men of Mathematics by Eric Temple Bell.[13] Politically, Dyson said he was \"brought up as a socialist\".[14]/nFrom 1936 to 1941 Dyson was a scholar at Winchester College, where his father was Director of Music.[1] At the age of 17 he studied pure mathematics with Abram Besicovitch as his tutor[15] at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he won a scholarship at age 15. During this stay, Dyson also practiced night climbing on the university buildings,[16] and once walked from Cambridge to London in a day with his friend Oscar Hahn, nephew of Kurt Hahn, who was a wheelchair user due to polio.[17]/nAt the age of 19 he was assigned to war work in the Operational Research Section (ORS) of RAF Bomber Command, where he developed analytical methods for calculating the ideal density for bomber formations to help the Royal Air Force bomb German targets during the Second World War.[18][19] After the war, Dyson was readmitted to Trinity College, where he obtained a BA degree in mathematics.[20][21] From 1946 to 1949 he was a fellow of his college, occupying rooms just below those of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, who resigned his professorship in 1947.[22]/nIn 1947 Dyson published two papers in number theory.[23][24] Friends and colleagues described him as shy and self-effacing, with a contrarian streak that his friends found refreshing but intellectual opponents found exasperating.[1] \"I have the sense that when consensus is forming like ice hardening on a lake, Dyson will do his best to chip at the ice\", Steven Weinberg said of him. His friend the neurologist and author Oliver Sacks said: \"A favourite word of Freeman's about doing science and being creative is the word 'subversive'. He feels it's rather important not only to be not orthodox, but to be subversive, and he's done that all his life.\"[7]/nOn G. I. Taylor's advice and recommendation, Dyson moved to the United States in 1947 as a Commonwealth Fellow for postgraduate study with Hans Bethe at Cornell University (1947\u20131948).[25][26] There he made the acquaintance of Richard Feynman. Dyson recognized the brilliance of the flamboyant American and worked with him. He then moved to the Institute for Advanced Study (1948\u20131949), before returning to England (1949\u201351), where he was a research fellow at the University of Birmingham.[27] In 1949, Dyson demonstrated the equivalence of two formulations of quantum electrodynamics (QED): Richard Feynman's diagrams and the operator method developed by Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichir\u014d Tomonaga. He was the first person after their creator to appreciate the power of Feynman diagrams and his paper written in 1948 and published in 1949 was the first to make use of them. He said in that paper that Feynman diagrams were not just a computational tool but a physical theory and developed rules for the diagrams that completely solved the renormalization problem. Dyson's paper and also his lectures presented Feynman's theories of QED in a form that other physicists could understand, facilitating the physics community's acceptance of Feynman's work. J. Robert Oppenheimer, in particular, was persuaded by Dyson that Feynman's new theory was as valid as Schwinger's and Tomonaga's. Also in 1949, in related work, Dyson invented the Dyson series. It was this paper that inspired John Ward to derive his celebrated Ward\u2013Takahashi identity.[28]/nDyson joined the faculty at Cornell as a physics professor in 1951, though he still had no doctorate. In December 1952, Oppenheimer, the director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, offered Dyson a lifetime appointment at the institute, \"for proving me wrong\", in Oppenheimer's words.[29] Dyson remained at the Institute until the end of his career.[30][31] In 1957 he became a US citizen.[a][21][32] From 1957 to 1961 Dyson worked on Project Orion,[33] which proposed the possibility of space-flight using nuclear pulse propulsion. A prototype was demonstrated using conventional explosives, but the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty, in which Dyson was involved and which he supported,[34] permitted only underground nuclear weapons testing,[35] and the project was abandoned in 1965.[36]/nIn 1958 Dyson was a member of the design team under Edward Teller for TRIGA, a small, inherently safe nuclear reactor used throughout the world in hospitals and universities for the production of medical isotopes.[37]/nIn 1966, independently of Elliott H. Lieb and Walter Thirring, Dyson and Andrew Lenard published a paper proving that the Pauli exclusion principle plays the main role in the stability of matter.[38] Hence it is not the electromagnetic repulsion between outer-shell orbital electrons that prevents two stacked wood blocks from coalescing into a single piece, but the exclusion principle applied to electrons and protons that generates the classical macroscopic normal force. In condensed matter physics, Dyson also analysed the phase transition of the Ising model in one dimension and spin waves.[39]/nDyson also did work in a variety of topics in mathematics, such as topology, analysis, number theory and random matrices.[40] In 1973 the number theorist Hugh Lowell Montgomery was visiting the Institute for Advanced Study and had just made his pair correlation conjecture concerning the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. He showed his formula to the mathematician Atle Selberg, who said that it looked like something in mathematical physics and that Montgomery should show it to Dyson, which he did. Dyson recognized the formula as the pair correlation function of the Gaussian unitary ensemble, which physicists have studied extensively. This suggested that there might be an unexpected connection between the distribution of primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11,\u00a0...) and the energy levels in the nuclei of heavy elements such as uranium.[41]/nAround 1979 Dyson worked with the Institute for Energy Analysis on climate studies. This group, under Alvin Weinberg's direction, pioneered multidisciplinary climate studies, including a strong biology group. Also during the 1970s, Dyson worked on climate studies conducted by the JASON defense advisory group.[7]/nDyson retired from the Institute for Advanced Study in 1994.[42] In 1998 he joined the board of the Solar Electric Light Fund. As of 2003[update] he was president of the Space Studies Institute, the space research organization founded by Gerard K. O'Neill; as of 2013 he was on its board of trustees.[43] Dyson was a longtime member of the JASON group.[44]/nDyson won numerous scientific awards, but never a Nobel Prize. Nobel physics laureate Steven Weinberg said that the Nobel committee \"fleeced\" Dyson, but Dyson remarked in 2009, \"I think it's almost true without exception if you want to win a Nobel Prize, you should have a long attention span, get hold of some deep and important problem and stay with it for ten years. That wasn't my style.\"[7] Dyson was a regular contributor to The New York Review of Books, and published a memoir, Maker of Patterns: An Autobiography Through Letters in 2018.[45]/nIn 2012 Dyson published (with William H. Press) a fundamental new result about the prisoner's dilemma in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.[46] He wrote a foreword to a treatise on psychic phenomena in which he concluded that \"ESP is real... but cannot be tested with the clumsy tools of science\".[47]/nDyson married his first wife, the Swiss mathematician Verena Huber, on 11 August 1950. They had two children, Esther and George, before divorcing in 1958. In November 1958 he married Imme Jung (born 1936) and they had four more children: Dorothy, Mia, Rebecca, and Emily Dyson.[7]/nDyson's eldest daughter, Esther, is a digital technology consultant and investor; she has been called \"the most influential woman in all the computer world\".[48] His son George is a historian of science,[49] one of whose books is Project Orion: The Atomic Spaceship 1957\u20131965.[50]/nDyson died on 28 February 2020 at a hospital near Princeton, New Jersey, from complications following a fall. He was 96.[51][52][30]/nDyson admitted his record as a prophet was mixed, but thought it is better to be wrong than vague, and that in meeting the world's material needs, technology must be beautiful and cheap./nMy book The Sun, the Genome, and the Internet (1999) describes a vision of green technology enriching villages all over the world and halting the migration from villages to megacities. The three components of the vision are all essential: the sun to provide energy where it is needed, the genome to provide plants that can convert sunlight into chemical fuels cheaply and efficiently, the Internet to end the intellectual and economic isolation of rural populations. With all three components in place, every village in Africa could enjoy its fair share of the blessings of civilization./nDyson coined the term \"green technologies\", based on biology instead of physics or chemistry, to describe new species of microorganisms and plants designed to meet human needs. He argued that such technologies would be based on solar power rather than the fossil fuels whose use he saw as part of what he calls \"gray technologies\" of industry. He believed that genetically engineered crops, which he described as green, can help end rural poverty, with a movement based in ethics to end the inequitable distribution of wealth on the planet.[53]/nDyson favored the dual origin theory: that life first formed as cells, then enzymes, and finally, much later, genes. This was first propounded by the Russian biochemist, Alexander Oparin.[54] J. B. S. Haldane developed the same theory independently.[55] In Dyson's version of the theory life evolved in two stages, widely separated in time. Because of the biochemistry he regards it as too unlikely that genes could have developed fully blown in one process. Current cells contain adenosine triphosphate or ATP and adenosine 5'-monophosphate or AMP, which greatly resemble each other but have completely different functions. ATP transports energy around the cell, and AMP is part of RNA and the genetic apparatus. Dyson proposed that in a primitive early cell containing ATP and AMP, RNA and replication came into existence only because of the similarity between AMP and RNA. He suggested that AMP was produced when ATP molecules lost two of their phosphate radicals, and then one cell somewhere performed Eigen's experiment and produced RNA.[56]/nThere is no direct evidence for the dual origin theory, because once genes developed, they took over, obliterating all traces of the earlier forms of life. In the first origin, the cells were probably just drops of water held together by surface tension, teeming with enzymes and chemical reactions, and having a primitive kind of growth or replication. When the liquid drop became too big, it split into two drops. Many complex molecules formed in these \"little city economies\" and the probability that genes would eventually develop in them was much greater than in the prebiotic environment.[57]/nIn 1960 Dyson wrote a short paper for the journal Science titled \"Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation\".[58] In it he speculated that a technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilization might surround its native star with artificial structures to maximize the capture of the star's energy. Eventually the civilization would enclose the star, intercepting electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths from visible light downward and radiating waste heat outward as infrared radiation. One method of searching for extraterrestrial civilizations would be to look for large objects radiating in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum./nOne should expect that, within a few thousand years of its entering the stage of industrial development, any intelligent species should be found occupying an artificial biosphere which surrounds its parent star./nDyson conceived that such structures would be clouds of asteroid-sized space habitats, though science fiction writers have preferred a solid structure: either way, such an artifact is often called a Dyson sphere, although Dyson used the term \"shell\". Dyson said that he used the term \"artificial biosphere\" in the article to mean a habitat, not a shape. The general concept of such an energy-transferring shell had been created decades earlier by science fiction writer Olaf Stapledon in his 1937 novel Star Maker, a source which Dyson credited publicly.[59][b]/nDyson also proposed the creation of a Dyson tree, a genetically engineered plant capable of growing inside a comet. He suggested that comets could be engineered to contain hollow spaces filled with a breathable atmosphere, thus providing self-sustaining habitats for humanity in the outer Solar System./nPlants could grow greenhouses\u2026 just as turtles grow shells and polar bears grow fur and polyps build coral reefs in tropical seas. These plants could keep warm by the light from a distant Sun and conserve the oxygen that they produce by photosynthesis. The greenhouse would consist of a thick skin providing thermal insulation, with small transparent windows to admit sunlight. Outside the skin would be an array of simple lenses, focusing sunlight through the windows into the interior\u2026  Groups of greenhouses could grow together to form extended habitats for other species of plants and animals./nI've done some historical research on the costs of the Mayflower's voyage, and on the Mormons' emigration to Utah, and I think it's possible to go into space on a much smaller scale. A cost on the order of $40,000 per person [1978 dollars, $181,600 in 2022 dollars] would be the target to shoot for; in terms of real wages, that would make it comparable to the colonization of America. Unless it's brought down to that level it's not really interesting to me, because otherwise it would be a luxury that only governments could afford./nDyson was interested in space travel since he was a child, reading such science fiction classics as Olaf Stapledon's Star Maker. As a young man, he worked for General Atomics on the nuclear-powered Orion spacecraft. He hoped Project Orion would put men on Mars by 1965, Saturn by 1970. For a quarter-century Dyson was unhappy about how the government conducts space travel:/nThe problem is, of course, that they can't afford to fail. The rules of the game are that you don't take a chance, because if you fail, then probably your whole program gets wiped out./nDyson still hoped for cheap space travel, but was resigned to waiting for private entrepreneurs to develop something new and inexpensive./nNo law of physics or biology forbids cheap travel and settlement all over the solar system and beyond. But it is impossible to predict how long this will take. Predictions of the dates of future achievements are notoriously fallible. My guess is that the era of cheap unmanned missions will be the next fifty years, and the era of cheap manned missions will start sometime late in the twenty-first century.\nAny affordable program of manned exploration must be centered in biology, and its time frame tied to the time frame of biotechnology; a hundred years, roughly the time it will take us to learn to grow warm-blooded plants, is probably reasonable./nA direct search for life in Europa's ocean would today be prohibitively expensive. Impacts on Europa give us an easier way to look for evidence of life there. Every time a major impact occurs on Europa, a vast quantity of water is splashed from the ocean into the space around Jupiter. Some of the water evaporates, and some condenses into snow. Creatures living in the water far enough from the impact have a chance of being splashed intact into space and quickly freeze-dried. Therefore, an easy way to look for evidence of life in Europa's ocean is to look for freeze-dried fish in the ring of space debris orbiting Jupiter.\nFreeze-dried fish orbiting Jupiter is a fanciful notion, but nature in the biological realm has a tendency to be fanciful. Nature is usually more imaginative than we are.  \u2026To have the best chance of success, we should keep our eyes open for all possibilities./nDyson proposed that an immortal group of intelligent beings could escape the prospect of heat death by extending time to infinity while expending only a finite amount of energy.[60] This is also known as the Dyson scenario.[61]/nHis concept \"Dyson's transform\" led to one of the most important lemmas of Olivier Ramar\u00e9's theorem: that every even integer can be written as a sum of no more than six primes.[62]/nThe Dyson series, the formal solution of an explicitly time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation by iteration, and the corresponding Dyson time-ordering operator \n\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {T}}\\,,}\n\n an entity of basic importance in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, are also named after Dyson.[63]/nDyson and Hugh Montgomery discovered an intriguing connection between quantum physics and Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture about the zeros of the zeta function. The primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19,... are described by the Riemann zeta function, and Dyson had previously developed a description of quantum physics based on m by m arrays of totally random numbers.[64] Montgomery and Dyson discovered that the eigenvalues of these matrices are spaced apart in exactly the same manner as Montgomery conjectured for the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function. Andrew Odlyzko has verified the conjecture on a computer, using his Odlyzko\u2013Sch\u00f6nhage algorithm to calculate many zeros.[65]/nThere are in nature one, two, and three dimensional quasicrystals. Mathematicians define a quasicrystal as a set of discrete points whose Fourier transform is also a set of discrete points. Odlyzko has done extensive computations of the Fourier transform of the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function, and they seem to form a one-dimensional quasicrystal. This would in fact follow from the Riemann hypothesis.[66]/nIn number theory and combinatorics rank of a partition of a positive integer is a certain integer associated with the partition. Dyson introduced the concept in a paper published in the journal Eureka. It was presented in the context of a study of certain congruence properties of the partition function discovered by the mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan.[67]/nIn number theory, the crank of a partition is a certain integer associated with the partition in number theory. Dyson first introduced the term without a definition in a 1944 paper in a journal published by the Mathematics Society of Cambridge University.[68] He then gave a list of properties this yet-to-be-defined quantity should have. In 1988, George E. Andrews and Frank Garvan discovered a definition for the crank satisfying the properties Dyson had hypothesized.[69]/nAstrochicken is the name given to a thought experiment Dyson expounded in his book Disturbing the Universe (1979). He contemplated how humanity could build a small, self-replicating automaton that could explore space more efficiently than a crewed craft could. He attributed the general idea to John von Neumann, based on a lecture von Neumann gave in 1948 titled The General and Logical Theory of Automata. Dyson expanded on von Neumann's automata theories and added a biological component.[70]/nDyson suggested that philosophers can be broadly, if simplistically, divided into lumpers and splitters. These roughly correspond to Platonists, who regard the world as made up of ideas, and materialists, who imagine it divided into atoms.[71]/nDyson agreed that technically humans and additional CO2 emissions contribute to warming. However, he felt that the benefits of additional CO2 outweighed any associated negative effects.[8] He said that in many ways increased atmospheric carbon dioxide is beneficial,[72] and that it is increasing biological growth, agricultural yields and forests.[8] He believed that existing simulation models of climate change fail to account for some important factors, and that the results thus contain too great a margin of error to reliably predict trends.[73][74] He argued that political efforts to reduce the causes of climate change distract from other global problems that should take priority[75] and compared acceptance of climate change as real, to religion.[8]/nIn 2009, Dyson criticised James Hansen's climate-change activism. \"The person who is really responsible for this overestimate of global warming is Jim Hansen. He consistently exaggerates all the dangers... Hansen has turned his science into ideology.\"[7] Hansen responded that Dyson \"doesn't know what he's talking about... If he's going to wander into something with major consequences for humanity and other life on the planet, then he should first do his homework- which he obviously has not done on global warming\".[7] Dyson replied that \"[m]y objections to the global warming propaganda are not so much over the technical facts, about which I do not know much, but it's rather against the way those people behave and the kind of intolerance to criticism that a lot of them have.\"[76] Dyson stated in an interview that the argument with Hansen was exaggerated by The New York Times, stating that he and Hansen are \"friends, but we don't agree on everything.\"[77]/nSince originally taking interest in climate studies in the 1970s, Dyson suggested that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere could be controlled by planting fast-growing trees. He calculated that it would take a trillion trees to remove all carbon from the atmosphere.[78][7] In a 2014 interview he said, \"What I'm convinced of is that we don't understand climate\u2026 It will take a lot of very hard work before that question is settled.\"[13]/nDyson was a member of the academic advisory council of the Global Warming Policy Foundation[79]/nAt RAF Bomber Command, Dyson and colleagues proposed removing two gun turrets from Avro Lancaster bombers, to cut the catastrophic losses due to German fighters in the Battle of Berlin. A Lancaster without turrets could fly 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) faster and be much more maneuverable./nAll our advice to the commander in chief [went] through the chief of our section, who was a career civil servant. His guiding principle was to tell the commander in chief things that the commander in chief liked to hear\u2026  To push the idea of ripping out gun turrets, against the official mythology of the gallant gunner defending his crew mates\u2026 was not the kind of suggestion the commander in chief liked to hear./nOn hearing the news of the bombing of Hiroshima:/nI agreed emphatically with Henry Stimson. Once we had got ourselves into the business of bombing cities, we might as well do the job competently and get it over with. I felt better that morning than I had felt for years\u2026  Those fellows who had built the atomic bombs obviously knew their stuff\u2026  Later, much later, I would remember [the downside]./nI am convinced that to avoid nuclear war it is not sufficient to be afraid of it. It is necessary to be afraid, but it is equally necessary to understand. And the first step in understanding is to recognize that the problem of nuclear war is basically not technical but human and historical. If we are to avoid destruction we must first of all understand the human and historical context out of which destruction arises./nIn 1967, in his capacity as a military adviser, Dyson wrote an influential paper on the issue of possible US use of tactical nuclear weapons in the Vietnam War. When a general said in a meeting, \"I think it might be a good idea to throw in a nuke now and then, just to keep the other side guessing\u2026\"[80] Dyson became alarmed and obtained permission to write a report on the pros and cons of using such weapons from a purely military point of view. (This report, Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Southeast Asia, published by the Institute for Defense Analyses, was obtained, with some redactions, by the Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability under the Freedom of Information act in 2002.)[81] It was sufficiently objective that both sides in the debate based their arguments on it. Dyson says that the report showed that, even from a narrow military point of view, the US was better off not using nuclear weapons.[82]/nDyson opposed the Vietnam War, the Gulf War and the invasion of Iraq. He supported Barack Obama in the 2008 US presidential election and The New York Times described him as a political liberal.[7] He was one of 29 leading US scientists who wrote Obama a strongly supportive letter about his administration's 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.[83]/nDyson was raised in what he described as a \"watered-down Church of England Christianity\".[7] He was a nondenominational Christian and attended various churches, from Presbyterian to Roman Catholic. Regarding doctrinal or Christological issues, he said, \"I am neither a saint nor a theologian. To me, good works are more important than theology.\"[84]/nScience and religion are two windows that people look through, trying to understand the big universe outside, trying to understand why we are here. The two windows give different views, but they look out at the same universe. Both views are one-sided, neither is complete. Both leave out essential features of the real world. And both are worthy of respect.\nTrouble arises when either science or religion claims universal jurisdiction, when either religious or scientific dogma claims to be infallible. Religious creationists and scientific materialists are equally dogmatic and insensitive. By their arrogance they bring both science and religion into disrepute. The media exaggerate their numbers and importance. The media rarely mention the fact that the great majority of religious people belong to moderate denominations that treat science with respect, or the fact that the great majority of scientists treat religion with respect so long as religion does not claim jurisdiction over scientific questions.[84]/nDyson partially disagreed with the remark by his fellow physicist Steven Weinberg that \"With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil \u2013 that takes religion.\"[85]/nWeinberg's statement is true as far as it goes, but it is not the whole truth. To make it the whole truth, we must add an additional clause: \"And for bad people to do good things \u2013 that [also] takes religion.\" The main point of Christianity is that it is a religion for sinners. Jesus made that very clear. When the Pharisees asked his disciples, \"Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?\" he said, \"I come to call not the righteous but sinners to repentance.\" Only a small fraction of sinners repent and do good things but only a small fraction of good people are led by their religion to do bad things./nDyson identified himself as agnostic about some of the specifics of his faith.[86][87] For example, in reviewing The God of Hope and the End of the World by John Polkinghorne, Dyson wrote:/nI am myself a Christian, a member of a community that preserves an ancient heritage of great literature and great music, provides help and counsel to young and old when they are in trouble, educates children in moral responsibility, and worships God in its own fashion. But I find Polkinghorne's theology altogether too narrow for my taste. I have no use for a theology that claims to know the answers to deep questions but bases its arguments on the beliefs of a single tribe. I am a practicing Christian but not a believing Christian. To me, to worship God means to recognize that mind and intelligence are woven into the fabric of our universe in a way that altogether surpasses our comprehension./nIn The God Delusion (2006), evolutionary biologist and atheist activist Richard Dawkins singled out Dyson for accepting the Templeton Prize in 2000: \"It would be taken as an endorsement of religion by one of the world's most distinguished physicists.\"[88] In 2000, Dyson declared that he was a (non-denominational) Christian,[84] and he disagreed with Dawkins on several subjects, such as that group selection is less important than individual selection on the subject of evolution.[89]/nAaserud, Finn (17 December 1986). \"Freeman Dyson\".

The goal for researchers then was \"to remove the restrictions implicit in the Foster-Cauer realisations and find conditions on Z equivalent to realisability by a network composed of arbitrary interconnections of positive-valued R, C and L.\"[9]/nBrune coined the term positive-real (PR) for that class of analytic functions that are realisable as an electrical network using passive components.[10] He did not only introduce the mathematical characterization of this function in one complex variable but also demonstrated \"the necessity and sufficiency for the realization of driving point functions of lumped, linear, finite, passive, time-invariant and bilateral network.[11] Brune also showed that if the case is limited to scalar PR functions then there was no other theoretical reason that required ideal transformers in the realisation (transformers limit the practical usefulness of the theory), but was unable to show (as others later did) that transformers can always be avoided.

He was a pioneer in 19th-century Greek astronomy.  Vouris lobbied tirelessly to create an astronomical observatory in Athens.  He was the first director of the National Observatory of Athens.  It was completed in 1846.  Greece reconnected with its Astronomical roots.  It was the first time since antiquity that a country named Greece played a significant role in Astronomy.  He was the first author to publish a university textbook in the field of mathematics since the inception of the new country.[1][2][3]/nHe was born in Vienna to Greek parents.  He studied astronomy and mathematics with some of the most important scientists of the time namely Andreas von Ettingshausen and Joseph Johann von Littrow.  He did significant research in the fields of astrophysics, astronomy, geodesy, meteorology, number theory, calculus, and probability theory.  He moved to Greece and stayed in the country for sixteen years before moving back to Vienna where he lived out the rest of his life.  He played a significant role in the founding of the physics and mathematics department at the University of Athens.  He did significant research on the elliptical orbital calculations of Biela's Comet.  He died at the age of 57 on July 16, 1860, in Vienna.  He is buried in the city.[4][5]/nHe was born in Vienna, Austria.  His father was an entrepreneur.  He was from Ioannina and his mother was from Macedonia.  His father was Greek and enthusiastic about his heritage.  Georgios attended school in Vienna.  He enrolled at the University of Vienna in 1820.  He was eighteen years old.  He initially studied philosophy and law.  He earned a scholarship due to his exceptional performance as a student.  He was unhappy with philosophy and law and pursued astronomy and mathematics instead.  He was taught by Austrian scientist and astronomer Joseph Johann von Littrow.  He was also affiliated with Austrian mathematician and physicist Andreas von Ettingshausen.  He interacted with some of the most brilliant minds of the Austrian scientific community at the time.[3][6]/nGeorgios eventually became a teacher at the Greek school in Vienna from 1826 to 1836.  He continued his studies at the Vienna Observatory under the supervision of Joseph Johann von Littrow.  He was his doctoral student.  In 1832 Georgios published Elliptical orbit calculation of Biela's Comet from 96 observations of the year 1832 (Elliptische bahnbere chung des Biela'schen cometen aus 96 beobachtungen des Jahres 1832).  His paper was a comprehensive overview of the elliptical orbital calculations of Biela's Comet.  Georgios eventually decided to return to Greece.  He initially worked as a translator for the Austrian embassy.  The University of Athens was founded in 1837 and he became a professor of astronomy, physics, and mathematics.[7]  Georgios also extensively contributed to meteorological observation since 1839.  He published a book entitled Meteorological Observations performed in Athens from November 1, 1839 until Jun 30, 1842 in Athens around 1843.  He was profound of the field of astronomy.[8]/nHe lobbied to create the National Observatory of Athens.  He convinced Greek-Austrian entrepreneur and banker Georgios Sinas to fund the massive observatory.  When King Otto learned of the generosity he awarded Georgios Sinas's son the Order of the Redeemer.  The King also chose the architects for the building under Georgio's supervision.  He chose Eduard Schaubert and Theophil Hansen.[9][10]/nVouris was responsible for selecting and purchasing the correct instruments for the newly founded Observatory. The instruments he chose were a refracting telescope 158\u00a0mm in diameter.  It featured 6.2\" (15.8-cm, 250\u00a0cm focal length, f/15)  Pl\u00f6\u00dfl of Vienna. It was created by Simon Pl\u00f6ssl. The second telescope was created by Christoph Starke of Vienna. He worked with optics by Fraunhofer of Munich. It was a meridional telescope 3.7\" large (94mm, f/15, diameter 1m).  Vouris also purchased two pendulums and a timer.   Five small telescopes and a complete line of meteorological equipment.  They were the most advanced scientific instruments of the time.[11][12][13][14]/nThe foundation ceremony was on June 26, 1842.  In a notable speech Georgios discussed Meton of Athens and his astronomical observatory that was in the same city over 2200 years before.[15]  The observatory was fully operational by 1846 and Georgios was the first director.  He continued his scientific work in the field of astrophysics, astronomy, and geodesy.  His articles were periodically published in Astronomische Nachrichten.  He became internationally renowned in the field of astronomy.[16]/nThe astronomer also did not publish several works.  Some of the works included a catalog for the complete determination of 1000 stars peculiar to Greece and the position of the Athens Observatory.  Georgios continued his scientific work.  He determined the geographic coordinates of the Observatory, which formed the basis for the mapping of Greece. He also published a five-volume, complete system of mathematics under the title Mathematical Series.  He did significant research on the movement of Sirius, Neptune, and Mars.[17]  He made specific observations of Mars with the Athens Meridian Circle.  His research was used by American astronomer James Melville Gilliss.[18]/nBy the early 1850s, the popularity of the National Observatory of Athens declined the young Greek state was unstable and the National Observatory of Athens did not receive the funding it required.  Georgios had conflicting views with the leaders of the University of Athens and Ministry of Education.  Vouris fell ill in 1855, he decided to leave the National Observatory of Athens and return to Vienna.  He was replaced by Ioannis Papadakis.  Papadakis was the interim director for a short period of time and was replaced by Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt.[19]/nBack in Vienna Georgios focused the remainder of his life on research.  He continued writing and publishing articles in the field of astronomy.  He was one of the most important Greek astronomers since antiquity.  He published his Memoirs of the Athenian Observatory (Memoiren der Athenienser Sternwarte).  He continued his research and made significant contributions to number theory, calculus, and probability theory.  He significantly contributed to mathematics, physics, and astronomy.  He died at the age of 57 on July 16, 1860.  His unpublished work and library were sold to the observatory.  His library consisted of 663 books and manuscripts and his unpublished works.[17]/nHeliocentrism was forbidden by the Italian and Greek educational systems.  Greek astronomers Chrysanthus Notaras and Methodios Anthrakites were required to follow the established education of the church instituted by Theophilos Corydalleus.  Notaras's professor and advisor was Giovanni Domenico Cassini.   Notaras worked with Cassini at the Paris observatory in the 1600s.  The approved scientific education in the Greek world was secular in nature but promoted Aristotelean physics and the Ptolemaic astronomical system.  The educational system known as Korydalism was the only approved education by the Catholic and Orthodox Church.  Cesare Cremonini was part of the inquisition that persecuted Galileo Galilei.  The church did not allow the idea of Heliocentrism.  The idea was reintroduced by Galileo Galilei and discovered by Aristarchus of Samos.  Both  Aristotle and Ptolemy accepted the geocentric model.  Cesare Cremonini  was Theophilos Corydalleus's doctoral advisor and professor.  Books by Galileo Galilei were on the forbidden books list until the late 1700s.  Notaras built astronomical instruments but did not add Heliocentrism to his book.  He added pictures that some scholars argue are a secret representation of the system.

He was known both for his social practice of mathematics, working with more than 500 collaborators, and for his eccentric lifestyle; Time magazine called him \"The Oddball's Oddball\".[6] He devoted his waking hours to mathematics, even into his later years\u2014indeed, his death came at a mathematics conference in Warsaw.[7] Erd\u0151s's prolific output with co-authors prompted the creation of the Erd\u0151s number, the number of steps in the shortest path between a mathematician and Erd\u0151s in terms of co-authorships./nPaul Erd\u0151s was born on 26 March 1913, in Budapest, Austria-Hungary,[8] the only surviving child of Anna (n\u00e9e Wilhelm) and Lajos Erd\u0151s (n\u00e9 Engl\u00e4nder).[9][10] His two sisters, aged three and five, both died of scarlet fever a few days before he was born.[11] His parents, both Jewish, were high school mathematics teachers. His fascination with mathematics developed early\u2014he was often left home by himself because his father was held captive in Siberia as an Austro-Hungarian prisoner of war during 1914\u20131920,[10] causing his mother to have to work long hours to support their household. His father had taught himself English while in captivity, but mispronounced many words. When Lajos later taught his son to speak English, Paul acquired his unique pronunciations, which he continued to use for the rest of his life.[12]/nHe taught himself to read through mathematics texts that his parents left around in their home. By the age of four, given a person's age, he could calculate in his head how many seconds they had lived.[13] Due to his sisters' deaths, he had a close relationship with his mother, with the two of them reportedly sharing the same bed until he left for college.[14][15]/nWhen he was 16, his father introduced him to two subjects that would become lifetime favourites\u2014infinite series and set theory. In high school, Erd\u0151s became an ardent solver of the problems that appeared each month in K\u00f6MaL, the \"Mathematical and Physical Journal for Secondary Schools\".[16]/nErd\u0151s began studying at the University of Budapest when he was 17 after winning a national examination. At the time, admission of Jews to Hungarian universities was severely restricted under the numerus clausus.[12][17] By the time he was 20, he had found a proof for Chebyshev's theorem.[17] In 1934, at the age of 21, he was awarded a doctorate in mathematics.[17] Erd\u0151s's thesis advisor was Lip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9r, who was also the thesis advisor for John von Neumann, George P\u00f3lya, and Paul (P\u00e1l) Tur\u00e1n. He took up a post-doctoral fellowship at Manchester, as Jews in Hungary were suffering oppression under the authoritarian regime. While there he met Godfrey Harold Hardy and Stan Ulam.[12]/nBecause he was Jewish, Erd\u0151s decided Hungary was dangerous and left the country, relocating to the United States in 1938.[17] Many members of Erd\u0151s's family, including two of his aunts, two of his uncles, and his father, died in Budapest during World War II. His mother was the only one that survived. He was living in America and working at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study at the time.[17][18] However, his fellowship at Princeton only got extended by 6 months rather than the expected year due to Erd\u0151s not conforming to the standards of the place; they found him \"uncouth and unconventional\".[12]/nDescribed by his biographer, Paul Hoffman, as \"probably the most eccentric mathematician in the world,\" Erd\u0151s spent most of his adult life living out of a suitcase.[19] Except for some years in the 1950s, when he was not allowed to enter the United States based on the accusation that he was a Communist sympathizer, his life was a continuous series of going from one meeting or seminar to another.[19] During his visits, Erd\u0151s expected his hosts to lodge him, feed him, and do his laundry, along with anything else he needed, as well as arrange for him to get to his next destination.[19]/nUlam left his post at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison in 1943 to work on the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico with other mathematicians and physicists. He invited Erd\u0151s to join the project, but the invitation was withdrawn when Erd\u0151s expressed a desire to return to Hungary after the war.[12]/nOn 20 September 1996, at the age of 83, he had a heart attack and died while attending a conference in Warsaw.[20] These circumstances were close to the way he wanted to die. He once said,/nI want to be giving a lecture, finishing up an important proof on the blackboard, when someone in the audience shouts out, 'What about the general case?'. I'll turn to the audience and smile, 'I'll leave that to the next generation,' and then I'll keel over.[20]/nErd\u0151s never married and had no children.[9] He is buried next to his mother and father in grave 17A-6-29 in the Jewish Kozma Street Cemetery in Budapest.[21] For his epitaph, he suggested \"I've finally stopped getting dumber.\" (Hungarian: \"V\u00e9gre nem butulok tov\u00e1bb\").[22]/nErd\u0151s's name contains the Hungarian letter \"\u0151\" (\"o\" with double acute accent), but is often incorrectly written as Erdos or Erd\u00f6s either \"by mistake or out of typographical necessity\".[23]/nIn 1934, Erd\u0151s moved to Manchester, England, to be a guest lecturer. In 1938, he accepted his first American position as a scholarship holder at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey, for the next ten years. Despite outstanding papers with Mark Kac and Aurel Wintner on probabilistic number theory, P\u00e1l Tur\u00e1n in approximation theory, and Witold Hurewicz on dimension theory, his fellowship was not continued, and\nErdos was forced to take positions as a wandering scholar at the UPenn, Notre Dame, Purdue, Stanford, and Syracuse.[24] He would not stay long in one place, instead traveling among mathematical institutions until his death./nAs a result of the Red Scare and McCarthyism,[25][26][27] in 1954, the Immigration and Naturalization Service denied Erd\u0151s, a Hungarian citizen, a re-entry visa into the United States.[28] Teaching at the University of Notre Dame at the time, Erd\u0151s could have chosen to remain in the country. Instead, he packed up and left, albeit requesting reconsideration from the U.S. Immigration Services at periodic intervals. At some point he moved to live in Israel, and was given a position for three months at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and then a \"permanent visiting professor\" position at the Technion./nHungary at the time was under the Warsaw Pact with the Soviet Union. Although Hungary limited the freedom of its own citizens to enter and exit the country, in 1956 it gave Erd\u0151s the exclusive privilege of being allowed to enter and exit the country as he pleased./nIn 1963, the U.S. Immigration Service granted Erd\u0151s a visa, and he resumed teaching at and traveling to American institutions. Ten years later, in 1973, the 60-year-old Erd\u0151s voluntarily left Hungary.[29]/nDuring the last decades of his life, Erd\u0151s received at least fifteen honorary doctorates. He became a member of the scientific academies of eight countries, including the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the UK Royal Society.[30] He became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1977.[31] Shortly before his death, he renounced his honorary degree from the University of Waterloo over what he considered to be unfair treatment of colleague Adrian Bondy.[32][33]/nErd\u0151s was one of the most prolific publishers of papers in mathematical history, comparable only with Leonhard Euler; Erd\u0151s published more papers, mostly in collaboration with other mathematicians, while Euler published more pages, mostly by himself.[34] Erd\u0151s wrote around 1,525 mathematical articles in his lifetime,[35] mostly with co-authors. He strongly believed in and practiced mathematics as a social activity,[36] having 511 different collaborators in his lifetime.[37]/nIn his mathematical style, Erd\u0151s was much more of a \"problem solver\" than a \"theory developer\" (see \"The Two Cultures of Mathematics\"[38] by Timothy Gowers for an in-depth discussion of the two styles, and why problem solvers are perhaps less appreciated). Joel Spencer states that \"his place in the 20th-century mathematical pantheon is a matter of some controversy because he resolutely concentrated on particular theorems and conjectures throughout his illustrious career.\"[39] Erd\u0151s never won the highest mathematical prize, the Fields Medal, nor did he coauthor a paper with anyone who did,[40] a pattern that extends to other prizes.[41] He did win the Wolf Prize, \"for his numerous contributions to number theory, combinatorics, probability, set theory and mathematical analysis, and for personally stimulating mathematicians the world over\".[42] In contrast, the works of the three winners after were recognized as \"outstanding\", \"classic\", and \"profound\", and the three before as \"fundamental\" or \"seminal\"./nOf his contributions, the development of Ramsey theory and the application of the probabilistic method especially stand out. Extremal combinatorics owes to him a whole approach, derived in part from the tradition of analytic number theory. Erd\u0151s found a proof for Bertrand's postulate which proved to be far neater than Chebyshev's original one. He also discovered the first elementary proof for the prime number theorem, along with Atle Selberg. However, the circumstances leading up to the proofs, as well as publication disagreements, led to a bitter dispute between Erd\u0151s and Selberg.[43][44] Erd\u0151s also contributed to fields in which he had little real interest, such as topology, where he is credited as the first person to give an example of a totally disconnected topological space that is not zero-dimensional, the Erd\u0151s space.[45]/nErd\u0151s had a reputation for posing new problems as well as solving existing ones \u2013 Ernst Strauss called him \"the absolute monarch of problem posers\".[7]  Throughout his career, Erd\u0151s would offer payments for solutions to unresolved problems.[46] These ranged from $25 for problems that he felt were just out of the reach of the current mathematical thinking (both his and others) up to $10,000[47] for problems that were both difficult to attack and mathematically significant.  Some of these problems have since been solved, including the most lucrative \u2013 Erd\u0151s's conjecture on prime gaps was solved in 2014, and the $10,000 paid.[48]/nThere are thought to be at least a thousand remaining unsolved problems, though there is no official or comprehensive list. The offers remained active despite Erd\u0151s's death; Ronald Graham was the (informal) administrator of solutions, and a solver could receive either an original check signed by Erd\u0151s before his death (for memento only, cannot be cashed) or a cashable check from Graham.[49]/nPerhaps the most mathematically notable of these problems is the Erd\u0151s conjecture on arithmetic progressions:/nIf the sum of the reciprocals of a sequence of integers diverges, then the sequence contains arithmetic progressions of arbitrary length./nIf true, it would solve several other open problems in number theory (although one main implication of the conjecture, that the prime numbers contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions, has since been proved independently as the Green\u2013Tao theorem). The payment for the solution of the problem is currently worth US$5,000.[50]/nThe most familiar problem with an Erd\u0151s prize is likely the Collatz conjecture, also called the 3N\u00a0+\u20091 problem. Erd\u0151s offered $500 for a solution./nErd\u0151s' most frequent collaborators include Hungarian mathematicians Andr\u00e1s S\u00e1rk\u00f6zy (62 papers) and Andr\u00e1s Hajnal (56 papers), and American mathematician Ralph Faudree (50 papers). Other frequent collaborators were the following:[51]/nFor other co-authors of Erd\u0151s, see the list of people with Erd\u0151s number 1 in List of people by Erd\u0151s number./nBecause of his prolific output, friends created the Erd\u0151s number as a tribute. An Erd\u0151s number describes a person's degree of separation from Erd\u0151s himself, based on their collaboration with him, or with another who has their own Erd\u0151s number. Erd\u0151s alone was assigned the Erd\u0151s number of 0 (for being himself), while his immediate collaborators could claim an Erd\u0151s number of 1, their collaborators have Erd\u0151s number at most 2, and so on. Approximately 200,000 mathematicians have an assigned Erd\u0151s number,[52] and some have estimated that 90 percent of the world's active mathematicians have an Erd\u0151s number smaller than 8 (not surprising in light of the small-world phenomenon). Due to collaborations with mathematicians, many scientists in fields such as physics, engineering, biology, and economics also have Erd\u0151s numbers.[53]/nSeveral studies have shown that leading mathematicians tend to have particularly low Erd\u0151s numbers.[54] For example, the roughly 268,000 mathematicians with a known Erd\u0151s number have a median value of 5.[55] In contrast, the median Erd\u0151s number of Fields Medalists is 3.[56] As of 2015, approximately 11,000 mathematicians have an Erd\u0151s number of 2 or less.[57][58] Collaboration distances will necessarily increase over long time scales, as mathematicians with low Erd\u0151s numbers die and become unavailable for collaboration. The American Mathematical Society provides a free online tool to determine the Erd\u0151s number of every mathematical author listed in the Mathematical Reviews catalogue.[59]/nThe Erd\u0151s number was most likely first defined by Casper Goffman,[60] an analyst whose own Erd\u0151s number is 2.[61] Goffman published his observations about Erd\u0151s's prolific collaboration in a 1969 article titled \"And what is your Erd\u0151s number?\"[62]/nJerry Grossman has written that it could be argued that Baseball Hall of Famer Hank Aaron can be considered to have an Erd\u0151s number of 1 because they both autographed the same baseball (for Carl Pomerance) when Emory University awarded them honorary degrees on the same day.[63] Erd\u0151s numbers have also been proposed for an infant, a horse, and several actors.[64]/nAnother roof, another proof./n\u2014 Paul Erd\u0151s[65]/nPossessions meant little to Erd\u0151s; most of his belongings would fit in a suitcase, as dictated by his itinerant lifestyle. Awards and other earnings were generally donated to people in need and various worthy causes. He spent most of his life traveling between scientific conferences, universities and the homes of colleagues all over the world. He earned enough in stipends from universities as a guest lecturer, and from various mathematical awards, to fund his travels and basic needs; money left over he used to fund cash prizes for proofs of \"Erd\u0151s's problems\" (see above). He would typically show up at a colleague's doorstep and announce \"my brain is open\", staying long enough to collaborate on a few papers before moving on a few days later. In many cases, he would ask the current collaborator about whom to visit next./nHis colleague Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi said, \"a mathematician is a machine for turning coffee into theorems\",[66] and Erd\u0151s drank copious quantities; this quotation is often attributed incorrectly to Erd\u0151s,[67] but Erd\u0151s himself ascribed it to R\u00e9nyi.[68] After his mother's death in 1971 he started taking antidepressants and amphetamines, despite the concern of his friends, one of whom (Ron Graham) bet him $500 that he could not stop taking them for a month. Erd\u0151s won the bet, but complained that it impacted his performance: \"You've showed me I'm not an addict. But I didn't get any work done. I'd get up in the morning and stare at a blank piece of paper. I'd have no ideas, just like an ordinary person. You've set mathematics back a month.\"[69] After he won the bet, he promptly resumed his use of Ritalin and Benzedrine.[70]/nHe had his own idiosyncratic vocabulary; although an agnostic atheist,[71][72] he spoke of \"The Book\", a visualization of a book in which God had written down the best and most elegant proofs for mathematical theorems.[73] Lecturing in 1985 he said, \"You don't have to believe in God, but you should believe in The Book.\" He himself doubted the existence of God, whom he called the \"Supreme Fascist\" (SF).[74][75] He accused SF of hiding his socks and Hungarian passports, and of keeping the most elegant mathematical proofs to himself. When he saw a particularly beautiful mathematical proof he would exclaim, \"This one's from The Book!\" This later inspired a book titled Proofs from the Book./nOther idiosyncratic elements of Erd\u0151s's vocabulary include:[70]/nHe gave nicknames to many countries, examples being: the U.S. was \"samland\" (after Uncle Sam)[70] and the Soviet Union was \"joedom\" (after Joseph Stalin).[70]  He claimed that Hindi was the best language because words for old age (bud\u0329d\u0329h\u0101) and stupidity (buddh\u016b) sounded almost the same.[77]/nErd\u0151s signed his name \"Paul Erdos P.G.O.M.\" When he became 60, he added \"L.D.\", at 65 \"A.D.\", at 70 \"L.D.\" (again), and at 75 \"C.D.\"[77]/nErd\u0151s is the subject of at least three books: two biographies (Hoffman's The Man Who Loved Only Numbers and Schechter's My Brain is Open, both published in 1998) and a 2013 children's picture book by Deborah Heiligman (The Boy Who Loved Math: The Improbable Life of Paul Erd\u0151s).[80]/nHe is also the subject of George Csicsery's biographical documentary film N is a Number: A Portrait of Paul Erd\u0151s,[81] made while he was still alive./nIn 2021 the minor planet (asteroid) 405571 (temporarily designated 2005 QE87) was formally named \"Erd\u0151sp\u00e1l\" to commemorate Erd\u0151s, with the citation describing him as \"a Hungarian mathematician, much of whose work centered around discrete mathematics. His work leaned towards solving previously open problems, rather than developing or exploring new areas of mathematics.\"[82] The naming was proposed by \"K. S\u00e1rneczky, Z.

He may also be referred to as Vitale Giordani, Vitale Giordano da Bitonto, and simply Giordano./nGiordano was born in Bitonto, in southeastern Italy, probably on October 15, 1633. As an adolescent he left (or was forced to leave) his city and, after an adventurous youth (that included killing his brother-in-law for calling him lazy) he became a soldier in the Pontifical army. During these adventures he read his first book of mathematics, the Aritmetica prattica by Clavius. At twenty-eight, living in Rome, he decided to devote himself to mathematics. The most important book he studied was Euclid's Elements in the Italian translation by Commandino./nIn Rome he made acquaintance with the renowned mathematicians Giovanni Borelli and Michelangelo Ricci, who became his friends. He was employed for a year as a mathematician by ex-Queen Christina of Sweden during her final stay in Rome. In 1667, a year after its foundation by Louis XIV, he became a lecturer in mathematics at the French Academy in Rome, and in 1685 he gained the chair of mathematics at the prestigious Sapienza University of Rome.

The response was not quite what Papin had hoped for, and Leibniz instead wrote that the use of good logic is the combat of skepticism.[5]/nEhler forged a friendship with fellow Prussian mathematician Heinrich Kuhn. This friendship would then blossom into a correspondence with another mathematician, Leonhard Euler. The correspondence initially began in March 1735 with a letter sent by Ehler to Euler.[6]  The correspondence itself is lost, but we can find the main thread of their relationship with Euler's first letter of response. In the letter, Euler talks of the problem of the Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg, a problem that Ehler brought to Euler's attention. The reason for such an inquiry was the desire by Kuhn and Ehler to encourage mathematical advancements within Prussia. The letter itself reads:/n\u201cYou would render to me and our friend Kuhn a most valuable service, putting us greatly in your debt, most learned sir, if you would send us the solution, which you know well, to the problem of the seven Konigsberg bridges together with a proof. It would prove to an outstanding example of the calculus of position [calculi situs] worthy of your great genius. I have added a sketch of the said bridges\u201d.[7]/nEuler replied to Ehler and Kuhn in April 1736:/n\u201cThus you see, most noble sir, how this type of solution bears little relationship to mathematics and I do not understand why you expect a mathematician to produce it rather than anyone else, for the solution is based on reason alone, and its discovery does not depend on any mathematical principle. Because of this, I do not know why even questions which bear so little relationship to mathematics are solved more quickly by mathematicians than by others. In the meantime most noble sir, you have a assigned this question to the geometry of position but I am ignorant as to what this new discipline involves, and as to which types of problem Leibniz and Wolff expected to see expressed this way.\u201d/nWhile this letter seems to suggest Euler's reluctance to tackle such problem, Kuhn and Ehler had piqued his intellectual curiosity by proposing the solution is part of a new style of mathematics. This enticement is what led the great mathematician to solve the problem and eventually bring to light the new mathematical genre known as geometria situs./nAlong with the correspondence between mathematicians, Ehler also takes his place in history by his post as mayor of Danzig. He was mayor three different times, first in 1741, then in 1745, and finally in 1751.  After overseeing the mayoral office of Danzig for the third and final time, Ehler retired to private life and died in 1753.[2]\nWhile not the most important of historical figures, Carl Gottlieb Ehler contributed to the correspondence of key mathematical figures, and their solutions continued the expansion of such mathematical fields like graph theory and number theory.[8]", "61746452": "Natalia L.

He began his academic career at Trinity College, Cambridge, as a student of Abram Besicovitch, but soon switched to algebraic topology. He received his PhD from the University of Cambridge in 1956.  His thesis, written under the direction of Shaun Wylie, was titled On spectral sequences and self-obstruction invariants. He held the Fielden Chair at the University of Manchester (1964\u20131970), and became Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry at the University of Cambridge (1970\u20131989).

There is a memorial plaque for him in the Chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge./nIn the 1950s, homotopy theory was at an early stage of development, and unsolved problems abounded.  Adams made a number of important theoretical advances in algebraic topology, but his innovations were always motivated by specific problems.  Influenced by the French school of Henri Cartan and Jean-Pierre Serre, he reformulated and strengthened their method of killing homotopy groups in spectral sequence terms, creating the basic tool of stable homotopy theory now known as the Adams spectral sequence. This begins with Ext groups calculated over the ring of cohomology operations, which is the Steenrod algebra in the classical case. He used this spectral sequence to attack the celebrated Hopf invariant one problem, which he completely solved in a 1960 paper by making a deep analysis of secondary cohomology operations.  The Adams\u2013Novikov spectral sequence is an analogue of the Adams spectral sequence using an extraordinary cohomology theory in place of classical cohomology: it is a computational tool of great potential scope./nAdams was also a pioneer in the application of K-theory. He invented the Adams operations in K-theory, which are derived from the exterior powers; they are now also widely used in purely algebraic contexts.  Adams introduced them in a 1962 paper to solve the famous vector fields on spheres problem. Subsequently he used them to investigate the Adams conjecture, which is concerned (in one instance) with the image of the J-homomorphism in the stable homotopy groups of spheres. A later paper of Adams and Michael F. Atiyah uses the Adams operations to give an extremely elegant and much faster version of the above-mentioned Hopf invariant one result./nIn 1974 Adams became the first recipient of the Senior Whitehead Prize, awarded by the London Mathematical Society.[6] He was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1957\u201358.[7]/nAdams had many talented students, and was highly influential in the development of algebraic topology in Britain and worldwide.

It was considered by scholars to have been one of the finest observatories in the Islamic world at the time and the largest in\u00a0Central Asia.[1] Ulugh Beg was subsequently recognized as the most important observational astronomer from the 15th century by many scholars.[6]\u00a0He also built the\u00a0Ulugh Beg Madrasah\u00a0(1417\u20131420) in Samarkand and\u00a0Bukhara, transforming the cities into cultural centers of learning in Central Asia.[7]/nHowever, Ulugh Beg's scientific expertise was not matched by his skills in governance. During his short reign, he failed to establish his power and authority. As a result, other rulers, including his family, took advantage of his lack of control, and he was subsequently overthrown and assassinated.[8]/nHe was a grandson of the great conqueror and king, Timur (Tamerlane) (1336\u20131405), and the oldest son of Shah Rukh, both of whom came from the Turkicized[9] Barlas tribe of Transoxiana (now Uzbekistan). His mother was a noblewoman named Gawhar Shad, daughter of a member of the representative Turkic[10][11] tribal aristocracy, Ghiyasuddin Tarkhan./nUlugh Beg was born in Sultaniyeh during his grandfather's invasion of Persia. He was given the name M\u012brz\u0101 Muhammad T\u0101raghay. Ulugh Beg, the name he most commonly known by, was not truly a personal name, but rather a moniker, which can be loosely translated as \"Great Ruler\" (compare modern Turkish ulu, \"great\", and bey, \"chief\") and is the Turkic equivalent of Timur's Perso-Arabic title Am\u012br-e Kab\u012br.[12]/nAs a child he wandered through a substantial part of the Middle East and India as his grandfather expanded his conquests in those areas. After Timur's death, Shah Rukh moved the empire's capital to Herat (in modern Afghanistan). Sixteen-year-old Ulugh Beg subsequently became the governor of the former capital of Samarkand in 1409. In 1411, he was named the sovereign ruler of the whole of Mavarannahr./nThe teenage ruler set out to turn the city into an intellectual center for the empire. Between 1417 and 1420, he built a madrasa (\"university\" or \"institute\") on Registan Square in Samarkand (currently in Uzbekistan), and he invited numerous Islamic astronomers and mathematicians to study there. The madrasa building still survives. Ulugh Beg's most famous pupil in astronomy was Ali Qushchi (died in 1474). Qadi Zada al-Rumi was the most notable teacher at Ulugh Beg's madrasa and Jamshid al-Kashi, an astronomer, later came to join the staff.[3]/nAstronomy piqued Ulugh Beg's interest when he visited the Maragheh Observatory at a young age. This observatory, located in Maragheh, Iran, is where the well-known astronomer Nasir al-Din al-Tusi practised.[6]/nIn 1428, Ulugh Beg built an enormous observatory, similar to Tycho Brahe's later Uraniborg as well as Taqi al-Din's observatory in Constantinople. Lacking telescopes to work with, he increased his accuracy by increasing the length of his sextant; the so-called Fakhri sextant had a radius of about 36 meters (118 feet) and the optical separability of 180\" (seconds of arc). The Fakhri sextant was the largest instrument at the observatory in Samarkand (an image of the sextant is on the side of this article). There were many other astronomical instruments located at the observatory, but the Fakhri sextant is the most well-known instrument there. The purpose of the Fakhri sextant was to measure the transit altitudes of the stars. This was a measurement of the maximum altitude above the horizon of the stars. It was only possible to use this device to measure the declination of celestial objects.[13] The image, which can be found in this article, shows the remaining portion of the instrument, which consists of the underground, lower portion of the instrument that was not destroyed. The observatory built by Ulugh Beg was the most pervasive and well-known observatory throughout the Islamic world.[3]/nWith the instruments located in the observatory in Samarkand, Ulugh Beg composed a star catalogue consisting of 1018 stars, which is eleven fewer stars than are present in the star catalogue of Ptolemy. Ulugh Beg utilized dimensions from al-Sufi and based his star catalogue on a new analysis that was autonomous from the data used by Ptolemy.[14] Throughout his life as an astronomer, Ulugh Beg came to realize that there were multiple mistakes in the work and subsequent data of Ptolemy that had been in use for many years.[2]/nUsing it, he compiled the 1437 Zij-i-Sultani of 994 stars, generally considered[who?] the greatest star catalogue between those of Ptolemy and Tycho Brahe, a work that stands alongside Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi's Book of Fixed Stars. The serious errors which he found in previous Arabian star catalogues (many of which had simply updated Ptolemy's work, adding the effect of precession to the longitudes) induced him to redetermine the positions of 992 fixed stars, to which he added 27 stars from Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi's catalogue Book of Fixed Stars from the year 964, which were too far south for observation from Samarkand. This catalogue, one of the most original of the Middle Ages, was first edited by Thomas Hyde at Oxford in 1665 under the title Jad\u0101vil-i Mav\u0101zi' S\u0331av\u0101bit, sive, Tabulae Long. ac Lat. Stellarum Fixarum ex Observatione Ulugh Beighi and reprinted in 1767 by G. Sharpe. More recent editions are those by Francis Baily in 1843 in Vol. XIII of the Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society, and by Edward Ball Knobel in Ulugh Beg's Catalogue of Stars, Revised from all Persian Manuscripts Existing in Great Britain, with a Vocabulary of Persian and Arabic Words (1917)./nIn 1437, Ulugh Beg determined the length of the sidereal year as 365.2570370...d = 365d 6h 10m 8s (an error of +58\u00a0seconds). In his measurements over the course of many years he used a 50\u00a0m high gnomon. This value was improved by 28\u00a0seconds in 1525 by Nicolaus Copernicus, who appealed to the estimation of Thabit ibn Qurra (826\u2013901), which had an error of +2\u00a0seconds. However, Ulugh Beg later measured another more precise value of the tropical year as 365d 5h 49m 15s, which has an error of +25\u00a0seconds, making it more accurate than Copernicus's estimate which had an error of +30\u00a0seconds. Ulugh Beg also determined the Earth's axial tilt as 23\u00b030'17\" in the sexagesimal system of degrees, minutes and seconds of arc, which in decimal notation converts to 23.5047\u00b0.[15]/nIn mathematics, Ulugh Beg wrote accurate trigonometric tables of sine and tangent values correct to at least eight decimal places.[16]/nOnce Ulugh Beg became governor of Samarqand, he fostered diplomatic relations with the Yongle emperor of the Ming dynasty.[17] In 1416, Ming envoys Chen Cheng and Lu An presented silk and silver stuffs to Ulugh Beg on behalf of the Yongle emperor.[17] In 1419, The Timurid sent his own emissaries, Sultan-Shah and Muhammad Bakhshi, to the Ming court.[18] Ulugh Beg's emissaries came across Ghiy\u0101th al-d\u012bn Naqq\u0101sh and other envoys representing Shah Rukh, Prince Baysunghur, and other Timurid authorities in Beijing; however, they stayed at separate hostelries.[19] Ghiy\u0101th al-d\u012bn Naqq\u0101sh even saw the Yongle emperor riding a black horse with feet which had been gifted by Ulugh Beg.[20]/nIn 1439, the Zhengtong emperor ordered an artist to produce a painting of a black horse with white feet and a white forehead that had been sent by Ulugh Beg.[21] Six years later, the Ming emperor sent a letter to Ulugh Beg in order to express his gratitude for all the \"tribute\"  from Samarqand.[21]  The emperor sent \"vessels made of gold and jade, a spear with a dragon's head, a fine horse with saddle, and variegated gold-embroidered silk stuffs\" to Ulugh Beg, as well as silk stuffs and garments for the Timurid prince's family.[21]/nIn 1447, upon learning of the death of his father Shah Rukh, Ulugh Beg went to Balkh. Here, he heard that Ala al-Dawla, the son of his late brother Baysunghur, had claimed the rulership of the Timurid Empire in Herat. Consequently, Ulugh Beg marched against Ala al-Dawla and met him in battle at Murghab. He defeated his nephew and advanced toward Herat, massacring its people in 1448. However, Abul-Qasim Babur Mirza, Ala al-Dawla's brother, came to the latter's aid and defeated Ulugh Beg.[13]/nUlugh Beg retreated to Balkh where he found that its governor, his oldest son Abdal-Latif Mirza, had rebelled against him. Another civil war ensued.[13] Abdal-Latif recruited troops to meet his father's army on the banks of the Amu Darya river. However, Ulugh Beg was forced to retreat to Samarkand before any fighting took place, having heard news of turmoil in the city. Abdal-Latif soon reached Samarkand and Ulugh Beg involuntarily surrendered to his son. Abd-al-Latif released his father from custody, allowing him to make pilgrimage to Mecca. However, he ensured Ulugh Beg never reached his destination, having him, as well as his brother Abdal-Aziz assassinated in 1449.[22][23][24]/nEventually, Ulugh Beg's reputation was rehabilitated by his nephew, Abdallah Mirza (1450\u20131451), who placed his remains at Timur's feet in the Gur-e-Amir in Samarkand,[25] where they were found by Soviet archaeologists in 1941./nUlugh Beg had thirteen wives:/nSoviet anthropologist Mikhail M. Gerasimov reconstructed the face of Ulugh Beg. Like his grandfather Timurlane, Ulugh Beg is close to the Mongoloid type with slightly Europoid features.[27][28] His father Shah Rukh had predominantly Caucasoid features, with no obvious Mongoloid feature.[29][30]", "46509358": "Clifford John Earle, Jr. (November 3, 1935 \u2013 June 12, 2017) was an American mathematician who specialized in complex variables and Teichm\u00fcller spaces./nEarle was born in Racine, Wisconsin in 1935.[1] He received his bachelor's degree from Swarthmore College in 1957, his master's degree from Harvard University in 1958, and his Ph.D. in 1962 under Lars Ahlfors with thesis Teichm\u00fcller Spaces of Groups of the Second Kind.[2] From 1963 to 1965 he was at the Institute for Advanced Study.

He was the first astronomer who determined reliable values for the distance from the sun to another star by the method of parallax. Certain important mathematical functions were named Bessel functions after Bessel's death, though they had originally been discovered by Daniel Bernoulli before being generalised by Bessel./nBessel was born in Minden, Westphalia, then capital of the Prussian administrative region Minden-Ravensberg, as second son of a civil servant into a large family. At the age of 14 he left the school, because he did not like the education in latin language, and apprenticed in the import-export concern Kulenkamp at Bremen. The business's reliance on cargo ships led him to turn his mathematical skills to problems in navigation. This in turn led to an interest in astronomy as a way of determining longitude./nBessel came to the attention of Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers, a practising physician of Bremen and well-known astronomer, by producing a refinement on the orbital calculations for Halley's Comet in 1804, using old observation data taken from Thomas Harriot and Nathaniel Torporley in 1607.[1] Franz Xaver von Zach edited the results in his journal Monatliche Correspondenz./nHaving finished his commercial education, Bessel left Kulenkamp in 1806 and became assistant at Johann Hieronymus Schr\u00f6ter's private observatory in Lilienthal near Bremen as successor of Karl Ludwig Harding. There he worked on James Bradley's stellar observation data to produce precise positions for some 3,222 stars.[1]/nDespite lacking any higher education, especially at university, Bessel was appointed director of the newly founded K\u00f6nigsberg Observatory by King Frederick William III of Prussia in January 1810, at the age of 25, and remained in that position until his death. By reason of lacking any academical degree some colleagues of the Philosophical Faculty disputed Bessel's right to teach mathematics. Therefore he turned to his fellow Carl Friedrich Gauss, who provided the award of an honorary doctor degree from the University of G\u00f6ttingen in March 1811. Both scientists were in correspondence from 1804 to 1843. In 1837 they got in quarrel about Gauss' habit of very slow publication.[2]/nIn 1842 Bessel took part in the annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Manchester, accompanied by the geophysicist Georg Adolf Erman and the mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, where he gave a report on astronomical clocks.[3]/nBessel married Johanna Hagen, the daughter of the chemist and pharmacist Karl Gottfried Hagen who was the uncle of the physician and biologist Hermann August Hagen and the hydraulic engineer Gotthilf Hagen, the latter also Bessel's student and assistant from 1816 to 1818. The physicist Franz Ernst Neumann, Bessel's close companion and colleague, was married to Johanna Hagen's sister Florentine. Neumann introduced Bessel's exacting methods of measurement and data reduction into his mathematico-physical seminar, which he co-directed with Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi at K\u00f6nigsberg.[4] These exacting methods had a lasting impact upon the work of Neumann's students and upon the Prussian conception of precision in measurement./nBessel had two sons and three daughters. His elder son became an architect but died suddenly in 1840 aged 26; his younger son died shortly after birth. His eldest daughter, Marie, married the physicist Georg Adolf Erman, member of the scholar family Erman. One of their sons in turn was the renowned Egyptologist Adolf Erman. His third daughter Johanna married the politician Adolf Hermann Hagen; one of their sons was the physicist Ernst Bessel Hagen, and the mathematician Erich Bessel-Hagen was a grandson of them. Bessel was godfather of Adolf von Baeyer, son of his collaborator Johann Jacob Baeyer./nAfter several months of illness Bessel died in March 1846 at his observatory from retroperitoneal fibrosis.[5][6]/nWhile the observatory was still in construction Bessel elaborated the Fundamenta Astronomiae based on Bradley's observations. As a preliminary result he produced tables of atmospheric refraction that won him the Lalande Prize from the French Academy of Sciences in 1811. The K\u00f6nigsberg Observatory began operation in 1813./nStarting in 1819, Bessel determined the position of over 50,000 stars using a meridian circle from Reichenbach, assisted by some of his qualified students. The most prominent of them was Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander, his successors were Otto August Rosenberger and August Ludwig Busch./nBessel determined the first reliable value for the distance between a star and the solar system using the method of stellar parallax. In 1838 he published a parallax of 0.314 arcseconds for 61 Cygni, which, given the diameter of the Earth's orbit, indicated that the star is 10.3 ly away.[7][8][9]  Compared with the current measurement of 11.4 ly, Bessel's figure had an error of 9.6%. Thanks to these results astronomers had not only enlarged the vision of the universe well beyond the cosmic magnitude, but after the discovery in 1728 by James Bradley of the aberration of light a second empirical evidence of the Earth's relative movement was produced.[10] A short time later Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve and Thomas Henderson reported the parallaxes of Vega and Alpha Centauri./nBessel's precise measurements with a new meridian circle from Adolf Repsold allowed him to notice deviations in the motions of Sirius and Procyon, which he deduced must be caused by the gravitational attraction of unseen companions.[11][12][13]\nHis announcement of Sirius's \"dark companion\" in 1844 was the first correct claim of a previously unobserved companion by positional measurement, and eventually led to the discovery of Sirius B by Alvan Graham Clark in 1862, the first discovery of a white dwarf. John Martin Schaeberle discovered Procyon B in 1896./nBessel was the first scientist who realized the effect later called personal equation, that several simultaneously observing persons determine slightly different values, especially recording the transit time of stars.[14]/nIn 1824, Bessel developed a new method for calculating the circumstances of eclipses using the so-called Besselian elements.  His method simplified the calculation to such an extent, without sacrificing accuracy, that it is still in use today.[15]/nOn Bessel's proposal in 1825 the Prussian Academy of Sciences started the edition of the Berliner Akademische Sternkarten (Berlin Academic Star Charts) as an international project with Johann Franz Encke as executive editor. One unpublished new chart enabled Johann Gottfried Galle to find Neptune near the position calculated by Le Verrier in September 1846 at Berlin Observatory./nIn the second decade of the 19th century while studying the dynamics gravitational systems as multi-body problem, Bessel developed what are now known as Bessel functions. Critical for the solution of certain differential equations, these functions are used throughout both classical and quantum physics./nBessel is responsible for the correction to the formula for the sample variance estimator named in his honour. This is the use of the factor n\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 in the denominator of the formula, rather than just n. This occurs when the sample mean rather than the population mean is used to centre the data and since the sample mean is a linear combination of the data the residual to the sample mean overcounts the number of degrees of freedom by the number of constraint equations \u2014 in this case one./nLike numerous astronomers of his time Bessel dealt on the field of geodesy, too,[16]\nfirst theoretically, when he published a method for solving the main geodetic problem.[17]\nIn 1830 he got the royal order for the survey of East Prussia with the purpose to connect the yet existing Prussian and Russian triangulation networks. This work was carried out in cooperation with Johann Jacob Baeyer, then major of the Prussian army; the final report was published in 1838.[18]\nHe also obtained an estimate of increased accuracy for the Earth's ellipsoid, nowadays called the Bessel ellipsoid, based on several arc measurements.[19][20]/nBessel was one of the first members of the Order Pour le Merite (Civil class) when it was established in 1842.[29]/nThe first cosmic object named after Bessel is the largest crater in the Moon's Mare Serenitatis.[30] The main-belt asteroid 1552\u00a0Bessel was named at the centenary of the parallaxe determination in 1938.[31]/nGeographical commemorations are two fjords in Greenland, Bessel Fjord, NE Greenland and Bessel Fjord, NW Greenland.", "31698235": "Walter Edwin Arnoldi (December 14, 1917 \u2013 October 5, 1995) was an American engineer mainly known for the Arnoldi iteration, an eigenvalue algorithm used in numerical linear algebra.

His Essai de perspective (\"Essay on Perspective\"), published in 1711, was praised by the influential Swiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli.[1] In The Hague, 's Gravesande also helped to establish the Journal litt\u00e9raire (\"Literary journal\"), a learned periodical first published in 1713.[2]/nIn 1715, 's Gravesande visited London as part of a Dutch delegation sent to welcome the Hanoverian succession in Great Britain.[2] In London, 's Gravesande met both King George I and Isaac Newton, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.[3] In 1717 he became professor of mathematics and astronomy in Leiden.

's Gravesande's book was soon translated into English by John Theophilus Desaguliers, curator of experiments for the Royal Society.[4]/nIn 1721, 's Gravesande became involved in a public controversy over whether the German inventor Johann Bessler, known as Councillor Orffyreus, had created a genuine perpetual motion machine. 's Gravesande at first argued for the feasibility of perpetual motion based on the conservation of the scalar quantity mv (mass multiplied by speed), which he erroneously believed was implied by Newtonian mechanics.[5] However, in 1722 he published the results of a series of experiments in which brass balls were dropped from varying heights onto a soft clay surface.  He found that a ball with twice the speed of another would leave an indentation four times as deep, from which he concluded that the correct expression for the \"live force\" of a body in motion (currently called \"kinetic energy\") is proportional to mv2.[5]/nEven though those results invalidated his original argument for the feasibility of perpetual motion, 's Gravesande continued to defend Bessler's work, claiming that Bessler might have discovered some new \"active principle\" of nature that allowed his wheels to keep turning.  Similar views were defended at the time by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Johann Bernoulli, and others, but the modern consensus is that Bessler was perpetrating a deliberate hoax.[5] Russian Tsar Peter the Great was interested in Bessler's wheel and sought 's Gravesande's advice on the subject.[6]/n's Gravesande communicated his results on the impact of falling weights to \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet.

The interpretation of 's Gravesande's and Poleni's results led to a controversy with Samuel Clarke and other Newtonians that became a part of the so-called \"vis viva dispute\" in the history of classical mechanics.[7]/n's Gravesande is also remembered for his invention of a simple experiment demonstrating thermal expansion, which has been used in physics education since.  This is known today as \"'s Gravesande's experiment\" or \"'s Gravesande's ring\".  The apparatus consists of a small metal ball on a chain or handle, and a metal ring on a stand.  The ring is just big enough so that when the ring and ball are at the same temperature, the ball fits through the ring.  However, if the ball is heated by dipping it into boiling water or playing the flame of a spirit lamp over it, the metal will expand, and the ball will no longer fit through the ring.

A year later, the Minister of Ceremonies assigned him to review alternative means of calculating eclipses./nThroughout his service under the Han government, Liu Hong held various positions, including: Internuncio (\u8b01\u8005), gucheng menhou (\u7a40\u57ce\u9580\u5019), Commandant of the East District of Kuaiji (\u6703\u7a3d\u6771\u90e8\u90fd\u5c09), Administrator of Shanyang (\u5c71\u967d\u592a\u5b88) and Chancellor of Qucheng (\u66f2\u57ce\u76f8).[2]", "66497882": "Wallace Smith Martindale III (born August 1930 in Philadelphia) is an American mathematician, known for Martindale's Theorem (1969) and the Martindale ring of quotients introduced in the proof of the theorem.[1][2][3] His 1969 paper generalizes Posner's theorem and a theorem of Amitsur[4] and gives an independent, unified proof of the two theorems.[1]/nMartindale received his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1958 from the University of Pennsylvania.[5] He became a professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and retired there as professor emeritus in 1996.[6]/nHe is the father of two daughters.

Soon after, Anna Howard Shaw, president of the National American Woman's Suffrage Association asked Brewster Owens to return to Kansas as her personal representative. Working there throughout 1912, Brewster Owens bore witness to the state's ratification of the suffrage amendment - by 16,000 votes, the greatest majority of any state up until that point.

This was in fact a table of values of the integral of the secant function, and was the essential step needed to make practical both the making and the navigational use of Mercator charts./nWright was born at Garveston in Norfolk and educated at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he became a fellow from 1587 to 1596. In 1589 the college granted him leave after Elizabeth I requested that he carry out navigational studies with a raiding expedition organised by the Earl of Cumberland to the Azores to capture Spanish galleons. The expedition's route was the subject of the first map to be prepared according to Wright's projection, which was published in Certaine Errors in 1599. The same year, Wright created and published the first world map produced in England and the first to use the Mercator projection since Gerardus Mercator's original 1569 map./nNot long after 1600 Wright was appointed as surveyor to the New River project, which successfully directed the course of a new man-made channel to bring clean water from Ware, Hertfordshire, to Islington, London. Around this time, Wright also lectured mathematics to merchant seamen, and from 1608 or 1609 was mathematics tutor to the son of James I, the heir apparent Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, until the latter's very early death at the age of 18 in 1612. A skilled designer of mathematical instruments, Wright made models of an astrolabe and a pantograph, and a type of armillary sphere for Prince Henry. In the 1610 edition of Certaine Errors he described inventions such as the \"sea-ring\" that enabled mariners to determine the magnetic variation of the compass, the sun's altitude and the time of day in any place if the latitude was known; and a device for finding latitude when one was not on the meridian using the height of the pole star./nApart from a number of other books and pamphlets, Wright translated John Napier's pioneering 1614 work which introduced the idea of logarithms from Latin into English. This was published after Wright's death as A Description of the Admirable Table of Logarithmes (1616). Wright's work influenced, among other persons, Dutch astronomer and mathematician Willebrord Snellius; Adriaan Metius, the geometer and astronomer from Holland; and the English mathematician Richard Norwood, who calculated the length of a degree on a great circle of the earth using a method proposed by Wright./nThe younger son of Henry and Margaret Wright, Edward Wright was born in the village of Garveston in Norfolk,[1] East Anglia, and was baptised there on 8 October 1561. It is possible that he followed in the footsteps of his elder brother Thomas (died 1579) and went to school in Hardingham.[2] The family was of modest means,[3] and he matriculated at Gonville and Caius College, University of Cambridge, on 8 December 1576[2] as a sizar.[4][5] Sizars were students of limited means who were charged lower fees and obtained free food and/or lodging and other assistance during their period of study, often in exchange for performing work at their colleges./nWright was conferred a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in 1580\u20131581. He remained a scholar at Caius, receiving his Master of Arts (M.A.) there in 1584, and holding an fellowship between 1587 and 1596.[6] At Cambridge, he was a close friend of Robert Devereux, later the Second Earl of Essex, and met him to discuss his studies even in the weeks before Devereux's rebellion against Elizabeth I in 1600\u20131601. In addition, he came to know the mathematician Henry Briggs; and the soldier and astrologer Christopher Heydon, who was also Devereux's friend.[2][4] Heydon later made astronomical observations with instruments Wright made for him.[7]/nIn 1589, two years after being appointed to his fellowship, Wright was requested by Elizabeth I to carry out navigational studies with a raiding expedition organised by the Earl of Cumberland to the Azores to capture Spanish galleons. The Queen effectively ordered Caius to grant him leave of absence for this purpose, although the college expressed this more diplomatically by granting him a sabbatical \"by Royal mandate\".[8] Wright participated in the confiscation of \"lawful\" prizes from the French, Portuguese and Spanish \u2013 Derek Ingram, a life fellow of Caius, has called him \"the only Fellow of Caius ever to be granted sabbatical leave in order to engage in piracy\".[8] Wright sailed with Cumberland in the Victory from Plymouth on 8 June 1589; they returned to Falmouth on 27 December of the same year.[2] An account of the expedition is appended to Wright's work Certaine Errors of Navigation (1599), and while it refers to Wright in the third person it is believed to have been written by him.[4]/nIn Wright's account of the Azores expedition, he listed as one of the expedition's members a \"Captaine Edwarde Carelesse, alias Wright, who in S. Frauncis Drakes West-Indian voiage was Captaine of the Hope\". In another work, The Haven-finding Art (1599) (see below), Wright stated that \"the time of my first employment at sea\" was \"now more than tenne yeares since\".[2] The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography asserts that during the expedition Wright called himself \"Captain Edward Carelesse\", and that he was also the captain of the Hope in Sir Francis Drake's voyage of 1585\u20131586 to the West Indies, which evacuated Sir Walter Raleigh's Colony of Virginia. One of the colonists was the mathematician Thomas Harriot, and if the Dictionary is correct it is probable that on the return journey to England Wright and Harriot became acquainted and discussed navigational mathematics.[4] However, in a 1939 article, E.J.S. Parsons and W.F. Morris note that in Capt. Walter Bigges and Lt. Crofts' book A Summarie and True Discourse of Sir Frances Drakes West Indian Voyage (1589),[9] Edward Careless was referred to as the commander of the Hope, but Wright was not mentioned. Further, while Wright spoke several times of his participation in the Azores expedition, he never alluded to any other voyage. Although the reference to his \"first employment\" in The Haven-finding Art suggests an earlier venture, there is no evidence that he went to the West Indies. Gonville and Caius College holds no records showing that Wright was granted leave before 1589.[2] There is nothing to suggest that Wright ever went to sea again after his expedition with the Earl of Cumberland.[4]/nWright resumed his Cambridge fellowship upon returning from the Azores in 1589,[3] but it appears that he soon moved to London for he was there with Christopher Heydon making observations of the sun between 1594 and 1597, and on 8 August 1595 Wright married Ursula Warren (died 1625), a daughter of Augustine Bernher, at the parish church of St. Michael, Cornhill, in the City of London.[10] They had a son, Samuel (1596\u20131616), who was himself admitted as a sizar[4] at Caius on 7 July 1612.[11] The St. Michael parish register also contains references to other children of Wright, all of whom died before 1617.[11] Wright resigned his fellowship in 1596.[4]/nWright helped the mathematician and globe maker Emery Molyneux to plot coastlines on his terrestrial globe, and translated some of the explanatory legends into Latin.[14] Molyneux's terrestrial and celestial globes, the first to be manufactured in England, were published in late 1592 or early 1593, and Wright explained their use in his 1599 work Certaine Errors in Navigation. He dedicated the book to Cumberland, to whom he had presented a manuscript of the work in 1592,[15][16] stating in the preface it was through Cumberland that he \"was first moved, and received maintenance to divert my mathematical studies, from a theorical speculation in the Universitie, to the practical demonstration of the use of Navigation\".[17]/nThe navigation errors addressed by Wright in Certaine Errors in Navigation had been previously treated by Pedro Nunes, whose works had been compiled in Petri Nonii Salaciensis Opera in 1566 (later expanded, corrected and re-edited as De arte adque ratione navigandi in 1573).\nThis is pointed out by Wright himself in the Preface:/nYet it may be, I shall be blamed by some, as being to busie a fault-finder myself. For when they shall, see their Charts and other instruments controlled which so long time have gone for current, some of them perhappes will scarcely with pacience endure it. But they may be pacified, if not by reason of the good that ensueth hereupon, yet towards me at the least because the errors I poynt at in the chart, have beene heretofore poynted out by others, especially by Petrus Nonius, out of whom most part of the first Chapter of the Treatise following is almost worde for worde translated;/nThis appeal to the authority of Pedro Nunes and the fact that the first chapter treats the Faults in the common Sea Chart, With Rumbes expressed by right lines and degrees of latitude, everywhere equal, show Nune's influence in Wright's work. In addition, the effect of following a rhumb line course on the surface of a globe was first discussed by Pedro Nunes in 1537 in his Treatise in Defense of the Marine Chart. In this work, Nunes proposes the construction of a nautical atlas composed of several large-scale sheets in the cylindrical equidistant projection as a way to minimize distortion of directions. If these sheets were brought to the same scale and assembled, they would approximate the Mercator projection, later introduced by Gerardus Mercator in 1569. Mercator never explained the method of construction of the projection bearing his name, nor how he arrived at it. Various hypotheses have been tendered over the years, but in any case Mercator's friendship with Pedro Nunes and his access to the loxodromic tables Nunes created likely aided his efforts.[18][19]  Mercator's projection was advantageous for nautical purposes as it represented lines of constant true bearing or true course (rhumb lines), as straight lines./nIn Certaine errors of navigation, Wright improved and diversified Nunes' charting method,[18] thus explaining the construction and use of the Mercator projection. As Wright himself puts it in Chapter 2:/nBy help of this planisphaere with the meridians, rumbes, and parallels thus described therein, the rumbs may much more easily & truly be drawn in the globe then by these mechanical wayes which Petrus Nonius [Pedro Nunes] teacheth cap. 26 lib. 2 de obser. Reg. et Instr. Geom../nIn order to achieve this, Wright introduces the method for dividing the meridian, an explanation of how he had constructed a table for the division, and the uses of this information for navigation. On a globe, circles of latitude (also known as parallels) get smaller as they move away from the Equator towards the North or South Pole. Thus, in the Mercator projection, when a globe is \"unwrapped\" on to a rectangular map, the parallels need to be stretched to the length of the Equator. In addition, parallels are further apart as they approach the poles. Wright compiled a table with three columns. The first two columns contained the degrees and minutes of latitudes for parallels spaced 10\u00a0minutes apart on a sphere, while the third column had the parallel's projected distance from the Equator. Any cartographer or navigator could therefore lay out a Mercator grid for himself by consulting the table.[20] Wright explained:/nI first thought of correcting so many gross errors ... in the sea chart, by increasing the distances of the parallels, from the equinoctial towards the poles, in such sort, that at every point of latitude in the chart, a part of the meridian might have the same proportion to the like part of the parallel, that it has in the globe.[21]/nWhile the first edition of Certaine Errors contained an abridged table six pages in length, in the second edition which appeared in 1610 Wright published a full table across 23 pages with figures for parallels at one-minute intervals. The table is remarkably accurate \u2013 American geography professor Mark Monmonier wrote a computer program to replicate Wright's calculations, and determined that for a Mercator map of the world 3 feet (0.91\u00a0m) wide, the greatest discrepancy between Wright's table and the program was only 0.00039 inches (0.0099\u00a0mm) on the map.[22] In the second edition Wright also incorporated various improvements, including proposals for determining the magnitude of the Earth and reckoning common linear measurements as a proportion of a degree on the Earth's surface \"that they might not depend on the uncertain length of a barley-corn\"; a correction of errors arising from the eccentricity of the eye when making observations using the cross-staff; amendments in tables of declinations and the positions of the sun and the stars, which were based on observations he had made together with Christopher Heydon using a 6-foot (1.8\u00a0m) quadrant; and a large table of the variation of the compass as observed in different parts of the world, to show that it is not caused by any magnetic pole. He also incorporated a translation of Rodrigo Zamorano's Compendio de la Arte de Navegar (Compendium of the Art of Navigation, Seville, 1581; 2nd ed., 1588).[23]/nWright was prompted to publish the book after two incidents of his text, which had been prepared some years earlier, being used without attribution. He had allowed his table of meridional parts to be published by Thomas Blundeville in his Exercises (1594)[24] and in William Barlow's The Navigator's Supply (1597),[25] although only Blundeville acknowledged Wright by name. However, an experienced navigator, believed to be Abraham Kendall, borrowed a draft of Wright's manuscript and, unknown to him, made a copy of it which he took on Sir Francis Drake's 1595 expedition to the West Indies. In 1596 Kendall died at sea. The copy of Wright's work in his possession was brought back to London and wrongly believed to be by Kendall, until the Earl of Cumberland passed it to Wright and he recognised it as his work.[26] Also around this time, the Dutch cartographer Jodocus Hondius borrowed Wright's draft manuscript for a short time after promising not to publish its contents without his permission. However, Hondius then employed Wright's calculations without acknowledging him for several regional maps, and in his world map published in Amsterdam in 1597. This map is often referred to as the \"Christian Knight Map\" for its engraving of a Christian knight battling sin, the flesh and the Devil. Although Hondius sent Wright a letter containing a faint apology, Wright condemned Hondius's deceit and greed in the preface to Certaine Errors.[27] He wryly commented: \"But the way how this [Mercator projection] should be done, I learned neither of Mercator, nor of any man els. And in that point I wish I had beene as wise as he in keeping it more charily to myself\".[28]/nThe first map to be prepared according to Wright's projection was published in his book, and showed the route of Cumberland's expedition to the Azores. A manuscript version of this map is preserved at Hatfield House; it is believed to have been drawn about 1595.[29] Following this, Wright created a new world map, the first map of the globe to be produced in England and the first to use the Mercator projection since Gerardus Mercator's 1569 original. Based on Molyneux's terrestrial globe, it corrected a number of errors in the earlier work by Mercator. The map, often called the Wright\u2013Molyneux Map, first appeared in the second volume of Richard Hakluyt's The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation (1599).[30] Unlike many contemporary maps and charts which contained fantastic speculations about unexplored lands, Wright's map has a minimum of detail and blank areas wherever information was lacking. The map was one of the earliest to use the name \"Virginia\".[31] Shakespeare alluded to the map in Twelfth Night (1600\u20131601),[32] when Maria says of Malvolio: \"He does smile his face into more lynes, than is in the new Mappe, with the augmentation of the Indies.\"[33] Another world map, larger and with updated details, appeared in the second edition of Certaine Errors (1610).[33]/nWright translated into English De Havenvinding (1599) by the Flemish mathematician and engineer Simon Stevin, which appeared in the same year as The Haven-Finding Art, or the Way to Find any Haven or Place at Sea, by the Latitude and Variation. He also wrote the preface to physician and scientist William Gilbert's great work De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure (The Magnet, Magnetic Bodies, and the Great Magnet the Earth, 1600),[34] in which Gilbert described his experiments which led to the conclusion that the Earth was magnetic, and introduced the term electricus to describe the phenomenon of static electricity produced by rubbing amber (called \u0113lectrum in Classical Latin, derived from '\u03ae\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (elektron) in Ancient Greek).[35] According to the mathematician and physician Mark Ridley,[36] chapter 12 of book 4 of De Magnete, which explained how astronomical observations could be used to determine the magnetic variation, was actually Wright's work.[4]/nGilbert had invented a dip-compass and compiled a table recording the dip of the needle below the horizon. Wright believed that this device would prove to be extremely useful in determining latitude and, with the help of Blundeville and Briggs, wrote a small pamphlet called The Making, Description and Use of the Two Instruments for Seamen to find out the Latitude ... First Invented by Dr. Gilbert. It was published in 1602 in Blundeville's book The Theoriques of the Seuen Planets.[37] That same year he authored The Description and Use of the Sph\u00e6re (not published till 1613), and in 1605 published a new edition of the widely used work The Safegarde of Saylers.[38][39]/nWright also developed a reputation as a surveyor on land. He prepared \"a plat of part of the waye whereby a newe River may be brought from Uxbridge to St. James, Whitehall, Westminster [,] the Strand, St Giles, Holbourne and London\",[40] However, according to a 1615 paper in Latin in the annals of Gonville and Caius College, he was prevented from bringing this plan to fruition \"by the tricks of others\".[23][41] Nonetheless, early in the first decade of the 17th century, he was appointed by Sir Hugh Myddelton as surveyor to the New River project, which successfully directed the course of a new man-made channel to bring clean water from Chadwell Spring at Ware, Hertfordshire,[23] to Islington, London. Although the distance in a straight line from Ware to London is only slightly more than 20 miles (32\u00a0km), the project required a high degree of surveying skill on Wright's part as it was necessary for the river to take a route of over 40\u00a0miles following the 100-foot (30\u00a0m) contour line on the west side of the Lea Valley. As the technology of the time did not extend to large pumps or pipes, the water flow had to depend on gravity through canals or aqueducts over an average fall of 5.5\u00a0inches a mile (approximately 8.7\u00a0centimetres per kilometre).[8][42]/nWork on the New River started in 1608 \u2013 the date of a monument at Chadwell Spring \u2013 but halted near Wormley, Hertfordshire, in 1610. The stoppage has been attributed to factors such as Myddelton facing difficulties in raising funds, and landowners along the route opposing the acquisition of their lands on the ground that the river would turn their meadows into \"bogs and quagmires\".[42] Although the landowners petitioned Parliament, they did not succeed in having the legislation authorising the project repealed prior to Parliament being dissolved in 1611; the work resumed later that year. The New River was officially opened on 29 September 1613 by the Lord Mayor of London, Sir John Swinnerton, at the Round Pond, New River Head, in Islington. It still supplies the capital with water today.[42]/nFor some time Wright had urged that a navigation lectureship be instituted for merchant seamen, and he persuaded Admiral Sir William Monson, who had been on Cumberland's Azores expedition of 1589, to encourage a stipend to be paid for this. At the beginning of the 17th century, Wright succeeded Thomas Hood as a mathematics lecturer under the patronage of the wealthy merchants Sir Thomas Smyth and Sir John Wolstenholme; the lectures were held in Smyth's house in Philpot Lane.[43] By 1612 or 1614 the East India Company had taken on sponsorship of these lectures for an annual fee of \u00a350[16][41] (about \u00a36,500 as of 2007).[44] Wright was also mathematics tutor to the son of James I, the heir apparent Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, from 1608 or 1609[16][39] until the latter's death at the age of 18 on 6 November 1612. Wright was described as \"a very poor man\" in the Prince's will and left the sum of \u00a330 8s (about \u00a34,300 in 2007).[4] To the Prince, who was greatly interested in the science of navigation,[45] Wright dedicated the second edition of Certaine Errors (1610) and the world map published therein. He also drew various maps for him, including a \"sea chart of the N.-W. Passage; a paradoxall sea-chart of the World from 30\u00b0 Latitude northwards; [and] a plat of the drowned groundes about Elye, Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, &c\".[39]/nWright was a skilled designer of mathematical instruments. According to the 1615 Caius annals, \"[h]e was excellent both in contrivance and execution, nor was he inferior to the most ingenious mechanic in the making of instruments, either of brass or any other matter\".[23] For Prince Henry, he made models of an astrolabe and a pantograph,[41] and created or arranged to be created out of wood a form of armillary sphere which replicated the motions of the celestial sphere, the circular motions of the sun and moon, and the places and possibilities of them eclipsing each other. The sphere was designed for a motion of 17,100\u00a0years, if the machine should last that long.[23] In 1613 Wright published The Description and Use of the Sph\u00e6re, which described the use of this device.[4] The sphere was lost during the English Civil War, but found in 1646 in the Tower of London by the mathematician and surveyor Sir Jonas Moore, who was later appointed Surveyor General of the Ordnance Office and became a patron and the principal driving force behind the establishment of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. Moore asked the King to let him have it, restored the instrument at his own expense and deposited it at his own house \"in the Tower\".[23][46]/nThe Caius annals also report that Wright \"had formed many other useful designs, but was hindered by death from bringing them to perfection\".[23] The 1610 edition of Certaine Errors contained descriptions of the \"sea-ring\", which consisted of a universal ring dial mounted over a magnetic compass that enabled mariners to determine readily the magnetic variation of the compass, the sun's altitude and the time of day in any place if the latitude was known;[47] the \"sea-quadrant\", for the taking of altitudes by a forward or backward observation; and a device for finding latitude when one was not on the meridian using the height of the pole star.[23]/nIn 1614 Wright published a small book called A Short Treatise of Dialling: Shewing, the Making of All Sorts of Sun-dials, but he was mainly preoccupied with John Napier's Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio (Description of the Wonderful Rule of Logarithms),[48] which introduced the idea of logarithms. Wright at once saw the value of logarithms as an aid to navigation, and lost no time in preparing a translation which he submitted to Napier himself. The preface to Wright's edition consists of a translation of the preface to the Descriptio, together with the addition of the following sentences written by Napier himself:/nBut now some of our countreymen in this Island well affected to these studies, and the more publique good, procured a most learned Mathematician to translate the same into our vulgar English tongue, who after he had finished it, sent the Coppy of it to me, to bee seene and considered on by myselfe. I having most willingly and gladly done the same, finde it to bee most exact and precisely conformable to my minde and the originall. Therefore it may please you who are inclined to these studies, to receive it from me and the Translator, with as much good will as we recommend it unto you.[49]/nWhile working on the translation, Wright died in late November 1615 and was buried on 2 December 1615 at St. Dionis Backchurch (now demolished) in the City of London.[50] The Caius annals noted that although he \"was rich in fame, and in the promises of the great, yet he died poor, to the scandal of an ungrateful age\".[23] Wright's translation of Napier, which incorporated tables that Wright had supplemented and further information by Henry Briggs, was completed by Wright's son Samuel and arranged to be printed by Briggs.[4] It appeared posthumously as A Description of the Admirable Table of Logarithmes in 1616, and in it Wright was lauded in verse as \"[t]hat famous, learned, Errors true Corrector, / England's great Pilot, Mariners Director\".[51]/nAccording to Parsons and Morris, the use of Wright's publications by later mathematicians is the \"greatest tribute to his life's work\".[41] Wright's work was relied on by Dutch astronomer and mathematician Willebrord Snellius, noted for the law of refraction now known as Snell's law, for his navigation treatise Tiphys Batavus (Batavian Tiphys, 1624);[52] and by Adriaan Metius, the geometer and astronomer from Holland, for Primum Mobile (1631).[53] Following Wright's proposals, Richard Norwood measured a degree on a great circle of the earth at 367,196 feet (111,921\u00a0m), publishing the information in 1637.[54] Wright was praised by Charles Saltonstall in The Navigator (1642)[55] and by John Collins in Navigation by the Mariners Plain Scale New Plain'd (1659),[56] Collins stating that Mercator's chart ought \"more properly to be called Wright's chart\".[41] The Caius annals contained the following epitaph: \"Of him it may truly be said, that he studied more to serve the public than himself\".[23]", "12660079": "Igor Kluv\u00e1nek (27 January 1931 \u2013 24 July 1993) was a Slovak-Australian mathematician./nIgor Kluv\u00e1nek obtained his first degree in electrical engineering from the Slovak Polytechnic University, Bratislava, in 1953. His first appointment was in the Department of Mathematics of the same institution. At the same time he worked for his C.Sc. degree obtained from the Slovak Academy of Sciences. In the early 60's he joined the Department of Mathematical Analysis of the University of Pavol Jozef \u0160af\u00e1rik in Ko\u0161ice. During 1967\u201368 he held a visiting position at The Flinders University of South Australia. The events of 1968 in Czechoslovakia made it impossible for him and his family to return to their homeland. The Flinders University of South Australia was able to create a chair in applied mathematics to which he was appointed in January 1969 and occupied until his resignation in 1986./nKluv\u00e1nek graduated in 1953 from the Slovak Polytechnic University with a degree in electrical engineering specialising in vacuum technology. That year, he married a former classmate from the gymnasium at Rimavsk\u00e1 Sobota. To support himself, he became a part-time tutor/lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, where he remained after completing his studies. At the same time, he worked for his C.Sc. degree obtained from the Slovak Academy of Sciences./nIn 1961, it became known at the polytechnic that he was a practising Catholic, which was deemed to be incompatible with the position of a socialist teacher. At that time, an attempt was made to minimise ideological confrontations in the interests of economic development. The affair blew over when he joined the Department of Mathematical Analysis of \u0160af\u00e1rikUniversity in his birthplace, Ko\u0161ice.[1]/nWith the approval of the Czechoslovak authorities, he arrived with his wife and five children in Adelaide in March 1967 to take up a two-year visiting position at the newly established Flinders University of South Australia. His wife and children departed Australia on 20 August 1968, in time for the children to start the new School year in September. While they were on their way, the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia took place. They landed in Z\u00fcrich, but all communications with Czechoslovakia were severed. They had no entry visa to any country, so the Swiss authorities put them on a plane back to Australia that day. Thus started his twenty-year sojourn in Australia./nIt seems that he would have returned with his family if he had not been sentenced in Czechoslovakia, in absentia, to a two-year prison sentence after his unexpected stay in Australia was deemed illegal by the Czechoslovak authorities. The enquiries conducted by his family in Czechoslovakia on his behalf, suggest that this penalty was only quashed in the late 1980s./nBesides his prison sentence, his wife had one year imprisonment imposed and all his property at home was forfeited, so they were effectively destitute and stateless. Fortunately, after his contract expired, Flinders created a chair in applied mathematics, which they offered to him. His wife died in 1981./nHe resigned his chair at Flinders in 1986 and after some unsuccessful attempts to study at seminaries in Sydney (1982) and Melbourne (1987\u201388) followed by temporary positions at the Centre for Mathematical Analysis in Canberra, he eventually left Australia in 1989 to settle in Bratislava. His children have remained in Australia. The gradual process of liberalisation in Czechoslovakia had facilitated his departure. The velvet revolution heralded his return home, and so his third life began. He became a member of the Slovak Academy of Sciences and remarried. His persecution by the old r\u00e9gime had conferred upon him the status of something of a celebrity. He declined an invitation to become minister of education. There was some disillusionment with the nature and pace of the institutional reform in Slovakia and he held several positions in quick succession. It was as he was about to leave his last position at the Slovak Technical University that he died./nHis five children stayed in Australia after his death, initially living in Adelaide and Melbourne./nIgor Kluv\u00e1nek made significant contributions to applied mathematics, functional analysis, operator theory and vector-valued integration. One needs only to consult his book Vector Measures and Control Systems written with Greg Knowles or examine the contents and historical notes of the monograph Vector Measures by J. Diestel and J.J. Uhl, Jr., to see that his penetrating studies into this area, of which he is one of the pioneers, pervade the subject. He has also made important contributions to various topics in harmonic analysis. For a sample of his influence in this area, see the excellent survey article \"Five short stories about the cardinal series\", Bull. Amer. Math. Soc., 12 (1985), 45\u201389, by J.R. Higgins which highlights the essential role played by just one of Kluv\u00e1nek's paper in the \"story\" of the sampling theorem. Kluv\u00e1nek introduced the concept of a closed vector measure. This notion was crucial for his investigations of the range of a vector measure and led to the extension to infinite dimensional spaces of the classical Liapunov convexity theorem, together with many consequences and applications. This work was in collaboration with G. Knowles and settled many of the major problems in this area. The notion of a closed vector measure stimulated much research, especially by W. Graves and his students at Chapel Hill, North Carolina. In intervening years it turned out that this notion is not only a basic tool in the study of algebras of operators generated by Boolean algebras of projections but lies at the very core of the major theorems in this area, even throwing a new perspective on the classical results in this field./nAs successful as the theory of integration with respect to countably additive vector measures has been in various branches of mathematics, such as mathematical physics, functional analysis and operator theory, for example, it is also known that there are fundamental problems which cannot be treated in this way. Nevertheless, these problems still seem to require for their solution \"some sort of integration process\" that Kluv\u00e1nek pursued to the end of his career. Some of his galaxy of ideas about integration appeared in his book Integration Structures./nAs well as his research publications, it should be mentioned that Igor Kluv\u00e1nek co-authored, with L. Mi\u0161\u00edk and M. \u0160vec, a two volume text book (in Slovak) on Differential and Integral calculus, Analytic geometry, Differential equations and Complex variables which has seen two editions and been widely used in Czechoslovakia. He also wrote lecture notes (in Slovak) with M. Kov\u00e1\u0159\u00edkov\u00e1 and Z. Kov\u00e1\u0159\u00edk on first year university analysis and a popular book (also in Slovak) with L. Bukovsk\u00fd on the pigeonhole principle. He spent a great deal of time during his appointment at Flinders developing course material for a basic foundation in mathematics. His presentation of the material changed over time as he developed new research ideas. He could not get it published in English but two volumes have been translated and published in Slovak\nwith the third volume to appear in 2008.[2] In addition, he wrote various articles of a pedagogic nature.", "63942001": "Caroline Jane (Carly) Klivans is an American mathematician specializing in algebraic combinatorics, including work on cell complexes associated with matroids and on chip-firing games.

As one of the restrictions of the Soviet system at that time, a doctoral thesis was not allowed to be defended in Latvia, so she defended hers in Minsk, receiving the title of Candidate of Sciences. This explains the fact that Taimi\u0146a's doctorate was formally issued by the Institute of Mathematics of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus. After Latvia regained independence in 1991, Taimi\u0146a received her higher doctoral degree (doktor nauk) in mathematics from the University of Latvia, where she taught for 20 years.[2]/nDaina Taimi\u0146a joined the Cornell Math Department in December 1996./nCombining her interests in mathematics and crocheting, she is one of 24 mathematicians and artists who make up the Mathemalchemy Team.[3]/nWhile attending a geometry workshop at Cornell University about teaching geometry for university professors in 1997, Taimi\u0146a was presented with a fragile paper model of a hyperbolic plane, made by the professor in charge of the workshop, David Henderson (designed by geometer William Thurston.[4]) It was made \u00about of thin, circular strips of paper taped together\u00bb.[5] She decided to make more durable models, and did so by crocheting them.[4] The first night after first seeing the paper model at the workshop she began experimenting with algorithms for a crocheting pattern, after visualising hyperbolic planes as exponential growth./nThe following fall, Taimi\u0146a was scheduled to teach a geometry class at Cornell. She was determined to find what she thought was the best possible way to teach her class. So while she, together with her family, spent the preceding summer at a tree farm in Pennsylvania, she also spent her days by the pool watching her two daughters learning how to swim whilst simultaneously making a classroom set of models of the hyperbolic plane. This was the first ever made from yarn and crocheting./nThe models made a significant difference to her students, according to themselves. They said they \"liked the tactile way of exploring hyperbolic geometry\" and that it helped them acquire experiences that helped them move on in said geometry.[6] This was what Taimina herself had been missing when first learning about hyperbolic planes and is also what has made her models so effective, as these models have later become the preferred way of explaining hyperbolic space within geometry.[7][8]/nIn a TedxRiga by Taimi\u0146a she tells the story of how the need for a visual, intuitive way of understanding hyperbolic planes spurred her toward inventing crocheted geometry models.

Originally creating purely mathematical models, Taimi\u0146a soon became popular as a fiber artist and public presenter for general audiences of ages five and up. In June 2005, her work was first shown as art in an exhibition \"Not The Knitting You Know\" at Eleven Eleven Sculpture Space, an art gallery in Washington, D.C.[11]  Since then she has participated regularly in various shows in galleries in US, UK, Latvia, Italy, Belgium, Ireland, Germany.

He was one of the eponymous co-discoverers of the Sprague\u2013Grundy function and its application to the analysis of a wide class of combinatorial games.[1]/nGrundy received his secondary education from  Malvern College, to which he had obtained a Major Scholarship in 1931, and from which he graduated in 1935.  While there, he demonstrated his aptitude for mathematics by winning three prizes in that subject.  After leaving school he entered Clare College, Cambridge, on a Foundation Scholarship, where he read for the Mathematical Tripos from 1936 to 1939, earning first class honours in Part II and a distinction in Part III./nThe work for which he is best known appeared in his first paper, Mathematics and Games, first published in the Cambridge University Mathematical Society's magazine, Eureka in 1939,[2] and reprinted by the same magazine in 1964.[3]  The main results of this paper were discovered independently by Grundy and by Roland Sprague, and had already been published by the latter in 1935.[4]  The key idea is that of a function that assigns a non-negative integer to each position of a class of combinatorial games, now called impartial games, and which greatly assists in the identification of winning and losing positions, and of the winning moves from the former.  The number assigned to a position by this function is called its Grundy value (or Grundy number), and the function itself is called the Sprague\u2013Grundy function, in honour of its co-discoverers.[5]   The procedures developed by Sprague and Grundy for using their function to analyse impartial games are collectively called Sprague\u2013Grundy theory, and at least two different  theorems concerning these procedures have been called Sprague\u2013Grundy theorems.[6] The maximum number of colors used by a greedy coloring algorithm is called the Grundy number, also after this work on games, as its definition has some formal similarities with the Sprague\u2013Grundy theory.[7]/nIn 1939 Grundy began research in algebraic geometry as a research student at the University of Cambridge, eventually specialising in the theory of ideals.  In 1941 he won a Smith's Prize for an essay entitled On the theory of R-modules, and his first research paper in the area, A generalisation of additive ideal theory, was published in the following year.[8]  In 1943 he was appointed to an assistant lectureship at the University College of Hull, which he left in 1944.  He was awarded a Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge in 1945./nShortly after the end of World War II, Grundy moved away from the field of algebra to take up work in statistics.   In 1947 he began formal training in the latter discipline at the Rothamsted Experimental Station under a Ministry of Agriculture scholarship, graduating in 1949, when he then joined the permanent staff of the former organisation as an Experimental Officer.   In 1951 he was promoted to Senior Experimental Officer.  During his time at Rothamsted he performed most of his published statistical research, which included investigations of problems in the design and analysis of experiments, sampling, composition of animal populations, and fitting truncated distributions./nFrom 1954 to 1958 Grundy worked as a statistician at the National Institute for Educational Research.   During this period, he collaborated with Michael Healy and D.H. Rees to extend Frank Yates's work on cost\u2013benefit analysis of experimentation.   The results of this collaboration were reported in an influential paper, Economic choice of the amount of experimentation, published in series B of the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society in 1956.[9]  In 1958 Grundy moved to a position in the Biometry Unit at Oxford.  However, he retired from this position after only one term, due to ill health./nEarly in 1959 Grundy married Hilary Taylor, a former colleague from the National Institute of Educational Research.

Sylow theorems and p-groups, known as Sylow subgroups, are fundamental in finite groups.[2] By profession, Sylow was a teacher at the Frederiksborg Latin School for 40 years from 1858 to 1898, and then a professor at the University of Oslo for 20 years from 1898 to 1918.[1] Despite the isolation in Frederiksborg, Sylow was an active member of the mathematical world. He wrote a total of approximately 25 mathematical and biographical works, corresponded with many of the leading mathematicians of the time, and was an able co-editor of Acta Mathematica from the journal's start in 1882.[1] He was also elected into the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters in 1868, a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences in G\u00f6ttingen and the University of Copenhagen awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1894.[1][2]/nLudvig Sylow was born in Kristiania (now Oslo) on 12 December 1832 to later minister and customs treasurer Thomas Edvard von Westen Sylow (1792\u20131875) and Magdalene Cecilie Cathrine Mejdell (1806\u201398).[1][2] His father had been an officer and a captain in the cavalry, and later he served as the head of the Ministry of the Army between 1848 and 1854.[1][2]/nInitially, his father was aware of his son's talent in Mathematics, so he encouraged him to work independently. From home, Sylow learned a sense of duty and hard work, but was also taught to be modest and although this was done with the best of intentions, it would become an obstacle for him later in life since it meant that he was happy to spend many years in a more lowly position than he should have had.[1][2]/nSylow attended Christiania Cathedral School, graduating in 1850 after taking the examen artium.[1] He then became a student at the University of Oslo where he began his studies of natural sciences.[2] In 1853, the University of Oslo awarded him the Crown Prince's gold medal (Kronprinsens gullmedalje) for a Mathematics subject about Gnomonics.[3] In 1856 he took the high school mathematics teacher's examination (Realkankidat, Norwish to Real candidate) with excellent grades.[1][2][4]/nHe completed his graduation in 1856, but since no university post was available, he taught for two years at Hartvig Nissen School, an independent girls' school in the Uranienborg district of Christiania, which had been founded by Hartvig Nissen and Ole Jacob Broch.[2] His years there came during Broch's most energetic university period, and it was Broch who introduced Sylow to Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi's fundamental work on elliptic functions, among other things.[citation needed]/nIn 1858, Sylow moved to the town of Fredrikshald (now called Halden) in Ostfold county, where he taught at Frederiksborg Latin School as the Head Teacher in Mathematics and Science, a modest position that he held for a whole 40 years, from 1858 to 1898.[1][2][3] Although Sylow would have made an outstanding university lecturer, he did not make a particularly good school teacher, since he was interested in the advanced areas of mathematics and had thus little enthusiasm for teaching at lower levels.[2] Moreover, he also found it difficult to keep discipline in his classroom, so the fact that his career was largely in schools rather than universities was a poor use of his talents on two scores: Universities were the poorer for not having Sylow as a lecturer, while schools were poorer for having him as a teacher.[2]/nDuring his studies, Sylow had become interested in the work of Niels Henrik Abel, and especially in an unfinished work on equation theory that had been left behind.[1] However, it was only at Hartvig Nissen School (1856\u201358) that he began to research that work more deeply, in part thanks to Ole Jacob Broch, who was the school's pure mathematics teacher at the time.[2] It was Broch who gave the young teacher Sylow much encouragement to continue his advanced mathematical researches.[2] Although at first Sylow found reading Abel's papers a difficult task, he managed to struggle through them and soon found that Abel had achieved a far deeper understanding of the theory of equations than what he had managed to write in his published papers.[1][2]/nSome of Sylow's first attempts to publish some of Abel's unpublished results that he had found in his papers proved to be unsuccessful. For instance, he sent one of these papers to Crelle's Journal in Berlin, but the editor there, Leopold Kronecker, had already published these results having discovered them himself, and had no wish to have a paper in print which showed that Abel had proved them long before he had.[1][2] Kronecker did not accept that Abel had preceded him, and therefore, he rejected Sylow's paper, but even though the article was rejected, posterity has proved Sylow right.[1][2] Sylow showcased his discoveries at a Scandinavian meeting of naturalists in 1860 in Copenhagen, where he presented a solid interpretation of a strange equation-theoretic treatise by Abel, edited only in fragments.[1]/nIn 1861 Sylow obtained a scholarship for studies in Paris and Berlin.[1][2] In Paris he attended lectures by Michel Chasles on the theory of conics, by Joseph Liouville on rational mechanics and by Jean-Marie Duhamel on the theory of limits. He also used this scholarship to make himself acquainted with newer works, particularly in the theory of equations.[2] In Berlin, Sylow had useful discussions with Kronecker, but was unable to attend courses by Karl Weierstrass who was ill at the time, and since there were no other courses being given in Berlin that interested him, Sylow instead decided to work in the library, studying number theory and the theory of equations.[citation needed]/nIn the following year, in 1862, Sylow lectured at the University of Christiania as a substitute for Professor Ole Jacob Broch, who had been elected to serve in the Storting, the Norwegian parliament.[1][2] In his lectures Sylow explained Abel's and Galois's work on algebraic equations, and in doing so he became one of the first in Europe to lecture on \u00c9variste Galois's works.[2] Among his listeners was the young Sophus Lie, who would later create a strange new science on the basis of these ideas, the theory of continuous symmetry.[1][2]/nLie once commented that Sylow deserved a university position because of his \"broad knowledge, his sharp powers of criticism, and his outstanding mathematical work\".[2] And for a time, it seemed that the university would finally bet on him since he had received a scholarship trip to Berlin and Paris in 1861, and then spent a year doing the mathematical lectures at the Christiania University during Broch's absence abroad, during which he also began to treat and lecture Galois' group theory.[1][2] But instead, his career simply stopped. When Broch again became an MP in the Storting from 1865 to 1868, he was keen to have Sylow take over the teaching of his university during this time, but the school in Fredrikshald in which Saylow was a teacher refused to give him leave to teach at the Christiania university, and they received support from the ministry.[2] Broch left his chair as professor of pure mathematics in 1869, thus leaving a vacancy that Sylow was well qualified to have filled, and in fact, everyone expected Sylow to take over his professorship in pure mathematics. However, the University of Christiania did not rate pure mathematics very highly at that time, preferring more practical, useful, down-to-earth mathematics with more applicable topics, and Sylow was too theoretical in his approach so he was not appointed.[2] The professor of applied mathematics, Carl Anton Bjerknes, was instead pressured to move into Broch's position, so that Cato Guldberg could take over the applied mathematics.[1][2]/nSylow was known to mathematicians of every civilized country on account of a well-known theorem that bears his name. Just as every educated person knows the Pythagorean theorem so does every mathematician speak of Abel's theorem and Sylow's theorem./nFerdinand Georg Frobenius[2]/nSince few contemporary mathematicians were as deeply familiar with Abel's work as Sylow was, Professor Carl Anton Bjerknes advised him to study \u00c9variste Galois's works about group theory, in which Abel had also contributed a lot.[1] However, it was only when Sylow began to lecture about Abel's and Galois's work on algebraic equations in 1862, that he began to further develop their innovative works, especially those related to group theory, and in fact, by the end of that year, Sylow had already proved foundational results in group theory, which are now known as Sylow theorems and p-groups, known as Sylow subgroups, which are now basic terms in group theory.[1] He was thus one of the first mathematicians to penetrate Galois' group theory. However, it was not until 1872, 10 years later, that Sylow published his most important discoveries in group theory in Alfred Clebsch's journal (Math. Ann.), in a small treatise of ten pages called Theor\u00e9mes sur les groupes de substitutions, in which Sylow generalizes his discoveries and proves what is perhaps the most profound result in the theory of finite groups.[1][2] Almost all work on finite groups uses Sylow's theorems.[2]/nWhen the famous French mathematician Camille Jordan published the standard work Th\u00e9orie des Substitutions in 1870, Sylow was familiar with most of what was written there and more.[2] When Jordan visited Christiania in 1872, Sophus Lie took him on an excursion to Frognerseteren with Sylow, who described to him what is now called \"Sylow's theorem\", which he had known since 1862.[1][2] Jordan was astonished and somewhat skeptical, but shortly afterwards, he wrote enthusiastically from Sweden, and he helped Sylow to get that 10-page thesis published that same year in 1872. That thesis made Sylow a well-known European mathematician.[2]/nIn 1868 he was elected into the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters (Det Norske Widenskaps-Akademi).[1] From 1870 to 1871, Sylow exchanged nine letters with Julius Petersen who, at this time, was working on his doctoral dissertation. Petersen sought Sylow's advice about the main theorem of his dissertation and all of these letters deal are about this subject. The two mathematicians exchanged another sixteen letters a few years later, in 1876 and 1877.[2]/nHowever, Sylow's most well-known written work rests on his 10-page thesis published in 1872 called Th\u00e9or\u00e8mes sur les groupes de substitutions (Theorems on substitution groups), which was published in Mathematische Annalen Volume 5 (pages 584 to 594).[2] This paper has the three Sylow theorems, which prove foundational results in group theory. Sylow had already proved this in 1862, but only published it in 1872, and by then, Augustin-Louis Cauchy had already proved that a group whose order is divisible by a prime.[2] Winfried Scharlau described how Sylow was led to his discovery by his study of Galois' work, in particular of Galois' criterion for the solvability of equations of prime degree. The paper explains how Sylow used methods from Galois theory in his proofs.[2]/nBesides the thesis of 1872, Sylow's main work was the new edition of Abel's collected writings which he procured in association with former student Sophus Lie on a public basis, when in 1873, Sylow and Lie were commissioned to provide a new edition of Niels Henrik Abel's collected works, paid for by the state.[1][2] The preparations for the publication of this work took eight years, from 1873 to 1881, during which he had only partial leave from his teaching work, being on leave from school for four years.[1][2] Sylow and Lie prepared an edition of Abel's complete work published under the title Oeuvres compl\u00e8te de Niels Henrik Abel (French for: Complete Works of Niels Henrik Abel).[2] The motivation for this had come from the Norwegian Academy of Science who applied to the Norwegian Parliament for funding for the project, which was quickly granted. This funding allowed Sylow to take leave from his school in Fredrikshald for four years in order to devote himself to the project.[2] Sylow wanted as much as possible of Abel's early works to come out, not just his great treatises with their exemplary stringency, and thus, he used this opportunity to dig up more of his early works, and in fact, there was much more additional Abel material published in the Sylow/Lie edition which appeared on 9 December 1881, than what Bjerknes used on his Abel biography of 1880.[2]/nIn 1902, Sylow, in collaboration with Elling Holst, published Abel's correspondence. Further Abel documents had been discovered after the Sylow/Lie book came out in 1881 and, at the Third Scandinavian Congress of Mathematicians, which was held in Kristiania in 1913, Sylow discussed this new material.[2] In addition to the Sylow theorems and the Abel material, Sylow also published a few papers on elliptic functions, particularly on complex multiplication, as well as papers on group theory.[2]/nIn 1883 Sylow became an editor of Acta Mathematica, was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences of G\u00f6ttingen and, in 1894, the University of Copenhagen awarded him an honorary doctorate.[2]/nA couple of times in his youth, Sylow briefly had the prospect of becoming a lecturer at a university, where he had absolutely belonged from the first moment, but the disfavor of the times left him unnoticed in his native land despite his name being already widely known outside Norway.[1] As a result, Sylow spent a whole 40 years, from 1858 to 1898, holding the modest position of head teacher in mathematics and science at the Frederiksborg Latin School, a long reign that came to an end when Sylow was finally appointed as a professor of mathematics at the University of Oslo in 1898,[3] and despite already being 65 when he obtained a university post, he was still able to hold this position for 20 years, until 1918, when he died at the age of 85.[2] His rare talent in mathematics revealed itself immediately upon his arrival at the university, to which he brought knowledge far beyond elementary mathematics.[3] At first, he was paid a headmaster's salary, which was approximately half the salary of a university professor, but he later received salary increases.[2]/nAt the centenary of Abel's birth in 1902, Sylow gave the welcoming address at a conference to mark the centenary of his birth,[2] giving a characterization of his great predecessor, who was hailed by all the famous mathematicians of the various countries who had met together as the one who will stand as the permanent.[1]/nSylow never married, but was a warm person with a nice sense of humour.[2] He was an avid lover of being out of doors and often spent summer vacations in the mountains, usually in Kongsvoll, where he studied plants. Kongsvoll is a mountain station providing food and shelter on the route between Oslo and Trondheim, erected when the route was used by pilgrims visiting the shrine of St Olav in Trondheim.[2]/nSylow died on 7 September 1918, at the age of 85, in Christiania, Norway.[1]", "50638226": "Mellen Woodman Haskell (March 17, 1863 \u2013 January 15, 1948) was an American mathematician, specializing in geometry, group theory, and applications of group theory to geometry.[1]/nAfter secondary education at Roxbury Latin School, he received in 1883 his bachelor's degree and in 1885 his M.A. and a Parker Traveling Fellowship from Harvard University.

Although many concerned about his health repeatedly suggested he go abroad to recuperate, he politely refused, insisting on teaching and continuing his research work./nIn 1956, Dr. Hsu was made Director of the first research institute for probability and statistics to be established in China. But his health continued to worsen, forcing him to work at home, which included giving lectures at his home to graduate students and young teachers using a blackboard hanging on a wall of his room./nA month before his death in 1970 his manuscript on the relationship between experimental design and algebraic coding theory was completed, with such being his final legacy. Hsu died in his home on the campus of Peking University on December 18, 1970, from chronic tuberculosis. Found beside his bed the day after his death were piles of manuscripts that \"serve as a testimony to the super-human fortitude with which he exerted himself for a period of more than 20 years...\" In total, he had published more than 40 papers./nThere was a memorial meeting and Pao-Lu Hsu Award[2] in his honor.[3][4] Hsu is a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS) and Academician of the Academy of Science of China. Memorial meetings were held in 1980, 1990, 2000 & 2010 at Peking University./nProfessor Hsu's main research areas were mathematical statistics and probability theory. He was an expert in operating matrix, manipulating characteristic functions and integral transformation. Hsu was a world-class statistician and is considered to be the founder of probability and statistics in China./nHe influenced many students such as Theodore Wilbur Anderson, Erich Leo Lehmann, and Chung Kai-lai./nIn 1938, Hsu's first two statistical papers were published, concerning the Behrens\u2013Fisher problem[5] and an optimal estimate of the variance \u03c32 in Gauss-Markov processes.[6] In another important paper published around this time, Hsu established the first optimal property for hypotheses in the likelihood-ratio test for univariate linear models, which was also the first nonlocal optimal property for any hypothesis specifying the value of more than one parameter.[7] From 1938 to 1945, Hsu published several papers at the forefront of the development of the theory of multivariate analysis. During this time, he obtained several exact or asymptotic estimates of important statistical distributions in the field of multivariate analysis.[8][9]/nHsu was an expert in manipulating characteristic functions, which he used as a tool in obtaining the distributions of certain random variables and in determining the limiting distribution of series of random variables (as in the Hsu\u2013Robbins\u2013Erd\u0151s theorem for which he is partially named).[10][11]/nAnother example of Hsu' work in this field, published around 1940, concerned a solution to the most general form of the Central Limit Theorem, which drew the attention of many famed mathematicians, such as Paul L\u00e9vy, William Feller, Andrey Kolmogorov, and Boris Gnedenko. Hsu made contributions to this problem in his paper, \"A general weak limit theorem for independent distributions,\",[12] a manuscript mailed to Kai Lai Chung in 1947. In this paper, Hsu independently obtained a necessary and sufficient condition under which the row sums of a triangular matrix of infinitesimal random variables, independent in each row, will converge in distribution to a given infinitely divisible distribution. Despite the fact that Gnedenko obtained the same result in 1944, Hsu's method is direct and has its own trait.[13][14]", "1158561": "Acharya Virasena (792-853 CE),[1] also known as Veerasena, was a Digambara monk and belonged to the lineage of Acharya Kundakunda.[2] He  was an Indian mathematician and Jain philosopher and scholar.

Twenty kilometers away, they were joined by Kiesenhofer. In the descent of the pass of Murs, the groups were seven minutes and twenty-five seconds ahead. After Blavac, Anna Plichta went off alone and she had a lead of a minute thirty at the foot of Mont Ventoux. On the ascent, Kiesenhofer joined her.

He also wrote two astronomical works in the line of Aryabhata's school: the Mah\u0101bh\u0101skar\u012bya (\"Great Book of Bh\u0101skara\") and the Laghubh\u0101skar\u012bya (\"Small Book of Bh\u0101skara\").[3][4]/nOn 7 June 1979, the Indian Space Research Organisation launched the Bh\u0101skara I satellite, named in honour of the mathematician.[5]/nLittle is known about Bh\u0101skara's life, except for what can be deduced from his writings. He was born in India in the 7th century, and was probably an astronomer.[6] Bh\u0101skara I received his astronomical education from his father./nThere are references to places in India in Bh\u0101skara's writings, such as Vallabhi (the capital of the Maitraka dynasty in the 7th century) and Sivarajapura, both of which are in the Saurastra region of the present-day state of Gujarat in India. Also mentioned are Bharuch in southern Gujarat, and Thanesar in the eastern Punjab, which was ruled by Harsha. Therefore, a reasonable guess would be that Bh\u0101skara was born in Saurastra and later moved to A\u015bmaka.[1][2]/nBh\u0101skara I is considered the most important scholar of Aryabhata's astronomical school. He and Brahmagupta are two of the most renowned Indian mathematicians; both made considerable contributions to the study of fractions./nThe most important mathematical contribution of Bh\u0101skara I concerns the representation of numbers in a positional numeral system. The first positional representations had been known to Indian astronomers approximately 500 years before Bh\u0101skara's work. However, these numbers were written not in figures, but in words or allegories and were organized in verses. For instance, the number 1 was given as moon, since it exists only once; the number 2 was represented by wings, twins, or eyes since they always occur in pairs; the number 5 was given by the (5) senses. Similar to our current decimal system, these words were aligned such that each number assigns the factor of the power of ten corresponding to its position, only in reverse order: the higher powers were right from the lower ones./nBh\u0101skara's numeral system was truly positional, in contrast to word representations, where the same word could represent multiple values (such as 40 or 400).[7] He often explained a number given in his numeral system by stating ankair api (\"in figures this reads\"), and then repeating it written with the first nine Brahmi numerals, using a small circle for the zero. Contrary to the word system, however, his numerals were written in descending values from left to right, exactly as we do it today. Therefore, since at least 629, the decimal system was definitely known to the Indian scientists. Presumably, Bh\u0101skara did not invent it, but he was the first to openly use the Brahmi numerals in a scientific contribution in Sanskrit./nBh\u0101skara I wrote three astronomical contributions. In 629, he annotated the \u0100ryabha\u1e6d\u012bya, an astronomical treatise by Aryabhata written in verses. Bh\u0101skara's comments referred exactly to the 33 verses dealing with mathematics, in which he considered variable equations and trigonometric formulae. In general, he emphasized proving mathematical rules instead of simply relying on tradition or expediency.[3]/nHis work Mah\u0101bh\u0101skar\u012bya is divided into eight chapters about mathematical astronomy. In chapter 7, he gives a remarkable approximation formula for sin x:/nwhich he assigns to Aryabhata. It reveals a relative error of less than 1.9% (the greatest deviation \n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n5\n\u03c0\n\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\u2248\n1.859\n%\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {16}{5\\pi }}-1\\approx 1.859\\%}\n\n at \n\n\n\nx\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x=0}\n\n). Additionally, he gives relations between sine and cosine, as well as relations between the sine of an angle less than 90\u00b0 and the sines of angles 90\u00b0\u2013180\u00b0, 180\u00b0\u2013270\u00b0, and greater than 270\u00b0./nBh\u0101skara already dealt with the assertion that if \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n is a prime number, then \n\n\n\n1\n+\n(\np\n\u2212\n1\n)\n!\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1+(p-1)!}\n\n is divisible by \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n.[citation needed] This was later proved by Al-Haitham, mentioned by Fibonacci, and is now known as Wilson's theorem./nMoreover, Bh\u0101skara stated theorems about the solutions to equations now known as Pell's equations. For instance, he posed the problem: \"Tell me, O mathematician, what is that square which multiplied by 8 becomes \u2013 together with unity \u2013 a square?\" In modern notation, he asked for the solutions of the Pell equation \n\n\n\n8\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n+\n1\n=\n\ny\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 8x^{2}+1=y^{2}}\n\n. This equation has the simple solution x = 1, y = 3, or shortly (x,y) = (1,3), from which further solutions can be constructed, such as (x,y) = (6,17)./nBh\u0101skara clearly believed that \u03c0 was irrational. In support of Aryabhata's approximation of \u03c0, he criticized its approximation to \n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {10}}}\n\n, a practice common among Jain mathematicians.[3][2]/nHe was the first mathematician to openly discuss quadrilaterals with four unequal, nonparallel sides.[8]/nThe Mah\u0101bh\u0101skar\u012bya consists of eight chapters dealing with mathematical astronomy. The book deals with topics such as the longitudes of the planets, the conjunctions among the planets and stars, the phases of the moon, solar and lunar eclipses, and the rising and setting of the planets.[3]/nParts of Mah\u0101bh\u0101skar\u012bya were later translated into Arabic./n(From Keller (2006a, p.\u00a0xiii))", "36941284": "Gaston Albert Gohierre de Longchamps (1 March 1842 \u2013 9 July 1906) was a French mathematician.[1]/nGohierre de Longchamps was born on 1 March 1842 in Alen\u00e7on.

He has been called \"Bermuda\u2019s outstanding genius of the seventeenth century\".[1]/nBorn about 1590, he was in 1616 sent out by the Somers Isles Company to survey the islands of Bermuda (also known as the Somers Isles), then newly settled. He was later accused of collusion with the governor, and that, after assigning the shares to all the settlers, eight shares of the best land remained over, for the personal advantage of himself and the governor. His map was published in London in 1622.[2]/nIn 1623, Norwood patented lands in Virginia, but it does not appear that he ever went there. He is said to have resided at that date in the Bermudas. He may have made several visits to the islands, but according to his own statements he was, for some years before 1630 and after, up to 1640, resident in London, near Tower Hill, as a teacher of mathematics. He is also credited with founding Bermuda's oldest school, Warwick Academy, in 1662.[3]/nBetween June 1633 and June 1635 he personally measured, partly by chain and partly by pacing, the distance between London and York, making corrections for all the windings of the way, as well as for the ascents and descents. He also, from observations of the sun's altitude, computed the difference of latitude of the two places, and so calculated the length of a degree of the meridian (arc measurement). His result was some 600 yards too great; but it was the nearest approximation that had then been made in England.[2]\nIsaac Newton noted Norwood's work in his Principia Mathematica.[4]/nDuring the English Civil War he resided in Bermuda, where he had a government grant as schoolmaster. A Somers Isles Company magazine ship, which had left England before the King's 30 January 1649 execution, arrived at Bermuda in March, 1649, bearing news of the King's impending trial. It also bore instructions from the Company stripping the moderate Royalist Captain Thomas Turner of the office of Governor (which had been filled by a succession of Bermudian settlers since the 1630s, in contrast to the company's earlier practice of dispatching governors to the colony) and ordering that the colony be governed by a triumvirate composed of the moderate Richard Norwood, Captain Leacraft (also spelt Leicroft), and Mr. Wilkinson. However, Leacraft had died before the instructions arrived, Wilkinson was a strong Independent, obnoxious to the dominant Church faction in the Council and the House of Assembly, and was not permitted by them to exercise his commission, and Norwood would not accept his own commission without Wilkinson./nOn the 18 December 1649, the Earl of Pembroke, Colonel Purefoy, Sir W. Constable, the Earl of Denbigh, Lord Whitelocke, Colonel Wanton, and Mr. Holland were appointed by the Council of State, with any three or more of them to be a committee with authority to examine the business of Bermuda.

Although the Country (the Royalist party) made charges against Forster and Captain Jennings on learning of this, demanding their charges be answered before the commission read, and many members of the Council denied to take notice of it because the l'tre was not directed to them with the Gour as here to fore, but eventually it was agreed to read it, and Forster was accepted as Governor./nThe following day, Trimingham, Mr. Miller, Captain Jennings, and Mr. Morgan accepted the oaths of Councillors. Richard Norwood, Mr. Berkeley, and Mr. Wainwright refused. Mr. Deuitt would not accept because the company deserted him./nDespite accepting the instructions from London on the matter of the new appointments, the Government of Bermuda remained Royalist. With the Royalists in control of the military, the company-appointed governor was compelled to resign and John Trimingham elected to replace him. The Independent s who supported Parliament were forced into exile, settling the Bahamas as the Eleutheran Adventurers./nThe Act prohibiting trade with Bermuda and the other colonies considered in rebellion was passed on 3 Oct, 1650./nAdmiral Sir George Ayscue, in command of the task force sent in 1651 by Parliament to capture the Royalist colonies, received additional instructions from Whitehall (dated 13 February 1651) addressed to him and the other Commissioners, instructing \"aswell to take Care for the reducemt of Bermuda's Virginia & Antego, as of the Island of Barbada's\"; \"In the case that (through the blessing of God upon yor endeavors) you shall be able to recover the Island of Barbada's unto its due subjection to this Comonwealth or after you have used your utmost dilligence to effect the same.

The Fourier transform and Fourier's law of conduction are also named in his honour. Fourier is also generally credited with the discovery of the greenhouse effect.[2]/nFourier was born in Auxerre (now in the Yonne d\u00e9partement of France), the son of a tailor. He was orphaned at the age of nine. Fourier was recommended to the Bishop of Auxerre and, through this introduction, he was educated by the Benedictine Order of the Convent of St. Mark. The commissions in the scientific corps of the army were reserved for those of good birth, and being thus ineligible, he accepted a military lectureship on mathematics. He took a prominent part in his own district in promoting the French Revolution, serving on the local Revolutionary Committee. He was imprisoned briefly during the Terror but, in 1795, was appointed to the \u00c9cole Normale and subsequently succeeded Joseph-Louis Lagrange at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique./nFourier accompanied Napoleon Bonaparte on his Egyptian expedition in 1798, as scientific adviser, and was appointed secretary of the Institut d'\u00c9gypte. Cut off from France by the British fleet, he organized the workshops on which the French army had to rely for their munitions of war. He also contributed several mathematical papers to the Egyptian Institute (also called the Cairo Institute) which Napoleon founded at Cairo, with a view of weakening British influence in the East. After the British victories and the capitulation of the French under General Menou in 1801, Fourier returned to France./nIn 1801,[4] Napoleon appointed Fourier Prefect (Governor) of the Department of Is\u00e8re in Grenoble, where he oversaw road construction and other projects. However, Fourier had previously returned home from the Napoleon expedition to Egypt to resume his academic post as professor at \u00c9cole Polytechnique when Napoleon decided otherwise in his remark/n... the Prefect of the Department of Is\u00e8re having recently died, I would like to express my confidence in citizen Fourier by appointing him to this place.[4]/nHence being faithful to Napoleon, he took the office of Prefect.[4] It was while at Grenoble that he began to experiment on the propagation of heat. He presented his paper On the Propagation of Heat in Solid Bodies to the Paris Institute on 21 December 1807. He also contributed to the monumental Description de l'\u00c9gypte.[5]/nIn 1822, Fourier succeeded Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre as Permanent Secretary of the French Academy of Sciences. In 1830, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences./nFourier never married.[6]/nIn 1830, his diminished health began to take its toll:/nFourier had already experienced, in Egypt and Grenoble, some attacks of aneurysm of the heart. At Paris, it was impossible to be mistaken with respect to the primary cause of the frequent suffocations which he experienced. A fall, however, which he sustained on the 4th of May 1830, while descending a flight of stairs, aggravated the malady to an extent beyond what could have been ever feared.[7]/nShortly after this event, he died in his bed on 16 May 1830./nFourier was buried in the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, a tomb decorated with an Egyptian motif to reflect his position as secretary of the Cairo Institute, and his collation of Description de l'\u00c9gypte. His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower./nA bronze statue was erected in Auxerre in 1849, but it was melted down for armaments during World War II.[a] Joseph Fourier University in Grenoble was named after him./nIn 1822, Fourier published his work on heat flow in Th\u00e9orie analytique de la chaleur (The Analytical Theory of Heat),[8]  in which he based his reasoning on Newton's law of cooling, namely, that the flow of heat between two adjacent molecules is proportional to the extremely small difference of their temperatures. This book was translated,[9] with editorial 'corrections',[10] into English 56 years later by Freeman (1878).[11] The book was also edited, with many editorial corrections, by Darboux and republished in French in 1888.[10]/nThere were three important contributions in this work, one purely mathematical, two essentially physical. In mathematics, Fourier claimed that any function of a variable, whether continuous or discontinuous, can be expanded in a series of sines of multiples of the variable. Though this result is not correct without additional conditions, Fourier's observation that some discontinuous functions are the sum of infinite series was a breakthrough. The question of determining when a Fourier series converges has been fundamental for centuries. Joseph-Louis Lagrange had given particular cases of this (false) theorem, and had implied that the method was general, but he had not pursued the subject. Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet  was the first to give a satisfactory demonstration of it with some restrictive conditions. This work provides the foundation for what is today known as the Fourier transform./nOne important physical contribution in the book was the concept of dimensional homogeneity in equations; i.e. an equation can be formally correct only if the dimensions match on either side of the equality; Fourier made important contributions to dimensional analysis.[12] The other physical contribution was Fourier's proposal of his partial differential equation for conductive diffusion of heat. This equation is now taught to every student of mathematical physics./nFourier left an unfinished work on determining and locating real roots of polynomials, which was edited by Claude-Louis Navier and published in 1831. This work contains much original matter\u2014in particular, Fourier's theorem on polynomial real roots, published in 1820. Fourier's theorem on real roots of polynomials states that a polynomial with real coefficients has a real root between any two consecutive zeros of its derivative.[13][14] Fran\u00e7ois Budan, in 1807 and 1811, had published independently his theorem (also known by the name of Fourier), which is very close to Fourier's theorem (each theorem is a corollary of the other). Fourier's proof[13] is the one that was usually given, during 19th century, in textbooks on the theory of equations.[b] A complete solution of the problem was given in 1829 by Jacques Charles Fran\u00e7ois Sturm.[15]/nIn the 1820s, Fourier calculated that an object the size of the Earth, and at its distance from the Sun, should be considerably colder than the planet actually is if warmed by only  the effects of incoming solar radiation. He examined various possible sources of the additional observed heat in articles published in 1824[16] and 1827.[17] However, in the end, because of the large 33-degree difference between his calculations and observations, Fourier mistakenly believed that there is a significant contribution of radiation from interstellar space. Still, Fourier's consideration of the possibility that the Earth's atmosphere might act as an insulator of some kind is widely recognized as the first proposal of what is now known as the greenhouse effect,[18] although Fourier never called it that.[19][20]/nIn his articles, Fourier referred to an experiment by de Saussure, who lined a vase with blackened cork. Into the cork, he inserted several panes of transparent glass, separated by intervals of air. Midday sunlight was allowed to enter at the top of the vase through the glass panes. The temperature became more elevated in the more interior compartments of this device. Fourier concluded that gases in the atmosphere could form a stable barrier like the glass panes.[17] This conclusion may have contributed to the later use of the metaphor of the \"greenhouse effect\" to refer to the processes that determine atmospheric temperatures.[21] Fourier noted that the actual mechanisms that determine the temperatures of the atmosphere included convection, which was not present in de Saussure's experimental device.", "3681770": "Desmond MacHale (born 28 January 1946) is Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at University College Cork, Ireland.[1][2] He is an author and speaker on several subjects, including George Boole, lateral thinking puzzles, and humour.

In order to achieve his goal, he married Anna Fortunato Brivio of the Brivius de Brokles family in 1717. Her mother's death provided her the excuse to retire from public life. She took over the management of the household. She was one of 21 children.[11] Her family was recognized as one of the wealthiest in Milan.[citation needed]/nMaria was recognized early on as a child prodigy; she could speak both Italian and French at five years of age. By her eleventh birthday, she had also learned Greek, Hebrew, Spanish, German, and Latin, and was referred to as the \"Seven-Tongued Orator\".[12]/nAgnesi suffered a mysterious illness at the age of twelve that was attributed to her excessive studying and reading, so she was prescribed vigorous dancing and horseback riding. This treatment did not work; she began to experience extreme convulsions, after which she was encouraged to pursue moderation. By age fourteen, she was studying ballistics and geometry.[12] When she was fifteen, her father began to regularly gather in his house a circle of the most learned men in Bologna, before whom she read and maintained a series of theses on the most abstruse philosophical questions. Records of these meetings are given in Charles de Brosses' Lettres sur l'Italie and in the Propositiones Philosophicae, which her father had published in 1738 as an account of her final performance, where she defended 190 philosophical theses.[12]/nHer father remarried twice after Maria's mother died, and Maria Agnesi ended up the eldest of 21 children, including her half-siblings. Her father agreed with her that if she were to continue her mathematics research, then she would be permitted to do all the charity work she wanted.[13] In addition to her performances and lessons, her responsibility was to teach her siblings. This task kept her from her own goal of entering a convent, as she had become strongly religious. Although her father refused to grant this wish, he agreed to let her live from that time on in an almost conventual semi-retirement, avoiding all interactions with society and devoting herself entirely to the study of mathematics.[12] After having read in 1739 the Trait\u00e9 analytique des sections coniques[14] of the Marquis Guillaume de l'H\u00f4pital, she was fully introduced into the field in 1740 by Ramiro Rampinelli, an Olivetan monk who was one of the most notable Italian mathematicians of that time.[15] During that time, Maria studied with him both differential and integral calculus./nAccording to  Britannica, she is \"considered to be the first woman in the Western world to have achieved a reputation in mathematics\". The most valuable result of her labours was the Instituzioni analitiche ad uso della giovent\u00f9 italiana, (Analytical Institutions for the Use of Italian Youth) which was published in Milan in 1748 and \"was regarded as the best introduction extant to the works of Euler\".[7] The goal of this work was, according to Agnesi herself, to give a systematic illustration of the different results and theorems of infinitesimal calculus.[15] The model for her treatise was Le calcul diff\u00e9rentiel et int\u00e9gral dans l\u2019Analyse by Charles Ren\u00e9 Reyneau.[15] In this treatise, she worked on integrating mathematical analysis with algebra.[12] The first volume treats the analysis of finite quantities and the second of the analysis of infinitesimals./nA French translation of the second volume by P.

Many others praised her work, including Pope Benedict XIV, who wrote her a complimentary letter and sent her a gold wreath and a gold medal.[12]/nIn writing this work, Agnesi was advised and helped by two distinguished mathematicians: her former teacher Ramiro Rampinelli and Jacopo Riccati.[15]/nIn Instituzioni analitiche, Agnesi discussed a curve earlier studied and constructed by Pierre de Fermat and Guido Grandi./nAgnesi described the curve as versiera in Italian, which is a synonym for the adjective versoria meaning \"turning in every direction\".[17] At the same time versiera was used as a term for a \"she-devil\" or \"witch\", from Latin Adversarius, an alias for \"devil\" (Adversary of God). Future translations and publications of the Instituzioni analitiche carried forward the former meaning either as a translation error or possibly as a pun.[18] The curve has become known as the \"Witch of Agnesi\".[19]/nAgnesi also wrote a commentary on the Trait\u00e9 analytique des sections coniques du marquis de l'H\u00f4pital which, though highly praised by those who saw it in manuscript, was never published.[20]/nIn 1750, on the illness of her father, she was appointed by Pope Benedict XIV[19] to the chair of mathematics and natural philosophy and physics at Bologna, though she never served.[12] She was the second woman ever to be granted a professorship at a university, Laura Bassi being the first.[21] In 1751, she became ill again and was told not to study by her doctors. After the death of her father in 1752 she carried out a long-cherished purpose by giving herself to the study of theology, and especially of the Fathers and devoted herself to the poor, homeless, and sick, giving away the gifts she had received and begging for money to continue her work with the poor. In 1783, she founded and became the director of the Opera Pia Trivulzio, a home for Milan's elderly, where she lived as the nuns of the institution did.[12] On 9 January 1799, Maria Agnesi died poor and was buried in a mass grave for the poor with fifteen other bodies.[22]/nIn 1996, an asteroid, 16765 Agnesi, was named after Agnesi./nThere is a crater on Venus named Agnesi after her.[23]/nShe is included in a deck of playing cards featuring notable women mathematicians published by the Association of Women in Mathematics.[24]", "68824573": "Joella Hardeman Gipson-Simpson (January 8, 1929 \u2013 January 31, 2012) was an American musician, mathematician, and educator who became the first African American student at Mount St. Mary's College in Los Angeles.[1][2]/nJoella Hardeman was born in Los Angeles on January 8, 1929, and began studying music at age eight.

He took a short-term faculty position at Sheffield University in 1942, and then a similar position in Manchester; he returned to Sheffield in 1945, where (except for a term as visiting faculty at Bristol) he would stay for the rest of his career. He became a lecturer in 1947, earned a Ph.D. from Sheffield in 1949, became senior lecturer in 1958, reader in 1961, and was given a personal chair in 1971./nIn 1953 Mirsky married Aileen Guilding who was, at that time, a lecturer in Biblical History and Literature at Sheffield but later became a professor and Head of Department./nHe retired in September 1983, and died on 1 December 1983.[1][2][5]/nMirsky was an editor of the Journal of Linear Algebra and its Applications, the Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications, and Mathematical Spectrum.[2][3]/nMirsky's early research concerned number theory. He was particularly interested in the r-free numbers, a generalization of the square-free integers consisting of the numbers not divisible by any rth power. These numbers are a superset of the prime numbers, and Mirsky proved theorems for them analogous to Vinogradov's theorem, Goldbach's conjecture, and the twin prime conjecture for prime numbers.[2][3]/nWith Paul Erd\u0151s in 1952, Mirsky proved strong asymptotic bounds on the number of distinct values taken by the divisor function d(n) counting the number of divisors of the number n. If D(n) denotes the number of distinct values of d(m) for m\u00a0\u2264\u00a0n, then[2][3]/nThe Mirsky\u2013Newman theorem concerns partitions of the integers into arithmetic progressions, and states that any such partition must have two progressions with the same difference. That is, there cannot be a covering system that covers every integer exactly once and has distinct differences. This result  is a special case of the Herzog\u2013Sch\u00f6nheim conjecture in group theory; it was conjectured in 1950 by Paul Erd\u0151s and proved soon thereafter by Mirsky and Donald J. Newman. However, Mirsky and Newman never published their proof. The same proof was also found independently by Harold Davenport and Richard Rado.[6]/nIn 1947, Mirsky was asked to teach a course in linear algebra. He soon after wrote a textbook on the subject, An introduction to linear algebra (Oxford University Press, 1955), as well as writing a number of research papers on the subject.[2][3]/nIn his research, Mirsky provided necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of matrices of various types (real symmetric matrices, orthogonal matrices, Hermitian matrices, etc.) with specified diagonal elements and specified eigenvalues.[2]/nHe obtained a tightening of the Birkhoff\u2013von Neumann theorem with H. K. Farahat stating that every doubly stochastic matrix can be obtained as a convex combination of permutation matrices. In Mirsky's version of this theorem, he showed that at most \n\n\n\n\nn\n\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n2\nn\n+\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n^{2}-2n+2}\n\n permutation matrices are needed to represent every \n\n\n\nn\n\u00d7\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n\\times n}\n\n doubly stochastic matrix, and that some doubly stochastic matrices need this many permutation matrices. In modern polyhedral combinatorics, this result can be seen as a special case of Carath\u00e9odory's theorem applied to the Birkhoff polytope. He also worked with Hazel Perfect on the spectra of doubly stochastic matrices.[2]/nIn the mid 1960s, Mirsky's research focus shifted again, to combinatorics, after using Hall's marriage theorem in connection with his work on doubly stochastic matrices. In this area, he wrote the textbook Transversal Theory (Academic Press, 1971), at the same time editing a festschrift for Richard Rado.[3] He derived conditions for pairs of set families to have simultaneous transversals, closely related to later work on network flow problems.[2] He also was one of the first to recognize the importance of transversal matroids,[2][3] and he showed that transversal matroids can be represented using linear algebra over transcendental extensions of the rational numbers.[2]/nMirsky's theorem, a dual version of Dilworth's theorem published by Mirsky in 1971, states that in any finite partially ordered set the size of the longest chain equals the smallest number of antichains into which the set may be partitioned. Although much easier to prove than Dilworth's theorem, it has many of the same consequences.[2][3]", "6368767": "Roland Lvovich Dobrushin (Russian: \u0420\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0434 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u043e\u0301\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0414\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0443\u0301\u0448\u0438\u043d) (July 20, 1929 \u2013 November 12, 1995) was a mathematician who made important contributions to probability theory,[1] mathematical physics,[2] and information theory.[3]/nDobrushin received his Ph.D. at Moscow State University under the supervision of Andrey Kolmogorov./nIn statistical mechanics, he introduced (simultaneously with Lanford and Ruelle) the DLR equations for the Gibbs measure.

The text also includes methods for doing inference in Bayesian networks, and a discussion of influence diagrams, which are Bayesian networks augmented with decision nodes and a value node. Many AI applications have since been developed using Bayesian networks and influence diagrams.[7]/nNeapolitan's \"Probabilistic Reasoning in Expert Systems\"[6] and Judea Pearl's \"Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems\"[8] have been widely recognized as formalizing the field of Bayesian networks, as seen in the works of Eugene Charniak, who, in 1991, noted both texts as the source for Bayesian network inference algorithms;[9] P.W. Jones, who wrote a review of \"Probabilistic Reasoning in Expert Systems\"in 1992;[10] Cooper and Herskovits, who credit Neapolitan's text and Pearl's text for formalizing the theory of belief networks in their 1992 paper that developed the score-based method for learning Bayesian networks from data;[11] and Simon Parsons, who, in 1995, compared the two texts and discussed their roles in establishing the field of probabilistic networks.[12] More recently, in 2008, Dawn Holmes discussed Neapolitan's career and the contribution of his first text.[1]/nIn the 1990s researchers strived to develop methods that could learn Bayesian networks from data. Neapolitan assimilated these efforts in the 2003 text Learning Bayesian Networks,[7] which is the first book addressing learning Bayesian networks. Other Bayesian network books that Neapolitan authored include Probabilistic Methods for Financial and Marketing Informatics,[13] which applies Bayesian networks to problems in finance and marketing; and Probabilistic Methods for Bioinformatics,[14] which applies Bayesian networks to problems in biology. Neapolitan has also written Foundations of Algorithms[15]  and (with Xia Jiang) Artificial Intelligence: With an Introduction to Machine Learning.[16]"}
