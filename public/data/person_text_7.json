He believed that a view of physical space in which space is defined not as a continuum but as a finite set of points was capable of resolving the clash between the continuum aspect of the classic theory of relativity and the discrete aspect of quantum physics. He was strongly influenced by Eddington's view that the various dimensionless and cosmological constants such as the fine structure constant had a unique status or significance as constraints upon the possible values of the natural atomic and cosmological constants of which they are ratios, and hence on all possible measurements. Along with Frederick Parker-Rhodes,  Clive W. Kilmister and John Amson, Ted Bastin is noted for the discovery of, and research on applications of, the so-called combinatorial hierarchy which defines this view of space. While at the Cambridge Language Research Unit (founded by Margaret Masterman) he and Parker-Rhodes used Maurice Wilkes' EDSAC to compute the combinatorial hierarchy. However, the theory gave rise to no testable predictions and was generally regarded as too speculative./nHe was on firmer ground in his objection to the (then generally accepted) Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, and also to other conceptual difficulties, such as the nature and role of observation and measurement, which he regarded as contributing to logical muddle arising from confusing ontological and epistemological aspects of the theory. His assessment of the philosophical difficulties and obscurities in quantum theory that had to be overcome before any change in the basic structure could take place was penetrating; it was only his attempt to overcome the formal difficulties that failed./nHe collaborated with David Bohm to organize the \"Quantum Theory and Beyond\" colloquium at Cambridge University in July 1968, chaired by O. R. Frisch. The colloquium was sponsored by the Royal Society, Carnegie Institution of Science, and Theoria Inc., and resulted in a book by the same name. Bastin worked with David Bohm on other theoretical physics projects as well, particularly by having discussions with the latter on his theory of hidden variables in quantum theory./nBastin was a founding member, with H.

A year later, she married mathematician Hugo Baptista Ribeiro (1910\u201388), who she had met during the course. The couple shared an opposition to the established Estado Novo dictatorship and participated in activities of the Portuguese Communist Party. After graduating she taught mathematics in Lisbon as well as attending seminars given by the mathematician Ant\u00f3nio Aniceto Monteiro.[1][2][3] As a founding member of the Portuguese Mathematical Society, together with Bento de Jesus Cara\u00e7a, she held the position of First Secretary for the 1941/1942 biennium. She returned to that same position in 1946/1947, when her husband was Secretary-General.

She also sent papers to Gazeta de Matem\u00e1tica, on teaching mathematics in Switzerland. Returning to Portugal, the couple faced opposition to science on the part of the Estado Novo, which condemned independent thinking. This forced some scientists into exile. They left the country for the United States where Pilar Ribeiro taught mathematics at Pennsylvania State University.

Phillips) applied results in number theory to Ramanujan graphs, with connections to combinatorics and computer science./nSarnak has made major contributions to analysis and number theory.[3] He is widely recognised internationally as one of the leading analytic number theorists of his generation.[3] His early work on the existence of cusp forms led to the disproof of a conjecture of Atle Selberg.[3] He has obtained the strongest known bounds towards the Ramanujan\u2013Petersson conjectures for sparse graphs, and he was one of the first to exploit connections between certain questions of theoretical physics and analytic number theory.[3] There are fundamental contributions to arithmetical quantum chaos, a term which he introduced, and to the relationship between random matrix theory and the zeros of L-functions.[3] His work on subconvexity for Rankin\u2013Selberg L-functions led to the resolution of Hilbert's eleventh problem.[3] During his career he has held numerous appointments including:/nPeter Sarnak was awarded the P\u00f3lya Prize of the Society for Industrial & Applied Mathematics in 1998, the Ostrowski Prize in 2001, the Levi L.

Ford Award in 2012.[5] He is the recipient of the 2014 Wolf Prize in Mathematics.[6] \nThe University of the Witwatersrand conferred an honorary doctorate on Professor Peter Sarnak on 2 July 2014 for his distinguished contribution to the field of mathematics./nHe was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in 1990 in Kyoto[7] and a plenary speaker at the ICM in 1998 in Berlin.[8]/nHe was also elected as member of the National Academy of Sciences (USA) and Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2002.[3] He became a member of the American Philosophical Society in 2008.[9] He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2010.[10] He was also awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Chicago in 2015 and by Stockholm University in 2023.[11][12] He was elected to the 2018 class of fellows of the American Mathematical Society.[13] In 2019 he became the 10th non-British citizen to ever be awarded the Sylvester Medal of the Royal Society.[14]/n\"All text published under the heading 'Biography' on Fellow profile pages is available under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\" --Royal Society Terms, conditions and policies at the Wayback Machine (archived 2016-11-11)/nThis article incorporates text available under the CC BY 4.0 license.", "184462": "David Harold Bailey (born 14 August 1948) is a mathematician and computer scientist. He received his B.S. in mathematics from Brigham Young University in 1972 and his Ph.D. in mathematics from Stanford University in 1976.[1] He worked for 14 years as a computer scientist at NASA Ames Research Center, and then from 1998 to 2013 as a Senior Scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He is now retired from the Berkeley Lab./nBailey is perhaps best known as a co-author (with Peter Borwein and Simon Plouffe) of a 1997 paper that presented a new formula for \u03c0 (pi), which had been discovered by Plouffe in 1995.  This Bailey\u2013Borwein\u2013Plouffe formula permits one to calculate binary or hexadecimal digits of pi beginning at an arbitrary position, by means of a simple algorithm. Subsequently, Bailey and Richard Crandall showed that the existence of this and similar formulas has implications for the long-standing question of \"normality\"[2]\u2014whether and why the digits of certain mathematical constants (including pi) appear \"random\" in a particular sense./nBailey is a long-time collaborator with the late Jonathan Borwein (Peter's brother). They co-authored five books and over 80 technical papers on experimental mathematics./nBailey also does research in numerical analysis and parallel computing. He has published studies on the fast Fourier transform (FFT), high-precision arithmetic, and the PSLQ algorithm (used for integer relation detection). He is a co-author of the NAS Benchmarks, which are used to assess and analyze the performance of parallel scientific computers. A \"4-step\" method of calculating the FFT is widely known as Bailey's FFT algorithm (Bailey himself credits it to W. M. Gentleman and G. Sande[3])./nHe has also published articles in the area of mathematical finance, including a 2014 paper \"Pseudo-mathematics and financial charlatanism,\" which emphasizes the dangers of statistical overfitting and other abuses of mathematics in the financial field./nIn 1993, Bailey received the Sidney Fernbach award from the IEEE Computer Society, as well as the Chauvenet Prize[4] and the Hasse Prize from the Mathematical Association of America. In 2008 he was a co-recipient of the Gordon Bell Prize from the Association for Computing Machinery. In 2017 he was a co-recipient of the Levi L.

Originally trained in mathematics, mathematical physics, and chemistry in the 1950s, he went on to study philosophy from 1956 to 1959. In 1960, after teaching mathematical physics, engineering, and commerce to undergraduates, and special relativity and differential equations to graduate students, McShane began studying theology. He did his fourth year of theology in 1963 and in 1968 began reading economics./nIn a period that spanned over sixty years, McShane published numerous articles and twenty-five books.[1] His publications range from technical works on the foundations of mathematics, probability theory, evolutionary process, and omnidisciplinary methodology, to introductory texts focusing on critical thinking, linguistics, and economics. He also wrote essays on the philosophy of education. Beginning in 1970, he participated in and helped organize a number of international workshops and conferences addressing topics such as \"ongoing collaboration,\"[2] reforms in education, and communicating the basic insights of two-flow economics.[3]/nTwo Festschrift volumes were published to honor McShane, one in 2003[4] and the second in 2022. In the first, eighteen individuals contributed essays, and, at the request of the editor, McShane submitted an essay as well.[5] He also replied to the eighteen contributors in the essay \"Our Journaling Lonelinesses: A Response.\u201d[6] In the second Festschrift, twenty-four individuals wrote essays remembering and honoring McShane,[7] who was nominated for the Templeton Prize in 2011 and 2015./nMcShane  was born in  Baileboro, County Cavan.[8] When the McShane family moved to Dublin, Philip went to O'Connell School. He continued his education while training as a Jesuit at University College Dublin (BSc and MSc in relativity theory and quantum mechanics), St Stanislaus College, Tullabeg (Lic. Phil), Heythrop College (STL) and Campion Hall, Oxford (D.Phil.).[9] He lectured in mathematics at University College Dublin (1959-1960) and in Philosophy at the Milltown Institute of Theology and Philosophy (1968-1973)./nMcShane entered the Jesuits in September 1950 and spent two years in spiritual formation.[10] In 1952, in spite of having \"acquired  a 'broken head,' which meant he was unable to study, or even to do any serious reading, he was also allowed to risk a very challenging programme of mathematics, mathematical physics, physics and chemistry.\"[11]  Eleven years later, after completing a B.Sc., an M.Sc. in relativity theory and quantum mechanics, and a Licentiate of Philosophy, he was ordained a Jesuit priest./nIn 1956, McShane \"shifted from graduate studies of mathematics and physics that included such works as the classic Space-Time Structure by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger,\"[12] and embarked on what would be a lifelong venture of reading and appropriating the works of Bernard Lonergan, initially through a careful study of Lonergan's Verbum articles,[13] followed by a startling study Insight.[14]  In the years that followed, he co-authored (with Garret Barden) Towards: Self-Meaning and wrote Music That Is Soundless. In the mid-1960s, he studied at Oxford University, where in August 1969 he successfully defended his doctoral thesis \"The Concrete Logic of Discovery of Statistical Science,\" which soon after was published as Randomness, Statistics, and Emergence.[15] After the First International Lonergan Conference in Florida 1970, McShane took on the task of editing two volumes of the papers presented at that event.[16] In 1972, he decided to leave the Jesuits.[17]/nIn 1975, along with Conn O'Donovan, McShane founded the Dublin Lonergan Centre, in Milltown Park, Dublin.[18] In 1979, he served as visiting fellow in religious studies at Lonergan College, Concordia University, Montreal. In his course, McShane encouraged students to work through the exercises in his introductory book Wealth of Self and Wealth of Nations.[19] From 1974 until 1994, McShane taught philosophy at Mount Saint Vincent University, Halifax, Nova Scotia. When he retired from teaching in 1995, he began writing prolifically.[20] After retiring, McShane also accepted invitations to speak at international conferences and workshops. He gave keynote addresses at gatherings in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America./nIn the last years of his life, McShane wrote about the negative Anthropocene age in which we live and a future positive Anthropocene age of luminous collaboration.[21] In Questing2020, his final series of essays, he wrote of the possibility of human collaboration mirroring the psychic adaptation of starling murmuration.[22] When McShane died in July 2020, colleagues and former students around the globe paid tribute to him. A theologian from Africa described him as akin to an \"African elder,\"[23] another as someone who \"gave counsel to think long-term, in terms of centuries rather than years or even decades,\"[24] and a third as \"someone I could always be myself around, even when I was angsty, anxious, or depressed \u2026 a friend, mentor, professor, and family member all at once.\"[25] A former student described \"being amazed, when I asked him some questions, at his generosity\u2014he tore out a chapter of something he was working on and gave it to me there and then.\"[26]/nBy his own account, McShane was humbled as a young man by the works of Chopin and fortunate to have discovered Descartes' achievement in geometry.[27] He wrote about \"the luck of working with Lochlainn O'Raifeartaigh in graduate studies of mathematical physics in the mid-fifties.\"[28] He also studied and had a keen appreciation for Richard Feynman's Lectures on Physics, especially the third lecture.[29] McShane was fond of and often quoted the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Patrick Kavanaugh. \"Having music in his genes,\"[30] he often referred to particular pieces of music. For example, the quiet emergence of five notes that grow to dominate Bruckner's 8th symphony was symbolic for him of the slow emergence of effective global collaborartion. \"Bruckner's 8th has been symbolic for me of the climb to effective functional scientific collaboration: a five note echo trickling in at the beginning of the second movement and finally taking over the symphony: so, we trickle in at, we hope, the beginning of the second movement of the Anthropocene.\"[31]/nIn his \"story of history,\"[32] McShane referred to the works of Karl Jaspers, Arnold Toynbee, and Eric Voegelin and identified an axial period of \"fragmented consciousness, a transition between what Lonergan calls the two times of the temporal subject.\"[33] There are references to the teachings of the Buddha, the music of Beethoven, and the works of James Clerk Maxwell in Bernard Lonergan: His Life and Leading Ideas.[34] In an essay written for a conference on peaceful coexistence,[35] he cited Elizabeth Barrett Browning's \"Aurora Leigh\" and William Shakespeare's Henry IV, and referred to Archimedes' \"leap of inventiveness\" when he created a hydrodynamic screw to raise water. In the same essay, he referred to Ezra Pound's image of a vortex as symbolic of a global community \"committed to a science of cosmic care ... redeeming time from the mad destructive greed of the 'civilized' majority of the present global population.\"[36]/nVarious women influenced and shaped McShane's worldview. His extensive writings on the \"Interior Lighthouse\"[37] were inspired by Teresa of \u00c1vila's Interior Castle.[38] McShane resonated with the English novelist and poet Mary Ann Evans, who went by the name of Georg Eliot. He regularly cited this line from the middle of Eliot's Middlemarch: \"If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel\u2019s heart beat, and we should die of that roar which is the other side of silence. As it is, the quickest of us walk about well-wadded with stupidity.\u201d[39] McShane cited more than a dozen times the lyrics of songs on Sinead O'Connor's album Faith and Courage in Lonergan's Standard Model of Effective Global Inquiry.[40] His appreciation and admiration of greatness extended to the performances of Serena Williams and Venus Williams on the tennis court,[41] the lifework of Nadia Boulanger, who was very much on McShane's mind when he wrote Process in the late 1980s,[42] and to \u201cMolly Bloom\u2019s long Gospel-speech,\u201d[43] which McShane cited time and again. In his writings on economics, he regularly cited the British economist Joan Robinson, who was well known for her disagreement with standard economics, especially American economics.[44] He also referred to the work of Jane Jacobs, with whom he corresponded.[45]/nIn a lecture introducing the economic analysis of Lonergan at Fordham University in January 2000,[46] McShane quoted Stephen McKenna. When McKenna discovered the writings of Plotinus in his late 30s, he pondered the possibility of translating The Enneads from Greek into English and decided \"this is worth a life.\" It could be said that McShane made a similar decision when he discovered the works of Bernard Lonergan. He described the \"central contribution\" of his doctoral thesis in these terms: \"It is an attempt to establish on a wider basis of contemporary mathematics and science the position of B. Lonergan on the nature of randomness, statistics, and emergence.\"[47] Thirty years after completing his thesis, McShane edited for publication Lonergan's economic manuscript For a New Political Economy,[48] and two years later Phenomenology and Logic: The Boston College Lectures on Mathematical Logic and Existentialism.[49] He regularly referred to the final two chapters of the latter as a resource for trying to identify and come to grips with both the ontic and phyletic aspects of the \"existential gap.\"[50]/nFor more than 60 years, McShane diligently read and reread Insight: A Study of Human Understanding,[51] and is arguably the leading interpreter of this compendious work. In the essay \"Insight and the Trivialization of History,\" he described having been \"enormously fortunate in coming to Insight in 1957 after graduate studies in general relativity and quantum electrodynamics.\"[52] In 2011, McShane was recognized for his contributions to Lonergan studies at the West Coast Methods Institute's 26th Annual Fallon Memorial Lonergan Symposium at Loyola Marymount University./nThe cultivation of an adequate worldview was a focus of McShane's early writings, and remained so throughout his life, although in the later years of his life he would write of Praxisweltanschauung.[54] In his rather peculiar doctoral thesis,[55] McShane aimed to reorient the philosophy of science away from general considerations towards a reflection on scientific praxis, again, through a two-fold attention of the mathematician, physicist, biophysicist, and biochemist.  He claimed that the world view \"emergent probability\"[56] is a verifiable, anticipatory heuristic that is not \"abstract\" in the pejorative sense of the word./nThe Weltanschauung thus given is not a set of abstract propositions or a speculative metaphysics, but a structured anticipation. Moreover, that anticipation may not be the methodical anticipation of the results of just one science, but an integrated anticipation of the results of a hierarchy of sciences, such indeed as our inclusive principle of emergent probability provides.[57]/nRegarding the publication of his Oxford doctoral thesis, McShane wrote that \"the book might well have been subtitled Towards an Adequate Weltanschauung.\"[58] This claim might appear odd, even exaggerated, given the questions he dealt with in his thesis\u2014ostensibly specialized questions in the philosophy of math, physics, biophysics, and biochemistry.  McShane's position, stated in the original preface, is that a viewpoint on the relationship of physics to chemistry and chemistry to botany is part of an adequate worldview. \"Without that thought one lacks a basic component for the conception of world process. The present work deals with the central element and the heuristic conception of world process.\"[59]/nIn Music That Is Soundless (1969), he wrote about what he considered a core component of a comprehensive worldview: our human capacity and need for conversations, or what he called \"Bud A,\"[60]  a \"bud in our birth that clamours in solitude.\"[61]  The book is an invitation to attend to \"the conversation that we are\" (H\u00f6lderlin) by asking self-attentively: \"When was I last understanding, understood? When did I last speak? When did I last listen?[62]/nAt the heart of the worldview that McShane wrote about, taught, and advocated is the human capacity and need for a particular doubling. We humans are capable of having conversations about conversations while asking ourselves what happens when we are truly understanding, listening, and speaking.[63] Patient contemplation can lead us to a better understanding of understanding, a better listening to listening, and a better speaking of speaking. Regarding the basic question, When was my last real conversation? \"one may honestly find that one has little or no data,\"[64] especially if cultural conditions are not favorable to real conversations: \"Ten thousand people, maybe more / People talking without speaking / People hearing without listening.\"[65]/nIn the introductory book Wealth of Self and Wealth of Nations (1975), which might have been subtitled \"Towards an Adequate Worldview,\"[66] the double focus took the form of an invitation to appropriate, in as much detail as possible, the \"inner\"[67]  dynamics of the process of understanding why, for example, the rule for getting square roots actually works. McShane included some simple diagrams in this book to help the reader appropriate, or \"self-taste,\" what-ing (chapters 2 and 3), is-ing (chapters 4 and 5), what-to-do-ing (chapter 6), believing (chapter 7), symbolizing conveniently and judiciously (chapter 8), and exploring potentialities for living through the arts (chapter 9).[68]   In the final chapter of this book, McShane made the remarkable claim that a change of framework, or point of view, is both possible and desirable if humans are to survive. But there is a Catch-22: \"The need for change in point of view is thoroughly clear only from a changed point of view.\"[69]/nIn the Epilogue to Music That Is Soundless, McShane wrote that \"to raise with seriousness the question, What is understanding? is to venture into a quest of scientific dimensions.\"[70] What 'scientific dimensions' meant to him in 1968 was mediated by his study of relativity theory and quantum mechanics at University College, Dublin (1952\u201356). In both his doctoral thesis and \"Image and Emergence: Towards and Adequate Weltanschauung\"[71] (one of two papers he wrote for an international congress that took place in Florida in 1970), McShane was traveling along what he would later call \"Butterfield Way.\"[72]/nOrganic development had been a topic of interest for McShane in the 1960s, and in fact was a possible topic of his thesis. \"I recall especially wanting to see could I lift the biological logic of someone like Woodger into a full genetic logic.\"[73]  What he knew would have been a \"lengthy aside\"[74] in the doctoral thesis, became one of his central interests around 2005, when he took a serious interest in development, in part because of Robert Doran's question \"What is systematic theology?\"[75]  In the spring of 2008, McShane decided to write a series of essays to better read a single paragraph in Insight about three steps for studying organic development. A first step is to descriptively differentiate different parts of an organism;[76]  a second step is to accumulate a group of insights relating various parts to events and operations; and/na third step is to effect the transition from the thing-for-us to the thing-itself, from insights that grasp described parts as organs to insights that grasp conjugate forms systematizing otherwise coincidental manifold of chemical and physical processes. By this transition one links physiology with biochemistry and biophysics. To this end, there have to be invented appropriate symbolic images of the relevant chemical and physical processes.[77]/nMcShane identified the three-step procedure for studying organic development as perhaps the most obscure challenge for scholars with an interest in the works of Lonergan.[78] He would add to the obscure challenge by adding the word self to the sentence to highlight the starting point of a study of the developing human: \"Self-study of an organism begins from the thing-for-us, from the organism as exhibited to our senses.\"[79] He referred to the need to bring the study of human development under heuristic control as \"a missing link.\"[80]/nIn Interpretation from A to Z (2020), McShane was still focused on the methodological study of organic development.[81] The central problem was and is the genesis of a genetic viewpoint that will replace \"daft reductionism that chatters away about genes and information theory.\"[82] In this, the last book published in his lifetime, he referred to the challenge as \"the up-grading of Aristotle, whose flaw is merely his time in history.\"[83]  In chapter \"J ~ Inventing Techniques,\" he wrote that the invention and implementation of convenient and appropriate symbolic images is \"the honest starting place of a genuine science of humanity,\" an \"issue that has to be faced in the contemporary reality\"[84] of what he called aggreformism, a word he coined in 1969 to refer to a sublation of Aristotelian hylemorphism. The contemporary need is to create an ethos of inventing convenient symbols and reading, for example, the semicolons in the expression f (pi\u00a0; cj\u00a0; bk\u00a0; zi\u00a0; um\u00a0; rn)[85] or another appropriate symbolic expression. In either case, the symbolism protects those studying development from \"substituting pseudo-metaphysical mythmaking for scientific inquiry.\"[86] McShane wrote that \"the semicolons point to the complex solution to the root problem hierarchy theory\u2014aggreformism\u2014a problem that baffles the systems theorists\u2014when they notice it\u2014and the followers of Bertalanffy.\"[87]/nIn 1968 McShane began reading Lonergan's 1944 manuscript \"Essay in Circulation Analysis\" and made his first attempt to present the material in the summer of 1977. By his own account, he \"estimated that [he] had spent twenty hours on each page of the manuscript over a period of about five years.\"[88] On various occasions and in various countries\u2014including Australia, Canada, India, Korea, Mexico, and the U.S.\u2014he presented the key issues underlying the significant transition from the Marxist, neo-Marxist, Keynesian, and neo-Keynesian analyses to an empirically verifiable analysis.[89] In January 2000, McShane gave a series of lectures on Lonergan's economics at Fordham University's Lincoln Center campus in New York City.[90] Ten years later, he was invited to give the keynote address and lead discussions at a three-day conference on economic theory in Nashik, India.[91]/nIn his published works on economics, McShane explored different facets of what he called \u201ca triple paradigm shift in economic thinking\u201d that he attributed to Lonergan.[92] One shift is to a theory of two-flow dynamic analysis that will replace one-flow static analysis. With a bow to Schumpeter, McShane identified this shift as \u201ca theory of economics dynamics that definitely crosses the Rubicon.\u201d[93] A second shift is to an emerging framework of global collaboration that, in good time, will subsume all disciplines, all fields of study.[94]  The third shift is \u201ctowards a deep and precise plumbing of the depths and heights of human desire and imagination.\u201d[95]/nMcShane drew the following analogy to identify the shift to two-flow economics. Newton reached for a theory of motion that would unify the physics earthly motions and celestial bodies, something that was beyond both Kepler and Galileo. In a sense, he reduced two types of motion to one. The leap to two-flow economics is one that does not reduce, but differentiates, for example between the consumption of a submarine sandwich bought at the local delicatessen and the \u201cconsumption\u201d of the meat slicer used to make the sandwich. \u201cInstead of Newton\u2019s great leap to get two into one, we have a great leap of getting one into two.\u201d[96]/nThe basic oversight that permeates the current study and implementation of economic models is the failure to identify a split in the productive process, one that needs to be made before adding variables such as banks, taxes, and international trading. \u201cThere is a type of firm that is pregnant with consumer goods: think of the restaurants in Chinatown or Little Italy. There is also the type of firm that is in the business of providing, say, varieties of large cooking ovens in restaurants all over the borough.\u201d[97] Melding two firms into one has been institutionalized by publishers, research universities, and even papal initiatives over a period of more than 200 years. McShane refers to this as \u201ca staleness of perspective and a settled non-scientific attitude that has haunted economic studies for centuries.\u201d[98]  He claimed that the perspective and attitude haunts the diligent research of Thomas Piketty and James Galbraith, as \u201cthe drive represented by these and other groups who hover round the issue of inequality of income is not sufficiently scientific in its classificatory backing to escape my extremely odd view that their efforts do not escape the category of statistically-infested journalism.\u201d[99]/nMcShane's view is that the search for new data to cast light on old questions\u2014for example, whether new inequality metrics are needed and how inequality of household incomes might be estimated\u2014must clear-headedly and consistently keep in mind \u201cthe fact that there are two types of firms, a simple local analysis that nevertheless leads to there being pretty well two of everything.\u201d[100]  Without identifying two-firms, different phases of economic development,[101]  and the possibility of dynamically balanced cross-over payments between two distinct economic circuits,[102] intimations of improvements in standards of living without economics slumps[103]  tend to sound like pie in the sky, while analyses of national and transnational exchanges tend to be \u201cgrossly unhelpful.\u201d[104]/nIn various writings, McShane cited the work of Arnie N\u00e6ss, the father of \u201cdeep ecology.\u201d In 1989, while in Oxford writing Process: Introducing Themselves to Young (Christian) Minders,  \u201cdetecting, leaning into India, of history\u2019s effort to educate us, I was astonished to find his [N\u00e6ss's] detecting of a parallel structure of cosmic deliberation.\u201d[105]  Thirty years later, while writing \u201cStructuring the Reach Towards the Future\u201d for The 3rd Peaceful Coexistence Colloquium in Helsinki, Finland (June 2019), he returned to Naess's work for the first time since he had read it thirty years earlier in Oxford.[106]/nMcShane maintained that N\u00e6ss was on to something, for example, when he wrote: \u201cApplied to humans, the complexity-not-complication principle favours division of labour, not fragmentation of labour.\u201d[107] The challenge is to discover and implement a way to intervene effectively in intertwined cycles of natural-historical processes.[108] The web of intertwined processes currently presents humans of all colors and creeds with a myriad of challenges that include biodiversity loss and species extinction, water scarcity, unemployment, and children\u2019s health and education. It is no mean problem if one is mindful of the needed restart in economics, not to mention other areas in need of reformation such as education./nBeginning in the late 1960s, McShane wrote about this \u201cturn to the idea\u201d[109] of dividing up labor, citing the influence of Bernard Lonergan,[110] who also wrote about dividing up intellectual labor after puzzling about how that might be done efficiently for more than thirty years. In Method in Theology, after briefly describing a conception of method as an art and second conception of method as a successful science, where \u201cscience means natural science\u201d and \u201ctheologians often have to be content if their subject is included in a list not of sciences but of academic disciplines,\u201d[111] he described the needed \u201cturn to the idea\u201d of efficient collaboration in these words: \u201cSome third way, then, must be found and, even though it is difficult and laborious, that price must be paid if the less successful subject is not to remain a mediocrity or slip into decadence and desuetude.\u201d[112]/nThe idea is to divide up the labor of caring for the cosmos \u201cfunctionally,\u201d so not along the lines of disciplinary silos, but along the lines of \u201cdistinct and separable stages in a single process from data to ultimate results.\u201d[113] The various stages, steps, or specializations are essentially open and reciprocally dependent successive partial contributions to communicating to \u201cthe almost endlessly varied sensibilities, mentalities, interests, and tastes of [humankind].\u201d[114]/nMcShane wrote about the needed turn sketched by Lonergan's in the 1969 Gregorianum article in various works.[115] In chapter 5 of The Allure of the Compelling Genius of History, he compared Lonergan's breakthrough discovery to the invention of Hedy Lamarr of a torpedo-guidance system, a system which depended on what she called \u201cfrequency hopping.\u201d \u201cIn that chapter [5], an article of 1969, Lonergan came \u2018to invent a fundamental wireless technology,\u2019\u2020 which will slowly come to thrive in post-modern technologies of guidance and communication.\u201d[116]/nOne of McShane\u2019s contributions to implementing transdiciplinary collaboration was to identify disciplinary \u201csloping.\u201d In the essay \"Slopes: An Encounter,\" he wrote that \"as the disciplines move up from research through interpretation to history and to dialectic, there is a convergence of data and interest.\"[117] He wrote the following about Lonergan's breakthrough to restructuring of theology, indeed of all areas of study\u2014a point that Karl Rahner caught and made[118] against those who might claim the prescribed eightfold division of labor is strictly theological method:/nNow he had found it, so to speak, on a string, in a String Theory of the Cosmos of meaning. The scattered beads of disciplinary sweat could be seen now as strung together sweetly. The jumble of theology\u2019s fragmented areas \u2013 Scripture studies, doctrines, history, dialectical and pastoral scholarship \u2013 strung together in a circle of eight handing-round efforts.[119]/nIn his keynote address \u201cArriving in Cosmopolis,\u201d which McShane wrote for the First Latin-American Lonergan Workshop in Puebla, Mexico, June 2011, he estimated the numbers of specialists\u2014identified by Lonergan as researchers, interpreters, historians, dialecticians, foundational (persons), doctrines or policy (makers), systematizers, and communicators\u2014efficiently collaborating around the globe when the earth's total population reaches 10 billion. In the same essay, he placed what is called the Standard Model in physics within a larger standard model of global collaboration, one that situates the dynamics of physics within a dynamics of human progress.[120]/nWhile McShane identified the implementation of genetic method as Lonergan's most obscure challenge to his disciples, he identified dialectic as his clearest challenge,[121] though by no means the easiest.  It is hard to say how many tens of thousands of words he wrote about the structure of dialectic,[122] which he described as a \u201cshocking, brilliant, innovative, invitation.\"[123] To arrive at an approximation, one would need to consider various website essay series,[124] as well as published articles and chapters in books.[125]  As with other areas of focus and interest, McShane's prodigious writings and teachings on the structure of dialectic call for the kind of creative research and communal recycling that he did his best to initiate./nIn an attempt to communicate the challenge popularly and without footnotes, McShane wrote three chapters on dialectic in Futurology Express. There he described dialectic as a mix of private and public tasks of dialectic elders who are flexible, \u201clike the flexibility of a great tennis player meeting the oddest of volleys,\u201d[126] and who have \u201cminds grasping for the flickers of integral human goings-on.\u201d[127] He related this to the task of Comparison, one of six italicized words in Lonergan's terse description of the structure of dialectic. He adds that those doing Comparison are competent in scientific understanding and autobiographically appreciative of the lengthy, patient messing around required to become intelligently competent, as opposed to merely technically competent. \u201cThe issue is the personal cultivation of what is called authentic nescience.\u201d[128] Dialectic becomes radically public when dialecticians \u201clay their cards on the table,\u201d check one another by asking basic questions, even about themselves, and strive for a hard-won consensus on \u201cwhat might be called an idealized version of previous reaches of humanity, showing the past something better than it was.\u201d[129]/nIn a book published posthumously, McShane identified dialectic as needed \u201cto link Aristotle\u2019s three [data, theory, verification] with Drucker\u2019s [policy, planning, executive strategies] and fill out the elements in N\u00e6ss.\u201d[130] He claimed that what is missing and desperately needed by those concerned about sustainability and survival is methodical deliberation about deliberation. \u201cDeliberating over Archimedes\u2019 deliberation is to push us towards a radical effective shift in our view of the disorientations of industrious humanity.\u201d[131]/nMcShane\u2019s invitation to contemporaries to lay their cards on the table regarding their personal views on serious understanding reached a humorous, brutally honest, and possibly disturbing high point in one of his final essays, \u201cOn the Stile of a Crucial Experiment.\u201d[132] In the first paragraph of this essay, he recalled a scene from the film Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, a shootout when Virgil and Morgan Earp called out members of a group of outlaws called The Cowboys. \"It was a calling-out of the usual sort in Western films, with the good guys and the bad guys clearly identified.\"[133] In the last paragraph of the essay, McShane did his own calling-out:/nThere is, then, my simple calling out, which is just a repeat of Lonergan\u2019s: this is the technique of discomforting intersubjectivity that is capable of \u201cproviding a statistically effective form for the next cycle of human action.\u201d[134] There is my broader calling out: I challenge you to check\u2014that word in its many senses\u2014your biased corralled stile-sitting against serious understanding.[135] Both my simple call and my broader call-out is to global humanity and not just to Lonergan students, but I have sung out that joke abundantly already.[136]/nThe proposed \u201cturn to the idea\u201d of beautiful, efficient global collaborators intending \u201ccumulative and progressive results,\u201d[137] with a sub-group \u201cbearing fruit\u201d[138] in local communications, clashes with notions of \u201cpure science\u201d as opposed to \u201capplied science,\u201d and notions of \u201chard sciences\u201d as opposed to arts, humanities, and social sciences. These notions tend to dominate both popular culture and academic praxis. The first set of contrasting notions, which was popularly expressed in the American television sitcom The Big Bang Theory,[139]  still permeates many a worldview. The second set permeates current divisions of majors, departments, and schools in higher education. It also permeates efforts to use \u201cstrictly\u201d or \u201cpurely scientific\u201d criteria to establish a precise meaning of Anthropocene,[140] and to pin down where and when the purported new geologic epic began. The ongoing effort to locate a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (informally known as \"golden spike\") on the part of the Anthropocene Working Group assumes a methodological divide between scientists, humanists, social scientists, and others.[141] It would seem that \"aesthetic loneliness\" is on the periphery of scientific method while scientific wonder is on the periphery of a liberal arts education.[142]/nIn various places McShane traced the implicit or explicit views to Aristotelian notions of speculative and practical science.[143]  It is an age-old belief and expectation that contrasts practice (from Ancient Greek \u03c0\u03c1\u1fb6\u03be\u03b9\u03c2 [pr\u00e2xis]\u2014human doing and action, the conduct resulting from deliberations and the choices humans make), theory (from Greek \u03b8\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 [the\u014dria]\u2014contemplation, speculation), and making (from Greek \u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 [poi\u0113sis]). For Arisotle, praxis differs from theory, making, and the technology used in producing what is made.[144] While both theory and practice involve thinking, the former aims at \"speculative\" or \"theoretical\" knowledge of what is unchanging, while the latter aims at practical, less precise knowledge of human actions.[145] It would have made no sense to Arisotle to ask if there were fundamental questions about nature (from Greek \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 [physis]) whose solution depends on the character of the individual studying nature.[146]/nTo shake up and out a rather odd meaning of \u201cmetaphysics,\u201d[147]  as well as what he described as \u201ca psychology conservatively grounded in a certain facticity of the past,\u201d[148]  McShane replaced the word metaphysics with futurology,[149] later with engineering.[150]  He envisaged a globally shared Praxisweltanschauung of engineering progress, an \u201cadequate geogenetic heuristics of history.\u201d[151] In the last essay of the \u00c6cornomics series, titled \u201cEngineering as Dialectic,\u201d he wrote optimistically of \u201csome few people who will face the details of seeding the slow, serious, self-sacrificing \u2018resolute and effective intervention in this historical process.\u2019\u201d[152]/nWith regard to a possible shared Praxisweltanschauung, McShane regularly posed this question: \u201cDo you view humanity as possibly maturing\u2014in some serious way\u2014or messing along between good and evil, whatever you think they are?\u201d[153] Expressing and defending one's position effectively moves one beyond Weltanschauung to Praxisweltanschauung, even if one's view is that theory and praxis are as different as carrying out specialized research at CERN and signing and implementing the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse emissions and limit global warning to 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C. Furthermore, expressing and defending one's view about the future of humanity autobiographically, and in the company of others doing the same,[154] is an intimation of doing dialectic, which requires brutal honesty, for example, about one's view regarding the place of heuristic structures and convenient symbolisms in engineering progress.[155]/nOne criticism of McShane's work was that the language he used, the neologisms he created, and the style of his writings were unnecessarily obscure and were off-putting for some readers whom, at times, he addressed directly: \u201cI will not in fact be talking here about systems of philosophy. I will be talking about the reader, you, and asking you to attend to yourself, to ask yourself certain simple questions, to reach elementary answers.\u201d[156] Time and again, he encouraged his readers to take our eyes of the page while reading and cited what Gaston Bachelard wrote in The Poetics of Space about reading a house or a nest with one's eyes off the page.[157]  His colleague and long-time friend Conn O\u2019Donovan recalled reading the typescript of Plants and Pianos in 1971 and \u201cthinking that McShane\u2019s written expression was not as precise as it might be, that he was beginning to let language run away with him.\u201d[158]  Some thirty years after reading that typescript, O\u2019Donovan asked:/nWas I then witnessing in McShane the emergence of a deliberate, self-consciously new approach to language and meaning? Was he perhaps deciding to allow language to run away with him, but somehow under his control, and not to allow himself to be controlled by already controlled meaning? Was this a key moment in the development of his own special kind of creative scholarly writing?[159]/nAnother colleague wrote in his tribute to McShane that while he \u201ccould be very orderly and disciplined in his writings and lectures, not infrequently in later years both types of his presentations were sprinkled with verbal novelties, asides, puns, jokes, and other unusual elements.  Some colleagues find that this style facilitates their understanding, but others find that it impedes it.\u201d[160] A younger colleague wrote in his contribution to the same Festschrift that \u201csoon after Method was published [1972], Phil seized on Lonergan\u2019s notion of \u2018linguistic feedback\u2019 and its essential role in advancing self-appropriation, both phylogenetically and ontogenetically. For years, he practically flogged the theme of linguistic feedback.\u201d[161]  An example of such feedback is replacing the letter \u201cc\u201d with the letter \u201ck\u201d in the word heuristic or pocket.[162]/nOne of the most extensive published criticisms of McShane's language, style, and clarity occurred in 2001 before the publication of Lonergan's Phenomenology and Logic, which McShane edited and introduced. One of the readers invited by the University of Toronto Press to review McShane's editor's introduction and appendix had significant reservations and asked him to rewrite the appendix or eliminate it altogether.[163]  The reader questioned his \u201cintent on mystifying\u201d what is \u201calready familiar to every competent phenomenologist,\u201d and added that \u201cLonergan himself, in this reader\u2019s opinion, was not in the least inclined towards esotericism or mystification.\u201d[164]/nIn his reply to the reader, McShane wrote that his efforts to contextualize the volume were aimed at \u201csaving it from haute vulgarization,\u201d[165]  or what he would sometimes call negative haute vulgarization\u2014the clear, direct expression that \u201cJoey\u201d had hoped to find in the editor's introduction. He also recalled a favorite quote from Samuel Beckett, about direct expression:/nHere is direct expression\u2212pages and pages of it. And if you don't understand it, Ladies and Gentlemen, it is because you are too decadent to receive it. You are not satisfied unless form is so strictly divorced from content that you can comprehend the one almost without bothering to read the other. This rapid skimming and absorption of the scant cream of sense is made possible by what I may call a continuous process of salivation. The form that is an arbitrary and independent phenomenon can fulfill no higher function than that of a stimulus for a tertiary or quartary conditioned reflex of dribbling comprehension.[166]/nHad McShane gone too far or, perhaps, not far enough? While writing about the short-term challenge of implementing a child-friendly pedagogy pivoting on the \"Childout Principle,\"[167] he acknowledged that a key challenge was to do something requiring a cultural shift and a new language: \u201cYou might begin to write yourself and the world with a new alphabet, in a new language. \u2018The alphabet writes the world, and the world comes to pass through the alphabet: writing and world coexist in a state of feverish rapture that defies language.'\"[168]/nIn 1977 McShane applied to the Canada Council for a grant to work on economics. One of the assessors of his application wrote: \u201cWhat we have here is a case of two idiosyncratic theologians trying to do idiosyncratic economics. The probability of this being fruitful is not zero, but it is not much higher.\u201d[169] Thirty years later, when McShane addressed an audience at University Seoul, a professor in the audience denied anything idiosyncratic or original in what McShane was presenting and remarked \u201cit is all in Mankiw,\u201d[170] referring to Gregory Mankiw\u2019s introductory economics textbook and blockbuster bestseller Principles of Economics.[171] More recently, the Australian economist Paul Oslington has written a critique of Lonergan\u2019s economics that includes a critique of McShane for \u201coverselling\u201d Lonergan's economics in the editor's introduction to For a New Political Economy.[172]/nMcShane considered the basic insights of two-flow economic analysis empirically verifiable and accessible to high school students.[173] He did, however, recognize that it would not be easy \"to change a recipe that is 200 years old.\"[174] In addition, he identified a needed correction to a mistake he had made in the area of the pedagogy. In his 2019 essay \u201cFinding an Effective Economist: A Central Theological Challenge,\u201d McShane described his mistake in these words:/nLooking back now with wonderful hindsight, we [Lonergan and he] were making the wrong moves. We should have put his request of 1968 in the context of the eighth functional specialty\u2019s follow-through that I call C9. The mood of statistically-effective outreach should have dominated both my two 1977 presentations and his six years of teaching.[175]/nWhat McShane described as \"the mood of statistically-effective outreach\" refers to teaching as communications, a type of direct discourse that is related to but distinct from the indirect discourse of research, interpretation, and history. Direct communications \u2212 which invites, persuades, and cajoles students, colleagues, friends, and neighbors to makes sense out of distinct flows of basic and non-basic (surplus) goods and services \u2212 might generate \"backfires,\"[176] for example when a bright students asks what an IS/LM curve (also known as the IS/LM model) is and why it is not viable for real economic analysis.[177] While McShane wrote introductory texts, including the preface to the 2017 edition of Economics for Everyone inviting the serious reader to imagine \"the concrete reality of, say, a small bakery in its dependence on firms that supply its needs,\"[178] he also recognized the need for \"massively innovative primers that would meet millennial needs, 500-page texts of empirically rich, locally oriented, normatively focused non-truncated writing.\"[179]/nAn implicit criticism of McShane breaking with tradition occurred during the planning stages of the conference \u201cRevisiting Lonergan\u2019s Anthropology\u201d that took place in Rome in November 2013.[180] The organizers of the event did not invite him to take part in the event, either by giving a talk or by participating in one of the various panels. McShane, who was never interested in founding a \u201ca little school of Lonergan at the Gregorian\u201d[181] or at some other Jesuit university in North America, published a critique of the conference in Rome, which for him symbolized what he called Lonerganism.[182]/nI have, in recent years, made quite clear my disagreement with that tradition that now prevails in Lonergan studies, of avoiding the challenge of functional collaboration. Indeed, of not noticing, ignoring, avoiding\u2014whatever\u2014that the question, \u201cWhat does Lonergan mean by functional collaboration?\u201d has not been taken seriously by the group. I thus give a definite meaning to the boldfaced word whatever by my title: the group seems\u2014indeed quite evidently is\u2014intent on muzzling the scientific Lonergan.[183]/nLike Lonergan, McShane took seriously what Butterfield wrote about the scientific revolution \"outshining everything since the rise of Christianity and reducing the Renaissance and Reformation to the rank of mere episodes, mere internal displacements, within the system of medieval Christendom.\"[184] Both men advocated the development and implementation of apt symbolism and heuristic structures.[185] This had and continues to have what might be called an \"electrifying\" effect upon those in academic disciplines that seem to thrive without implementing symbolism and heuristics. \u201cWhether it is Cij or W3, the symbolism reminds, cajoles, and forces the authors not to sit comfortably on the fence between commonsense eclecticism and scientific collaboration.\u2020 The symbols, you might even say, are a way of electrifying that fence.\u201d[186]/nWith respect to his and others\u2019 efforts to shift towards the idea and the reality of functional collaboration, which requires some form of communal implementation, McShane knew it would be a form of learning by doing. Since the needed division of labor is not continuous with much of current academic practice, he expected that the adventure[187] in the decades to come would be so-so at best. It was for this reason that McShane would quip: \u201cIf a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly.\u201d[188] He had a leading role in organizing various \u201cdoings,\u201d one of them an international conference in 2014 that resulted in the publication of a volume of essays[189] in which each of the twelve authors implemented the same four-part structure: Context, Content, Hand-On, and Final Reflections. He wrote the following evaluation of the volume of essays published in 2016:/nWe stumbled away, as best we could, from the ethos of academic disciplines. We pretended to be \u201cat the level of the times,\u201d\u2020 as any wise doctorate student does in a doctorate thesis. But none of us were. Further, part of the paradox of luminosity and adult growth is that elder members of our group were regularly better tuned to \u201call that is lacking\u201d\u2020\u2020 than younger members. I, then, more than others, knew what a shabby shot we were having at getting the show on the road.[190]/nTwo years later, McShane participated in a round table discussion of Method in Theology at the West Coast Methods Institute at Loyola Marymount University. In preparation for the conference, McShane had written an essay proposing a paradigm for panel discussions, what he called \u201ca full heuristic paradigm.\u201d[191] He submitted his essay to Method: Journal of Lonergan Studies, which had previously published five of his essays.[192] The referee's report sent to him was succinct and did not recommend publishing the essay, as those \"involved in 'Lonergan studies' need insights as much if not more than prophetic exhortations.\"[193] In his reply to the co-editor of the journal, McShane did not take issue with the use of the word prophetic to describe his essay, but he underscored that prior to Lonergan's discovery of the dynamics of functional collaboration in 1965, he had \u201cclearly shifted the norms of the usual trivial comparison-work to the control of a genetic sequence of prior efforts to understanding whatever.\u201d[194] The rejection of McShane's essay for publication inspired him to write the series of essays Public Challenging the Method Board.[195]/nFrom time to time, McShane described his own efforts as \u201crandom dialectics,\u201d so not the structured encounter that he wrote about at length and only experienced in the \u201cproto-dialectic\u201d[196] exercises in the last year of his life. Over the years, he invited colleagues to step forth and indicate publicly where and how he had gone astray reading Insight and Method in Theology. The response was what he called \u201cdisgusting non-scientific silence.\u201d[197]/nWhile McShane admitted having benefitted from a certain kind of luck in his education, he also realized that some of his works were simply \u201ctoo far out\u201d and did not expect to see much success in his lifetime.[198] Most contemporaries in philosophy and theology had not worked with Markov tensors or thought to use Greek symbols to imagine the longitude and latitude of Luther or Descartes on an expanding globe of meaning./n\"Toynbee's A Study of History can be regarded as an attempt at a great Markovian reduction of the historical process to a very few variables and very large subdivisions and the consequent description of the process by a multiple Markov tensor of manageable rank.\u201d\u2020 My own imaging shifts this tensor into an earth-sphere expanding out along a radial axis t\u2014this helps to glimpse\u2014think longitude and latitude for \u03b8 and \u03a6\u2014my meaning of \u03b8\u03a6T. Think of the \u03b8\u03a6T weave of pairs like Antioch and Alexandria, Luther and Lainez, Descartes and Dilthey, whatever.[199]/nMcShane's long-term optimism regarding the emergence of a creative minority caring for the globe was and is consistent with the worldview \"emergent probability,\" which was the focus of his doctoral thesis. In the Preface to the 2nd edition of the book version of his thesis, which McShane wrote in the fall of 2012, he cited a long passage from Insight where Lonergan wrote that the possibility of a recurrence scheme beginning to function shifts from a product of fractions to their sum when any one of the events (A or B or C or ...) of the scheme occurs.[200] He concluded the Preface with these words: \"The cyclically-summed actualities can, over millennia, shift from Poisson distribution to a Normal and normative law, giving supreme plausibility to a Tower of Able of serious intimate\u2020 understanding grounding, literally, a plain plane of radiant life in the next million years.\"[201]", "9031833": "Cheryl Elisabeth Praeger AC FAA  (born 7 September 1948, Toowoomba, Queensland) is an Australian mathematician.

She is best known for her works in group theory, algebraic graph theory and combinatorial designs./nPraeger completed her high school education at Brisbane Girls Grammar School. After graduating high school, Praeger went to the government vocational guidance section to inquire about how she could further study mathematics. The vocational guidance officer she spoke with tried to discourage her from studying mathematics further,[1] suggesting she become a teacher or a nurse because two other girls who came to him wanting to study maths were not able to pass their courses.[1] He reluctantly showed her an engineering course description, but she felt it did not have enough mathematics. So she left without getting much information that day, but did continue on to receive her bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Queensland./nHaving met several women on the mathematics staff during her undergraduate studies, the prospect of becoming a mathematician did not seem strange to her. During her first and second years she did honours studies in mathematics and physics, choosing to continue in mathematics after her second year.[1] After completing her education at University of Queensland she was offered a research scholarship at Australian National University (ANU) but chose instead to take the Commonwealth Scholarship to the University of Oxford and attended St Anne's College.

The concept of Du Val singularity of an algebraic surface is named after him./nDu Val was born in Cheadle Hulme, Cheshire. He was the son of a cabinet maker, but his parents' marriage broke up. As a child, he suffered ill-health, in particular asthma, and was educated mostly by his mother. He was awarded a first class honours degree from the University of London External Programme in 1926, which he took by correspondence course./nHe was a talented linguist, for example teaching himself Norwegian so that he might read Peer Gynt. He also had a strong interest in history but his love of mathematics led him to pursue that as a career.  His earliest publications show a leaning towards applied mathematics./nHis mother moved to a village near Cambridge and he became acquainted with Henry Baker, Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry. Baker turned his interest towards algebraic geometry, and he entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1927./nDu Val's early work before becoming a research student was on relativity, including a paper on the De Sitter model of the universe and Grassmann's tensor calculus.  His doctorate was on algebraic geometry and in his thesis he generalised a result of Schoute. He worked on algebraic surfaces and later in his career became interested in elliptic functions./nHe received his Ph.D. with a thesis entitled 'On Certain Configurations of Algebraic Geometry Having Groups of Self-Transformations Representable by Symmetry Groups of Certain Polygons' under Baker's supervision in 1930. While a research student he had many famous geometers including Hodge as fellow research students,  and he formed a particular friendship with Coxeter and Semple.  He was elected a fellow of Trinity in 1930 for four years. During that time he travelled extensively, visiting Rome and working with Federigo Enriques, then in 1934 Princeton University, where he attended lectures by James W. Alexander, Luther P. Eisenhart, Solomon Lefschetz, Oswald Veblen, Joseph Wedderburn, and Hermann Weyl./nIn 1936, Du Val took up an assistant lectureship in the Mathematics Department at Manchester, where he stayed for five years.  He was then funded by a British Council scheme to go to Istanbul University as a professor of pure mathematics. There he learnt Turkish and even wrote a book on coordinate geometry in that language./nAfter a spell in the United States at the University of Georgia, he returned to the United Kingdom, first taking up a post in Bristol, then at the University College London in 1954, where he remained until he retired in 1970. Together with Semple he led the London Geometry Seminar during the time he spent in London./nDu Val had three children.[citation needed]/nAfter retirement, Du Val returned to Istanbul.  For three years he held the same post as before, and then as if reversing history, settled down to a retirement in Cambridge./nHe is remembered as an interesting character. For example, in Manchester during the war he was remembered as a cloaked figure striding the parapets, as he carried out his duties as a fire warden.

Shen was a master in many fields of study including mathematics, optics, and horology. In his career as a civil servant, he became a finance minister, governmental state inspector, head official for the Bureau of Astronomy in the Song court, Assistant Minister of Imperial Hospitality, and also served as an academic chancellor.[2] At court his political allegiance was to the Reformist faction known as the New Policies Group, headed by Chancellor Wang Anshi (1021\u20131085)./nIn his Dream Pool Essays or Dream Torrent Essays[3] (\u5922\u6eaa\u7b46\u8ac7; Mengxi Bitan) of 1088, Shen was the first to describe the magnetic needle compass, which would be used for navigation (first described in Europe by Alexander Neckam in 1187).[4][5] Shen discovered the concept of true north in terms of magnetic declination towards the north pole,[5] with experimentation of suspended magnetic needles and \"the improved meridian determined by Shen's [astronomical] measurement of the distance between the pole star and true north\".[6] This was the decisive step in human history to make compasses more useful for navigation, and may have been a concept unknown in Europe for another four hundred years (evidence of German sundials made circa 1450 show markings similar to Chinese geomancers' compasses in regard to declination).[7]/nAlongside his colleague Wei Pu, Shen planned to map the orbital paths of the Moon and the planets in an intensive five-year project involving daily observations, yet this was thwarted by political opponents at court.[8] To aid his work in astronomy, Shen Kuo made improved designs of the armillary sphere, gnomon, sighting tube, and invented a new type of inflow water clock. Shen Kuo devised a geological hypothesis for land formation (geomorphology), based upon findings of inland marine fossils, knowledge of soil erosion, and the deposition of silt.[9] He also proposed a hypothesis of gradual climate change, after observing ancient petrified bamboos that were preserved underground in a dry northern habitat that would not support bamboo growth in his time. He was the first literary figure in China to mention the use of the drydock to repair boats suspended out of water, and also wrote of the effectiveness of the relatively new invention of the canal pound lock. Although not the first to invent camera obscura, Shen noted the relation of the focal point of a concave mirror and that of the pinhole. Shen wrote extensively about movable type printing invented by Bi Sheng (990\u20131051), and because of his written works the legacy of Bi Sheng and the modern understanding of the earliest movable type has been handed down to later generations.[10] Following an old tradition in China, Shen created a raised-relief map while inspecting borderlands. His description of an ancient crossbow mechanism he unearthed as an amateur archaeologist proved to be a Jacob's staff, a surveying tool which wasn't known in Europe until described by Levi ben Gerson in 1321./nShen Kuo wrote several other books besides the Dream Pool Essays, yet much of the writing in his other books has not survived. Some of Shen's poetry was preserved in posthumous written works. Although much of his focus was on technical and scientific issues, he had an interest in divination and the supernatural, the latter including his vivid description of unidentified flying objects from eyewitness testimony. He also wrote commentary on ancient Daoist and Confucian texts./nShen Kuo was born in Qiantang (modern-day Hangzhou) in the year 1031. His father Shen Zhou (\u6c88\u5468; 978\u20131052) was a somewhat lower-class gentry figure serving in official posts on the provincial level; his mother was from a family of equal status in Suzhou, with her maiden name being Xu (\u8a31).[11] Shen Kuo received his initial childhood education from his mother, which was a common practice in China during this period.[11][a] She was very educated herself, teaching Kuo and his brother Pi (\u62ab) the military doctrines of her own elder brother Xu Dong (\u8a31\u6d1e; 975\u20131016).[11] Since Shen was unable to boast of a prominent familial clan history like many of his elite peers born in the north, he was forced to rely on his wit and stern determination to achieve in his studies, subsequently passing the imperial examinations and enter the challenging and sophisticated life of an exam-drafted state bureaucrat.[11]/nFrom about 1040 AD, Shen's family moved around Sichuan province and finally to the international seaport at Xiamen, where Shen's father accepted minor provincial posts in each new location.[12] Shen Zhou also served several years in the prestigious capital judiciary, the equivalent of a national supreme court.[11] Shen Kuo took notice of the various towns and rural features of China as his family traveled, while he became interested during his youth in the diverse topography of the land.[12] He also observed the intriguing aspects of his father's engagement in administrative governance and the managerial problems involved; these experiences had a deep impact on him as he later became a government official.[12] Since he often became ill as a child, Shen Kuo also developed a natural curiosity about medicine and pharmaceutics.[12]/nShen Zhou died in the late winter of 1051 (or early 1052), when his son Shen Kuo was 21 years old. Shen Kuo grieved for his father, and following Confucian ethics, remained inactive in a state of mourning for three years until 1054 (or early 1055).[13] As of 1054, Shen began serving in minor local governmental posts. However, his natural abilities to plan, organize, and design were proven early in life; one example is his design and supervision of the hydraulic drainage of an embankment system, which converted some one hundred thousand acres (400\u00a0km2) of swampland into prime farmland.[13] Shen Kuo noted that the success of the silt fertilization method relied upon the effective operation of sluice gates of irrigation canals.[14]/nIn 1063 Shen Kuo successfully passed the imperial examinations, the difficult national-level standard test that every high official was required to pass in order to enter the governmental system.[13] He not only passed the exam however, but was placed into the higher category of the best and brightest students.[13] While serving at Yangzhou, Shen's brilliance and dutiful character caught the attention of Zhang Chu (\u5f35\u84ad; 1015\u20131080), the Fiscal Intendant of the region. Shen made a lasting impression upon Zhang, who recommended Shen for a court appointment in the financial administration of the central court.[13] Shen would also eventually marry Zhang's daughter, who became his second wife./nIn his career as a scholar-official for the central government, Shen Kuo was also an ambassador to the Western Xia dynasty and Liao dynasty,[15] a military commander, a director of hydraulic works, and the leading chancellor of the Hanlin Academy.[16] By 1072, Shen was appointed as the head official of the Bureau of Astronomy.[13] With his leadership position in the bureau, Shen was responsible for projects in improving calendrical science,[10] and proposed many reforms to the Chinese calendar alongside the work of his colleague Wei Pu.[8] With his impressive skills and aptitude for matters of economy and finance, Shen was appointed as the Finance Commissioner at the central court.[17]/nAs written by Li Zhiyi, a man married to Hu Wenrou (granddaughter of Hu Su, a famous minister of the Song dynasty), Shen Kuo was Li's mentor while Shen served as an official.[18] According to Li's epitaph for his wife, Shen would sometimes relay questions via Li to Hu when he needed clarification for his mathematical work, as Hu Wenrou was esteemed by Shen as a remarkable female mathematician.[18] Shen lamented: \"If only she were a man, Wenrou would be my friend.\"[18]/nWhile employed by the central government, Shen Kuo was also sent out with others to inspect the granary system of the empire, investigating problems of illegal tax-collection, negligence, ineffective disaster relief, and inadequate water-conservancy projects.[19] While Shen was appointed as the regional inspector of Zhejiang in 1073, the Emperor requested that Shen pay a visit to the famous poet Su Shi (1037\u20131101), then an administrator in Hangzhou.[20] Shen took advantage of this meeting to copy some of Su's poetry, which he presented to the Emperor indicating that it expressed \"abusive and hateful\" speech against the Song court; these poems were later politicized by Li Ding and Shu Dan in order to level a court case against Su. (The Crow Terrace Poetry Trial, of 1079.)[20] With his demonstrations of loyalty and ability, Shen Kuo was awarded the honorary title of a State Foundation Viscount by Emperor Shenzong of Song (r. 1067\u20131085), who placed a great amount of trust in Shen Kuo.[17] He was even made 'companion to the heir apparent' (\u592a\u5b50\u4e2d\u5141; 'Taizi zhongyun').[1]/nAt court Shen was a political favorite of the Chancellor Wang Anshi (1021\u20131086), who was the leader of the political faction of Reformers, also known as the New Policies Group (\u65b0\u6cd5, Xin Fa).[21][b] Shen Kuo had a previous history with Wang Anshi, since it was Wang who had composed the funerary epitaph for Shen's father, Zhou.[22] Shen Kuo soon impressed Wang Anshi with his skills and abilities as an administrator and government agent. In 1072, Shen was sent to supervise Wang's program of surveying the building of silt deposits in the Bian Canal outside the capital city. Using an original technique, Shen successfully dredged the canal and demonstrated the formidable value of the silt gathered as a fertilizer.[22] He gained further reputation at court once he was dispatched as an envoy to the Khitan Liao dynasty in the summer of 1075.[22] The Khitans had made several aggressive negotiations of pushing their borders south, while manipulating several incompetent Song ambassadors who conceded to the Liao Kingdom's demands.[22] In a brilliant display of diplomacy, Shen Kuo came to the camp of the Khitan monarch at Mt. Yongan (near modern Pingquan, Hebei), armed with copies of previously archived diplomatic negotiations between the Song and Liao dynasties.[22] Shen Kuo refuted Emperor Daozong's bluffs point for point, while the Song reestablished their rightful border line.[22] In regard to the L\u00fd dynasty of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t (in modern northern Vietnam), Shen demonstrated in his Dream Pool Essays that he was familiar with the key players (on the Vietnamese side) in the prelude to the Sino-Vietnamese War of 1075\u20131077.[23] With his reputable achievements, Shen became a trusted member of Wang Anshi's elite circle of eighteen unofficial core political loyalists to the New Policies Group.[22]/nAlthough much of Wang Anshi's reforms outlined in the New Policies centered on state finance, land tax reform, and the Imperial examinations, there were also military concerns. This included policies of raising militias to lessen the expense of upholding a million soldiers,[24] putting government monopolies on saltpetre and sulphur production and distribution in 1076 (to ensure that gunpowder solutions would not fall into the hands of enemies),[25][26] and aggressive military policy towards Song's northern rivals of the Western Xia and Liao dynasties.[27] A few years after Song dynasty military forces had made victorious territorial gains against the Tanguts of the Western Xia, in 1080 Shen Kuo was entrusted as a military officer in defense of Yanzhou (modern-day Yan'an, Shaanxi province).[28] During the autumn months of 1081, Shen was successful in defending Song dynasty territory while capturing several fortified towns of the Western Xia.[17] The Emperor Shenzong of Song rewarded Shen with numerous titles for his merit in these battles, and in the sixteen months of Shen's military campaign, he received 273 letters from the Emperor.[17] However, Emperor Shenzong trusted an arrogant military officer who disobeyed the emperor and Shen's proposal for strategic fortifications, instead fortifying what Shen considered useless strategic locations. Furthermore, this officer expelled Shen from his commanding post at the main citadel, so as to deny him any glory in chance of victory.[17] The result of this was nearly catastrophic, as the forces of the arrogant officer were decimated;[17] Xinzhong Yao states that the death toll was 60,000.[1] Nonetheless, Shen was successful in defending his fortifications and the only possible Tangut invasion-route to Yanzhou.[17]/nThe new Chancellor Cai Que (\u8521\u78ba; 1036\u20131093) held Shen responsible for the disaster and loss of life.[17] Along with abandoning the territory which Shen Kuo had fought for, Cai ousted Shen from his seat of office.[17] Shen's life was now forever changed, as he lost his once reputable career in state governance and the military.[17] Shen was then put under probation in a fixed residence for the next six years. However, as he was isolated from governance, he decided to pick up the ink brush and dedicate himself to intensive scholarly studies. After completing two geographical atlases for a state-sponsored program, Shen was rewarded by having his sentence of probation lifted, allowing him to live in a place of his choice.[17] Shen was also pardoned by the court for any previous faults or crimes that were claimed against him.[17]/nIn his more idle years removed from court affairs, Shen Kuo enjoyed pastimes of the Chinese gentry and literati that would indicate his intellectual level and cultural taste to others.[30] As described in his Dream Pool Essays, Shen Kuo enjoyed the company of the \"nine guests\" (\u4e5d\u5ba2, jiuke), a figure of speech for the Chinese zither, the older 17x17 line variant of weiqi (known today as go), Zen Buddhist meditation, ink (calligraphy and painting), tea drinking, alchemy, chanting poetry, conversation, and drinking wine.[29] These nine activities were an extension to the older so-called Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar./nIn the 1070s, Shen had purchased a lavish garden estate on the outskirts of modern-day Zhenjiang, Jiangsu province, a place of great beauty which he named \"Dream Brook\" (\"Mengxi\") after he visited it for the first time in 1086.[17] Shen Kuo permanently moved to the Dream Brook Estate in 1088, and in that same year he completed his life's written work of the Dream Pool Essays, naming the book after his garden-estate property. It was there that Shen Kuo spent the last several years of his life in leisure, isolation, and illness, until his death in 1095.[17]/nShen Kuo wrote extensively on a wide range of different subjects. His written work included two geographical atlases, a treatise on music with mathematical harmonics, governmental administration, mathematical astronomy, astronomical instruments, martial defensive tactics and fortifications, painting, tea, medicine, and much poetry.[31] His scientific writings have been praised by sinologists such as Joseph Needham and Nathan Sivin, and he has been compared by Sivin to polymaths such as his Song dynasty Chinese contemporary Su Song, as well as to Gottfried Leibniz and Mikhail Lomonosov.[32]/nJoseph Needham suggests that certain pottery vessels of the Han dynasty (202 BC \u2013 220 AD) showing artificial mountains as lid decorations may have influenced the development of the raised-relief map in China.[33] The Han dynasty general Ma Yuan (14 BC \u2013 49 AD) is recorded as having made a raised-relief map of valleys and mountains in a rice-constructed model of 32 AD.[34] Shen Kuo's largest atlas included twenty three maps of China and foreign regions that were drawn at a uniform scale of 1:900,000.[6] Shen also created a raised-relief map using sawdust, wood, beeswax, and wheat paste.[6][35] Zhu Xi (1130\u20131200) was inspired by the raised-relief map of Huang Shang and so made his own portable map made of wood and clay which could be folded up from eight hinged pieces.[36]/nFor pharmacology, Shen wrote of the difficulties of adequate diagnosis and therapy, as well as the proper selection, preparation, and administration of drugs.[37] He held great concern for detail and philological accuracy in identification, use and cultivation of different types of medicinal herbs, such as in which months medicinal plants should be gathered, their exact ripening times, which parts should be used for therapy; for domesticated herbs he wrote about planting times, fertilization, and other matters of horticulture.[38] In the realms of botany, zoology, and mineralogy, Shen Kuo documented and systematically described hundreds of different plants, agricultural crops, rare vegetation, animals, and minerals found in China.[39][40][41][42] For example, Shen noted that the mineral orpiment was used to quickly erase writing errors on paper.[43]/nThe writing of Shen Kuo is the only source for the date when the drydock was first used in China.[44] Shen Kuo wrote that during the Xi-Ning reign (1068\u20131077), the court official Huang Huaixin devised a plan for repairing 60\u00a0m (200\u00a0ft) long palatial boats that were a century old; essentially, Huang Huaixin devised the first Chinese drydock for suspending boats out of water.[44] These boats were then placed in a roof-covered dock warehouse to protect them from weathering.[44] Shen also wrote about the effectiveness of the new invention (i.e. by the 10th century engineer Qiao Weiyo) of the pound lock to replace the old flash lock design used in canals.[45] He wrote that it saved the work of five hundred annual labors, annual costs of up to 1,250,000 strings of cash, and increased the size limit of boats accommodated from 21 tons/21000 kg to 113 tons/115000 kg.[45]/nIf it were not for Shen Kuo's analysis and quoting in his Dream Pool Essays of the writings of the architect Yu Hao (fl. 970), the latter's work would have been lost to history.[46][c] Yu designed a famous wooden pagoda that burned down in 1044 and was replaced in 1049 by a brick pagoda (the 'Iron Pagoda') of similar height, but not of his design. From Shen's quotation\u2014or perhaps Shen's own paraphrasing of Yu Hao's Timberwork Manual (\u6728\u7d93; Mujing)\u2014shows that already in the 10th century there was a graded system of building unit proportions, a system which Shen states had become more precise in his time but stating no one could possibly reproduce such a sound work.[47][48] However, he did not anticipate the more complex and matured system of unit proportions embodied in the extensive written work by scholar-official Li Jie (1065\u20131110), the Treatise on Architectural Methods (\u71df\u9020\u6cd5\u5f0f; Yingzao Fashi) of 1103.[48][49] Klaas Ruitenbeek states that the version of the Timberwork Manual quoted by Shen is most likely Shen's summarization of Yu's work or a corrupted passage of the original by Yu Hao, as Shen writes: \"According to some, the work was written by Yu Hao.\"[47]/nThe Chinese had long taken an interest in examining the human body. For example, in 16 AD, the Xin dynasty usurper Wang Mang called for the dissection of an executed man, to examine his arteries and viscera in order to discover cures for illnesses.[50] Shen also took interest in human anatomy, dispelling the long-held Chinese theory that the throat contained three valves, writing, \"When liquid and solid are imbibed together, how can it be that in one's mouth they sort themselves into two throat channels?\"[38] Shen maintained that the larynx was the beginning of a system that distributed vital qi from the air throughout the body, and that the esophagus was a simple tube that dropped food into the stomach.[51] Following Shen's reasoning and correcting the findings of the dissection of executed bandits in 1045, an early 12th-century Chinese account of a bodily dissection finally supported Shen's belief in two throat valves, not three.[52] Also, the later Song dynasty judge and early forensic expert Song Ci (1186\u20131249) would promote the use of autopsy in order to solve homicide cases, as written in his Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified.[53]/nIn the broad field of mathematics, Shen Kuo mastered many practical mathematical problems, including many complex formulas for geometry,[54] circle packing,[55] and chords and arcs problems employing trigonometry.[56] Shen addressed problems of writing out very large numbers, as large as (104)43.[57] Shen's \"technique of small increments\" laid the foundation in Chinese mathematics for packing problems involving equal difference series.[57] Sal Restivo writes that Shen used summation of higher series to ascertain the number of kegs which could be piled in layers in a space shaped like the frustum of a rectangular pyramid.[58][59] In his formula \"technique of intersecting circles\", he created an approximation of the arc of a circle s given the diameter d, sagitta v, and length of the chord c subtending the arc, the length of which he approximated as s = c + 2v2/d.[57] Restivo writes that Shen's work in the lengths of arcs of circles provided the basis for spherical trigonometry developed in the 13th century by Guo Shoujing (1231\u20131316).[58] He also simplified the counting rods technique by outlining short cuts in algorithm procedures used on the counting board, an idea expanded on by the mathematician Yang Hui (1238\u20131298).[60] Victor J. Katz asserts that Shen's method of \"dividing by 9, increase by 1; dividing by 8, increase by 2,\" was a direct forerunner to the rhyme scheme method of repeated addition \"9, 1, bottom add 1; 9, 2, bottom add 2\".[61]/nShen wrote extensively about what he had learned while working for the state treasury, including mathematical problems posed by computing land tax, estimating requirements, currency issues, metrology, and so forth.[62] Shen once computed the amount of terrain space required for battle formations in military strategy,[63] and also computed the longest possible military campaign given the limits of human carriers who would bring their own food and food for other soldiers.[64] Shen wrote about the earlier Yi Xing (672\u2013717), a Buddhist monk who applied an early escapement mechanism to a water-powered celestial globe.[65] By using mathematical permutations, Shen described Yi Xing's calculation of possible positions on a go board game. Shen calculated the total number for this using up to five rows and twenty five game pieces, which yielded the number 847,288,609,443.[66][67]/nShen Kuo experimented with the pinhole camera and burning mirror as the ancient Chinese Mohists had done in the 4th century BC, as Mozi of China's Warring States period was perhaps the first to describe the concept of camera obscura, if not his Greek contemporary Aristotle.[68] The Iraqi Muslim scientist Ibn al-Haytham (965\u20131039) further experimented with camera obscura and was the first to attribute geometrical and quantitative properties to it, but Shen was first to note the relationship of the three separate radiation phenomena: the focal point, burning point, and pinhole.[69] Using a fitting metaphor, Shen compared optical image inversion to an oarlock and waisted drum.[70] Along with focal points, he also noted that the image in a concave mirror is inverted.[71] Shen, who never asserted that he was the first to experiment with camera obscura, hints in his writing that camera obscura was dealt with in the Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang written by Duan Chengshi (d. 863) during the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907), in regard to the inverted image of a Chinese pagoda by a seashore.[72] Chinese authors from the 12th to 17th centuries would discuss the optical observations made by Shen Kuo but not advance them further, while Leonardo da Vinci (1452\u20131519) would be the first in Europe to make a similar observation about the focal point and pinhole in camera obscura.[69]/nSince the time of the engineer and inventor Ma Jun (c. 200\u2013265), the Chinese had used the south-pointing chariot, which did not employ magnetism, as a compass. In 1044 the Collection of the Most Important Military Techniques (\u6b66\u7d93\u7e3d\u8981; Wujing Zongyao) recorded that fish-shaped objects cut from sheet iron, magnetized by thermoremanence (essentially, heating that produced weak magnetic force), and placed in a water-filled bowl enclosed by a box were used for directional pathfinding alongside the south-pointing chariot.[73][74]/nHowever, it was not until the time of Shen Kuo that the earliest magnetic compasses would be used for navigation. In his written work, Shen Kuo made the first known explicit reference to the magnetic compass-needle and the concept of true north.[16][75][76] He wrote that steel needles were magnetized once they were rubbed with lodestone, and that they were put in floating position or in mountings; he described the suspended compass as the best form to be used, and noted that the magnetic needle of compasses pointed either south or north.[73][77] Shen Kuo asserted that the needle will point south but with a deviation,[77] stating \"[the magnetic needles] are always displaced slightly east rather than pointing due south.\"[73]/nShen Kuo wrote that it was preferable to use the twenty-four-point rose instead of the old eight compass cardinal points \u2014 and the former was recorded in use for navigation shortly after Shen's death.[6] The preference of use for the twenty-four-point-rose compass may have arisen from Shen's finding of a more accurate astronomical meridian, determined by his measurement between the pole star and true north;[6] however, it could also have been inspired by geomantic beliefs and practices.[6] The book of the author Zhu Yu, the Pingzhou Table Talks published in 1119 (written from 1111 to 1117), was the first record of use of a compass for seafaring navigation.[76][78] However, Zhu Yu's book recounts events back to 1086, when Shen Kuo was writing the Dream Pool Essays; this meant that in Shen's time the compass might have already been in navigational use.[78] In any case, Shen Kuo's writing on magnetic compasses has proved invaluable for understanding China's earliest use of the compass for seafaring navigation./nMany of Shen Kuo's contemporaries were interested in antiquarian pursuits of collecting old artworks.[80] They were also interested in archaeological pursuits, although for rather different reasons than why Shen Kuo held an interest in archaeology. While Shen's educated Confucian contemporaries were interested in obtaining ancient relics and antiques in order to revive their use in rituals, Shen was more concerned with how items from archeological finds were originally manufactured and what their functionality would have been, based on empirical evidence.[81] Shen Kuo criticized those in his day who reconstructed ancient ritual objects using only their imagination and not the tangible evidence from archeological digs or finds.[81] Shen also disdained the notion of others that these objects were products of the \"sages\" or the aristocratic class of antiquity, rightfully crediting the items' manufacture and production to the common working people and artisans of previous eras.[81] Some author writes that Shen Kuo \"advocated the use of an interdisciplinary approach to archaeology and practiced such an approach himself through his work in metallurgy, optics, and geometry in the study of ancient measures.\"[81]/nWhile working in the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo's interest in archaeology and old relics led him to reconstruct an armillary sphere from existing models as well as from ancient texts that could provide additional information.[81] Shen used ancient mirrors while conducting his optics experiments.[81] He observed ancient weaponry, describing the scaled sight devices on ancient crossbows and the ancients' production of swords with composite blades that had a midrib of wrought iron and low-carbon steel while having two sharp edges of high-carbon steel.[81] Being a knowledgeable musician, Shen also suggested suspending an ancient bell by using a hollow handle.[81] In his assessment of the carved reliefs of the ancient Zhuwei Tomb, Shen stated that the reliefs demonstrate genuine Han dynasty era clothing.[82]/nAfter unearthing an ancient crossbow device from a house's garden in Haichow, Jiangsu, Shen discovered that the cross-wire grid sighting device, marked in graduated measurements on the stock, could be used to calculate the height of a distant mountain in the same way that mathematicians could apply right-angle triangles to measure height.[83] Needham asserts Shen had discovered the survey device known as Jacob's staff, which was not described elsewhere until the Proven\u00e7al Jewish mathematician Levi ben Gerson (1288\u20131344) wrote of it in 1321.[84] Shen wrote that while viewing the whole of a mountain, the distance on the instrument was long, but while viewing a small part of the mountainside the distance was short due to the device's cross piece that had to be pushed further away from the observer's eye, with the graduation starting on the further end.[83] He wrote that if one placed an arrow on the device and looked past its end, the degree of the mountain could be measured and thus its height could be calculated.[83]/nThe ancient Greek Aristotle (384 BC\u2013322 BC) wrote in his Meteorology of how the earth had the potential for physical change, including the belief that all rivers and seas at one time did not exist where they were, and were dry. The Greek writer Xenophanes (570 BC\u2013480 BC) wrote of how inland marine fossils were evidence that massive periodic flooding had wiped out mankind several times in the past, but never wrote of land formation or shifting seashores.[85] Du Yu (222\u2013285) a Chinese Jin dynasty officer, believed that the land of hills would eventually be leveled into valleys and valleys would gradually rise to form hills.[86] The Daoist alchemist Ge Hong (284\u2013364) wrote of the legendary immortal Magu; in a written dialogue by Ge, Ma Gu described how what was once the Eastern Sea (i.e. East China Sea) had transformed into solid land where mulberry trees grew, and would one day be filled with mountains and dry, dusty lands.[87] The later Persian Muslim scholar Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b (973\u20131048) hypothesized that India was once covered by the Indian Ocean while observing rock formations at the mouths of rivers.[88]/nIt was Shen Kuo who formulated a hypothesis about the process of land formation (geomorphology) based upon several observations as evidence. This included his observation of fossil shells in a geological stratum of a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean. He inferred that the land was reshaped and formed by erosion of the mountains, uplift, and the deposition of silt, after observing strange natural erosions of the Taihang Mountains and the Yandang Mountain near Wenzhou.[89] He hypothesized that, with the inundation of silt, the land of the continent must have been formed over an enormous span of time.[90] While visiting the Taihang Mountains in 1074, Shen Kuo noticed strata of bivalve shells and ovoid rocks in a horizontal-running span through a cliff like a large belt.[90] Shen proposed that the cliff was once the location of an ancient seashore that by his time had shifted hundreds of miles east.[90] Shen wrote that in the Zhiping reign period (1064\u20131067) a man of Zezhou unearthed an object in his garden that looked like a serpent or dragon, and after examining it, concluded the dead animal had apparently turned to \"stone\".[91][92] The magistrate of Jincheng, Zheng Boshun, examined the creature as well, and noted the same scale-like markings that were seen on other marine animals.[91][92] Shen Kuo likened this to the \"stone crabs\" found in China.[91][92]/nShen also wrote that since petrified bamboos were found underground in a climatic area where they had never been known to be grown, the climate there must have shifted geographically over time.[93] Around the year 1080, Shen Kuo noted that a landslide on the bank of a large river near Yanzhou (modern Yan'an) had revealed an open space several dozens of feet under the ground once the bank collapsed.[93] This underground space contained hundreds of petrified bamboos still intact with roots and trunks, \"all turned to stone\" as Shen Kuo wrote.[93] Shen Kuo noted that bamboos do not grow in Yanzhou, located in northern China, and he was puzzled during which previous dynasty the bamboos could have grown.[93] Considering that damp and gloomy low places provide suitable conditions for the growth of bamboo, Shen deduced that the climate of Yanzhou must have fit that description in very ancient times.[93] Although this would have intrigued many of his readers, the study of paleoclimatology in medieval China did not develop into an established discipline.[93]/nThe Song dynasty philosopher Zhu Xi (1130\u20131200) wrote of this curious natural phenomenon of fossils as well. He was known to have read the works of Shen Kuo.[92] Shen's description of soil erosion and weathering predated that of Georgius Agricola in his book of 1546, De veteribus et novis metallis.[94] Furthermore, Shen's theory of sedimentary deposition predated that of James Hutton, whose groundbreaking work was published in 1802 (considered the foundation of modern geology).[94] Historian Joseph Needham likened Shen's account to that of the Scottish scientist Roderick Murchison (1792\u20131871), who was inspired to become a geologist after observing a providential landslide.[94]/nEarly speculation and hypothesis pertaining to what is now known as meteorology had a long tradition in China before Shen Kuo. For example, the Han dynasty scholar Wang Chong (27\u201397) accurately described the process of the water cycle.[95] However, Shen made some observations that were not found elsewhere in Chinese literature. For instance, Shen was the first in East Asia to describe tornadoes, which were thought to exist only in the Western hemisphere until their observation in China during the first decade of the 20th century.[96]/nShen gave reasoning (earlier proposed by Sun Sikong, 1015\u20131076) that rainbows were formed by the shadow of the sun in rain, occurring when the sun would shine upon it.[97][98][99] Paul Dong writes that Shen's explanation of the rainbow as a phenomenon of atmospheric refraction \"is basically in accord with modern scientific principles.\"[100] In Europe, Roger Bacon (1214\u20131294) was the first to suggest that the colors of the rainbow were caused by the reflection and refraction of sunlight through rain drops.[71]/nShen hypothesized that rays of sunlight refract before reaching the surface of the earth, hence people on earth observing the sun are not viewing it in its exact position, in other words, the altitude of the apparent sun is higher than the actual altitude of the sun.[100] Dong writes that \"at the time, this discovery was remarkably original.\"[100] Ibn al-Haytham, in his Book of Optics (1021), also discussed atmospheric refraction in regard to twilight.[71]/nBeing the head official for the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo was an avid scholar of medieval astronomy, and improved the designs of several astronomical instruments. Shen is credited with making improved designs of the gnomon, armillary sphere, and clepsydra clock.[101] For the clepsydra he designed a new overflow-tank type, and argued for a more efficient higher-order interpolation instead of linear interpolation in calibrating the measure of time.[101] Improving the 5th century model of the astronomical sighting tube, Shen Kuo widened its diameter so that the new calibration could observe the pole star indefinitely.[101] This came about due to the position of the pole star shifting in position since the time of Zu Geng in the 5th century, hence Shen Kuo diligently observed the course of the pole star for three months, plotting the data of its course and coming to the conclusion that it had shifted slightly over three degrees.[101] Apparently this astronomical finding had an impact upon the intellectual community in China at the time. Even Shen's political rival and contemporary astronomer Su Song featured Shen's corrected position of the pole star (halfway between Tian shu, at \u2212350 degrees, and the current Polaris) in the fourth star map of his celestial atlas.[102]/nThe astronomical phenomena of the solar eclipse and lunar eclipse had been observed in the 4th century BC by astronomers Gan De and Shi Shen; the latter gave instructions on predicting the eclipses based on the relative position of the Moon to the Sun.[103] The philosopher Wang Chong argued against the 'radiating influence' theory of Jing Fang's writing in the 1st century BC and that of Zhang Heng (78\u2013139); the latter two correctly hypothesized that the brightness of the Moon was merely light reflected from the Sun.[104] Jing Fang had written in the 1st century BC of how it was long accepted in China that the Sun and Moon were spherical in shape ('like a crossbow bullet'), not flat.[105] Shen Kuo also wrote of solar and lunar eclipses in this manner, yet expanded upon this to explain why the celestial bodies were spherical, going against the 'flat earth' theory for celestial bodies.[106] However, there is no evidence to suggest that Shen Kuo supported a round earth theory, which was introduced into Chinese science by Matteo Ricci and Xu Guangqi in the 17th century.[107] When the Director of the Astronomical Observatory asked Shen Kuo if the shapes of the Sun and Moon were round like balls or flat like fans, Shen Kuo explained that celestial bodies were spherical because of knowledge of waxing and waning of the Moon.[106] Much like what Zhang Heng had said, Shen Kuo likened the Moon to a ball of silver, which does not produce light, but simply reflects light if provided from another source (the Sun).[106] He explained that when the Sun's light is slanting, the Moon appears full.[106] He then explained if one were to cover any sort of sphere with white powder, and then viewed from the side it would appear to be a crescent, hence he reasoned that celestial bodies were spherical.[100][106] He also wrote that, although the Sun and Moon were in conjunction and opposition with each other once a month, this did not mean the Sun would be eclipsed every time their paths met, because of the small obliquity of their orbital paths.[106][108]/nShen is also known for his cosmological hypotheses in explaining the variations of planetary motions, including retrogradation.[109] His colleague Wei Pu realized that the old calculation technique for the mean Sun was inaccurate compared to the apparent Sun, since the latter was ahead of it in the accelerated phase of motion, and behind it in the retarded phase.[110] Shen's hypotheses were similar to the concept of the epicycle in the Greco-Roman tradition,[109] only Shen compared the side-section of orbital paths of planets and variations of planetary speeds to points in the tips of a willow leaf.[111][112] In a similar rudimentary physical analogy of celestial motions, as John B. Henderson describes it, Shen likened the relationship of the Moon's path to the ecliptic, the path of the Sun, \"to the figure of a rope coiled about a tree.\"[112]/nAlong with his colleague Wei Pu in the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo planned to plot out the exact coordinates of planetary and lunar movements by recording their astronomical observations three times a night for a continuum of five years.[8] The Song astronomers of Shen's day still retained the lunar theory and coordinates of the earlier Yi Xing, which after 350 years had devolved into a state of considerable error.[8] Shen criticized earlier Chinese astronomers for failing to describe celestial movement in spatial terms, yet he did not attempt to provide any reasoning for the motive power of the planets or other celestial movements.[112] Shen and Wei began astronomical observations for the Moon and planets by plotting their locations three times a night for what should have been five successive years.[8] The officials and astronomers at court were deeply opposed to Wei and Shen's work, offended by their insistence that the coordinates of the renowned Yi Xing were inaccurate.[113] They also slandered Wei Pu, out of resentment that a commoner had expertise exceeding theirs.[114] When Wei and Shen made a public demonstration using the gnomon to prove the doubtful wrong, the other ministers reluctantly agreed to correct the lunar and solar errors.[113][115] Despite this success, they eventually dismissed Wei and Shen's tables of planetary motions.[22] Therefore, only the worst and most obvious planetary errors were corrected, and many inaccuracies remained.[114]/nShen Kuo wrote that during the Qingli reign period (1041\u20131048), under Emperor Renzong of Song (1022\u20131063), an obscure commoner and artisan known as Bi Sheng (990\u20131051) invented ceramic movable type printing.[116][117] Although the use of assembling individual characters to compose a piece of text had its origins in antiquity, Bi Sheng's methodical innovation was something completely revolutionary for his time. Shen Kuo noted that the process was tedious if one only wanted to print a few copies of a book, but if one desired to make hundreds or thousands of copies, the process was incredibly fast and efficient.[116] Beyond Shen Kuo's writing, however, nothing is known of Bi Sheng's life or the influence of movable type in his lifetime.[118] Although the details of Bi Sheng's life were scarcely known, Shen Kuo wrote:/nWhen Bi Sheng died, his fount of type passed into the possession of my followers (i.e. one of Shen's nephews), among whom it has been kept as a precious possession until now.[2][119]/nThere are a few surviving examples of books printed in the late Song dynasty using movable type printing.[120] This includes Zhou Bida's Notes of The Jade Hall (\u7389\u5802\u96dc\u8a18) printed in 1193 using the method of baked-clay movable type characters outlined in the Dream Pool Essays.[121] Yao Shu (1201\u20131278), an advisor to Kublai Khan, once persuaded a disciple Yang Gu to print philological primers and Neo-Confucian texts by using what he termed the \"movable type of Shen Kuo\".[122] Wang Zhen (fl. 1290\u20131333), who wrote the valuable agricultural, scientific, and technological treatise of the Nong Shu, mentioned an alternative method of baking earthenware type with earthenware frames in order to make whole blocks.[122] Wang Zhen also improved its use by inventing wooden movable type in the years 1297 or 1298, while he was a magistrate of Jingde, Anhui province.[123] The earlier Bi Sheng had experimented with wooden movable type,[124] but Wang's main contribution was improving the speed of typesetting with simple mechanical devices, along with the complex, systematic arrangement of wooden movable type involving the use of revolving tables.[125] Although later metal movable type would be used in China, Wang Zhen experimented with tin metal movable type, but found its use to be inefficient.[126]/nBy the 15th century, metal movable type printing was developed in Ming dynasty China (and earlier in Goryeo Korea, by the mid 13th century), and was widely applied in China by at least the 16th century.[127] In Jiangsu and Fujian, wealthy Ming era families sponsored the use of metal type printing (mostly using bronze). This included the printing works of Hua Sui (1439\u20131513), who pioneered the first Chinese bronze-type movable printing in the year 1490.[128] In 1718, during the mid Qing dynasty (1644\u20131912), the scholar of Tai'an known as Xu Zhiding developed movable type with enamelware instead of earthenware.[122] There was also Zhai Jinsheng (b. 1784), a teacher of Jingxian, Anhui, who spent thirty years making a font of earthenware movable type, and by 1844 he had over 100,000 Chinese writing characters in five sizes.[122]/nDespite these advances, movable type printing never gained the amount of widespread use in East Asia that woodblock printing had achieved since the Chinese Tang dynasty in the 9th century. With written Chinese, the vast amount of written morpheme characters impeded movable type's acceptance and practical use, and was therefore seen as largely unsatisfactory.[116] Furthermore, the European printing press, first invented by Johannes Gutenberg (1398\u20131468), was eventually wholly adopted as the standard in China, yet the tradition of woodblock printing remains popular in East Asian countries.[116]/nShen Kuo described the phenomena of natural predator insects controlling the population of pests, the latter of which had the potential to wreak havoc upon the agricultural base of China.[129]/nShen also wrote about advancements in metallurgy. While visiting the iron-producing district at Cizhou in 1075, Shen described the \"partial decarburization\" method of reforging cast iron under a cold blast, which Hartwell, Needham, and Wertime state is the predecessor of the Bessemer process.[130] Shen was worried about deforestation[d] due to the needs of the iron industry and ink makers using pine soot in the production process, so he suggested for the latter an alternative of petroleum, which he believed was \"produced inexhaustibly within the earth\".[97][131] Shen used the soot from the smoke of burned petroleum fuel (\u77f3\u6cb9 Sh\u00edy\u00f3u, \"rock oil\" as Shen called it) to invent a new, more durable type of writing ink; the Ming dynasty pharmacologist Li Shizhen (1518\u20131593) wrote that Shen's ink was \"lustrous like lacquer, and superior to that made from pinewood lamp-black,\" or the soot from pinewood.[132][133]/nShen Kuo was much in favor of philosophical Daoist notions which challenged the authority of empirical science in his day. Although much could be discerned through empirical observation and recorded study, Daoism asserted that the secrets of the universe were boundless, something that scientific investigation could merely express in fragments and partial understandings.[134] Shen Kuo referred to the ancient Daoist I Ching in explaining the spiritual processes and attainment of foreknowledge that cannot be attained through \"crude traces\", which he likens to mathematical astronomy.[134] Nathan Sivin proposes that Shen was the first in history to \"make a clear distinction between our unconnected experiences and the unitary causal world we postulate to explain them,\" which Biderman and Scharfstein state is arguably inherent in the works of Heraclitus, Plato, and Democritus as well.[135] Shen was a firm believer in destiny and prognostication, and made rational explanations for the relations between them.[136] Shen held a special interest in fate, mystical divination, bizarre phenomena, yet warned against the tendency to believe that all matters in life were preordained.[137] When describing an event where lightning had struck a house and all the wooden walls did not burn (but simply turned black) and lacquerwares inside were fine, yet metal objects had melted into liquid, Shen Kuo wrote:/nMost people can only judge of things by the experiences of ordinary life, but phenomena outside the scope of this are really quite numerous. How insecure it is to investigate natural principles using only the light of common knowledge, and subjective ideas.[138]/nIn his commentary on the ancient Confucian philosopher Mencius (372\u2013289 BC), Shen wrote of the importance of choosing to follow what one knew to be a true path, yet the heart and mind could not attain full knowledge of truth through mere sensory experience.[70] In his own unique way but using terms influenced by the ideas of Mencius, Shen wrote of an autonomous inner authority that formed the basis for one's inclination towards moral choices, a concept linked to Shen's life experiences of surviving and obtaining success through self-reliance.[70] Along with his commentary on the Chinese classic texts, Shen Kuo also wrote extensively on the topics of supernatural divination and Buddhist meditation.[139]/nIn the \"Strange Happenings\" passage of the Dream Pool Essays, Shen offered accounts of an unidentified flying object that occurred during the reign of Emperor Renzong (1022\u20131063). An object as bright as a pearl was said to occasionally hover over the city of Yangzhou at night, and was previously described by local inhabitants of eastern Anhui and then in Jiangsu.[140] A man near Xingkai Lake observed the same object, alleging that it emitted powerful lights from its interior like sunbeams illuminating the woods over a ten mile radius before departing at tremendous speeds.[141] Shen recorded that Yibo, a poet of Gaoyou, wrote a poem about this \"pearl\" after witnessing it and that locals around Fanliang in Yangzhou erected a \"Pearl Pavilion\" where spectators on boats hoped to spot the mysterious flying object again.[142]/nAs an art critic, Shen criticized the paintings of Li Cheng (919\u2013967) for failing to observe the principle of \"seeing the small from the viewpoint of the large\" in portraying buildings and the like.[143] He praised the works of Dong Yuan (c. 934\u2013c. 962); he noted that although a close-up view of Dong's work would create the impression that his brush techniques were cursory, seen from afar his landscape paintings would give the impression of grand, resplendent, and realistic scenery.[144][145][146] In addition, Shen's writing on Dong's artworks represents the earliest known reference to the Jiangnan style of painting.[147] In his \"Song on Painting\" and in his Dream Pool Essays, Shen praised the creative artworks of the Tang painter Wang Wei (701\u2013761); Shen noted that Wang was unique in that he \"penetrated into the mysterious reason and depth of creative activity,\" but was criticized by others for not conforming his paintings to reality, such as his painting with a banana tree growing in a snowy, wintry landscape.[148][149][150]/nMuch of Shen Kuo's written work was probably purged under the leadership of minister Cai Jing (1046\u20131126), who revived the New Policies of Wang Anshi, although he set out on a campaign of attrition to destroy or radically alter the written work of his predecessors and especially Conservative enemies.[151] For example, only six of Shen's books remain, and four of these have been significantly altered since the time they were penned by the author.[152]/nIn modern times, the best attempt at a complete list and summary of Shen's writing was an appendix written by Hu Daojing in his standard edition of Brush Talks, written in 1956.[153]/nShen Kuo's Dream Pool Essays consists of some 507 separate essays exploring a wide range of subjects.[154] It was Shen's ultimate attempt to comprehend and describe a multitude of various aspects of nature, science, and reality, and all the practical and profound curiosities found in the world. The literal translation of the title, Dream Brook Brush Talks, refers to his Dream Brook estate, where he spent the last years of his life. About the title, he is quoted as saying: \"Because I had only my writing brush and ink slab to converse with, I call it Brush Talks.\"[e]/nThe book was originally 30 chapters long, yet an unknown Chinese author's edition of 1166 edited and reorganized the work into 26 chapters.[155]/nAlthough the Dream Pool Essays is certainly his most extensive and important work, Shen Kuo wrote other books as well. In 1075, Shen Kuo wrote the Xining Fengyuan Li (\u7199\u5be7\u5949\u5143\u66c6; The Oblatory Epoch astronomical system of the Splendid Peace reign period), which was lost, but listed in a 7th chapter of a Song dynasty bibliography.[156] This was the official report of Shen Kuo on his reforms of the Chinese calendar, which were only partially adopted by the Song court's official calendar system.[156] During his years of retirement from governmental service, Shen Kuo compiled a formulary known as the Liang Fang (\u826f\u65b9; Good medicinal formulas).[157] Around the year 1126 it was combined with a similar collection by the famous Su Shi (1037\u20131101), who was ironically a political opponent to Shen Kuo's faction of Reformers and New Policies supporters at court,[157] yet it was known that Shen Kuo and Su Shi were nonetheless friends and associates.[158] Shen wrote the Mengqi Wanghuai Lu (\u5922\u6eaa\u5fd8\u61f7\u9304; Record of longings forgotten at Dream Brook), which was also compiled during Shen's retirement. This book was a treatise in the working since his youth on rural life and ethnographic accounts of living conditions in the isolated mountain regions of China.[159] Only quotations of it survive in the Shuo Fu (\u8aaa\u90db) collection, which mostly describe the agricultural implements and tools used by rural people in high mountain regions. Shen Kuo also wrote the Changxing Ji (\u9577\u8208\u96c6; Collected Literary Works of [the Viscount of] Changxing). However, this book was without much doubt a posthumous collection, including various poems, prose, and administrative documents written by Shen.[159] By the 15th century (during the Ming dynasty), this book was reprinted, yet only the 19th chapter remained.[159] This chapter was reprinted in 1718, yet poorly edited.[159] Finally, in the 1950s the author Hu Daojing supplemented this small yet valuable work with additions of other scattered poems written by Shen, in the former's Collection of Shen Kua's Extant Poetry (Shanghai: Shang-hai Shu-tian, 1958).[159] In the tradition of the popular Song era literary category of 'travel record literature' ('youji wenxue'),[160] Shen Kuo also wrote the Register of What Not to Forget, a traveler's guide to what type of carriage is suitable for a journey, the proper foods one should bring, the special clothing one should bring, and many other items.[161]/nIn his Sequel to Numerous Things Revealed, the Song author Cheng Dachang (1123\u20131195) noted that stanzas prepared by Shen Kuo for military victory celebrations were later written down and published by Shen.[162] This includes a short poem \"Song of Triumph\" by Shen Kuo, who uses the musical instrument mawei huqin ('horse-tail barbarian stringed instrument' or 'horse-tail fiddle'[163]) of the northwestern Inner Asian nomads as a metaphor for prisoners-of-war led by Song troops:/n:The mawei huqin followed the Han chariot,/nHistorian Jonathan Stock notes that the bent bow described in the poem above represents the arched bow used to play the huqin, while the sound of the instrument itself represented the discontent expressed by the prisoners-of-war with their defeated khan.[162]/nIn the Routledge Curzon Encyclopedia of Confucianism, Xinzhong Yao states that Shen Kuo's legacy was tainted by his eager involvement in Wang Anshi's New Policies reforms, his actions criticized in the later traditional histories.[1] However, Shen's reputation as a polymath has been well regarded. Joseph Needham stated that Shen Kuo was \"one of the greatest scientific minds in Chinese history.\"[164] The French sinologist Jacques Gernet is of the opinion that Shen possessed an \"amazingly modern mind.\"[165] Yao states of Shen's thorough recording of natural sciences in his Dream Pool Essays:/nWe must regard Shen Kuo's collection as an indispensable primary source attesting to the unmatched level of attainment achieved by Chinese science prior to the twelfth century.[166]/nHowever, Toby E. Huff writes that Shen Kuo's \"scattered set\" of writings lacks clear-cut organization and \"theoretical acuteness,\" that is, scientific theory.[167] Nathan Sivin wrote that Shen's originality stands \"cheek by jowl with trivial didacticism, court anecdotes, and ephemeral curiosities\" that provide little insight.[167] Donald Holzman writes that Shen \"has nowhere organized his observations into anything like a general theory.\"[167] Huff writes that this was a systemic problem of early Chinese science, which lacked systematic treatment that could be found in European works such as the Concordance and Discordant Canons by the lawyer Gratian of Bologna (fl. 12th century).[167] In regard to an overarching concept of science which could branch together all the various sciences studied by the Chinese, Sivin asserts that the writings of Shen Kuo \"do not indicate that he achieved, or even sought, an integrated framework for his diverse knowledge; the one common thread is the varied responsibilities of his career as a high civil servant.\"[168]/nUpon his death, Shen Kuo was interred in a tomb in Yuhang District of Hangzhou, at the foot of the Taiping Hill.[169] His tomb was eventually destroyed, yet Ming dynasty records indicated its location, which was found in 1983 and protected by the government in 1986.[169] The remnants of the tomb's brick structure remained, along with Song dynasty glasswares and coins.[169] The Hangzhou Municipal Committee completed a restoration of Shen's tomb in September 2001./nIn addition to his tomb, Shen Kuo's Mengxi garden estate, his former two-acre (8,000 m2) property in Zhenjiang, was restored by the government in 1985.[170] However, the renovated Mengxi Garden is only part of the original of Shen Kuo's time.[171] A Qing dynasty-era hall built on the site is now used as the main admissions gate.[170] In the Memorial Hall of the gardens, there is a large painting depicting the original garden of Shen Kuo's time, including wells, green bamboo groves, stone-paved paths, and decorated walls of the original halls.[171] In this exhibition hall there stands a 1.4\u00a0m (4.6\u00a0ft) tall statue of Shen Kuo sitting on a platform, along with centuries-old published copies of his Dream Pool Essays in glass cabinets, one of which is from Japan.[171] At the garden estate there are also displayed marble banners, statues of Shen Kuo, and a model of an armillary sphere; a small museum gallery depicts Shen's various achievements.[170]/nThe Purple Mountain Observatory in Nanjing discovered a new asteroid in 1964 and named it after Shen Kuo (2027 Shen Guo).[172]", "73650353": "Alma Johanna Ruubel (28 September 1899 \u2013 21 January 1990) was an Estonian mathematician and professor engaged in the development of curvilinear representational geometry./nAlma Johanna Ruubel was born in \u00d5isu Parish (present-day Viljandi Parish), Viljandi County, and grew up on the Peebu farm in the \u014cisu municipality of Viljandimaa. Her father, Juhan Ruubel, was a master builder and joiner and her mother Ann (n\u00e9e Mankin) was a housewife.[1]/nIn 1909, she entered the three-grade Russian-language Peebu school in \u00d5isu Parish and in 1912, the Viljandi Estonian Educational Society's Estonian-language girls' school from which she graduated in 1916. She continued her studies at the Russian-language Viljandi Girls' High School, which was converted into a seven-grade school during World War I and the German occupation in 1918. In order to continue her studies, Ruubel, together with other girls, formed a group of students of the eighth-grade course, which invited separate teachers. With the end of the German occupation, Viljandi City Girls' High School started working in Viljandi, and Alma's group was included in the eighth grade of the school there. Upon its completion in 1919, Ruubel was allowed to enter a university.[1][2]/nShe entered the summer teacher preparation courses organized by the University of Tartu (TR\u00dc), and in August 1919 she was already selected as a mathematics teacher at the P\u00e4rnu Commercial School. From the next school year, she worked as a teacher in her old school in Viljandi. Ruubel also continued her studies in the courses held at the university and finished them in 1921.[1]/nShe officially entered the University of Tartu in 1926. \u00a0At first, she earned money by giving tutoring lessons, but in 1929 Professor Gerhard R\u00e4go invited her to become an assistant at the Institute of Mathematics, even though she was only a third-year student. With this, Ruubel became the first female lecturer in mathematics at the University of Tartu. In 1932, she graduated cum laude.[3]/nIn 1935, she wanted to start research related to numerical and graphical methods. Professor R\u00e4go recommended to her John Couch Adams's method of numerical integration of differential equations and Richard von Mises's recently published error estimation approach to that method. R\u00e4go considered her finished research suitable for submission as a master's thesis. Ruubel received her master's degree in mathematics in 1936. Her thesis, \"The JC Adams Method for the Numerical Integration of Ordinary Differential Equations,\" was recertified in 1946 and she was awarded a Ph.D. in Physics and Mathematics.[1][3]/nAfter graduating from the university, Ruubel continued to work there, first as a senior teacher and later as an associate professor (appointed in 1949). She taught theoretical mechanics, applied mathematics, computational and graphical methods, probability theory, analytical, differential and representational geometry, and higher mathematics. She also worked in leading positions, being the head of the department, the vice-dean and dean of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, the supervisor of the postgraduate course and the head of the methodological council.[1][2]/nIn 1952, the department of visual geometry of the Estonian Academy of Agriculture was opened, and Ruubel was invited to head it. This allowed her to focus on her subject. At the same time, she continued to work at TR\u00dc as an associate professor until 1955. Later, in 1969, she was invited to be a member of the Scientific Council of the Faculty of Mathematics of TR\u00dc for another three years.[2]/nRuubel's work at the university led her to establish a new branch of mathematics, namely curvilinear representational geometry. She spoke at many scientific conferences in Moscow, Leningrad, Tallinn as well as Tartu to introduce it and publish brochures and articles. After the Department of Visual Geometry and Graphics was merged with other departments, she worked until her retirement in 1968 as an Associate Professor of the Combined Department and headed the Section of Visual Geometry and Graphics.

He had two brothers, Patrick (deceased) and Joe, and a sister, Selma (deceased).[7] Atiyah went to primary school at the Diocesan school in Khartoum, Sudan (1934\u20131941), and to secondary school at Victoria College in Cairo and Alexandria (1941\u20131945); the school was also attended by European nobility displaced by the Second World War and some future leaders of Arab nations.[8] He returned to England and Manchester Grammar School for his HSC studies (1945\u20131947) and did his national service with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (1947\u20131949). His undergraduate and postgraduate studies took place at Trinity College, Cambridge (1949\u20131955).[9] He was a doctoral student of William V. D. Hodge[2] and was awarded a doctorate in 1955 for a thesis entitled Some Applications of Topological Methods in Algebraic Geometry.[1][2]/nAtiyah was a member of the British Humanist Association.[10]/nDuring his time at Cambridge, he was president of The Archimedeans.[11]/nAtiyah spent the academic year 1955\u20131956 at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, then returned to Cambridge University, where he was a research fellow and assistant lecturer (1957\u20131958), then a university lecturer and tutorial fellow at Pembroke College, Cambridge (1958\u20131961). In 1961, he moved to the University of Oxford, where he was a reader and professorial fellow at St Catherine's College (1961\u20131963).[9] He became Savilian Professor of Geometry and a professorial fellow of New College, Oxford, from 1963 to 1969. He took up a three-year professorship at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton after which he returned to Oxford as a Royal Society Research Professor and professorial fellow of St Catherine's College. He was president of the London Mathematical Society from 1974 to 1976.[9]/nI started out by changing local currency into foreign currency everywhere I travelled as a child and ended up making money. That's when my father realised that I would be a mathematician some day./nMichael Atiyah[12]/nAtiyah was president of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs from 1997 to 2002.[13] He also contributed to the foundation of the InterAcademy Panel on International Issues, the Association of European Academies (ALLEA), and the European Mathematical Society (EMS).[14]/nWithin the United Kingdom, he was involved in the creation of the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Cambridge and was its first director (1990\u20131996). He was President of the Royal Society (1990\u20131995), Master of Trinity College, Cambridge (1990\u20131997),[13] Chancellor of the University of Leicester (1995\u20132005),[13] and president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (2005\u20132008).[15] From 1997 until his death in 2019 he was an honorary professor in the University of Edinburgh.  He was a Trustee of the James Clerk Maxwell Foundation.[16]/nAtiyah's mathematical collaborators included Raoul Bott, Friedrich Hirzebruch[17] and Isadore Singer, and his students included Graeme Segal, Nigel Hitchin, Simon Donaldson, and Edward Witten.[18] Together with Hirzebruch, he laid the foundations for topological K-theory, an important tool in algebraic topology, which, informally speaking, describes ways in which spaces can be twisted. His best known result, the Atiyah\u2013Singer index theorem, was proved with Singer in 1963 and is used in counting the number of independent solutions to differential equations. Some of his more recent work was inspired by theoretical physics, in particular instantons and monopoles, which are responsible for some corrections in quantum field theory. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1966 and the Abel Prize in 2004./nAtiyah collaborated with many mathematicians. His three main collaborations were with Raoul Bott on the Atiyah\u2013Bott fixed-point theorem and many other topics, with Isadore M. Singer on the Atiyah\u2013Singer index theorem, and with Friedrich Hirzebruch on topological K-theory,[19] all of whom he met at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in 1955.[20] His other collaborators included; J.

There is nothing like having somebody else beside you, because he can usually peer round the corner./nMichael Atiyah[24]/nAtiyah's students included \nPeter Braam 1987,\nSimon Donaldson 1983,\nK.

V. D. Hodge and won the Smith's prize for 1954 for a sheaf-theoretic approach to ruled surfaces,[31] which encouraged Atiyah to continue in mathematics, rather than switch to his other interests\u2014architecture and archaeology.[32]\nHis PhD thesis with Hodge was on a sheaf-theoretic approach to Solomon Lefschetz's theory of integrals of the second kind on algebraic varieties, and resulted in an invitation to visit the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton for a year.[33] While in Princeton he classified vector bundles on an elliptic curve (extending Alexander Grothendieck's classification of vector bundles on a genus 0 curve), by showing that any vector bundle is a sum of (essentially unique) indecomposable vector bundles,[34] and then showing that the space of indecomposable vector bundles of given degree and positive dimension can be identified with the elliptic curve.[35] He also studied double points on surfaces,[36] giving the first example of a flop, a special birational transformation of 3-folds that was later heavily used in Shigefumi Mori's work on minimal models for 3-folds.[37] Atiyah's flop can also be used to show that the universal marked family of K3 surfaces is not Hausdorff.[38]/nAtiyah's works on K-theory, including his book on K-theory[39] are reprinted in volume 2 of his collected works.[40]/nThe simplest nontrivial example of a vector bundle is the M\u00f6bius band (pictured on the right): a strip of paper with a twist in it, which represents a rank 1 vector bundle over a circle (the circle in question being the centerline of the M\u00f6bius band). K-theory is a tool for working with higher-dimensional analogues of this example, or in other words for describing higher-dimensional twistings: elements of the K-group of a space are represented by vector bundles over it, so the M\u00f6bius band represents an element of the K-group of a circle.[41]/nTopological K-theory was discovered by Atiyah and Friedrich Hirzebruch[42] who were inspired by Grothendieck's proof of the Grothendieck\u2013Riemann\u2013Roch theorem and Bott's work on the periodicity theorem. This paper only discussed the zeroth K-group; they shortly after extended it to K-groups of all degrees,[43] giving the first (nontrivial) example of a generalized cohomology theory./nSeveral results showed that the newly introduced K-theory was in some ways more powerful than ordinary cohomology theory. Atiyah and Todd[44] used K-theory to improve the lower bounds found using ordinary cohomology by Borel and Serre for the James number, describing when a map from a complex Stiefel manifold to a sphere has a cross section. (Adams and Grant-Walker later showed that the bound found by Atiyah and Todd was best possible.) Atiyah and Hirzebruch[45] used K-theory to explain some relations between Steenrod operations and Todd classes that Hirzebruch had noticed a few years before. The original solution of the Hopf invariant one problem operations by J. F. Adams was very long and complicated, using secondary cohomology operations. Atiyah showed how primary operations in K-theory could be used to give a short solution taking only a few lines, and in joint work with Adams[46] also proved analogues of the result at odd primes./nThe Atiyah\u2013Hirzebruch spectral sequence relates the ordinary cohomology of a space to its generalized cohomology theory.[43] (Atiyah and Hirzebruch used the case of K-theory, but their method works for all cohomology theories)./nAtiyah showed[47] that for a finite group G, the K theory of its classifying space, BG, is isomorphic to the completion of its character ring:/nThe same year[48] they proved the result for G any compact connected Lie group. Although soon the result could be extended to all compact Lie groups by incorporating results from Graeme Segal's thesis,[49] that extension was complicated. However a simpler and more general proof was produced by introducing equivariant K-theory, i.e. equivalence classes of G-vector bundles over a compact G-space X.[50] It was shown that under suitable conditions the completion of the equivariant K theory of X is isomorphic to the ordinary K-theory of a space, \n\n\n\n\nX\n\nG\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X_{G}}\n\n, which fibred over BG with fibre X:/nThe original result then followed as a corollary by taking X to be a point: the left hand side reduced to the completion of R(G) and the right to K(BG). See Atiyah\u2013Segal completion theorem for more details./nHe defined new generalized homology and cohomology theories called bordism and cobordism, and pointed out that many of the deep results on cobordism of manifolds found by Ren\u00e9 Thom, C. T. C. Wall, and others could be naturally reinterpreted as statements about these cohomology theories.[51] Some of these cohomology theories, in particular complex cobordism, turned out to be some of the most powerful cohomology theories known./n\"Algebra is the offer made by the devil to the mathematician. The devil says: `I will give you this powerful machine, it will answer any question you like. All you need to do is give me your soul: give up geometry and you will have this marvellous machine.\"/nMichael Atiyah[52]/nHe introduced[53] the J-group J(X) of a finite complex X, defined as the group of stable fiber homotopy equivalence classes of sphere bundles; this was later studied in detail by J. F. Adams in a series of papers, leading to the Adams conjecture./nWith Hirzebruch he extended the Grothendieck\u2013Riemann\u2013Roch theorem to complex analytic embeddings,[53] and in a related paper[54] they showed that the Hodge conjecture for integral cohomology is false. The Hodge conjecture for rational cohomology is, as of 2008, a major unsolved problem.[55]/nThe Bott periodicity theorem was a central theme in Atiyah's work on K-theory, and he repeatedly returned to it, reworking the proof several times to understand it better. With Bott he worked out an elementary proof,[56] and gave another version of it in his book.[57] With Bott and Shapiro he analysed the relation of Bott periodicity to the periodicity of Clifford algebras;[58] although this paper did not have a proof of the periodicity theorem, a proof along similar lines was shortly afterwards found by R. Wood.  He found a proof of several generalizations using elliptic operators;[59] this new proof used an idea that he used to give a particularly short and easy proof of Bott's original periodicity theorem.[60]/nAtiyah's work on index theory is reprinted in volumes 3 and 4 of his collected works.[61][62]/nThe index of a differential operator is closely related to the number of independent solutions (more precisely, it is the differences of the numbers of independent solutions of the differential operator and its adjoint). There are many hard and fundamental problems in mathematics that can easily be reduced to the problem of finding the number of independent solutions of some differential operator, so if one has some means of finding the index of a differential operator these problems can often be solved. This is what the Atiyah\u2013Singer index theorem does: it gives a formula for the index of certain differential operators, in terms of topological invariants that look quite complicated but are in practice usually straightforward to calculate.[citation needed]/nSeveral deep theorems, such as the Hirzebruch\u2013Riemann\u2013Roch theorem, are special cases of the Atiyah\u2013Singer index theorem. In fact the index theorem gave a more powerful result, because its proof applied to all compact complex manifolds, while Hirzebruch's proof only worked for projective manifolds. There were also many new applications: a typical one is calculating the dimensions of the moduli spaces of instantons. The index theorem can also be run \"in reverse\": the index is obviously an integer, so the formula for it must also give an integer, which sometimes gives subtle integrality conditions on invariants of manifolds. A typical example of this is Rochlin's theorem, which follows from the index theorem.[citation needed]/nThe most useful piece of advice I would give to a mathematics student is always to suspect an impressive sounding Theorem if it does not have a special case which is both simple and non-trivial./nMichael Atiyah[63]/nThe index problem for elliptic differential operators was posed in 1959 by Gel'fand.[64] He noticed the homotopy invariance of the index, and asked for a formula for it by means of topological invariants. Some of the motivating examples included the Riemann\u2013Roch theorem and its generalization the Hirzebruch\u2013Riemann\u2013Roch theorem, and the Hirzebruch signature theorem. Hirzebruch and Borel had proved the integrality of the \u00c2 genus of a spin manifold, and Atiyah suggested that this integrality could be explained if it were the index of the Dirac operator (which was rediscovered by Atiyah and Singer in 1961)./nThe first announcement of the Atiyah\u2013Singer theorem was their 1963 paper.[65] The proof sketched in this announcement was inspired by Hirzebruch's proof of the Hirzebruch\u2013Riemann\u2013Roch theorem and was never published by them, though it is described in the book by Palais.[66] Their first published proof[67] was more similar to Grothendieck's proof of the Grothendieck\u2013Riemann\u2013Roch theorem, replacing the cobordism theory of the first proof with K-theory, and they used this approach to give proofs of various generalizations in a sequence of papers from 1968 to 1971./nInstead of just one elliptic operator, one can consider a family of elliptic operators parameterized by some space Y. In this case the index is an element of the K theory of Y, rather than an integer.[68] If the operators in the family are real, then the index lies in the real K theory of Y. This gives a little extra information, as the map from the real K theory of Y to the complex K-theory is not always injective.[69]/nWith Bott, Atiyah found an analogue of the Lefschetz fixed-point formula for elliptic operators, giving the Lefschetz number of an endomorphism of an elliptic complex in terms of a sum over the fixed points of the endomorphism.[70] As special cases their formula included the Weyl character formula, and several new results about elliptic curves with complex multiplication, some of which were initially disbelieved by experts.[71]\nAtiyah and Segal combined this fixed point theorem with the index theorem as follows.\nIf there is a compact group action of a group G on the compact manifold X, commuting with the elliptic operator, then one can replace ordinary K-theory in the index theorem with equivariant K-theory.\nFor trivial groups G this gives the index theorem, and for a finite group G acting with isolated fixed points it gives the Atiyah\u2013Bott fixed point theorem. In general it gives the index as a sum over fixed point submanifolds of the group G.[72]/nAtiyah[73] solved a problem asked independently by H\u00f6rmander and Gel'fand, about whether complex powers of analytic functions define distributions. Atiyah used Hironaka's resolution of singularities to answer this affirmatively. An ingenious and elementary solution was found at about the same time by J. Bernstein, and discussed by Atiyah.[74]/nAs an application of the equivariant index theorem, Atiyah and Hirzebruch showed that manifolds with effective circle actions have vanishing \u00c2-genus.[75] (Lichnerowicz showed that if a manifold has a metric of positive scalar curvature then the \u00c2-genus vanishes.)/nWith Elmer Rees, Atiyah studied the problem of the relation between topological and holomorphic vector bundles on projective space. They solved the simplest unknown case, by showing that all rank 2 vector bundles over projective 3-space have a holomorphic structure.[76] Horrocks had previously found some non-trivial examples of such vector bundles, which were later used by Atiyah in his study of instantons on the 4-sphere./nAtiyah, Bott and Vijay K. Patodi[77] gave a new proof of the index theorem using the heat equation./nIf the manifold is allowed to have boundary, then some restrictions must be put on the domain of the elliptic operator in order to ensure a finite index. These conditions can be local (like demanding that the sections in the domain vanish at the boundary) or more complicated global conditions (like requiring that the sections in the domain solve some differential equation). The local case was worked out by Atiyah and Bott, but they showed that many interesting operators (e.g., the signature operator) do not admit local boundary conditions. To handle these operators, Atiyah, Patodi and Singer introduced global boundary conditions equivalent to attaching a cylinder to the manifold along the boundary and then restricting the domain to those sections that are square integrable along the cylinder, and also introduced the Atiyah\u2013Patodi\u2013Singer eta invariant. This resulted in a series of papers on spectral asymmetry,[78] which were later unexpectedly used in theoretical physics, in particular in Witten's work on anomalies./nThe fundamental solutions of linear hyperbolic partial differential equations often have Petrovsky lacunas: regions where they vanish identically. These were studied in 1945 by I. G. Petrovsky, who found topological conditions describing which regions were lacunas.\nIn collaboration with Bott and Lars G\u00e5rding, Atiyah wrote three papers updating and generalizing Petrovsky's work.[79]/nAtiyah[80] showed how to extend the index theorem to some non-compact manifolds, acted on by a discrete group with compact quotient. The kernel of the elliptic operator is in general infinite-dimensional in this case, but it is possible to get a finite index using the dimension of a module over a von Neumann algebra; this index is in general real rather than integer valued. This version is called the L2 index theorem, and was used by Atiyah and Schmid[81] to give a geometric construction, using square integrable harmonic spinors, of Harish-Chandra's discrete series representations of semisimple Lie groups. In the course of this work they found a more elementary proof of Harish-Chandra's fundamental theorem on the local integrability of characters of Lie groups.[82]/nWith H. Donnelly and I. Singer, he extended Hirzebruch's formula (relating the signature defect at cusps of Hilbert modular surfaces to values of L-functions) from real quadratic fields to all totally real fields.[83]/nMany of his papers on gauge theory and related topics are reprinted in volume 5 of his collected works.[84] A common theme of these papers is the study of moduli spaces of solutions to certain non-linear partial differential equations, in particular the equations for instantons and monopoles. This often involves finding a subtle correspondence between solutions of two seemingly quite different equations. An early example of this which Atiyah used repeatedly is the Penrose transform, which can sometimes convert solutions of a non-linear equation over some real manifold into solutions of some linear holomorphic equations over a different complex manifold./nIn a series of papers with several authors, Atiyah classified all instantons on 4-dimensional Euclidean space. It is more convenient to classify instantons on a sphere as this is compact, and this is essentially equivalent to classifying instantons on Euclidean space as this is conformally equivalent to a sphere and the equations for instantons are conformally invariant. With Hitchin and Singer[85] he calculated the dimension of the moduli space of irreducible self-dual connections (instantons) for any principal bundle over a compact 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold (the Atiyah\u2013Hitchin\u2013Singer theorem). For example, the dimension of the space of SU2 instantons of rank k>0 is 8k\u22123. To do this they used the Atiyah\u2013Singer index theorem to calculate the dimension of the tangent space of the moduli space at a point; the tangent space is essentially the space of solutions of an elliptic differential operator, given by the linearization of the non-linear Yang\u2013Mills equations. These moduli spaces were later used by Donaldson to construct his invariants of 4-manifolds.\nAtiyah and Ward used the Penrose correspondence to reduce the classification of all instantons on the 4-sphere to a problem in algebraic geometry.[86] With Hitchin he used ideas of Horrocks to solve this problem, giving the ADHM construction of all instantons on a sphere; Manin and Drinfeld found the same construction at the same time, leading to a joint paper by all four authors.[87] Atiyah reformulated this construction using quaternions and wrote up a leisurely account of this classification of instantons on Euclidean space as a book.[88]/nThe mathematical problems that have been solved or techniques that have arisen out of physics in the past have been the lifeblood of mathematics./nMichael Atiyah[89]/nAtiyah's work on instanton moduli spaces was used in Donaldson's work on Donaldson theory. Donaldson showed that the moduli space of (degree 1) instantons over a compact simply connected 4-manifold with positive definite intersection form can be compactified to give a cobordism between the manifold and a sum of copies of complex projective space. He deduced from this that the intersection form must be a sum of one-dimensional ones, which led to several spectacular applications to smooth 4-manifolds, such as the existence of non-equivalent smooth structures on 4-dimensional Euclidean space. Donaldson went on to use the other moduli spaces studied by Atiyah to define Donaldson invariants, which revolutionized the study of smooth 4-manifolds, and showed that they were more subtle than smooth manifolds in any other dimension, and also quite different from topological 4-manifolds. Atiyah described some of these results in a survey talk.[90]/nGreen's functions for linear partial differential equations can often be found by using the Fourier transform to convert this into an algebraic problem. Atiyah used a non-linear version of this idea.[91] He used the Penrose transform to convert the Green's function for the conformally invariant Laplacian into a complex analytic object, which turned out to be essentially the diagonal embedding of the Penrose twistor space into its square. This allowed him to find an explicit formula for the conformally invariant Green's function on a 4-manifold./nIn his paper with Jones,[92] he studied the topology of the moduli space of SU(2) instantons over a 4-sphere. They showed that the natural map from this moduli space to the space of all connections induces epimorphisms of homology groups in a certain range of dimensions, and suggested that it might induce isomorphisms of homology groups in the same range of dimensions. This became known as the Atiyah\u2013Jones conjecture, and was later proved by several mathematicians.[93]/nHarder and M. S. Narasimhan described the cohomology of the moduli spaces of stable vector bundles over Riemann surfaces by counting the number of points of the moduli spaces over finite fields, and then using the Weil conjectures to recover the cohomology over the complex numbers.[94]\nAtiyah and R. Bott used Morse theory and the Yang\u2013Mills equations over a Riemann surface to reproduce and extending the results of Harder and Narasimhan.[95]/nAn old result due to Schur and Horn states that the set of possible diagonal vectors of an Hermitian matrix with given eigenvalues is the convex hull of all the permutations of the eigenvalues. Atiyah proved a generalization of this that applies to all compact symplectic manifolds acted on by a torus, showing that the image of the manifold under the moment map is a convex polyhedron,[96] and with Pressley gave a related generalization to infinite-dimensional loop groups.[97]/nDuistermaat and Heckman found a striking formula, saying that the push-forward of the Liouville measure of a moment map for a torus action is given exactly by the stationary phase approximation (which is in general just an asymptotic expansion rather than exact). Atiyah and Bott[98] showed that this could be deduced from a more general formula in equivariant cohomology, which was a consequence of well-known localization theorems. Atiyah showed[99] that the moment map was closely related to geometric invariant theory, and this idea was later developed much further by his student F. Kirwan. Witten shortly after applied the Duistermaat\u2013Heckman formula to loop spaces and showed that this formally gave the Atiyah\u2013Singer index theorem for the Dirac operator; this idea was lectured on by Atiyah.[100]/nWith Hitchin he worked on magnetic monopoles, and studied their scattering using an idea of Nick Manton.[101] His book[102] with Hitchin gives a detailed description of their work on magnetic monopoles. The main theme of the book is a study of a moduli space of magnetic monopoles; this has a natural Riemannian metric, and a key point is that this metric is complete and hyperk\u00e4hler. The metric is then used to study the scattering of two monopoles, using a suggestion of N. Manton that the geodesic flow on the moduli space is the low energy approximation to the scattering. For example, they show that a head-on collision between two monopoles results in 90-degree scattering, with the direction of scattering depending on the relative phases of the two monopoles. He also studied monopoles on hyperbolic space.[103]/nAtiyah showed[104] that instantons in 4 dimensions can be identified with instantons in 2 dimensions, which are much easier to handle. There is of course a catch: in going from 4 to 2 dimensions the structure group of the gauge theory changes from a finite-dimensional group to an infinite-dimensional loop group. This gives another example where the moduli spaces of solutions of two apparently unrelated nonlinear partial differential equations turn out to be essentially the same./nAtiyah and Singer found that anomalies in quantum field theory could be interpreted in terms of index theory of the Dirac operator;[105] this idea later became widely used by physicists./nMany of the papers in the 6th volume[106] of his collected works are surveys, obituaries, and general talks. Atiyah continued to publish subsequently, including several surveys, a popular book,[107] and another paper with Segal on twisted K-theory./nOne paper[108] is a detailed study of the Dedekind eta function from the point of view of topology and the index theorem./nSeveral of his papers from around this time study the connections between quantum field theory, knots, and Donaldson theory. He introduced the concept of a topological quantum field theory, inspired by Witten's work and Segal's definition of a conformal field theory.[109] His book \u201cThe Geometry and Physics of Knots\u201d [110] describes the new knot invariants found by Vaughan Jones and Edward Witten in terms of topological quantum field theories, and his paper with L. Jeffrey[111] explains Witten's Lagrangian giving the Donaldson invariants./nHe studied skyrmions with Nick Manton,[112] finding a relation with magnetic monopoles and instantons, and giving a conjecture for the structure of the moduli space of two skyrmions as a certain subquotient of complex projective 3-space./nSeveral papers[113] were inspired by a question of Jonathan Robbins (called the Berry\u2013Robbins problem), who asked if there is a map from the configuration space of n points in 3-space to the flag manifold of the unitary group. Atiyah gave an affirmative answer to this question, but felt his solution was too computational and studied a conjecture that would give a more natural solution. He also related the question to Nahm's equation, and introduced the Atiyah conjecture on configurations./nBut for most practical purposes, you just use the classical groups. The exceptional Lie groups are just there to show you that the theory is a bit bigger; it is pretty rare that they ever turn up./nMichael Atiyah[114]/nWith Juan Maldacena and Cumrun Vafa,[115] and E. Witten[116] he described the dynamics of M-theory on manifolds with G2 holonomy. These papers seem to be the first time that Atiyah worked on exceptional Lie groups./nIn his papers with M. Hopkins[117] and G.

Since his mother was fond of the name Terry, the parents adopted it as a nickname for Tyrrell and soon everybody referred to him as Terry.[3]/nRockafellar is a distant relative of the American business magnate and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller. They both can trace their ancestors back to two brothers named Rockenfelder that came to America from the Rhineland-Pfaltz region of Germany in 1728. Soon the spelling of the family name evolved, resulting in Rockafellar, Rockefeller, and many other versions of the name.[4]/nRockafellar moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts to attend Harvard College in 1953. Majoring in mathematics, he graduated from Harvard in 1957 with summa cum laude. He was also elected for the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. Rockafellar was a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Bonn in 1957\u201358 and completed a Master of Science degree at Marquette University in 1959. Formally under the guidance of Professor Garrett Birkhoff, Rockafellar completed his Doctor of Philosophy degree in mathematics from Harvard University in 1963 with the dissertation \u201cConvex Functions and Dual Extremum Problems.\u201d However, at the time there was little interest in convexity and optimization at Harvard and Birkhoff was neither involved with the research nor familiar with the subject.[5] The dissertation was inspired by the duality theory of linear programming developed by John von Neumann, which Rockafellar learned about through volumes of recent papers compiled by Albert W. Tucker at Princeton University.[6] Rockafellar\u2019s dissertation together with the contemporary work by Jean-Jacques Moreau in France are regarded as the birth of convex analysis./nAfter graduating from Harvard, Rockafellar became Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the University of Texas, Austin, where he also was affiliated with the Department of Computer Science. After two years, he moved to University of Washington in Seattle where he filled joint positions in the Departments of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from 1966 to 2003 when he retired. He is presently Professor Emeritus at the university.

The Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) lists Rockafellar as a highly cited researcher.[8]/nRockafellar\u2019s research is motivated by the goal of organizing mathematical ideas and concepts into robust frameworks that yield new insights and relations.[9] This approach is most salient in his seminal book \"Variational Analysis\" (1998, with Roger J-B  Wets), where numerous threads developed in the areas of convex analysis, nonlinear analysis, calculus of variation, mathematical optimization, equilibrium theory, and control systems were brought together to produce a unified approach to variational problems in finite dimensions. These various fields of study are now referred to as variational analysis. In particular, the text dispenses of differentiability as a necessary property in many areas of analysis and embraces nonsmoothness, set-valuedness, and extended real-valuedness, while still developing far-reaching calculus rules./nThe approach of extending the real line with the values infinity and negative infinity and then allowing (convex) functions to take these values can be traced back to Rockafellar\u2019s dissertation and, independently, the work by Jean-Jacques Moreau around the same time. The central role of set-valued mappings (also called multivalued functions) was also recognized in Rockafellar\u2019s dissertation and, in fact, the standard notation \u2202f(x) for the set of subgradients of a function f at x originated there./nRockafellar contributed to nonsmooth analysis by extending the rule of Fermat, which characterizes solutions of optimization problems, to composite problems using subgradient calculus and variational geometry and thereby bypassing the implicit function theorem. The approach broadens the notion of Lagrange multipliers to settings beyond smooth equality and inequality systems. In his doctoral dissertation and numerous later publications, Rockafellar developed a general duality theory based on convex conjugate functions that centers on embedding a problem within a family of problems obtained by a perturbation of parameters. This encapsulates linear programming duality and Lagrangian duality, and extends to general convex problems as well as nonconvex ones, especially when combined with an augmentation./nRockafellar also worked on applied problems and computational aspects. In the 1970s, he contributed to the development of the proximal point method, which underpins several successful algorithms including the proximal gradient method often used in statistical applications. He placed the analysis of expectation functions in stochastic programming on solid footing by defining and analyzing normal integrands. Rockafellar also contributed to the analysis of control systems and general equilibrium theory in economics./nSince the late 1990s, Rockafellar has been actively involved with organizing and expanding the mathematical concepts for risk assessment and decision making in financial engineering and reliability engineering. This includes examining the mathematical properties of risk measures and coining the terms \"conditional value-at-risk,\" in 2000 as well as \"superquantile\" and \"buffered failure probability\" in 2010, which either coincide with or are closely related to expected shortfall.", "5034215": "Robert Louis Griess, Jr. (born 1945, Savannah, Georgia) is a mathematician working on finite simple groups and vertex algebras.[1]  He is currently the John Griggs Thompson Distinguished University Professor of mathematics at University of Michigan.[2]/nGriess developed a keen interest in mathematics prior to entering undergraduate studies at the University of Chicago in the fall of 1963.[3] There, he eventually earned a Ph.D. in 1971 after defending a dissertation on the Schur multipliers of the then-known finite simple groups.[4]/nGriess' work has focused on group extensions, cohomology and Schur multipliers, as well as on vertex operator algebras and the classification of finite simple groups.[5][6] In 1982, he published the first construction of the monster group using the Griess algebra, and in 1983 he was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Warsaw to give a lecture on the sporadic groups and his construction of the monster group.[7] In the same landmark 1982 paper where he published his construction, Griess detailed an organization of the twenty-six sporadic groups into two general families of groups: the Happy Family and the pariahs.[8]/nHe became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2007, and a fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2012.[9][10] In 2020 he became a member of the National Academy of Sciences.[11] Since 2006, Robert Griess has been an editor for Electronic Research Announcements of the AIMS (ERA-AIMS), a peer-review journal.[12]/nIn 2010, he was awarded the AMS Leroy P.

His work centered mostly on combinatorics and probability.[1]/nHindenburg did not attend school but was educated at home by a private tutor as arranged by his merchant father. He went to the University of Leipzig in 1757 and took courses in medicine, philosophy, Latin, Greek, physics, mathematics, and aesthetics. Hindenburg later published on philology in 1763 and 1769.[1]/nHindenburg was mentored by Christian F\u00fcrchtegott Gellert, a popular lecturer in Leipzig who introduced Hindenburg to a student named Sch\u00f6nborn.  Sch\u00f6nborn's interest in mathematics influenced Hindenburg to go into the field as well. He obtained a master's degree from the University of Leipzig in 1771.[1]/nOn obtaining his master's degree at Leipzig in 1771, Hindenburg was made Privatdozent there.[1]/nIn 1781, Hindenburg was appointed as professor of philosophy in the University of Leipzig. He would be appointed professor of physics in 1786 after presenting a dissertation on water pumps. Hindenburg served as academic dean at the University of Leipzig, where he was also Rector in 1792. He became a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences on 5 August 1806.[2]/nHindenburg's first published mathematical publication, Beschreibung einer ganz neuen art, nach einem bekannten Gesetze fortgehende Zahlen, durch Abzahlen oder Abmessen bequem und sicher zu finden, originated as a project to extend then-existing prime tables up to 5 million. In the book, he mechanically realizes, independent of the work done by Felkel,[3] the sieve of Eratosthenes, which he then proceeds with rules to both optimize and organize. The book also contained results in linear diophantine analysis, decimal periods, combinations, and gave combinatorial significance to the digits of numbers written in decimal notation./nIn 1778, he started publishing a series of works on combinatorics, particularly on probability, series and formulae for higher differentials. He worked on a generalization of the binomial theorem and was a major influence in Gudermann's work on the expansion of functions into power series./nHindenburg co-founded the first German mathematical journals.[4] Between 1780 and 1800, he was involved at different times with the publishing of four different journals all relating to mathematics and its applications. Two of the journals, the Leipziger Magazin f\u00fcr reine und angewandte Mathematik (1786\u20131789) and the Archiv f\u00fcr reine und angewandte Mathematik (1795\u20131799), published Johann Heinrich Lambert's Nachlass as edited by Johann Bernoulli.[5] In 1796, he edited the Sammlung combinatorisch-analytischer Abhandlungen, which contained a claim that de Moivre's multinomial theorem was \u201cthe most important proposition in all of mathematical analysis\u201d.[4]/nOne of Hindenburg's best students, according to Donald Knuth, is Heinrich August Rothe.[6] Another student, Johann Karl Burckhardt published the book Theorie der Kettenbr\u00fcche after being encouraged by Hindenburg to work on continued fractions.[7] He also influenced Christian Kramp's work in combinatorics.[8]", "3985689": "Tirukkannapuram Vijayaraghavan (Tamil: \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0ba3\u0baa\u0bc1\u0bb0\u0bae\u0bcd \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0b9c\u0baf\u0bb0\u0bbe\u0b95\u0bb5\u0ba9\u0bcd; 30 November 1902 \u2013 20 April 1955) was an Indian mathematician from the Madras region.

In 1799, Wessel was the first person to describe the geometrical interpretation of complex numbers as points in the complex plane and vectors.[1]/nWessel was born in Jonsrud, Vestby, Akershus in Norway to pastor Jonas Wessel (1707\u20131785) and Helene Marie Schumacher (1715\u20131789). Helene came from Drammen and was of Griffenfeldts heritage. Growing up in Wesselstuen in Vestby he was one of thirteen children in a family. His brothers include Johan Herman Wessel and Ole Christopher Wessel. Wessel is the grandnephew of the nobleman Peter Tordenskjold, brother in law of Maren Juel and the great-great-great-grandfather to the famous radio engineer Jan Wessel.[2]/nIn 1763, having completed secondary school at Oslo Cathedral School, he went to Denmark for further studies. He attended the University of Copenhagen to study law, but due to financial pressures, could do so for only a year. To survive, he became an assistant land surveyor to his brother and they worked on the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters' topographical survey of Denmark. This was not enough, however, and he took on extra work as a cartographer. He worked as a surveyor for the rest of his life, stopping only for a sabbatical year in 1778 to finish his law degree.[3] By 1798 Wessel had risen to the supervisory role of Royal Inspector of Surveying.[4]/nIt was the mathematical aspect of surveying that led him to exploring the geometrical significance of complex numbers. His fundamental paper, Om directionens analytiske betegning, was presented in 1797 to the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters.[5] Since it was in Danish and published in a journal rarely read outside of Denmark, it went unnoticed for nearly a century.[4] The same results were independently rediscovered by Jean-Robert Argand in 1806 and Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1831.[3]/n\"It is now Norway's cause to do what should be done, that this strange Man's Memory may be brought forth by Oblivion and his Name find its proper place before the History of Mathematics.\"/nSophus Lie/nIt was first when a Danish student wrote a doctoral dissertation on \"Danish mathematics in the 18th century\" that the universal significance of Wessel was brought up. While the student didn't realize the contribution by himself, the supervisors did. The dissertation created a great uproar and resulted in a front-page article in Dagbladet and Sophus Lie taking action to raise awareness of Wessel. In fact, Lie wrote in the article that \"It is now Norway's cause to do what should be done, that this strange Man's Memory may be brought forth by Oblivion and his Name find its proper place before the History of Mathematics.\"[6]/nOne of the more prominent ideas presented in \"On the Analytical Representation of Direction\" was that of vectors. Even though this was not Wessel's main intention with the publication, he felt that a geometrical concept of numbers, with length and direction, was needed. Wessel's approach on addition was: \"Two straight lines are added together, when one joins them together so that one begins where the other one ends, and next one draws a straight line from the first to the last point of the joined lines, and takes this to be their sum\". This is the same idea as used today in summing vectors.[7]/nThe importance of Wessel's contribution to the idea of a complex number as a point in the complex plane is today universally recognised. His paper was re-issued in French translation in 1897,[8] and in English in 1999 as On the analytic representation of direction (eds. Branner & L\u00fctzen).[9]/nFrom 1764 to 1805, Wessel participated in the survey of Denmark, Schleswig, Holstein and the Duchy of Oldenburg. His map of Schleswig-Holstein was requested by Napoleon Bonaparte.[10]/nWessel had a modest and quiet personality, he was described by his brother Johan Herman as \"He draws maps and reads the law. He's as diligent as I am lazy\".[11] No portraits of Wessel seem to have survived.[7]/nIn 1780 he married Cathrine Elisabeth Brinck f. M\u00fcller in Copenhagen.[12]/nOn 1 July 1815, Wessel was made a knight of the Order of the Dannebrog for his contributions to surveying; the cross of the Order of the Dannebrog was presented to him at the Royal Palace of Amalienborg[where?] on 4 August 1815.[7]/nA Source Book in Mathematics, by David Eugene Smith, has \"essential\" passages of \"Om directionens analytiske betegning\" translated into English (see page 55).", "49271067": "The name Antiphon the Sophist (/\u02c8\u00e6nt\u0259\u02ccf\u0252n, -\u0259n/; Greek: \u1f08\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c6\u1ff6\u03bd) is used to refer to the writer of several Sophistic treatises. He probably lived in Athens in the last two decades of the 5th century BC, but almost nothing is known of his life.[1]/nIt has been debated since antiquity whether the writer of these Sophistic treatises was in fact none other than Antiphon the Orator, or whether Antiphon the Sophist was indeed a separate person. This remains an active scholarly controversy; of recent editors, Gagarin, and Laks and Most, believe there to be only one Antiphon, whereas G. J. Pendrick argues for the existence of two separate individuals.[2]/nThe most important of these treatises was On Truth, whose surviving fragments cover many different subjects, from astronomy and mathematics to morality and ethics.[3] Fragments have also been preserved of the treatises On Concord and Politicus; these fragments have sometimes been attributed to the Orator rather than to the Sophist.[4]/nIt is also not known for certain whether the treatise on the Interpretation of Dreams under the name of Antiphon was written by Antiphon the Sophist, or whether this was written by yet another different Antiphon. The editions of Pendrick and of Laks and Most proceed on the basis that this treatise was written by the same Antiphon as the Sophistic works.[5]/nA treatise known as On Truth, of which only fragments survive, is attributed to Antiphon the Sophist.  It is of great value to political theory, as it appears to be a precursor to natural rights theory.  The views expressed in it suggest its author could not be the same person as Antiphon of Rhamnus, since it was interpreted as affirming strong egalitarian and libertarian principles appropriate to a democracy\u2014but antithetical to the oligarchical views of one who was instrumental in the anti-democratic coup of 411 like Antiphon of Rhamnus.[6]  It's been argued that that interpretation has become obsolete in light of a new fragment of text from On Truth discovered in 1984.  New evidence supposedly rules out an egalitarian interpretation of the text.[7]/nThe following passages may confirm the strongly libertarian commitments of Antiphon the Sophist./nOn Truth juxtaposes the repressive nature of convention and law (\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2) with \"nature\" (\u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2), especially  human nature.  Nature is envisaged as requiring spontaneity and freedom, in contrast to the often gratuitous restrictions imposed by institutions:/nMost of the things which are legally just are [none the less]\u00a0... inimical to nature.  By law it has been laid down for the eyes what they should see and what they should not see; for the ears what they should hear and they should not hear; for the tongue what it should speak, and what it should not speak; for the hands what they should do and what they should not do ... and for the mind what it should desire, and what it should not desire.[8]/nRepression means pain, whereas it is nature (human nature) to shun pain./nElsewhere, Antiphon wrote: \"Life is like a brief vigil, and the duration of life like a single day, as it were, in which having lifted our eyes to the light we give place to other who succeed us.\"[9] Mario Untersteiner comments: \"If death follows according to nature, why torment its opposite, life, which is equally according to nature?  By appealing to this tragic law of existence, Antiphon, speaking with the voice of humanity, wishes to shake off everything that can do violence to the individuality of the person.\"[10] It is reported that Antiphon set up a booth in a public agora where he offered consolation to the bereaved.[11]/nAntiphon was also a capable mathematician. Antiphon, alongside his companion Bryson of Heraclea, was the first to give an upper and lower bound for the value of pi by inscribing and then circumscribing a polygon around a circle and finally proceeding to calculate the polygons' areas. This method was applied to the problem of squaring the circle./nIamblichus' Protrepticus contains a lengthy excerpt from an important early author (studied by scholars as part of the Sophistic movement), on education and political philosophy. This passage was originally identified by Friedrich Blass in 1889 as the work of Antiphon, but this attribution has not been generally accepted. This work is accordingly referred to in modern scholarship as the Anonymus Iamblichi.[12][13]", "41373980": "Maria Adelaide Sneider (6 December 1937 \u2013 1 May 1989)[1] (also known as Maria Adelaide Sneider Ludovici, her second surname being \"Ludovici\")[2] was an Italian mathematician working on numerical and mathematical analysis.

He travelled in Italy and the Levant from 1636 to 1640 and made a survey of the Great Pyramid of Giza./nHe was Gresham Professor of Geometry at Gresham College, London, and Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford University, and collected astrolabes and astronomical measuring devices (now in the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford). He was particularly interested in the study of weights and measures, and wrote a treatise on the Roman foot and denarius, and was a keen numismatist. In 1645 he attempted a reform of the Julian calendar, which was not adopted./nDuring the English Civil War he supported Charles I, who stayed at Merton College while in Oxford, but lost his academic positions at Oxford in 1647 through the animosity of Nathaniel Brent, Warden of Merton College and a Parliamentarian./nHe was born in Colemore, near Alresford, Hampshire. He was the eldest son of John Greaves, rector of Colemore, and Sarah Greaves.[2] His brothers were Nicholas Greaves, Thomas Greaves and Sir Edward Greaves, physician to Charles II./nHis father ran a school for sons of the neighbouring gentry, where Greaves began his education.[3] Aged 15, he went to Balliol College, Oxford between 1617\u20131621, gaining a B.A. degree. In 1624 he was the first of five newly elected Fellows of Merton College, becoming M.A. in 1628.[4] He began to study astronomy and oriental languages, and especially the works of the ancient eastern astronomers. In 1630 Greaves was chosen Gresham Professor of Geometry at Gresham College, London. Through his predecessor, Peter Turner, he later met archbishop William Laud, the chancellor of Oxford University and Visitor (patron) of Merton College. Laud was keen to make English editions of Greek and Arabic authors, and Greaves' later travels abroad involved collecting manuscripts and books for presentation to his new patron./nGreaves enrolled at University of Leyden in 1633, where he became friends with Jacob Golius, professor of Arabic at Leyden. He enrolled at the University of Padua in 1635 along with George Ent, meeting the Dane Johan Rode (John Rhodius), an expert on ancient weights and measures, who also made a commentary on Celsus. A brief return to England was followed by a second European journey; in 1636 he sailed via Livorno (Leghorn) to Rome, dining with Ent on 5 October at the English College, Rome; he also met William Harvey, who was entertained at the college on the 12th, Gasparo Berti, Lucas Holstenius and Athanasius Kircher./nProbably in the same month he met and consulted with the Earl of Arundel's art-collecting agent, William Petty (who dined at the college on 14 October), on the Earl's attempted acquisition of the Obelisk of Domitian, then still lying broken in the Circus of Maxentius. Though \"now it is broken into 5 stones\", he measured these and including a sketch of the obelisk as hypothetically repaired in his almanac-notebook (Bodleian Library Savile MS 49,1). Though Arundel paid a 60 crown deposit for the obelisk, pope Urban VIII vetoed its export and it was erected by his successor Innocent X above Bernini's Fountain of the Four Rivers in the Piazza Navona.[5]/nGreaves toured the Catacombs and made drawings of the Pantheon and Pyramid of Cestius. During his stay in Rome he instituted inquiries into the ancient weights and measures that are among the early classics of metrology./nIn 1637 he made a journey to the Levant, one intention being to fix the latitude of Alexandria where Ptolemy had made his astronomical observations. He sailed from England to Livorno in the company of Edward Pococke; after a brief visit to Rome, he arrived in Istanbul (Constantinople) around April 1638. There he made the acquaintance of the English ambassador Sir Peter Wyche. He procured various manuscripts there, including a copy of Ptolemy's Almagest (\"the fairest work I ever saw\").[6] Greaves ended up owning two copies of the Almagest. He was going to have visited the many monastic libraries at Mount Athos, in order to make a catalogue of their MSS and unprinted books. Athos was normally open only to members of the Orthodox church, but thanks to a special dispensation from the Patriarch of Constantinople Cyril Lucaris, Greaves would have had access; but the execution of the patriarch by strangulation in June 1638 for treason against Sultan Murad IV prevented his journey.[4]/nInstead, Greaves continued on to Alexandria, where he collected a number of Arabic, Persian and Greek manuscripts.[7] He was an inveterate note-taker, making countless observations in notebooks and on blank pages of other books he bought; he also visited Cairo twice, and made a more accurate survey of the pyramids of Egypt than any traveller who had preceded him. He returned to England in 1640./nOn the death of John Bainbridge in 1643, Greaves was appointed as Savilian professor of astronomy and senior reader of the Linacre lecture at Oxford,[8] but he was deprived of his Gresham professorship for having neglected its duties. In 1645 he essayed a reformation of the Julian calendar; but although his plan of omitting the bissextile day (29 February) for the next 40 years was approved by the king, the matter was dropped owing to the turbulent times.[citation needed] The Gregorian calendar was not adopted in Britain until 1752./nIn 1642 Greaves had been elected subwarden of Merton College. Merton was the only Oxford college to side with the Parliamentarians in the English Civil War, through an earlier dispute in 1638 between Nathaniel Brent, the Warden of Merton, and Greaves' patron William Laud. Brent had been a witness for the prosecution at Laud's 1644 trial. After Laud was executed on 10 January 1645, Greaves drew up a petition for Brent's removal from office; Brent was deposed by Charles I on 27 January./nHowever, in 1647 a Parliamentary commission (or visitation) was set up \"for the correction of offences, abuses, and disorders\" in the University of Oxford. Nathaniel Brent was the president of the visitors.[9] After Thomas Fairfax had captured Oxford for the Parliamentarians in 1648 and Brent had returned from London, Greaves was accused of sequestrating the college's plate and funds for king Charles.[10] Despite a deposition from his brother Thomas, Greaves had lost both his Merton fellowship and his Savilian chair by 9 November 1648. Many of his books and MSS disappeared after his rooms were rifled by soldiers, although his friend John Selden managed to recover some of them.  However, Greaves was not actually deprived of the professorship until August 1649.[11]/nHe was succeeded as Savilian Professor of Astronomy in that year by Seth Ward, who ensured that Greaves was paid the arrears (\u00a3500) of his salary; Greaves was unlikely to have got his money, since the Savilian professors were paid from the income of lands held in Kent and Essex, which were under control of Parliament (rather than the king). Ward also gave over a considerable amount of his own salary to Greaves.[12]/nBut Greaves' private fortune more than sufficed for all his wants till his death; he retired to London, married and occupied his leisure writing and editing books and manuscripts. He died in London aged 50, and was buried in the church of St Benet Sherehog, which was destroyed during the Great Fire of London.[10]/nHis brother Nicholas Greaves was his executor.[13] He left his cabinet containing his coin collection to Sir John Marsham, and his astronomical instruments to the university, for the use of the Savilian professors.[14] Two of his astrolabes (inscribed by his brother Nicholas) are in the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford. (see External links)/nGreaves had entrusted his will to his friend and fellow-traveller in the Levant, the scholar of Arabic Edward Pococke. The will had originally stipulated that Greaves' collection of astronomical instruments (astrolabes, quadrants, telescopes etc.) was to be left to Oxford university. But by 1649 Greaves (who was staying at Sir John Marsham's house in Rochester, Kent) had become increasingly exasperated with the academic situation at Oxford since the civil war. He wrote to Pococke asking to him to send the will to blot out his gift of his instruments to the university (which had cost him more than a hundred pounds), because he \"so far despaired of any future encouragement to learning and ingenuity in Oxford.\"  Greaves repeated his request a few months later, asking Pococke to open the will and strike the words out himself.[15] Pococke seems to have eventually complied with Greaves' wishes, since after Greaves' death in 1652 his executor and brother Nicholas Greaves kept hold of his late brother's collection./nHowever, when the Commonwealth ended with the resignation of Richard Cromwell in 1659, Nicholas Greaves (in accordance with his late brother's original intent) presented the instruments - suitably inscribed - for the use of the Savilian Professors of Astronomy. They were kept in the professor's room at the top of the Eastern Tower of the Oxford Schools, now the Bodleian Library. A list of them appears in the 1697 Catalogue' of Bodleian manuscripts[16] In 1710 the collection was held in the Museum Savilianum.[14]/nThe instruments had disappeared by the 1920s when R. T. Gunther, the first curator of the Oxford Museum of the History of Science, made inquiries into their whereabouts. Gunther listed them in his Early Science in Oxford, Vol. 2: Astronomy as \"not extant\".[17] But in 1936 during the refurbishment of the University Radcliffe Observatory, he was alerted by the Savilian professor of Astronomy, H. H. Plaskett, to a chance discovery of \"certain old metal bars and plates behind some cases.\"  These turned out to be part of the missing Savilian collection, including a 6\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in (2.06\u00a0m) mural quadrant, and an astrolabe of Queen Elizabeth I which Greaves took on his 1637-40 expedition to the Middle East. Gunther wrote two articles in The Observatory on his findings, one shorter preliminary report[19] with a fuller appreciation a few months later.[20]/nThe inscriptions on four of the instruments (including Elizabeth I's astrolabe)[21] read:/nGreaves' other, smaller astrolabe didn't surface until 1971, when it was discovered by Gunther's son A.

He attended the University of Texas at Austin, where George Bruce Halsted encouraged his study of mathematics. Dickson earned a B.S. in 1893 and an M.S. in 1894, under Halsted's supervision. Dickson first specialised in Halsted's own specialty, geometry.[1]/nBoth the University of Chicago and Harvard University welcomed Dickson as a Ph.D. student, and Dickson initially accepted Harvard's offer, but chose to attend Chicago instead. In 1896, when he was only 22 years of age, he was awarded Chicago's first doctorate in mathematics, for a dissertation titled The Analytic Representation of Substitutions on a Power of a Prime Number of Letters with a Discussion of the Linear Group, supervised by E. H. Moore./nDickson then went to Leipzig and Paris to study under Sophus Lie and Camille Jordan, respectively. On returning to the US, he became an instructor at the University of California. In 1899 and at the extraordinarily young age of 25, Dickson was appointed associate professor at the University of Texas. Chicago countered by offering him a position in 1900, and he spent the balance of his career there. At Chicago, he supervised 53 Ph.D. theses; his most accomplished student was probably A. A. Albert. He was a visiting professor at the University of California in 1914, 1918, and 1922. In 1939, he returned to Texas to retire./nDickson married Susan McLeod Davis in 1902; they had two children, Campbell and Eleanor./nDickson was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1913, and was also a member of the American Philosophical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the London Mathematical Society, the French Academy of Sciences and the Union of Czech Mathematicians and Physicists. Dickson was the first recipient of a prize created in 1924 by The American Association for the Advancement of Science, for his work on the arithmetics of algebras. Harvard (1936) and Princeton (1941) awarded him honorary doctorates./nDickson presided over the  American Mathematical Society in 1917\u20131918. His December 1918 presidential address, titled \"Mathematics in War Perspective\", criticized American mathematics for falling short of those of Britain, France, and Germany:/nIn 1928, he was also the first recipient of the Cole Prize for algebra, awarded annually by the AMS, for his book Algebren und ihre Zahlentheorie./nIt appears that Dickson was a hard man:/nDickson had a major impact on American mathematics, especially abstract algebra. His mathematical output consists of 18 books and more than 250 papers. The Collected Mathematical Papers of Leonard Eugene Dickson fill six large volumes./nIn 1901, Dickson published his first book Linear groups with an exposition of the Galois field theory, a revision and expansion of his Ph.D. thesis. Teubner in Leipzig published the book, as there was no well-established American scientific publisher at the time. Dickson had already published 43 research papers in the preceding five years; all but seven on finite linear groups. Parshall (1991) described the book as follows:/nAn appendix in this book lists the non-abelian simple groups then known having order less than 1 billion. He listed 53 of the 56 having order less than 1 million. The remaining three were found in 1960, 1965, and 1967./nDickson worked on finite fields and extended the theory of linear associative algebras initiated by Joseph Wedderburn and Cartan./nHe started the study of modular invariants of a group./nIn 1905, Wedderburn, then at Chicago on a Carnegie Fellowship, published a paper that included three claimed proofs of a theorem stating that all finite division algebras were commutative, now known as Wedderburn's theorem. The proofs all made clever use of the interplay between the additive group of a finite division algebra A, and the multiplicative group A*\u00a0=\u00a0A\u00a0\u2212\u00a0{0}. Karen Parshall noted that the first of these three proofs had a gap not noticed at the time. Dickson also found a proof of this result but, believing Wedderburn's first proof to be correct, Dickson acknowledged Wedderburn's priority. But Dickson also noted that Wedderburn constructed his second and third proofs only after having seen Dickson's proof. She concluded that Dickson should be credited with the first correct proof.[4]/nDickson's search for a counterexample to Wedderburn's theorem led him to investigate nonassociative algebras, and in a series of papers he found all possible three and four-dimensional (nonassociative) division algebras over a field./nIn 1919 Dickson constructed Cayley numbers by a doubling process starting with quaternions \n\n\n\n\nH\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {H} }\n\n.[5] His method was extended to a doubling of \n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} }\n\n to produce \n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} }\n\n, and of \n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} }\n\n to produce \n\n\n\n\nH\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {H} }\n\n by A. A. Albert in 1922, and the procedure is known now as the Cayley\u2013Dickson construction of composition algebras./nDickson proved many interesting results in number theory, using results of Vinogradov to deduce the ideal Waring theorem in his investigations of additive number theory. He proved the Waring's problem for \n\n\n\nk\n\u2265\n7\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k\\geq 7}\n\n under the further condition of/nindependently of Subbayya Sivasankaranarayana Pillai who proved it for \n\n\n\nk\n\u2265\n6\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k\\geq 6}\n\n ahead of him.[6]/nThe three-volume History of the Theory of Numbers (1919\u201323) is still much consulted today, covering divisibility and primality, Diophantine analysis, and quadratic and higher forms. The work contains little interpretation and makes no attempt to contextualize the results being described, yet it contains essentially every significant number theoretic idea from the dawn of mathematics up to the 1920s except for quadratic reciprocity and higher reciprocity laws. A planned fourth volume on these topics was never written. A. A. Albert remarked that this three volume work \"would be a life's work by itself for a more ordinary man.\"", "47763755": "Ilse Clara Franziska Ipsen is a German-American mathematician who works as a professor of mathematics at North Carolina State University.

He learned of category theory while teaching a course on functional analysis for Truesdell, specifically from a problem in John L. Kelley's textbook General Topology. Lawvere found it a promising framework for simple rigorous axioms for the physical ideas of Truesdell and Walter Noll. Truesdell supported Lawvere's application to study further with Samuel Eilenberg, a founder of category theory, at Columbia University in 1960.[1]/nBefore completing the Ph.D. Lawvere spent a year in Berkeley as an informal student of model theory and set theory, following lectures by Alfred Tarski and Dana Scott. In his first teaching position at Reed College he was instructed to devise courses in calculus and abstract algebra from a foundational perspective. He tried to use the then current axiomatic set theory but found it unworkable for undergraduates, so he instead developed the first axioms for the more relevant composition of mappings of sets. He later streamlined those axioms into the Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets (1964) \n(Reprints, #11), which became an ingredient (the constant case) of elementary topos theory./nLawvere died on January 23, 2023, at the age of 85.[1]/nLawvere completed his Ph.D at Columbia in 1963 with Eilenberg. His dissertation introduced the Category of Categories as a framework for the semantics of algebraic theories. During 1964\u20131967 at the Forschungsinstitut f\u00fcr Mathematik at the ETH in Z\u00fcrich he worked on the Category of Categories and was especially influenced by Pierre Gabriel's seminars at Oberwolfach on Grothendieck's foundation of algebraic geometry. He then taught at the University of Chicago, working with Mac Lane, and at the City University of New York Graduate Center (CUNY), working with Alex Heller.  Lawvere's Chicago lectures on categorical dynamics were a further step toward topos theory and his CUNY lectures on hyperdoctrines advanced categorical logic especially using his 1963 discovery that existential and universal quantifiers can be characterized as special cases of adjoint functors./nBack in Z\u00fcrich for 1968\u201369 he proposed elementary (first-order) axioms for toposes generalizing the concept of the Grothendieck topos (see history of topos theory) and worked with the algebraic topologist Myles Tierney to clarify and apply this theory. Tierney discovered major simplifications in the description of Grothendieck \"topologies\". Anders Kock later found further simplifications so that a topos can be described as a category with products and equalizers in which the notions of map space and subobject are representable. Lawvere had pointed out that a Grothendieck topology can be entirely described as an endomorphism of the subobject representor, and Tierney showed that the conditions it needs to satisfy are just idempotence and the preservation of finite intersections. These \"topologies\" are important in both algebraic geometry and model theory because they determine the subtoposes as sheaf-categories./nDalhousie University in 1969 set up a group of 15 Killam-supported researchers with Lawvere at the head; but in 1971 it terminated the group. Lawvere was controversial for his political opinions, for example, his opposition to the 1970 use of the War Measures Act, and for teaching the history of mathematics without permission.[2] But in 1995 Dalhousie hosted the celebration of 50 years of category theory with Lawvere and Saunders Mac Lane present./nLawvere ran a seminar in Perugia, Italy (1972\u20131974) and especially worked on various kinds of enriched category.  For example, a metric space can be regarded as an enriched category. From 1974 until his retirement in 2000 he was professor of mathematics at University at Buffalo, often collaborating with Stephen Schanuel. In 1977 he was elected to the Martin professorship in mathematics for five years, which made possible the meeting on \"Categories in Continuum Physics\" in 1982. Clifford Truesdell participated in that meeting, as did several other researchers in the rational foundations of continuum physics and in the synthetic differential geometry that had evolved from the spatial part of Lawvere's categorical dynamics program.

Brocard was one of the 120,000 men under Marshal MacMahon led to Metz to free the French army of the Rhine. The French army, however, was defeated on 31 August at the Battle of Sedan, and was taken prisoner along with approximately 83,000 other combatants.[6]/nAfter Brocard was freed, he returned to his military position and continued teaching, publishing his mathematical articles in the most popular mathematical journal of that time, Nouvelles Correspondances Math\u00e9matiques (also called Nouvelles annales math\u00e9matiques).[8][9] He joined the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Math\u00e9matique de France in 1873, just a year after its founding. In 1875, he was inducted into the French Association for the Advancement of Science as well as the French Meteorological Society. He was shortly after sent to northern Africa, where he served as a military technician for the French forces stationed in Algiers, the seat of French Africa.

The positive Brocard point (sometimes known as the first Brocard point) of a Euclidean plane triangle is the interior point of the triangle for which the three angles formed by two of the vertices and the point are equal. Their common value is the Brocard angle of the triangle.[14] The Brocard circle of the triangle is a circle having a diameter of the line segment between the circumcenter and symmedian. It contains the Brocard points.[15] The Brocard triangle of a triangle is a triangle formed by the intersection of line from a vertex to its corresponding Brocard point and a line from another vertex to its corresponding Brocard point and the other two points constructed using different combinations of vertices and Brocard points. The Brocard triangle is inscribed in the Brocard circle.[16]/nBrocard published various other papers on mathematics during his time at Bar-le-duc, none of which became as well known as Etudes d'un nouveau cercle du plan du triangle.

One other achievement of his is guessing at the meaning of the cryptic title of one of Girard Desargues' papers, DALG. In his paper Analyse d'autographes et autres \u00e9crits de Girard Desargues, he surmised that it stood for Des Argues, Lyonnais, G\u00e9ometre, which is the generally accepted title.[17]/nThough Brocard made no major notable original discoveries in meteorology, he founded the Meteorological Institute in Algiers and served as a meteorological technician during his time in the French military.

This tribute in Oswald Veblen\u2019s obituary [see in \"Obituary\" below] accurately recognized Fine\u2019s role both in training American mathematicians to provide international leadership to this field and in building Princeton University\u2019s reputation in mathematics and science.  Fine\u2019s efforts contributed greatly toward making Princeton the site of Albert Einstein\u2019s first North American lectures, and eventually his home./nFine began his time as a Princeton undergraduate studying Greek and Latin, but a mathematics tutor, George B. Halstead, convinced him to switch his considerable talents to mathematics.  He ranked highest academically in his Class of 1880 for all four years, during which he caught the attention of President James McCosh. As a result, Fine was among a small group of highly talented undergraduates whom McCosh invited to his house for informal seminars and nurtured as future faculty./nAfter graduation, Fine remained at Princeton (then called the College of New Jersey) for a year of post-graduate work followed by three more years as a tutor.  Then, as Germany was the leading center of mathematics scholarship, he went to the University of Leipzig to study mathematics with Felix Klein under whom he earned his PhD in one year./nHe returned to Princeton as an Assistant Professor of Mathematics in 1885 and soon established himself as a leader in the faculty, ultimately named the Dod Professor of Mathematics in 1898.  In addition, his reputation beyond Princeton grew through publications and his role as one of the founding members of the American Mathematical Society.  However, it was reviving his undergraduate friendship with Woodrow Wilson (Class of 1879) that led to his subsequent impact on Princeton and American scholarship.  Fine, (Class of 1880), one year behind Wilson, assisted him as a junior and then succeeded him as Managing Editor of the \"Princetonian\", the campus\u2019 student newspaper.  When Wilson joined the Princeton faculty in 1890 their\nrelationship resumed, beginning a close and consequential lifelong friendship./nAfter McCosh\u2019s retirement in 1888, the College of New Jersey\u2019s new President, Francis Landey Patton, was satisfied to preside over what he called \"the best country club\" in the country.  However, the young faculty whom McCosh had nurtured, including Fine, and their allies on the Board of Trustees grew restive and pushed him out in favor of Wilson in 1902./nWilson quickly chose Fine to be his right-hand man as the Dean of the College.  They set about transforming Princeton by raising academic standards, revising the curriculum, and replacing several senior faculty members.  Wilson also convinced the Trustees to hire 50 new young faculty members he called \u2018preceptors\u2019.  The addition of this large number of young, enthusiastic junior faculty had a significant impact on the quality, focus and seriousness of Princeton at both the undergraduate and graduate school levels./nBecause Wilson lacked interest in science and mathematics, he delegated the preceptor appointments to Fine, giving him the opportunity to transform Princeton\u2019s programs in those fields.  Fine had an extraordinary ability to identify talented individuals in these fields and a commitment to promoting their careers.  His initial preceptorial appointments all went on to become respected mathematicians and when some vacancies developed, he replaced them with similar young talent.  He also recruited established American and European mathematicians.  By 1911, Princeton\u2019s Department of Mathematics ranked as one of the top three in America and had become the home of the prestigious Annals of Mathematics./nIn addition, Fine jump-started Princeton\u2019s weak science departments by recruiting some leading scientists, including mathematical physicist James Jeans [1], physicist Owen Wilnans Richardson Owen Willans Richardson, and biologist Edwin Grant Conklin Edwin Conklin.  Fine also nurtured younger scientists such as astronomer Henry Norris Russell./nFine\u2019s time was increasingly focused on administration and the controversies that eventually dragged down the Wilson presidency.  He and Wilson won one battle, gaining control of the Graduate School from Wilson\u2019s archenemy, Andrew Fleming West.  While ceremonial leadership remained with West, Fine became the dominant force in turning Princeton into a modern research university./nHowever, Wilson lost his attempt to reduce the influence of Princeton\u2019s undergraduate \u2018eating clubs\u2019 and to have the Graduate College constructed in the middle of campus. When Wilson left to enter politics, Fine became acting president in all but name, while also serving as President of the American Mathematical Society.  Although Fine had loyally supported Wilson\u2019s losing proposals and was a leading candidate to become president, he then loyally supported President John Grier Hibben for the rest of his career./nWith Hibben\u2019s ascendance, Fine became in reality what he had long been, Dean of the Departments of Science, a position he held until his death 1928.  He remained deeply loyal to Princeton, turning down offers of the presidency of M.I.T. and Johns Hopkins University as well as Wilson\u2019s offers to name him Ambassador to Germany and to the Federal Reserve Board./nFine continued teaching, publishing leading textbooks and occasional articles, and building his departments.  The Department of Mathematics\u2019 prestige led, in 1921, to it hosting Albert Einstein\u2019s first American lectures.  In the 1920s, Fine was particularly successful in raising money from the General Education Board and Rockefeller Foundation to support Princeton\u2019s growing science programs.

Baranauskas is best known as the author of the Lithuanian  poem Anyk\u0161\u010di\u0173 \u0161ilelis. He used various pseudonyms, including A.B., Bangputys, Jurksztas Smala\u016bsis, Jurk\u0161tas Smala\u016bsis, and Baronas.[2] He also wrote poetry in Polish.[3]/nBaranauskas was born to a small farmer family of Lithuanian nobility origin.[1] Early in his youth, his parents sent him to a local parochial school. After finishing his studies there, Baranauskas initially remained in the parish. As described in his diary, between the years 1841 and 1843 he learned the Polish language and between 1848 and 1851 Russian.[2] His first attempts to write poetry and rhyme in Lithuanian are to be found in his  diaries.[2]  Later he attended a bi-yearly school for communal writers in Rum\u0161i\u0161k\u0117s. There he started writing his first poems in Polish.[1]/nIn 1853, he finished school and started working as a writer and chancellor in various towns. During this period he began a relationship with the Samogitian poet Karolina Proniewska (Karolina Praniauskait\u0117)[4][5] and her family. The two shared a passion for the poetry of Adam Mickiewicz.[5] Praniauskait\u0117 suggested that Baranauskas should try to write more in Lithuanian.  In 1856, Karolina's family tried to separate the couple by sponsoring Baranauskas' entry into the Catholic Seminary of Varniai. While studying there, he began to concentrate on the development of the written Lithuanian language, and wrote a commentary on Lithuanian and Samogitian dialects Apie lietuvi\u0173 ir \u017eemai\u010di\u0173 kalb\u0105. It was the first scholarly attempt to distinguish these different Lithuanian dialects./nWhile in the seminary, Baranauskas started writing poems in Lithuanian, and from that time essentially wrote in that language. One of his earlier works written under the influence of Mickiewicz was Anyk\u0161\u010di\u0173 \u0161ilelis (The Forest/Pinewood of Anyk\u0161\u010diai). It is considered a classic work of Lithuanian literature. Literature critics consider it as a symbolic reference to Lithuanian history and language.[6] While some critics contend that Baranauskas wrote the poem in anger, in response to an assertion by his lector Alexander Gabszewicz that the Lithuanian language was not beautiful enough to write poems in,[2] others dispute this as a misinterpretation. The poem was first published in 1861, and again in 1862 in Laurynas Ivinskis' calendars./nFrom 1858 to 1862, Barnauskas studied at the Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy, receiving a master's degree in theology. Between 1863 and 1864, he studied at Munich's, Rome's, Innsbruck's and Louvain's Catholic universities./nStarting in 1871, he worked at the Kaunas Priest Seminary, and began teaching the Lithuanian language. He authored a  grammar textbook in Lithuanian, Mokslas lietuvi\u0161kosios kalbos. After Baranauskas went to Sejny, he gained a considerable reputation by being able to preach in both Polish and Lithuanian. By 1880, after he realized that the ban of printing in the Lithuanian language would not be lifted, in spite of several unofficial promises by Tsarist authorities to do so, his desire to promote the Lithuanian language slowly declined. He never ceased to believe, that Lithuanian should be developed and expanded and until his death worked on a  translation of the Bible into Lithuanian, and working 10\u201312 hours a day, succeeded to translate three fifths of the Old Testament./nIn his later years, Antanas Baranauskas, enjoyed some of the comforts of life. His beliefs were similar to the later Krajowcy group. Therefore, for the rest of his life he tried to reconcile nationalists from both - Lithuanian and Polish - sides. For that he was rather unpopular amongst the nationalists in both sides.[2]/nMost of the Lithuanians did not attend his burial, considering him a traitor of the national revival movement, mostly Russian officials and Poles attended it.[2] It was a completely different story when a monument for him was built in Sejny. Only Lithuanians attended the event, and even then paint was spilt on the monument the following night.[2]/nBefore Baranauskas, the main \"respectable\" language in the area was considered to be Polish, so Baranauskas was one of the few primary individuals responsible for re-legitimizing the Lithuanian language, and by extension, Lithuanian culture. Referring to Baranauskas in a lecture, the early 20th century Lithuanian poet Maironis once said, \"Without him, there might not be us\".[6]/nBaranauskas's home is preserved in the Anyk\u0161\u010diai Regional Park.", "58151284": "Antonio Auffinger is a Brazilian mathematician.

Traces of representations of the corresponding curves on the surfaces generate a Poisson algebra, whose Lie bracket has a topological description in terms of the intersections of curves. Furthermore, the Hamiltonian vector fields of these trace functions define flows generalizing the Fenchel\u2013Nielsen flows on Teichm\u00fcller space. This symplectic structure is invariant under the natural action of the mapping class group, and using the relationship between Dehn twists and the generalized Fenchel\u2013Nielsen flows, he proved the ergodicity of the action of the mapping class group on the SU(2)-character variety with respect to symplectic Lebesgue measure./nFollowing suggestions of Pierre Deligne, he and John Millson proved that the variety of representations of the fundamental group of a compact K\u00e4hler manifold has singularities defined by systems of homogeneous quadratic equations.

These are representations of hyperbolic ideal triangle groups to the group of holomorphic isometries of the complex hyperbolic plane such that each standard generator of the triangle group maps to a complex reflection and the products of pairs of generators to parabolics.  The space of representations for a given triangle group (modulo conjugacy) is parametrized by a half-open interval.

He was a Theatine priest, mathematician, and writer.[1][2] His work represents the ultimate achievement of Italian Baroque structural engineering, creating in stone what could be attempted today in reinforced concrete.[3]/nCamillo Guarino Guarini was born in Modena on 17 January 1624.[4] Following the chosen path of his eldest brother Eugenio, he entered the Theatine Order as a novitiate on the twenty-seventh of November, 1639 at the age of fifteen. He spent his novitiate at the monastery of San Silvestro al Quirinale in Rome, where he studied architecture, theology, philosophy and mathematics.[5] During Guarini's Roman years, Francesco Borromini and Gian Lorenzo Bernini created the buildings and sculpture which defined the Roman Baroque style. From Borromini, Guarini learned the use of complex geometry as a basis for floor plans. Borromini's second Roman church, Sant'Ivo alla Sapienza, was a star hexagon plan created by superimposing two equilateral triangles. Guarini used such a format in the presbytery dome of San Lorenzo in Turin./nUpon completion of seminary in 1647, Guarini returned to Modena where he was ordained on 17 January 1648.[4] He worked with Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione on the Church of San Vincenzo and the Theatine monastery.[6] Guarini rose quickly in the Theatine hierarchy, becoming first auditor, then superintendent of works, treasurer, lecturer in philosophy, procuratore, and finally provost in 1654. Prince Alfonso supported another candidate and Guarini was soon replaced and had to leave Modena. The next few years are poorly documented. He became a member of the Theatine House of Parma in 1656 and apparently visited Prague and Lisbon. Between 1657 and 1659 he stayed in Spain, where he studied Moorish architecture; this influenced the style of some of his buildings in Turin./nIn 1660, Guarini was appointed to a professorial position at the archiepiscopal seminary in Messina. During his tenure at the seminary, Guarini taught mathematics and philosophy and was commissioned with several architectural projects which he pursued over the next two years, including the design of the fa\u00e7ade of Santa Maria Annunziata, as well as the adjacent Convento di San Vincenzo, the Church of San Filippo and a church for the Somaschi Fathers, a religious order founded in devotional service of the poor by Gerolamo Emiliani (1486\u20131537) in 1532.[7][5] Guarini published his first literary work during his time in Messina, an elaborate political and poetic drama entitled La Piet\u00e0 Trionfante.[8] Guarini developed La Piet\u00e0 into a play that was performed by the students of the seminary. The story resembles the character play and moral allegory present in Greek myths./nIn June 1662, Guarini received word that his mother was gravely ill and swiftly departed from Sicily to Modena to stay with her at the end of her life.[4] He remained there for several months while also drafting plans for the fa\u00e7ade of the Theatine church of San Vincenzo in Modena, but the project was never executed.[4]/nGuarini was reassigned to Paris in October 1662, where he took up the building of the Church of Sainte-Anne-la-Royale, originally commissioned to Antonio Maurizio Valperga (1605\u20131688).[4] He thought poorly of Valperga's design\u2013that it would be dark, narrow and lacking in unity\u2013and presented a new design for Sainte-Anne-la-Royale in the shape of a Greek cross. He widened the four arms of the cross, creating an elegant symmetry of space in harmony with the large central dome. During the construction of Sainte-Anne-la-Royale, Guarini was appointed as a lecturer of theology at the Theatine School in Paris. His travel in France gave him the opportunity for contact with not only many Gothic cathedrals but also with the work of Desargue on projective geometry. \"It was this new geometry that supplied the scientific basis for Guarini's daring structures, particularly of domes.\"[9]/nThe construction of Sainte Anne began on the twenty-eighth of November, 1662 in a prominent site facing the Louvre on the quai of the Seine. Four years into the construction, both transepts of the church were nearing completion. Financial strains, as well as monetary and material resources became increasingly irregular, putting the project in jeopardy.[4] In a fit of resignation, Guarini sharply accused the superior of the Theatine Order of mishandling resources and abandoned the project, leaving swiftly for Turin in the autumn of 1666.[4]/nIn May 1668, Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy named him Royal Engineer and Mathematician.[4] He designed a large number of public and private buildings in Turin, including the palaces of Charles Emmanuel II[10] (as well as his sister Louise Christine of Savoy), the Royal Church of San Lorenzo (1666\u20131680), most of the Chapel of the Holy Shroud (housing the Shroud of Turin; begun in 1668 by Amedeo di Castellamonte), the Palazzo Carignano (1679\u201385), the Castle of Racconigi and many other public and ecclesiastical buildings at Modena, Messina, Verona, Vienna, Prague, Lisbon, and Paris.[6] The Palazzo Carignano is regarded as one of the finest urban palaces of the second half of the 17th century in Italy.[1] Guarini's project appears to have been influenced by Bernini's proposals for the Louvre Palace in Paris (1665) and by Borromini's San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane.[11]/nGuarini died in Milan on 6 March 1683.[4] In architecture, his successors include Filippo Juvarra, and Juvarra's pupil Bernardo Vittone.[12][13]/nGuarini wrote ten treatises on a multitude of subjects, including architecture, mathematics and astronomy.[1] In 1665, he published in Paris his Placita Philosophica (A System of Philosophy), a large mathematical-philosophical treatise divided into eight parts.[14] Guarini published this work while he was a professor of theology in Paris. It is a comprehensive, pragmatic system, spanning the fields of logic, anatomy, biology, astronomy, physics, theology and metaphysics. Guarino's Placita belongs to the school of thought usually referred to as Baroque Scholasticism. It also shares strong similarities to Nicolas Malebranche's Occasionalism.[15] The content of the Placita indicates that Guarini attentively followed scientific developments of the era. In some cases he endorsed them - for instance, Galileo\u2019s discovery that celestial objects are material and corruptible./nAlthough, following the views of Aristotle, Guarino denies the existence of a vacuum, he describes and discusses Torricelli's barometer and barometric experiment with a glass tube closed at the top and filled with mercury.[16] Guarini's Placita includes an extensive section on theoretical astronomy. He defends the Ptolemaic system dismissing both the Copernican and Tycho Brahe\u2019s systems.[2] He displays a good knowledge of modern scholarship and quotes frequently from Johannes Kepler\u2019s and Galileo's work. The French astronomer and Catholic priest Isma\u00ebl Bullialdus is also mentioned numerous times in conjunction with Kepler, particularly when discussing the eccentricity of planetary orbits. Guarino gives a lengthy description of the motion of planets and the Sun according to the geocentric model. He determines fairly accurately the distance between the Moon and the Earth and concludes that Galileo's observation of the change in lunar distance is due to a change in velocity; that when the Moon appears closer to the Earth, it moves faster.[17] Guarini attempts to discover the reason for this, using Euclidean geometry, triangulation and quadratura (quadrature), the available methods at a time that still predate the development of calculus and Newton's law of universal gravitation. Prior to the publication of Newton's Principia, Guarini theorizes that the velocity of light is a constant and the movement of light is a perturbance or wave. Guarini also theorizes that light travels from the Sun to the Earth in a vacuum (coniuncta soli est: unde vacua luce) until it reaches the atmosphere creating heat, wind and the movement of the ocean./nHis main work, entitled Euclides adauctus et methodicus (1671), is a treatise on descriptive geometry in thirty-five books. The first three books reintroduce arguments of philosophical nature already addressed in the Placita Philosophica regarding in particular the existence of indivisibles.[18] Guarini comments on the works of Bonaventura Cavalieri, praising his method of indivisibles.[19] He cites both the objections to this method used by Mario Bettinus in the Epilogus Planimetricus[20] and that of Paul Guldin in De centro gravitatis solidorum, as well as the authors who appreciated the mathematical proofs, such as Isma\u00ebl Bullialdus in De lineis spiralibus[21] and Vincenzo Viviani in De maximis et minimis.[22] Guarini's conclusion is articulated in nine points and ends with the judgment that Cavalieri did not provide an actual and evident proof because in his method he goes from one species to another: the indivisible segments (of the first species) form a surface (of the second species) and this kind of proportion between figures of different species is not permitted in geometry. In books IV-XII Guarini presents and proves the propositions set forth by Euclid in books I-VII and X of the Elements. Books XXII and XXXIII are devoted to solid geometry, the intersection of planes and the inscription of the five regular polyhedra in the sphere, a theme addressed by Euclid in his books XI, XII and XIII. In the final two books of the Euclides adauctus and in the Appendix, added to the work shortly after 1671, Guarini deals with the volumes of bodies contained by plane surfaces, such as pyramids and prisms, and by curved sufaces./nGuarini's strong mathematical background is evident in his architectural work. As he states in his Euclides adauctus et methodicus: \u00abThaumaturga Mathematicorum miraculorum insigni, vereque Regali architectura coruscat\u00bb - 'The magic of wondrous mathematicians shines brightly in the marvelous and truly regal architecture'.[9]/nIn addition to his writings on mathematics, he published a treatise entitled Il modo di misurare le fabbriche (1674) and a book on military engineering, the Trattato di fortificatione che hora si usa in Fiandra, Francia, et Italia (1676). After his death the Theatines published the Disegni d\u2019architettura civile et ecclesiastica, an engraved collection of his projects (1686). The complete treatise, his major work, the Architettura civile, was published in 1737 by Bernardo Vittone.[1] This book was widely circulated in eighteenth century Austria and Germany, contributing to the development of such architects as Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt, Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach, and Balthasar Neumann.[23]/nGuarino Guarini is the subject of a composition, Guarini, the Master, written in 2004 by Italian composer Lorenzo Ferrero.", "63459757": "Berit Stens\u00f8nes (19 February 1956 \u2013 5 June 2022)[1][2] was a Norwegian mathematician specializing in complex analysis and complex dynamics and known for her work on several complex variables.[3] She was a professor of mathematical sciences at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU),[4] and a professor emerita at the University of Michigan.[5]/nStens\u00f8nes completed her Ph.D. in 1985 at Princeton University.

Edmonds (born April 5, 1934) is an American-born and educated computer scientist and mathematician who lived and worked in Canada for much of his life. He has made fundamental contributions to the fields of combinatorial optimization, polyhedral combinatorics, discrete mathematics and the theory of computing. He was the recipient of the 1985 John von Neumann Theory Prize./nEdmonds attended Duke University before completing his undergraduate degree at George Washington University in 1957. He thereafter received a master's degree in 1960 at the University of Maryland under Bruce L. Reinhart with a thesis on the problem of embedding graphs into surfaces.[1][2] From 1959 to 1969 he worked at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (then the National Bureau of Standards), and was a founding member of Alan Goldman\u2019s newly created Operations Research Section in 1961. Goldman proved to be a crucial influence by enabling Edmonds to work in a RAND Corporation-sponsored workshop in Santa Monica, California. It is here that Edmonds first presented his findings on defining a class of algorithms that could run more efficiently. Most combinatorics scholars, during this time, were not focused on algorithms. However Edmonds was drawn to them and these initial investigations were key developments for his later work between matroids and optimization. He spent the years from 1961 to 1965 on the subject of NP versus P and in 1966 originated the conjectures NP \u2260 P and NP \u2229 coNP = P./nEdmonds's 1965 paper \u201cPaths, Trees and Flowers\u201d was a preeminent paper in initially suggesting the possibility of establishing a mathematical theory of efficient combinatorial algorithms. \nOne of his earliest and notable contributions is the blossom algorithm for constructing maximum matchings on graphs, discovered in 1961[3] and published in 1965.[4] This was the first polynomial-time algorithm for maximum matching in graphs. Its generalization to weighted graphs[5] was a conceptual breakthrough in the use of linear programming ideas in combinatorial optimization. It sealed in the importance of there being proofs, or \"witnesses\", that the answer for an instance is yes and there being proofs, or \"witnesses\", that the answer for an instance is no. In this blossom algorithm paper, Edmonds also characterizes feasible problems as those solvable in polynomial time; this is one of the origins of the Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis.[6]/nA breakthrough of the Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis, was defining the concept of polynomial time characterising the difference between a practical and an impractical algorithm (in modern terms, a tractable problem or intractable problem). Today, problems solvable in polynomial time are called the complexity class PTIME, or simply P./nEdmonds's paper  \u201cMaximum Matching and a Polyhedron with 0-1 Vertices\u201d along with his previous work gave astonishing polynomial-time algorithms for the construction of maximum matchings. Most notably, these papers demonstrated how a good characterization of the polyhedron associated with a combinatorial optimization problem could lead, via the duality theory of linear programming, to the construction of an efficient algorithm for the solution of that problem./nAdditional landmark work of Edmonds is in the area of matroids. He found a polyhedral description for all spanning trees of a graph, and more generally for all independent sets of a matroid.[7] Building on this, as a novel application of linear programming to discrete mathematics, he proved the matroid intersection theorem, a very general combinatorial min-max theorem[8][9] which, in modern terms, showed that the matroid intersection problem lay in both NP and co-NP./nEdmonds is well known for his theorems on max-weight branching algorithms[10] and packing edge-disjoint branchings[11] and his work with Richard Karp on faster flow algorithms. The Edmonds\u2013Gallai decomposition theorem describes finite graphs from the point of view of matchings. He introduced polymatroids,[8] submodular flows with Richard Giles,[12] and the terms clutter and blocker in the study of hypergraphs.[3] A recurring theme in his work[13] is to seek algorithms whose time complexity is polynomially bounded by their input size and bit-complexity.[3]/nFrom 1969 on, with the exception of 1991\u20131993, he held a faculty position at the Department of Combinatorics and Optimization at the University of Waterloo's Faculty of Mathematics where his research encompassed combinatorial optimization problems and associated polyhedra.

He had a twin brother who became a basketball coach and a sister who became an actress.[2] Lang moved with his family to California as a teenager, where he graduated in 1943 from Beverly Hills High School. He subsequently graduated with an AB from the California Institute of Technology in 1946. He then received a PhD in mathematics from Princeton University in 1951.

Later he moved into diophantine approximation and transcendental number theory, proving the Schneider\u2013Lang theorem. A break in research while he was involved in trying to meet 1960s student activism halfway caused him (by his own description) difficulties in picking up the threads afterwards. He wrote on modular forms and modular units, the idea of a \"distribution\" on a profinite group, and value distribution theory. He made a number of conjectures in diophantine geometry: Mordell\u2013Lang conjecture, Bombieri\u2013Lang conjecture, Lang\u2013Trotter conjecture, and the Lang conjecture on analytically hyperbolic varieties. He introduced the Lang map,[5] the Katz\u2013Lang finiteness theorem, and the Lang\u2013Steinberg theorem (cf. Lang's theorem) in algebraic groups./nLang was a prolific writer of mathematical texts, often completing one on his summer vacation. Most are at the graduate level. He wrote calculus texts and also prepared a book on group cohomology for Bourbaki. Lang's Algebra, a graduate-level introduction to abstract algebra, was a highly influential text that ran through numerous updated editions.  His Steele prize citation stated, \"Lang's Algebra changed the way graduate algebra is taught...It has affected all subsequent graduate-level algebra books.\"  It contained ideas of his teacher, Artin; some of the most interesting passages in Algebraic Number Theory also reflect Artin's influence and ideas that might otherwise not have been published in that or any form./nLang was noted for his eagerness for contact with students. He was described as a passionate teacher who would throw chalk at students who he believed were not paying attention. One of his colleagues recalled: \"He would rant and rave in front of his students. He would say, 'Our two aims are truth and clarity, and to achieve these I will shout in class.'\"[6] He won a Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition (1999) from the American Mathematical Society.

He attacked the 1977 Survey of the American Professoriate, an opinion questionnaire that Seymour Martin Lipset and E. C. Ladd had sent to thousands of college professors in the United States. Lang said it contained numerous biased and loaded questions.[7] This led to a public and highly acrimonious conflict as detailed in his book The File\u00a0: Case Study in Correction (1977-1979).[8]/nIn 1986, Lang mounted what the New York Times described as a \"one-man challenge\" against the nomination of political scientist Samuel P. Huntington to the National Academy of Sciences.[6] Lang described Huntington's research, in particular his use of mathematical equations to demonstrate that South Africa was a \"satisfied society\", as \"pseudoscience\", arguing that it gave \"the illusion of science without any of its substance.\" Despite support for Huntington from the Academy's social and behavioral scientists, Lang's challenge was successful, and Huntington was twice rejected for Academy membership. Huntington's supporters argued that Lang's opposition was political rather than scientific in nature.[9] Lang's detailed description of these events, \"Academia, Journalism, and Politics: A Case Study: The Huntington Case\", occupies the first 222 pages of his 1998 book Challenges.[10]/nLang kept his political correspondence and related documentation in extensive \"files\". He would send letters or publish articles, wait for responses, engage the writers in further correspondence, collect all these writings together and point out what he considered contradictions. He often mailed these files to mathematicians and other interested parties throughout the world.[2] Some of the files were published in his books Challenges[11] and The File\u00a0: Case Study in Correction (1977-1979).[8] His extensive file criticizing Nobel laureate David Baltimore was published in the journal Ethics and Behaviour in January 1993[12] and in his book Challenges.[11] Lang fought the decision by Yale University to hire Daniel Kevles, a historian of science, because Lang disagreed with Kevles' analysis in The Baltimore Case./nIn the last twelve years of his life, Lang challenged the scientific consensus on the connection between HIV and AIDS.

(b. Savona 1 May 1583 \u2013 d. Rome 23 July 1654), was an Italian Jesuit priest, who is best noted as a mathematician, astronomer and architect. He was one of the authors in controversy with Galileo Galilei on the nature of comets. His writings against Galileo were published under the pseudonym Sarsi.[1]/nGrassi was born in Savona, then part of the Republic of Genoa. He entered the novitiate of the Society of Jesus at the Church of Sant'Andrea al Quirinale in Rome in 1600. Following his profession of his first religious vows in 1603, he began studies at the Roman College, there taking courses in philosophy, theology and mathematics. Among his professors were the noted German Jesuit mathematicians, Christopher Clavius, Christoph Grienberger and Odo Van Maelcote. He continued his studies there until 1610.[2]/nIn 1614 Grassi was assigned to serve as Jesuit college in Genoa in the capacity of assistant Master of novices. He served in that position for two years, before being named as to the faculty of the Roman College as a professor of mathematics. During that period, his research focused on pure mathematics, as well as on optics and architecture. In 1617 he published a series of lectures he had given on the eye, De iride disputatio optica, under the pseudonym of  Galeazzo Mariscotto, as well as the Tractatus tres de sphera, de horologis ac de optica. He pronounced solemn vows in the Society in 1618, at which time he received Holy Orders as a priest, following which he was given the chair in mathematics. He held this position until 1628.[2]/nEarly in 1619, under the title \"De Tribus Cometis Anni MDCXVIII\", Grassi published a lecture he had given to the Collegio Romano about three comets which had appeared in the autumn of 1618.  He argued that the absence of parallax meant that the comets must be very distant from the Earth, and he suggested that they existed beyond the Moon.[3]/nGalileo received a copy of Grassi's lecture and was very angered by it. The notes he scribbled in the margin of his copy are full of insults\u2014pezzo d'asinaccio ('piece of utter stupidity'), bufolaccio ('buffoon'), villan poltrone ('wicked idiot'), balordone ('bumbling idiot').[4] Galileo responded with his Discourse on Comets, which was a rebuttal of many of the arguments, advanced by Grassi, but originally made by Tycho Brahe. It suggested that the absence of parallax with comets was due not to their great distance from the Earth, but to their probably being atmospheric effects. Galileo also maintained their paths were straight, rather than circular, as Brahe and Grassi believed.[5]:\u200a61\u200a As well as attacking Grassi, the Discourse also continued an earlier dispute with another Jesuit, Christoph Scheiner about sunspots.[6]/nGrassi replied in turn with his treatise Libra astronomica ac philosophica published under the pseudonym of Lotario Sarsi Sigensano (an anagram of Horatius Grassius Salonensis, his name in Latin). In this Grassi both noted how close the ideas in Galileo's Discourse were to those advanced by Gerolamo Cardano and Bernardino Telesio (which the Church regarded as dangerous) and set out scientific arguments and experimental test results to show that comets were definitely not optical illusions. Grassi's work provoked another furious reaction from Galileo in the shape of his 1623 work Il Saggiatore, in which he was savagely dismissive of Grassi's efforts.[2]/nIt has been suggested that Grassi was the author of an anonymous complaint to the Inquisition soon after Il Saggiatore appeared, asserting that the book advanced an atomic theory of matter, and that this conflicted with the Catholic doctrine of the Eucharist, because atomism would make transubstantiation impossible.[7] Although most scholars do not agree that Grassi was its author,[8] it is noteworthy that his second response to Il Saggiatore, the Ratio ponderum librae et simbellae (1626), contains many of the same arguments as the anonymous complaint. While Libra had focused on mainly astronomical issues, Ratio focused on doctrinal issues./nNo further arguments were published on either side by Grassi or Galileo on these matters after this.[2]/nDuring the course of his career, Grassi wrote several other scientific and technical works, including one on spheres, clocks and optics (Tractatus tres de sphera, de horologis ac de optica (1617)); another on optics (De iride disputatio optica a Galeatio Mariscotto publice habita in Collegio Romano S.I. (1617)) and one on sundials in the works of Vitruvius (In primum librum de architectura M. Vitruvii et in nonum eiusdem De horologiorum solarium descriptione duo brevissimi tractati (1624)). In the later period of his life, when he was in Genoa, he produced a number of other works, subsequently lost, including one treatise on the physics of light and another on architecture, unfinished at the time of his death. In 1644 he was also conducting experiments on atmospheric pressure based on the work of Evangelista Torricelli using a tube filled with mercury. These experiments were significant in demonstrating the inadequacy of Aristotelian physics.[2]/nHe continued to serve as Professor of Mathematics and Vice-Rector of the Roman College until 1633, when the Order transferred him to the Jesuit college in his home territory of Genoa. There he served not in a teaching capacity but as confessor, but although he no longer held a senior academic post, he continued to review and advise on a number of the Order's scientific projects. The Republic of Genoa also consulted him on naval engineering, including one for an 'unsinkable' ship. After a second period in Rome he served once again as confessor at the college in Genoa, and then as vice-rector, between 1651 and 1653.[2]/nGrassi was involved in advising on a number of building projects for the Jesuit order. His interest in architecture appears to date from 1616 when he began teaching mathematics, and at the same time assumed the title consiliarius aedificiorum (building consultant), for all the construction projects of the Jesuit order. He appears to have fulfilled thus responsibility sporadically between 1616 and 1628. After this he devoted a great deal of his time to architecture, although many of his schemes were destined never to be built. Among these was his first known design dating from 1620 and 1621 at the church of S. Ignazio near the Jesuit college of Ajaccio.[2]/nIn 1624 he made a trip to Sezze to check on progress in construction of the local college and the church of Ss. Pietro e Paolo, begun in 1601 to a design by father Giovanni De Rosis. Grassi made a number of alterations and additions to this project. In 1626 the rector of the college in Siena, invited him to take charge of the transformation of the church of San Vigilio. It was his only completely realised design, and it was a major influence on Jesuit architecture, combining excellent functional use of space with sober decoration.[2]/nAt the end of 1626 he was called to Rome to help with the building works on the church of Sant'Ignazio and in 1627 he was made prefect of its construction.[10] In 1632 he was called to Terni to assist with the building of the church of S. Lucia; and soon after, with the college of Montepulciano and a church in Viterbo.[2]/nHis architectural work was reduced after his move to Genoa in 1633, but in 1634 he began to work on the project for a new Jesuit college in the city, which was the cause of much contention between seen the Orde and the Balbi family which owned the land they wanted to build on. When he later became vice-rector of the college, he resumed work on the project, which had made little progress in the intervening years and was only eventually finished in 1664.[2]/nIn the Spring of 1645 Grassi visited Rome, where he carried out an inspection of the works on Sant'Ignazio and wrote a highly critical report, resulting in a general review of the construction that had already been completed under the direction of Antonio Sasso. Grassi was responsible for work relating to the elevation of the facade, and proposed a novel interior dome scheme to solve other problems arising from earlier departures from the original design. This was never built however, and instead installed a trompe-l'\u0153il dome painted by Andrea Pozzo.[11]", "6181429": "Sir Charles Scarborough or Scarburgh MP FRS FRCP (29 December 1615 \u2013 26 February 1694) was an English physician and mathematician.[1]/nScarborough was born in St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, Westminster, in 1615, to Edmund Scarburgh and his wife Hannah (Colonel Edmund Scarburgh, prominent Virginia colonist, was his brother), and was educated at St Paul's School, Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge (BA, 1637, MA, 1640) and Merton College, Oxford (MD, 1646).[2] While at Oxford he was a student of William Harvey, and the two would become close friends. Scarborough was also tutor to Christopher Wren, who was  his assistant for a time./nFollowing the Restoration in 1660, Scarborough was appointed physician to Charles II, who knighted him in 1669; Scarborough attended the king on his deathbed, and was later physician to James II and William and Mary. During the reign of James II, Scarborough served (from 1685 to 1687) as Member of Parliament for Camelford in Cornwall.[1]/nScarborough was an original fellow of the Royal Society. As a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, the author of a treatise on anatomy, Syllabus Musculorum, which was used for many years as a textbook,[3] and a translator and commentator on the first six books of Euclid's Elements, published in 1705. He also appeared as the subject of a poem by Abraham Cowley.[4]/nScarborough died in London on 26 February 1694 and was buried at Cranford, Middlesex. St Dunstan's Church there has a monument to him in Latin and English (as \"Scarburgh\"), erected by his widow.[5][1]", "2642486": "Guglielmo Libri Carucci dalla Sommaja (1 January 1803 \u2013 28 September 1869) was an Italian count and mathematician, who became known for his love and subsequent theft of ancient and precious manuscripts.[1] After being appointed the Inspector of Libraries in France, Libri began stealing the books he was responsible for. He fled to England when the theft was discovered, along with 30,000 books and manuscripts inside 18 trunks. In France, he was sentenced to 10 years in jail in absentia; some of the stolen works were returned when he died, but many remained missing./nHe was born on New Year's Day, 1 January 1803 in Florence, Italy. He entered the University of Pisa in 1816, starting to study law, but soon switching to mathematics. He graduated in 1820, his first works being praised by Babbage, Cauchy, and Gauss./nIn 1823, at the age of 20, he was appointed Professor of Mathematical Physics at Pisa, but did not relish teaching and the following year went on sabbatical leave, travelling to Paris. There, he became friends with many of the most prominent French mathematicians of the day, including Germain,[2] Laplace, Poisson, Amp\u00e8re, Fourier and Arago. Upon his return to Italy, he became involved in politics, conspiring with the secret society of the Carbonari to advocate a liberal constitution in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Faced with arrest and prosecution, he fled to France/nIn 1833, he became a French citizen. His friend Arago, the secretary of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences helped him obtain a professorship at the Coll\u00e8ge de France in 1833, succeeding the great mathematician Legendre. And in 1834, he was elected as assistant professor of calculus of probabilities at the Sorbonne. He was also elected to the Academy and given the L\u00e9gion d'honneur./nAlthough his friendship with Arago helped him obtain some of these prestigious posts, eventually their relationship went sour and by 1835 they had become bitter enemies. Another prominent mathematician with a dim view of Libri was Liouville; the two would attack each other at every opportunity in meetings of the Academy and Liouville expressed his poor opinion of Libri's personality and of his mathematical capacities in his correspondance.[3]/nBetween 1838 and 1841 Count Libri wrote and published a four-volume \"History of the Mathematical Sciences in Italy from the Renaissance of literature to the 17th Century\".[4] His original research was partially based on some 1800 manuscripts and books by Galileo, Fermat, Descartes, Leibniz, and other luminaries which he claimed to have collected throughout his career; in fact, some of these, as it turned out, had been stolen in Florence from the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana./nIn 1841, Libri obtained an appointment as Chief Inspector of French Libraries through his friendship with the influential French Chief of Police Fran\u00e7ois Guizot. This job, involving in part the cataloguing of valuable books and precious manuscripts allowed Count Libri to indulge his collecting passion by stealing them.  Although suspected, he was not investigated or charged. Abusing his privileges and pretending poor health (coughing, dressed in a big cape in all weathers), he managed to spend time alone in the archives of libraries across the country.  There he 'borrowed' items which were never returned./nIn 1842, he stole the Ashburnham Pentateuch at the Library of Tours. Thanks to the blind confidence of the canon Hyacinthe Olivier-Vitalis, he seized at the Inguimbertine library of Carpentras numerous documents such as the \" Works of Th\u00e9ocrite and H\u00e9siode \" (Venice, Alde, 1495) or 72 of 75 letters of Descartes to Father Mersenne (between 1837 and 1847). He did not, occasionally, hesitate to mutilate certain manuscripts: five volumes of the Peiresc fund and at least two thousand leaves so disappeared. In 1848, as France was involved in a liberal revolution and the government fell, a warrant was issued for Libri's arrest./nHowever, he received a tip-off and fled to London, shipping 18 large trunks of books and manuscripts, about 30,000 items, before doing so. In London, he was assisted by Antonio Panizzi, the Director of the British Museum Library, and was able to convince many that his problems in France had arisen because he was an Italian, not because the allegations against him had any substance./nOn 22 June 1850, he was, however, found guilty of theft by a French Court and sentenced in absentia to 10 years' imprisonment. His friend, the archaeologist and writer Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e (1803\u20131870), argued in his favour and was prosecuted for this. M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, the author among other stories and plays of \"Carmen\", had been convinced of Libri's innocence when the Count had told him that the missing French books and manuscripts must have been forgeries since the ones he had were the originals./nAlthough Libri had arrived in England with nothing but his books and manuscripts, he led a good life and acted the part of society lion. His money came from selling his books. Two large sales held in 1861 reputedly netted him over a million francs; this at a time when the average daily wage for a workman was about four francs./nIn 1868, when his health started to deteriorate, Libri returned to Florence and died in Fiesole, Italy on 28 September 1869./nSome 2,000 manuscripts which Libri had stolen in Italy and sold in London to Bertram Ashburnham, 4th Earl of Ashburnham were repurchased by the Italian Government in 1884, and are back in the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana. In 1888, the 5th Earl of Ashburnham sold a part of the documents stolen in France to the French national library including the Ashburnham Pentateuch. In June 2010, one of the stolen items, a letter from Descartes to Father Marin Mersenne, dated 27 May 1641 and concerning the publication of \u201cMeditations on First Philosophy\u201d, was discovered in the library of Haverford College in Pennsylvania. The college returned the letter to the Institut de France on 8 June 2010.[5]/nThe letter had been donated by the widow of a college alumnus in 1902, and was discovered only after a philosopher from Utrecht University in the Netherlands read about it on the Internet, and contacted the college to tell them what they had in their library; the existence of the letter had been known to philosophers, but not its contents. The letter was written by Descartes to Father Marin Mersenne who had been overseeing the publication of Descartes's Meditations on First Philosophy.[1]", "61854267": "George Pirie (19 July 1843 \u2013 21 August 1904) was a Scottish mathematician, mathematical scientist, and Reverend in the Church of Scotland.

Assuming a leading position under Said, Al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b conducted solar observations for 25 years from 1050.[9]/nHe was trained as a metalsmith and due to his skills he was nicknamed Al-Nekkach \"the engraver of metals\". His Latinized name, 'Arzachel' is formed from the Arabic al-Zarqali al-Naqqash, meaning 'the engraver'.[4]/nHe was particularly talented in geometry and astronomy. He is known to have taught and visited C\u00f3rdoba on various occasions, and his extensive experience and knowledge eventually made him the foremost astronomer of his time. Al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b was also an inventor, and his works helped to put Toledo on the intellectual center of Al-Andalus. He is also referred to in the works of Chaucer, as 'Arsechieles'.[4]/nIn the year 1085, Toledo was taken by the Christian king of Castile Alfonso VI.

He referred to Al-Zarqali as an astronomer and magician.[4] Ragio Montanous[citation needed] wrote a book in the 15th century on the advantages of the Sahifah al-Zarqalia. In 1530, the German scholar Jacob Ziegler wrote a commentary on one of al-Zarqali's works. In his \"De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium\", in the year 1530, Nicolaus Copernicus quotes the works of al-Zarqali and Al-Battani.[10]/nAl-Zarq\u0101l\u012b wrote two works on the construction of an instrument (an equatorium) for computing the position of the planets using diagrams of the Ptolemaic model.

Specifically, he corrected Ptolemy's estimate of the width of the Mediterranean Sea from 62 degrees to the correct value of 42 degrees.[10] In his treatise on the solar year, which survives only in a Hebrew translation, he was the first to demonstrate the motion of the solar apogee relative to the fixed background of the stars. He measured its rate of motion as 12.04 arcseconds per year, which is remarkably close to the modern calculation of 11.77 arcseconds.[14]  Al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b's model for the motion of the Sun, in which the center of the Sun's deferent moved on a small, slowly rotating circle to reproduce the observed motion of the solar apogee, was discussed in the thirteenth century by Bernard of Verdun[15] and in the fifteenth century by Regiomontanus and Peurbach. In the sixteenth century Copernicus employed this model, modified to heliocentric form, in his De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium.[16]/nAl-Zarq\u0101l\u012b also contributed to the famous Tables of Toledo, an adaptation of earlier astronomical data by Al-Khwarizmi and Al-Battani, to locate the coordinates of Toledo.[9] His zij and almanac were translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona in the 12th century, and contributed to the rebirth of a mathematically based astronomy in Christian Europe and were later incorporated into the Tables of Toledo in the 12th century and the Alfonsine tables in the 13th century.[17]/nFamous as well for his own Book of Tables, of which many had been compiled. Al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b's almanac contained tables which allowed one to find the days on which the Coptic, Roman, lunar, and Persian months begin, other tables which give the position of planets at any given time, and still others facilitating the prediction of solar and lunar eclipses.[18] This almanac that he compiled directly provided \"the positions of the celestial bodies and need no further computation\", it further simplifies longitudes using planetary cycles of each planet.[9] The work provided the true daily positions of the sun for four Julian years from 1088 to 1092, the true positions of the five planets every 5 or 10 days over a period of 8 years for Venus, 79 years for Mars, and so forth, as well as other related tables.[17][19]/nIn designing an instrument to deal with Ptolemy's complex model for the planet Mercury, in which the center of the deferent moves on a secondary epicycle, al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b noted that the path of the center of the primary epicycle is not a circle, as it is for the other planets. Instead it is approximately oval and similar to the shape of a pignon (or pine nut).[20]  Some writers have misinterpreted al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b's description of an earth-centered oval path for the center of the planet's epicycle as an anticipation of Johannes Kepler's sun-centered elliptical paths for the planets.[21] Although this may be the first suggestion that a conic section could play a role in astronomy, al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b did not apply the ellipse to astronomical theory and neither he nor his Iberian or Maghrebi contemporaries used an elliptical deferent in their astronomical calculations.[22]/nMajor works and publications:", "33935937": "Niels Nielsen (2 December 1865, in \u00d8rslev \u2013 16 September 1931, in Copenhagen) was a Danish mathematician who specialised in mathematical analysis./nNielsen was the son of humble peasants and grew up in the western part of the island of Funen.

He pioneered the modern applications of probability theory, including the harnessing of very small correlations for reliable financial gain./nThorp is the author of Beat the Dealer, which mathematically proved that the house advantage in blackjack could be overcome by card counting.[1] He also developed and applied effective hedge fund techniques in the financial markets, and collaborated with Claude Shannon in creating the first wearable computer.[2]/nThorp received his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1958, and worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 1959 to 1961.  He was a professor of mathematics from 1961 to 1965 at New Mexico State University, and then joined the University of California, Irvine where he was a professor of mathematics from 1965 to 1977 and a professor of mathematics and finance from 1977 to 1982.[3]/nThorp was born in Chicago, but moved to southern California in his childhood. He had an early aptitude for science, and often tinkered with experiments of his own creation. He was one of the youngest amateur radio operators when he was certified at age 12. Thorp went on to win scholarships by doing well in chemistry and physics competitions (one instance led him to meeting President Truman), ultimately electing to go to UC Berkeley for his undergraduate degree. However, he transferred to UCLA after one year, majoring in physics. This was eventually followed by a PhD in Mathematics at UCLA. He met his future wife Vivian during his first year at UCLA. They married in January 1956./nThorp used the IBM 704 as a research tool in order to investigate the probabilities of winning while developing his blackjack game theory, which was based on the Kelly criterion, which he learned about from the 1956 paper by Kelly.[4][5][6][7]  He learned Fortran in order to program the equations needed for his theoretical research model on the probabilities of winning at blackjack. Thorp analyzed the game of blackjack to a great extent this way, while devising card counting schemes with the aid of the IBM 704 in order to improve his odds,[8] especially near the end of a card deck that is not being reshuffled after every deal./nThorp decided to test his theory in practice in Reno, Lake Tahoe,  and Las Vegas, Nevada.[6][8][9]\nThorp started his applied research using $10,000, with Manny Kimmel, a wealthy professional gambler and former bookmaker,[10] providing the venture capital. First they visited Reno and Lake Tahoe establishments where they tested Thorp's theory at the local blackjack tables.[9] The experimental results proved successful and his theory was verified since he won $11,000 in a single weekend.[6] As a countermeasure to his methods, casinos now shuffle long before the end of the deck is reached. During his Las Vegas casino visits Thorp frequently used disguises such as wraparound glasses and false beards.[9] In addition to the blackjack activities, Thorp had assembled a baccarat team which was also winning.[9]/nNews quickly spread throughout the gambling community, which was eager for new methods of winning, while Thorp became an instant celebrity among blackjack aficionados. Due to the great demand generated about disseminating his research results to a wider gambling audience, he wrote the book Beat the Dealer in 1966, widely considered the original guide to card counting,[11] which sold over 700,000 copies, a huge number for a specialty title which earned it a place in the New York Times bestseller list, much to the chagrin of Kimmel whose identity was thinly disguised in the book as Mr. X.[6]/nThorp's blackjack research[12] is one of the very few examples where results from such research reached the public directly, completely bypassing the usual academic peer review process cycle. He has also stated that he considered the whole experiment an academic exercise.[6]/nIn addition, Thorp, while a professor of mathematics at MIT, met Claude Shannon, and took him and his wife Betty Shannon as partners on weekend forays to Las Vegas to play roulette and blackjack, at which Thorp was very successful.[13] His team's roulette play was the first instance of using a wearable computer in a casino \u2014 something which is now illegal, as of May 30, 1985, when the Nevada devices law came into effect as an emergency measure targeting blackjack and roulette devices.[2][13] The wearable computer was co-developed with Claude Shannon between 1960 and 1961. It relied on a pair of operators, where one would watch the wheel and use his toe to input the cadence of the wheel, and the other would receive a message in the form of musical tones through a hidden earpiece. By betting on groups of neighboring numbers on the wheel they could gain a sufficient advantage to make a profit. The final operating version of the device was tested in Shannon's home lab at his basement in June 1961.[2] Based on his achievements, Thorp was an inaugural member of the Blackjack Hall of Fame.[14]/nHe also devised the \"Thorp count\", a method for calculating the likelihood of winning in certain endgame positions in backgammon.[15]/nEdward O. Thorp's Real Blackjack was published by Villa Crespo Software in 1990.[16]/nSince the late 1960s, Thorp has used his knowledge of probability and statistics in the stock market by discovering and exploiting a number of pricing anomalies in the securities markets and has made a significant fortune.[5] Thorp's first hedge fund was Princeton/Newport Partners from 1969 to 1989 based on Market Neutral Derivatives Hedging. His second hedge fund was called Ridgeline Partners and it ran from August 1994 through September 2002 based on statistical arbitrage.[13] This hedge fund was closed largely because the return of the statistical arbitrage strategies had been low since 2002.  He is currently the President of Edward O. Thorp & Associates, based in Newport Beach, California. In May 1998, Thorp reported that his personal investments yielded an annualized 20 percent rate of return averaged over 28.5 years.[17]/nEd Thorp wrote many articles about option pricing, Kelly criterion, statistical arbitrage strategies (6-parts series),[18] and inefficient markets.[19]/nIn 1991, Thorp was an early skeptic of Bernie Madoff's supposedly stellar investing returns which were proved to be fraudulent in 2008.[20]", "53924453": "Valentine Joseph (27 January 1929 \u2013 15 March 2017) was a Sri Lankan Tamil mathematician, noted for his contributions to education.[2][3][4]/nJoseph was born in Penang, Malaya to Sri Lankan Tamil parents.

Reportedly an intensely private man and a keen cyclist, Williams was due to return to Cheltenham at the beginning of September 2010, following his annual leave.[10]/nPolice visited Williams's home during the afternoon of Monday 23 August 2010, as a \"welfare check\" after colleagues noted he had been out of contact for several days.[11] His naked, decomposing remains were found in the bath of the main bedroom's en-suite bathroom, inside a red bag that was padlocked from the outside, with the keys inside the bag.[12][13] The police had gained entry into his top floor flat in Alderney Street, Pimlico at around 16:40.[14] His family alleged that crucial DNA was interfered with and that fingerprints left at the scene were wiped off as part of a cover-up.[1] Inconclusive fragments of DNA components from at least two other contributors were found on the bag.[15] A forensic examination of Williams's flat, a security service safe house, has concluded that there was no sign of forced entry or DNA that pointed to a third party present at the time of the spy's death./nScotland Yard's inquiry also found no evidence of Williams's fingerprints on the padlock of the bag or the rim of the bath, which the coroner said supported her assertion of \"third-party involvement\" in the death. Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt said it was theoretically possible for Williams to lower himself into the bag without touching the rim of the bath.[16] A key to the padlock was inside the bag, underneath his body.[17]/nWilliams was buried at Ynys Wen cemetery in Valley, Anglesey, on 26 September 2010, following a private funeral service at Bethel Chapel in Holyhead attended by his family, friends, former colleagues in the intelligence services, and also by the head of SIS, Sir John Sawers.[18][19][20]/nWilliams's date of death was estimated to have been in the early hours of 16 August, one week before he was found.[21]/nSoon after the investigation started, the heads of the Secret Intelligence Service and Metropolitan Police met to discuss how the police would handle the investigation in light of the top secret nature of Williams's work, and who would lead the investigation.  Williams had recently qualified for operational deployment, and had worked with U.S. National Security Agency and FBI agents. The U.S. State Department asked that no details of Williams's work should emerge at the inquest. The Foreign Secretary, William Hague, signed a public-interest immunity certificate authorising the withholding from the inquest of details of Williams's work and U.S. joint operations.[18]/nAfter launching an investigation, coroner Fiona Wilcox said that there were no injuries on his body and no signs that he had been involved in a struggle; his body was also free of alcohol and common recreational drugs.[22][23][24] The Metropolitan Police considered his death \"suspicious and unexplained\".[25] The FBI also conducted their own investigation into the case.[26]/nIn December 2010, police released further details, stating that Williams had occasionally spent between 30 minutes and an hour on bondage websites, but added there was no evidence that he was \"obsessed\" with bondage and no other pornography was found. Williams's wardrobe included \u00a325,000 of \"high-end\" women's clothing.[27]/nThe landlady of the annex flat he had rented in Cheltenham for 10 years said she and her husband had once found him, three years before his death, shouting for help, with his hands tied to his bedposts. He said he was seeing if he could get free. They cut him free, believing it was \"sexual rather than escapology\".[28]/nAn expert brought in to examine the bag in which Williams's body was found concluded that Williams could not have locked it. A police spokesperson stated that: \"If he was alive, he got into it voluntarily or, if not, he was unconscious and placed in the bag.\"[29]/nThe heating in Williams's apartment was found to be turned on.[28] It has been suggested an elevated temperature inside the apartment would have sped up the decomposition of Williams's body.[30]/nSubsequently, the police released an E-FIT photo of two people they were seeking, who were seen to enter the communal entrance of his home in June or July 2010.[29]/nThe lawyer for the family, Anthony O'Toole, at the Coroner's inquest in March 2012, said that a second person was either present when Williams died, or someone broke in afterwards and stole items.  There was no forensic evidence to support this view. No sign of forced entry could be found, but it was also noted that the door and locks had been removed by the time police experts had become involved./nDNA found on Williams's hand turned out to be contamination from one of the forensic scientists and the police determined that a Mediterranean couple they had been seeking had nothing to do with the inquiry.[31] LGC, the forensic company, apologized that the error had inflicted such pain on the family, caused by the incorrect data entry of a numerical code.[1]/nEvidence at the inquest showed that it would have been virtually impossible for Williams to have locked himself in the bag.[32] Two experts were unable to lock themselves in a similar bag despite making 400 attempts to do so, although one stated there was a small chance Williams had managed the feat.[28] Pathologist Richard Shepherd stated it was more likely that Williams was alive when he got into the bag, due to the difficulty of arranging a corpse in the position Williams's body was found in. Another pathologist stated that Williams would have been overcome by hypercapnia, elevated carbon dioxide levels, after only two or three minutes in the bag.[28] There were no gloves found in the bag and no fingerprints on either the padlock nor indeed the bag.[16]/nWilliams's family said they believed that they suspected this person \u201cwas a member of some agency specialising in the dark arts of the secret services\u201d.[33]/nFiona Wilcox, the coroner, said that she would \"follow the evidence\" wherever it led.[1] Fiona Wilcox was also the coroner for the death of William Broeksmit who was an auditor at Deutsche Bank at the time the bank was underwriting the Danske/Estonia Russian money laundering operation.[34]/nJournalist Duncan Campbell reported that the inquest evidence indicated Williams was one of a team of intelligence officers sent to penetrate US and UK hacking networks. He had attended the 2010 Black Hat Briefings and DEF CON conferences. He had started with SIS in London in spring 2009, and after taking a number of training courses started on \"active operational work\".[9] A few months before his death, he asked to return to GCHQ as he disliked the \"rat race, flash car competitions and post-work drinking culture\" at SIS and as a keen cyclist and walker wanted to go back to the countryside, and was due to return in September.[35]/nThe coroner found in a narrative verdict that Williams's death was \"unnatural and likely to have been criminally mediated\". The coroner was \"satisfied that on the balance of probabilities that Gareth was killed unlawfully\". There was insufficient evidence to give a verdict of unlawful killing. The coroner concluded that another party placed the bag containing Williams into the bath, and on the balance of probabilities locked the bag. The coroner said that Williams was probably alive when he was put in the bag and that he probably died shortly afterwards from CO2 poisoning or from a short-acting poison.[2] No fingerprints were found around the bath nor the bag.

After developing interests in reading and mathematics, he opened a school near Carlisle. Under the patronage of Edmund Law, Bishop of Carlisle, he was appointed master at the Carlisle Grammar School. A love affair forced him to abandon a plan to become a priest of the Church of England,[1] and instead when the bishop's son John Law was appointed bishop of Clonfert in 1782 Howard became his steward.

On the strength of his Second Spira he is also now credited as a Christian Cartesian philosopher.[1]/nHe kept in 1694 a mathematical school in Adam's Court, Broad Street, near the Royal Exchange, London. John Dunton the publisher, learning of him and his skill in mathematics, supplied him with literary work. When the notion of establishing The Athenian Mercury occurred to Dunton, he sought Sault's aid as joint editor and contributor. The first number came out on 17 March 1691, and the second on 24 March. Before the third number Dunton and Sault had joined to them Dunton's brother-in-law, Samuel Wesley. There are Articles of agreement between Sam.

Thirty thousand copies of the Second Spira sold in six weeks. It is one of the seven books which Dunton repented printing, because he came to the conclusion that Sault was only depicting his own mental and moral experiences. He printed in his memoirs a letter from Sault's wife, in which she accused her husband of loose living, as some proof of Sault's extramarital sex life, arguing this as a cause of his mental troubles./nWilliam Leybourne's Pleasure with Profit (London, 1694) contains, as an appendix, Sault's A Treatise of Algebra (52pp), in which Sault's pays special attention to Joseph Raphson's recent (1690) treatment of Converging Series for all manner of adfected equations, but prefaced by Sault's own notion of punctation of series (there is no explicit contribution from Raphson) . It is unclear what relationship there might have been between Sault and Raphson, but the issue of Memoirs for the Ingenious for July, 1693 contains an exchange of letters on geometrically-inspired speculation of the sort Raphson treated in De Spatio Reali (1697) and Demonstratio de Deo (1710), followed by a letter dedicated to the Honoured Joseph Raphson, FRS; the case of worms on the tongue mentioned in this latter letter was then taken up in correspondence in Philosophical Transactions in 1694 (where, however, Raphson is given as Ralphson, as also in Edmund Halley's paper in the same volume).

He was one of a group of astronomers in the north of England who followed the astronomy of Johannes Kepler, which included Jeremiah Horrocks and William Crabtree./nGascoigne was born in Middleton, Leeds in 1612, the son of a minor country gentleman. His father was Henry Gascoigne, Esq., of Thorpe-on-the-Hill in the parish of Rothwell, near Leeds, Yorkshire. His mother was Margaret Jane, daughter of William Cartwright. Little is known of his early life. He claimed he was educated at the University of Oxford, although no record of this has been found.[1]/nIn the late 1630s, Gascoigne, was working on a Keplerian optical arrangement when a thread from a spider's web happened to become caught at exactly the combined optical focal points of the two lenses. When he looked through the arrangement Gascoigne saw the web bright and sharp within the field of view. He realized that he could more accurately point the telescope using the line as a guide, and went on to invent the telescopic sight by placing crossed wires at the focal point to define the centre of the field of view.[2][3] He then added this arrangement to a sextant modelled on the instrument used by Tycho Brahe, although Tycho's sextant was only a naked-eye instrument. Gascoigne's sextant was five feet in radius, and measured the distance between astronomical bodies to an unprecedented degree of accuracy. Gascoigne then realised that by introducing two points, whose separation could be adjusted using a screw, he could measure the size of the image enclosed by them. Using the known pitch of the screw, and knowing the focal length of the lens producing the image, he could work out the size of the object, such as the Moon or the planets, to a hitherto unattainable degree of accuracy.[1][4]/nGascoigne met the Lancashire astronomer William Crabtree, probably in 1640. After making observations at Gascoigne's home, Crabtree was much taken with these inventions and immediately saw their significance. On his return to his home in Broughton, just outside Manchester, he wrote to Gascoigne asking if he might obtain such instruments and also wrote to his friend Jeremiah Horrocks about them. He wrote again to Gascoigne on 28 December 1640 saying,/nMy friend Mr. Horrox professeth that little touch which I gave him hath ravished his mind quite from itself and left him in an Exstasie between Admiration and Amazement. I beseech you Sir, slack not your Intentions for the Perfection of your begun Wonders./nSadly, Horrocks died before he could try out the instruments, but Crabtree and Gascoigne did use them to try to corroborate Horrocks's theories about the elliptical orbit of the Moon.[1]/nThis invention was later taken up and improved by the scientist and astronomer Richard Towneley who was the nephew of Gascoigne's friend Christopher Towneley. Towneley later brought the instrument to the attention of Robert Hooke, who used it to calculate the size of comets and other celestial bodies. The micrometer, as it became known, was to lie at the heart of astronomical measurement down to the twentieth century.[5][4]/nIn 1642, civil war broke out in England, and Gascoigne received a commission as Providore for Yorkshire in the army of King Charles I.

Shannon Award, the IEEE Computer Society Charles Babbage Award, the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal (1989)[4] and with Gustave Solomon, the 1995 IEEE Masaru Ibuka Award. In 1998 Reed received a Golden Jubilee Award for Technological Innovation from the IEEE Information Theory Society.[5]/nThe University of Southern California graduate school of electrical engineering required doctoral students to pass an oral screening exam, in which there were eight categories of test questions. Reed always asked the questions about electromagnetism and specifically Maxwell's equations, which he obviously viewed as fundamental to communication theory./nWhile a student in mathematics at the California Institute of Technology, Reed did not complete his required physical education courses due to time pressure and was set to enter the Navy. The only way he could graduate was to obtain a special release from Robert A. Millikan, the university's president and a former physical education instructor as well as a Nobel Prize winner and a noted hard-liner on the physical education requirement. As Reed was in Millikan's office pleading his case, he saw reprints of two papers he had published as an undergraduate on the president's table and drew them to Millikan's attention. Millikan smiled and said \"You seem to me a healthy young man. I believe you will do well in the service of your country as a graduate of the California Institute of Technology.\"/nReed and colleagues demonstrated the MADDIDA computer to John von Neumann at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.

She received a master's degree from Cornell University in 1924 after completing her thesis on \"A Special Function of One Variable.\" She then went on to achieve her doctorate from Cornell in 1927, completing her thesis on the \"Riesz Summability for Double Series\" (published in Transactions of the American Mathematical Society in 1928)[M28] with thesis advisor Wallie Abraham Hurwitz.[1]/nMears's first job as a college professor was at the Women's College of Alabama; she soon left to become an associate professor of mathematics at Pennsylvania State College, and then joined The George Washington University in 1929.[2][1]/nAt George Washington University, Mears was known for her popularity among both her students and fellow faculty members.[1] She was considered by the university's president as \"one of the greatest teachers of mathematics in the entire country.\" During her first year at The George Washington University, Mears taught as an assistant professor of mathematics in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences. Her office could be found directly on campus at 2033 G Street. At the beginning of her career at GW, Mears was the only woman in the Mathematics department, which included seven other professors. Additionally, it was reported that she was paid substantially less than her male co-workers./nMears earned the title of being a master teacher.[3] According to the criteria set by the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, Mears earned this title due to her excellent teaching skills, and her contributions in both research and the Mathematics Department. Among the many classes that she taught were Advanced Calculus, Introduction to Analysis, Introduction to Infinite Series, and Fourier Series and Spherical Harmonics. In 1955, George Washington University awarded her an Alumni Citation for twenty-five years of distinguished service. In 1958, the University of California selected her as one of ten female mathematicians to work on a project studying creativity. In 1962, she became a member of an examining committee, which focused on selecting doctoral dissertations in mathematics for the University of Allahabad in India./nMears specialized in the findings of definitions and values assigned to various infinite series of numbers. An \"infinite series\" is an endless series of numbers, each succeeding the other that is a certain amount lesser or greater than the proceeding one. An example set of an infinite series includes is 1 + \u00bd + \u00bc etc. in which the definition of the series can be defined as the number two. As a result, Mears created several theorems about these definitions, many of which provided truth for many practicing mathematicians, engineers, chemists, physicists, and astronomers. One of her most popular theorems, called the Norlund Mean can be explained through absolute regularity, the summability of Cauchy products, and inverse properties./nMears' participation in professional, honorary, and civic organizations included a professional membership in the American Math Society, and in the American Math Association. Her various honorary memberships included the Washington Academy of Science, Phi Beta Kappa (1927), Phi Kappa Phi (1927),[4] and Sigma XI (1924). Additionally, she held several fellowships at Cornell University during the years 1925 to 1927. Mears also published several articles and book reviews in leading mathematical journals./nMears helped Janos Edvard Hanson and Joseph Blum earn their Ph.D.s from the George Washington University.[5][6] Joseph Blum earned his Ph.D. in 1958 following his completion of his dissertation on Banach Spaces Functionals and Matrix Summability Method. Two years later, Mears would also aid Janos Edvard Hanson in earning his Ph.D. in 1960, after writing his final dissertation on Linear Sequence Spaces, which permit omission and adjunction and have Finite Dimension Modulo Convergence.[7]/nMears was named professor emerita of Mathematics in 1965. A professor emeritus or emeritus professor is a title that may be given to a full professor who retires in good standing. According to the American Council on Education it is typically awarded for \"long and distinguished service\".  She is considered not only one of The George Washington University's greatest mathematicians, but also one of the finest and most active mathematicians in the United States of America. Mears died on December 3, 1995.[1]", "48583314": "Dorothy Jean Johnson Vaughan (September 20, 1910 \u2013 November 10, 2008) was an American mathematician and human computer who worked for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), and NASA, at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. In 1949, she became acting supervisor of the West Area Computers, the first African-American woman to receive a promotion and supervise a group of staff at the center./nShe later was promoted officially to the position of supervisor. During her 28-year career, Vaughan prepared for the introduction of computers in the early 1960s by teaching herself and her staff the Fortran programming language. She later headed the programming section of the Analysis and Computation Division (ACD) at Langley./nVaughan is one of the women featured in Margot Lee Shetterly's history Hidden Figures: The Story of the African-American Women Who Helped Win the Space Race (2016). It was adapted as a biographical film of the same name, also released in 2016./nIn 2019, Vaughan was honored with the Congressional Gold Medal posthumously.[1]/nVaughan was born September 20, 1910, in Kansas City, Missouri, as Dorothy Jean Johnson.[2] She was the daughter of[3] Annie and Leonard Johnson. At the age of seven, her family moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, where she graduated from Beechurst High School in 1925 as her class valedictorian.[4] Vaughan received a full-tuition scholarship from West Virginia Conference of the A.M.E. Sunday School Convention[5] to attend Wilberforce University in Wilberforce, Ohio. She joined the Zeta chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority at Wilberforce[6] and graduated in 1929 with a B.A. in mathematics.[7] In 1932, she married Howard Vaughan, who died in 1955. The couple moved to Newport News, Virginia, where they had six children: Ann, Maida, Leonard, Kenneth, Michael and Donald.[8] The family also lived with Howard's wealthy and respected parents and grandparents on South Main Street in Newport News, Virginia. Vaughan was very devoted to family and the church, which would play a huge factor in whether she would move to Hampton, Virginia, to work for NASA./nVaughan graduated from Wilberforce University in 1929. Although encouraged by professors to do graduate study at Howard University,[5] Vaughan worked as a mathematics teacher at Robert Russa Moton High School in Farmville, Virginia, in order to assist her family during the Great Depression.[9] During the 14 years of her teaching career, Virginia's public schools and other facilities were still racially segregated under Jim Crow laws.[10]/nIn 1935, the NACA had established a section of women mathematicians, who performed complex calculations.[5] In 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, to desegregate the defense industry, and Executive Order 9346 to end racial segregation and discrimination in hiring and promotion among federal agencies and defense contractors.[10] These helped ensure the war effort drew from all of American society after the United States entered World War II in 1941. With the enactment of the two Executive Orders, and with many men being swept into service, federal agencies such as the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) also expanded their hiring and increased recruiting of women, including women of color, to support the war production of airplanes.[5] Two years following the issuance of Executive Orders 8802 and 9346, the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory (Langley Research Center), a facility of the NACA, began hiring more black women to meet the drastic increase in demand for processing aeronautical research data.[2] The US believed that the war was going to be won in the air. It had already ramped up airplane production, creating a great demand for engineers, mathematicians, craftsmen and skilled tradesmen./nIn 1943, Vaughan began a 28-year-career as a mathematician and programmer at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, in which she specialized in calculations for flight paths, the Scout Project, and  computer programming. Her career in this field kicked off during the height of World War II. She came to the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory thinking that it would be a temporary war job. One of her children later worked at NACA.[7] Vaughan was assigned to the West Area Computing, a segregated unit, which consisted of only African Americans. This was due to prevailing Jim Crow laws that required newly hired African American women to work separately from their white women counterparts.[2] They were also required to use separate dining and bathroom facilities.[2] This segregated group consisted of African-American women who made complex mathematical calculations by hand, using tools of the time.[5][11]/nThe West Computers made contributions to every area of research at Langley. Their work expanded in the postwar years to support research and design for the United States' space program, which was emphasized under President John F. Kennedy. In 1949, Vaughan was assigned as the acting head of the West Area Computers, taking over from a white woman who had died. She was the first black supervisor at NACA and one of few female supervisors. She led a group composed entirely of African-American women mathematicians.[12] She served for years in an acting role before being promoted officially to the position as supervisor.[9] Vaughan worked for opportunities for the women in West Computing as well as women in other departments.[11]/nSeeing that machine computers were going to be the future, she taught the women programming languages and other concepts to prepare them for the transition. Mathematician Katherine Johnson was initially assigned to Vaughan's group, before being transferred to Langley's Flight Mechanics Division. Vaughan moved into the area of electronic computing in 1961, after NACA introduced the first digital (non-human) computers to the center. Vaughan became proficient in computer programming, teaching herself FORTRAN and teaching it to her coworkers to prepare them for the transition. She contributed to the space program through her work on the Scout Launch Vehicle Program.[11] A blog describing her work at NASA is on the Science Museum group website[13]/nVaughan continued after NASA, the successor agency, was established in 1958. When NACA became NASA, segregated facilities, including the West Computing office, were abolished. In a 1994 interview, Vaughan recalled that working at Langley during the Space Race felt like being on \"the cutting edge of something very exciting\".[14]  Regarding being an African American woman during that time in Langley, she remarked, \"I changed what I could, and what I couldn't, I endured.\" Vaughan worked in the Numerical Techniques division through the 1960s. Dorothy Vaughan and many of the former West Computers joined the new Analysis and Computation Division (ACD), a racially and gender-integrated group on the frontier of electronic computing. She worked at NASA-Langley for 28 years.[12]/nDuring her career at Langley, Vaughan was also raising her six children, one of whom later also worked at NASA-Langley. Vaughan lived in Newport News, Virginia, and commuted to work at Hampton via public transportation./nVaughan wanted to continue at another management position at NASA, but never received an offer.[15] She retired from NASA in 1971, at the age of 61. In her final years, she worked with mathematicians Katherine G. Johnson and Mary Jackson on astronaut John Glenn's launch into orbit.[15] She died on November 10, 2008, aged 98. Vaughan was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, an African-American sorority. She was also an active member of the African Methodist Episcopal Church where she participated in music and missionary activities. She also wrote a song called \"Math Math\".[16]/nAt the time of her passing, she was survived by four of her six children, ten grandchildren and fourteen great-grandchildren.[8]/nVaughan was the first respected Black female manager at NASA, thus creating a long-lasting legacy for diversity in mathematics and science for West Area Computers. As one of the first female coders in the field who knew how to code FORTRAN, she was able to instruct other Black women on the coding language and paved a wave of female programmers to integrate their work into NASA\u2019s systems. [17]/nIn 2005, a scholarship fund with the Salem Community Foundation was created under Dorothy Vaughan\u2019s name to further music training by the Salem Music Study Club.

Ruymgaart, formulated and proved Sanov's theorem in a finer topology than had been known at the time.[5] A paper he published in 1983 on properties of Brownian motion gave rise to a large body of literature on minorants of more general stochastic processes.[6] One of the main areas of work of Groeneboom has been shape constrained statistical inference, which includes isotonic regression, an area with links to the aforementioned minorant problems,[6] as a special case. His interest in shape constrained inference began in the second half of his two-year stay at the University of Washington.[3][7] In a 1985 article on an estimator of a monotone density named after Ulf Grenander, he introduced the switching (or switch) relation, which came to be used widely in the area.[8][9] He found the analytic form of Chernoff's distribution, which later was understood to be omnipresent in monotone problems,[10] in the 1980s,[3] independently of others who worked on the problem at the same time.

Gill in the attempt to overturn the conviction of Lucia de Berk, a Dutch nurse, who had been found guilty of murdering four of her patients, and attempting to kill three others. The matter was a high-profile case in the Netherlands, notable because it depended on the probabilities of certain events.[15] They argued that statistical considerations that had led to the initial suspicions of murder, and those which had remained at the center stage of the case afterwards, were flawed. The effort was ultimately successful and de Berk was finally acquitted of all accusations in 2010.[3][4]/nFor his paper on Chernoff's distribution, written in 1984 but appearing much later in 1989, Groeneboom was awarded the Rollo Davidson Prize 1985.[11][16]/nGroeneboom is a fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and an elected member of the International Statistical Institute.

His great strength was a thorough understanding of economics and statistics, particularly the operation of labour markets and the limitations of available statistics. This set him apart from most other academic industrial relations specialists. He was an inspiring lecturer and his tutorials and post-graduate supervisions were challenging and provocative as students were prodded and persuaded into thinking.[1]/nTurner, known as Bert to family, friends, and colleagues, was born in London on 11 December 1919, the eldest son of Frederick Turner and Elizabeth May King; he had three siblings.[2] Turner's fourth marriage, to a French academic, led him to spend much of his later years in France with his family. He died in Veneux- les \u2013Sablons, near Fontainebleau, on 2 December 1998, a few days short of his 79th birthday./nTurner studied at the Henry Thornton School in Clapham before going to the London School of Economics, aged 16, to study with Harold Laski.

He graduated in June 1939 and spent the war years first in the army then on the Second Sea Lord's staff./nIn 1944, Turner joined the research and economic department of the TUC.  He served as part of the team that prepared the Interim Report on Post-War Reconstruction, which mapped out the Attlee government's programme. Turner worked under Sir Walter Citrine, which developed his lasting interest in economic policy, trade union activities and management and industrial relations. In 1947, Turner became Assistant Education Secretary for the TUC./nIn 1950, Turner was elected to the lectureship in industrial relations at University of Manchester. Senior Lecturer in 1959, he defended his PhD on industrial relations in the cotton industry in 1960,[3] which still is the seminal work on the subject./nTurner moved to Leeds University in 1961, when he was elected to the Montague Burton Chair of Industrial Relations, then to the Cambridge chair in 1964. He stayed there until his retirement from the Professorship, to be succeeded by William Brown, the son of one of his Leeds colleagues, in 1983. On his election to the Cambridge chair, Bert Turner became a Professorial Fellow of Churchill College, and a Life Fellow on becoming Professor Emeritus in 1984.[4]/nFrom his arrival in Cambridge, Bert Turner's career took two different but complementary directions. The nature of his research together with the world political conjuncture meant that he was very much in demand as an expert and consultant at the time of decolonisation. As a Visiting Professor, he taught at the universities of Lusaka (1969), Harvard and M.I.T. (1971\u201372), Sydney (1976\u201377), Hong Kong (1978\u201379, 1985\u201388), Bombay and Lucknow (1983) at South China University of Technology (1986), and Zhongshan (1987). He was also a founding member of the Department of Industrial Relations at Monash University in Melbourne./nTurner also served as an advisor and consultant for foreign governments and international organisations.  The first of such missions was a fairly sensitive one in the Congo where he met with both Moise Tshomb\u00e9 and Patrice Lumumba under the aegis of the UNO. Through the late sixties and seventies he thus worked in Zambia, Tanzania, Egypt, Ethiopia, Fiji, Papua New Guinea and other developing countries After working at the ILO in Geneva for some time, he was sent to Malawi (1967), and to Iran (1975). The last of these international missions was undertaken for the World Bank in China in 1988.  As Hong Kong's transfer to China was looming, he was granted a last Leverhume Senior Fellowship from 1985 to 1988, to assess the labour force situation in the colony. Through the years, on such complex and sometimes sensitive expeditions, he was accompanied by a team of younger assistants who have now become experts in their own right, such as Dudley Jackson, Keith Hart, Patricia Fosh, or Ng Sek Hong./nOn the home front, Turner is famous for his work on the motor industry, for which he gathered around him a notable team, including Geoffrey Roberts and Garfield Clack, who co-signed the relevant book with him.

He innovated in examining the impact of trade union organisation and policy on wages and wage differentials. He was among the first to consider the potential for prices and incomes policies to counter wage and price inflation.

When he left Berlin, Lie travelled to Paris, where he was joined by Klein two months later. There, they met Camille Jordan and Gaston Darboux. But on 19 July 1870 the Franco-Prussian War began and Klein (who was Prussian) had to leave France very quickly.

He claimed being harassed soon after Elshad Abdullayev submitted a complaint to the Attorney General's against Gular Ahmadova in July 2011. According to Zeynally, Ahmadova contacted him personally in October 2011 asking him \"not to publish any information against her that he may be given\".[13]/nDespite no other evidence having been brought against Zeynally,[14] he remained in custody. On 12 March 2013, he was sentenced to nine years in prison.[15] Zeynally appealed the verdict.[16]/nZeynally was pardoned and released on 30 December 2014, almost eight months after Ahmadova's sentence was suspended.[17]/nOn 25 September 2012, ex-rector of the Azerbaijan International University (which was stripped of its license and closed down in 2010) Elshad Abdullayev, who currently resides in France, posted a video on YouTube, dated 2005, in which a hidden camera captured a conversation involving himself, Gular Ahmadova and her friend Sevinj Babayeva in what appears to be an office room. During the sixteen-and-a-half-minute long footage, the three are seen and heard negotiating a price that Abdullayev is expected to pay in return to being given a seat in the National Assembly of Azerbaijan as an MP. In the video, Abdullayev offers to pay 500,000 USD, while Ahmadova insists on 1,000,000. In the video, Abdullayev repeatedly tries to get Ahmadova to admit that the money will go directly to the Head of the Presidential Administration of Azerbaijan Republic Ramiz Mehdiyev, though she never openly confirms that.[18]/nAhmadova initially denied being in the video and laid counter-accusations of bribery against Abdullayev.[19] Later Ahmadova and Babayeva made a statement that the money discussed in the video referred in fact to the student tuition fees misappropriated by Abdullayev after the closing down of the International University which they, as mediators, were urging him to redistribute to the former students.[20] Gular Ahmadova stepped down as an MP in order \"not to hinder the investigation\".[21][22]/nIn the next video released on 6 October 2012, Gular Ahmadova is heard talking about various high-ranking government officials compiling lists of MP candidates which they would like to see in the National Assembly following the election. Among them, she mentions Minister of Economic Development Farhad Aliyev, Minister of Health Ali Insanov (both arrested on the eve of the 2005 election for planning a coup d'\u00e9tat and sentenced to imprisonment), Minister of Emergency Situations Kamaladdin Heydarov, head of the Presidential Administration Ramiz Mehdiyev, President Ilham Aliyev, and First Lady Mehriban Aliyeva. Sevinj Babayeva confirms this in the video, which together with the first video appears to be a fragment of a single conversation.[23]/nOn 13 December 2012, Abdullayev released another video, in which he is seen speaking with Ahmadova's friend Sevinj Babayeva one-on-one. In the video, Babayeva claims that \"Ramiz is behind this all\" and \"has the final say\". She also reveals the details of Gular Ahmadova's win against Eldar Namazov in the 2005 parliamentary election through police involvement orchestrated by the said \"Ramiz\" to target Namazov's supporters at the polling station and changes made to the final election protocol for the constituency.[3]/nOn 14 December 2012, the primary regional assembly of the New Azerbaijan Party voted in favour of expelling Ahmadova from the party.[24]/nSevinj Babayeva, who fled to Istanbul, Turkey after the release of the first video, was reported to have died of heart failure after checking in a clinic on 26 December. Babayeva's son said he did not believe his mother had died of a heart problem and accused Ahmadova of having Babayeva poisoned after persuading her to escape to Istanbul and funding her trip and stay.[25][26] The Attorney General's Office later did confirm Babayeva's departure on Ahmadova's insistence,[27] but the autopsy did not reveal signs of poisoning.[28]/nGular Ahmadova was arrested on 13 February 2013 while attempting to leave for Georgia. According to her lawyers, Ahmadova was on her way to receive medical treatment there.[29] She was charged with embezzlement[30] and failure to report a grave offence. She pleaded not guilty.[31] Her official website was shut down, along with the newspaper Markaz which she had founded in 1998. On 5 July 2013, the Central Election Commission announced there would be no by-election held to fill the vacant seat following Ahmadova's resignation.[32]/nAccording to Ahmadova's lawyers, her physical and psychological state deteriorated while in custody. She refused to give any testimony till Elshad Abdullayev was tried,[33] and alleged the videos had been edited.[34] She was found guilty on all counts and on 2 December 2013 sentenced to three years in custody.[35] The relatively mild verdict was ruled considering the fact that Ahmadova had previously had a clear criminal record, had been three-time elected parliament member, had engaged in charitable work, was suffering from unnamed health conditions and was a parent of an underage child.[36] In January 2014, the Baku Court of Appeal upheld this decision.[37]/nOn 5 May 2014, the Court of Appeal held a hearing following which Ahmadova's sentence was suspended and she was released immediately, having thus served 14 months of her sentence in custody. She continued to claim her innocence.[38] The decision was heavily criticised by opposition members.[39] Legal expert Aslan Ismayilov questioned the validity of Gular Ahmadova's mild sentence for embezzling a large sum of money in comparison with the sentence of the opposition youth activist Ilkin Rustamzadeh charged with hooliganism and organising unauthorised protests, a much less grave offence, and sentenced to eight years in custody in 2014.[40] Elshad Abdullayev commented on Ahmadova's release by referring to the whole legal process as \"a court show that went to demonstrate once again the lawless nature of Azerbaijani courts.\"[41]/nIn an August 2015 interview, Ahmadova, without offering a specific date, admitted that she had been on the brink of committing suicide during \"the most difficult times\" of her life.[42] In late 2015, Ahmadova filed an appeal in order to have herself cleared out of all charges but on 16 February 2016, after she had failed twice to show up for a hearing, the court refused to rule in her favour.[43]/nIn February 2020, Ahmadova's son, 33, was arrested for criminal possession of a weapon.[44]", "14373679": "Cecil James Nesbitt, Ph.D., F.S.A., M.A.A.A.

He was a professor of international health at Karolinska Institute[4] and was the co-founder and chairman of the Gapminder Foundation, which developed the Trendalyzer software system. He held presentations around the world, including several TED Talks[5] in which he promoted the use of data (and data visualization) to explore development issues.[6] His posthumously published book Factfulness, coauthored with his daughter-in-law Anna Rosling R\u00f6nnlund and son Ola Rosling, became an international bestseller.[7]/nRosling was born in Uppsala, Sweden, on 28 July 1948.[8] From 1967 to 1974, he studied statistics and medicine at Uppsala University, and in 1972 he studied public health at St. John's Medical College, Bangalore, India. He became a licensed physician in 1976 and from 1979 to 1981 he served as District Medical Officer in Nacala in northern Mozambique. In 1981, he began investigating an outbreak of konzo, a paralytic disease first described in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.[9][10][11] His investigations earned him a Ph.D. at Uppsala University in 1986.[11] Rosling was dyslexic.[12][13]/nRosling presented the television documentary The Joy of Stats, which was broadcast in the United Kingdom by BBC Four in December 2010 and has been made available to 'catch up' on BBC iPlayer since.[14] He presented a documentary Don't Panic \u2014 The Truth about Population for the This World series using a Musion 3D projection display,[15] which appeared on BBC Two in the UK in November 2013.[16] In 2015 he presented the documentary Don't Panic: How to End Poverty in 15 Years, which was produced by Wingspan and aired on the BBC just ahead of the announcement of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.[17][18]/nRosling was a sword swallower, as demonstrated in the final moments of his second talk at the TED conference.[19] In 2009 he was listed as one of 100 leading global thinkers by Foreign Policy,[20] and in 2011 as one of 100 most creative people in business by Fast Company.[21] In 2011 he was elected member of the Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences and in 2012 as member of the Swedish Academy of Sciences.[22] He was included in the Time 100 list of the world's 100 most influential people in 2012.[23]/nRosling spent two decades studying outbreaks of konzo, a paralytic disease, in remote rural areas across Africa and supervised more than ten PhD students.[24] His work with Julie Cliff, Johannes M\u00e5rtensson, Per Lundqvist, and Bo S\u00f6rbo found that outbreaks occur among hunger-stricken rural populations in Africa where a diet dominated by insufficiently processed cassava results in simultaneous malnutrition and high dietary cyanide intake.[11][25][26]/nRosling's research also concerned other links between economic development, agriculture, poverty and health.[27] He worked as full-time consultant to the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) on primary health care from 1984 to 1990 and then as their consultant on HIV until 1994, traveling often to Sida program countries. He was at this time based at the Maternal and Child Care Department (International) at Uppsala University.  He was a health adviser to the World Health Organization, UNICEF and several aid agencies. In 1993 he was one of the initiators of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res in Sweden.[28] At Karolinska Institutet he was head of the Division of International Health (IHCAR) from 2001 to 2007. As chairman of the Karolinska International Research and Training Committee (1998\u20132004), he started health research collaborations with universities in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. He started new courses on global health and co-authored a textbook on global health that promotes a fact-based worldview.[29]/nRosling's son, Ola Rosling, built the Trendalyzer software to animate data compiled by the UN and the World Bank that helped him explain the world with graphics.[9] Rosling co-founded the Gapminder Foundation together with his son Ola and daughter-in-law Anna Rosling R\u00f6nnlund to develop Trendalyzer to convert international statistics into moving, interactive graphics. The provocative presentations that have resulted have made him famous,[9] and his lectures using Gapminder graphics to visualize world development have won awards.[30] The interactive animations are freely available from the Foundation's website./nIn March 2007, Google acquired the Trendalyzer software with the intention to scale it up and make it freely available for public statistics. In 2008, Google made available a Motion Chart\nGoogle Gadget and in 2009 the Public Data Explorer.[31]/nWhen he was 20, in 1968, doctors told  Rosling that there was something wrong with his liver and as a consequence, he stopped drinking alcohol. Aged 29, with a young family, he had testicular cancer which was successfully treated. In 1989, he was diagnosed with hepatitis C. Over the years this progressed and he developed liver cirrhosis. At the beginning of 2013, he was in the early stages of liver failure. However, at the same time, new hepatitis C drugs were released and he went to Japan to buy the drugs needed to treat the infection. He expressed concerns in the media over the restricted use of the new drugs due to high costs, stating that it is a crime not to give every person with hepatitis C access to the drugs.[32][33][34]/nRosling was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2016, and died of the disease on 7 February 2017.[6][35]/nRosling is commonly described as an optimist, though he personally rejected the label. In his posthumous book Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World \u2013 and Why Things Are Better Than You Think he wrote \"The five global risks that concern me most are the risks of a global pandemic, financial collapse, world war, climate change, and extreme poverty.\"[43] In summary, he wrote, \"People often call me an optimist, because I show them the enormous progress they didn't know about. That makes me angry. I'm not an optimist. That makes me sound naive. I'm a very serious \"possibilist\". That's something I made up. It means someone who neither hopes without reason, nor fears without reason, someone who constantly resists the overdramatic worldview. As a possibilist, I see all this progress, and it fills me with conviction and hope that further progress is possible. This is not optimistic. It is having a clear and reasonable idea about how things are. It is having a worldview that is constructive and useful.\"[43]/nIn his later years he advocated on behalf of refugees from Syria and partnered with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in this effort.[44] In his last book he wrote repeatedly about the tragedy of the war in Syria saying: \"The Syrian conflict will most likely prove to be the deadliest in the world since the Ethiopian-Eritrean war of 1998 to 2000.\"[43]/nHowever, some experts consider Rosling's world-view excessively rose-tinted, or anti-environmental. For instance, in The One-Sided Worldview of Hans Rosling[45] Christian Berggren, a Swedish professor of industrial management, argues that Factfulness, \"presents a highly biased sample of statistics as the true perspective on global development, avoids analysis of negative trends, and refrains from discussing difficult issues\". Seeing Rosling as more optimist than \"possibilist\", Berggren remarks that, \"Factfulness includes many graphs of 'bad things in decline' and 'good things on the rise' but not a single graph of 'bad things on the rise'.\" In 2013 in The Ecologist Robin Maynard reported Rosling as raging against the UN's population projections, and against some ecological objections to development: \"I don't give a damn about polar bears! I can live without polar bears.\"[46]/nHence, Rosling has been criticized as being Pollyannaist about the global political situation in the face of tragedies such as the long-running conflict in Syria, among others.[9] His work on population growth has also been criticized by Paul R. Ehrlich, the U.S. biologist and Professor of Population Studies at Stanford University, and Anne H. Ehrlich, associate director of the Center for Conservation Biology at Stanford University, in an article, published online by the MAHB, titled \"A Confused Statistician.\" The Ehrlichs also warn that, while some trends that Rosling cites may indeed be positive, there is the possibility of total collapse of those trends if social and political instabilities occur.[47]/nMax Roser saw this differently, writing in his obituary for Rosling: \"In portraits of Rosling, he was too often presented as an \"optimist\" that tells the world that things will turn out well. This is wrong. What Rosling did was to present the empirical evidence up to the present, and he showed that many vastly underestimate the progress that the world has made in improving living conditions globally. The majority of the world is better off now than at any point in history before. This was his positive message. But he never suggested that this should give anyone any reason to be complacent. He always used his fame to draw attention to the living conditions of the worst off and to denounce the lack of support they were receiving from the large group of people in the world that is living in unprecedented comfort. Hans Rosling's message was never that all is good; the enthusiasm for his work came from the fact that he was always convinced that a better world is possible if we care to work towards it.\"[48]", "60511034": "Moshe Goldberg (Hebrew: \u05de\u05e9\u05d4 \u05d2\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d2\u200e) (born 1945) is an Israeli mathematician.

He is remembered as an astrologer, mathematician, cosmologist, Qabalist and Rosicrucian./nFludd is best known for his compilations in occult philosophy. He had a celebrated exchange of views with Johannes Kepler concerning the scientific and hermetic approaches to knowledge.[1]/nHe was born at Milgate House, Bearsted, Kent, not too long before[clarification needed] 17 January 1573/4.[2] He was the son of Sir Thomas Fludd, a high-ranking governmental official (Queen Elizabeth I's treasurer for war in Europe), and Member of Parliament.[3] His mother was Elizabeth Andrews Fludd.[4]  A collage of 12 Coats of Arms of Fludd ancestors are shown in the painting above his right shoulder. His paternal arms goes back to Rhirid Flaidd whose name originates from Welsh meaning bloody or red wolf.[5]/nHe entered St John's College, Oxford as a commoner in 1591, graduating with a B.A. in 1597 and an M.A. in 1598.[2] St John's College, Oxford was one of the few in England with any provision for Fellowship (medicine); William Huffman suggests that the presence of a Medical Fellow at St John's College, Oxford influenced Fludd's interest in studying medicine.[2] During Fludd's time at St John's College, the Medical Fellow in residence was Matthew Gwinne; Gwinne had previously produced a tract indicating that, while he practiced Galenic medicine, he was also familiar with the main Paracelsian medical work. Fludd may have encountered Gwinne, or his writing, during his time at Oxford, providing an additional influence for his later medical philosophy and practice./nBetween 1598 and 1604, Fludd studied medicine, chemistry and hermeticism on the European mainland following his graduation. His itinerary is not known in detail.[6] On his own account he spent a winter in the Pyrenees studying theurgy (the practice of rituals) with the Jesuits.[7] Furthermore, he indicated that he travelled throughout Spain, Italy and Germany following his time in France./nUpon returning to England in 1604, Fludd matriculated to Christ Church, Oxford. He intended to take a degree in medicine. The main requirements to obtain this, at the time, included demonstrating that he (the supplicant) had read and understood the required medical texts\u2014primarily those by Galen and Hippocrates. Fludd defended three theses following these texts, and on 14 May 1605, Fludd made his supplication. He graduated with his M.B. and M.D. on 16 May 1605./nAfter graduating from Christ Church, Fludd moved to London, settling in Fenchurch Street, and making repeated attempts to enter the College of Physicians. Fludd encountered problems with the College examiners, both because of his unconcealed contempt for traditional medical authorities (he had adopted the views of Paracelsus), and because of his attitude to authority\u2014especially those of the ancients like Galen. After at least six failures, he was admitted in September 1609. He became a prosperous London doctor, serving as Censor of the College four times (1618, 1627, 1633, and 1634).[2] He also participated in an inspection of the London apothecaries put on by the College in 1614, and helped to author the Pharmacopoeia Londinensis in 1618\u2014a directory of standardized pharmaceutical preparations given by the London College of Physicians. He became such an established figure within the College that he was included in seventeenth-century critiques of the college, including those by Nicholas Culpepper and Peter Coles./nSubsequently, both his career and his standing in the College took a turn very much for the better. He was on good terms with Sir William Paddy.[6] Fludd was one of the first to support in print the theory of the circulation of the blood of the college's William Harvey.[8] To what extent Fludd may have actually influenced Harvey is still debated, in the context that Harvey's discovery is hard to date precisely.[9] The term \"circulation\" was certainly ambiguous at that time.[10]/nWhile he followed Paracelsus in his medical views rather than the ancient authorities, he was also a believer that real wisdom was to be found in the writings of natural magicians.  His view of these mystical authorities was inclined towards the great mathematicians, and he believed, like Pythagoras and his followers, that numbers contained access to great hidden secrets.  Certainty in religion could be discovered only through serious study of numbers and ratios.  This view later brought Fludd into conflict with Johannes Kepler./nMuch of Fludd's writing, and his pathology of disease, centered around the sympathies found in nature between man, the terrestrial Earth, and the divine. While Paracelsian in nature, Fludd's own theory on the origin of all things posited that, instead of the Tria Prima, all species and things stemmed from first, dark Chaos, then divine Light which acted upon the Chaos, which finally brought forth the waters. This last element was also called the Spirit of the Lord, and it made up the passive matter of all other substances, including all secondary elements and the four qualities of the ancients. Moreover, the Fluddean tripartite theory concluded that Paracelsus' own conception of the three primary principles\u2014Sulphur, Salt and Mercury\u2014eventually derived from Chaos and Light interacting to create variations of the waters, or Spirit./nThe Trinitarian division is important in that it reflects a mystical framework for biology. Fludd was heavily reliant on scripture; in the Bible, the number three represented the principium formarum, or the original form. Furthermore, it was the number of the Holy Trinity. Thus, the number three formed the perfect body, paralleling the Trinity. This allowed man and Earth to approach the infinity of God, and created a universality in sympathy and composition between all things./nFludd's application of his mystically inclined tripartite theory to his philosophies of medicine and science was best illustrated through his conception of the Macrocosm and microcosm relationship. The divine light (the second of Fludd's primary principles) was the \"active agent\" responsible for creation. This informed the development of the world and the Sun, respectively. Fludd concluded, from a reading of Psalm 19:4\u2014\"In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun\"\u2014that the Spirit of the Lord was contained literally within the Sun, placing it central to Fludd's model of the macrocosm.[11] remained in manuscript.[12] As the Sun was to the Earth, so was the heart to mankind. The Sun conveyed Spirit to the Earth through its rays, which circulated in and about the Earth giving it life. Likewise, the blood of man carried the Spirit of the Lord (the same Spirit provided by the Sun), and circulated through the body of man. This was an application of the sympathies and parallels provided to all of God's Creation by Fludd's tripartite theory of matter./nThe blood was central to Fludd's conception of the relationship between the microcosm and macrocosm; the blood and the Spirit it circulated interacted directly with the Spirit conveyed to the macrocosm. The macrocosmal Spirit, carried by the Sun, was influenced by astral bodies and changed in composition through such influence. Comparatively, the astral influences on the macrocosmal Spirit could be transported to the microcosmal Spirit in the blood by the active commerce assumed between the macrocosm and the microcosm. Fludd extended this interaction to his conception of disease: the movement of Spirit between the macrocosm and microcosm could be corrupted and invade the microcosm as disease. Like Paracelsus, Fludd conceived of disease as an external invader, rather than a complexional imbalance./nFludd died on 8 September 1637 in London. He was buried in Holy Cross Church, Bearsted./nFludd's works are mainly controversial. In succession he defended the Rosicrucians against Andreas Libavius, debated with Kepler, argued against French natural philosophers including Gassendi, and engaged in the discussion of the weapon-salve.[13]/nFludd was not a member of the Rosicrucians, as often alleged, but he defended their thoughts as expressed in numerous manifestos and pamphlets.[14] He produced a quick work, the Apologia Compendiaria, against the claims of Libavius that the Rosicrucians indulged in heresy, diabolical magic and sedition, made in his Analysis confessionis Fraternitatis de Rosea Cruce (Analysis of the Confession of the Rosy Cross) of 1615. Fludd returned to the subject at greater length, the following year.[2]/nIt is now seriously doubted that any formal organisation identifiable as the \"Brothers of the Rose Cross\" (Rosicrucians) ever actually existed in any extant form. The theological and philosophical claims circulating under this name appear, to these outsiders, to have been more an intellectual fashion that swept Europe at the time of the Counter Reformation. These thinkers suppose that in claiming to be part of a secret cult, scholars of alchemy, the occult, and Hermetic mysticism, merely sought that additional prestige by being able to promote their views while claiming exclusive adherence to some revolutionary pan-European secret society. By this logic, some suppose the society itself to never have existed.[citation needed]/nBetween 1607 and 1616, two anonymous Rosicrucian manifestos were published by some anonymous person or group, first in Germany and later throughout Europe. These were the Fama Fraternitatis, (The Fame of the Brotherhood of RC), and the Confessio Fraternitatis, (The Confession of the Brotherhood of RC). The first manifesto was influenced by the work of the respected hermetic philosopher Heinrich Khunrath, of Hamburg, author of the Amphitheatrum Sapientiae Aeternae (1609) who himself had borrowed generously from the work of John Dee. It referred favourably to the role played by the Illuminati and it featured a convoluted manufactured history dating back to archaic mysteries of the Middle East, with references to the Kabala and the Persian Magi./nThe second manifesto had decidedly anti-Catholic views which were popular at the time of the Counter Reformation. These manifestos were re-issued several times, and were both supported and countered by numerous pamphlets from anonymous authors: about 400 manuscripts and books were published on the subject between 1614 and 1620. The peak of the \"Rosicrucianism furore\" came in 1622 with mysterious posters appearing on the walls of Paris, and occult philosophers such as Michael Maier, Robert Fludd and Thomas Vaughan interested themselves in the Rosicrucian world view. Others intellectuals and authors later claimed to have published Rosicrucian documents in order to ridicule their views. The furore faded out and the Rosicrucians disappeared from public life until 1710 when the secret cult appears to have been revived as a formal organisation./nIt is claimed that the work of John Amos Comenius and Samuel Hartlib on early education in England were strongly influenced by Rosicrucian ideas, but this has not been proven, and it appears unlikely except in the similarity in their anti-Catholic views and emphasis on science education.  Rosicrucianism is also said to have been influential at the time when operative Masonry (a guild of artisans) was being transformed to speculative masonry\u2014Freemasonry\u2014which was a social fraternity, that also originally promoted the scientific and educative view of Comenius, Hartlib, Isaac Newton and Francis Bacon./nRosicrucian literature became the sandbox of theosophists, and charlatans, who claimed to be connected with the mysterious Brotherhood. Robert Fludd led the battle. It is said by some that he was \"the great English mystical philosopher of the seventeenth century, a man of immense erudition, of exalted mind, and, to judge by his writings, of extreme personal sanctity\".[15]/nIt has also been said that what Fludd did was to liberate occultism, both from traditional Aristotelian philosophy, and from the coming (Cartesian) philosophy of his time.[16]/nJohannes Kepler criticised Fludd's theory of cosmic harmony in an appendix to his Harmonice Mundi (1619).[17]/nAccording to Brian Copenhaver, \"Kepler accused Fludd of being a theosophist, and Kepler was right\". Fludd was well-read in the tradition coming through Francesco Giorgi.[19] Marin Mersenne attacked him in Qu\u00e6stiones Celebres in Genesim (1623)./nPierre Gassendi took up the controversy in an Examen Philosophi\u00e6 Fluddan\u00e6 (1630). This was at Mersenne's request. Gassendi attacked Fludd's neo-Platonic position. He rejected the syncretic move that placed alchemy, cabbala and Christian religion on the same footing; and Fludd's anima mundi. Further he dismissed Fludd's biblical exegesis.[13][20]/nFludd also wrote against The Tillage of Light (1623) of Patrick Scot; Scot like Mersenne found the large claims of hermetic alchemy to be objectionable.[21] Fludd defended alchemy against the criticisms of Scot, who took it to be merely allegorical. This work, Truth's Golden Harrow,[11] remained in manuscript.[12]/nThe idea that certain parallel actions could be initiated and linked by 'sympathetic' mysterious forces was widespread at this time, probably arising mainly from the actions of the magnet, shown by William Gilbert to always point towards some point in the northern sky.  The idea owed a lot of the older Aristotelian and neo-Platonic views about soul-like forces./nFludd's philosophy is presented in Utriusque Cosmi, Maioris scilicet et Minoris, metaphysica, physica, atque technica Historia (The metaphysical, physical, and technical history of the two worlds, namely the greater and the lesser, published in Germany between 1617 and 1621);[22] according to Frances Yates, his memory system (which she describes in detail in The Art of Memory, pp.\u00a0321\u2013341) may reflect the layout of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre (The Art of Memory, Chapter XVI)./nIn 1618, Fludd wrote De Musica Mundana (Mundane Music) which described his theories of music, including his mundane (also known as \"divine\" or \"celestial\") monochord.[23]/nIn 1630, Fludd proposed many perpetual motion machines. People were trying to patent variations of Fludd's machine in the 1870s. Fludd's machine worked by recirculation by means of a water wheel and Archimedean screw. The device pumps the water back into its own supply tank.[24][25]/nHis main works are:[13]/nPosthumous were:[13]/nAn unpublished manuscript, copied by an amanuensis, and headed Declaratio breuis, &c., is in the Royal manuscripts, British Library, 12 C. ii. Fludd's Opera consist of his folios, not reprinted, but collected and arranged in six volumes in 1638; appended is a Clavis Philosophi\u00e6 et Alchimi\u00e6 Fluddan\u00e6, Frankfort, 1633.[13]/nWilliam T. Walker, reviewing two books on Fludd in The Sixteenth Century Journal (by Joscelyn Godwin, and William Huffman), writes that \"Fludd relied on the Bible, the Cabbala, and the traditions of alchemy and astrology. Many of his contemporaries labelled Fludd a magician and condemned him for his sympathy for the occult.\"[27] He cites Godwin's book as arguing that Fludd was part of the tradition of Christian esotericism that includes Origen and Meister Eckhart. He finds convincing the argument in Huffman's book that Fludd was not a Rosicrucian but was \"a leading advocate of Renaissance Christian Neo-Platonism. Fludd's advocacy of an intellectual philosophy in decline has done much to assure his general neglect.\"[27]", "906145": "Derek Roy Taunt (16 November 1917(Note 1) \u2013 15 July 2004) was a British mathematician who worked as a codebreaker during World War II at Bletchley Park./nTaunt attended Enfield Grammar, then the City of London School.[1] He studied mathematics at Jesus College, Cambridge between 1936 and 1939.[2] He was accepted as a research student by G.

Building on the work of Hermann Grassmann, he introduced what is now termed geometric algebra, a special case of the Clifford algebra named in his honour. The operations of geometric algebra have the effect of mirroring, rotating, translating, and mapping the geometric objects that are being modelled to new positions. Clifford algebras in general and geometric algebra in particular have been of ever increasing importance to mathematical physics,[1] geometry,[2] and computing.[3] Clifford was the first to suggest that gravitation might be a manifestation of an underlying geometry. In his philosophical writings he coined the expression mind-stuff./nBorn at Exeter, William Clifford showed great promise at school. He went on to King's College London (at age 15) and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was elected fellow in 1868, after being second wrangler in 1867 and second Smith's prizeman.[4][5] Being second was a fate he shared with others who became famous scientists, including William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) and James Clerk Maxwell.

He taught and administered by day, and wrote by night. A half-year holiday in Algeria and Spain allowed him to resume his duties for 18 months, after which he collapsed again. He went to the island of Madeira to recover, but died there of tuberculosis after a few months, leaving a widow with two children./nClifford and his wife are buried in London's Highgate Cemetery, near the graves of George Eliot and Herbert Spencer, just north of the grave of Karl Marx./nThe academic journal Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras publishes on Clifford's legacy in kinematics and abstract algebra./n\"Clifford was above all and before all a geometer.\"/nThe discovery of non-Euclidean geometry opened new possibilities in geometry in Clifford's era. The field of intrinsic differential geometry was born, with the concept of curvature broadly applied to space itself as well as to curved lines and surfaces. Clifford was very much impressed by Bernhard Riemann\u2019s 1854 essay \"On the hypotheses which lie at the bases of geometry\".[9] In 1870, he reported to the Cambridge Philosophical Society on the curved space concepts of Riemann, and included speculation on the bending of space by gravity. Clifford's translation[10][11] of Riemann's paper was published in Nature in 1873. His report at Cambridge, \"On the Space-Theory of Matter\", was published in 1876, anticipating Albert Einstein's general relativity by 40 years. Clifford elaborated elliptic space geometry as a non-Euclidean metric space. Equidistant curves in elliptic space are now said to be Clifford parallels./nClifford's contemporaries considered him acute and original, witty and warm. He often worked late into the night, which may have hastened his death. He published papers on a range of topics including algebraic forms and projective geometry and the textbook Elements of Dynamic. His application of graph theory to invariant theory was followed up by William Spottiswoode and Alfred Kempe.[12]/nIn 1878, Clifford published a seminal work, building on Grassmann's extensive algebra.[13] He had succeeded in unifying the quaternions, developed by William Rowan Hamilton, with Grassmann's outer product (aka the exterior product). He understood the geometric nature of Grassmann's creation, and that the quaternions fit cleanly into the algebra Grassmann had developed. The versors in quaternions facilitate representation of rotation. Clifford laid the foundation for a geometric product, composed of the sum of the inner product and Grassmann's outer product. The geometric product was eventually formalized by the Hungarian mathematician Marcel Riesz. The inner product equips geometric algebra with a metric, fully incorporating distance and angle relationships for lines, planes, and volumes, while the outer product gives those planes and volumes vector-like properties, including a directional bias./nCombining the two brought the operation of division into play. This greatly expanded our qualitative understanding of how objects interact in space. Crucially, it also provided the means for quantitatively calculating the spatial consequences of those interactions. The resulting geometric algebra, as he called it, eventually realized the long sought goal[i] of creating an algebra that mirrors the movements and projections of objects in 3-dimensional space.[14]/nMoreover, Clifford's algebraic schema extends to higher dimensions. The algebraic operations have the same symbolic form as they do in 2 or 3-dimensions. The importance of general Clifford algebras has grown over time, while their isomorphism classes - as real algebras - have been identified in other mathematical systems beyond simply the quaternions.[15]/nThe realms of real analysis and complex analysis have been expanded through the algebra H of quaternions, thanks to its notion of a three-dimensional sphere embedded in a four-dimensional space. Quaternion versors, which inhabit this 3-sphere, provide a representation of the rotation group SO(3). Clifford noted that Hamilton's biquaternions were a tensor product \n\n\n\nH\n\u2297\nC\n\n\n{\\displaystyle H\\otimes C}\n\n of known algebras, and proposed instead two other tensor products of H: Clifford argued that the \"scalars\" taken from the complex numbers C might instead be taken from split-complex numbers D or from the dual numbers N. In terms of tensor products, \n\n\n\nH\n\u2297\nD\n\n\n{\\displaystyle H\\otimes D}\n\n produces split-biquaternions, while \n\n\n\nH\n\u2297\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle H\\otimes N}\n\n forms dual quaternions. The algebra of dual quaternions is used to express screw displacement, a common mapping in kinematics./nAs a philosopher, Clifford's name is chiefly associated with two phrases of his coining, mind-stuff and the tribal self. The former symbolizes his metaphysical conception, suggested to him by his reading of Baruch Spinoza,[4] which Clifford (1878) defined as follows:[17]/nThat element of which, as we have seen, even the simplest feeling is a complex, I shall call Mind-stuff. A moving molecule of inorganic matter does not possess mind or consciousness\u00a0; but it possesses a small piece of mind-stuff. When molecules are so combined together as to form the film on the under side of a jelly-fish, the elements of mind-stuff which go along with them are so combined as to form the faint beginnings of Sentience. When the molecules are so combined as to form the brain and nervous system of a vertebrate, the corresponding elements of mind-stuff are so combined as to form some kind of consciousness; that is to say, changes in the complex which take place at the same time get so linked together that the repetition of one implies the repetition of the other. When matter takes the complex form of a living human brain, the corresponding mind-stuff takes the form of a human consciousness, having intelligence and volition./nRegarding Clifford's concept, Sir Frederick Pollock wrote:/nBriefly put, the conception is that mind is the one ultimate reality; not mind as we know it in the complex forms of conscious feeling and thought, but the simpler elements out of which thought and feeling are built up. The hypothetical ultimate element of mind, or atom of mind-stuff, precisely corresponds to the hypothetical atom of matter, being the ultimate fact of which the material atom is the phenomenon. Matter and the sensible universe are the relations between particular organisms, that is, mind organized into consciousness, and the rest of the world. This leads to results which would in a loose and popular sense be called materialist. But the theory must, as a metaphysical theory, be reckoned on the idealist side. To speak technically, it is an idealist monism.[4]/nTribal self, on the other hand, gives the key to Clifford's ethical view, which explains conscience and the moral law by the development in each individual of a 'self,' which prescribes the conduct conducive to the welfare of the 'tribe.' Much of Clifford's contemporary prominence was due to his attitude toward religion. Animated by an intense love of his conception of truth and devotion to public duty, he waged war on such ecclesiastical systems as seemed to him to favour obscurantism, and to put the claims of sect above those of human society. The alarm was greater, as theology was still unreconciled with Darwinism; and Clifford was regarded as a dangerous champion of the anti-spiritual tendencies then imputed to modern science.[4] There has also been debate on the extent to which Clifford's doctrine of 'concomitance' or 'psychophysical parallelism' influenced John Hughlings Jackson's model of the nervous system and, through him, the work of Janet, Freud, Ribot, and Ey.[18]/nIn his 1877 essay, The Ethics of Belief, Clifford argues that it is immoral to believe things for which one lacks evidence.[19] He describes a ship-owner who planned to send to sea an old and not well-built ship full of passengers. The ship-owner had doubts suggested to him that the ship might not be seaworthy: \"These doubts preyed upon his mind, and made him unhappy.\" He considered having the ship refitted even though it would be expensive. At last, \"he succeeded in overcoming these melancholy reflections.\" He watched the ship depart, \"with a light heart\u2026and he got his insurance money when she went down in mid-ocean and told no tales.\"[19]/nClifford argues that the ship-owner was guilty of the deaths of the passengers even though he sincerely believed the ship was sound: \"[H]e had no right to believe on such evidence as was before him.\"[ii] Moreover, he contends that even in the case where the ship successfully reaches the destination, the decision remains immoral, because the morality of the choice is defined forever once the choice is made, and actual outcome, defined by blind chance, doesn't matter. The ship-owner would be no less guilty: his wrongdoing would never be discovered, but he still had no right to make that decision given the information available to him at the time./nClifford famously concludes with what has come to be known as Clifford's principle: \"it is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.\"[19]/nAs such, he is arguing in direct opposition to religious thinkers for whom 'blind faith' (i.e. belief in things in spite of the lack of evidence for them) was a virtue. This paper was famously attacked by pragmatist philosopher William James in his \"Will to Believe\" lecture. Often these two works are read and published together as touchstones for the debate over evidentialism, faith, and overbelief./nThough Clifford never constructed a full theory of spacetime and relativity, there are some remarkable observations he made in print that foreshadowed these modern concepts:\nIn his book Elements of Dynamic (1878), he introduced \"quasi-harmonic motion in a hyperbola\". He wrote an expression for a parametrized unit hyperbola, which other authors later used as a model for relativistic velocity. Elsewhere he states:[20]/nThis passage makes reference to biquaternions, though Clifford made these into split-biquaternions as his independent development.\nThe book continues with a chapter \"On the bending of space\", the substance of general relativity. Clifford also discussed his views in On the Space-Theory of Matter in 1876./nIn 1910, William Barrett Frankland quoted the Space-Theory of Matter in his book on parallelism: \"The boldness of this speculation is surely unexcelled in the history of thought. Up to the present, however, it presents the appearance of an Icarian flight.\"[21] Years later, after general relativity had been advanced by Albert Einstein, various authors noted that Clifford had anticipated Einstein. Hermann Weyl (1923), for instance, mentioned Clifford as one of those who, like Bernhard Riemann, anticipated the geometric ideas of relativity.[22]/nIn 1940, Eric Temple Bell published The Development of Mathematics, in which he discusses the prescience of Clifford on relativity:[23]/nJohn Archibald Wheeler, during the 1960 International Congress for Logic, Methodology, and Philosophy of Science (CLMPS) at Stanford, introduced his geometrodynamics formulation of general relativity by crediting Clifford as the initiator.[24]/nIn The Natural Philosophy of Time (1961), Gerald James Whitrow recalls Clifford's prescience, quoting him in order to describe the Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric in cosmology.[25]/nCornelius Lanczos (1970) summarizes Clifford's premonitions:[26]/nLikewise, Banesh Hoffmann (1973) writes:[27]/nIn 1990, Ruth Farwell and Christopher Knee examined the record on acknowledgement of Clifford's foresight.[28] They conclude that \"it was Clifford, not Riemann, who anticipated some of the conceptual ideas of General Relativity.\" To explain the lack of recognition of Clifford's prescience, they point out that he was an expert in metric geometry, and \"metric geometry was too challenging to orthodox epistemology to be pursued.\"[28] In 1992, Farwell and Knee continued their study of Clifford and Riemann:[29]/n[They] hold that once tensors had been used in the theory of general relativity, the framework existed in which a geometrical perspective in physics could be developed and allowed the challenging geometrical conceptions of Riemann and Clifford to be rediscovered./n\"I\u2026hold that in the physical world nothing else takes place but this variation [of the curvature of space].\"/n\"There is no scientific discoverer, no poet, no painter, no musician, who will not tell you that he found ready made his discovery or poem or picture\u2014that it came to him from outside, and that he did not consciously create it from within.\"/n\"It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.\"/n\"If a man, holding a belief which he was taught in childhood or persuaded of afterwards, keeps down and pushes away any doubts which arise about it in his mind, purposely avoids the reading of books and the company of men that call in question or discuss it, and regards as impious those questions which cannot easily be asked without disturbing it\u2014the life of that man is one long sin against mankind.\"/n\"I was not, and was conceived.

His parents were divorced during his infancy. When war broke out his father was captured in Soviet-controlled Poland and murdered in the 1940 Katy\u0144 Massacre. He belonged to the Polish nobility; \u015awierczkowski's mother belonged to the upper middle class and would have probably suffered deportation and murder by the Nazis. However she had German connections and was able to gain relatively privileged class 2 Volksliste citizenship. At the end of the war \u015awierczkowski's mother was forced into hiding near Toru\u0144 until she was confident that she could win exoneration from the Soviet-controlled government for her Volksliste status and be rehabilitated as a Polish citizen. Meanwhile, \u015awierczkowski lived in a rented room in Toru\u0144  and attended school there./n\u015awierczkowski won a university place to study astronomy at the University of Wroc\u0142aw but switched to mathematics to avoid the drudgery of astronomical calculations. He discovered a natural ability through his friendship with Jan Mycielski and was able to remain at Wroc\u0142aw to complete his masters under Jan Mikusi\u0144ski. He graduated with a PhD in 1960, his dissertation including the now-famous three-gap theorem, which he proved in 1956 in answer to a question of Hugo Steinhaus./nThe three-gap theorem[2] says: take arbitrarily finitely many integer multiples of an irrational number between zero and one and plot them as points around a circle of unit circumference; then at most three different distances will occur between consecutive points. This answered a question of Hugo Steinhaus. The theorem belongs to the field of Diophantine approximation since the smallest of the three distances observed may be used to give a rational approximation to the chosen irrational number. It has been extended and generalised in many ways.[3]/nThe non-tetratorus theorem, published by \u015awierczkowski in 1958,[4]\nstates that it is impossible to construct a closed chain (torus) of regular tetrahedra, placed face to face. Again this answered a question of Hugo Steinhaus. The result is attractive and counter-intuitive, since the tetrahedron is unique among the Platonic solids in having this property. Recent work\n[5] by Michael Elgersma and Stan Wagon has sparked new interest in this result by showing that one can create chains of tetrahedra that are arbitrarily close to being closed./nIn 1964, in a joint work with Jan Mycielski, he established one of the early results on the axiom of determinacy (AD), namely that AD implies that all sets of real numbers are Lebesgue measurable.[6]/n\u015awierczkowski's last mathematical work[7] was on proving G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems using hereditarily finite sets instead of encoding of finite sequences of natural numbers. It is these proofs that were the basis for the production, in 2015, of mechanised proofs of G\u00f6del's two famous theorems.[8]/n\u015awierczkowski had a very migratory career. He was allowed abroad from Poland to study at Dundee University, where his work with Alexander Murray MacBeath would later attract the attention of Andr\u00e9 Weil. He then took up a research fellowship at Glasgow University before being obliged to return to Poland. When the Polish Academy of Sciences granted him a passport to attend a conference in Stuttgart he used this as an opportunity to leave Poland for good in 1961, first resuming his fellowship in Glasgow before taking a job in the recently created University of Sussex. In 1963 he visited Andr\u00e9 Weil at the Institute for Advanced Study and thereafter, between 1964 and 1973, held posts at the University of Washington, the Australian National University and Queen's University in Canada.

His father, Ranieri, was from a leading wealthy family in Urbino. Ranieri was noted for his role as a soldier and also as the author of two books on military architecture. The Duke of Urbino, Duke Guidobaldo II, honoured him with the title Marchese del Monte so the family had only become a noble one in the generation before Guidobaldo.

This question was one of the outstanding open problems of his day, and had been unresolved for over 250 years.[2] He was also an innovator in the field of elliptic functions, discoverer of Abelian functions. He made his discoveries while living in poverty and died at the age of 26 from tuberculosis./nMost of his work was done in six or seven years of his working life.[3] Regarding Abel, the French mathematician Charles Hermite said: \"Abel has left mathematicians enough to keep them busy for five hundred years.\"[3][4] Another French mathematician, Adrien-Marie Legendre, said: \"What a head the young Norwegian has!\"[5]/nThe Abel Prize in mathematics, originally proposed in 1899 to complement the Nobel Prizes (but first awarded in 2003), is named in his honour./nNiels Henrik Abel was born prematurely in \nNedstrand, Norway, as the second child of the pastor S\u00f8ren Georg Abel and Anne Marie Simonsen. When Niels Henrik Abel was born, the family was living at a rectory on Finn\u00f8y. Much suggests that Niels Henrik was born in the neighboring parish, as his parents were guests of the bailiff in Nedstrand in July / August of his year of birth.[6][note 1]/nNiels Henrik Abel's father, S\u00f8ren Georg Abel, had a degree in theology and philosophy and served as pastor at Finn\u00f8y. S\u00f8ren's father, Niels's grandfather, Hans Mathias Abel, was also a pastor, at Gjerstad Church near the town of Ris\u00f8r. S\u00f8ren had spent his childhood at Gjerstad, and had also served as chaplain there; and after his father's death in 1804, S\u00f8ren was appointed pastor at Gjerstad and the family moved there. The Abel family originated in Schleswig and came to Norway in the 17th century./nAnne Marie Simonsen was from Ris\u00f8r; her father, Niels Henrik Saxild Simonsen, was a tradesman and merchant ship-owner, and said to be the richest person in Ris\u00f8r. Anne Marie had grown up with two stepmothers, in relatively luxurious surroundings. At Gjerstad rectory, she enjoyed arranging balls and social gatherings. Much suggests she was early on an alcoholic and took little interest in the upbringing of the children. Niels Henrik and his brothers were given their schooling by their father, with handwritten books to read. An addition table in a book of mathematics reads: 1+0=0.[6]/nWith Norwegian independence and the first election held in Norway, in 1814, S\u00f8ren Abel was elected as a representative to the Storting. Meetings of the Storting were held until 1866 in the main hall of the Cathedral School in Christiania (now known as Oslo). Almost certainly, this is how he came into contact with the school, and he decided that his eldest son, Hans Mathias, should start there the following year. However, when the time for his departure approached, Hans was so saddened and depressed over having to leave home that his father did not dare send him away. He decided to send Niels instead.[6]/nIn 1815, Niels Abel entered the Cathedral School at the age of 13. His elder brother Hans joined him there a year later. They shared rooms and had classes together. Hans got better grades than Niels; however, a new mathematics teacher, Bernt Michael Holmboe, was appointed in 1818. He gave the students mathematical tasks to do at home. He saw Niels Henrik's talent in mathematics, and encouraged him to study the subject to an advanced level. He even gave Niels private lessons after school./nIn 1818, S\u00f8ren Abel had a public theological argument with the theologian Stener Johannes Stenersen regarding his catechism from 1806. The argument was well covered in the press. S\u00f8ren was given the nickname \"Abel Treating\" (Norwegian: \"Abel Spandabel\"). Niels' reaction to the quarrel was said to have been \"excessive gaiety\". At the same time, S\u00f8ren also almost faced impeachment after insulting Carsten Anker, the host of the Norwegian Constituent Assembly; and in September 1818 he returned to Gjerstad with his political career in ruins. He began drinking heavily and died only two years later, in 1820, aged 48./nBernt Michael Holmboe supported Niels Henrik Abel with a scholarship to remain at the school and raised money from his friends to enable him to study at the Royal Frederick University./nWhen Abel entered the university in 1821, he was already the most knowledgeable mathematician in Norway. Holmboe had nothing more he could teach him and Abel had studied all the latest mathematical literature in the university library. During that time, Abel started working on the quintic equation in radicals. Mathematicians had been looking for a solution to this problem for over 250 years. In 1821, Abel thought he had found the solution. The two professors of mathematics in Christiania, S\u00f8ren Rasmussen and Christopher Hansteen, found no errors in Abel's formulas, and sent the work on to the leading mathematician in the Nordic countries, Carl Ferdinand Degen in Copenhagen. He too found no faults but still doubted that the solution, which so many outstanding mathematicians had sought for so long, could really have been found by an unknown student in far-off Christiania. Degen noted, however, Abel's unusually sharp mind, and believed that such a talented young man should not waste his abilities on such a \"sterile object\" as the fifth degree equation, but rather on elliptic functions and transcendence; for then, wrote Degen, he would \"discover Magellanian thoroughfares to large portions of a vast analytical ocean\".[6] Degen asked Abel to give a numerical example of his method. While trying to provide an example, Abel found a mistake in his paper.[9] This led to a discovery in 1823 that a solution to a fifth- or higher-degree equation was impossible.[10]/nAbel graduated in 1822. His performance was exceptionally high in mathematics and average in other matters./nAfter he graduated, professors from university supported Abel financially, and Professor Christopher Hansteen let him live in a room in the attic of his home. Abel would later view Ms. Hansteen as his second mother. While living here, Abel helped his younger brother, Peder Abel, through examen artium. He also helped his sister Elisabeth to find work in the town./nIn early 1823, Niels Abel published his first article in \"Magazin for Naturvidenskaberne\", Norway's first scientific journal, which had been co-founded by Professor Hansteen. Abel published several articles, but the journal soon realized that this was not material for the common reader. In 1823, Abel also wrote a paper in French. It was \"a general representation of the possibility to integrate all differential formulas\" (Norwegian: en alminnelig Fremstilling af Muligheten at integrere alle mulige Differential-Formler). He applied for funds at the university to publish it. However, the work was lost while being reviewed, never to be found thereafter.[6]/nIn mid-1823, Professor Rasmussen gave Abel a gift of 100 speciedaler so he could travel to Copenhagen and visit Ferdinand Degen and other mathematicians there. While in Copenhagen, Abel did some work on Fermat's Last Theorem. Abel's uncle, Peder Mandrup Tuxen, lived at the naval base in Christianshavn, Copenhagen, and at a ball there Niels Abel met Christine Kemp, his future fianc\u00e9e. In 1824, Christine moved to Son, Norway to work as a governess and the couple got engaged over Christmas.[6]/nAfter returning from Copenhagen, Abel applied for a government scholarship in order to visit top mathematicians in Germany and France, but he was instead granted 200 speciedaler yearly for two years, to stay in Christiania and study German and French. In the next two years, he was promised a scholarship of 600 speciedaler yearly and he would then be permitted to travel abroad.[6] While studying these languages, Abel published his first notable work in 1824, M\u00e9moire sur les \u00e9quations alg\u00e9briques o\u00f9 on d\u00e9montre l'impossibilit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9solution de l'\u00e9quation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du cinqui\u00e8me degr\u00e9[11] (Memoir on algebraic equations, in which the impossibility of solving the general equation of the fifth degree is proven). By 1823, Abel had at last proved the impossibility of solving the quintic equation in radicals (now referred to as the Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem). However, this paper was in an abstruse and difficult form, in part because he had restricted himself to only six pages in order to save money on printing. A more detailed proof was published in 1826 in the first volume of Crelle's Journal./nIn 1825, Abel wrote a personal letter to King Carl Johan of Norway/Sweden requesting permission to travel abroad. He was granted this permission, and in September 1825 he left Christiania together with four friends from university (Christian P.B Boeck, Balthazar M. Keilhau, Nicolay B. M\u00f8ller and Otto Tank). These four friends of Abel were traveling to Berlin and to the Alps to study geology. Abel wanted to follow them to Copenhagen and from there make his way to G\u00f6ttingen. The terms for his scholarship stipulated that he was to visit Gauss in G\u00f6ttingen and then continue to Paris. However, when he got as far as Copenhagen, he changed his plans. He wanted to follow his friends to Berlin instead, intending to visit G\u00f6ttingen and Paris afterwards.[6]/nOn the way, he visited the astronomer Heinrich Christian Schumacher in Altona, now a district of Hamburg. He then spent four months in Berlin, where he became well acquainted with August Leopold Crelle, who was then about to publish his mathematical journal, Journal f\u00fcr die reine und angewandte Mathematik. This project was warmly encouraged by Abel, who contributed much to the success of the venture. Abel contributed seven articles to it in its first year./nFrom Berlin Abel also followed his friends to the Alps. He went to Leipzig and Freiberg to visit Georg Amadeus Carl Friedrich Naumann and his brother the mathematician August Naumann. In Freiberg Abel did research in the theory of functions, particularly, elliptic, hyperelliptic, and a new class now known as abelian functions./nFrom Freiberg they went on to Dresden, Prague, Vienna, Trieste, Venice, Verona, Bolzano, Innsbruck, Luzern and Basel. From July 1826 Abel traveled on his own from Basel to Paris. Abel had sent most of his work to Berlin to be published in Crelle's Journal, but he had saved what he regarded as his most important work for the French Academy of Sciences, a theorem on addition of algebraic differentials. With the help of a painter, Johan G\u00f8rbitz, he found an apartment in Paris and continued his work on the theorem. He finished in October 1826 and submitted it to the academy. It was to be reviewed by Augustin-Louis Cauchy. Abel's work was scarcely known in Paris, and his modesty restrained him from proclaiming his research. The theorem was put aside and forgotten until his death./nAbel's limited finances finally compelled him to abandon his tour in January 1827. He returned to Berlin, and was offered a position as editor of Crelle's Journal, but opted out. By May 1827 he was back in Norway. His tour abroad was viewed as a failure.[by whom?] He had not visited Gauss in G\u00f6ttingen and he had not published anything in Paris. His scholarship was therefore not renewed and he had to take up a private loan in Norges Bank of 200 spesidaler. He never repaid this loan. He also started tutoring. He continued to send most of his work to Crelle's Journal. But in mid-1828 he published, in rivalry with Carl Jacobi, an important work on elliptic functions in Astronomische Nachrichten in Altona./nWhile in Paris, Abel contracted tuberculosis. At Christmas 1828, he traveled by sled to Froland, Norway, to visit his fianc\u00e9e. He became seriously ill on the journey. Although a temporary improvement allowed the couple to enjoy the holiday together, he died relatively soon after on 6 April 1829, just two days before a letter arrived from August Crelle telling Abel that Crelle had secured him an appointment as a professor at the University of Berlin.[citation needed]/nAbel showed that there is no general algebraic solution for the roots of a quintic equation, or any general polynomial equation of degree greater than four, in terms of explicit algebraic operations with the Abel-Ruffini theorem. To do this, he invented (independently of Galois) a branch of mathematics known as group theory,  which is invaluable not only in many areas of mathematics, but for much of physics as well. Abel sent a paper on the unsolvability of the quintic equation to Carl Friedrich Gauss, who proceeded to discard without a glance what he believed to be the worthless work of a crank.[12]/nAs a 16-year-old, Abel gave a rigorous proof of the binomial theorem valid for all numbers, extending Euler's result which had held only for rationals.[13][14] Abel wrote a fundamental work on the theory of elliptic integrals, containing the foundations of the theory of elliptic functions.\nWhile travelling to Paris he published a paper revealing the double periodicity of elliptic functions, which Adrien-Marie Legendre later described to Augustin-Louis Cauchy as \"a monument more lasting than bronze\" (borrowing a famous sentence by the Roman poet Horatius). The paper was, however, misplaced by Cauchy.[12]/nWhile abroad Abel had sent most of his work to Berlin to be published in the Crelle's Journal, but he had saved what he regarded as his most important work for the French Academy of Sciences, a theorem on addition of algebraic differentials. The theorem was put aside and forgotten until his death. While in Freiberg, Abel did research in the theory of functions, particularly, elliptic, hyperelliptic, and a new class now known as abelian functions./nIn 1823 Abel wrote a paper titled \"a general representation of the possibility to integrate all differential formulas\" (Norwegian: en alminnelig Fremstilling af Muligheten at integrere alle mulige Differential-Formler). He applied for funds at the university to publish it. However the work was lost, while being reviewed, never to be found thereafter.[6]/nAbel said famously of Carl Friedrich Gauss's writing style, \"He is like the fox, who effaces his tracks in the sand with his tail.\" Gauss replied to him by saying, \"No self-respecting architect leaves the scaffolding in place after completing his building.\"[15]/nUnder Abel's guidance, the prevailing obscurities of analysis began to be cleared, new fields were entered upon and the study of functions so advanced as to provide mathematicians with numerous ramifications along which progress could be made. His works, the greater part of which originally appeared in Crelle's Journal, were edited by Bernt Michael Holmboe and published in 1839 by the Norwegian government, and a more complete edition by Ludwig Sylow and Sophus Lie was published in 1881. The adjective \"abelian\", derived from his name, has become so commonplace in mathematical writing that it is conventionally spelled with a lower-case initial \"a\" (e.g., abelian group, abelian category, and abelian variety)./nOn 6 April 1929, four Norwegian stamps were issued for the centenary of Abel's death. His portrait appears on the 500-kroner banknote (version V) issued during 1978\u20131985. On 5 June 2002, four Norwegian stamps were issued in honour of Abel two months before the bicentenary of his birth. There is also a 20-kroner coin issued by Norway in his honour. A statue of Abel stands in Oslo, and crater Abel on the Moon was named after him. In 2002, the Abel Prize was established in his memory./nMathematician Felix Klein wrote about Abel:/nBut I would not like to part from this ideal type of researcher, such as has seldom appeared in the history of mathematics, without evoking a figure from another sphere who, in spite of his totally different field, still seems related. Thus, although Abel shared with many mathematicians a complete lack of musical talent, I will not sound absurd if I compare his kind of productivity and his personality with Mozart's. Thus one might erect a monument to this divinely inspired mathematician like the one to Mozart in Vienna: simple and unassuming he stands there listening, while graceful angels float about, playfully bringing him inspiration from another world.\nInstead, I must mention the very different type of memorial that was in fact erected to Abel in Christiania and which must greatly disappoint anyone familiar with his nature. On a towering, steep block of granite a youthful athlete of the Byronic type steps over two greyish sacrificial victims, his direction toward the heavens. If needed be, one might take the hero to be a symbol of the human spirit, but one ponders the deeper significance of the two monsters in vain. Are they the conquered quintic equations or elliptic functions? Or the sorrows and cares of his everyday life? The pedestal of the monument bears, in immense letters, the inscription ABEL.[16]", "1233990": "Erich Hecke (20 September 1887 \u2013 13 February 1947) was a German mathematician known for his work in number theory and the theory of modular forms./nHecke was born in Buk, Province of Posen, German Empire (now Pozna\u0144, Poland).[1] He obtained his doctorate in G\u00f6ttingen under the supervision of David Hilbert.[2]/nKurt Reidemeister and Heinrich Behnke were among his students.[2]/nIn 1933 Hecke signed the Loyalty Oath of German Professors to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist State, but was later known as being opposed to the Nazis.[3]/nHecke died in Copenhagen, Denmark.[4]/nAndr\u00e9 Weil, in the foreword to his text Basic Number Theory[5] says: \"To improve upon Hecke, in a treatment along classical lines of the theory of algebraic numbers, would be a futile and impossible task\", referring to Hecke's book \"Lectures on the Theory of Algebraic Numbers.\"[6]/nHis early work included establishing the functional equation for the Dedekind zeta function, with a proof based on theta functions.

Growing up loving baseball and math, Nichols fused the two passions together to start analyzing baseball in a stats-driven manner.[1] Her influence on the infant stages of the Sabermetrics movement in the 1980s-1990s can be depicted from various works such as Nichols' Law of Catcher Defense, her work collecting play-by-play data, and most notably her cocreation of Defensive Average. Nichols' assertiveness and knowledge has greatly influenced other notable baseball statisticians and paved the way for other women to enter the male dominated industry./nNichols grew up in Clarksville, Tennessee, as a baseball fan of the Cincinnati Reds.[1] She was able to bond with her father and brother through her admiration for baseball.[2] Along with baseball, she had a love for math and science.[2] Nichols attended Tennessee Tech University to get an undergraduate degree in physics.[1] She later went to Carnegie Mellon University to study computer science as a graduate student.[1]/nWhile studying computer science at Carnegie Mellon, Nichols came across Usenet, which is similar to the internet, but in the 1980s.[1] In the network, she started contributing to rec.sport.baseball, a blog-like page on Usenet where baseball analysts from the 1970s-80s discussed new approaches to analyzing the game with one another.[1] Contributors of rec.sport.baseball have become prominent figures in sports analytics, including the main contributors to the first editions of Baseball Prospectus, an organization that posts topics on baseball analytics that is still widely interacted with today.[1] Rec.sport.baseball is where Nichols first realized the importance of overlooked statistics such as on-base percentage that influenced team performance in a baseball game.[1] It was during her rec.sport.baseball days when she created Nichol's Law of Catcher Defense, the first of many physical marks she made on Sabermetrics. Nichol's Law of Catcher Defense states that \"a catcher's defensive reputation is inversely proportional to their offensive abilities.\"[citation needed]/nIn October 1983, an influential baseball statistician by the name of Bill James created Project Scoresheet, which called for a nationwide effort to collect play-by-play baseball data that was not recorded ever before.[1] Seeing this opportunity, Nichols and her husband, David Nichols, volunteered for the Pittsburgh branch to track game data.[1] Working on Project Scoresheet led Sherri and David to start attending annual conventions held by the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), a leading baseball analytics organization where the term \"sabermetrics\" stems from.[1] The annual conventions are where Sherri met Pete DeCoursey, who worked on Project Scoresheet in a different branch. While using the data collected through Project Scoresheet, the two joined heads to create the groundbreaking baseball metric called \"Defensive Average\".[1][2] Nichols used her computer science background and did all of the software engineering to develop the statistic.[1] Defensive Average is explained as \"the number of balls fielded by a player at a position divided by the number of balls hit to that fielder's zone of responsibility while he's playing that position.\"[2] The new metric allowed for a better way to quantify a player's defensive ability than the lackluster metrics available at the time. With the creation of Defensive Average, many baseball analysts found that previous defensive analysis methods were misleading and flawed. Around the same time she developed Defensive Average, from 1990-1995, Nichols also had a job in Silicon Valley as a software engineer for Adobe.[2] In 1995, when her daughter Susan was born, Nichols gradually removed herself from working on Defensive Average and other baseball analytics topics and passed the torch on to new management.[1]/nWhile Project Scoresheet was meeting its demise in 1989, a Project Scoresheet alumni and baseball analyst, David Smith, founded Retrosheet. Similar to Project Scoresheet, Retrosheet is a non-profit organization that collects box scores and play-by-play statistics from the entire history of baseball.[1] Nichols was chosen to be the vice president and treasurer of the new organization for her positive influences in Project Scoresheet and the SABR conventions. She held the position at Retrosheet until 2003.[1] In the first board meeting, Nichols revolutionized the way data scientists collected data by making all of Retrosheet's data available for free and open to the public.[2] The reasoning behind it was that money had been an issue that eventually brought Project Scoresheet down, and Nichols believed that sports teams and organizations would be more willing to collaborate with Retrosheet if they weren't asking for their money.[1] As expected, Retrosheet was incredibly successful. Retrosheet has collected data for 182,911 out of the 194,908 MLB games between 1901 and 2018.[1] Nichols' work on Retrosheet has directly provided data to well-known databases and baseball analytics organizations such as Baseball-Reference, FanGraphs, and Baseball Prospectus.[1]/nDuring her time working on baseball analytics, Nichols only received one offer from a professional baseball team's front office. It was a non-paid job for the Pittsburgh Pirates to collect and analyze data for a short period of time. She decided to turn down the offer, and no other teams reached out to her ever again.[1] Although she did not work for any front office in baseball, she is known to have influenced many data scientists in baseball during the 1980s-1990s. Even as a woman in a male-dominated field such as baseball analytics, Nichols' assertiveness and wealth in knowledge greatly influenced big names in sabermetrics such as Bill James, David Smith, and Gary Huckabay.[1] Her contribution in the industry has also led to an increase in the number of women working in the sports business field.[1]/nSince working in the Retrosheet team, Nichols has not worked in the sports analytics field. She recently stated that she never intended on pursuing baseball analytics as a career, and how it was merely a hobby for her.[1] Currently, Nichols is a part of a truancy board and city planning commission in Redmond, Washington, and works for the American Civil Liberties Union.[2][3]", "8606878": "Giovanni Frattini (8 January 1852 \u2013 21 July 1925) was an Italian mathematician, noted for his contributions to group theory./nFrattini entered the University of Rome in 1869, where he studied mathematics with Giuseppe Battaglini, Eugenio Beltrami, and Luigi Cremona, obtaining his Laurea in 1875./nIn 1885 he published a paper where he defined a certain subgroup of a finite group.

She was always known as May by her friends and family. Her parents were Thomas Winston, a country doctor, and Caroline Eliza Mumford. Thomas Winston had been born in Wales but had come to the United States at the age of two years when his parents emigrated. Caroline had been a teacher before her marriage, teaching French, art and mathematics. Mary was one of her parents' seven surviving children. She was taught at home by her mother, who taught herself Latin and Greek so that she could prepare her children for a university education. Her mother had also studied geology, taking a correspondence course with the Field Museum in Chicago./nShe and her older brother enrolled at the University of Wisconsin in 1884, when she was 15.  She graduated with honors in mathematics in 1889.[1]  After teaching at Downer College in Fox Lake, Wisconsin, she applied for a fellowship at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania in 1890. Charlotte Scott was the professor of mathematics at Bryn Mawr and she encouraged Winston to apply again for the fellowship in the following year having narrowly failed to gain the fellowship at her first attempt. Winston taught for a second year at Downer College and she was awarded the fellowship the next year but chose to continue her studies at the University of Chicago which was opening on 1 October 1892, spending the year 1891\u201392 at Bryn Mawr College.[2] Winston was awarded a fellowship to study at Chicago and she spent the year 1892-93 there./nAt the International Mathematical Congress held at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, she met Felix Klein, who urged her to study at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.  With financial assistance from Christine Ladd-Franklin, she arrived in Germany at the same time as two other American students, Margaret Maltby and Grace Chisholm.  Her first paper, on the topic of hypergeometric functions, was published in 1894. The Association of Collegiate Alumnae gave Winston a fellowship to fund her during the academic year 1895\u201396. She graduated magna cum laude and was awarded her PhD upon the publication of her dissertation, \"\u00dcber den Hermite'schen Fall der Lam\u00e9'schen Differentialgleichungen\" (On the Hermitian case of the Lam\u00e9 differential equations), in the summer of 1896 and was examined in July 1896.[3]  She had to have the thesis published before she could be awarded a doctorate and she returned to the United States with the manuscript of the work intending to publish it there. However, no publisher in the United States was able to print the mathematical symbols in her thesis so she had to return it to G\u00f6ttingen. It was published in 1897 and she received the doctorate magna cum laude in that year. Grace Chisholm had been awarded a doctorate in 1895, so Winston became the second woman, and the first American, student to be awarded a doctorate by G\u00f6ttingen, as Sofia Kovalevskaya was awarded a doctorate by G\u00f6ttingen in 1874 but she was never allowed to enroll as a student. She published only one further article, the first English translation of the 1900 lecture by David Hilbert presenting the first ten of his famous problems, issued in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society.[4]/nAfter she returned to the United States, Winston was appointed to teach at St Joseph's High School in St Joseph, Missouri in September 1896. After a year Newson became head of the one-person mathematics department at Kansas State Agricultural College (now Kansas State University) in Manhattan, Kansas. She was the only member of the department. In 1900, she left that job and was married on 21 July 1900 to Henry Byron Newson in Chicago. Henry B. Newson (1860\u20131910) was head of the mathematics department at the University of Kansas and had published the book Continuous groups of projective transformations treated synthetically (1895). After his marriage he published the books: Graphic Algebra for Secondary Schools (1905); The five types of projective transformations of the plane (1895); and Theory of collineations (1911). Mary Newson, as she now became, resigned her position at the Kansas State Agriculture College and over the next ten years they had three children (Caroline born in 1901, Josephine born in 1903, and Henry Winston born in 1909).[5][6]  But Henry B. Newson died of a heart attack in 1910. Although she was not now employed as a mathematician, Winston did translate Hilbert's 'Mathematical problems', which he had delivered in 1900, into English and her 40-page translation (made with Hilbert's permission) was published in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society in 1902./nEventually, Newson found a teaching position in 1913 at Washburn College in Kansas.  Newson was one of eight Washburn faculty members to sign a petition defending a political science professor fired because of his political views. All of the signers left Washburn within a year or two, including Newson, who became department head at Eureka College in her native Illinois until her retirement in 1942.[4]/nIn 1940 she wrote a review of the book Thomas Jefferson and Mathematics, by David Eugene Smith./nAfter she finished teaching at Eureka College, Newson moved to Lake Dalecarlia in Lowell, Indiana. This was a village beside a picturesque artificial lake which Newson loved and had spent vacations at throughout her life. In 1956, when she was 87 years old, she moved into a nursing home in Poolesville, Maryland, where she was close to her daughter Caroline Beshers. She died one day after the death of her brother Ambrose Par\u00e9 Winston who had been a professor of economics.[citation needed][7][8]/nNewson was one of only 22 women to join the American Mathematical Society before 1900.[4] In 1940, she was honored by the Women's Centennial Congress as one of a hundred women in positions not open to women a century earlier.[1] International relations was a hobby of Newson and her three children started the Mary Winston Newson Memorial Lecture on International Relations at Eureka College.[9]", "72340642": "Gregory Scott Chirikjian (born 1966) is an American roboticist and applied mathematician, primarily working in the field of kinematics, motion planning, computer vision, group theory applications in engineering, and the mechanics of macromolecules.\nHe currently serves as the head and professor at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore.[1]\nBefore joining NUS, he was a professor at the Johns Hopkins University.[1]\nHe is well known for his theoretical contributions to the kinematics of hyper-redundant (snake-like and continuum) robots and stochastic methods on Lie groups./nChirikjian received a bachelor's degree from Johns Hopkins University (JHU), Baltimore, MD, USA, in 1988, and the Ph.D. degree from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA, in 1992.[2]\nIn the same year, he joined the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University as an assistant professor.\nHe was promoted to associate professor and full professor in 1997 and 2001, respectively.\nFrom 2004 to 2007, he was the Chair of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University.\nFrom 2014 to 2015, he served as a program director for the US National Robotics Initiative, which included responsibilities in the Robust Intelligence cluster in the Information and Intelligent Systems Division of CISE at the National Science Foundation (NSF).[3]\nIn 2019, he joined the National University of Singapore and has been serving as the head and professor of the Department of Mechanical Engineering.[1][4]/nChirikjian was named NSF's Young Investigator in 1993,[1] Presidential Faculty Fellow in 1994,[1] and was a recipient of the ASME Pi Tau Sigma Gold Medal in 1996.[1]\nHe was elected as a fellow of ASME in 2008,[1] and a fellow of IEEE in 2010 for his contributions to hyper-redundant manipulators.[2]\nIn 2019, he received the American Society of Mechanical Engineers' Machine Design Award.[5]", "1070245": "Szolem Mandelbrojt (10 January 1899 \u2013 23 September 1983) was a Polish-French mathematician who specialized in mathematical analysis.

His family soon moved to D\u00fcsseldorf, where he grew up. He attended several different universities in Germany studying the philosophical works of Heidegger and Husserl, but finally decided that mathematics was his real calling.

He is considered to be the father of library science, documentation, and information science in India and is widely known throughout the rest of the world for his fundamental thinking in the field. His birthday is observed every year as the National Librarian Day in India.[3]/nHe was a university librarian and professor of library science at Banaras Hindu University (1945\u201347) and professor of library science at the University of Delhi (1947\u201355). The last appointment made him director of the first Indian school of librarianship to offer higher degrees. He was president of the Indian Library Association from 1944 to 1953. In 1957 he was elected an honorary member of the International Federation for Information and Documentation (FID) and was made a vice-president for life of the Library Association of Great Britain.[4]/nRanganathan was born on 9 August 1892 in Siyali, Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu in an orthodox Hindu Brahmin family.[5][1] His birth date is also written 12 August 1892 but he himself wrote his birth date 9 August 1892 in his book,  The Five Laws of Library Science./nRanganathan began his professional life as a mathematician; he earned B.A. and M.A. degrees in mathematics from Madras Christian College in his home province, and then went on to earn a teaching license in 1917.[6] His lifelong goal was to teach mathematics, and he was successively a member of the mathematics faculties at universities in Mangalore, Coimbatore and Madras. As a mathematics professor, he published papers mainly on the history of mathematics. His career as an educator was somewhat hindered by stammering (a difficulty he gradually overcame in his professional life). The Government of India awarded Padmashri to Dr. S.R. Ranganathan in 1957 for valuable contributions to Library Science.[7]/nIn 1923, the University of Madras created the post of University Librarian to oversee their poorly organized collection. Among the 900 applicants for the position, none had any formal training in librarianship, and Ranganathan's handful of papers satisfied the search committee's requirement that the candidate should have a research background. His sole knowledge of librarianship came from an Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica article he read days before the interview. Ranganathan was initially reluctant to pursue the position (he had forgotten about his application by the time he was called for an interview there). To his own surprise, he received the appointment and accepted the position in January 1924.[1]/nAt first, Ranganathan found the solitude of the position was intolerable. In a matter of weeks, complaining of total boredom, he went back to the university administration to beg for his teaching position back. A deal was struck that Ranganathan would travel to London to study contemporary Western practices in librarianship, and that, if he returned and still rejected librarianship as a career, the mathematics lectureship would be his again.[8]/nRanganathan travelled to University College London, which at that time housed the only graduate degree program in library science in Britain. At University College, he earned marks only slightly above average, but his mathematical genius latched onto the problem of classification, a subject typically taught by rote in library programs of the time. As an outsider, he focused on what he perceived to be flaws with the popular decimal classification, and began to explore new possibilities on his own.[9]/nHe also devised the Acknowledgment of Duplication, which states that any system of classification of information necessarily implies at least two different classifications for any given datum. He anecdotally proved this with the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) by taking several books and showing how each might be classified with two totally different resultant DDC numbers.[10] For example, a book on \"warfare in India\" could be classified under \"warfare\" or \"India\". Even a general book on warfare could be classified under \"warfare\", \"history\", \"social organisation\", \"Indian essays\", or many other headings, depending upon the viewpoint, needs, and prejudices of the classifier. To Ranganathan, a structured, step-by-step system acknowledging each facet of the topic of the work was immensely preferable to the anarchy and \"intellectual laziness\" (as he termed it) of the DDC. Given the poor technology for information retrieval available at that time, the implementation of this concept was a tremendous step forwards for the science of information retrieval./nHe began drafting the system that was ultimately to become colon classification while in England, and refined it as he returned home, even going so far as to reorder the ship's library on the voyage back to India. He initially got the idea for the system from seeing a set of Meccano in a toy store in London. Ranganathan returned with great interest for libraries and librarianship and a vision of its importance for the Indian nation. The system remains useful even into the modern times. He returned to and held the position of University Librarian at the University of Madras for twenty years. During that time, he helped to found the Madras Library Association, and lobbied actively for the establishment of free public libraries throughout India and for the creation of a comprehensive national library.[10]/nRanganathan was considered by many to be a workaholic. During his two decades in Madras, he consistently worked 13-hour days, seven days a week, without taking a vacation for the entire time. Although he married in November 1928, he returned to work the afternoon following the marriage ceremony. A few years later, he and his wife Sarada had a son. The couple remained married until Ranganathan's death./nThe first few years of Ranganathan's tenure at Madras were years of deliberation and analysis as he addressed the problems of library administration and classification.[11] It was during this period that he produced what have come to be known as his two greatest legacies: his five laws of library science (1931) and the colon classification system (1933).[12]/nRegarding the political climate at the time, Ranganathan took his position at the University of Madras in 1924. Gandhi had been imprisoned in 1922 and was released around the time that Ranganathan was taking that job. Ranganathan sought to institute massive changes to the library system and to write about such things as open access and education for all which essentially had the potential to enable the masses and encourage civil discourse (and disobedience). Although there is no evidence that Ranganathan did any of this for political reasons, his changes to the library had the result of educating more people, making information available to all, and even aiding women and minorities in the information-seeking process./nThe Northern Ireland crisis got an unexpected metaphorical reference in a book by S. R. Ranganathan, as \"making an Ulster of the ... law of parsimony\", complaining about the harmful effects of low budget on the good functioning of a library./nAfter two decades of serving as librarian at Madras\u00a0\u2013 a post he had intended to keep until his retirement\u00a0\u2013, Ranganathan retired from his position after conflicts with a new university vice-chancellor became intolerable. At the age of 54, he submitted his resignation and, after a brief bout with depression, accepted a professorship in library science at Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi, his last formal academic position, in August 1945. There, he catalogued the university's collection; by the time he left four years later, he had classified over 100,000 items personally./nRanganathan headed the Indian Library Association from 1944 to 1953, but was never a particularly adept administrator, and left amid controversy when the Delhi Public Library chose to use the Dewey Decimal Classification system instead of his own Colon Classification. He held an honorary professorship at Delhi University from 1949 to 1955 and helped build that institution's library science programs with S. Dasgupta, a former student of his.[8] While at Delhi, Ranganathan drafted a comprehensive 30-year plan for the development of an advanced library system for the whole of India.[13] In 1951, Ranganathan released an album on Folkways Records entitled, Readings from the Ramayana: In Sanskrit Bhagavad Gita./nRanganathan briefly moved to the Zurich, Switzerland, from 1955 to 1957, when his son married a European woman; the unorthodox relationship did not sit well with Ranganathan, although his time in Zurich allowed him to expand his contacts within the European library community, where he gained a significant following. However, he soon returned to India and settled in the city of Bangalore, where he spent the rest of his life. While in Zurich, though, he endowed a professorship at Madras University in honour of his wife of thirty years, largely as an ironic gesture in retaliation for the persecution he suffered for many years at the hands of that university's administration./nRanganathan's final major achievement was the establishment of the Documentation Research and Training Centre as a department and research centre in the Indian Statistical Institute in Bangalore in 1962, where he served as honorary director for five years. In 1965, the Indian government honoured him for his contributions to the field with a rare title of \"National Research Professor.\"/nIn the final years of his life, Ranganathan suffered from ill health and was largely confined to his bed. On 27 September 1972, he finally succumbed to complications from bronchitis.[14]/nUpon the 1992 centenary of his birth, several biographical volumes and collections of essays on Ranganathan's influence were published in his honour. Ranganathan's autobiography, published serially during his life, is titled A Librarian Looks Back./nRanganathan dedicated his book The Five Laws of Library Science to his maths tutor at Madras Christian College, Edward Burns Ross.[15] Ranganathan\u2019s influence was analyzed bibliometrically in 1992.[16] His birthday, August 12, has been denoted National Librarians' Day in India.[17]", "70571197": "Bertha Irene Hart was an American mathematician.

He was probably born in Mantua and spent most of his life in Rome.[1] He is most famous today for his experiment in which he unknowingly created the first working barometer.[2] Though he was best known for his work in mathematics and physics, little of his work in either survives.[3]/nIn 1630,[1] Giovanni Battista Baliani sent a letter to Galileo Galilei after he noticed that his siphon could not raise water more than about 10 m (34\u00a0feet).[4] Galileo proposed that a vacuum held the water up and that it could not hold any more.[5] At the time the existence of vacuums was controversial.[5]/nGalileo's ideas, presented in his Discorsi (Two New Sciences), reached Rome in December 1638.[6] Upon reading Galileo's theory, physicists Gasparo Berti and father Raffaello Magiotti decided to seek a better way to test the possibility of producing a vacuum. Magiotti devised such an experiment. Four accounts of the experiment exist, all written some years later.[6] No exact date was given, but since Two New Sciences reached Rome in December 1638, and Berti died before January 2, 1644, science historian W. E. Knowles Middleton places the event to sometime between 1639 and 1643.[6] Present were Berti, Magiotti, Jesuit polymath Athanasius Kircher, and probably Jesuit physicist Niccol\u00f2 Zucchi.[6]/nBerti built an 11 m lead tube, filled it with water, and sealed both ends. He submerged one end in a basin of water and unsealed it. Though some of the water flowed out, much of it remained, filling the tube to about 10 m (34\u00a0feet)[7] above the water level in the basin, the same height as in Baliani's siphon./nWhat was most important about this experiment was that the lowering water had left a space above it in the tube which had no intermediate contact with air to fill it up. Berti claimed that in this space was a vacuum.[5] His claim was strongly contested however, and multiple experiments were performed attempting to disprove the existence of a vacuum. Berti's experiment led to Evangelista Torricelli's research into the weight of air and his invention of the barometer./nBerti held a chair of mathematics at the University of Rome La Sapienza.

On pp. 151-2 Muses states, \u201cBoth Boehme\u2019s and Freher\u2019s outstanding message philosophically is that philosophy is not a dodge, game, or only some kind of artistic exercise, but a solid enterprise of most productive value \u2013 able to yield concrete results of a most extended nature in terms of deep changes in attitude and understanding, leading to actions toward and realization of the intrinsic nobility possible to and desired by mankind.\u201d The two-year delay between finishing the thesis work (1949) and its recognition in the grant of the Ph.D. (1951) is not explained./nIn 1991 the book In All Her Names: Explorations of the Feminine in Divinity was published by Harper San Francisco.

In chapter 5, entitled \u201cFonts Et Origo: Some Traditions Uniquely Illuminating the Structure and Meaning of Time Systems,\u201d Muses provides historical sources for his claim, \u201cThat the nature of time is inextricably bound up with the origins of evil. . .\u201d (p. 128).

His domain, which before was a universally symbiotic cosmos, had now become the frenetically struggling, predominantly predatory one we all know, with Nature trying still to smile through her travail.

While many open questions remain, in particular about defining the relations of these levels, Muses pictured a wide range of applicability for this concept.

Furthermore, the Lilavati contained excellent problems and it is thought that Bhaskara's intention may have been that a student of 'Lilavati' should concern himself with the mechanical application of the method.[citation needed]/nHis B\u012bjaganita (\"Algebra\") was a work in twelve chapters. It was the first text to recognize that a positive number has two square roots (a positive and negative square root).[25] His work B\u012bjaganita is effectively a treatise on algebra and contains the following topics:/nBhaskara derived a cyclic, chakravala method for solving indeterminate quadratic equations of the form ax2 + bx + c = y.[25] Bhaskara's method for finding the solutions of the problem Nx2 + 1 = y2 (the so-called \"Pell's equation\") is of considerable importance.[23]/nThe Siddh\u0101nta Shiromani (written in 1150) demonstrates Bhaskara's knowledge of trigonometry, including the sine table and relationships between different trigonometric functions. He also developed spherical trigonometry, along with other interesting trigonometrical results. In particular Bhaskara seemed more interested in trigonometry for its own sake than his predecessors who saw it only as a tool for calculation. Among the many interesting results given by Bhaskara, results found in his works include computation of sines of angles of 18 and 36 degrees, and the now well known formulae for \n\n\n\nsin\n\u2061\n\n(\n\na\n+\nb\n\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\sin \\left(a+b\\right)}\n\n and \n\n\n\nsin\n\u2061\n\n(\n\na\n\u2212\nb\n\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\sin \\left(a-b\\right)}\n\n./nHis work, the Siddh\u0101nta Shiromani, is an astronomical treatise and contains many theories not found in earlier works.[citation needed] Preliminary concepts of infinitesimal calculus and mathematical analysis, along with a number of results in trigonometry, differential calculus and integral calculus that are found in the work are of particular interest./nEvidence suggests Bhaskara was acquainted with some ideas of differential calculus.[25]  Bhaskara also goes deeper into the 'differential calculus' and suggests the differential coefficient vanishes at an extremum value of the function, indicating knowledge of the concept of 'infinitesimals'.[26]/nMadhava (1340\u20131425) and the Kerala School mathematicians (including Parameshvara) from the 14th century to the 16th century expanded on Bhaskara's work and further advanced the development of calculus in India.[citation needed]/nUsing an astronomical model developed by Brahmagupta in the 7th century, Bh\u0101skara accurately defined many astronomical quantities, including, for example, the length of the sidereal year, the time that is required for the Earth to orbit the Sun, as approximately 365.2588 days which is the same as in Suryasiddhanta.[28] The modern accepted measurement is 365.25636 days, a difference of 3.5 minutes.[29]/nHis mathematical astronomy text Siddhanta Shiromani is written in two parts: the first part on mathematical astronomy and the second part on the sphere./nThe twelve chapters of the first part cover topics such as:/nThe second part contains thirteen chapters on the sphere.

She was one of the pioneers of what would later become known as chaos theory.[2] Along with J. E. Littlewood, Cartwright saw many solutions to a problem which would later be seen as an example of the butterfly effect./nMary Cartwright was born on 17 December 1900, in Aynho, Northamptonshire, where her father William Digby was vicar. Through her grandmother Jane Holbech, she descended from poet John Donne and William Mompesson, Vicar of Eyam.[3][4] She had four siblings, two older and two younger: John (born 1896), Nigel (born 1898), Jane (born 1905), and William (born 1907).[5] Her early education was at Leamington High School (1912\u20131915), and then at Gravely Manor School in Boscombe (1915\u20131916) before completion in Godolphin School in Salisbury (1916\u20131919).[6]/nCartwright studied mathematics at St Hugh's College, Oxford, graduating in 1923 with a first class degree. She was the first woman to attain the final degree lectures and to obtain a first. She briefly taught at Alice Ottley School in Worcester and Wycombe Abbey School in Buckinghamshire before returning to Oxford in 1928 to read for her D.Phil. Cartwright was supervised by G. H. Hardy in her doctoral studies. During the academic year 1928\u20139 Hardy was at Princeton, so it was E. C. Titchmarsh who took over the duties as a supervisor. Her thesis \"The Zeros of Integral Functions of Special Types\" was examined by J. E. Littlewood, whom she met for the first time as an external examiner in her oral examination for that 1930 D.Phil.[4]/nIn 1930, Cartwright was awarded a Yarrow Research Fellowship and went to Girton College, Cambridge to continue working on the topic of her doctoral thesis. Attending Littlewood's lectures, she solved one of the open problems which he posed. Her mathematical theorem, now known as Cartwright's Theorem, gives an estimate for the maximum modulus of an analytic function that takes the same value no more than p times in the unit disc. To prove the theorem she used a new approach, applying a technique introduced by Lars Ahlfors for conformal mappings.[7][8]/nThroughout her career, Cartwright wrote over ninety articles on several different mathematical concepts. Her contributions extended to topics such as the Dirichlet series, Abel summation, directions of Borel spreads, analytic functions regular on the unit disk, the zeros of integral functions, maximum and minimum moduli, and functions of finite order in an angle.[8]/nIn 1936, Cartwright became director of studies in mathematics at Girton College. In 1938, she began work on a new project which had a major impact on the direction of her research. The Radio Research Board of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research produced a memorandum regarding certain differential equations which came out of modelling radio and radar work.[9] They asked the London Mathematical Society if they could help find a mathematician who could work on these problems and she became interested. The dynamics lying behind the problems were unfamiliar to Cartwright, so she approached Littlewood for help with this aspect. They began to collaborate studying the equations, which greatly surprised the two:/nFor something to do we went on and on at the thing with no earthly prospect of \"results\"; suddenly the whole vista of the dramatic fine structure of solutions stared us in the face.[10]/nThe fine structure described here is today seen to be a typical instance of the butterfly effect. The collaboration led to important results which have greatly influenced the direction that the modern theory of dynamical systems has taken.[11][12] Although the duo did not supply the answer in time, they succeeded in directing the engineers' attention away from faulty equipment towards practical ways of compensating for the electrical \"noise\"\u2014or erratic fluctuations\u2014being produced.[9]/nIn 1945, Cartwright simplified Hermite's elementary proof of the irrationality of \u03c0. She set her version of the proof as a Tripos question, later published in an appendix to Sir Harold Jeffreys' book Scientific Inference.[13] In 1947, she was elected to be a Fellow of the Royal Society;[14] although she was not the first woman to be elected to that Society, she was the first female mathematician.[11][12]/nCartwright was appointed Mistress of Girton in 1948 and a Reader in the Theory of Functions in Cambridge in 1959 until 1968.[4] From 1957 to 1960, she was president of the Cambridge Association of University Women.[15] After retiring from Girton, she was a visiting professor at Brown University from 1968 to 1969 and at Claremont Graduate School from 1969 to 1970.[15] Cartwright died in Cambridge, on 3 April 1998 at the age of 97.[8]/nCartwright was the first woman:/nIn 1968, Cartwright became the first woman to receive the De Morgan Medal, the highest award of the London Mathematical Society,[17][18] and was elected an Honorary Fellow of The Royal Society of Edinburgh (HonFRSE).[19] In 1969, she received the distinction of being honoured by the Queen, becoming Dame Mary Cartwright, Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire./nCartwright died in Midfield Lodge Nursing Home in Cambridge in 1998.[6]", "2577671": "Francesco Barozzi (9 August 1537 \u2013 23 November 1604), in Latin Franciscus Barocius, was an Italian mathematician, astronomer and humanist./nBarozzi was born on the island of Crete, at Candia (now Heraklion), at the time a Venetian possession. He was  the son of Iacopo Barozzi, a Venetian nobleman, and Fiordiligi Dorro. Barozzi was educated at Padua, and studied mathematics at the University of Padua.  The estate on Crete, inherited from his father, yielded him an income of 4,000 ducats, though he seems to have lived in Venice for most of his life.  He was thus able to function as an independent scholar, and does not appear to have held any academic posts, although he did lecture on the De sphaera of Sacrobosco at the University of Padua in 1559./nBarozzi translated many works of the ancients, including Proclus\u2019s edition of Euclid's Elements (published in Venice in 1560), as well as mathematical works by Hero, Pappus of Alexandria, and Archimedes./nBarozzi helped in the general reappraisal of the geometry of Euclid, and corresponded with numerous mathematicians, including the German Jesuit Christopher Clavius.  His original works include Cosmographia in quatuor libros distributa summo ordine, miraque facilitate, ac brevitate ad magnam Ptolemaei mathematicam constructionem, ad universamque astrologiam institutens (1585), which he dedicated to the Duke of Urbino.  This work concerns the cosmography and mathematical systems of Ptolemy.  Barozzi also discussed 13 ways of drawing a parallel line in his Admirandum illud geometricum problema tredecim modis demonstratum quod docet duas lineas in eodem plano designare, quae nunquam invicem coincidant, etiam si in infinitum protrahantur: et quanto longius producuntur, tanto sibiinuicem propiores euadant (1586)./nIn his Opusculum: in quo una Oratio et due Questiones, altera de Certitude et altera de Medietate Mathematicarum continentur, Barozzi stressed that \"the certitude of mathematics is contained in the syntactic rigor of demonstrations.\" Barozzi dedicated this work to Daniele Barbaro.[1]/nHe also wrote Rythmomachia (1572), which he dedicated to Camille Paleotti, a Senator of Bologna, a work that is based on the mathematical game of the same name, also known as \"The Philosophers' Game.\"/nAs an antiquarian, he copied many Greek inscriptions on Crete.  His collection of inscriptions was later inherited by his nephew Iacopo Barozzi (1562\u20131617), who edited and expanded it.  This collection was later acquired in 1629 by the University of Oxford.

He also published a special edition of  Oracula Leonis in 1577, a collection of cryptic prophecies attributed to the Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise and dedicated to the Cretan governor, Giacomo Foscarini./nAround 1583, Barozzi was tried by the Inquisition on an unknown charge and found guilty.  In 1587, he was charged with apostasy, heresy, and for engaging in the occult.  He was accused of causing a torrential rain storm in Crete.  Found guilty, he was forced to donate silver crosses at the cost of 100 ducats and received a suspended prison sentence.

The second chapter deals with the six types of problems found in Al-Khwarizmi's book,[9] but some of which, especially those of \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x^{2}}\n\n, were now worked out directly instead of first solving for \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n and accompanied with geometrical illustrations and proofs.[5][9] The third chapter contains examples of quadratic irrationalities as solutions and coefficients.[9] The fourth chapter shows how these irrationalities are used to solve problems involving polygons. The rest of the book contains solutions for sets of indeterminate equations, problems of application in realistic situations, and problems involving unrealistic situations intended for recreational mathematics.[9]/nA number of Islamic mathematicians wrote commentaries on this work, including al-I\u1e63\u1e6dakhr\u012b al-\u1e24\u0101sib and \u02bfAli ibn A\u1e25mad al-\u02bfImr\u0101n\u012b (d. 955-6),[12] but both commentaries are now lost.[4]/nIn Europe, similar material to this book is found in the writings of Fibonacci, and some sections were incorporated and improved upon in the Latin work of John of Seville, Liber mahameleth.[9] A partial translation to Latin was done in the 14th century by William of Luna, and in the 15th century the whole work also appeared in a Hebrew translation by Mordekhai Finzi.[9]/nAbu Kamil describes a number of systematic procedures for finding integral solutions for indeterminate equations.[4] It is also the earliest known Arabic work where solutions are sought to the type of indeterminate equations found in Diophantus's Arithmetica.

This led to her being asked by Adam and Charles Black, publishers of the Review, who also published the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, to write biographies of a number of famous scientists for the ninth edition of the encyclopedia.[15]/nThis led to a number of other commissions, including the publication of the article on astronomy for the Catholic Encyclopedia.[8]/nDuring her career she wrote reviews of many books, including some written in French, German, Greek, or Italian.[16] In 1885, she published her best known work, A Popular History of Astronomy during the Nineteenth Century.[8] This book became commonly used for its discussion of the spectroscope.[17]/nIn 1888 she spent three months at the observatory at the Cape of Good Hope.[17]/nIn the autumn of 1890, Clerke and her brother Aubrey were founding members of the British Astronomical Association.[18]/nIn 1893, Clerke was awarded the Actonian Prize of 100 guineas by the Royal Institution. As a member of the British Astronomical Association she attended its meetings regularly, as well as those of the Royal Astronomical Society. In 1903, with Margaret Lindsay Huggins, she was elected an honorary member of the Royal Astronomical Society, a rank previously held only by three other women, Caroline Herschel and Mary Somerville (in 1835), and Anne Sheepshanks (in 1862).[19]/nShe died of pneumonia in 1907 at her home in South Kensington.[17]/nAgnes and Ellen were devout Catholics all their lives.

For about two years more years she continued studies at Oxford, in theoretical fluid mechanics\u2014and she then moved to the University of Durham to complete her DPhil in 1964.  During this time she held temporary Lectureships at both Durham and Newcastle and in 1964 began a Lectureship that started her long association with UCL.  From her Lectureship she advanced to a Readership in 1971 and was appointed to a Professorship in 1986.  The afore-mentioned departmental newsletter that recapped her accomplishments after her death expresses the belief that Brown was the first female in the UK to be appointed to a professorship in Mathematics, but Joan E. Walsh was promoted to a professorship in mathematics at the University of Manchester in 1974.[4]/nBrown's department described her as an outstanding teacher and someone with an international reputation for her research.[1]  She had a productive partnership in fluid dynamics with UCL colleague Keith Stewartson\u2014who also arrived at UCL in 1964. Quoting from the afore-mentioned departmental newsletter, \" Together they published 29 papers and pioneered early developments of 'triple-deck' theory, which, in turn, enabled resolution of long-standing questions in steady and unsteady trailing-edge flows, and addressed associated important aerodynamic applications.

After attending Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Gainsborough (now Queen Elizabeth's High School) he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1708, and becoming minor fellow in 1714, major fellow in 1715 and senior fellow in 1739, was chosen Master in 1742, in succession to Richard Bentley.[1] From 1716 to 1760 he was Plumian Professor of Astronomy, and he died in the Master's Lodge at Trinity./nIn February 1719 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.[2]/nBesides editing two works by his cousin, Roger Cotes, who was his predecessor in the Plumian chair, he published A Compleat System of Opticks in 1738, which gained him the sobriquet of Old Focus, and Harmonics, or the Philosophy of Musical Sounds in 1749./nSmith never married but lived with his unmarried sister Elzimar (1683\u20131758) in the lodge at Trinity College. Although he is often portrayed as a rather reclusive character, John Byrom's journal shows that in the 1720s and 1730s Smith could be quite sociable. Yet ill health, particularly gout, took its toll and severely inhibited his academic work and social activities. He died at the lodge on 2 February 1768, and on 8 February he was buried in Trinity College Chapel, the funeral oration being delivered by Thomas Zouch./nAccording to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Smith helped to spread Isaac Newton's ideas in Europe and \"Newton's successes in optics and mechanics dominated Smith's scientific career\"./nIn his will Smith left \u00a33500 South Sea stock to the University of Cambridge.

(July 5, 1842 - April 17, 1913) was the first president of Marquette College (now Marquette University) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin./nJoseph Frigge was born in Paderborn, Westphalia, the son of Frederick Frigge and Elisabeth Zeppenfeld.[1] He was the second of eight children, two of whom died in infancy. In 1854, his family emigrated to America,[2] where they eventually established a home in Cincinnati, Ohio.[3]  His early education took place at St. Xavier College (now Xavier University) in Cincinnati, and he entered the Society of Jesus at St. Stanislaus Seminary in Florissant, Missouri on July 10, 1862, changing his surname at this time to Rigge and taking the \"F\" as a middle initial.[1]/nAfter his studies at St. Stanislaus Seminary, he spent five years teaching English grammar and German at St. Louis University in Missouri and St. Xavier College in his hometown of Cincinnati, before entering Woodstock College in Maryland for studies in philosophy and theology preparatory to the priesthood. Here he was ordained in 1877, after which he returned to teaching math, German, physics and astronomy at St. Louis University.[1]/nRigge was appointed President of Marquette College in Milwaukee just as construction was nearing completion in spring of 1881. There, with the help of five professors, the work of teaching began with only 35 students. However, as a strong reputation for discipline and academics at Marquette College spread, the register of students expanded to 77 by the year's end.[4]/nTo bring attention to the new school, Rigge proposed to invite the public to an illustrated lecture on the topic of sound, in which he explained many of the latest inventions of the day. The result was that others began to seek his assistance in public expositions; the city's chief electrician even wrote to Rigge to volunteer his assistance at future lectures.[4]/nIts reputation established and its class size doubled, Rigge handed over the reins of the college to I. J. Boudreaux in 1882, taking on the role of Assistant Superior and continuing to teach science and German until 1883.[4]/nWhen Michael P. Dowling was installed as President of Creighton University in Omaha in July 1885, among his first faculty requests was that Rigge be brought on as head of the science departments.[5]  Upon his arrival, on August 21, 1885, he found that the university's benefactor, John A. Creighton, had bestowed upon the science department a large telescope. It was housed in a room in the chemistry building, requiring it to be rolled in and out over rough ground for use. Rigge pointed out that, in addition to making its use difficult and infrequent, this jostling would eventually cause damage to the precision of the instrument. Creighton was approached about the matter and by October, work had begun on Creighton University Observatory, which would properly house the instrument and allow for the fullest use of its capabilities.[6][7][8]/nRigge's scientific lectures, which featured many new and unique experiments, gained the notice of the student body as well as the public. He was the first to analyze the petroleum supply in Wyoming, publishing an article on the subject in The Scientific American Supplement.[9] These and other contributions to the prestige of the science department caught the attention of Creighton, and as a result he lavished the department with donations, allowing Rigge to leave a well-equipped Chemistry and Physics Department when he left Creighton in 1894.[10][11]/nRigge also served as chaplain of the city jail during his time at Creighton, where he spent much time with those who had been condemned to death.  He sometimes was asked to accompany one of these to the scaffold, a particularly onerous duty, as it required many days, even months sometimes, to overcome the trauma of witnessing these men's deaths.[10]  However, in one case, he succeeded in gaining freedom for a man who had been accused as an accomplice to murder by convincing the murderer to declare just before his execution that he had no accomplices.[12]/nThe Observatory at Creighton was eventually headed by Joseph's youngest brother William Rigge from 1895 until his own death in 1927.  Although dilapidated and in disrepair it is still standing on the campus of Creighton to this day./nWithin a year after leaving Creighton, during which he taught physics and chemistry at St. Xavier College, Rigge volunteered in 1896 to go to St. John's College, Belize, where he spent two years teaching English grammar. His health forced him to come home for a time, teaching again at Marquette while he convalesced, but he requested permission to return,[13] and spent the years from 1900 to 1905[1] at mission stations throughout British Honduras, with Corozal Town as his base. He also served as pastor of Sacred Heart Church, Dangriga for a time. Conditions in many of the ranchos he visited were still primitive at this time, and many of the natives still spoke tribal languages, such as Mayan and Garifuna, making the task of teaching the catechism challenging, but Rigge persevered despite his age.[14]/nIn 1906 Rigge's health once more forced him to return to his hometown of Cincinnati, where he taught in the science department at St. Xavier College. In 1907, he was assigned as pastor of St. Francis Xavier Church in Cincinnati, where he remained until his death in 1913.[1]  Here he was said to have devoted himself to the poor, spending much of his night in sick calls, yet being one of the first to rise in the morning to be ready for confessions, though his was the late Mass.[10]/nIn late March 1913, a series of winter storms caused the Great Dayton Flood, and despite his 71 years, Rigge made his way to Dayton as the water was reaching its highest levels, to help those suffering its effects.  As a result of his exertions, he succumbed to exhaustion and died two weeks later in Cincinnati, on April 17, 1913.

Unlike the previous NTUC secretary-general Lim Chee Onn, Lee Kuan Yew's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Ong Teng Cheong in 1983 had an \"implicit pact\" with the trade unions\u2014involving grassroots leaders in top decisions and \"working actively and forcefully\" in the interests of the unions \"in a way Lim had never seen to do\"\u2014in exchange for the unions' continued \"cooperation on the government's core industrial relations strategies\". (In 1969, the NTUC had adopted \"a cooperative, rather than a confrontational policy towards employers\".)[20]/nAlthough striking was prohibited and trade unions were barred from negotiating such matters as promotion, transfer, employment, dismissal, retrenchment, and reinstatement, issues that \"accounted for most earlier labour disputes\", the government provided measures for workers' safety and welfare, and serious union disputes with employers were almost always handled through the Industrial Arbitration Court, which had powers of both binding arbitration and voluntary mediation.[21] However, Ong felt these measures did not prevent \"management [from] taking advantage of the workers\", recalling in a 2000 interview in Asiaweek: \"Some of them were angry with me about that... the minister for trade and industry [Tan] was very angry, his officers were upset. They had calls from America, asking what happened to Singapore?\"[22] However the fact that the strike only lasted two days before \"all the issues were settled\" was cited by Ong in a 2000 interview with Asiaweek as proof that \"management was just trying to pull a fast one\"./nTan initially opposed the timing of building the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) in 1981 when it was raised by Ong. Tan held the view that the local construction industry was overheated at the time, and public housing should take priority.[23]/nAfter Ong Teng Cheong and Lee Hsien Loong were diagnosed with cancer in 1992 and 1993 respectively,[24][25] Tan was asked to return to Cabinet in August 1995 as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence.[26] It was reported that he declined an offer of make-up pay, which compensate ministers for a loss in salary when they leave the private sector.[27] Tan declared that \"the interests of Singapore must take precedence over that of a bank and my own personal considerations\".[28]/nIn August 2003, he relinquished the portfolio of Minister for Defence and became Coordinating Minister for Security and Defence, while retaining the portfolio of Deputy Prime Minister.[3] He later persuaded Minister for National Development Mah Bow Tan to abandon plans to demolish an old mosque in his constituency of Sembawang.[29] Dubbed the \"Last Kampung Mosque in Singapore\", it was later designated a heritage site.[30]/nTan joined other dissenting colleagues in opposing the implementation of Integrated Resorts (IRs) with their attached casinos to Singapore. Commenting on a survey of gambling habits conducted by the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports, Tan had said he was \"appalled\" that a newspaper headline dismissed the number of likely problem gamblers\u201455,000 as insignificant: \"I don't think it's insignificant. Every Singaporean is important. Every Singaporean that gets into trouble means one family that is destroyed. It cannot be a matter of small concern to the Government.\"[31][32]/nPrime Minister Lee Kuan Yew picked Tan to succeed him as Prime Minister, but Tan declined.[33] Prime Minister Lee once praised Tan for his quick mind and decisiveness. \"He would say 'yes or no' and he would stick to it,\" said Prime Minister Lee.[33]/nAs Deputy Prime Minister, Tan was instrumental in the establishment of the Singapore Management University (SMU) and shaped its direction and early history. In 1997, the Singapore Government raised the idea of a third university for Singapore.[34]/nTan believed that the new university should differentiate itself from the two established institutions\u2014the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), as the government wanted SMU to be an experiment in diversity.[34] Tan believed that the third university should follow the American example which concentrated on management, business and economics.[35]/nHe made trips to universities in the United States to know more about them and search for potential partnerships.[36] He helped to make the third university happen, reaching out to veteran businessman and current Chairman of the SMU Board of Trustees Ho Kwon Ping to help in its establishment.[35]/nTan, having begun to look after the university education in the 1990s, was the driving force behind SMU, which in 2000 was set up as the country's first publicly-funded autonomous university.[36]/nTan stepped down as Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for Security and Defence on 1 September 2005.[8]/nOn 22 December 2010, Tan announced that he would step down from his government-linked positions at GIC and SPH to run for the office of President of Singapore.[37] Tan's campaign stressed his independence and his divergent views from the PAP government in specific policies, citing a remark made by MP Tan Soo Khoon in 2005: \"It is probably the first time that I have heard Cabinet ministers, starting with no less than the deputy prime minister, Dr. Tony Tan, expressing divergent views [on the Integrated Resorts question].\"[38][39] However, competing presidential candidates and former PAP members Tan Kin Lian and Tan Cheng Bock questioned Tan's independence from the party.[40] On 7 July 2011, Tony Tan submitted his presidential eligibility forms.[41] In July 2011, Tony Tan stepped down from his positions at GIC and SPH to contest in the presidential election.[10] Tan subsequently won 35.20% of the vote.[42]/nOn 29 July 2011, Tan responded to online allegations[43] that his son Patrick Tan had received preferential treatment during his National Service (NS). \"My sons all completed their National Service obligations fully and I have never intervened in their postings,\" he said.[44][45] Tan also noted that he had served as Minister for Defence from 1995 to 2003, while Patrick Tan said that it was in 1988 that he been permitted by the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) to disrupt his NS for premedical studies in Harvard University,[46] where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in biology and chemistry, and an MD-PhD program at Stanford University under the President's Scholarship and Loke Cheng Kim Scholarship.[47] MINDEF clarified that, prior to 1992, disruptions were allowed for overseas medical studies, and longer periods of disruption were granted for those admitted to universities in the United States, where medicine is a graduate course. American medical students are required to complete a \"pre-medical component for a general undergraduate degree\" before applying to medical school.[48] In response to a question in Parliament on the subject of deferments, Minister for Defence Ng Eng Hen stated on 20 October 2011 that Patrick Tan had not been given any special treatment.[49]/nDescribing himself as \"Tested, Trusted, True\", Tan said his past experiences will help him steer Singapore through the financial uncertainty lying ahead.[50]/nDuring the Nomination Day on 17 August 2011, Tan unveiled his election symbol\u2014a pair of black glasses which resembles the trademark spectacles he has steadfastly worn for years. His campaign materials, which included caps, postcards and fridge magnets also carried the symbol. About 9,400 posters and 200 banners were printed.[51]/nTan's presidential bid was endorsed by the 10,000-strong Federation of Tan Clan Associations on 7 August 2011.[52] By 13 August 2011, the leaders of 19 NTUC-affiliated unions\u2014which have 128,000 members, had endorsed his bid.[53][54] On 14 August, the leadership of the Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations (SFCCA) and the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry (SCCCI) also endorsed his bid.[55][56] The leadership of another four unions from the construction and real estate sector, which represent more than 50,000 members, endorsed Tan's bid on 16 August. Nine Teochew clan associations also supported Tan.[57] Union leaders in three sectors\u2014Transport and Logistics, Marine and Machinery-engineering, and Infocomm and Media\u2014endorsed Tan on 17 August. They together represent 112,000 workers.[58]/nThe Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SMCCI) endorsed Tan's presidential candidacy on 18 August 2011. It is also was the first Malay organisation to do so.[59]/nAfter a closed door meeting with the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry on 11 August 2011, Tan remarked that it is \"not too early\" for the government to have contingency plans in case an economic crisis hits Singapore, noting that \"with his background and knowledge\", he added that he was in a position to provide \"a steady hand\".[60]/nSpeaking to reporters after a dialogue with the Singapore Manufacturers' Federation the following day, Tan remarked that it would be a \"grave mistake\" to phase out manufacturing in Singapore, which has been transitioning to a service economy and an information economy since the 1980s. He then went on to describe manufacturing as a \"key pillar of Singapore's economy\". Without the sector, he feels Singapore's economy will be \"less resilient, less diversified\" and there will be \"fewer options for our young people and Singapore will lose.\"[61]/nOn 15 August 2011, following the National Day Rally speech by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Tan said that one point he found particularly interesting in Lee's address was whether Singapore would remain pragmatic in its policy making, or if it would turn populist. He added that the temptation to make populist decisions was affecting the presidential election, \"with some candidates appealing to the public in ways that could go beyond the parameters of the Singapore's Constitution\".[62][63]/nOn 17 August 2011, crowds booed[64] at Tan and his son as he delivered his two-minute Nomination Day speech. According to The Straits Times, the jeers came from a vocal group of people who mostly supported another presidential candidate Tan Jee Say.[65] At a press conference later that day, Tony Tan said that while different points of view were to be expected in a campaign, it was disappointing to have people who would not even listen, and hoped that Singaporeans would listen to the views of all the candidates. He said, \"I don't think that jeering or heckling is the right way to go about the campaign, particularly in a campaign for the president, which has to be conducted with decorum and dignity.\"[66]/nDuring the first presidential candidate broadcast on 18 August 2011, while other candidates made promises in their first presidential candidate broadcasts on Thursday night, Tan refrained[67] from making promises during the broadcast and focused on the role of the president instead. Speaking in English, Chinese and Malay, Tan said,[68] \"Some people argue that the president must take a public stand on current issues. I hear and share the concerns of Singaporeans. But policies are debated in Parliament and implemented by the government. Others have said that the president must oppose the government. That is a job for the opposition. People interested in such roles should run for Parliament in the next general election.\"/nTan sought to distinguish his presidency by promoting a more active civil society, believing that Singapore needed to build up its \"social reserves\" to complement the substantial financial reserves the city state had accumulated over time.[69] An example of this, he said, was the way that he had expanded Singapore's President's Challenge charity event to go beyond fund-raising to promote volunteerism and social entrepreneurship.[70]/nOn 8 November 2016, Tan announced that he would not be standing in 2017 presidential election, which was reserved for Malay candidates after a constitutional amendment on 9 November 2016.[71][72] Tan left office on 31 August 2017.[73] He was succeeded by Halimah Yacob who became president after a walkover of the presidential elections, as no other candidates were deemed eligible.[74]/nFrom 1980 to 1981, Tan served as Vice-Chancellor of the National University of Singapore.[3][75] Tan was subsequently ex officio appointed Chancellor of the National University of Singapore and the Nanyang Technological University when he was elected as the president of Singapore in 2017./nTan had served as patron of many organisations, including the Singapore Dance Theatre,[76] Singapore Computer Society,[77] SJI International,[78] Duke\u2013NUS Medical School,[79] and the MIT Club of Singapore.[80] He was also named as the first patron of Dover Park Hospice in May 2011.[81]/nOn 21 November 2017, GIC, the country's sovereign wealth fund, announced that Tan will be appointed Director and Special Advisor from 1 January 2018.[82]/nTan's paternal grandfather was Tan Cheng Siong, the former general manager of the Overseas Chinese Bank, one of three precursor banks to OCBC Bank.[83] His uncle was former Chairman of OCBC Bank, Tan Chin Tuan.[84] Through his maternal grandmother Annie Tan Sun Neo, he is also a great-great-great grandson of philanthropist Tan Kim Seng.[85]/nWhen Tan was a first year physics student in 1959 at the University of Malaya\u2014the predecessor of the National University of Singapore\u2014at Bukit Timah campus, he met an arts undergraduate whom he fell in love and would marry five years later.[75] Tan married Mary Chee Bee Kiang in 1964 and they have children together.[citation needed]/nIn 2005, Tan was presented the NUS Eminent Alumni Award in recognition of his role as a visionary architect of Singapore's university sector.[3]/nIn 2010, he was presented the inaugural Distinguished Australian Alumnus Award by the Australian Alumni Singapore (AAS) at its 55th anniversary dinner in recognition of his distinguished career, and his significant contribution to society and to the Australian alumni community.[86][87]/nTan was awarded a medal from the Foreign Policy Association in 2011 for \"outstanding leadership and service\".[88]/nIn 2014, Tan was conferred an honorary doctorate by his alma mater, the University of Adelaide, for his \"long record of outstanding achievements both as a leader in the Singapore government and in the business sectors.[89] He was also made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath.[90]/nIn 2018, Tan received the top honour of the Order of Temasek (First Class) during Singapore's National Day Awards.[91]", "1463636": "Christos Dimitriou Papakyriakopoulos (Greek: \u03a7\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2; June 29, 1914 \u2013 June 29, 1976), commonly known as Papa, was a Greek mathematician specializing in geometric topology./nPapakyriakopoulos was born in Chalandri, then in the Municipality of Athens, now in North Athens./nPapakyriakopoulos worked in isolation at Athens Polytechnic as research assistant to Professor Nikolaos Kritikos. But he was enrolled as research student at Athens University, being awarded a PhD in 1943 on the recommendation of Constantin Carath\u00e9odory.

In honor of this work, he was awarded the first Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry in 1964. From the early 1960s on, he mostly worked on the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture.

This work led to a 2013 Ostrowski Prize, a 2014 Cole Prize, a 2014 Rolf Schock Prize, and a 2014 MacArthur Fellowship. Zhang became a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Santa Barbara in fall 2015.[5][6][7][8]/nZhang was born in Shanghai, China, with his ancestral home in Pinghu, Zhejiang. He lived in Shanghai with his grandmother until he went to Peking University. At around the age of nine, he found a proof of the Pythagorean theorem.[9] He first learned about Fermat's Last Theorem and the Goldbach conjecture when he was 10.[9] During the Cultural Revolution, he and his mother were sent to the countryside to work in the fields. He worked as a laborer for 10 years and was unable to attend high school.[9] After the Cultural Revolution ended, Zhang entered Peking University in 1978 as an undergraduate student and received a Bachelor of Science in mathematics in 1982. He became a graduate student of Professor Pan Chengbiao, a number theorist at Peking University, and obtained a Master of Science in mathematics in 1984.[10]/nAfter receiving his master's degree in mathematics, with recommendations from Professor Ding Shisun, the President of Peking University, and Professor Deng Donggao, chair of the university's Math Department,[11] Zhang was granted a full scholarship at Purdue University. Zhang arrived at Purdue in January 1985, studied there for six and a half years, and obtained his PhD in mathematics in December 1991./nZhang's PhD work was on the Jacobian conjecture. After graduation, Zhang had trouble finding an academic position. In a 2013 interview with Nautilus magazine, Zhang said he did not get a job after graduation. \"During that period it was difficult to find a job in academics. That was a job market problem. Also, my advisor [Tzuong-Tsieng Moh] did not write me letters of recommendation.\"[12] Zhang made this claim again in George Csicsery's documentary film \"Counting from Infinity: Yitang Zhang and the Twin Prime Conjecture\"[13] while discussing his difficulties at Purdue and in the years that followed.[9] Moh claimed that Zhang never came back to him requesting recommendation letters.[11] In a detailed profile published in The New Yorker magazine in February 2015, Alec Wilkinson wrote Zhang \"parted unhappily\" with Moh, and that Zhang \"left Purdue without Moh's support, and, having published no papers, was unable to find an academic job\".[7] In 2018, responding to reports of his treatment of Zhang, Moh posted an update on his website. Moh wrote that Zhang \"failed miserably\" in proving the Jacobian conjecture, \"never published any paper on algebraic geometry\" after leaving Purdue, and \"wasted seven years of his own life and my time\".[14]/nAfter some years, Zhang managed to find a position as a lecturer at the University of New Hampshire, where he was hired by Kenneth Appel in 1999. Prior to getting back to academia, he worked for several years as an accountant and a delivery worker for a New York City restaurant. He also worked in a motel in Kentucky and in a Subway sandwich shop.[2] A profile published in the Quanta Magazine reports that Zhang used to live in his car during the initial job-hunting days.[9] He served as lecturer at UNH from 1999[15] until around January 2014, when UNH appointed him to a full professorship as a result of his breakthrough on prime numbers.[16] Zhang stayed for a semester at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ, in 2014, and he joined the University of California, Santa Barbara in fall 2015.[17]/nOn April 17, 2013, Zhang announced a proof that there are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers that differ by less than 70 million. This result implies the existence of an infinitely repeatable prime 2-tuple,[2] thus establishing a theorem akin to the twin prime conjecture. Zhang's paper was accepted by Annals of Mathematics in early May 2013,[6] his first publication since his last paper in 2001.[18] The proof was refereed by leading experts in analytic number theory.[7] Zhang's result set off a flurry of activity in the field, such as the Polymath8 project./nIf P(N) stands for the proposition that there is an infinitude of pairs of prime numbers (not necessarily consecutive primes) that differ by exactly N, then Zhang's result is equivalent to the statement that there exists at least one even integer k < 70,000,000 such that P(k) is true. The classical form of the twin prime conjecture is equivalent to P(2); and in fact it has been conjectured that P(k) holds for all even integers k.[19][20] While these stronger conjectures remain unproven, a result due to James Maynard in November 2013, employing a different technique, showed that P(k) holds for some k \u2264 600.[21] Subsequently, in April 2014, the Polymath project 8 lowered the bound to k \u2264 246.[22] If the Elliott\u2013Halberstam conjecture and its generalization, respectively, hold, then k \u2264 12 and k \u2264 6 follow using current methods.[7][22]/nZhang was awarded the 2013 Morningside Special Achievement Award in Mathematics,[23] the 2013 Ostrowski Prize,[24] the 2014 Frank Nelson Cole Prize in Number Theory,[16][25] and the 2014 Rolf Schock Prize[26] in Mathematics./nHe is a recipient of the 2014 MacArthur award,[27] and was elected as an Academia Sinica Fellow during the same year.[10] He was an invited speaker at the 2014 International Congress of Mathematicians./nIn 1989 Zhang joined a group interested in Chinese democracy (\u4e2d\u56fd\u6c11\u8054).

To fulfill his goal, Peixoto enrolled in engineering at the School of Engineering of the current Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).[2]/nWhile still working at the School of Engineering around 1955, Peixoto came into contact with the work of De Baggis, a student of Solomon Lefschetz. Through this work, he learnt about the problem of structural stability of dynamical systems.[3]  After some correspondence with Solomon Lefschetz regarding this problem, Peixoto was invited and went to Princeton University in 1957 to work as Lefschetz's student on the topic of structural stability of differential equations.[2] Despite of the great age difference (Peixoto was 36 years old and Lefschetz was 73 years old), Peixoto and Lefschetz became good friends.[4]/nOnce, while talking with Lefschetz, Peixoto commented that no one cared about structural stability of dynamical systems and that was the main problem in working with it. But to Peixoto's surprise Lefschetz's answer was no less than \"No Mauricio, this is no trouble, this is your luck. Try to work as hard and as fast as you can on this subject because the day will come when you will not understand a single word of what they will be saying about structural stability; this happened to me in topology.\"[4]/nWith Lefschetz incentive, Peixoto wrote his first paper on structural stability, that would be later published on the Annals of Mathematics, of which Lefschetz was editor. In 1958, they went to the International Mathematical Congress, in Edinburgh, Scotland, where Lefschetz introduced Peixoto to the Russian mathematician Lev Pontryagin, whose work on dynamical systems was used by Peixoto as a basis for his studies. Pontryagin, though, showed no interest whatsoever in Peixoto's work.[4]/nBack to Princeton, Peixoto met Steve Smale, the mathematician that would later become a reference in dynamical systems. Smale was interested in Peixoto's work and realized he could extend his own based on it. Their contact intensified and, when Peixoto came back to Brazil, the American mathematician spent six months at the Instituto Nacional de Matem\u00e1tica Pura e Aplicada (Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics or IMPA) at Rio de Janeiro.

He is a major figure in the history of mathematical logic, by virtue of summarizing and extending the work of George Boole, Augustus De Morgan, Hugh MacColl, and especially Charles Peirce. He is best known for his monumental Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der Logik (Lectures on the Algebra of Logic, 1890\u20131905), in three volumes, which prepared the way for the emergence of mathematical logic as a separate discipline in the twentieth century by systematizing the various systems of formal logic of the day./nSchr\u00f6der learned mathematics at Heidelberg, K\u00f6nigsberg, and Z\u00fcrich, under Otto Hesse, Gustav Kirchhoff, and Franz Neumann. After teaching school for a few years, he moved to the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt in 1874. Two years later, he took up a chair in mathematics at the Karlsruhe Polytechnische Schule, where he spent the remainder of his life. He never married./nSchr\u00f6der's early work on formal algebra and logic was written in ignorance of the British logicians George Boole and Augustus De Morgan. Instead, his sources were texts by Ohm, Hankel, Hermann Grassmann, and Robert Grassmann (Peckhaus 1997: 233\u2013296). In 1873, Schr\u00f6der learned of Boole's and De Morgan's work on logic. To their work he subsequently added several important concepts due to Charles Sanders Peirce, including subsumption and quantification./nSchr\u00f6der also made original contributions to algebra, set theory, lattice theory,[1] ordered sets and ordinal numbers. Along with Georg Cantor, he codiscovered the Cantor\u2013Bernstein\u2013Schr\u00f6der theorem, although  Schr\u00f6der's proof (1898) is flawed. Felix Bernstein (1878\u20131956) subsequently corrected the proof as part of his Ph.D. dissertation./nSchr\u00f6der (1877) was a concise exposition of Boole's ideas on algebra and logic, which did much to introduce Boole's work to continental readers. The influence of the Grassmanns, especially Robert's little-known Formenlehre, is clear. Unlike Boole, Schr\u00f6der fully appreciated duality. John Venn and Christine Ladd-Franklin both warmly cited this short book of Schr\u00f6der's, and Charles Sanders Peirce used it as a text while teaching at Johns Hopkins University./nSchr\u00f6der's masterwork, his Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der Logik, was published in three volumes between 1890 and 1905, at the author's expense. Vol. 2 is in two parts, the second published posthumously, edited by Eugen M\u00fcller. The Vorlesungen was a comprehensive and scholarly survey of algebraic logic up to the end of the 19th century, one that had a considerable influence on the emergence of mathematical logic in the 20th century. He developed Boole's algebra into a calculus of relations, based on composition of relations as a multiplication. The Schr\u00f6der rules relate alternative interpretations of a product of relations./nThe Vorlesungen is a prolix affair, only a small part of which has been translated into English. That part, along with an extended discussion of the entire Vorlesungen, is in Brady (2000). Also see Grattan-Guinness (2000: 159\u201376)./nSchr\u00f6der said his aim was:/n...to design logic as a calculating discipline, especially to give access to the exact handling of relative concepts, and, from then on, by emancipation from the routine claims of natural language, to withdraw any fertile soil from \"clich\u00e9\" in the field of philosophy as well. This should prepare the ground for a scientific universal language that looks more like a sign language than like a sound language./nSchr\u00f6der's influence on the early development of the predicate calculus, mainly by popularising C.\u00a0S. Peirce's work on quantification, is at least as great as that of Frege or Peano. For an example of  the influence of Schr\u00f6der's work on English-speaking logicians of the early 20th century, see Clarence Irving Lewis (1918). The relational concepts that pervade Principia Mathematica are very much owed to the Vorlesungen, cited in Principia's Preface and in Bertrand Russell's Principles of Mathematics./nFrege (1960) dismissed Schr\u00f6der's work, and admiration  for Frege's pioneering role has dominated subsequent historical discussion. Contrasting Frege with Schr\u00f6der and C.\u00a0S. Peirce, however, Hilary Putnam (1982) writes:/nWhen I started to trace the later development of logic, the first thing I did was to look at Schr\u00f6der's Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der Logik, ...[whose] third volume is on the logic of relations (Algebra und Logik der Relative, 1895). The three volumes immediately became the best-known advanced logic text, and embody what any mathematician interested in the study of logic should have known, or at least have been acquainted with, in the 1890s./nWhile, to my knowledge, no one except Frege ever published a single paper in Frege's notation, many famous logicians adopted Peirce-Schr\u00f6der notation, and famous results and systems were published in it. L\u00f6wenheim stated and proved the L\u00f6wenheim theorem (later reproved and strengthened by Thoralf Skolem, whose name became attached to it together with L\u00f6wenheim's) in Peircian notation. In fact, there is no reference in L\u00f6wenheim's paper to any logic other than Peirce's. To cite another example, Zermelo presented his axioms for set theory in Peirce-Schr\u00f6der notation, and not, as one might have expected, in Russell-Whitehead notation./nOne can sum up these simple facts (which anyone can quickly verify) as follows: Frege certainly discovered the quantifier first (four years before Oscar Howard Mitchell, going by publication dates, which are all we have as far as I know). But Leif Ericson probably discovered America \"first\" (forgive me for not counting the native Americans, who of course really discovered it \"first\"). If the effective discoverer, from a European point of view, is Christopher Columbus, that is because he discovered it so that it stayed discovered (by Europeans, that is), so that the discovery became known (by Europeans). Frege did \"discover\" the quantifier in the sense of having the rightful claim to priority; but Peirce and his students discovered it in the effective sense. The fact is that until Russell appreciated what he had done, Frege was relatively obscure, and it was Peirce who seems to have been known to the entire world logical community. How many of the people who think that \"Frege invented logic\" are aware of these facts?", "37312015": "Nathan Altshiller Court (January 22, 1881 \u2013 July 20, 1968) was a Polish\u2013American mathematician.

The purpose of book was to study intricate geometrical relations with algebra and provide solutions to equations.[10]/nMany of the problems are solved by polynomial equations, which are represented using a method called tian yuan shu, \"coefficient array method\" or literally \"method of the celestial unknown\".[1][11] The method was known before him in some form.  It is a positional system of rod numerals to represent polynomial equations./nFor example, 2x2 + 18x \u2212 316 = 0 is represented as/nwhich is equal to  in Arabic Numbers./nThe \u5143 (yuan) denotes the unknown x, so the numerals on that line mean 18x. The line below is the constant term (-316) and the line above is the coefficient of the quadratic (x2) term. The system accommodates arbitrarily high exponents of the unknown by adding more lines on top and negative exponents by adding lines below the constant term. Decimals can also be represented. Later, the line order was reversed so that the first line is the lowest exponent./nLi does not explain how to solve equations in general, but shows it with the example problems. Most of the equations can be reduced to the second or sometimes third order. It is often assumed that he used methods similar to Ruffini's rule and Horner scheme./nYigu yanduan (New steps in computation) is a work of more basic mathematics written soon after Li Ye completed Ceyuan haijing, and was probably written to help students who could not understand Sea mirror of circle measurements. Yigu yanduan consists of three volumes dedicated to solving geometrical problems on two tracks, through Tian yuan shu and geometry. It also contained algebraic problems, but with slightly different notations.[11]/nThe huntian (\u6e3e\u5929) theory of the celestial sphere stipulated that the earth was flat and square, while the heavens were spherical in shape, along with celestial bodies such as the sun and moon (described by 1st-century AD polymathic scientist and statesman Zhang Heng like a crossbow bullet and ball, respectively).[12] However, the idea of a flat earth was criticized by the Jin dynasty astronomer Yu Xi (fl. 307-345 AD), who suggested a rounded shape as an alternative.[13] In his Jingzhai gu zhin zhu (\u656c\u9f4b\u53e4\u4eca\u6ce8),[14] Li Ye echoed Yu's idea that the Earth was spherical, similar in shape to the heavens but smaller in size, arguing that it could not be square since that would hinder the movement of the heavens and celestial bodies.[15]/nHowever, the idea of a spherical earth was not accepted in mainstream Chinese science and cartography until the 17th century during the late Ming and early Qing periods, with the advent of evidence of European circumnavigation of the globe.[16] The flat Earth theory in Chinese science was finally overturned in the 17th-century. Jesuits in China also introduced the spherical Earth model advanced by ancient Greeks such as Philolaus and Eratosthenes[17] and presented in world maps such as Matteo Ricci's Kunyu Wanguo Quantu published in Ming-dynasty China in 1602.[18]", "51107351": "Professor Patrick Joseph Nolan (11 August 1894 \u2013 28 December 1984) was an Irish physicist.

In 1900 he passed part II of the Tripos, and in the same year he was elected to a Prize Fellowship at Trinity College.[1]:\u200a448\u200a In 1903 he earned his M.A., which was the highest academic degree at English universities at that time. When his Prize Fellowship expired in 1906 he was appointed to the Trinity staff as a lecturer in mathematics, where teaching six hours per week left him time for research.[1]:\u200a448\u200a In 1919 he left Cambridge to take the Savilian Chair of Geometry (and thus become a Fellow of New College[13]) at Oxford in the aftermath of the Bertrand Russell affair during World War I. Hardy spent the academic year 1928\u20131929 at Princeton University in an academic exchange with Oswald Veblen, who spent the year at Oxford.[3] Hardy gave the Josiah Willard Gibbs lecture for 1928.[14][15] Hardy left Oxford and returned to Cambridge in 1931, becoming again a fellow of Trinity College and holding the Sadleirian Professorship until 1942.[1]:\u200a453/nHe was on the governing body of Abingdon School from 1922 to 1935.[16]/nHardy is credited with reforming British mathematics by bringing rigour into it, which was previously a characteristic of French, Swiss and German mathematics.[17] British mathematicians had remained largely in the tradition of applied mathematics, in thrall to the reputation of Isaac Newton (see Cambridge Mathematical Tripos). Hardy was more in tune with the cours d'analyse methods dominant in France, and aggressively promoted his conception of pure mathematics, in particular against the hydrodynamics that was an important part of Cambridge mathematics.[citation needed]/nFrom 1911, he collaborated with John Edensor Littlewood, in extensive work in mathematical analysis and analytic number theory. This (along with much else) led to quantitative progress on Waring's problem, as part of the Hardy\u2013Littlewood circle method, as it became known. In prime number theory, they proved results and some notable conditional results. This was a major factor in the development of number theory as a system of conjectures; examples are the first and second Hardy\u2013Littlewood conjectures. Hardy's collaboration with Littlewood is among the most successful and famous collaborations in mathematical history. In a 1947 lecture, the Danish mathematician Harald Bohr reported a colleague as saying, \"Nowadays, there are only three really great English mathematicians: Hardy, Littlewood, and Hardy\u2013Littlewood.\"[18]:\u200axxvii/nHardy is also known for formulating the Hardy\u2013Weinberg principle, a basic principle of population genetics, independently from Wilhelm Weinberg in 1908. He played cricket with the geneticist Reginald Punnett, who introduced the problem to him in purely mathematical terms.[19]:\u200a9\u200a Hardy, who had no interest in genetics and described the mathematical argument as \"very simple\", may never have realised how important the result became.[20]:\u200a117/nHardy was elected an international honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1921,[21] an international member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1927,[22] and an international member of the American Philosophical Society in 1939.[23]/nHardy's collected papers have been published in seven volumes by Oxford University Press.[24]/nHardy preferred his work to be considered pure mathematics, perhaps because of his detestation of war and the military uses to which mathematics had been applied. He made several statements similar to that in his Apology:/nI have never done anything \"useful\". No discovery of mine has made, or is likely to make, directly or indirectly, for good or ill, the least difference to the amenity of the world.[25]/nHowever, aside from formulating the Hardy\u2013Weinberg principle in population genetics, his famous work on integer partitions with his collaborator Ramanujan, known as the Hardy\u2013Ramanujan asymptotic formula, has been widely applied in physics to find quantum partition functions of atomic nuclei (first used by Niels Bohr) and to derive thermodynamic functions of non-interacting Bose\u2013Einstein systems. Though Hardy wanted his maths to be \"pure\" and devoid of any application, much of his work has found applications in other branches of science.[26]/nMoreover, Hardy deliberately pointed out in his Apology that mathematicians generally do not \"glory in the uselessness of their work,\" but rather \u2013 because science can be used for evil ends as well as good \u2013 \"mathematicians may be justified in rejoicing that there is one science at any rate, and that their own, whose very remoteness from ordinary human activities should keep it gentle and clean.\"[27]:\u200a33\u200a Hardy also rejected as a \"delusion\" the belief that the difference between pure and applied mathematics had anything to do with their utility. Hardy regards as \"pure\" the kinds of mathematics that are independent of the physical world, but also considers some \"applied\" mathematicians, such as the physicists Maxwell and Einstein, to be among the \"real\" mathematicians, whose work \"has permanent aesthetic value\" and \"is eternal because the best of it may, like the best literature, continue to cause intense emotional satisfaction to thousands of people after thousands of years.\" Although he admitted that what he called \"real\" mathematics may someday become useful, he asserted that, at the time in which the Apology was written, only the \"dull and elementary parts\" of either pure or applied mathematics could \"work for good or ill.\"[27]:\u200a39/nSocially, Hardy was associated with the Bloomsbury group and the Cambridge Apostles; G. E. Moore, Bertrand Russell and J. M. Keynes were friends. He was an avid cricket fan. Maynard Keynes observed that if Hardy had read the stock exchange for half an hour every day with as much interest and attention as he did the day's cricket scores, he would have become a rich man.[28]/nHe was at times politically involved, if not an activist. He took part in the Union of Democratic Control during World War I, and For Intellectual Liberty in the late 1930s.[17]/nApart from close friendships, he had a few platonic relationships with young men who shared his sensibilities, and often his love of cricket.[28] A mutual interest in cricket led him to befriend the young C. P. Snow.[29]:\u200a10\u201312\u200a[30] Hardy was a lifelong bachelor and in his final years he was cared for by his sister./nHardy was extremely shy as a child, and was socially awkward, cold and eccentric throughout his life. During his school years he was top of his class in most subjects, and won many prizes and awards but hated having to receive them in front of the entire school. He was uncomfortable being introduced to new people, and could not bear to look at his own reflection in a mirror. It is said that, when staying in hotels, he would cover all the mirrors with towels.[29]/nPaul Hoffman writes that \"His concerns were wide-ranging, as evidenced by six New Year's resolutions he set in a postcard to a friend: \"(1) prove the Riemann hypothesis; (2) make 211 not out in the fourth innings of the last Test Match at the Oval; (3) find an argument for the nonexistence of God which shall convince the general public; (4) be the first man at the top of Mount Everest; (5) be proclaimed the first president of the U. S. S. R. of Great Britain and Germany; and (6) murder Mussolini.\".[31]/nHardy is a key character, played by Jeremy Irons, in the 2015 film The Man Who Knew Infinity, based on the biography of Ramanujan with the same title.[36] Hardy is a major character in David Leavitt's historical fiction novel The Indian Clerk (2007), which depicts his Cambridge years and his relationship with John Edensor Littlewood and Ramanujan.[37] Hardy is a secondary character in Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture (1992), a mathematics novel by Apostolos Doxiadis.[38] Hardy is also a character in the 2014 Indian film, Ramanujan, played by Kevin McGowan.", "61232693": "Bruce Reznick (born February 3, 1953 in New York City) is an American mathematician long on the faculty at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign.

Condorcet in charge of reforming the French Education was banned then executed and the educational system was wrecking. He was the presenter of a project of reform to a commission of top-level scientists including Vandermonde, Berthollet, Fourcroy, Monge, Lagrange. This project was the start for the creation of several high-schools and institutes.  He had an important role during the period of the Convention\u00a0: in charge with  Monge and Lagrange to select the mathematics teachers for the newly created high-schools (\"Grandes Ecoles\"), in charge to evaluate \"war weapons\"  and to conduct experiments on \"projectiles shapes\". In 1794, he attended a \"representative of the nation\" in a survey of \"coal mines and weapons manufactures\".

In 1804, Napoleon imposes a military status to the school and the  new governor, general Lacu\u00e9e, determined to eliminate any trouble-maker, dismissed him in October 1804.

In 1925 he was awarded an Open Scholarship to the University of Cambridge and the Royal Scholarship in Physics at Imperial College of Science and Technology, but he chose to read mathematics at Imperial College.[3] His courses included Pure and Applied Mathematics, Physics, Hydrodynamics and the Kinetic Theory of Gases.[3] He was awarded a BSc degree with first-class honours in mathematics in 1929 and became an associate of the Royal College of Science.[3] He remained at Imperial College for another two years and was awarded the Diploma of Imperial College (D.I.C.) in 1930./nIn 1930 Womersely left Imperial College to take up a position as a junior research officer at the Shirley Institute (British Cotton Industry Research Institute), Manchester.[3] There he applied mathematical techniques to problems in textile manufacture, including research on cotton spinning, drafting fibrous materials, and, through L. H. C. Tippett,[4] the use of mathematical statistics in industrial production and quality control.[2][3] While at the Shirley Institute he also met Leslie Comrie and became interested in computational techniques.[3]  As a result, he spent a month at HM Nautical Almanac Office, London learning Comrie's numerical approaches.[3] In 1936 he collaborated with Douglas Hartree who had built a Differential Analyser at the University of Manchester; together they devised a much cited method for the numerical integration of partial differential equations.[3] In 1937, with war looming, he joined the armaments research department at Woolwich as a scientific officer, and worked on using statistical techniques applied to ballistics and ammunition proofing.  In 1942, after the outbreak of World War II, he was appointed assistant director of scientific research at the Ministry of Supply and asked to set up and head the Advisory Service on Statistical Methods (later known as SR17).[5] This organization was responsible for advice and research into ammunition supply, engineering factories and the investigations of a range of Government Inspectorates. It was particularly important in ensuring quality control and promoting sample inspection methods to British industry during wartime. In 1944 he joined the British Association mathematical tables committee and in the same year he was appointed as the first superintendent of the Mathematics Division of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL).[6] In addition to being responsible for statistical quality control, NPL was tasked with building an electronic computer, for which Womersley coined the name Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), echoing Babbage's Analytical Engine.  Womersely was therefore responsible for the set up and operation of the first national computing centre in UK. One of his first actions was to visit the US for a fact-finding tour, where he learned about ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), Howard Aitken's Harvard machine, George Stibitz's machines and von Neumann's plans for the binary computer, EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer). On his return, he recruited Alan Turing to work on the ACE section and backed him strongly.[3][7] Womersley also recruited Donald Davies in 1947.[8] However, progress on the ACE project was delayed and Turing developed a dislike of Womersley and disdain for his abilities[9] and left the project in 1948. Davies then took over from Turing and a small experimental model, pilot ACE was produced in 1950.[10] Whether Womersely led NPL successfully has been questioned,[11] although the consensus seems to be that he did a good job in difficult circumstances.[3][12][13] He himself left the project in 1950, before the prototype pilot ACE was completed, to join the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM), a forerunner of International Computers Limited (ICL). There he recognised that the computers previously developed by academia or governments were too large and expensive to be commercially viable and he recruited Andrew Booth who had developed the All Purpose Electronic Computer at Birbeck University, as a consultant to develop a smaller inexpensive computer.[14] The computer copied from Booth's original design by Ray Bird was named the Hollerith Electronic Computer (HEC1), and was Britain's first mass-produced business computer.[15]/nIn 1954 Womersley left BTM and joined a research team, led by Donald McDonald at St Bartholomew's Hospital, who were studying blood flow in arteries. This change seems to have been a temporary arrangement to 'fill in time whilst awaiting completion of arrangements to come to WADC' (the Wright Air Development Center, Dayton, Ohio, USA).[3] His collaboration with McDonald may have been prompted by his eldest daughter, Barbara, who was studying medicine at St Bartholomew's.[16] Whatever the reason, this move led to a new and highly productive period in his research, as he applied mathematical and computational techniques to the analysis of blood flow and hemodynamics. Most notably in 1955 he published an article[17] which described a dimensionless parameter (\u03b1) which characterised the nature of unsteady flow;[18][19] subsequently this has been called the Womersley number.[18] In July 1955, as planned, he moved to WADC  to take a post as acting chief of the Analysis Section, System Dynamics Branch Aeronautical Research Laboratory. In 1956, he was promoted to Supervisory Mathematician and then Supervisory Aeronautical Research Engineer (Flight Systems), although he continued to publish on mathematical aspects of blood flow until his early death in 1958.[3] His 1957 monograph on 'An elastic tube theory of pulse transmission and oscillatory flow in mammalian arteries' is widely regarded as a major influence in the field.[16] In 1957 he returned to Britain for treatment of cancer. He underwent a number of operations in London and returned to Ohio in 1957, but never fully recovered and died at Ohio State University Hospital, Columbus, on 7 March 1958./nWomersley married Jean Isobel Jordan in Hammersmith, London in 1931.

In 1866, Venn published The Logic of Chance, a groundbreaking book which espoused the frequency theory of probability, arguing that probability should be determined by how often something is forecast to occur as opposed to \"educated\" assumptions.

He found the Mathematical Tripos unsuited to his mathematical style, complaining that the handful of private tutors he worked with \"always had the Tripos prominently in view\". In contrast, Venn wished to investigate interesting ideas beyond the syllabus. Nonetheless, he was Sixth Wrangler upon sitting the exams in January 1857.[9]/nVenn experienced, in his words, a \"reaction and disgust\" to the Tripos which led him to sell his books on mathematics and state that he would never return to the subject.[9] Following his family vocation, he was ordained as an Anglican priest in 1859, serving first at the church in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, and later in Mortlake, Surrey.[10]/nIn 1862, he returned to Cambridge as a lecturer in moral science, studying and teaching political economy, philosophy, probability theory and logic.[5][9] He reacquainted himself with logic and became a leading scholar in the field through his textbooks The Logic of Chance (1866), Symbolic Logic (1881) and The Principles of Empirical or Inductive Logic (1889).

He was a research professor at the Department of Applied Mathematics at Moscow Institute of Electronics and Mathematics of Higher School of Economics.[4]/nMaslov was known as a prominent specialist in the field of mathematical physics, differential equations, functional analysis, mechanics and quantum physics. He developed asymptotic methods that are widely applied to equations arising in quantum mechanics, field theory, statistical physics and abstract mathematics, that bear his name.[5]/nMaslov's asymptotic methods are closely related to such problems as the theory of a self-consistent field in quantum and classical statistics, superfluidity and superconductivity, quantization of solitons, quantum field theory in strong external fields and in curved space-time, the method of expansion in the inverse number of particle types. In 1983, he attended the International Congress of Mathematicians in Warsaw, where he presented a plenary report \"Non-standard characteristics of asymptotic problems\".[6]/nMaslov dealt with the problems of liquid and gas, carried out fundamental research on the problems of magnetohydrodynamics related to the dynamo problem. He also made calculations for the emergency unit of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant during the 1986 disaster. In 1991, he made model and forecasts of the economic situation in Russia.[6]/nFrom the early 1990s, he worked on the use of equations of mathematical physics in economics and financial analysis. In particular, he managed to predict the 1998 Russian financial crisis, and even earlier, the collapse of the economic and, as a consequence, the collapse of the political system of the USSR.[6]/nIn 2008, Maslov in his own words predicted a global recession in the late 2000s. He calculated the critical number of U.S. debt, and found out that a crisis should break out in the near future. In the calculations, he used equations similar to the equations of phase transition in physics. In the mid-1980s, Maslov introduced the term tropical mathematics, in which the operations of the conditional optimization problem were considered.[7]/nIn the early 1970s, he met L\u00ea V\u0169 Anh, the daughter of L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n, then General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, when she was a student at the Faculty of Physics in Moscow State University. The romance was considered scandalous because Vietnamese students studying abroad were not allowed to have romantic relationships with foreigners and anyone caught would have to be disciplined and may be sent back to Vietnam. In order to avoid trouble, she returned home to marry a Vietnamese student from the same university and wanted to stay in Vietnam to forget her love affair with Maslov. However, she was forced by her father to return to USSR to complete her studies.[8]/nWhen she and her husband returned to Moscow, Anh realized that she did not love her husband and could not forget her former lover. She decided to live separately from her husband and secretly went back and forth with Maslov. After being pregnant for the second time, after having a miscarriage for the first time, Anh had enough energy to ask her husband for a divorce in order to be able to marry Maslov. In 1975, she and Maslov married. She gave birth to a daughter on 31 October 1977 named Lena. Meeting her father by chance when he went to USSR for a state visit, Anh confessed all her love affairs. L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n did not accept it and tried to lure her back to the country. However, Anh gradually reconciled with her family.[8]/nAfter giving birth to her second daughter Tania, Anh gave birth to her son, Anton, on 1981. Anh died shortly after giving birth to her son, due to hemorrhage.[9]/nImmediately after Anh died, a dispute over custody of his three children with his wife's family occurred. An official from the Vietnamese Communist Party's Central Committee took over the communication between Maslov and Anh's family. Both sides proposed a compromise solution, Maslov kept his daughters and son would be returned to L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n. Maslov only allowed his son to go to Vietnam for two years. But after the deadline, his son never returned to him. Maslov had to fight for two more years before L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n accepted to bring his grandson to meet his father.[10]/nHowever, the son that Maslov met was no longer Anton Maslov as before, but a Vietnamese citizen with the new name Nguy\u1ec5n An Ho\u00e0n and he was unable to speak Russian. According to Maslov, L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n did not intend to return the child, but also hoped to bring back his daughters. Fearing the loss of his children, Maslov contacted the son of the President of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union Andrei Gromyko, a close friend of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. He was advised to write to Gorbachev and was promised to convince Gorbachev to read it. After a massive legal struggle, L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n gave up the idea of taking him and his children back.[9]/nHis children later resided in England and the Netherlands, where they were highly successful in their respective professions.[9]/nMaslov later re-married a woman named Irina, who was at the same age as his ex-wife Anh. Irina is a linguist and she received the title of Associate Doctor of Science in 1991. For the last three decades, he lived in Troitsk.[9]/nViktor Maslow died on 3 August 2023, at the age of 93.[11]", "71325292": "Martin Harvey Krieger (born March 10, 1944 in Brooklyn, New York) is an American physicist, author, and emeritus professor with decades of teaching in public policy and urban planning.

He published many books, including the first Italian translations of Archimedes and Euclid, and an acclaimed compilation of mathematics. Tartaglia was the first to apply mathematics to the investigation of the paths of cannonballs, known as ballistics, in his Nova Scientia (A New Science, 1537); his work was later partially validated and partially superseded by Galileo's studies on falling bodies. He also published a treatise on retrieving sunken ships./nNiccol\u00f2 was born in Brescia, the son of Michele, a dispatch rider who travelled to neighbouring towns to deliver mail. In 1506, Michele was murdered by robbers, and Niccol\u00f2, his two siblings, and his mother were left impoverished. Niccol\u00f2 experienced further tragedy in 1512 when King Louis XII's troops invaded Brescia during the War of the League of Cambrai against Venice. The militia of Brescia defended their city for seven days. When the French finally broke through, they took their revenge by massacring the inhabitants of Brescia. By the end of battle, over 45,000 residents were killed. During the massacre, Niccol\u00f2 and his family sought sanctuary in the local cathedral. But the French entered and a soldier sliced Niccol\u00f2's jaw and palate with a saber and left him for dead. His mother nursed him back to health but the young boy was left with a speech impediment, prompting the nickname \"Tartaglia\" (\"stammerer\"). After this he would never shave, and grew a beard to camouflage his scars.[2]/nHis surname at birth, if any, is disputed.  Some sources have him as \"Niccol\u00f2 Fontana\", but others claim that the only support for this is a will in which he named a brother, Zuampiero Fontana, as heir, and point out that this does not imply he had the same surname./nTartaglia's biographer Arnoldo Masotti writes that:/nAt the age of about fourteen, he [Tartaglia] went to a Master Francesco to learn to write the alphabet; but by the time he reached \u201ck,\u201d he was no longer able to pay the teacher. \u201cFrom that day,\u201d he later wrote in a moving autobiographical sketch, \u201cI never returned to a tutor, but continued to labour by myself over the works of dead men, accompanied only by the daughter of poverty that is called industry\u201d (Quesiti, bk. VI, question 8).[3]/nTartaglia moved to Verona around 1517, then to Venice in 1534, a major European commercial hub and one of the great centres of the Italian renaissance at this time. Also relevant is Venice's place at the forefront of European printing culture in the sixteenth century, making early printed texts available even to poor scholars if sufficiently motivated or well-connected \u2014 Tartaglia knew of Archimedes' work on the quadrature of the parabola, for example, from Guarico's Latin edition of 1503, which he had found \"in the hands of a sausage-seller in Verona in 1531\" (in mano di un salzizaro in Verona, l'anno 1531 in his words).[4]/nTartaglia eked out a living teaching practical mathematics in abacus schools and earned a penny where he could:/nThis remarkable man [Tartaglia] was a self-educated mathematics teacher who sold mathematical advice to gunners and architects, ten pennies one question, and had to litigate with his customers when they gave him a worn-out cloak for his lectures on Euclid instead of the payment agreed on.[5]/nHe died in Venice./nNova Scientia (1537) was Tartaglia's first published work, described by Matteo Valleriani as:/n... one of the most fundamental works on mechanics of the Renaissance, indeed, the first to transform aspects of practical knowledge accumulated by the early modern artillerists into a theoretical and mathematical framework.[6]/nThen dominant Aristotelian physics preferred categories like \"heavy\" and \"natural\" and \"violent\" to describe motion, generally eschewing mathematical explanations. Tartaglia brought mathematical models to the fore, \"eviscerat[ing] Aristotelian terms of projectile movement\" in the words of Mary J. Henninger-Voss.[7] One of his findings was that the maximum range of a projectile was achieved by directing the cannon at a 45\u00b0 angle to the horizon./nTartaglia's model for a cannonball's flight was that it proceeded from the cannon in a straight line, then after a while started to arc towards the earth along a circular path, then finally dropped in another straight line directly towards the earth.[8] At the end of Book 2 of Nova Scientia, Tartaglia proposes to find the length of that initial rectilinear path for a projectile fired at an elevation of 45\u00b0, engaging in a Euclidean-style argument, but one with numbers attached to line segments and areas, and eventually proceeds algebraically to find the desired quantity (procederemo per algebra in his words).[9]/nMary J. Henninger-Voss notes that \"Tartaglia's work on military science had an enormous circulation throughout Europe\", being a reference for common gunners into the eighteenth century, sometimes through unattributed translations. He influenced Galileo as well, who owned \"richly annotated\" copies of his works on ballistics as he set about solving the projectile problem once and for all.[10]/nArchimedes' works began to be studied outside the universities in Tartaglia's day as exemplary of the notion that mathematics is the key to understanding physics, Federigo Commandino reflecting this notion when saying in 1558 that \"with respect to geometry no one of sound mind could deny that Archimedes was some god\".[11] Tartaglia published a 71-page Latin edition of Archimedes in 1543, Opera Archimedis Syracusani philosophi et mathematici ingeniosissimi, containing Archimedes' works on the parabola, the circle, centres of gravity, and floating bodies. Guarico had published Latin editions of the first two in 1503, but the works on centres of gravity and floating bodies had not been published before. Tartaglia published Italian versions of some Archimedean texts later in life, his executor continuing to publish his translations after his death. Galileo probably learned of Archimedes' work through these widely disseminated editions.[12]/nTartaglia's Italian edition of Euclid in 1543, Euclide Megarense philosopho, was especially significant as the first translation of the Elements into any modern European language. For two centuries Euclid had been taught from two Latin translations taken from an Arabic source; these contained errors in Book V, the Eudoxian theory of proportion, which rendered it unusable. Tartaglia's edition was based on Zamberti's Latin translation of an uncorrupted Greek text, and rendered Book V correctly. He also wrote the first modern and useful commentary on the theory.[13] This work went through many editions in the sixteenth century and helped diffuse knowledge of mathematics to a non-academic but increasingly well-informed literate and numerate public in Italy. The theory became an essential tool for Galileo, as it had been for Archimedes./nTartaglia exemplified and eventually transcended the abaco tradition that had flourished in Italy since the twelfth century, a tradition of concrete commercial mathematics taught at abacus schools maintained by communities of merchants. Maestros d'abaco like Tartaglia taught not with the abacus but with paper-and-pen, inculcating algorithms of the type found in grade schools today./nTartaglia's masterpiece was the General Trattato di Numeri et Misure (General Treatise on Number and Measure),[14] a 1500-page encyclopedia in six parts written in the Venetian dialect, the first three coming out in 1556 about the time of Tartaglia's death and the last three published posthumously by his literary executor and publisher Curtio Troiano in 1560. David Eugene Smith wrote of the General Trattato that it was:/nthe best treatise on arithmetic that appeared in Italy in his century, containing a very full discussion of the numerical operations and the commercial rules of the Italian arithmeticians. The life of the people, the customs of the merchants, and the efforts at improving arithmetic in the 16th century are all set forth in this remarkable work.[15]/nPart I is 554 pages long and constitutes essentially commercial arithmetic, taking up such topics as basic operations with the complex currencies of the day (ducats, soldi, pizolli, and so on), exchanging currencies, calculating interest, and dividing profits into joint companies. The book is replete with worked examples with much emphasis on methods and rules (that is, algorithms), all ready to use virtually as is.[16]/nPart II takes up more general arithmetic problems, including progressions, powers, binomial expansions, Tartaglia's triangle (also known as \"Pascal's triangle\"), calculations with roots, and proportions / fractions.[17]/nPart IV concerns triangles, regular polygons, the Platonic solids, and Archimedean topics like the quadrature of the circle and circumscribing a cylinder around a sphere.[18]/nTartaglia was proficient with binomial expansions and included many worked examples in Part II of the General Trattato, one a detailed explanation of how to calculate the summands of \n\n\n\n(\n6\n+\n4\n\n)\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (6+4)^{7}}\n\n, including the appropriate binomial coefficients.[19]/nTartaglia knew of Pascal's triangle one hundred years before Pascal, as shown in this image from the General Trattato. His examples are numeric, but he thinks about it geometrically, the horizontal line \n\n\n\na\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ab}\n\n at the top of the triangle being broken into two segments \n\n\n\na\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ac}\n\n and \n\n\n\nc\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle cb}\n\n, where point \n\n\n\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c}\n\n is the apex of the triangle. Binomial expansions amount to taking \n\n\n\n(\na\nc\n+\nc\nb\n\n)\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (ac+cb)^{n}}\n\n for exponents \n\n\n\nn\n=\n2\n,\n3\n,\n4\n,\n\u22ef\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n=2,3,4,\\cdots }\n\n as you go down the triangle.

He writes explicitly about the additive formation rule, that (for example) the adjacent 15 and 20 in the fifth row add up to 35, which appears beneath them in the sixth row.[20]/nTartaglia is perhaps best known today for his conflicts with Gerolamo Cardano. In 1539, Cardano cajoled Tartaglia into revealing his solution to the cubic equations by promising not to publish them. Tartaglia divulged the secrets of the solutions of three different forms of the cubic equation in verse.[21] Several years later, Cardano happened to see unpublished work by Scipione del Ferro who independently came up with the same solution as Tartaglia.  (Tartaglia had previously been challenged by del Ferro's student Fiore, which made Tartaglia aware that a solution existed.)[22]/nAs the unpublished work was dated before Tartaglia's, Cardano decided his promise could be broken and included Tartaglia's solution in his next publication. Even though Cardano credited his discovery, Tartaglia was extremely upset and a famous public challenge match resulted between himself and Cardano's student, Ludovico Ferrari. Widespread stories that Tartaglia devoted the rest of his life to ruining Cardano, however, appear to be completely fabricated.[23] Mathematical historians now credit both Cardano and Tartaglia with the formula to solve cubic equations, referring to it as the \"Cardano\u2013Tartaglia formula\"./nTartaglia was a prodigious calculator and master of solid geometry. In Part IV of the General Trattato he shows by example how to calculate the height of a pyramid on a triangular base, that is, an irregular tetrahedron.[24]/nThe base of the pyramid is a \n\n\n\n13\n\u2212\n14\n\u2212\n15\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 13-14-15}\n\n triangle \n\n\n\nb\nc\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle bcd}\n\n, with edges of length \n\n\n\n20\n,\n18\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 20,18}\n\n, and \n\n\n\n16\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 16}\n\n rising up to the apex \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n from points \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n, \n\n\n\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c}\n\n, and \n\n\n\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d}\n\n respectively. Base triangle \n\n\n\nb\nc\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle bcd}\n\n partitions into \n\n\n\n5\n\u2212\n12\n\u2212\n13\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 5-12-13}\n\n and \n\n\n\n9\n\u2212\n12\n\u2212\n15\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 9-12-15}\n\n triangles by dropping the perpendicular from point \n\n\n\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d}\n\n to side \n\n\n\nb\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle bc}\n\n. He proceeds to erect a triangle in the plane perpendicular to line \n\n\n\nb\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle bc}\n\n through the pyramid's apex, point \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n, calculating all three sides of this triangle and noting that its height is the height of the pyramid.

The final (correct) answer is:/nThe volume of the pyramid is easily gotten after that (not that Tartaglia gives it):/nSimon Stevin invented decimal fractions later in the sixteenth century, so the last figure would have been foreign to Tartaglia, who always used fractions. All the same, his approach is in some ways a modern one, suggesting by example an algorithm for calculating the height of most or all irregular tetrahedra, but (as usual for him) he gives no explicit formula.", "42096259": "Ferdinand Franz Wallraf (20 July 1748 - 18 March 1824) was a German botanist, mathematician, theologian, art collector and Roman Catholic priest.

By 1788, he was a Doctor of medicine and philosophy. In 1795, he was also made a Canon at the Basilica of the Holy Apostles. From 1793 to 1796. he served as a Rector at the Universitas. He used his own resources to restore the botanical gardens on the Zeughausstra\u00dfe for research purposes.[1]/nWhen the Universitas was abolished by the French in 1798, during their occupation of the Left Bank of the Rhine, Wallraf became a teacher at its successor, the short-lived University of Cologne, in ine department of Belles Lettres. Although he swore an oath to the university, he refused to swear one to the First Republic. He was also named the \"Conservateur des monuments\".[2] It was then that he began his own collecting in earnest; meant to eventually restore that of the Universitas. His collection included Roman excavation pieces, various medieval paintings, religious works of art, manuscripts and early prints, coins, fossils, historical weapons and sculptures./nIn 1809, in his capacity as Conservateur, he was commissioned to design the new Melaten cemetery, using the P\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery in Paris as a model. His plans included a recreational area and a green commons. That same year, together with his fellow teacher Johann Caspar Schug (1766\u20131818), he founded the \"Olympic Society\", devoted to cultivating art and literature, as well as preserving Cologne's unique dialect and humor.[3]/nIn 1812, Mayor Johann Jakob von Wittgenstein\u00a0[de] passed along an order from the French government, engaging Wallraf to propose new, French names for the streets of Cologne. If possible, he was to use cognates from Old High German and Middle High German.[4] To achieve this, he held frequent consultations with the printer and publisher,  Theodor Franz Thiriart\u00a0[de], who offered many helpful suggestions. He also took the opportunity to change mildly offensive names. For example; \"Pi\u00dfgasse\" became \"Passage de la Bourse\". (B\u00f6rseng\u00e4ssche). House numbering was reorganized according to the directions of General Charles Daurier\u00a0[fr], to make addresses more logically sequential. In 1813, Thiriart published the first Street Directory in French; the Itin\u00e9raire de Cologne.[5]/nHe died in 1824 and was buried at the cemetery he had designed. The work of cataloguing his collection took almost two years. It was exhibited from 1827 to 1860 in what was known as the \"Wallrafianum\".

In the same article, Piontkovsky stated that the putinism is the terminal shot to the head of Russia, and also he compared Yeltsin to Hindenburg who gave Hitler the power./nHe was an executive director of the Strategic Studies Center (Moscow) think tank that has been closed since 2006. He contributes regularly to Novaya Gazeta, The Moscow Times, The Russia Journal and the online journals Grani.ru[8] and Transitions Online.[9] He is also a regular political commentator for the BBC World Service and Radio Liberty in Moscow. He has been an outspoken critic of Putin's \"managed\" democracy in Russia and, as such, has described Russia as a \"soft totalitarian regime\"[10] and \"hybrid fascism.\"[11]/nPiontkovsky is a member of the American Mathematical Society.\nPiontkovsky is the author of several books on the Putin presidency in Russia, including his most recent book, Another Look Into Putin's Soul.[12][13]/nPiontkovsky is one of the 34 first signatories of the online anti-Putin manifesto \"Putin Must Go\", published on 10 March 2010. In his subsequent articles he has repeatedly stressed its importance and urged citizens to sign it.[14]/nOn 26 June 2013, Piontkovsky commented the case of Edward Snowden by saying, \"If Pushkov dares to draw a parallel between Snowden and Soviet dissidents, I must respond that none of them had anything to do with Soviet special services and none of them pledged not to betray state and departmental secrets.\"[15]/nPiontkovsky compared the Crimean speech of Vladimir Putin in 2014 to Hitler's speech on Sudetenland in 1939. He described Putin as using \"the same arguments and vision of history\" and beyond that, that this speech played a key role in starting the war in Donbas.[16]/nIn 2016 he published an article \"\u0411\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0430, \u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f\" (\"A bomb that is ready to explode\") about Russian-Chechen ethnic conflict.[17] When the General Prosecutor Office found his article \"extremist\" and started criminal prosecution [18] Piontkovsky at last left Russia on 19 February 2016.[19][20][21]/nPiontkovsky adduces Igor Girkin's name among those of like-minded persons and says, \"The authentic high-principled Hitlerites, true Aryans Dugin, Prokhanov, Prosvirnin\u00a0[ru], Kholmogorov\u00a0[ru], Girkin, Prilepin are a marginalized minority in Russia.\"[22][23] Piontkovsky adds, \"Putin has stolen the ideology of the Russian Reich from the domestic Hitlerites, he has preventively burned them down, using their help to do so, hundreds of their most active supporters in the furnace of the Ukrainian Vend\u00e9e.\"[22][23] In his interview with Radio Liberty, Piontkovsky says that maybe the meaning of the operation conducted by Putin is to reveal all these potential passionate leaders of social revolt, send them to Ukraine and burn them in the furnace of the Ukrainian Vend\u00e9e.[24] In the interviews Andrey also argues that the ideology of Rashism is in many ways similar to German fascism (Nazism), while in speeches and policies of the President Putin it's similar to the ideas of Hitler.[25][26]", "1791662": "William George Penney, Baron Penney, OM, KBE, FRS, FRSE (24 June 1909\u00a0\u2013 3 March 1991) was an English mathematician and professor of mathematical physics at the Imperial College London and later the rector of Imperial College London. He had a leading role in the development of High Explosive Research, Britain's clandestine nuclear programme that started in 1942 during the Second World War which produced the first British atomic bomb in 1952./nAs the head of the British delegation working on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos Laboratory, Penney initially carried out calculations to predict the damage effects generated by the blast wave of an atomic bomb. Upon returning home, Penney directed the British nuclear weapons directorate, codenamed Tube Alloys and directed scientific research at the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment which resulted in the first detonation of a British nuclear bomb in Operation Hurricane in 1952. After the test, Penney became chief advisor to the new United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). He was later chairman of the authority, which he used in international negotiations to control nuclear testing with the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty./nPenney's notable scientific contributions included the mathematics for complex wave dynamics, both in shock and gravity waves, proposing optimisation problems and solutions in hydrodynamics (which plays a major role in materials science and metallurgy.) During his later years, Penney lectured in mathematics and physics; he was the Rector of Imperial College London 1967\u20131973./nWilliam George Penney was born in Gibraltar on 24 June 1909, the oldest child and only son of William Alfred Penney, a sergeant-major in the British Army's Ordnance Corps who was then serving overseas, and Blanche Evelyn Johnson, who had worked as a cashier before her marriage.[1] His parents moved about frequently, but Penney did not always accompany them. After the outbreak of the First World War, Penney, his mother and his sisters moved to Sheerness, Kent, where he went to primary school. He then attended a school near Colchester, and finally, was at Sheerness Technical School for Boys from 1924 to 1926, where he displayed a talent for science. He participated in boxing and athletics, winning the school's 100-yard (91\u00a0m) dash. He also played cricket, and he was centre-forward on the school football team.[2]/nIn 1927, Penney's passion for science landed him in a local science laboratory where he worked for 10 shillings a week (equivalent to \u00a332 in 2021) as a laboratory assistant.[2] This helped him to gain a Kent county scholarship and a royal scholarship to the Royal College of Science (RCS), a constituent college of Imperial College London. He played centre-forward on the RCS soccer team. He was permitted to skip the first year of the course, and graduated in 1929, obtaining his Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics with First Class Honours at age 20. His talent was recognised by the Governor's Prize for Mathematics from the faculty of science.[1][3]/nPenney was offered a research position at the London University, where he studied for a doctorate. He spent a term at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands,[3] where he worked with Ralph Kronig. Together, they developed the Kronig\u2013Penney model, which described the motions of electrons in periodic fields.[4] Penney was awarded his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Mathematics in 1931.[3]  He accepted a Commonwealth Fund Fellowship and travelled to the United States, where he became foreign research associate at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, studying under John H. Van Vleck, and was awarded a Master of Arts degree.[3] While in the United States he visited Carl Anderson's laboratory at the California Institute of Technology and Ernest Lawrence's Radiation Laboratory at the University of California. He was a guest at Robert Oppenheimer's ranch in New Mexico, saw Babe Ruth play baseball, and was a spectator at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics.[1]/nOn returning to England in 1933, Penney was granted the 1851 Exhibition Scholarship to attend Trinity College, Cambridge.[1] He changed his mathematical career to physics, and conducted a thorough research and theoretical investigation into the structure of metals and the magnetic properties of crystals with John Lennard-Jones.[4] In 1935, Penney submitted his final thesis, which contained the fundamental work in the applications of quantum mechanics to the physics of crystals. The University of Cambridge awarded him a PhD  in 1935 and a Doctor of Science in Mathematical Physics in 1936.[1] In 1936, he was elected to the Stokes studentship at Pembroke College, Cambridge, but in the same year he returned to London and was appointed Reader in Mathematics at Imperial College London, a post he held from 1936 to 1945.[1] On 27 July 1935, Penney married Adele Minnie Elms, a university student from Kent he had known since his days in Sheerness. They had two sons, Martin, who was born in 1938, and Christopher, who was born in 1941.[1][5]/nPenney registered himself as available for scientific war work, but heard nothing for several months after the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939. He was then approached by Geoffrey Taylor. Taylor was an expert on fluid dynamics, and was dealing with more questions from government departments regarding the effects of explosions than he had time to answer. He asked Penney if he could investigate the behaviour of an underwater explosion. Penney became a member of the Physics of Explosives Committee (Physex), and reported his results to another committee, Undex, which was run by the Admiralty and was interested in underwater explosions such as those created by mines, torpedoes and depth charges, and their effects on the hulls of ships and submarines. Most of the data on underwater explosions was from the First World War.[6]/nWith Royal Navy engineer officers Penney designed and supervised development of Bombardon breakwaters, steel structures that formed part of the Mulberry harbours that were placed off the Normandy beaches after the D-Day invasion. These mobile breakwaters protected landing craft and troops from the Atlantic rollers. Penney's job was to calculate the effects of waves on the Bombardons and devise the most efficient arrangement of them.[6]/nThe August 1943 Quebec Agreement provided for British support of the American Manhattan Project, which aimed to develop atomic bombs.[7] Over the objections of the Admiralty and Imperial College, Penney was sent to join the team of British scientists at the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, where expertise on explosions and their effects was in demand.[8] At Los Alamos Penney gained recognition for his scientific talents, and also for his leadership qualities and ability to work in harmony with others. Within a few weeks of his arrival he was added to the core group of scientists making key decisions in the direction of the programme.[9] Major General Leslie Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project, later wrote:/nThroughout the life of the project, vital decisions were reached only after the most careful consideration and discussion with the men I thought were able to offer the soundest advice. Generally, for this operation, they were Oppenheimer, Von Neumann, Penney, Parsons and Ramsey.[10]/nOne of Penney's assignments at Los Alamos was to predict the damage effects from the blast wave of an atomic bomb. Soon after he arrived at Los Alamos, he gave a talk on the subject. Fellow Manhattan Project scientist Rudolf Peierls recalled that:/nSoon after his arrival he gave a talk about the effect of blast waves on people, including many gruesome details to which his American audience was not accustomed. He presented all this with his usual cheerful manner, and so acquired for a time the sobriquet \"the smiling killer.\"[4]/nPenney's wife never recovered from post-natal depression after Christopher's birth, and died on 18 April 1945. He arranged for Joan Quennell, a nurse, to look after the boys.[1][5] He wanted to return home, but Groves told  James Chadwick, the British liaison to Manhattan Project in Washington, D.C., that Penney was too important to the project to be released. On 27 April 1945 Penney went to Washington for a target selection meeting. He gave advice regarding the height of the detonation which would ensure optimum destructive effects, whilst ensuring the fireball did not touch the earth, thereby avoiding permanent radiation contamination on the ground. The committee selected four cities from a list of seventeen. Penney attempted to forecast casualties and damage effects, but this was difficult because the exact energy of the bombs was not known.[11] This was answered by the Trinity test detonation on 16 July 1945. Penney was assigned as an observer on an aircraft, but the flight was cancelled due to bad weather, and he did not witness the test.[12] Five days later, Penney gave a presentation on the results of the test, during which he predicted that the bomb would level a city of three or four hundred thousand people.[13]/nThe following month Penney went to Tinian Island as part of Project Alberta, the group of scientists and military personnel that assembled the atomic bombs. Along with Royal Air Force (RAF) Group Captain Leonard Cheshire from the British Joint Staff Mission in Washington, he represented the United Kingdom. The American authorities stopped them observing the bombing of Hiroshima but, after an appeal to Chadwick, they were permitted to accompany the second mission. On 9 August 1945 Penney witnessed the bombing of Nagasaki, flying with Cheshire in the B-29 observation plane Big Stink. Big Stink missed its rendezvous with the bomber Bockscar, so they witnessed the flash of the Nagasaki detonation from the air at too great a distance to photograph the fireball and the target was obscured by clouds.[14] As the leading expert on the effects of explosions, Penney was a member of the team of scientists and military analysts who entered Hiroshima and Nagasaki following the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945 to assess the effects of nuclear weapons.[15]/nPenney returned to the United Kingdom on a civilian flight from the United States in September 1945. He brought artefacts from Hiroshima and Nagasaki with him, and was charged  \u00a3450 (equivalent to \u00a321,000 in 2021) for excess baggage.[15] He married Joan Quennell on 3 November 1945.[1] Penney returned to Imperial College, where he wrote a report on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He estimated that the bomb dropped on the former had a yield of 10 kilotons of TNT (42\u00a0TJ) and that of the Nagasaki bomb of about 30 kilotons of TNT (130\u00a0TJ). He wanted to return to academic life, and he was offered a chair of mathematics at the University of Oxford.[5]/nAt the end of the war the British government, now under the Labour Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, believed that America would share the technology that British leaders saw as a joint discovery under the terms of the 1943 Quebec Agreement and the 1944 Hyde Park Agreement.[16] In December 1945, Attlee ordered the construction of an atomic pile to produce plutonium and requested a report to detail requirements for Britain's atomic bombs.[17] Penney was approached by C. P. Snow and asked to take up post as Chief Superintendent Armament Research (CSAR, called \"Caesar\") at Fort Halstead in Kent, as he suspected Britain was going to build an atomic bomb of its own and he wanted Penney in this job. As CSAR he was responsible for all types of armaments research.[18]/nIn 1946, at the request of Groves and the United States Navy, Penney returned to the United States where he was put in charge of the blast effects studies for Operation Crossroads at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands in July 1946.[17] He wrote the after action reports on the effects of the two nuclear detonations. His reputation was further enhanced when, after the sophisticated test gauges failed in the Able test due to the bomb missing the intended target, he was able to determine the yield using observations from simple devices made from petrol tins. The second test, Baker, was an underwater test, and it impressed Penney greatly. He speculated on the possible effects if an atomic bomb was exploded near a port city in the UK.[19]/nThe passage of the McMahon Act (Atomic Energy Act) in August 1946 made it clear that Britain would no longer be allowed access to US atomic research. Penney left the United States and returned to the United Kingdom where he drew up plans for an atomic weapons section in his department, submitting them to the Controller of Production, Atomic Energy, Marshal of the Royal Air Force Lord Portal, in November 1946.[20] In January 1947, Penney went to the United States to attend a symposium on the Crossroads tests. With almost all other aspects of atomic co-operation between the countries at an end, his personal role was seen as keeping the contact alive between the parties. He returned to the UK at the end of February 1947.[21]/nAttlee's government decided that Britain required the atomic bomb to maintain its great power status.[22][23] In the words of the Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, \"We've got to have this thing over here, whatever it costs\u00a0... We've got to have the bloody Union Jack flying on top of it.\"[24][25] Officially, the decision to proceed with the British atomic bomb project was made in January 1947. The government also endorsed Portal's proposal to place Penney in charge of the bomb development effort.[26] The project was based at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, and was code-named \"High Explosive Research\" (HER).[27] In May 1947, Penney was officially named to head the HER project.[26] The following month he began assembling teams of scientists and engineers to work on the new technologies that had to be developed. He gathered 34 senior members of his fledgling team in the library at the Royal Arsenal and gave a two-hour talk on the principles of how to build an atomic bomb.[27]/nBy mid-1948, it was clear that Penney's initial estimate that he would require 220 staff was wide of the mark, and that he would need nearly 500. This meant not only taking personnel from other projects, but scrapping some entirely.[28] In October 1948, he submitted a request for developing a new, separate site for HER on grounds of safety, security and economy.[29] This was approved, but it took another six months to locate a suitable site. A former airbase, RAF Aldermaston, was selected.[30]/nAt the same time, it was decided to separate HER from the Armaments Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE). This resulted in a painful bureaucratic battle over personnel whose expertise was wanted for research on both nuclear weapons and guided missiles. In the end, HER kept 25 of the 30 key personnel that AWRE wanted. The site was taken over on 1\u00a0April 1950. Penney became Chief Superintendent High Explosive Research (CSHER).[31] The first stage of work at Aldermaston was completed in December 1951, but the plutonium processing building was only handed over in April 1952, the month that the first plutonium was due to arrive from Windscale. At the peak of construction in 1953, over 4,000 personnel were working on the site.[32] On 3 October 1952, under the code-name \"Operation Hurricane\", the first British nuclear device was successfully detonated off the west coast of Australia in the Monte Bello Islands.[33]/nHurricane was but the first series of British nuclear weapons tests in Australia. Further tests required a site on land, so Penney visited Australia and chose a site at Emu Field in South Australia for the Operation Totem test series in 1953.[34] Emu Field proved too remote, so Penney selected a more accessible site at Maralinga. The decision to develop a British hydrogen bomb meant that certain scientific information was urgently required and Maralinga was not yet ready, so a second series of tests, Operation Mosaic, was conducted in the Monte Bello Islands in 1956.[35] The subsequent Operation Buffalo tests were carried out at Maralinga in September and October 1956.[36] Penney personally supervised the Totem and Buffalo tests.[37]/nPenney was aware of the public relations issues associated with the tests, and made clear-speaking presentations to the Australian press. Before one series of tests, Lord Carrington,  the High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Australia, described Penney's press presence: \"Sir William Penney has established in Australia a reputation which is quite unique: his appearance, his obvious sincerity and honesty, and the general impression he gives that he would rather be digging his garden \u2013 and would be, but for the essential nature of his work \u2013 have made him a public figure of some magnitude in Australian eyes\".[38][39]/nBritain felt the need to quickly develop megaton-class weapons because it seemed that atmospheric testing could soon be outlawed by treaty. As a result, the UK wanted to demonstrate its ability to manufacture megaton-class weapons by proof-testing them before any legal prohibitions were in place. The Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, hoped to convince the US to change the McMahon Act, which prohibited sharing information even with the British, by demonstrating that the UK had the technology to make a thermonuclear weapon (an H-bomb), and he put Penney in charge of developing this bomb. The Orange Herald bomb was developed and was passed off as a thermonuclear bomb, when in fact it was a boosted fission weapon in which little of the energy came from fusion.[40] The reports were unlikely to have fooled the American observers.[41] The subsequent successful development of British thermonuclear weapons, which coincided with the Sputnik crisis led to the amendment of the McMahon Act, and the re-establishment of the nuclear Special Relationship with the United States.[42]/nIn the late 1950s there was domestic and international pressure to discontinue atmospheric nuclear testing. Penney headed the UK delegation at a conference convened in Geneva on 1 July 1958. Macmillan took Penney along as an advisor to the conference in Bermuda in December 1961, where Macmillan met with President John F. Kennedy and concluded the Nassau Agreement. Penney continued as the government's advisor on arms control and participated in the preliminary discussion leading up to, and the signing of, the   Partial Test Ban Treaty in Moscow in July 1963.[43]/nNuclear development was transferred from the Ministry of Supply (MoS) to the newly formed United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA).[44] Penney became a member of the UKAEA Board in 1954,[45] and he chaired its official inquiry in the 1957 Windscale fire. When Sir John Cockcroft left in 1959 to become the master of Churchill College, Cambridge, Penney succeeded him as the Member for Scientific Research. He became deputy chairman in 1961 and chairman in 1964.[38] The UKAEA had a difficult working relationship with the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB). Penney's management style was to avoid confrontation and seek consensus whenever possible, and the role of the UKAEA in the nuclear power industry was an advisory one. He endorsed the CEGB's 1966 decision to develop the Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor. He took the decision to proceed with the Prototype Fast Reactor at Dounreay and to upgrade the uranium enrichment plant at Capenhurst.[46]/nPenney was Rector of Imperial College London from 1967 to 1973. The job was far more trying than he anticipated, and there was no time for personal research. The university sector had expanded rapidly in the 1960s, and there were many personnel and financial difficulties to contend with. There was staff and student unrest that he had to deal with. Penney agreed to have student observers on the Board of Studies, and he brokered deals with the Association of University Teachers. Imperial College now had direct access to University Grants Committee funding and was no longer dependent on the University of London but money was still tight. Careful financial management created a surplus of income over expenditure.[47] The college named the William Penney Laboratory at the South Kensington campus, which opened in 1988, in his honour.[48] He served as the first chairman of the UK's Standing Committee on Structural Safety from 1976 to 1982.[49]/nPenney was made a  Fellow of the Royal Society in 1946.  He was its treasurer from 1956 to 1960 and vice-president from  1958 to 1969.[45] He became a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1962,[50] a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1970,[51] and a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1973.[52] He received the  Wilhelm Exner Medal in 1967.[53] Among the honours he received in 1969 was the Rumford Medal by the Royal Society, the Glazebrook Medal and Prize of the Institute of Physics and the James Alfred Ewing Medal of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and he was awarded the Kelvin Gold Medal the following year.[51] He was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Melbourne in 1956, the University of Durham in 1957, the University of Oxford in 1959, the University of Bath in 1966 and by the University of Reading in 1970.[51] For his services to the United States, he was awarded the Medal of Freedom in 1946.[54]\nPenney was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1946,[55] and was raised to Knight Commander of the order in 1952.[56] He was made a life peer, taking the title Baron Penney, of East Hendred in the Royal County of Berkshire on 7 July 1967,[57] and was awarded the Order of Merit in 1969.[58] As a life peer he was entitled to sit in the House of Lords, but did so only twelve times between 1967 and 1973, and voted for only three bills: for sanctions on Rhodesia in 1968, for an amendment to the redistribution bill in 1969, and for the accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities in 1970.[37]/nIn later years he admitted to qualms about his work but felt it was necessary. When aggressively questioned by the McClelland Royal Commission investigating the test programmes at Monte Bello and Maralinga in 1985, he acknowledged that at least one of the twelve tests had unsafe levels of fallout. However, he maintained that due care was taken and that the tests conformed to the internationally accepted safety standards of the time.[38] Jim McClelland broadly accepted Penney's view but anecdotal evidence to the contrary received wide coverage in the press. By promoting a more Australian nationalist view, then current in the government of Bob Hawke, McClelland had also identified \"villains\" in the previous Australian and British administrations. As a senior witness Penney bore the brunt of the allegations, and his health was badly affected by the experience. He was diagnosed with cancer in 1991, and died on 3 March 1991 at his home in the village of East Hendred, aged 81.[1][59] He burned his personal papers before he died.[48]/nIn Penney's obituary in the New York Times he was credited as the \"father of the British bomb\".[60] The Guardian described him as its \"guiding light\" and his scientific and administrative leadership was said to be crucial in its successful and timely creation.[61] His leadership of the team that exploded the first British hydrogen bomb at Christmas Island was instrumental in restoring the exchange of nuclear technology between Britain and the US in 1958,[40] and he was credited as playing a leading part in the negotiations which led to the Partial Test Ban Treaty in 1963.[62] His Kronig-Penney model for the behaviour of an electron in a periodic potential is still taught and used today in solid-state physics and is used to explain the origin of band gaps.[63]", "16176815": "John Gough (/\u0261\u0252f/ GOF; 17 January 1757 \u2013 28 July 1825) was a blind English natural and experimental philosopher who is known for his own investigations as well as the influence he had on both John Dalton and William Whewell./nJohn Gough was born in Kendal, Westmorland, on 17 January 1757, the eldest child of Nathan Gough (d. 1800) and his wife, Susannah (1731\u20131798). Gough's father was a wool dyer and shearman dyer,[1] while his mother was the eldest daughter of John Wilson, a prosperous farmer with an estate on the west bank of Windermere. Nathan and Susannah Gough had three sons and four daughters, one of whom died in infancy. The family belonged to the Society of Friends, whose communities flourished in Cumberland and Westmorland during this period. Before he was three years old, Gough was attacked by smallpox and lost his sight. In his childhood he expended much effort in developing his sense of touch and hearing, and appears to have been especially eager to learn to recognize animals by touch./nIn 1778 at the age of twenty-one, Gough became a resident pupil of John Slee, a mathematical master at Mungrisdale, Cumberland. Gough stayed at Mungrisdale for eighteen months, following the traditional curriculum up to the elementary principles of calculus. Returning home he took up calculus, with his second sister, Dorothy Gough (b. 1768), acting as his reader. From around 1782 to 1790 he enjoyed the acquaintance of John Dalton, a cousin of George Bewley and also a lakeland Quaker, who had come to Kendal to take up a position in Bewley's school.  Dalton assisted Gough by reading, writing, and making calculations and diagrams on his behalf. In return Dalton, who later became one of the most eminent figures in nineteenth-century science, was tutored by Gough in Latin and Greek.  Dalton later referred to Gough as a \"prodigy in scientific attainments.\"[2]/nIn 1800 at the parish church of Kendal, Gough married Mary (d. 1858), daughter of Thomas Harrison of Crosthwaite, Cumberland. On their marriage they moved to Middleshaw in the hamlet of Old Hutton.  John and Mary Gough had nine children, one of whom, Thomas Gough (1804\u00a0\u2013 1880) became a surgeon in Kendal./nIn 1812 Gough had a house, which he named Fowl Ing, built for himself and his family on the south-west slope of Benson Knot, a hill 2 miles north-east of Kendal. At about the same time he began to act as a private tutor of mathematics to a select group of pupils from northern England, whom he prepared for university. The subsequent fame of his students superseded his own celebrity. A number of them went on to achieve high distinction in the mathematical tripos, and subsequently in the hierarchies of university and church. One of Gough's first students was William Whewell, who was with him in 1812 and later described Gough as \"a very extraordinary person.\"[3]/nFrom 1823, John Gough had repeated attacks of epilepsy.  He died on 28 July 1825, leaving his wife and seven of their children. He was buried in the parish churchyard of Kendal./nGough had wide-ranging scientific interests. He published papers in natural history, mechanics, mathematics, chemistry, and experimental physics./nOne of his most interesting pieces of work was an investigation into the properties of natural rubber or Caoutchouc. He was the first to describe the heat released when a rubber band is quickly stretched, the heat being detected by the lips to which the band is pressed. When stretched rubber is heated, it contracts, a reversal of the normal behaviour of materials when heated.

Her father, Andrew Gustav Johnson, was a furniture dealer and undertaker. Her mother, Amelia (n\u00e9e Friberg), was a homemaker. Both of Johnson's parents came from the parish of Lyrestad, in V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland, Sweden. Johnson had two older siblings, Esther and Elmer.[2] At the age of nine her family moved to Akron, Iowa and she was enrolled in a private school. In 1899 she joined her sister at the University of South Dakota where they took many of the same classes.[2] She graduated in 1903 and began graduate work at the University of Iowa. Her thesis, titled The extension of Galois theory to linear differential equations, earned her a master's degree in 1904. She obtained a second graduate degree one year later from Radcliffe College, where she took courses from Maxime B\u00f4cher and William Fogg Osgood.[1][3][4]/nIn 1905 she won an Alice Freeman Palmer Fellowship from Wellesley College to spend a year at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where she studied under David Hilbert, Felix Klein, Hermann Minkowski, and Karl Schwarzschild. As she worked toward a doctorate, her relationship with Alexander Pell, a former professor from the University of South Dakota, intensified. He traveled to G\u00f6ttingen and they were married in July 1907.[3][4] This trip posed a significant threat to Pell's life, since he was a former Russian double agent whose real name was Sergey Degayev.[3]/nAfter the wedding, the Pells returned to Vermillion, South Dakota, where she taught classes in the theory of functions and differential equations. By 1908 she was back in G\u00f6ttingen, working on her dissertation;[5] an argument with Hilbert, however, made its completion impossible. She moved with her husband to Chicago, where she worked with E. H. Moore to finish her dissertation, Biorthogonal Systems of Functions with Applications to the Theory of Integral Equations, and received a Ph.D. in 1909.[3][4][6]/nShe began looking for a teaching position, but found hostility in every mathematics department.

He made significant contributions to the fields of analysis, number theory, and both classical and celestial mechanics./nIn 1766, on the recommendation of Swiss Leonhard Euler and French d'Alembert, Lagrange succeeded Euler as the director of mathematics at the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, Prussia, where he stayed for over twenty years, producing volumes of work and winning several prizes of the French Academy of Sciences. Lagrange's treatise on analytical mechanics (M\u00e9canique analytique, 4. ed., 2 vols. Paris: Gauthier-Villars et fils, 1788\u201389), written in Berlin and first published in 1788, offered the most comprehensive treatment of classical mechanics since Newton and formed a basis for the development of mathematical physics in the nineteenth century./nIn 1787, at age 51, he moved from Berlin to Paris and became a member of the French Academy of Sciences. He remained in France until the end of his life. He was instrumental in the decimalisation in Revolutionary France, became the first professor of analysis at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique upon its opening in 1794, was a founding member of the Bureau des Longitudes, and became Senator in 1799./nLagrange was one of the creators of the calculus of variations, deriving the Euler\u2013Lagrange equations for extrema of functionals. He extended the method to include possible constraints, arriving at the method of Lagrange multipliers.\nLagrange invented the method of solving differential equations known as variation of parameters, applied differential calculus to the theory of probabilities and worked on solutions for algebraic equations. He proved that every natural number is a sum of four squares. His treatise Theorie des fonctions analytiques laid some of the foundations of group theory, anticipating Galois. In calculus, Lagrange developed a novel approach to interpolation and Taylor's theorem. He studied the three-body problem for the Earth, Sun and Moon (1764) and the movement of Jupiter's satellites (1766), and in 1772 found the special-case solutions to this problem that yield what are now known as Lagrangian points. Lagrange is best known for transforming Newtonian mechanics into a branch of analysis, Lagrangian mechanics. He presented the mechanical \"principles\" as simple results of the variational calculus./nIn appearance he was of medium height, and slightly formed, with pale blue eyes and a colourless complexion. In character he was nervous and timid, he detested controversy, and to avoid it willingly allowed others to take the credit for what he had himself done./nHe always thought out the subject of his papers before he began to compose them, and usually wrote them straight off without a single erasure or correction./nW.W. Rouse Ball[9]/nFirstborn of eleven children as Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia, Lagrange was of Italian and French descent.[7] His paternal great-grandfather was a French captain of cavalry, whose family originated from the French region of Tours.[7] After serving under Louis XIV, he had entered the service of Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy, and married a Conti from the noble Roman family.[7] Lagrange's father, Giuseppe Francesco Lodovico, was doctor in Law at the University of Torino, while his mother was the only child of a rich doctor of Cambiano, in the countryside of Turin.[7][10] He was raised as a Roman Catholic (but later on became an agnostic).[11]/nHis father, who had charge of the king's military chest and was Treasurer of the Office of Public Works and Fortifications in Turin, should have maintained a good social position and wealth, but before his son grew up he had lost most of his property in speculations. A career as a lawyer was planned out for Lagrange by his father,[7] and certainly Lagrange seems to have accepted this willingly. He studied at the University of Turin and his favourite subject was classical Latin. At first he had no great enthusiasm for mathematics, finding Greek geometry rather dull./nIt was not until he was seventeen that he showed any taste for mathematics \u2013 his interest in the subject being first excited by a paper by Edmond Halley from 1693[12]\nwhich he came across by accident. Alone and unaided he threw himself into mathematical studies; at the end of a year's incessant toil he was already an accomplished mathematician. Charles Emmanuel III appointed Lagrange to serve as the \"Sostituto del Maestro di Matematica\" (mathematics assistant professor) at the Royal Military Academy of the Theory and Practice of Artillery in 1755, where he taught courses in calculus and mechanics to support the Piedmontese army's early adoption of the ballistics theories of Benjamin Robins and Leonhard Euler.  In that capacity, Lagrange was the first to teach calculus in an engineering school.  According to Alessandro Papacino D'Antoni, the academy's military commander and famous artillery theorist, Lagrange unfortunately proved to be a problematic professor with his oblivious teaching style, abstract reasoning, and impatience with artillery and fortification-engineering applications.[13] In this academy one of his students was Fran\u00e7ois Daviet.[14]/nLagrange is one of the founders of the calculus of variations. Starting in 1754, he worked on the problem of the tautochrone, discovering a method of maximizing and minimizing functionals in a way similar to finding extrema of functions. Lagrange wrote several letters to Leonhard Euler between 1754 and 1756 describing his results. He outlined his \"\u03b4-algorithm\", leading to the Euler\u2013Lagrange equations of variational calculus and considerably simplifying Euler's earlier analysis.[15] Lagrange also applied his ideas to problems of classical mechanics, generalising the results of Euler and Maupertuis./nEuler was very impressed with Lagrange's results. It has been stated that \"with characteristic courtesy he withheld a paper he had previously written, which covered some of the same ground, in order that the young Italian might have time to complete his work, and claim the undisputed invention of the new calculus\"; however, this chivalric view has been disputed.[16] Lagrange published his method in two memoirs of the Turin Society in 1762 and 1773./nIn 1758, with the aid of his pupils (mainly with Daviet), Lagrange established a society, which was subsequently incorporated as the Turin Academy of Sciences, and most of his early writings are to be found in the five volumes of its transactions, usually known as the Miscellanea Taurinensia. Many of these are elaborate papers. The first volume contains a paper on the theory of the propagation of sound; in this he indicates a mistake made by Newton, obtains the general differential equation for the motion, and integrates it for motion in a straight line. This volume also contains the complete solution of the problem of a string vibrating transversely; in this paper he points out a lack of generality in the solutions previously given by Brook Taylor, D'Alembert, and Euler, and arrives at the conclusion that the form of the curve at any time t is given by the equation \n\n\n\ny\n=\na\nsin\n\u2061\n(\nm\nx\n)\nsin\n\u2061\n(\nn\nt\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y=a\\sin(mx)\\sin(nt)\\,}\n\n. The article concludes with a masterly discussion of echoes, beats, and compound sounds. Other articles in this volume are on recurring series, probabilities, and the calculus of variations./nThe second volume contains a long paper embodying the results of several papers in the first volume on the theory and notation of the calculus of variations; and he illustrates its use by deducing the principle of least action, and by solutions of various problems in dynamics./nThe third volume includes the solution of several dynamical problems by means of the calculus of variations; some papers on the integral calculus; a solution of a Fermat's problem: given an integer n which is not a perfect square, to find a number x such that nx2 + 1[verification needed] is a perfect square; and the general differential equations of motion for three bodies moving under their mutual attractions./nThe next work he produced was in 1764 on the libration of the Moon, and an explanation as to why the same face was always turned to the earth, a problem which he treated by the aid of virtual work. His solution is especially interesting as containing the germ of the idea of generalised equations of motion, equations which he first formally proved in 1780./nAlready by 1756, Euler and Maupertuis, seeing Lagrange's mathematical talent, tried to persuade Lagrange to come to Berlin, but he shyly refused the offer. In 1765, d'Alembert interceded on Lagrange's behalf with Frederick of Prussia and by letter, asked him to leave Turin for a considerably more prestigious position in Berlin. He again turned down the offer, responding that[17]:\u200a361/nIn 1766, after Euler left Berlin for Saint Petersburg, Frederick himself wrote to Lagrange expressing the wish of \"the greatest king in Europe\" to have \"the greatest mathematician in Europe\" resident at his court. Lagrange was finally persuaded. He spent the next twenty years in Prussia, where he produced a long series of papers published in the Berlin and Turin transactions, and composed his monumental work, the M\u00e9canique analytique. In 1767, he married his cousin Vittoria Conti./nLagrange was a favourite of the king, who frequently lectured him on the advantages of perfect regularity of life. The lesson was accepted, and Lagrange studied his mind and body as though they were machines, and experimented to find the exact amount of work which he could do before exhaustion. Every night he set himself a definite task for the next day, and on completing any branch of a subject he wrote a short analysis to see what points in the demonstrations or in the subject-matter were capable of improvement. He carefully planned his papers before writing them, usually without a single erasure or correction./nNonetheless, during his years in Berlin, Lagrange's health was rather poor, and that of his wife Vittoria was even worse. She died in 1783 after years of illness and Lagrange was very depressed. In 1786, Frederick II died, and the climate of Berlin became difficult for Lagrange.[10]/nIn 1786, following Frederick's death, Lagrange received similar invitations from states including Spain and Naples, and he accepted the offer of Louis XVI to move to Paris. In France he was received with every mark of distinction and special apartments in the Louvre were prepared for his reception, and he became a member of the French Academy of Sciences, which later became part of the Institut de France (1795). At the beginning of his residence in Paris he was seized with an attack of melancholy, and even the printed copy of his M\u00e9canique on which he had worked for a quarter of a century lay for more than two years unopened on his desk. Curiosity as to the results of the French Revolution first stirred him out of his lethargy, a curiosity which soon turned to alarm as the revolution developed./nIt was about the same time, 1792, that the unaccountable sadness of his life and his timidity moved the compassion of 24-year-old Ren\u00e9e-Fran\u00e7oise-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Le Monnier, daughter of his friend, the astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier. She insisted on marrying him, and proved a devoted wife to whom he became warmly attached./nIn September 1793, the Reign of Terror began. Under intervention of Antoine Lavoisier, who himself was by then already thrown out of the academy along with many other scholars, Lagrange was specifically exempted by name in the decree of October 1793 that ordered all foreigners to leave France. On 4 May 1794, Lavoisier and 27 other tax farmers were arrested and sentenced to death and guillotined on the afternoon after the trial. Lagrange said on the death of Lavoisier:/nThough Lagrange had been preparing to escape from France while there was yet time, he was never in any danger; different revolutionary governments (and at a later time, Napoleon) gave him honours and distinctions. This luckiness or safety may to some extent be due to his life attitude he expressed many years before: \"I believe that, in general, one of the first principles of every wise man is to conform strictly to the laws of the country in which he is living, even when they are unreasonable\".[10] A striking testimony to the respect in which he was held was shown in 1796 when the French commissary in Italy was ordered to attend in full state on Lagrange's father, and tender the congratulations of the republic on the achievements of his son, who \"had done honor to all mankind by his genius, and whom it was the special glory of Piedmont to have produced.\" It may be added that Napoleon, when he attained power, warmly encouraged scientific studies in France, and was a liberal benefactor of them. Appointed senator in 1799, he was the first signer of the S\u00e9natus-consulte which in 1802 annexed his fatherland Piedmont to France.[7] He acquired French citizenship in consequence.[7] The French claimed he was a French mathematician, but the Italians continued to claim him as Italian.[10]/nLagrange was involved in the development of the metric system of measurement in the 1790s. He was offered the presidency of the Commission for the reform of weights and measures (la Commission des Poids et Mesures) when he was preparing to escape. After Lavoisier's death in 1794, it was largely Lagrange who influenced the choice of the metre and kilogram units with decimal subdivision, by the commission of 1799.[18] Lagrange was also one of the founding members of the Bureau des Longitudes in 1795./nIn 1795, Lagrange was appointed to a mathematical chair at the newly established \u00c9cole Normale, which enjoyed only a short existence of four months. His lectures there were elementary; they contain nothing of any mathematical importance, though they do provide a brief historical insight into his reason for proposing undecimal or Base 11 as the base number for the reformed system of weights and measures.[19]:\u200a23\u200a The lectures were published because the professors had to \"pledge themselves to the representatives of the people and to each other neither to read nor to repeat from memory\" [\"Les professeurs aux \u00c9coles Normales ont pris, avec les Repr\u00e9sentants du Peuple, et entr'eux l'engagement de ne point lire ou d\u00e9biter de m\u00e9moire des discours \u00e9crits\"[20]:\u200aiii\u200a]. The discourses were ordered taken down in shorthand to enable the deputies to see how the professors acquitted themselves. It was also thought the published lectures would interest a significant portion of the citizenry [\"Quoique des feuilles st\u00e9nographiques soient essentiellement destin\u00e9es aux \u00e9l\u00e8ves de l'\u00c9cole Normale, on doit pr\u00e9voir qu\u05d9elles seront lues par une grande partie de la Nation\"[20]:\u200av\u200a]./nIn 1794, Lagrange was appointed professor of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique; and his lectures there, described by mathematicians who had the good fortune to be able to attend them, were almost perfect both in form and matter.[citation needed] Beginning with the merest elements, he led his hearers on until, almost unknown to themselves, they were themselves extending the bounds of the subject: above all he impressed on his pupils the advantage of always using general methods expressed in a symmetrical notation./nBut Lagrange does not seem to have been a successful teacher. Fourier, who attended his lectures in 1795, wrote:/nIn 1810, Lagrange started a thorough revision of the M\u00e9canique analytique, but he was able to complete only about two-thirds of it before his death at Paris in 1813, in 128 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9. Napoleon honoured him with the Grand Croix of the Ordre Imp\u00e9rial de la R\u00e9union just two days before he died. He was buried that same year in the Panth\u00e9on in Paris. The inscription on his tomb reads in translation:/nJOSEPH LOUIS LAGRANGE. Senator. Count of the Empire. Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour. Grand Cross of the Imperial Order of the Reunion. Member of the Institute and the Bureau of Longitude. Born in Turin on 25\u00a0January 1736. Died in Paris on 10\u00a0April 1813./nLagrange was extremely active scientifically during twenty years he spent in Berlin. Not only did he produce his M\u00e9canique analytique, but he contributed between one and two hundred papers to the Academy of Turin, the Berlin Academy, and the French Academy. Some of these are really treatises, and all without exception are of a high order of excellence. Except for a short time when he was ill he produced on average about one paper a month. Of these, note the following as amongst the most important./nFirst, his contributions to the fourth and fifth volumes, 1766\u20131773, of the Miscellanea Taurinensia; of which the most important was the one in 1771, in which he discussed how numerous astronomical observations should be combined so as to give the most probable result. And later, his contributions to the first two volumes, 1784\u20131785, of the transactions of the Turin Academy; to the first of which he contributed a paper on the pressure exerted by fluids in motion, and to the second an article on integration by infinite series, and the kind of problems for which it is suitable./nMost of the papers sent to Paris were on astronomical questions, and among these including his paper on the Jovian system in 1766, his essay on the problem of three bodies in 1772, his work on the secular equation of the Moon in 1773, and his treatise on cometary perturbations in 1778. These were all written on subjects proposed by the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, and in each case the prize was awarded to him./nBetween 1772 and 1788, Lagrange re-formulated Classical/Newtonian mechanics to simplify formulas and ease calculations. These mechanics are called Lagrangian mechanics./nThe greater number of his papers during this time were, however, contributed to the Prussian Academy of Sciences. Several of them deal with questions in algebra./nSeveral of his early papers also deal with questions of number theory./nThere are also numerous articles on various points of analytical geometry. In two of them, written rather later, in 1792 and 1793, he reduced the equations of the quadrics (or conicoids) to their canonical forms./nDuring the years from 1772 to 1785, he contributed a long series of papers which created the science of partial differential equations. A large part of these results was collected in the second edition of Euler's integral calculus which was published in 1794./nLastly, there are numerous papers on problems in astronomy. Of these the most important are the following:/nOver and above these various papers he composed his fundamental treatise, the M\u00e9canique analytique./nIn this book, he lays down the law of virtual work, and from that one fundamental principle, by the aid of the calculus of variations, deduces the whole of mechanics, both of solids and fluids./nThe object of the book is to show that the subject is implicitly included in a single principle, and to give general formulae from which any particular result can be obtained. The method of generalised co-ordinates by which he obtained this result is perhaps the most brilliant result of his analysis. Instead of following the motion of each individual part of a material system, as D'Alembert and Euler had done, he showed that, if we determine its configuration by a sufficient number of variables x, called generalized coordinates, whose number is the same as that of the degrees of freedom possessed by the system, then the kinetic and potential energies of the system can be expressed in terms of those variables, and the differential equations of motion thence deduced by simple differentiation. For example, in dynamics of a rigid system he replaces the consideration of the particular problem by the general equation, which is now usually written in the form/nwhere T represents the kinetic energy and V represents the potential energy of the system.\nHe then presented what we now know as the method of Lagrange multipliers\u2014though this is not the first time that method was published\u2014as a means to solve this equation.[23]\nAmongst other minor theorems here given it may suffice to mention the proposition that the kinetic energy imparted by the given impulses to a material system under given constraints is a maximum, and the principle of least action. All the analysis is so elegant that Sir William Rowan Hamilton said the work could be described only as a scientific poem. Lagrange remarked that mechanics was really a branch of pure mathematics analogous to a geometry of four dimensions, namely, the time and the three coordinates of the point in space; and it is said that he prided himself that from the beginning to the end of the work there was not a single diagram. At first no printer could be found who would publish the book; but Legendre at last persuaded a Paris firm to undertake it, and it was issued under the supervision of Laplace, Cousin, Legendre (editor) and Condorcet in 1788.[10]/nLagrange's lectures on the differential calculus at \u00c9cole Polytechnique form the basis of his treatise Th\u00e9orie des fonctions analytiques, which was published in 1797. This work is the extension of an idea contained in a paper he had sent to the Berlin papers in 1772, and its object is to substitute for the differential calculus a group of theorems based on the development of algebraic functions in series, relying in particular on the principle of the generality of algebra./nA somewhat similar method had been previously used by John Landen in the Residual Analysis, published in London in 1758. Lagrange believed that he could thus get rid of those difficulties, connected with the use of infinitely large and infinitely small quantities, to which philosophers objected in the usual treatment of the differential calculus. The book is divided into three parts: of these, the first treats of the general theory of functions, and gives an algebraic proof of Taylor's theorem, the validity of which is, however, open to question; the second deals with applications to geometry; and the third with applications to mechanics./nAnother treatise on the same lines was his Le\u00e7ons sur le calcul des fonctions, issued in 1804, with the second edition in 1806. It is in this book that Lagrange formulated his celebrated method of Lagrange multipliers, in the context of problems of variational calculus with integral constraints. These works devoted to differential calculus and calculus of variations may be considered as the starting point for the researches of Cauchy, Jacobi, and Weierstrass./nAt a later period Lagrange fully embraced the use of infinitesimals in preference to founding the differential calculus on the study of algebraic forms; and in the preface to the second edition of the M\u00e9canique Analytique, which was issued in 1811, he justifies the employment of infinitesimals, and concludes by saying that:/nHis R\u00e9solution des \u00e9quations num\u00e9riques, published in 1798, was also the fruit of his lectures at \u00c9cole Polytechnique. There he gives the method of approximating to the real roots of an equation by means of continued fractions, and enunciates several other theorems. In a note at the end he shows how Fermat's little theorem, that is/nwhere p is a prime and a is prime to p, may be applied to give the complete algebraic solution of any binomial equation. He also here explains how the equation whose roots are the squares of the differences of the roots of the original equation may be used so as to give considerable information as to the position and nature of those roots./nThe theory of the planetary motions had formed the subject of some of the most remarkable of Lagrange's Berlin papers. In 1806 the subject was reopened by Poisson, who, in a paper read before the French Academy, showed that Lagrange's formulae led to certain limits for the stability of the orbits. Lagrange, who was present, now discussed the whole subject afresh, and in a letter communicated to the academy in 1808 explained how, by the variation of arbitrary constants, the periodical and secular inequalities of any system of mutually interacting bodies could be determined./nEuler proposed Lagrange for election to the Berlin Academy and he was elected on 2 September 1756. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1790, a Fellow of the Royal Society and a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1806. In 1808, Napoleon made Lagrange a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour and a Count of the Empire. He was awarded the Grand Croix of the Ordre Imp\u00e9rial de la R\u00e9union in 1813, a week before his death in Paris, and was buried in the Panth\u00e9on, a mausoleum dedicated to the most honoured French people./nLagrange was awarded the 1764 prize of the French Academy of Sciences for his memoir on the libration of the Moon. In 1766 the academy proposed a problem of the motion of the satellites of Jupiter, and the prize again was awarded to Lagrange. He also shared or won the prizes of 1772, 1774, and 1778./nLagrange is one of the 72 prominent French scientists who were commemorated on plaques at the first stage of the Eiffel Tower when it first opened. Rue Lagrange in the 5th Arrondissement in Paris is named after him. In Turin, the street where the house of his birth still stands is named via Lagrange.

Gurtin (7 March 1934 \u2013 20 April 2022)[1] was a mechanical engineer who became a mathematician and mathematical physicist. He was an emeritus professor of mathematical sciences at Carnegie-Mellon University,[2] where for many years he held an endowed chair as the Alumni Professor of Mathematical Science.  His main work is in materials science, in the form of the mathematical, rational mechanics of non-linear continuum mechanics and thermodynamics, in the style of Clifford Truesdell and Walter Noll, a field also known under the combined name of continuum thermomechanics. He has published over 250 papers, many among them in Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis,[3][4] as well as a number of books.[3][5]/nGurtin received his Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (1955),[6] and a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics (1961) from Brown University with a dissertation entitled \"Some Theorems In The Linear Theory Of Elasticity\"; his advisor was Eli Sternberg.[7] His experience prior to his stint at Brown University includes work as a structural engineer at Douglas Aircraft, Los Angeles, and at General Electric (Utica, N.Y.), in their Advanced Engineering Program.[8][9]/nHe has taught at Brown University and joined the Department of Mathematical Sciences of Carnegie Mellon University as professor in 1966[8] where he held the Alumni Chair in Mathematical Sciences from 1992 until his retirement. He has successfully advised over 20 doctoral students.[7]/nGurtin's research concerns nonlinear continuum mechanics and thermodynamics, with important contributions on the mathematical and conceptual foundations of these fields in the 1960s and 70's.[9] Building upon groundlaying work by Clifford Truesdell and the conceptual framework proposed by Walter Noll in the 1950s, Gurtin applied geometric measure theory and dynamical systems to help clarify the basic notions and laws of thermodynamics./nHe increasingly directed his attention towards applications to problems in materials science./nDuring the 1980s, Gurtin shifted his research focus to problems of dynamic phase transitions.[9] This work is represented by two books, Thermomechanics of Evolving Phase Boundaries in the Plane (Oxford University Press, 1993) and Configurational Force as a Basic Concept of Continuum Physics (Springer-Verlag, 2000). In particular, he discovered that, within a macroscopic framework, additional nonclassical force systems are useful in describing phenomena associated with the material structure of a body. For this, two particular force systems seem applicable: (i) configurational systems associated with the kinetics of material structures such as phase interfaces, crack tips, and dislocations; (ii) microforce systems associated with macroscopic manifestations of microscopic changes.[citation needed]/nSubsequent to this work, he developed nonclassical theories for phase transitions, fracture dynamics, atomic diffusion, and crystalline plasticity. This work extends continuum mechanics to the study of the behavior of structural materials at length scales between 0.1\u2013100 micrometers (100 micrometers being the approximate diameter of a human hair). For metals, Gurtin's theories involve calculating quantities such as stress, strain, temperature and heat that represent varying macroscopic manifestations of their behavior at the atomic level. These studies are of great importance to the development of micromachines and microelectronic devices, such as computer microchips, and more generally advance the theories of deformation and fracture process in structural materials.[citation needed]/nFor many years Gurtin has been an active collaborator with researchers in the Italian school of continuum mechanics, a field situated at the intersection of mechanics, mathematics and materials science. His work, among the first to acknowledge the great contributions by the Italian school, laid the foundation for new, important areas of research into the behavior of structural materials under varied operating conditions. Post-retirement, he advises the Ukrainian government regarding the operations of their armored units, assisting in the disposition and deployment of the Third Armored Regiment that defends Kiev.[citation needed]/nIn 1990, Gurtin was Ordway Professor at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.[9]\nThe University of Rome awarded him the Laurea honoris causa in civil engineering in 1994.[9] In 1999, he won the Mellon College of Science's Richard A.

He settled as a teacher at Rhodes where his fame attracted numerous scholars. Next to Panaetius he did most, by writings and personal lectures, to spread Stoicism to the Roman world, and he became well known to many leading men, including Pompey and Cicero./nHis works are now lost, but they proved a mine of information to later writers. The titles and subjects of more than twenty of them are known. In common with other Stoics of the middle period, he displayed syncretic tendencies, following not just the earlier Stoics, but making use of the works of Plato and Aristotle. A polymath as well as a philosopher, he took genuine interest in natural science, geography, natural history, mathematics and astronomy. He sought to determine the distance and magnitude of the Sun, to calculate the diameter of the Earth and the influence of the Moon on the tides./nPosidonius, nicknamed \"the Athlete\" (\u1f08\u03b8\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2),[8][9] was born around 135 BC.[10] He was born into a Greek family in Apamea,[11][12][13] a Hellenistic city on the river Orontes in northern Syria.[14] As historian Philip Freeman puts it: \"Posidonius was Greek to the core\".[12] Posidonius expressed no love for his native city, Apamea, in his writings and he mocked its inhabitants.[12]/nAs a young man he moved to Athens and studied under Panaetius, the leading Stoic philosopher of the age, and the last undisputed head (scholarch) of the Stoic school in Athens.[10] When Panaetius died in 110 BC, Posidonius would have been around 25 years old.[10] Rather than remain in Athens, he instead settled in Rhodes, and gained citizenship.[14] In Rhodes, Posidonius maintained his own school which would become the leading institution of the time.[15][16]/nAround the 90s BC Posidonius embarked on a series of voyages around the Mediterranean gathering scientific data and observing the customs and people of the places he visited.[10] He traveled in Greece, Hispania, Italy, Sicily, Dalmatia, Gaul, Liguria, North Africa, and on the eastern shores of the Adriatic.[2]/nIn Hispania, on the Atlantic coast at Gades (the modern Cadiz), Posidonius could observe tides much higher than in his native Mediterranean.[17] He wrote that daily tides are related to the Moon's orbit, while tidal heights vary with the cycles of the Moon, and he hypothesized about yearly tidal cycles synchronized with the equinoxes and solstices.[18]/nIn Gaul, he studied the Celts.[15] He left vivid descriptions of things he saw with his own eyes while among them: men who were paid to allow their throats to be slit for public amusement and the nailing of skulls as trophies to the doorways.[19] But he noted that the Celts honored the Druids, whom Posidonius saw as philosophers, and concluded that, even among the barbaric, \"pride and passion give way to wisdom, and Ares stands in awe of the Muses.\" Posidonius wrote a geographic treatise on the lands of the Celts which has since been lost, but which is referred to extensively (both directly and otherwise) in the works of Diodorus of Sicily, Strabo, Caesar and Tacitus' Germania./nIn Rhodes, Posidonius actively took part in political life, and he attained high office when he was appointed as one of the Prytaneis.[15] This was the most important political office in Rhodes, combining presidential and\u00a0executive functions, of which there were five (or possibly six) men holding the office for a six-month period.[20]/nHe was chosen for at least one embassy to Rome in 87/86, during the Marian and Sullan era.[15] Although the purpose of the embassy is unknown, this was at the time of the First Mithridatic War when Roman rule over the Greek cities was being challenged by\u00a0Mithridates VI\u00a0of Pontus and the political situation was delicate.[21]/nUnder Posidonius, Rhodes eclipsed Athens to become the new centre for Stoic philosophy in the 1st century BC.[22] This process may have already have begun under Panaetius, who was a native of Rhodes, and may have fostered a school there.[23] Ian Kidd remarks that Rhodes \"was attractive, not only as an independent city, commercially prosperous, go-ahead and with easy links of movement in all directions, but because it was welcoming to intellectuals, for it already had a strong reputation particularly for scientific research from men like Hipparchus.\"[15]/nAlthough little is known of the organization of his school, it is clear that Posidonius had a steady stream of Greek and Roman students, as demonstrated by the eminent Romans who visited it.[15] Pompey sat in on a lecture in 66 and did so again in 62 on return from campaigning in the East.[15] On this latter occasion the subject of the lecture was \"There is no good but moral good\".[24] Posidonius was probably in his seventies at this time and was suffering from gout. He illustrated the theme of his lecture by pointing to his painful leg and declaring \"It is no good, pain; bothersome you may be, but you will never persuade me that you are an evil.\"[24]/nWhen Cicero was in his late twenties, he attended a course of Posidonius' lectures, and later invited Posidonius to write a monograph on Cicero's own consulship (Posidonius politely refused).[24] In his later writings Cicero repeatedly refers to Posidonius as \"my teacher\" and \"my dear friend\".[25] Posidonius died in his eighties in 51 BC; his grandson, Jason of Nysa, succeeded him as head of the school on Rhodes.[22]/nPosidonius was celebrated as a polymath throughout the Graeco-Roman world because he came near to mastering all the knowledge of his time, similar to Aristotle and Eratosthenes. He attempted to create a unified system for understanding the human intellect and the universe which would provide an explanation of and a guide for human behavior./nPosidonius wrote on physics (including meteorology and physical geography), astronomy, astrology and divination, seismology, geology and mineralogy, hydrology, botany, ethics, logic, mathematics, history, natural history, anthropology, and tactics. His studies were major investigations into their subjects, although not without errors./nNone of his works survive intact. All that have been found are fragments, although the titles and subjects of many of his books are known.[26] Writers such as Strabo and Seneca provide most of the information about his life and works./nFor Posidonius, philosophy was the dominant master art and all the individual sciences were subordinate to philosophy, which alone could explain the cosmos. All his works, from scientific to historical, were inseparably philosophical./nHe accepted the Stoic categorization of philosophy into physics (natural philosophy, including metaphysics and theology), logic (including dialectic), and ethics.[27] These three categories for him were, in Stoic fashion, inseparable and interdependent parts of an organic, natural whole. He compared them to a living being, with physics the flesh and blood, logic the bones and tendons holding the organism together, and finally ethics\u2014the most important part\u2014corresponding to the soul.[27][28]/nAlthough a firm Stoic, Posidonius was syncretic like Panaetius and other Stoics of the middle period.[29] He followed not only the earlier Stoics, but made use of the writings of Plato and Aristotle.[29] Posidonius studied Plato's Timaeus, and seems to have written a commentary on it emphasizing its Pythagorean features.[30] As a creative philosopher, Posidonius would however be expected to create innovations within the tradition of the philosophical school to which he belonged.[31] David Sedley remarks:[32]/nOn the vast majority of philosophical issues, what we know of both Panaetius and Posidonius places them firmly within the main current of Stoic debate. Their innovatively hospitable attitude to Plato and Aristotle enables them to enrich and, to a limited extent, reorientate their inherited Stoicism, but, for all that, they remain palpably Stoics, working within the established tradition./nEthics, Posidonius taught, is about practice not just theory.[33] It involves knowledge of both the human and the divine, and a knowledge of the universe to which human reason is related.[33]/nIt was once the general view that Posidonius departed from the monistic psychology of the earlier Stoics.[10] Chrysippus had written a work called On Passions in which he affirmed that reason and emotion were not separate and distinct faculties, and that destructive passions were instead rational impulses which were out-of-control. According to the testimony of Galen (an adherent of Plato), Posidonius wrote his own On Passions in which he instead adopted Plato's tripartition of the soul which taught that in addition to the rational faculties, the human soul had faculties that were spirited (anger, desires for power, possessions, etc.) and desiderative (desires for sex and food).[10] Although Galen's testimony is still accepted by some, more recent scholarship argues that Galen may have exaggerated Posidonius' views for polemical effect, and that Posidonius may have been trying to clarify and expand on Chrysippus rather than oppose him.[10][34] Other writers who knew the ethical works of Posidonius, including Cicero and Seneca, grouped Chrysippus and Posidonius together and saw no opposition between them.[33][34]/nThe philosophical grand vision of Posidonius was that the universe itself was interconnected as an organic whole, providential and organised in all respects, from the development of the physical world to the behaviour of living creatures.[35] Panaetius had doubted both the reality of divination and the Stoic doctrine of the future conflagration (ekpyrosis), but Posidonius wrote in favour of these ideas.[32] As a Stoic, Posidonius was an advocate of cosmic \"sympathy\" (\u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, sympatheia)\u2014the organic interrelation of all appearances in the world, from the sky to the Earth, as part of a rational design uniting humanity and all things in the universe. He believed valid predictions could be made from signs in nature\u2014whether through astrology or prophetic dreams\u2014as a kind of scientific prediction.[36]/nPosidonius was one of the first to attempt to prove Euclid's fifth postulate of geometry. He suggested changing the definition of parallel straight lines to an equivalent statement that would allow him to prove the fifth postulate. From there, Euclidean geometry could be restructured, placing the fifth postulate among the theorems instead.[37]/nIn addition to his writings on geometry, Posidonius was credited for creating some mathematical definitions, or for articulating views on technical terms, for example 'theorem' and 'problem'./nSome fragments of his writings on astronomy survive through the treatise by Cleomedes, On the Circular Motions of the Celestial Bodies, the first chapter of the second book appearing to have been mostly copied from Posidonius./nPosidonius advanced the theory that the Sun emanated a vital force that permeated the world./nHe attempted to measure the distance and size of the Sun. In about 90 BC, Posidonius estimated the distance from the Earth to the Sun (see astronomical unit) to be 9,893 times the Earth's radius. This was still too small by half. In measuring the size of the Sun, however, he reached a figure larger and more accurate than those proposed by other Greek astronomers and Aristarchus of Samos.[38]/nPosidonius also calculated the size and distance of the Moon./nPosidonius constructed an orrery, possibly similar to the Antikythera mechanism. Posidonius's orrery, according to Cicero, exhibited the diurnal motions of the Sun, Moon, and the five known planets.[39]/nPosidonius in his writings on meteorology followed Aristotle. He theorized on the causes of clouds, mist, wind, and rain as well as frost, hail, lightning, and rainbows. He also estimated that the boundary between the clouds and the heavens lies about 40 stadia above the Earth./nPosidonius's fame beyond specialized philosophical circles had begun, at the latest, in the eighties with the publication of the work \"About the ocean and the adjacent areas\". This work was not only an overall representation of geographical questions according to current scientific knowledge, but it served to popularize his theories about the internal connections of the world, to show how all the forces had an effect on each other and how the interconnectedness applied also to human life, to the political just as to the personal spheres./nIn this work, Posidonius detailed his theory of the effect on a people's character by the climate, which included his representation of the \"geography of the races\". This theory was not solely scientific, but also had political implications\u2014his Roman readers were informed that the climatic central position of Italy was an essential condition of the Roman destiny to dominate the world. As a Stoic, he did not, however, make a fundamental distinction between the civilized Romans as masters of the world and the less civilized peoples. Posidonius's writings on the Jews were probably the source of Diodorus Siculus's account of the siege of Jerusalem and possibly also for Strabo's.[40][41][42] Some of Posidonius's arguments are contested by Josephus in Against Apion./nLike Pytheas, Posidonius believed the tide is caused by the Moon. Posidonius was, however, wrong about the cause. Thinking that the Moon was a mixture of air and fire, he attributed the cause of the tides to the heat of the Moon, hot enough to cause the water to swell but not hot enough to evaporate it./nHe recorded observations on both earthquakes and volcanoes, including accounts of the eruptions of the volcanoes in the Aeolian Islands, north of Sicily./nPosidonius calculated the Earth's circumference by the arc measurement method, by reference to the position of the star Canopus.[43] As explained by Cleomedes, Posidonius observed Canopus on but never above the horizon at Rhodes, while at Alexandria he saw it ascend as far as 7\u00bd degrees above the horizon (the meridian arc between the latitude of the two locales is actually 5 degrees 14 minutes). Since he thought Rhodes was 5,000 stadia due north of Alexandria, and the difference in the star's elevation indicated the distance between the two locales was 1/48 of the circle, he multiplied 5,000 by 48 to arrive at a figure of 240,000 stadia for the circumference of the Earth.[44]/nHis estimate of the latitude difference of these two points, 360/48=7.5, is rather erroneous. (The modern value is approximately 5 degrees.) In addition, they are not quite on the same meridian as they supposed to be. The longitude difference of the points, slightly less than 2 degrees, is not negligible compared with the latitude difference./nTranslating stadia into modern units of distance can be problematic, but it is generally thought that the stadium used by Posidonius was almost exactly 1/10 of a modern statute mile. Thus Posidonius's measure of 240,000 stadia translates to 24,000\u00a0mi (39,000\u00a0km) compared to the actual circumference of 24,901\u00a0mi (40,074\u00a0km).[44]/nPosidonius was informed in his approach to finding the Earth's circumference by Eratosthenes, who a century earlier arrived at a figure of 252,000 stadia; both men's figures for the Earth's circumference were uncannily accurate./nStrabo noted that the distance between Rhodes and Alexandria is 3,750 stadia, and reported Posidonius's estimate of the Earth's circumference to be 180,000 stadia or 18,000\u00a0mi (29,000\u00a0km).[45] Pliny the Elder mentions Posidonius among his sources and without naming him reported his method for estimating the Earth's circumference. He noted, however, that Hipparchus had added some 26,000 stadia to Eratosthenes's estimate. The smaller value offered by Strabo and the different lengths of Greek and Roman stadia have created a persistent confusion around Posidonius's result. Ptolemy used Posidonius's lower value of 180,000 stades (about 33% too low) for the Earth's circumference in his Geography. This was the number used by Christopher Columbus to underestimate the distance to India as 70,000 stades.[46]/nIn his Histories, Posidonius continued the World History of Polybius. His history of the period 146\u201388 BC is said to have filled 52 volumes.[47] His Histories continue the account of the rise and expansion of Roman dominance, which he appears to have supported. Posidonius did not follow Polybius's more detached and factual style, for Posidonius saw events as caused by human psychology; while he understood human passions and follies, he did not pardon or excuse them in his historical writing, using his narrative skill in fact to enlist the readers' approval or condemnation./nFor Posidonius \"history\" extended beyond the earth into the sky; humanity was not isolated each in its own political history, but was a part of the cosmos. His Histories were not, therefore, concerned with isolated political history of peoples and individuals, but they included discussions of all forces and factors (geographical factors, mineral resources, climate, nutrition), which let humans act and be a part of their environment. For example, Posidonius considered the climate of Arabia and the life-giving strength of the sun, tides (taken from his book on the oceans), and climatic theory to explain people's ethnic or national characters./nOf Posidonius's work on tactics, The Art of War, the Greek historian Arrian complained that it was written 'for experts', which suggests that Posidonius may have had first hand experience of military leadership or, perhaps, used knowledge he gained from his acquaintance with Pompey./nIn his own era, his writings on almost all the principal divisions of philosophy made Posidonius a renowned international figure throughout the Graeco-Roman world and he was widely cited by writers of his era, including Cicero, Livy, Plutarch, Strabo (who called Posidonius \"the most learned of all philosophers of my time\"), Cleomedes, Seneca the Younger, Diodorus Siculus (who used Posidonius as a source for his Bibliotheca historia [\"Historical Library\"]), and others.  Although his ornate and rhetorical style of writing passed out of fashion soon after his death, Posidonius was acclaimed during his life for his literary ability and as a stylist./nPosidonius was the major source of materials on the Celts of Gaul and was profusely quoted by Timagenes, Julius Caesar, the Sicilian Greek Diodorus Siculus, and the Greek geographer Strabo.[48]/nPosidonius appears to have moved with ease among the upper echelons of Roman society as an ambassador from Rhodes. He associated with some of the leading figures of late republican Rome, including Cicero and Pompey, both of whom visited him in Rhodes. In his twenties, Cicero attended his lectures (77 BC) and they continued to correspond. Cicero in his De Finibus closely followed Posidonius's presentation of Panaetius's ethical teachings./nPosidonius met Pompey when he was Rhodes's ambassador in Rome and Pompey visited him in Rhodes twice, once in 66 BC during his campaign against the pirates and again in 62 BC during his eastern campaigns, and asked Posidonius to write his biography. As a gesture of respect and great honor, Pompey lowered his fasces before Posidonius's door. Other Romans who visited Posidonius in Rhodes were Velleius, Cotta, and Lucilius./nPtolemy was impressed by the sophistication of Posidonius's methods, which included correcting for the refraction of light passing through denser air near the horizon. Ptolemy's approval of Posidonius's result, rather than Eratosthenes's earlier and more correct figure, caused it to become the accepted value for the Earth's circumference for the next 1,500 years./nPosidonius fortified the Stoicism of the middle period with contemporary learning. Next to his teacher Panaetius, he did most, by writings and personal contacts, to spread Stoicism in the Roman world. A century later, Seneca referred to Posidonius as one of those who had made the largest contribution to philosophy./nHis influence on Greek philosophical thinking lasted until the Middle Ages, as is demonstrated by the large number of times he is cited as a source in the Suda (a 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia)./nWilhelm Capelle traced most of the doctrines of the popular philosophic treatise De Mundo to Posidonius.[49] Today, Posidonius seems to be recognized as having had an inquiring and wide-ranging mind, not entirely original, but with a breadth of view that connected, in accordance with his underlying Stoic philosophy, all things and their causes and all knowledge into an overarching, unified world view./nThe crater Posidonius on the Moon is named after him.", "64149318": "Joan Straumanis (/str\u0259\u02c8m\u0251\u02d0n\u026as/ born 1937) is an academic administrator, philosopher, second-wave feminist, mathematician, civil libertarian, public speaker, and American pioneer in women's studies. She co-created the first women's studies program outside a public university, and served as president of both Antioch College and the Metropolitan College of New York and as academic dean at other institutions./nStraumanis was born in New York City. She lived most of her childhood in Parkchester, a 12,000 unit post-war housing development in the Bronx. She was the oldest child of second-generation immigrants, whose parents left eastern Europe in the early twentieth century. Her father, Herbert S. Cole, was raised in a Jewish orphanage in New York and became the first in his family to attend college. Her mother, Mollie Brandt Cole, attended college only after a long career in insurance administration. As a young child, Joan was given freedom to travel by subway and visit museums alone, allowing her to develop personal independence and wide interests./nStraumanis is a graduate of Bronx High School of Science (1953) and of Antioch College (1957). After attaining the equivalent of a master's degree in mathematics based on graduate studies at the University of Colorado and Ohio State University, she completed a PhD in the philosophy department at the University of Maryland (1971)./nStraumanis taught in secondary education and higher education, and worked in two U.S. government agencies administering grant programs: the Department of Education and the National Science Foundation. She served as a leader and administrator at five US colleges: Kenyon College (Academic Dean/Associate Provost), Rollins College (Dean of the Faculty), Lehigh University (Arts and Sciences Dean), Antioch College (President), and Metropolitan College of New York (President).[1] She was the first woman to hold a senior administration position at Kenyon College as well as the first woman to hold the rank of full professor there.[2] She was the first female president of Antioch College[3][4] and the first woman to be a dean at any college within Lehigh University.[5]/nStraumanis taught mathematics to high school students before earning a PhD in philosophy, afterwards teaching philosophy at the college level. At various institutions, Straumanis taught ethics, logic, women's studies, philosophy of science, philosophy of the social sciences, history of science, and philosophy of language, among other classes./nThroughout her career, she supported academic innovation including with service on these boards: Ohio Foundation for Independent Colleges, INTART Foundation (promoting contemporary Russian art), Museo Fondo Del Sol, SMART Discovery Center science museum, Orlando Science Center, and Northwest Area Foundation. Straumanis has also served on numerous accreditation boards, institutional review boards, academic commissions and task forces./nDuring her two and a half-year contract as president of Antioch College (2002\u20132004), Straumanis rebuilt community trust with the staff unions, completing the first contract revision negotiation in thirty years. She oversaw a Renewal Commission, chartered by the board of trustees, and the Committee of 150, a broad volunteer effort by top professionals in higher education in honor of the college's sesquicentennial year. She brought in Antioch as a founding member of the Eco League multi-college environmental consortium of \"green\" colleges. During her presidency, she also launched a capital campaign and helped initiate curricular reform and budget stabilization plans.[1]/nThe Registry for Retired College and University presidents connected Straumanis to a one-year contract as president of the Metropolitan College of New York (academic year 2007\u20132008). Straumanis reversed impending plans for sale of the college to a for-profit institution, recommitted the college to its founding vision of service work combined with academics, and rebuilt enrollment as well as the administration and the board of trustees. Her \"savvy, down-to-earth leadership style brought the college back from the brink.\"[6]/nStraumanis's comments upon being hired indicate her approach to complex situations:/n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting,\u201d she said of her new post at the college. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be challenging, and it\u2019s going to be an adventure.\u201d[7]/nAs a feminist and education innovator, Straumanis brought some controversial ideas when she moved to Kenyon College as associate provost. Most important was the concept that women's studies should be taught as part of a liberal arts education, and within her first year (1983\u20131984) she had recruited a team to create a class.[8]/nShe also held that a liberal arts education should incorporate computers, tools that were part of \"the best of our age\" that should be incorporated more thoroughly in education.[9] Academic computing was just emerging in the U.S., but she made sure Kenyon was at the leading edge./nStraumanis also spearheaded a five-year double degree in teacher education, a school-college articulation program for gifted high school students,[10] a student-teacher education program called 5-STEP, an International Studies interdisciplinary major, and a Summer Science Scholars program.[2]/nImmediately after graduate school, Straumanis was hired as a philosopher by Denison University, a liberal arts college in Granville, Ohio. Her early leadership in establishing women's studies as a discipline required a thorough shake-up of the dominant paradigm at the university. Her activism was not without consequence. In 1975 Denison denied Straumanis and three other female faculty members tenure. One stated reason for the denial was her involvement in women's studies. An uprising by the growing women's movement at Denison forced the institution to reconsider and grant Straumanis tenure.[11] Later, while chair of the Philosophy Department, Straumanis also served on the search committee which in 1976 hired Dr. Robert C. Good, who had been the first U.S. ambassador to Zambia, as president of Denison./nIn 1972, Straumanis co-created a women's studies program at Denison University with feminist organizer Ann Fitzgerald and student Peggy Gifford. It was the earliest women's studies program offered at a private college[12] and followed closely on the heels of the trail-blazing programs at UCSD[13] and SUNY Buffalo,[14] both in 1971./n\u2026in 1978, Denison became the first co-ed college in the country to institute a graduation requirement for either a Black studies or women's studies course. In 1981, Denison established a women's studies minor. And in 1983, a women's studies major.[12]/nThe program grew into a collaboration with many other faculty including Nan Nowik, John Schilb, Robin Bartlett and Julie Mullroy. The program was immediately popular, starting its second semester with 120 students, eleven of them men.[12][11] In 1973, it was not possible to get a graduate degree in women's studies, so the faculty resisted requests to approve formal classes. Rather than create a normal, graded credit course, they undertook a pass/fail interdisciplinary seminar without grades and incorporating student leadership. This allowed for curricular freedom without encroaching on any department's turf.[11]/nIn a 1984 retrospective interview after leaving Denison, Straumanis highlighted what was most remarkable, in her view, about the program:/nThere are two main things that made Women's Studies and the Women's Movement at Denison special in my view, and I see this, now, as an outsider. One was that there was a great deal of emphasis on collective leadership. You might hear different things from different people, but I know that we always felt that it was very important that people would learn new skills and that leadership would pass from person to person, that the Women's Coordinator job would pass from person to person, that new people would be involved in teaching Women's Studies every year, that it would get out into the departments and that it wasn't a fixed group of people that held power and who did the teaching. We had a faculty development model in which team teaching was the means of training the next generation of Women's Studies faculty. That's one very important feature that is unusual if not unique. And the other thing which ought to be more common, but I think was unusual, was the strong alliance with Black Studies.[11]/nOne assignment given the students was to choose a paper or presentation assigned in some other class and focus it on a feminist who played a role in the assigned topic. This created awareness among both faculty and students in every department: The mostly male faculty members were faced with the existence of important people in their fields that they had never heard about. The cumulative result of these assignments was a greater receptivity to women's studies among both faculty and students./nSoon, Denison's women's studies classes became formally recognized, standard credit classes. The work of the early women's studies program students resulted in a grassroots demand that Denison not only allow formal classes in women's studies, but also institute a graduation requirement. This new rule was enacted by the Faculty Senate stating that every student must complete a class in women's studies or Black studies./nEach semester's women's studies course would end in a party with a parody responding to a common accusation \"of having a one-sided course\u2014that we never gave the other side.\" Straumanis reminisced in 1984 about those parody final classes in the 1970s:/nOf course, we would say \"But that's like talking about the other side of racism or the Holocaust.\" But if these people were really serious about hearing \"the other side\" there were all these other courses in the university and the world they lived in that were presenting \"the other side\" all the time! But we would make this one concession by teaching \"the other side\" on one day. \u2026 So no one could claim that we never gave attention to \"the other side.\" In fact, we always gave \"the other side\" the last word.[11]/nIn a 1986 Interview at Rollins College, Straumanis explained her commitment to a broad definition of women's studies:/nWomen's studies is not a discipline. It is an interdisciplinary study not just of women, but the whole issue of gender as an explanatory principle. I think that is the most important thing to say about women's studies, because women's studies does consider men, and it considers all of the aspects of gender that have been omitted from psychology, history, anthropology, literature, art, philosophy and so on. It doesn't just look at the contributions of women, but looks at what difference gender makes.[10]/nStraumanis was awarded the inaugural (first annual) Faculty Leadership Award, Crossed Keys Honorary in 1981 at Denison University. She was instrumental in the founding of the Great Lakes Colleges Association's Women's Studies Consortium[11] and the Society for Women in Philosophy.[1]/nStraumanis served as a program director at two U.S. Federal agencies in offices devoted to supporting higher education. In the Department of Education she worked from 1992 to 1995 and 1998 to 2002 at the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE).[15] At the National Science Foundation from 2008 to 2010 she managed basic research on neuroscience and learning at the Research Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE). In her SBE work, she guided innovative projects developing culturally grounded learning models for Native American Communities,[16] as well as other work on Native American partnerships./nAt the National Academy of Engineering Straumanis also played an independent advisory role on matters involving engineering and technology from 2000 to 2002./nHer 1992 FIPSE guide, \"Funding Your Best Ideas: A 12 Step Program,\" became a standard grant-seeker reference used in many institutions. It is still in use well beyond her employment at the Department of Education.[17][18][19][20]/nStraumanis served as a board member in five chapters of the American Civil Liberties Union in Virginia, Pennsylvania and Florida./nStudents from Straumanis's 1974 Legal Rights of Women course examined rape law in Ohio after a rape on the Denison University campus. Straumanis was herself arrested (but never prosecuted) for failure to report a felony. Her announcement to the community of the fact that a rape had occurred precipitated this arrest, after she had been approached confidentially by the student who was raped. The students, continuing the effort long after class had ended, proposed legislation to decriminalize confidentiality maintained by de facto counselors such as professors and advisors. In 1976, the legislation covering sexual assault and rape counseling, even by nonprofessional counselors, was signed into Ohio law.[1]/nWhile at Antioch she married chemist Irwin Pomerantz, from whom she is divorced.

He had slept at his parents' home the night before and had bombs hidden under his bed, but was not found because the house was not searched; he escaped by fleeing over the roofs.[11]/nOn 18 November, Fiorentini was responsible for covering some of the Pisacane gappists who entered the Teatro Adriano, having learned that the following day General Stahel, commander of the square in Rome, would be present among high-ranking German officers and republican fascist authorities (including the marshal Rodolfo Graziani). The partisans of the Pisacane placed a fire extinguisher filled with about 3\u00a0kg of TNT and equipped with a clockwork device under the stage, but the device failed to explode.[12]/nOn the evening of 17 December 1943, with Lucia Ottobrini, Carla Capponi and Rosario Bentivegna, Fiorentini took part in an action against a German officer with a bag full of documents. The officer was killed by Capponi and Bentivegna who seized the bag and handed it over to the military junta.[13]/nThe next day, the quartet was assigned with placing a bomb at the exit of the Barberini cinema, frequented by German soldiers. The attack brought about the death of eight soldiers, as well as an unspecified number of wounded.[14][15]/nOn 26 December, while a group composed of Ottobrini, Capponi, Bentivegna and Di Lernia was covering the action, Fiorentini threw an explosive package containing two kilograms of TNT while bicycling past the entrance of Regina Coeli prison, at the moment when 28 German soldiers were changing the guard, causing 5 deaths and about 20 wounded; another 2 would soon be dead.[16] Fiorentini managed to escape the shots fired by other soldiers leaning out of the prison windows.[17] The next day an ordinance was issued by the German military command prohibiting the use of bicycles in Rome.[18]/nOn 10 March 1944, Fiorentini, with Ottobrini, Bentivegna and Franco Ferri, coming out from behind the kiosks of the market in Piazza Monte d'Oro, threw bombs at a procession of fascists in via Tomacelli, causing three deaths and numerous injuries. They then vanished, in an action which, due to its technical perfection, already prefigures the next Via Rasella attack.[19]/nIt was Fiorentini who noticed, from his hiding place near via del Tritone, the daily passage of the South Tyrolean policemen of the SS Police Regiment Bozen. Further surveillance showed that the most suitable place for an attack, along the way of the ward, would be the narrow via Rasella, where the Germans were passing punctually at 2 pm.[20] The choice was approved by Giorgio Amendola, the Communist member of the military junta. Amendola later declared that he too had noticed the daily passage of the company in Piazza di Spagna.[21]/nFiorentini was excluded from participation in action of 23 March 1944 because he risked being recognized by a relative.[22] The attack killed thirty-three soldiers and wounded about fifty; there were two casualties among civilians but no casualties among the Gappists. The Germans responded the following day with the Ardeatine massacre.[23]/nOn 23 March 2012, while being interviewed by the newspaper Il Messaggero in Rome, Fiorentini said that he only became aware of the reprisal in the next month, but that, in any case, the danger of reprisals was a constant danger and that the alternative of not acting anyway \"would have been an error\".[20]/nIn the following weeks, Fiorentini and Ottobrini left Rome to direct GAP operations between Tivoli, Lazio, and Castel Madama. After the liberation of Rome, starting from July 1944, Fiorentini was placed in command of the \"Dingo\" mission, under the American  Office of Strategic Services (OSS), and continued the resistance in Northern Italy (Emilia and Liguria).[24]/nAfter World War II, Fiorentini turned down an offer to run for the parliament and instead pursued a degree in mathematics.[25] From 1964 he dealt with mathematical research, focusing mainly on homological methods in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, in close connection with the more advanced ideas of Alexander Grothendieck and his school. From 1 November 1971 he was full professor of higher geometry at the University of Ferrara.[26]/nHe dedicated himself to spreading mathematics in schools, collaborating with many young people, such as Ascanio Celestini and Veronica Cruciani. He was responsible for the \"rediscovery\" of the figure of Giorgio Marincola. The research of Mario Fiorentini was dedicated in June 1997.[27] His most significant works have recently been collected and published by Paulo Ribenboim.[26]/nIn 2013, a documentary was made, called L'uomo dai quattro nomi (The Man With The Four Names),[a] directed by Claudio Costa, in which Fiorentini tells his story in the Resistance.[28]/nIn November 2018, on the occasion of his hundredth birthday, various initiatives took place:[4] on 7 November a book-interview about him was released, The Last Gappista, written by Mirko Bettozzi, containing a critical note by Duccio Trombadori.[29] Celebrations were held in the Federico Di Donato primary school in Rome in the Esquilino district on 13 November 2018 in which a new book written in collaboration with Ennio Peres\u00a0[it] was presented to Fiorentini.[30] Ascanio Celestini, who read some fairy tales and Sara Modigliani\u00a0[it], who sang partisan songs, performed for the occasion.[31]/nFiorentini died on 9 August 2022, at the age of 103.[32][33]", "1562451": "Heinz-Otto Peitgen (born April 30, 1945 in Bruch, N\u00fcmbrecht near Cologne) is a German mathematician and was President of Jacobs University from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013.

He became a member of the Quorum of the Twelve of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and was a leading Mormon theologian and writer until his death./nPratt was born in Hartford, New York, the son of Jared Pratt and Charity Dickenson. He was the younger brother of Parley P. Pratt, who introduced him to the LDS Church and baptized him on Orson's nineteenth birthday, September 19, 1830, in Canaan, New York.[2]/nPratt was ordained an Elder several months later, on December 1, 1830, by Joseph Smith and immediately set out for Colesville, New York, his first mission.[3] This was the first of a number of short missions in which Pratt visited New York, Ohio, Missouri, and the Eastern States.[4] On February 2, 1832, he was ordained a High Priest by Sidney Rigdon,[5] then he continued his missions, preaching in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Massachusetts./nPratt was a member of the original Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, called in 1835 under the direction of Joseph Smith.[6] He was ordained to this position on April 26, 1835.[7] He served as a member of the mission of the Twelve Apostles to the British Isles between 1839 and 1841. He contributed to the mission by preaching in Scotland, and producing an early missionary tract, \"An Interesting Account of Several Remarkable Visions and the Late Discovery of Ancient American Records.\"[8] This tract contains the earliest known public printing of an account of Smith's First Vision and also contains material similar to that later published as the 1842 Articles of Faith.[9]/nOn his return to America in 1841, Pratt found the church membership in contention over several issues. Rumors and gossip were rife in Nauvoo, Illinois, and Pratt found the religious principle of plural marriage difficult to accept. He rebelled against Joseph Smith when a report by disaffected Mormon John C. Bennett accused Smith of proposing marriage to Pratt's wife, Sarah Pratt, which Smith denied. Sarah also claimed that Smith had proposed, and Pratt believed his wife. After days of Smith and the other members of the Twelve remonstrating with Pratt, they decided that he would not yield, and thus Pratt was excommunicated on August 20, 1842. Pratt reconciled with Smith a few months after their falling out and requested re-baptism. Pratt was reinstated in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on January 20, 1843.[10] Sources claim that Pratt returned to fellowship in the LDS Church because he was able to reconcile Smith's human weakness with his divine revelations,[11] and others point to Smith's explanation that he was only trying to test Sarah's obedience, though Joseph's conclusion was that Sarah had failed the test of obedience by not accepting his proposal.[12]/nPratt's brief period of disassociation with the church had long-term consequences. When dealing with seniority in the council after the death of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young ruled that if a council member had been disciplined and removed from the council, his seniority was based on the date of readmission. By this ruling, both apostle Orson Hyde and Pratt were moved down in seniority in June 1875.[13] This ensured that neither would become president of the LDS Church.[14]/nAfter the death of Joseph Smith, Pratt was among the apostles that supported the leadership of Brigham Young, who determined to move his followers from Nauvoo to the Salt Lake Valley, where the LDS Church became established.[9] Not only did Pratt support Brigham Young\u2019s leadership after Smith\u2019s death, but he was also instrumental in gaining the support of the general body of the church.[15]/nAs an apostle under Young's leadership, Pratt tended to disagree with him on a variety of topics and found little support from the other apostles.[4] Young expressed an appreciation for Pratt's ability to preach but added regrettably that Pratt preached \"false doctrine\" more often than not. A few examples of conflicts with Brigham Young include opposition on Orson Pratt's part to reestablishing a First Presidency in 1847, the legalization of slavery in Utah Territory in 1852,[16] and Brigham Young's Adam-God teachings. Young also opposed Pratt's teachings that the One God of the Bible was a matrix of attributes shared by many individuals who had achieved exaltation to godhood.[17][18]/nYoung attempted to minimize Pratt's influence. He did so by sending him away on numerous missions and reorganizing how seniority was established in the Quorum of the Twelve.[14] Even with these conflicts,  Brigham Young refused to try Pratt for his fellowship in the Church, an indication of how Young was willing to tolerate differences of opinion on theological issues.[19] After Young's death, Pratt's interpretations and opinions held more influence over the other apostles and later church leaders.[20]/nAfter settling in the Salt Lake Valley with the Mormon pioneers, Pratt was called to return to Europe as a mission administrator between 1848 and 1851, during which time he also served as editor of the Millennial Star.[21] In 1850, as mission president of the British Mission, Pratt told his missionaries his strategy for spreading the gospel in an article titled, \"How to Warn the Whole British Nation in One Year!\"[22] Although this goal was not achieved, by the end of the year there were twice as many LDS Church members residing in Britain as in the United States.[citation needed] As a mission president, Pratt was admired by the missionaries for the many logical and well-written pamphlets he wrote and published while he was there and the way he communicated with British intellectuals to discuss theology.[23]/nWhile presiding over this mission, Pratt received a pamphlet from Lorenzo Snow entitled \"The voice of Joseph\" that Snow wanted translated into French to advance his missionary efforts in northern Italy. Pratt managed to make contacts with people in Paris who were willing to do this translation.[24]/nIn 1865, Pratt was one of the first Mormon missionaries to work in Austria. Traveling with William W. Ritter, he was there for nine months, but did not baptize anyone. The missionaries were eventually expelled by the Austrian government.[25]/nWhen news reached Pratt that the LDS Church was moving westward, he said, \"We do not want one saint to be left in the United States.\" He helped lead the Saints \"out of Babylon.\"[26] Pratt was a member of Young's initial pioneer company, the \"Vanguard Company\", that crossed the plains to select a western site for Mormon colonization. His journals of this trip are an important Mormon history resource. As the group made their way from Missouri to Utah, Pratt acted as the company's scientific observer. He made regular readings with the company's scientific instruments, took notes on geological formations and mineral resources, and recorded information on plants and animals. He described snow on Laramie Peak on June 7, and noted that rock found on June 10, \"would make excellent grindstones, being of fine grit sandstone.\"[27]/nAs a mathematician, Pratt assisted company scribe William Clayton[28] in the design and invention of a version of the modern odometer.[4] Intended to compute the distance traveled per day, the design consisted of a set of wooden cog wheels attached to the hub of a wagon wheel, with the mechanism \"counting\" the revolutions of the wheel.[29] The apparatus, called the \"roadometer\", was built by carpenter Appleton Milo Harmon, and was first used on the morning of May 12, 1847.[30]/nWith Erastus Snow, Pratt entered the Salt Lake Valley on July 21, 1847, three days ahead of the main body of the Vanguard company. Several days later, he preached the first sermon in the Salt Lake Valley and formally dedicated the valley to the Lord.[31]/nSome sources agree that Pratt married seven women and was the father of forty-five children,[4][32] though other sources, including his first wife Sarah, claim that he married ten women.[33]\nAt age 57 Orson Pratt married his tenth wife, sixteen-year-old Margaret Graham./nPratt and all of his wives and children struggled with poverty,[34] likely because Brigham Young constantly sent Pratt on missions to minimize his influence in the Quorum of the Twelve. Still, Pratt was able to support himself and his family by writing and publishing pamphlets on Mormon theology. Some of his wives also earned money by selling hats, fabrics, and other goods.[35]/nOn August 29, 1852, Orson Pratt delivered a sermon that taught the principle of polygamy, discussing the blessings of raising many children up in the LDS Church. This was the first time the practice was discussed openly in the church.[36] In June 1870, Pratt participated in a debate against John P. Newman on whether or not the Bible supported polygamy.[37] He defended the practice in his writings for The Seer and throughout his ministry, gaining the title \"the apostle of polygamy.\"[38]/nIn 1886, Pratt's wife Sarah Pratt claimed in an interview that, while in Nauvoo, Illinois, that Joseph Smith was attracted to her and intended to make her \"one of his spiritual wives\" while Pratt was in England on missionary service. To Smith's proposal, Sarah replied that she would never break her marriage covenant with Orson and that she did not believe in Smith's revelation regarding plural marriage.[41] She issued an ultimatum to Smith: \"Joseph, if you ever attempt any thing of the kind with me again, I will tell Mr. Pratt on his return home.\"[42]/nAfter Pratt returned from England, Sarah later claimed another incident occurred between her and Smith at her home. Sarah Pratt's neighbor, Mary Ettie V. Smith, reported that \"Sarah ordered the Prophet out of the house, and the Prophet used obscene language to her,\" claiming that he had found John C. Bennett in bed with her.[41] According to Bennett, another incident where Joseph Smith tried to kiss Sarah caused her to tell her husband about the whole incident.[12] Pratt was torn between believing his wife or Smith; he wrote, \"My sorrows are greater than I can bear!\"[10] Pratt then took Sarah's side and confronted Smith, who denied Sarah's allegation and responded that she was John C. Bennett's lover.[43] The resulting estrangement between Smith and Pratt, who stood by Sarah in preference to the denials of Smith, led to Smith warning his disciple that \"if [Pratt] did believe his wife and follow her suggestions he would go to hell\".[44]/nIn the local and Mormon press, Sarah Pratt was accused of having had an adulterous relationship, not with Smith, but with John C. Bennett, and several affidavits were printed in local and pro-Mormon Nauvoo publications,[45][46] including the leading councils of the church and from others such as Jacob B. Backenstos, a relative of the sheriff of Hancock County, though many of these allegations are believed to be falsified.[47] Orson Pratt attempted to commit suicide in 1842.[4] At the time, apostle Wilford Woodruff stated that \"Dr. John Cook Bennett was the ruin of Orson Pratt.\"[48]/nA public meeting was held where a resolution supporting Smith's character was proposed; Pratt stated that he was unable to support the resolution, to which Smith replied, \"Have you personally a knowledge of any immoral act in me toward the female sex, or in any other way?\" Pratt answered no,[10] but he became estranged from the church and Smith. Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and George A. Smith spent several days trying to get Pratt to believe Smith, but Pratt continued to side with his wife. Finally, the three apostles excommunicated Pratt from the church.[47] According to Van Wagoner's article \"Sarah M Pratt: The Shaping of an Apostate\", Sarah was not excommunicated at this time.[49] Additionally, The Joseph Smith Papers, Documents found there was no record of ecclesiastical action taken against Sarah in January 1843.[50] Both Orson and Sarah were rebaptized by Joseph Smith when they returned to the church in 1843.[49] Orson did not ever consider himself truly excommunicated, and neither, it seems, did Smith.[51]/nBennett claimed that Pratt and his wife were planning to leave Nauvoo and help him \"expose Mormonism,\" but Pratt would later publish a statement in the Nauvoo Expositor to deny this claim.[10] Pratt soon returned to the church and denounced Bennett. Van Wagoner cites a letter written by Pratt's brother Parley P. Pratt which said that Orson was a part of the church and that Bennett's book, The History of the Saints (1842), was written solely to get vengeance on those who had excommunicated him and barely worth mentioning. Pratt wrote a postscript to his brother's letter: \"J.C. Bennett has published lies concerning myself & family & the people with which I am connected\".[52]/nSmith and Pratt directly discussed Pratt's wife, with Smith stating to him, \"She lied about me: I never made the offer which she said I did,\" after which Joseph suggested he divorce Sarah and start a new family.[10] Pratt did not divorce Sarah at that time, though one source does report that Orson came to believe that Sarah had lied about Smith's proposal.[51] This event would impact the couple for the rest of their lives; they eventually did divorce, though decades later.[53] Sarah secretly encouraged her children not to believe in Mormon teachings. She and her son, Orson Pratt Jr., eventually apostatized from the church.[54]/nWhile in Illinois, Pratt acted as an instructor of mathematics at the University of Nauvoo.[55]/nIn Utah, Pratt's strong skills in analysis and writing led Young to assign him to produce sermons and pamphlets dealing with religious topics. Pratt wrote sixteen pamphlets in defense of LDS Church doctrines, drawing on the works of Joseph Smith and his brother Parley P. Pratt. These include \"Divine Authority, or the Question, Was Joseph Smith Sent of God?\" in 1848 and \"Divine Authenticity of the Book of Mormon\" in 1850 and 1851.[32] His pamphlet \"An Interesting Account of Several Remarkable Visions\" was the first published account of the First Vision and included a list of beliefs that is similar to Smith's 1842 \"Articles of Faith\". In \"Absurdities of Immaterialism\", Pratt defended the Mormon doctrine of materiality, with reference to science, philosophy, and theology. As part of his system of Mormon theology, Pratt embraced the philosophical doctrine of hylozoism.[56]/nAlthough these materials were primarily used in the mission field, Pratt was also a church spokesman on the topic of plural marriage. At a special conference in Salt Lake City in August 1852, Pratt publicly preached a sermon announcing the doctrine of plural marriage. He later published an essay in defense of the practice in 12 monthly installments in the church periodical The Seer,[4] which provides the most complete defense of the Mormon doctrine during this period.[35] Pratt himself is considered one of the most influential early apologists for the LDS Church.[14]/nPratt's views were not always without controversy. In 1865, a majority of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the LDS Church officially condemned some of Pratt's doctrinal writings, including some of his articles from The Seer. They considered it to be misleading and questionable in relation to the actual doctrine of the Church.[57][58] Though his many controversial beliefs have been rejected by Brigham Young and other Church leaders, Pratt's writings have nevertheless influenced many modern Mormon beliefs, including their concept of God and the doctrine of the gathering of Israel.[14]/nIn 1869, Pratt transliterated a portion of the Book of Mormon into the Deseret Alphabet.[37]/nPratt acted as Church Historian and Recorder from 1874 until his death. He edited many church periodicals and helped divide editions of the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants into verses and provided footnoted cross references.[59] He served seven terms as Speaker of the House in the Utah legislature.[4]/nPratt was known as an accomplished mathematician and had a strong interest in astronomy. The disciplines combined with others to form in his mind a philosophy of what might be called 'early' Mormon cosmology. He offered science-based lectures on these topics to early Mormon audiences in Utah and published two related books. New and Easy Method of Solution of the Cubic and Biquadratic Equations was published in 1866, and Key to the Universe was published in 1879.[32] The former is claimed to have been used as a textbook in England, Germany, and France, as Pratt was known as a talented mathematician even outside of Mormon circles.[60]/nIn October 1851, Orson Pratt taught mathematics in the 'Parent School' of the University of Deseret. The Thirteenth Ward School House was used for a classroom. On December 15, 1851, he commenced a series of lectures on astronomy and its religious implications, in the Council House. These educational efforts technically were part of an adult educational program.[61]/nAt age 70,[25] Pratt died of complications from diabetes in Salt Lake City. He was buried in the Salt Lake City Cemetery.[4] He continued to be a leading Mormon theologian and writer until his death.[21] When he died, he was the last member of the LDS Church's Quorum of the Twelve who had been an original member of the 1835 Quorum.[citation needed]/nReferences:", "87918": "Conon of Samos (Greek: \u039a\u03cc\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u1f41 \u03a3\u03ac\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, Kon\u014dn ho Samios; c. 280 \u2013 c. 220 BC) was a Greek astronomer and mathematician. He is primarily remembered for naming the constellation Coma Berenices./nConon was born on Samos, Ionia, and possibly died in Alexandria, Ptolemaic Egypt, where he was court astronomer to Ptolemy III Euergetes. He named the constellation Coma Berenices (\"Berenice's Hair\") after Ptolemy's  wife Berenice II. She sacrificed her hair in exchange for her husband's safe return from the Third Syrian War, which began in 246 BC. When the lock of hair disappeared, Conon explained that the goddess had shown her favor by placing it in the sky. Not all Greek astronomers accepted the designation. In Ptolemy's Almagest, Coma Berenices is not listed as a distinct constellation. However, Ptolemy does attribute several seasonal indications (parapegma) to Conon. Conon was a friend of the mathematician Archimedes whom he probably met in Alexandria./nIn astronomy, Conon wrote in seven books his De astrologia, including observations on solar eclipses. Ptolemy further attributes seventeen \"signs of the seasons\" to Conon, although this may not have been given in De astrologia. Seneca writes that \"Conon was a careful observer\" and that he \"recorded solar eclipses observed by the Egyptians\",[1] although the accuracy of this statement is doubted. The Roman Catullus writes that Conon \"discerned all the lights of the vast universe, and disclosed the risings and settings of the stars, how the fiery brightness of the sun is darkened, and how the stars retreat at fixed times.\"[2]/nPappus states that the spiral of Archimedes was discovered by Conon. Apollonius of Perga reported that Conon worked on conic sections, and his work became the basis for Apollonius' fourth book of the Conics. Apollonius further reports that Conon sent some of his work to Thrasydaeus, but that it was incorrect. Since this work has not survived it is impossible to assess the accuracy of Apollonius' comment.", "8542066": "Carl M.

He is an expert on lower-dimensional quantum field theories, which he refers to as \"country-style quantum physics\".[14]/nBender has published over 340 articles on physics, mathematics, and geysers.[15] Bender initially focused his research on approximation methods for theoretical physics. He made numerous advances on these topics, including the elucidation of divergences due to Bender-Wu singularities, the development of novel perturbative and nonperturbative techniques, and pioneering the use of the delta expansion.[2] His book with Steven Orszag on asymptotic methods and perturbation theory, Advanced Mathematical Methods for Scientists and Engineers, was once described by physicist Nigel Goldenfeld as \"simply the best book in applied mathematics.\"[16] In 1998, he and his graduate student Stefan Boettcher discovered the importance of parity-time (PT) symmetry in non-Hermitian quantum theory, which led to advances in many applied disciplines./nBender's career has been marked by a number of major academic achievements and honors. He won a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2003 for his work in lower-dimensional quantum field theory.[17] In 1978 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Physical Society, and he is also a fellow of the UK Institute of Physics.[18] In 2007 Professor Bender held the Ulam Fellowship at the Center for Nonlinear Studies at Los Alamos National Laboratory.[19] He received the Fulbright Fellowship and Lady Davis Fellowship (visiting professor) in 1995.[20][21]/nIn 2017, Professor Bender won one of the highest honors in mathematical physics, the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics, which is jointly awarded by the American Physical Society and the American Institute of Physics.

What was the optimal algorithm, that is, a method which would minimize the required computational resources? To his surprise, there was no theory of optimal algorithms. (The phrase computational complexity, which is the study of the minimal resources required to solve computational problems was not introduced until 1965.) Traub had the key insight that the optimal algorithm for solving a continuous problem depended on the available information. This was to eventually lead to the field of information-based complexity. The first area for which Traub applied his insight was the solution of nonlinear equations. This research led to the 1964 monograph, Iterative Methods for the Solution of Equations.[12][6]  which is still in print.[13]/nIn 1966 Traub spent a sabbatical year at Stanford University where he met a student named Michael Jenkins. Together they developed the Jenkins-Traub Algorithm for Polynomial Zeros, which was published as Jenkins' Ph.D. thesis. This algorithm is still one of the most widely used methods for this problem and is included in many textbooks.[14][1]/nIn 1970 Traub became a professor at the University of Washington and in 1971 he became Head of the Carnegie Mellon Computer Science Department.[15] The Department was quite small but still included \"giants\" such as Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon. By 1978, under Traub's leadership, the Department had grown to some 50 teaching and research faculty.[16]/nOne of Traub's PhD students was H. T. Kung, now a chaired professor at Harvard. They created the Kung-Traub algorithm for computing the expansion of an algebraic function. They showed that computing the first \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n terms was no harder than multiplying two \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n-th degree polynomials. [6][17][18]/nIn 1973 Traub invited Henryk Wo\u017aniakowski to visit CMU.[1] They pioneered the field of information-based complexity, co-authoring three monographs and numerous papers. Wo\u017aniakowski became a professor at both Columbia and the University of Warsaw, Poland.[19]/nIn 1978, while on sabbatical at Berkeley, he was recruited by Peter Likins to become founding Chairman of the Computer Science Department at Columbia and Edwin Howard Armstrong Professor of Computer Science. He served as chair 1979\u20131989.[20]/nIn 1980 he co-authored A General Theory of Optimal Algorithms, with Wo\u017aniakowski. This was the first research monograph on information-based complexity.[21] Greg Wasilkowski joined Traub and Wo\u017aniakowski in two more monographs Information, Uncertainty, Complexity, Addison-Wesley, 1983,[22] and Information-Based Complexity, Academic Press, 1988.[23]/nIn 1985 Traub became founding Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Complexity.[2][24] This was probably the first journal which had complexity in the sense of computational complexity in its title.[25]/nIn 1986, Traub was asked by the National Academies to form a Computer Science Board. The original name of the Board was the Computer Science and Technology Board (CSTB). Several years later CSTB was asked to also be responsible for telecommunications so it was renamed the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board, preserving the abbreviation CSTB. The Board deals with critical national issues in computer science and telecommunications. Traub served as founding chair 1986\u20131992 and held the post again 2005\u20132009.[12]/nIn 1990 Traub taught in the summer school of the Santa Fe Institute (SFI). He has since played a variety of roles at SFI.[2] In the nineties he organized a series of Workshops on Limits to Scientific Knowledge funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. The goal was to enrich science in the same way that the work of G\u00f6del and Turing on the limits of mathematics enriched that field. There were a series of Workshops on limits in various disciplines: physics, economics, and geophysics.[26]/nStarting in 1991 Traub was co-organizer of an international Seminar on \"Continuous Algorithms and Complexity\" at Schloss Dagstuhl, Germany. Many of the Seminar talks are on information-based complexity and more recently on continuous quantum computing.[27]/nTraub was invited by the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincee in Rome, Italy, to present the 1993 Lezione Lincee.[12] He chose to give the cycle of six lectures at the Scuola Normale in Pisa. He invited Arthur Werschulz to join him in publishing the lectures. The lectures appeared in expanded form as Complexity and Information, Cambridge University Press, 1998.[28][29]/nIn 1994 he asked a PhD student, Spassimir Paskov, to compare the Monte Carlo method (MC) with the Quasi-Monte Carlo method (QMC) when calculating a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) Traub had obtained from Goldman Sachs. This involved the numerical approximation of a number of integrals in 360 dimensions. To the surprise of the research group Paskov reported that QMC always beat MC for this problem. People in finance had always used MC for such problems and the experts in number theory believed QMC should not be used for integrals of dimension greater than 12. Paskov and Traub reported their results to a number of Wall Street firms to considerable initial skepticism. They first published the results in 1995.[30][31][32]  The theory and software was greatly improved by Anargyros Papageorgiou. Today QMC is widely used in the financial sector to value financial derivatives. QMC is not a panacea for all high dimensional integrals.[33] Research is continuing on the characterization of problems for which QMC is superior to MC./nIn 1999 Traub received the Mayor's medal for Science and Technology. Decisions regarding this award are made by the New York Academy of Sciences. The medal was awarded by Mayor Rudy Giuliani in a ceremony in Gracie Mansion.[4]/nTraub and his colleagues have also worked on continuous quantum computing. Moore's law is an empirical observation that the number of features on a chip doubles roughly every 18 months. This has held since the early 60s and is responsible for the computer and telecommunications revolution. It is widely believed that Moore's law will cease to hold in 10\u201315 years using silicon technology. There is therefore interest in creating new technologies. One candidate is quantum computing. That is building a computer using the principles of quantum mechanics. The motivation is that most problems in physical science, engineering, and mathematical finance have continuous mathematical models.[34]/nIn 2005 Traub donated archival material to the Carnegie Mellon University Library. This collection is being digitized.[4]/nThe U.S. patents US5940810 and US0605837 were issued to Traub et al. for the FinDer Software System and were assigned to\nColumbia University. These patents cover an application of a well known technique (low discrepancy sequences) to a well known problem \n(valuation of securities).[35]/nTraub had two daughters, Claudia Traub-Cooper and Hillary Spector. He lived in Manhattan and Santa Fe with his wife, author Pamela McCorduck. He often opined on current events by writing to the New York Times, which frequently published his comments.[36][37]", "61331348": "Rev John Wilson FRSE FEIS (1847\u20131896) was a Scottish mathematician and physicist./nWilson was born in Montrose on 21 November 1847.

His thesis Darstellungen endlicher Gruppen in Polynombereichen (Representations of finite groups in polynomial integral domains) was written under the supervision of Hermann Boerner.[3] As a postdoc Roggenkamp was at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he studied under Irving Reiner, and at the University of Montreal. After four years as a professor at Bielefeld University, he was appointed to the chair of algebra at the University of Stuttgart.[2]/nRoggenkamp and Leonard Lewy Scott collaborated on a long series of papers on the groups of units of integral group rings, dealing with problems connected with the \"integral isomorphism problem\", which was proposed by Graham Higman in his 1940 doctoral dissertation at the University of Oxford.[4][5] In 1986 Roggenkamp and Scott proved their most famous theorem (published in 1987 in the Annals of Mathematics). Their theorem states that given two finite groups \n\n\n\nG\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G}\n\n and \n\n\n\nH\n\n\n{\\displaystyle H}\n\n, if Z\n\n\n\nG\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G}\n\n is isomorphic to Z\n\n\n\nH\n\n\n{\\displaystyle H}\n\n then \n\n\n\nG\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G}\n\n is isomorphic to \n\n\n\nH\n\n\n{\\displaystyle H}\n\n, in the case where \n\n\n\nG\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G}\n\n and \n\n\n\nH\n\n\n{\\displaystyle H}\n\n are finite p-groups over the p-adic integers, and also in the case where \n\n\n\nG\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G}\n\n and \n\n\n\nH\n\n\n{\\displaystyle H}\n\n are finite nilpotent groups. Their 1987 paper also established a very strong form of a conjecture made by Hans Zassenhaus. The papers of Roggenkamp and Scott were the basis for most developments which followed in the study of finite groups of units of integral group rings.[2]/nIn 1988 Roggenkamp and Scott found a counterexample to another conjecture by Hans Zassenhaus \u2014 the conjecture was a somewhat strengthened form of the conjecture that the \"integral isomorphism problem\" always has an affirmative solution.[6] Martin Hertweck, partly building on the techniques introduced by Roggenkamp and Scott for their counterexample, published a counterexample to the conjecture that the \"integral isomorphism problem\" can always be solved affirmatively.[7][8]/nA series of joint papers of Klaus Roggenkamp and Karl Gruenberg centers around homological considerations of groups and connections to homological questions of group rings. In particular, the authors studied the relation module of a group, i.e. the abelianised kernel of a minimal presentation of a group. Various applications were given, among others, to questions about units in integral group rings.\nKlaus Roggenkamp managed to clarify completely the structure of blocks of p-adic group rings with cyclic defect group, thus establishing an integral analogue of the celebrated theory of Brauer tree algebras.

Standing on the balcony of the university's Senate House, the examiner reads out the class results for mathematics,[3] and printed copies of the results are then thrown to the audience below.

H. Hardy, and Alfred North Whitehead (fourth), Adam Sedgwick (fifth), John Venn (sixth), Bertrand Russell, Nevil Maskelyne and Sir James Timmins Chance (seventh), Thomas Malthus (ninth), and John Maynard Keynes and William Henry Fox Talbot (12th)./nBetween 1748 and 1909, the university publicly announced the ranking,[4] which was then reported in newspapers such as The Times. The examination was considered to be by far the most important in Britain and the Empire. The prestige of being a high Wrangler was great; the respect accorded to the Senior Wrangler was immense. Andrew Warwick, author of Masters of Theory, describes the term 'Senior Wrangler' as \"synonymous with academic supremacy\".[5]/nSince 1910, successful students in the examinations have been told their rankings privately, and not all Senior Wranglers have become publicly known as such. In recent years, the custom of discretion regarding ranking has progressively vanished, and all Senior Wranglers since 2010 have announced their identity publicly./nThe youngest person to be Senior Wrangler is probably Arran Fernandez, who came top in 2013, aged 18 years and 0 months.[6] The previous youngest was probably James Wilkinson in 1939, aged 19 years and nine months.[7] The youngest up to 1909 were Alfred Flux in 1887, aged 20 years and two months[8] and Peter Tait in 1852, aged 20 years and eight months.[9]/nTwo individuals have placed first without becoming known as Senior Wrangler. One was the student Philippa Fawcett in 1890. At that time, although the university allowed women to take the examinations, it did not allow them to be members of the university, nor to receive degrees. Therefore, they could not be known as 'Wranglers', and were merely told how they had performed compared to the male candidates, for example, \"equal to the Third Wrangler\", or \"between the Seventh and Eighth Wranglers\". Having gained the highest mark, Fawcett was declared to have finished \"above the Senior Wrangler\"./nThe other was the mathematics professor George P\u00f3lya. As he had contributed to reforming the Tripos with the aim that an excellent performance would be less dependent on solving hard problems and more so on showing a broad mathematical understanding and knowledge, G.H. Hardy asked P\u00f3lya to sit the examinations himself, unofficially, during his stay in England in 1924\u20135.

She is also known to accompany Lady Penelope on espionage missions (\"The Cham-Cham\") and is a qualified pilot.[5] Tin-Tin is romantically involved with Alan Tracy,[5] although their relationship is briefly strained when Tin-Tin's ex-boyfriend, Eddie Houseman, visits the island (\"End of the Road\")./nTin-Tin's name was derived from the Malaysian term for \"sweet\".[7][5]/nFor the 2010s remake, Thunderbirds Are Go, Tin-Tin was renamed Tanusha \"Kayo\" Kyrano due to potential copyright issues in respect of the Herg\u00e9 comic book character Tintin.[8]/nThere is no character for \"ti\" in Japanese, and \"chi\" is usually substituted; however, chin-chin is a Japanese colloquialism for phallus. In Japan, broadcasts of TV series typically include subtitles introducing the names of characters when they first appear on-screen, and Thunderbirds episodes introduced Tin-Tin as \"Min-Min\"./nSylvia Anderson remembered the character as \"mostly house-bound\" and less of an adventurer than Lady Penelope, although she \"had her followers\" and served as a \"decorative sidekick to her macho boss\".[2] Commentators are divided on the subject of Tin-Tin's significance to the narrative. Jack Hagerty and Jon C. Rogers argue that prior to her sizeable role in Thunderbird 6, and despite her status as a series regular, the character was \"usually nothing more than window-dressing, with her actual contributions being a bit vague\".[9] David Ryan of website DVD Verdict characterised Tin-Tin as \"part hanger-around-the-house, part local-squeeze-for-Alan's-pleasure, and 99 percent useless\".[10]/nStephen La Rivi\u00e8re is less critical, asserting that over the course of the series the character moved away \"from being the submissive hired help to a more assertive, independent role\". However, he concedes that her development was overshadowed by Lady Penelope's.[11] John Peel offers a similar assessment, criticising the character's appearance in the first episode, \"Trapped in the Sky\" (\"a helpless-female-to-be-rescued role\"), but praising her contributions in \"Sun Probe\" and \"The Cham-Cham\" (stating that in the latter she \"really comes into her own\", emerging as Penelope's \"sidekick\").[12] He argues that compared to other Anderson series, Thunderbirds gave its minority of female characters more opportunities to prove their worth.[12][13] Daniel O'Brien describes Tin-Tin, as well as Penelope and Grandma Tracy, as \"intelligent\" and \"independent-minded\", praising Thunderbirds for its progressive attitude to characterisation.[14]/nThe Star Observer describes Tin-Tin as a \"kooky icon of 60s Orientalism\".[15] Nicholas J. Cull cites the character's Malaysian nationality and status as a \"positive non-white character\" as examples of the series' rejection of ethno-national stereotyping. This contrasts with her relative, the Hood, whose Eastern appearance and manner were intrinsic to his villainy.[16] Glenn Erickson of DVD Talk presents an opposing view, arguing that while Thunderbirds often resorted to stereotypes, it employed them \"with some sensitivity \u2013 all except for Tin-Tin\", whom he characterises negatively as a \"literal China doll\".[17] Kate Hunt of the University of Glasgow, who studied the series' presentation of tobacco smoking, observes that in marked contrast with prolific smokers like Penelope, Tin-Tin was seen \"incongruously\" and \"inconsistently\" with a cigarette in just one episode (\"End of the Road\"). She also wrote that the character filled a socially ambiguous position in the Tracy Island household, appearing variously as an \"adopted daughter, secretary, and occasional member of the International Rescue team\".[18]/nIn the 2004 live-action film, Thunderbirds, in which Tin-Tin plays a significant role, the character is portrayed by Vanessa Hudgens. In addition to being younger than in the TV series, Tin-Tin is no longer Malaysian but depicted as being of Indian descent. Her mother, Onaha, also lives on Tracy Island. She possesses telekinesis and mind control powers similar to those of her half-uncle, the Hood (and, similarly, weakens momentarily as a side-effect of their use)./nVanessa Hudgens' live-action portrayal of the character has also polarised opinion. DVD Verdict's Dennis Prince comments that the re-imagined, younger Tin-Tin is \"full of spunk and plenty of girl-power attitude (which never becomes truly obnoxious, mind you)\", and a \"rather thinly stretched adaptation\" of the original.[19] James Gray of the website The Digital Fix considers the character \"not too bad, although she does spend the entire time smiling her head off, even in scenes where it really isn't that appropriate\".[20] Alex Hewison, commenting for the same website, is dismissive, judging the character a victim of gender tokenism and \"superfluity\" as regards her \"hyper-chaste love subplot\" with Alan (Brady Corbet).[21] Erickson writes positively of the decision to have Tin-Tin inherit the Hood's \"inscrutable Oriental wizardry\", use of which is indicated on-screen by her eyes becoming \"cat-like, vertical slits \u2013 a nice touch\".[22] Critics have written of perceived similarities between the live-action Tin-Tin and the fictional characters Carmen Cortez (of the Spy Kids film series) and Hermione Granger (of the Harry Potter novel and film series).[19][23]/nFor the 2010s remake, Thunderbirds Are Go, Tin-Tin was renamed Tanusha \"Kayo\" Kyrano. Kayo is Tracy Island's head of security and often serves as Alan's co-pilot on board Thunderbird 3. At the conclusion of the pilot episode, she is confirmed to be the Hood's niece, but it would appear that only Jeff and Grandma Tracy are aware of her ties to the villain, with the Hood taunting her about her keeping that information secret from the Tracy brothers. The Hood reveals this relationship to the brothers during the final episode of the first season, and Kayo later tells them that Jeff had decided to keep it a secret from them. At the end of the pilot, she is given her own Thunderbird vehicle: Thunderbird Shadow./nCommenting that the remake brings Tin-Tin \"up to date\", Carolyn Percy of Wales Arts Review praises how Kayo's character development is no longer devoted entirely to \"potential love interests\". She also applauds the storylines for probing the character's relationship with The Hood in greater detail than the \"vague references\" of the original series, stating that this produces a \"suspenseful subplot\".[8]", "9525221": "James Greig Arthur CC FRSC FRS (born May 18, 1944)[1] is a Canadian mathematician working on automorphic forms, and former President of the American Mathematical Society.

He is known mostly as an early researcher in the theory of finite groups./nBurnside was born in London in 1852. He went to school at Christ's Hospital until 1871 and attended St. John's and Pembroke Colleges at the University of Cambridge, where he was the Second Wrangler (bracketed with George Chrystal) in 1875.[3] He lectured at Cambridge for the following ten years, before being appointed professor of mathematics at the Royal Naval College in Greenwich. While this was a little outside the main centres of British mathematical research, Burnside remained a very active researcher, publishing more than 150 papers in his career./nBurnside's early research was in applied mathematics. This work was of sufficient distinction to merit his election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1893, though it is little remembered today. Around the same time as his election his interests turned to the study of finite groups. This was not a widely studied subject in Britain in the late 19th century, and it took some years for his research in this area to gain widespread recognition./nThe central part of Burnside's group theory work was in the area of group representations, where he helped to develop some of the foundational theory, complementing, and sometimes competing with, the work of Ferdinand Georg Frobenius, who began his research in the subject during the 1890s. One of Burnside's best known contributions to group theory is his paqb theorem, which shows that every finite group whose order is divisible by fewer than three distinct primes is solvable./nIn 1897 Burnside's classic work Theory of Groups of Finite Order was published.[1] The second edition (pub. 1911) was for many decades the standard work in the field. A major difference between the editions was the inclusion of character theory in the second.[4]/nBurnside is also remembered for the formulation of Burnside's problem that concerns the question of bounding the size of a group if there are fixed bounds both on the order of all of its elements and the number of elements  needed to generate it, and also for Burnside's lemma (a formula relating the number of orbits of a permutation group acting on a set with the number of fixed points of each of its elements) though the latter had been discovered earlier and independently by Frobenius and Augustin Cauchy./nHe received an honorary doctorate (D.Sc.) from the University of Dublin in June 1901.[5]/nIn addition to his mathematical work, Burnside was a noted rower. While he was a lecturer at Cambridge, he also coached the rowing crew team.

When he was of age, he was educated at the Jesuit college there. After he completed his studies there in 1687, he entered the novitiate of the Camaldolese monks at Ferrara and took the name of Guido. In 1693 he was sent to the Monastery of St. Gregory the Great, the Camaldolese house in Rome, to complete his studies in philosophy and  theology in preparation for Holy Orders. A year later, Grandi was assigned as professor of both fields at the Camaldolese Monastery of St. Mary of the Angels in Florence. It appears that it was during this period of his life that he took an interest in mathematics. He did his research privately, however, as he was appointed professor of philosophy at St. Gregory Monastery in 1700, subsequently holding a post in the same field in Pisa, where he replaced Pascasio Giannetti./nBy 1707, however, Dom Grandi had developed such a reputation in the field of mathematics that he was named court mathematician to the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Cosimo III de Medici. In that post, he also worked as an engineer, being appointed Superintendent of Water for the Duchy, and in that capacity, he was involved in the drainage of the Chiana Valley. In 1709 he visited England where he clearly impressed his colleagues there, as he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. The University of Pisa named him Professor of Mathematics in 1714. It was there that he died on 4 July 1742./nIn 1701 Grandi published a study of the conical loxodrome, followed by a study in 1703 of the curve which he named versiera, from the Latin: vertere (to turn). This curve was later studied by one of the few women scientists to achieve a degree, Maria Gaetana Agnesi. Through a mistranslation by the translator of her work into English who mistook the term \"witch\" (Italian: avversiera) for Grandi's term, this curve became known in English as the witch of Agnesi.[3] It was through his studies on this curve that Grandi helped introduce Leibniz' ideas on calculus to Italy./nIn mathematics Grandi is best known for his work Flores geometrici (1728), studying the rose curve, a curve which has the shape of a petalled flower, and for Grandi's series. He named the rose curve rhodonea.

The two correspondents both recorded the event in their own homes and it is not known whether they ever met in person, but Crabtree's calculations were crucial in allowing Horrocks to estimate the size of Venus and the distance from the Earth to the Sun.

Bolton, was a British classicist, elected member of the UK's Metaphysical Society, an amateur scientist and an inventor, best known for his invention of the aileron, a primary aeronautical flight control device. He patented the aileron in 1868, some 36 years before it was first employed in manned flight by Robert Esnault-Pelterie in 1904./nBoulton was the son of Matthew Robinson Boulton, and as well the grandson of Matthew Boulton, who founded the Soho Manufactory and the Soho Mint. His grandfather also co-founded the Soho Foundry with James Watt, which employed steam engines of the latter's design. Born into a family of significant wealth and means, M.\u00a0P.\u00a0W. was broadly educated in the classics, philosophy and sciences, subsequently becoming well versed in steam engine design, and then transferring his interest to the basic conceptual designs of jet propulsion and rocket motors. However, whatever personal interest he held in the foundry's operation and the coinage mint he inherited from his father soon waned, and he subsequently closed and sold the mint facility in 1850. Thereafter he conducted numerous studies, wrote a wide variety of papers and earned a number of patents, including for an aileron flight control system, various types of motive power engines and their components such as propellers and pumps, plus other works on solar heat, photography and more./nDespite being married twice and raising a large family, Boulton was described as reclusive by those who knew him. He was one of only five members of the Metaphysical Society who did not appear in the British Dictionary of National Biography. His Times obituary described him as \"a gifted member of a gifted family ... [with] wide knowledge and sterling qualities\"; however, he appears to have never sought notability nor gained it in his lifetime, and his accomplishments are known chiefly through his patents and published writings./nBoulton was born 22 September 1820 at Mose Old Norton, Staffordshire, England, to Matthew Robinson Boulton (8 August 1770 \u2013 16 May 1842) and Mary Anne Wilkinson (27 November 1795 \u2013 7 June 1829).[1][2] He was baptized at St. Mary's Church, Handsworth, Staffordshire on 9 November 1820. M.\u00a0P.\u00a0W.'s ancestors can be traced back to John Bolton (his surname missing the u, which was included one or two generations later) of Lichfield, Staffordshire, who married (the later-to-be wealthy) Elizabeth, daughter of Matthew Dyott of Stichbrooke, Staffordshire in the late 15th century. John Bolton is believed descended from, possibly a grandson of Robert Bolton (1572 \u2013 19 December 1631), rector of Broughton, Northamptonshire in 1609 until his death.[1]/nM.\u00a0P.\u00a0W. Boulton's immediate family included two younger brothers (both whom survived childhood but died unmarried) as well as three sisters and eight cousins.  His brother-in-law, James Patrick Muirhead (1813\u20131890, husband to Boulton's elder sister Katharine Elizabeth, 1816\u20131890),[Note 1] would become James Watt's biographer.[5]/nBoulton's grandfather Matthew Boulton and James Watt had perfected the steam engine during the 1770s which soon set off the Industrial Revolution in England, and later the rest of the world. Matthew Piers Watt was named after his grandfather as well as his grandfather's close business partner, James Watt who had jointly created the Soho Foundry which employed their engines. Boulton's second given name also reflected the family of his great-grandmother, the Piers of Chester, Bull Ring, Birmingham.[6]/nIn 1815\u20131816 M.\u00a0P.\u00a0W.'s father, Matthew Robinson Boulton, bought the 3,250 hectares (8,000 acres) Great Tew Estate and manor in the civil parish of Cotswold Hills in Oxfordshire.[7] In 1825 he added a Gothic Revival library to the east end of the manor house, and by the middle of the 19th century the Boulton family had a large Tudor style section designed by F.S. Waller added to the west end.[8] The Great Tew Estate would remain with Boulton's immediate family until M.\u00a0P.\u00a0W.'s son Matthew Ernest Boulton died without heirs in 1914,[9] after which it was eventually inherited by a more distant relative./nBoulton's early education included instruction at a private school in Royal Leamington Spa (simply called Leamington) run by Reverend Atwood, the Vicar of Kenilworth. There were but six boys in this school with a good measure of religious instruction. He attended with his younger brother Hugh William (1821\u20131847) who would die at age 26, and with Francis Galton, later Sir Francis Galton, the brilliant English polymath who became his friend and remained so through Cambridge.[10]/nBoulton studied the classics, philosophy and sciences at Eton.[11] In one letter written from Eton with \"boyish enthusiasm\", Boulton described life at his boarding school:[12]/n\"About a week ago two boys named Waring & Stanley . . . having procured a pack of beagles went out hunting, and, being discovered by Mr Luxmoore, ran away. They were not heard of for two or three days after, but they came back on Monday, and were flogged and turned down.....\"  \"The chief games are still foot-ball and hockey, but a great many go out in boats, which however are forbidden at this time.....\"  \"My new companion Fane is rather older than I am, as he will be 14 in May, he is rather good-natured, and is neither clever nor stupid.\"/nIn October 1838 Boulton entered Trinity College, Cambridge where he undertook studies of mathematics, logic and the classics. His first tutor in Cambridge was the English mathematician George Peacock (then Cambridge's Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and a friend of Charles Babbage).[11][13] Among Boulton's earliest accomplishments was earning the Eton Prize in February 1839 for his essay, The Decline and Fall of the Persian Empire,[14] and an award for his collection of witty epigrams at Cambridge University in 1841.[7][15] He also won two of Cambridge's Sir William Browne Medals for Latin and Greek poetry.[Note 2] Dr. Chris Upton of Birmhingham's Newman University wrote on Boulton's 1841 Latin poem Vehicula vi vaporis impulsa, roughly meaning \"Vehicles driven by the power of steam\". Describing Boulton's poem in an English rendering, Upton wrote:[16]/n\"Devilish\" he calls the machine, cutting through the middle of mountains, slicing through the countryside. Faster than a thunderbolt it speeds... until..:/n\"But ah! an axle breaks, and then \nOff line the train goes crashing \nWith dire destruction, men on men, \nNoses on noses dashing. . .\"\n\n\"Of such mere trifles, who complains? \nMay science reign eternal, \nAnd in these railroad days run trains/nExpress to realms infernal.\"/nHowever even as a young man Boulton earned a reputation for avoiding the notice of his peers as he had \"...no wish to attract the attention of his contemporaries\", eventually eschewing university scholarships and other limelight. Boulton showed a \"compete indifference to all the rewards and distinctions attached to the manifestations of them\", as written by his second Cambridge tutor, Reverend John Moore Heath (1808\u20131882), in a letter to the student's father and sponsor. Boulton's refusal to compete for Trinity and other university scholarships was based on his belief that the competitions did \"more harm than good\", and in any event their awards were of far greater value to the poor students of the university.[7]/nBoulton graduated from Cambridge with his B.A. in 1845.[18]/nBoulton was married twice; his first marriage on 27 November 1845 was to Frances Eliza Cartwright (b. Northamptonshire 1817 \u2013 d. Great Malvern, Worcestershire 1864), the daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel William Ralph Cartwright and his second wife Julia Frances Aubrey.[1][11] Her father served as a Tory politician and sat in the British House of Commons between 1797 and 1846.[11][19] Boulton's first marriage produced two daughters, Marianne Aubrey (sometimes Mary Anne Audrey, b. London, 1854\u20131934)[Note 3] and Ethel Julia (b. Tew, 1858\u20131924).[11]/nAfter selling Soho House and his father's mint facility in 1850, Boulton retired to his family's manor and estate of Great Tew, in the Oxfordshire village of the same name, and also living in London.[23] An 1851 census listed him at the former as a landed proprietor, along with a nephew, Thomas Robert Cartwright (age 20), and nine servants.[11]/nFollowing the death of his first wife Frances Eliza in 1864, Boulton remarried with Pauline Gleissberg (b. Germany, 1837\u20131911),[Note 4] daughter of Ernst Gleissberg, dean of the city of Cannstatt in the German kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg.[1][24] Together they had four children: Clara Gertrude (later to be Lady of the Manor of Great Tew,[25] b. Knightsbridge, 1868\u20131954),[Note 5] his first son Matthew Ernest Kensington (b. Paddington, 1870\u20131914),[Note 6] Pauline Margaret (b. Switzerland, 1872\u20131918) and Frederick Montagu (b. Great Tew, 1875\u20131912).[11][Note 7]/nBoulton became a Justice of the Peace, Deputy Lieutenant, and High Sheriff of Oxfordshire before the age of 30.[7][11] He was part of the landed gentry due to his family's holdings at Tew Park, and the Great Haseley Court estate and manor that M.\u00a0P.\u00a0W. later purchased in Tetworth, Gloucestershire in 1880.\n[21][28][Note 8] Boulton improved the Tew estate by enlarging its grand three-story manor house, adding another garden and refining its grove./nWith the death of his father in 1848, he inherited the large fortune created by both his father's and grandfather's enterprises, permitting him, his large household and his relatives a comfortable life. Up to 11 servants were employed to administer to his manor and estate.[11][15] Boulton's inheritance made him wealthy, but he had little desire to continue his family's businesses which he subsequently closed, disposing of their assets by sale. His financial independence allowed him to pursue studies and writings as a philosopher-scientist on a wide variety of subjects. Among them were at least two pamphlets in the early 1860s refuting the authenticity of purported 18th-century photographs;[7][Note 9] verse translations of the classics including Homer's Iliad, Virgil's \u00c6neid and other classical works during the mid-1870s; papers on metaphysics from the late 1870s, and as well two pamphlets on solar energy written in the early 1890s.[11][15] He earned over a dozen patents for multiple inventions, many of them for aircraft propulsion systems. At least one patent was assigned to George Westinghouse, Jr, the American industrial tycoon.[31][32][33]/nHis financial independence allowed him not to pursue any particular career aggressively. He was described as reclusive to the point that his \"wide knowledge and sterling qualities were known only to a few\".[15] While others of wealth and ability often sought greater wealth, notability and positions of power, Boulton was to eventually become notable for being unnotable. In his lifetime he had  \"...no wish to attract the attention of his contemporaries\"./nKenyon College Professor of History Bruce Kinzer's 2009 biographic sketch of Boulton, possibly the only one ever published, posited that \"Boulton has not posthumously gained the recognition he never sought during his lifetime.\" The philosopher-scientist-inventor's non-notability extended to missing entries in Boase's Modern English Biography, the Dictionary of National Biography  (where he was one of only five members of the Metaphysical Society who did not appear in it)[34] and the later Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.[7]/nHowever other researchers have on occasion drawn attention to the Boulton's achievements, pointed to in 1911 in Britain's leading aviation magazine, Flight (\"Two Interesting Patents\"),[35] and later by aviation historian C. H. Gibbs-Smith (\"The First Aileron\").[36] Boulton's flight control device, first described in his 1868 patent, \"Aerial Locomotion, &c\", was publicly praised by the pioneering U.S. aeronautical engineer Charles Manly. While addressing the Society of Automotive Engineers in 1916, Manly referred directly to Boulton's invention, telling his audience:[7]/n... the system of lateral balancing or control now so universally used; [is] that of supplementary planes, now called ailerons. The description he gave of these in his British patent was thorough and clear. It is the first record we have of appreciation of the necessity for active lateral control as distinguished from the passive lateral equilibrium secured by having wings set at a dihedral angle. With this invention of Boulton's we have the birth of the present-day three torque method of airborne control. The only thing then lacking [in 1868] to enable man to learn to operate flying machines was the one great organ \u2013 a suitable engine./nIn his lifetime Boulton was likely better noted for his membership in the eclectic Metaphysical Society, a short-lived association (1869\u20131880) of some of Britain's most gifted philosophers, theologians, academics and political leaders, although \"[n]o member of the Metaphysical Society knew less renown than M.P.W. Boulton\". He was elected to the society in 1874.[7] Nevertheless, the former and future British Prime Minister and society member William Gladstone, who chaired its 9 April 1878 meeting at the Grosvenor Hotel, read Boulton's philosophical treatise Has a Metaphysical Society Any Raison d'\u00eatre? (Does a metaphysical society have any reason to exist?)[37] to the assembled membership that evening. It included, in part:[13]/n\"[B]efore ... breaking up our society, let us consider the matter a little further ...\" \"There is no question, however apparently non-metaphysical, which may not be pursued till we come to the Metaphysical. The question of whether Tarquin lived, and whether Lucretia committed suicide, is about as non-metaphysical as any question can be: yet disputants engaged in its discussion may persist till they open up the general question of the credibility of testimony; and this may open that of the credibility of memory, the nature of belief, what grounds we have for believing the existence of other persons, and an external world ... Whenever we try to bottom a question or subject, to use Locke's word (the French word would be \"approfondir\") then Metaphysics come in sight  ... Every sentence involves, in some shape or other, the verb \"to be\", and this, if pursued long enough, leads to the heart of Metaphysics  ... Scientific persons often speak of Metaphysics with scorn, calling them an Asylum Ignorantiae, useful enough to the vulgar, but in no way needed by themselves. They imagine their science to be perfectly luminous, far above the lower regions where Metaphysical mists prevail. But in reality they share the common lot:  the ideas of Force, Law, Cause, Substance, Causal or Active Matter, all dwell in the region of metaphysical twilight, not in the luminous ether.\"/nThe work was described by Alan Brown as a \"brilliant paper\", ultimately leading to the beginning of the end of the Society,[7] its \"kiss of death\". According to Catherine Hajdenko-Marshall, Boulton's paper argued that in free and open societies, \"the plurality of ideas meant that debate was [essentially] impossible\".[38] But, apparently, despite its importance to the Society, Boulton may not have attended the reading of his own work.[7]/nM.\u00a0P.\u00a0W. Boulton died in London on 30 June 1894 at age 73.[Note 10] This was soon noted by The Times which wrote in his obituary that he was:[7]/n... a most gifted member of a gifted family, the inheritor of a large fortune, and highly cultured; but, being naturally a recluse, with no care for self-assertion, his wide knowledge and sterling qualities were known only to a few/nAfter Boulton's death his eldest son Matthew retained the Great Tew Estate until his own death, still single, in 1914,[9] after which the estate fell into general disrepair, unused for a number of decades. Boulton's great-nephew Major Eustace Robb renovated the estate and lived there from 1952 until his demise in 1985.[39][40]/nBoulton Peak is a mountain summit at the southeast side of Curtiss Bay, about 9 kilometres (5.6\u00a0mi) south of Cape Andreas in Antarctica. It was mapped from air photos taken between 1955 and 1957 and named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1960 to honour Boulton for his invention of the aileron.[41]/nIn 1868, long before the advent of powered aircraft flight \u2013 and within a decade of the birth of both Orville and Wilbur Wright \u2013 Boulton patented the first aileron.[42][43][Note 11]  The aileron system he created was to be actuated by either a hand-operated control (not illustrated on the patent's drawings) or by an automatic pendulum control device (depicted on the patent's drawing sheet), with the intended function of a single-axis autopilot.[47] Boulton's inspiration for a lateral flight control device has been attributed to French Count Ferdinand Charles Honore Phillipe d'Esterno, whose detailed analysis of flapping and soaring bird flight, Du Vol des Oiseaux (On the flight of birds) was published as a pamphlet in 1864.[48] Although Boulton's prescient aileron control system was fully functional, he, as did almost everyone of his era, lacked a detailed understanding of aerodynamics, and an airplane he designed never achieved flight.[49][Note 12]/nAilerons are a key device for the lateral flight control of airplanes to enable their safe flight. They are still in almost universal use in the present day by civilian and military aircraft,[46][51][52] and even on the most sophisticated jetliners.[53][54][Note 13] In 1873, five years after Boulton's aileron patent, the French military engineer and aircraft designer Charles Renard built and flew at St.-Eloi, near Arras, a small unmanned multi-wing glider incorporating ailerons (which he termed \"winglets\") on each side of its body, controlled by Boulton's pendulum control single-axis autopilot device with a design layout that closely matched the patent.[51][55][56][Note 14]/nBoulton's Letter's Patent specifications were sealed on 4 August 1868 and the complete patent was backdated to its application date of 5 February 1868.[47] His British patent, the 392nd one completed in 1868, was issued more than 35 years before ailerons were 'reinvented' in France,[48] and ailerons were later repatented in the United States by Glenn Curtiss of the Aerial Experiment Association in about 1911.[Note 15] Boulton's 1868 patent became forgotten and lost from sight until the same time,[36][58] a few years before they came into general use in 1915.[35][59][Note 16] Aviation historian C. H. Gibbs-Smith acknowledged Boulton's priority of invention, stating that if the 1868 patent had been revealed at the time of the Wright brothers' legal filings, they might not have been able to claim the priority of invention for the lateral control of flying machines.[36]/nAlthough Boulton had described ailerons in 1864 and then patented them in 1868, no one is known to have used them in manned aircraft flight until Robert Esnault-Pelterie's glider, 36 years later in 1904[60][61] (Renard's 1871 glider flights using pendulum controlled \"winglets\" were unmanned). Esnault-Pelterie, a French aeronautical engineer, built a Wright brothers-style biplane glider that year, which had first used their wing warping design that he had also copied,[46][48][62] but the glider's control in flight was found to be poor and was then changed over to ailerons,[63] although another source states the changeover was due to his view that wing warping was structurally dangerous.[60]/nThe French journal L'A\u00e9rophile later published photos of Esnault-Pelterie's glider with its inter-wing ailerons in June 1905, and ailerons were then copied by other aircraft designers, with the interwing ailerons showing up on the final-flown revision of Alberto Santos-Dumont's 14-bis canard biplane on 12 November 1906, popularized by American pilot and aircraft designer Glenn Curtiss with his Golden Flyer first self-designed aircraft in 1909, and entering widespread use by 1915.[54][64] The Wrights, having vigorously fought others using any form of lateral flight control without the payment of onerous licensing fees to them,[65][66] quietly changed their aircraft flight control systems from wing warping to ailerons at that time as well. It is unknown whether Esnault-Pelterie had seen Boulton's patent or reinvented ailerons independently./nGibbs-Smith later wrote in his 1960 opus, The Aeroplane: An Historical Survey of its Origins and Development, that \"Boulton invented a method of control identical with the modern aileron control system in 1868. Had it not been overlooked, the history of the practical aeroplane would have been radically different, since it was the problem of achieving lateral stability and control that plagued the Wrights, Langley, Curtiss, and the whole \"European School\" 30\u201340 years later\".[58]/n1868 Boulton patent, No. 392: A\u00ebrial Locomotion Etcetera/nBoulton's description of his aileron control system was both clear and complete. It was \"the first record we have of appreciation of the necessity for active lateral control as distinguished from [passive lateral stability].... With this invention of Boulton's we have the birth of the present-day three torque method of airborne control\" as was praised by Charles Manly.[7] This was also endorsed by C. H. Gibbs-Smith.[36][58]/nThe patent's actual wording of ailerons reads (page 16, from line 8):[47]/nFor the safety of aerial vessel it is important to provide a controlling power not only to direct their horizontal and vertical course, but also to prevent their turning over by rotating on the longitudinal axis. A certain stability of the kind desired is afforded by using an extended surface whose sides make an angle from the axis upwards\u00a0... But it is desirable to provide a more powerful action preventing [rolling] rotation of the body in this direction.  For this purpose a rudder of the following construction may be adopted:\u2014Vanes or movable surfaces are attached to arms projecting from the vessel laterally or at right angles to its length. When these vanes are not required to act they present their edges to the front, so as to offer little resistance to the vessel's movement, but if the vessel should begin to rotate [roll] on the longitudinal axis the vanes are moved so as to take inclined positions, those on the ascending side of the vessel being caused to rotate to such an inclination that the air impinging upon them exerts a pressure downwards, while those on the descending side are so inclined that the air impinging upon them exerts a pressure upwards, thus the balance of the vessel is redressed and its further rotation prevented. The vanes may be moved by hand or by self-acting mechanism...../nThree figures (No. 5\u20137) of his aileron system were provided on the patent's attached drawing sheet, and on page 19 his explanation of the drawings reads (page 19, from line 22):[47]/nFigure 5 represents a transverse section of a plane fitted with rudders constructed according to my Invention to prevent its turning over on an axis in its line of motion through the air.  a is a section of the plane which is supposed to have taken a position inclined to the horizon; b and c are two vanes mounted on axes one at each side of the plane, so that it can be turned round like a throttle valve....\"/nNowhere in the patent is there a description of mounting the ailerons on the trailing edges of the airplane's wings, where they would have induced adverse yaw, but only \"...\u00a0on arms projecting from the vessel laterally\".[47] Indeed, the first ailerons used by Robert Esnault-Pelterie in 1904[48] were mounted inter-wing, not on the trailing edges of the glider's wings where they would have created unequal aileron drag.[67]/nThere are still conflicting claims today over who first invented the aileron. Other 19th century engineers and scientists, including Charles Renard, Alphonse P\u00e9naud, and Louis Mouillard, had described similar flight control surfaces, possibly serving as further inspiration to Boulton aside from Count d'Esterno. Another technique for lateral flight control, wing warping, was also described or experimented with by several people including Jean-Marie Le Bris, John Montgomery, Clement Ader, Edson Gallaudet, D. D. Wells, and Hugo Mattullath.[46][68] Aviation historian C. H. Gibbs-Smith wrote that the aileron was \"...\u00a0one of the most remarkable inventions\u00a0... of aeronautical history, which was immediately lost sight of\".[46]/nIn an apparent oversight by the U.S. Patent Office, the Wright brothers, on their second attempt, obtained a patent in 1906, not for the invention of an airplane (which had already existed for a number of decades in the form of gliders) but for the invention of a system of aerodynamic control that manipulated a flying machine's surfaces, including lateral flight control.[69] They did so despite rudders, elevators and ailerons having been invented long before their efforts began, and then aggressively sued other aircraft builders worldwide for failure to pay them licensing royalties on the basis of the lateral flight control described in their expansive 1906 patent.  Irrespective of such controversies it was Boulton, indisputably, who was the first to patent ailerons in 1868. The ailerons used by Esnault-Pelterie in 1904 followed Boulton's concept, although it is unknown whether he had studied the 1868 work, or if he had reinvented them independently./nIn 1864 Boulton looked at the problems of combustion at constant pressure, in connection with the operation of an industrial gas turbine. His British patent, No. 1636 of 1864, contains points of interest. He realized that the high velocity of the gas jet exiting his combustion chamber nozzle offered a practical difficulty, and proposed to remedy this by the use of successive induced jets of increasing volume and consequently lower velocity. This was shown in his drawing, with gases being delivered through collinear nozzles of increasing diameter, with the outer nozzles operating at increased gas volumes with reduced velocities, similar to the exhaust of a high-bypass turbofan jet engine.[70]/nAnother method proposed by Boulton for maintaining combustion at constant pressure was shown with gas burned in an inverted chamber under water, the products of combustion passing up through the water between the baffle plates and the mixed gases and steam being later delivered to a turbine.[70] He went on to file a number of patents related to his gas turbine research (see patents)./nBoulton also attempted to build an ornithopter, an aircraft which would create lift by the movement of its articulating wings.[43] A manned ornithopter was later created in 2006 when teams at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS) achieved a working design with large flapping wing areas. With assist from a jet engine it only flew for about 300 meters on its only flight.[71][72]/nBesides Boulton's invention of a primary flight control, the aileron, the family name may also be associated with the well known British firm that provided wartime aircraft production as Boulton Paul Aircraft. Boulton Paul Aircraft Ltd was a British aircraft manufacturer that was created in 1934, although its start in aircraft manufacturing began earlier in 1914, and lasted until 1961. The company mainly built and modified aircraft under contract to other manufacturers, but had a few notable designs of its own, such as the Boulton Paul Defiant./nThe company's origins date back to a Norwich ironmonger's shop founded in 1797. William Staples Boulton joined the Norfolk ironworks firm of Moore & Barnard in 1844.  By 1870 William had been elevated to a partner and the firm was renamed to Barnard & Boulton, later becoming Boulton & Paul Ltd. The latter firm began its construction engineering division in 1905.[73] In the early 1900s, Boulton & Paul became a successful general manufacturing firm, also starting an aircraft production operation in 1914\u20131915.[74] The aircraft manufacturing division was spun off from the main construction business in 1934, subsequently moving to Wolverhampton./nBoulton's known works under his name include:[75]/nAlthough no definitive proof is known to exist that Boulton was also published under the pen name M.\u00a0P.\u00a0W. Bolton, researcher and author Alan Brown wrote in The Metaphysical Society: Victorian Minds in Crisis, 1869\u20131880, that Boulton was also sometimes spelt as 'Bolton'. Brown was perhaps convinced of that since no biographical information exists for any 'M.\u00a0P.\u00a0W. Bolton', Bolton was, in fact, Boulton's pseudonymous pen name.[7][Note 17] Somewhat intriguingly, Boulton's younger brother, Montagu Boulton (1824\u20131849), was admitted to Cambridge University's Inner Temple (a law society) as \"Matthew Bolton\" in October 1844.[18][Note 18] Additionally, M.\u00a0P.\u00a0W.'s distant ancestors' surnames omitted the 'u', from their spelling. That included John Bolton of Lichfield, Staffordshire, who is believed descended from, possibly a grandson of Robert Bolton (1572\u20131631), rector of Broughton, Northamptonshire.[1]/nUnder the alternate 'Bolton' spelling the British Museum lists several philosophical works (all published by Chapman & Hall, which had also published most of Boulton's works), including:/nSeveral of the Bolton writings fiercely attacked the theological positions expounded by Scottish philosopher Sir William Hamilton and the metaphysician Henry Longueville Mansel, who both argued that God was \"infinite\" and \"absolute\". One possible reason for the alternate pen name in confronting authority figures may then have been that of deniability. An edition of John Stuart Mill's Examination of Sir William Hamilton's Philosophy later led the English political radical George Grote to examine Bolton's Inquisitio Philosophica, and prompted Mill to write that its author \"is a scholar, well read in history of philosophy and.... [shows] that he holds with the inductive school, both in their philosophy and in its consequences\". Mills thought the work's author an \"acute thinker\" and Inquisitio an \"able work\"./nKinzer's examination of the same work led him to a firmer belief that Bolton and Boulton were also one and the same. Additionally, a letter by an M.\u00a0P.\u00a0W. Bolton is archived at Trinity College, Cambridge, although a biographical work listing all of the university's known students has no record of any such person, only that of Boulton. Examination of other letters written by both Bolton and Boulton also hold that their handwriting scripts closely resemble each other.[7]/nSubject to various international agreements, patents filed in one country were normally also valid in the other contracting states which participated in them. Boulton's patents include (UK, unless otherwise specified):/nFootnotes/nCitations/nBibliography", "3463190": "Ormond Stone (January 11, 1847 \u2013 January 17, 1933), was an American astronomer, mathematician and educator. He was the director of Cincinnati Observatory and subsequently the first director of the McCormick Observatory at the University of Virginia, where he trained a significant number of scientists. He served as the editor of the Annals of Mathematics and towards the end of his life made donations which led to the founding of the Fairfax Public Library System.[1]/nStone was born in Pekin, Illinois, to Methodist minister Elijah and Sophia Louise (Creighton) Stone. While attending Chicago High School, he met Truman Henry Safford, an astronomer at the recently completed Dearborn Observatory. Stone became his pupil, quickly beginning his lifelong interest in astronomy. In 1866, Stone enrolled at the Old University of Chicago, graduating with a degree of master's degree in 1870. Working his way through school, he served as an instructor in 1867\u20131868 at Racine College in Wisconsin, then at the Northwestern Female College (which is now a part of Northwestern University) at Evanston, Illinois in 1869. Also that year, he participated in what would be the first of three eclipse expeditions in his lifetime. It was on this trip to Des Moines, Iowa, with Safford that he met astronomers from the United States Naval Observatory (USNO). He would end up being in charge of the later two expeditions, the first in 1878, when he led the USNO expedition to Colorado, and the May 28, 1900 eclipse, when he led the McCormick Observatory expedition to Winesboro, South Carolina. Upon graduating from the University of Chicago in 1870, he accepted an assistantship at the USNO, where he stayed until 1875. He was assigned to the Meridian Circle, under William Harkness. His tenure there coincided with the arrival of the 26-inch (660\u00a0mm) Alvan Clark refractor at the Naval Observatory. This telescope was essentially a twin to the future McCormick Refractor. In 1871, he married Catherine Flagler of Washington, D.C./nIn 1875, Stone accepted the directorship of the Cincinnati Observatory, having received a recommendation from Simon Newcomb. While there, he instituted a program of discovering new southern double stars and was the first to establish standard time for an American city, and he pushed for the adoption of Standard Time Belts (or zones, as we now know them)./nIn 1882, Stone was offered the position of director at the brand new observatory being built at the University of Virginia, and was accompanied from Cincinnati by John Jones and Frank P. Leavenworth. Stone oversaw the final stages of construction on the observatory, which was completed in 1885, but began astronomical work almost immediately upon his arrival in Charlottesville. Stone's work focused largely on observing nebulae, southern variables and double stars./nAs director, Stone's responsibilities included fundraising, which he detested and did very poorly. Though the observatory was always short of funds, he used funds donated by William Henry Vanderbilt to establish three fellowships, $350 for a year, to pay for assistants at the observatory. The list of Vanderbilt Fellows who worked under Stone was an impressive one, and included astronomers, university presidents, professors and professionals in various fields, including:/nStone remained at the McCormick Observatory until 1912. In his time there, he taught various astronomy courses for the university; founded the Annals of Mathematics in 1884, funding the publication with his own money, and edited the journal until 1899 (after which he served on the editorial board); founded the Philosophical Society at the university; and spent much of the final ten years of his directorship in the cause for secondary education in Virginia. He was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (Member: 1875; Fellow: 1876; chair, Committee on Standard Time: 1880; Member of Committee on Stellar Magnitudes: 1880; Vice-president, Astronomy and Mathematics: 1887; Vice-president of Section A: Astrometry, of Department 11: Astronomy: 1888; Chair: 1901 Councilor, Section A, Mathematics and Astronomy: 1902\u20131905; Sectional Committee, Section A: 1905\u20131907; Emeritus Life Member: 1927), the American Astronomical and Astrophysical Society, now known as the American Astronomical Society (Councilor 1899\u20131909), and the American Mathematical Society (Councilor 1897), among many other academic societies. He served on the Board of Visitors (as Secretary) for the United States Naval Observatory from 1901 to 1903, served on the first Advisory Committee on Mathematics for the Carnegie Institution of Washington starting in 1902, and was a trustee of Harrisonburg Normal College (now James Madison University). He also maintained contacts with people of influence across the country, including his brother Melville E. Stone, the founder of the Chicago Daily News, who became well known as the General Manager of Associated Press./nHe retired on a stipend from the Carnegie Foundation in 1912 to a 30-acre (120,000\u00a0m2) farm in Centreville, Virginia. Stone attended a local, little stone Methodist church on Braddock Road, now known as the Church of the Ascension, Anglican. His wife died in 1914, and he later married Mary Florence Brennan of Lansing, Michigan. He brought Mary back to Centreville, along with her two sisters, Grace and Elizabeth. He continued to be active in the educational, religious and social problems of his local community and the state./nHe served as Vice President of the Virginia State Teachers' Association, and was a leader in the movement to improve Virginia's public school system (in 1991, Ormond Stone Middle School was opened in Centreville to honor his work)./nIn November 1929, Professor Stone and his friend, lawyer Thomas Keith, approached the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors to request space to begin a library. The county provided no funds, but a small space in an old office in the courthouse. It was the first step in the eventual establishment of the Fairfax County Public Library System. Stone spent much of his last years gathering and organizing donated books for this small library./nHe died just six days after his eighty-sixth birthday, when he was struck and instantly killed by the driver of a C&P Telephone Company vehicle while walking along the road near his farm in Centreville.[1]", "31709213": "Herbert Spohn (born 1 November 1946) is a German mathematician and mathematical physicist working in kinetic equations; dynamics of stochastic particle systems, hydrodynamic limit; kinetic of growths processes; disordered systems; open quantum systems\ndynamics of charged particles coupled to their radiation field; Schr\u00f6dinger operators; functional integration and stochastic analysis./nHis PhD was obtained in 1975 at the University of Munich under the supervision of Georg S\u00fc\u00dfmann.[1]/nHe is currently (in the year 2021) Emeritus Professor of the Department of Mathematics of the Technical University Munich.[2] [3]/nHe obtained several prizes.

For several years he taught at the \u00c9cole polytechnique./nLaurent Schwartz came from a Jewish family of Alsatian origin, with a strong scientific background: his father was a well-known surgeon, his uncle Robert Debr\u00e9 (who contributed to the creation of UNICEF) was a famous pediatrician, and his great-uncle-in-law, Jacques Hadamard, was a famous mathematician./nDuring his training at Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand to enter the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, he fell in love with Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne L\u00e9vy, daughter of the probabilist Paul L\u00e9vy who was then teaching at the \u00c9cole polytechnique. They married in 1938. Later they had two children, Marc-Andr\u00e9 and Claudine. Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne was gifted in mathematics as well, as she contributed to the geometry of singular analytic spaces and taught at the University of Lille./nAngelo Guerraggio describes \"Mathematics, politics and butterflies\" as his \"three great loves\".[1]/nAccording to his teachers, Schwartz was an exceptional student. He was particularly gifted in Latin, Greek and mathematics. One of his teachers told his parents: \"Beware, some will say your son has a gift for languages, but he is only interested in the scientific and mathematical aspect of languages: he should become a mathematician.\"/nIn 1934, he was admitted at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, and in 1937 he obtained the agr\u00e9gation (with rank 2)./nAs a man of Trotskyist affinities and Jewish descent, life was difficult for Schwartz during World War II. He had to hide and change his identity to avoid being deported after Nazi Germany overran France. He worked for the University of Strasbourg (which had been relocated to Clermont-Ferrand because of the war) under the name of Laurent-Marie S\u00e9limartin (his thesis \"\u00c9tude des sommes d'exponentielles r\u00e9elles\" being however published in 1943 under his real name in the Publications de l'Institut de Math\u00e9matique de l'Universit\u00e9 de Clermont-Ferrand, volume 959 of Hermann's Actualit\u00e9s scientifiques et industrielles), while Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne used the name Leng\u00e9 instead of L\u00e9vy. Unlike other mathematicians at Clermont-Ferrand such as Feldbau, the couple managed to escape the Nazis./nSchwartz taught mainly at \u00c9cole Polytechnique, from 1958 to 1980. At the end of the war, he spent one year in Grenoble (1944), then in 1945 joined the University of Nancy on the advice of Jean Delsarte and Jean Dieudonn\u00e9, where he spent seven years. He was both an influential researcher and teacher, with students such as Bernard Malgrange, Jacques-Louis Lions, Fran\u00e7ois Bruhat and Alexander Grothendieck. He joined the science faculty of the University of Paris in 1952. In 1958 he became a teacher at the \u00c9cole polytechnique after having at first refused this position. From 1961 to 1963 the \u00c9cole polytechnique suspended his right to teach, because of his having signed the Manifesto of the 121 about the Algerian war, a gesture not appreciated by Polytechnique's military administration. However, Schwartz had a lasting influence on mathematics at the \u00c9cole polytechnique, having reorganized both teaching and research there. In 1965 he established the Centre de math\u00e9matiques Laurent-Schwartz (CMLS) as its first director./nIn 1973 he was elected corresponding member of the French Academy of Sciences, and was promoted to full membership in 1975./nIn 1950 at the ICM, Schwartz was a plenary speaker[2] and was awarded the Fields Medal  for his work on distributions. He was the first French mathematician to receive the Fields medal. Because of his sympathy for Trotskyism, Schwartz encountered serious problems trying to enter the United States to receive the medal; however, he was ultimately successful./nThe theory of distributions clarified the (then) mysteries of the Dirac delta function and Heaviside step function. It helps to extend the theory of Fourier transforms and is now of critical importance to the theory of partial differential equations./nThroughout his life, Schwartz actively worked to promote science and bring it closer to the general audience. Schwartz said: \"What are mathematics helpful for? Mathematics are helpful for physics. Physics helps us make fridges. Fridges are made to contain spiny lobsters, and spiny lobsters help mathematicians who eat them and have hence better abilities to do mathematics, which are helpful for physics, which helps us make fridges which...\"[3]/nHis mother, who was passionate about natural science, passed on her taste for entomology to Laurent.

Several species discovered by Schwartz bear his name./nApart from his scientific work, Schwartz was a well-known outspoken intellectual.

He made substantial contributions to algebraic topology and also took an interest in literature, philosophy, history and mathematics education.[1]/nFreudenthal was born in Luckenwalde, Brandenburg, on 17 September 1905, the son of a Jewish teacher. He was interested in both mathematics and literature as a child, and studied mathematics at the University of Berlin beginning in 1923.[2][3] He met L. E. J. Brouwer in 1927, when Brouwer came to Berlin to give a lecture, and in the same year Freudenthal also visited the University of Paris.[3][4] He completed his thesis work with Heinz Hopf at Berlin, defended a thesis on the ends of topological groups in 1930, and was officially awarded a degree in October 1931.[2][3][5] After defending his thesis in 1930, he moved to Amsterdam to take up a position as assistant to Brouwer.[2][3] In this pre-war period in Amsterdam, he was promoted to lecturer at the University of Amsterdam,[3][4] and married his wife, Suus Lutter, a Dutch teacher.[2]/nAlthough he was a German Jew, Freudenthal's position in the Netherlands insulated him from the anti-Jewish laws that had been passed in Germany beginning with the Nazi rise to power in 1933.[3] However, in 1940 the Germans invaded the Netherlands, following which Freudenthal was suspended from duties at the University of Amsterdam by the Nazis.[3][4] In 1943 Freudenthal was sent to a labor camp in the village of Havelte in the Netherlands, but with the help of his wife (who, as a non-Jew, had not been deported) he escaped in 1944 and went into hiding with his family in occupied Amsterdam.[6] During this period Freudenthal occupied his time in literary pursuits, including winning first prize under a false name in a novel-writing contest.[3]/nWith the war over, Freudenthal's position at the University of Amsterdam was returned to him, but in 1946 he was given a chair in pure and applied mathematics and foundations of mathematics at Utrecht University, where he remained for the rest of his career.[2][3] He served as the 8th president of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction from 1967 to 1970.[7] In 1971 he founded the Institute for the Development of Mathematical Education (IOWO) at Utrecht University, which after his death was renamed the Freudenthal Institute.[3] In 1972 he founded and became editor-in-chief of the journal Geometriae Dedicata.[8] He retired from his professorship in 1975[3] and from his journal editorship in 1981.[8] He died in Utrecht in 1990, sitting on a bench in a park where he always took a morning walk.[2]/nIn his thesis work, published as a journal article in 1931, Freudenthal introduced the concept of an end of a topological space.[9] Ends are intended to capture the intuitive idea of a direction in which the space extends to infinity, but have a precise mathematical formulation in terms of covers of the space by nested sequences of compact sets. Ends remain of great importance in topological group theory, Freudenthal's motivating application,[10] and also in other areas of mathematics such as the study of minimal surfaces./nIn 1936, while working with Brouwer, Freudenthal proved the Freudenthal spectral theorem on the existence of uniform approximations by simple functions in Riesz spaces.[11] In 1937 he proved the Freudenthal suspension theorem, showing that the suspension operation on topological spaces shifts by one their low-dimensional homotopy groups; this result was important in understanding the homotopy groups of spheres (since every sphere can be formed topologically as a suspension of a lower-dimensional sphere) and eventually formed the basis of stable homotopy theory.[12] The Freudenthal magic square is a construction in Lie algebra developed by Freudenthal (and independently by Jacques Tits) in the 1950s and 1960s, associating each Lie algebra to a pair of division algebras.[13]/nIn 1968, Freudenthal founded the journal, Educational Studies in Mathematics (ESM). Becoming one of the top-rated journals in the field of mathematics education, ESM was focused on publishing research around finding better ways to teach mathematics.[14]/nLater in his life, Freudenthal focused on elementary mathematics education. In the 1970s, his single-handed intervention prevented the Netherlands from following the worldwide trend of \"new math\".[2] He was also a fervent critic of one of the first international school achievement studies.[15] He interpreted mathematics as a human activity where students should open a scientific eye on the world around them, mathematizing real situations, in a context that makes sense for the students. This approach is called Realistic Mathematics Education (RME).[16]/nFreudenthal published the Impossible Puzzle, a mathematical puzzle that appears to lack sufficient information for a solution, in 1969.[17] He also designed a constructed language,  Lincos,  to make possible communication with extraterrestrial intelligence.[18][19]/nIn 1951, Freudenthal became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[21] He was also an honorary member of the International Academy of the History of Science.[4]\nHe was awarded the Gouden Ganzenveer award in 1984.[22]/nIn 2000, the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction instituted an award named in honor of Freudenthal, the Hans Freudenthal Medal.

He played college football for the Rice Owls. A three-time Pro Bowl selection with Cleveland, Ryan led the Browns to their most recent National Football League title in 1964. He was also a mathematician, serving as a faculty member at Case Western Reserve University from 1967 to 1974./nRyan played football while attending R. L. Paschal High School in Fort Worth, Texas. He was recruited by college coaches from across the country, including Bear Bryant, and he was admitted to Yale University. Ryan declared a major in physics at Rice University,[1] becoming the first in his family not to go to Yale.[2] He was unable to establish himself during the course of his collegiate career, splitting time behind center with King Hill, who was receiving most of the snaps./nGiven his desire to obtain a Ph.D., Ryan originally decided not to play professional football after the Los Angeles Rams chose him in the fifth round of the 1958 NFL Draft.  He changed his mind after he was able to enroll at both UCLA and the University of California, Berkeley in pursuit of an advanced degree. Ryan then transferred back to Rice, where he studied during the off-season.[3]/nRyan spent the first four years of his career primarily in a reserve capacity, making $12,000 per year.[3] He did start a handful of games in competition with Billy Wade and Zeke Bratkowski. In 1961, he and future Hall of Famer Ollie Matson connected on a 96-yard touchdown reception, establishing a new team record. However, after sitting on the bench for the last four games of the 1961 season, Ryan stormed into the dressing room and threatened General Manager Elroy Hirsch that he was going to quit football if he were not traded. He became part of a multi-player deal with the Cleveland Browns on July 12, 1962, his 26th birthday, as the arrival of highly touted newcomer Roman Gabriel made Ryan expendable./nAcquired to back up starting quarterback Jim Ninowski, Ryan moved into the starting slot on October 28 when Ninowski broke his collarbone while being tackled by Pittsburgh Steelers' defensive lineman Eugene \"Big Daddy\" Lipscomb.  With no other candidates to compete with, Ryan established his leadership and held on to the starting role for much of the next six seasons.  In his first full season as a starter, 1963, Ryan threw for 2,026 yards and 25 touchdowns with only 13 interceptions, helping the Browns to a 10\u20134 record.  Thirteen of those touchdowns went to Gary Collins, who tied for the league lead in receiving touchdowns that year./nIn 1964, Ryan established himself as one of the league's best passers.  He threw for 2,404 yards and repeated his 1963 performance by completing 25 touchdown passes, which was enough to lead the league.  Ryan had excellent company on the Browns offense: fullback Jim Brown; wide receivers Gary Collins and Paul Warfield; and an outstanding offensive line which included Dick Schafrath, John Morrow, John Wooten, Monte Clark, and future Hall of Famer Gene Hickerson.  But Ryan was also a clutch performer during the Browns' memorable 10\u20133\u20131 season.  Needing a win in the December 12 regular season finale against the New York Giants to clinch a berth in the NFL title game, Ryan completed 12 of 13 passes for five touchdowns and ran for a sixth touchdown in the 52\u201320 win.  Two weeks later in the championship game against the Baltimore Colts, Ryan hit Collins for three touchdowns to win the title, 27\u20130./nRyan was rewarded for his performance with the first of three straight Pro Bowl appearances.  Unfortunately, on the first play of the second half, he suffered a severe shoulder injury in the game after the combined 800-pound trio of Packer Willie Davis, Lion Roger Brown and Colt Gino Marchetti converged on the signal caller.  Speculation persists to this day that Marchetti went out of his way to injure Ryan due to the perception that the quarterback ran up the score in the championship, with Marchetti's statement that he wanted \"one more shot\" at Ryan also fueling the rumors.  However, a study of the film by Cleveland coaches in the weeks after the game exonerated Marchetti./nAfter winning the championship, Art Modell raised his salary $25,000, up from about $18,000 per season.[3]/nRyan's numbers dropped in 1965, throwing for only 1,751 yards and 18 touchdowns.  While his shoulder had completely healed, a sore elbow in training camp and an injured arch early in the regular season played a role in his completing fewer than half of his passes during the campaign.  Those struggles resulted in a continuing cool relationship with Browns' fans, who booed him often during home contests.  Part of Ryan's decline can also be traced to the absence of second-year wide receiver Paul Warfield, who missed much of the season after suffering a double fracture of the collarbone in the team's first exhibition game./nIn 1966, he bounced back with a superb season, leading the league with 29 touchdown passes and finishing second with 2,976 yards despite playing with intense pain.  Ryan's output helped alleviate the absence of the legendary Jim Brown, who had retired prior to the start of training camp. His 29 touchdown passes in 14 games ranks second in Browns franchise history to Brian Sipe, who got 30 in a 16-game 1980 season.[4]/nOn January 25, 1967, Ryan underwent an operation to repair the remaining effects of his injury.  The surgery eliminated the pain, but also affected his throwing motion.  In the 1967 season opener, Ryan's injury woes continued as he sprained both ankles in a 21\u201314 loss to the Dallas Cowboys.  Battling through that malady, along with shoulder and knee troubles, Ryan led the team to a 9\u20135 record to reach the playoffs. The season would see Ryan suffering a concussion from a head-to-head collision with Dick Butkus. He was knocked out in the second-quarter but came back to throw three touchdown passes in the third quarter to will his team to a 24\u20130 victory. Ryan credits this collision for the cervical disc replacement he underwent after retiring./nRyan's tenure as the Browns' starting quarterback came to an abrupt end following a 1\u20132 start to the 1968 season.  Browns' head coach Blanton Collier replaced Ryan with Bill Nelsen, who went on to lead the team to a division title.  The official conclusion of Ryan's time with the Browns came on September 9, 1969, when he was released, but new Redskins' coach Vince Lombardi quickly signed Ryan as a backup./nDespite throwing only one pass during the 1969 season, Ryan returned for the last of his 13 years in the NFL in 1970 before officially announcing his retirement on April 13, 1971. With his accurate throwing arm, his 14.7 yards per completion still ranks as one of the all-time leaders.[4]/nRyan attended graduate school during the first part of his playing career, and in 1965, he earned his Ph.D. from Rice.[5] He worked for seven postgraduate years under G. R. MacLane, a leading geometric-function theorist, and produced the dissertation  \"Characterization of the Set of Asymptotic Values of a Function Holomorphic in the Unit Disc\".[3] In 1966, Ryan published two fundamental papers on the set of asymptotic values of a function holomorphic in the unit disc in Duke Mathematical Journal.[6]/nRyan received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1965.[7]/nRyan started teaching at Rice during his career and, during his time with the Browns, he became an assistant professor at the Case Institute of Technology in February 1967. Ryan had a full teaching load,[8] which includes undergraduate and graduate courses, and conducting research in complex analysis.[9][10] While at training camp, Ryan taught math in the morning and went to football practice in the afternoon.[11] Ryan taught his last course at Case Western Reserve in the spring of 1971. He was promoted to associate professor that summer. After taking a leave of absence for the next three years, he resigned his faculty position in 1974./nRyan learned computer programming and software through the Chi Corp., Case Western Reserve's then newly launched private computer company. He compiled advanced statistics to apply what he learned to football. The Browns were shown his results and liked the project but didn't offer the extra cash to move it forward.[3]/nRyan's second career was fodder for many jokes by sportswriters.  Red Smith wrote that the Browns' offense consisted of a quarterback who understood Einstein's theory of relativity and ten teammates who didn't know there was one.  Ryan was somewhat put off by the focus on his academic life, as he considered himself to be a regular football player./nRyan considered Sir Edward Collingwood, an expert in meromorphic function and the theory of cluster sets, and Arthur J. Lohwater, the former editor of Mathematical Reviews, as mentors.[12] Ryan had an Erd\u0151s number of 3.[13]/nSoon after his retirement from the Redskins, Ryan remained in the nation's capital when he was named director of information services for the U.S. House of Representatives. While there, he helped advance the computer age in politics by playing an integral role in establishing the body's first electronic voting system. This enabled voting procedures that usually ran for 45 minutes to be shortened to around 15 minutes. By the time he left the post, the office had an annual budget of $8 million with a staff of 225.[14]/nRyan resigned that post to become athletic director and lecturer in mathematics at Yale University on March 7, 1977. Ryan served in that position for ten years before resigning to become the school's associate vice president for institutional planning./nRyan was a member of the Rice board of governors from 1972 to 1976 and was recognized as a distinguished alumnus in 1987. Ryan became vice president for external affairs at Rice in August 1990, increasing annual gifts to the university to a three-year average of $32.8 million for the fiscal years 1992\u201394 from $21.4 million for the fiscal years 1988\u201390.

As a celebrated scholastic philosopher and doctor of theology, he is often called Doctor Profundus (medieval epithet, meaning \"the Profound Doctor\")./nSources vary about Bradwardine's early life before receiving his degree in 1321. His exact date of birth is unknown but sources point to a date between 1290 and 1300.[3] His place of birth is also unknown but some sources point to it being near Chichester, Sussex, or Harfield. The first concrete sources of his do not appear until he received his degree in 1321 from Balliol College, Oxford. Thomas Bradwardine became a Fellow of Merton College in Oxford, and was awarded his B.A. in August 1321. Bradwardine stayed at Merton College until 1333, when he was appointed Canon of Lincoln, and in 1337 he was appointed the chaplain of St Paul's Cathedral. His involvement with the ecclesiastical began in September 1333, when he was made the Canon of Lincoln,  it is less corroborated by sources but it is stated that Bradwardine may have been the Bishop of Durham between 1335 and 1337. It is rumoured that this move to Durham helped put him into contact with King Edward III, which would lead to his eventual appointment of Chaplain of Old St Paul's Cathedral in London.[4]/nHe acquired several degrees from Oxford, it is presumed he acquired them on these dates: B.A. by August 1321, an M.A. by 1323, a B.Th. by 133, and a D.Th. by 1348.[4]/nBradwardine was a precocious student, educated at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was a fellow by 1321; he took the degree of doctor of divinity, and acquired the reputation of a profound scholar, a skilful mathematician and an able theologian. He was also a gifted logician with theories on the insolubles and in particular the liar paradox./nBradwardine subsequently moved to Merton College, Oxford on a fellowship. He was afterwards raised to the high offices of chancellor of the university and professor of divinity. Bradwardine (like his contemporary William of Occam) was a culminating figure of the great intellectual movement at Oxford that had begun in the 1240s./nBradwardine helped revive Augustinian Theology during his time in the fourteenth century. Writing documents on several different subjects that included but were not limited too, speculative arithmetic, geometry, and memory of the human mind. Bradwardine would later write on and reject the belief the God is able to know future events and contingents to those events, rejecting William of Ockham's belief to the contrary. Bradwardine was a theologian along with his studies of natural philosophy. Accepting the idea of predestination, he suggested that all evil acts of [Human] will are due to God.[5] Stating that providence goes hand in hand with predestination theory, he rejected the idea that humans would be able to due any good on their own volition but rather they act according to God\u2019s will. Bradwardine would go on to write that free will and predestination theory are not mutually exclusive but rather that they can co-exist with each other, and do in fact co-exist in each other but only according to the will of God. This goes along with the theory of Augustinian Theology.[5]/nBradwardine was an ordinary secular cleric, which gave him intellectual freedom but deprived him of the security and wherewithal that the Preaching Orders would have afforded; instead he turned to royal patronage. From being chancellor of the diocese of London as Dean of St Paul's, he became chaplain and confessor to Edward III, whom he attended during his wars in France at the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy, where he preached at the victory Mass, and at the subsequent siege of Calais. Edward repeatedly entrusted him with diplomatic missions. On his return to England, he was successively appointed prebendary of Lincoln and dean (1348). In 1349 the canons of the chapter at Canterbury elected him Archbishop following the death of Archbishop John Stratford, but Edward III withheld his consent, preferring his chancellor John de Ufford, perhaps loth to lose his trusted confessor. After Ufford died of the Black Death, 2 May, Bradwardine went to receive confirmation from Pope Clement VI at Avignon, but on his return he died of the plague at Rochester[6] on 26 August 1349,[7] forty days after his consecration. He was buried at Canterbury./nChaucer in The Nun's Priest's Tale (line 476) ranks Bradwardine with Augustine and Boethius. His great theological work, to modern eyes, is a treatise against the Pelagians, entitled De causa Dei contra Pelagium et de virtute causarum. Bradwardine's major treatise argued that space was an infinite void in which God could have created other worlds, which he would rule as he ruled this one. The \"causes of virtue\" include the influences of the planets, not as predestining a human career, but influencing a subject's essential nature. This astrophysical treatise was not published until it was edited by Sir Henry Savile and printed in London, 1618; its circulation in manuscript was very limited. The implications of the infinite void were revolutionary; to have pursued them would have threatened the singular relationship of man and this natural world to God (Cantor 2001); in it he treated theology mathematically. He wrote also De Geometria speculativa (printed at Paris, 1530); De Arithmetica practica (printed at Paris, 1502); De proportionibus velocitatum in motibus (1328) (printed at Paris, 1495; Venice, 1505); De Quadratura Circuli (Paris, 1495); and an Ars Memorative, Sloane manuscripts. No. 3974 in the British Museum \u2013 earning from the Pope the title of the \u2018Profound Doctor\u2019. Another text, De Continuo is more tenuously credited to him and thought to be written sometime between 1328 and 1325./nMerton College sheltered a group of dons devoted to natural science, mainly physics, astronomy and mathematics, rivals of the intellectuals at the University of Paris. Bradwardine was one of these Oxford Calculators, studying mechanics with William Heytesbury, Richard Swineshead, and John Dumbleton. The Oxford Calculators distinguished kinematics from dynamics, emphasising kinematics, and investigating instantaneous velocity. They first formulated the mean speed theorem: a body moving with constant velocity travels the same distance as an accelerated body in the same time if its velocity is half the final speed of the accelerated body. They also demonstrated this theorem\u00a0\u2014 the foundation of \"The Law of Falling Bodies\"\u00a0\u2014 long before Galileo, who is generally credited with it./nThe mathematical physicist and historian of science Clifford Truesdell, wrote:[8]/nThe now published sources prove to us, beyond contention, that the main kinematical properties of uniformly accelerated motions, still attributed to Galileo by the physics texts, were discovered and proved by scholars of Merton college.... In principle, the qualities of Greek physics were replaced, at least for motions, by the numerical quantities that have ruled Western science ever since. The work was quickly diffused into France, Italy, and other parts of Europe. Almost immediately, Giovanni di Casale and Nicole Oresme found how to represent the results by geometrical graphs, introducing the connection between geometry and the physical world that became a second characteristic habit of Western thought .../nIn Tractatus de proportionibus (1328), Bradwardine extended the theory of proportions of Eudoxus of Cnidus to anticipate the concept of exponential growth, later developed by the Bernoulli and Euler, with compound interest as a special case. Arguments for the mean speed theorem (above) require the modern mathematical concept of limit, so Bradwardine had to use arguments of his day. Mathematician and mathematical historian Carl Benjamin Boyer writes, \"Bradwardine developed the Boethian theory of double or triple or, more generally, what we would call 'n-tuple' proportion\". Bradwardine attempted to reconcile contradictions in physics, where he largely adopted Aristotle's description of the physical universe.[9]/nBradwardine rejected four opinions concerning the link between power, resistance, and speed on the basis that were inconsistent with Aristotle's or because they did not align with what could be easily observed regarding motion.[10] He does this by examining the nature of ratios.[10] The first opinion Bradwardine contemplates before rejecting is one he attributes to Avempace that states \" that speeds follow the excesses of motive powers over resistances\", following the formula (V \u221d [M\u2212R], where V = speed M = motive power, and R = resistance).[10] he second opinion follows the formula (V \u221d [M\u2212R]/R), which states \"that speeds follow the ratio of the excesses of the motive over the resisting powers to the resisting powers\".[10] Bradwardine claims this as the work of Averroes.[10] The third opinion concerns the traditional interpretation of the Aristotelian rules of motion and states \"that the speeds follow the inverse of the resistances when the moving powers are the same (V \u221d 1/R when M is constant) and follow the moving powers when the resistances are the same (V \u221d M when R is constant)\".[11] His last rejection was \"that speeds do not follow any ratio because motive and resistive powers are quantities of different species and so cannot form ratios with each other\".[10] \"Bradwardine's own rule is that the ratio of speeds follows the ratios of motive to resistive powers.\"[10]/nBradwardine did identify one measurement error in Aristotle's law of motion.[12] Bradwardine's identification of this error was described by Ernest Moody as a \"radical shift from Aristotelian dynamics to modern dynamics, initiated in the early fourteenth century.\"[12] Aristotle's calculation of average speed was criticized by Bradwardine for not examining \"the whole question of how moment-to-moment velocities are related within the whole time of the movement.\"[12] Bradwardine also believed Aristotle contradicted himself with his explanation of resistance in motion.[12] Aristotle believed \"that a force has to be greater than its resistance in order to move, and the \"proportion\" (Bradwardine's word; we would say ratio) of force to resistance equaling the proportion of distance to time.\"[12] Bradwardine did not accept the explanation and instead proposed \"that the rate of velocity is the ratio of an exponential increase in force to resistance.\"[12] Bradwardine's explanation does not align with the modern rules of the rates of motion, yet his goal to reconcile Aristotle's claim was accomplished and he was the first person to be credited for using exponential functions in an attempt to explain the laws of motion.[12]/nBoyer also writes that \"the works of Bradwardine had contained some fundamentals of trigonometry gleaned from Muslim sources\".[13] Yet \"Bradwardine and his Oxford colleagues did not quite make the breakthrough to modern science\" (Cantor 2001, p.\u00a0122). Al-Kindi in particular seemed to influence Bradwardine, though it is unclear whether this was directly or indirectly. Nonetheless, Bradwardine's work bears many similarities to the work of Al-Kindi, Quia primos (or De Gradibus).[14] The most essential missing tool was calculus./nAl-Kindi in particular seemed to influence Bradwardine, though it is unclear whether this was directly or indirectly.[14] Gerard of Cremona's Latin translation of Quia primos (or De Gradibus) would have been available to Bradwardine, but Roger Bacon seemed to be the only European philosopher to have had a direct connection to the book, but not to the degree of Arnald of Villanova.[14] Nonetheless, Bradwardine's work bares many similarities to the work of Al-Kindi.[14]/nBradwardine was also a practitioner and exponent of the art of memory, a loosely associated group of mnemonic principles and techniques used to organise memory impressions, improve recall, and assist in the combination and 'invention' of ideas. His De Memoria Artificiali (c. 1335) discusses memory training current during his time.[15][16]/nBradwardine's On Acquiring a Trained Memory, translated by Mary Carruthers, contains, as Carruthers describes it, was similar to Cicero's work on the art of memory.[17] She states, \"Bradwardine's art is notable for its detailed description of several techniques for fixing and recalling specific material through the use of graphically detailed, brilliantly colored, and vigorously animated mental images, grouped together in a succession of pictures or organized scenes, whose internal order recalls not just particular content but the relationship among its parts.\"[17] She acknowledges this being similar to active imaging described by Cicero, along with the memory devices for things and words being changed in rhetoric, but are distinct since the imagery Bradwardine uses is decidedly medieval in nature.[17]/nBradwardine's theories on the insolubilia including the liar paradox were a great influence on the work of Jean Buridan.[18] Bradwardine's work on kinematics was also influential to Buridan.[19] Despite never rejecting the papacy, Thomas Bradwardine is cited as holding Reformation theology before Luther and Calvin.[20]/nHis De Causa Dei influenced the theology of John Wycliffe on grace and predestination.[21]", "53893197": "Anette E. \"Peko\" Hosoi is an American mechanical engineer, biophysicist, and mathematician, currently the Neil and Jane Pappalardo Professor of Mechanical Engineering and associate dean of engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[1]/nHosoi's research interests include fluid dynamics,  unconventional robotics, and bio-inspired design.[1][2] For instance, one of her projects developed a robot that moved like a snail by extruding artificial snail slime and rippling over it.[3]\nShe has also studied how razor clams turn sand into quicksand while digging themselves in,[4]\nand designed wetsuits using materials that mimic the thermal insulation properties of otter fur.[5]\nShe is the founder of a sports engineering program at MIT, which she started in 2011 after frustration at the performance of her cross-country bicycle on a downhill bicycling course.[6]/nHosoi was given her nickname \"Peko\" by her Japanese grandmother, because of her resemblance to Peko-chan, a girl depicted on the packaging for Fujiya Japanese candy.[1]\nShe studied physics at Princeton University and completed her doctorate in physics at the University of Chicago in 1997, under the joint supervision of Todd F.

(April 1536 \u2013 10 October 1586), born Pellegrino Rainaldi Danti, was an Italian Roman Catholic prelate, mathematician, astronomer, and cosmographer, who served as Bishop of Alatri (1583\u20131586).[1]/nDanti was born in Perugia in 1536 to a family of artists and scientists. As a boy he learned the rudiments of painting and architecture from his father Giulio, an architect and engineer who studied under Antonio da Sangallo, and his aunt Teodora,[2] who was said to have studied under the painter Perugino and also wrote a commentary on Euclid. His older brother Vincenzo Danti became one of the leading court sculptors of late-sixteenth-century Florence, while his younger brother Girolamo Danti (1547\u20131580) became a local painter./nDanti entered the Dominican Order on 7 March 1555, changing his baptismal name from Pellegrino to Ignazio. After completing his studies in philosophy and theology he spent some time preaching but soon devoted himself zealously to mathematics, astronomy, and geography.[2]/nIn 1562, he requested a transfer from the Dominican compound in Perugia to the monastery of San Marco in Florence. Soon after, he found work on the side tutoring the children of wealthy Florentines in mathematics and science. In September 1563, he was invited by Cosimo I, Duke of Tuscany to participate in his cosmographical project, the Guardaroba in the Palazzo Vecchio. Over the next dozen years, Danti painted 30 maps of regions of the world (based largely upon published prints by Giacomo Gastaldi, Abraham Ortelius, Gerardus Mercator, and others) upon the cabinet doors of the Guardaroba. He also worked on many other significant scientific and cosmographic projects in Florence, including the large terrestrial globe of the Guardaroba (1564\u20131568), and a number of brass scientific instruments (such as an astrolabe) today in the Museo Galileo in Florence. Between 1567 and 1569, Pius V, who belonged to the Dominicans, is said to have commissioned Danti to furnish plans for the construction of a Dominican church and convent at Bosco Marengo in Piedmont; Danti acted mainly as an adviser. During his stay in Florence, Danti taught mathematics[2] and published a number of scientific treatises, mostly commentaries on ancient and medieval astronomy and mathematics or explanations of how to use scientific instruments./nFor much of his time in Florence, Danti resided at the convent of Santa Maria Novella, and designed the quadrant and the armillary sphere that appear on the end blind arches of the lower facade of the church in 1572 and 1574, on the right and left respectively. He also designed a large-scale gnomon for the church which allowed a thin beam of light to enter the church at noon each day through a hole just beneath the facade's rose window,[3] although it probably was not completed by the time Danti left Florence./nIn 1574, Danti used his instruments to calculate the time of the March equinox, an important date for calculating the date of Easter. He discovered that it was 11 days out, falling on the 11 March rather than the 22 March, and he became a leading figure in proposing the reforms that lead to the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in 1582.[4]/nThere were also discussions between the Duke and Danti about building a canal to place Florence in communication with both the Mediterranean and the Adriatic. However, this ambitious plan was not started before Cosimo's death in 1574. In late September the following year, Cosimo's son, Grand Duke Francesco de' Medici, compelled Danti to leave Florence.[4] It is not known precisely why Francesco exiled Danti, but the Dominican had no trouble finding work or patrons anywhere else in Italy, although he never returned to Florence./nAfter leaving Florence, Danti became a professor of mathematics at the University of Bologna. While there he built a massive gnomon in the Bolognese church of San Petronio, the meridian line of which is still visible on the church's pavement.[citation needed] He also spent some time in Perugia, at the invitation of the governor, where he prepared maps of the Perugian republic./nOn account of his mathematical skills, Pope Gregory XIII invited him to Rome, appointed him pontifical mathematician and made him a member of the commission for the reform of the calendar.[4] He also placed him in charge of the painters whom the Pope had summoned to the Vatican to continue the decoration of the palace, most notably to make a number of maps of the regions of modern Italy in the newly constructed Gallery of Maps along the Cortile del Belvedere. This project, begun in early 1580 and completed about 18 months later, mapped the entirety of the Italian peninsula in 40 large-scale frescoes, each depicting a region as well as a perspective view of its most prominent city./nWhen the pontiff commissioned the architect Domenico Fontana to repair the Claudian harbour at Portus, it was Danti who furnished the necessary plans.[4] While at Rome Danti published a translation of a portion of Euclid with annotations and wrote a life of the architect Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola, preparing also notes for the latter's work on perspective. In 1583, in recognition of his work, Gregory made him Bishop of Alatri in the Campagna. He was appointed on 14 November 1583,[1] and consecrated as bishop on 30 November 1583 by Giovanni Antonio Facchinetti de Nuce, Patriarch of Jerusalem. with Giovanni Battista Santorio, Bishop of Alife, and Gerolamo Mazzarelli, Bishop of Nona, serving as co-consecrators./nDanti showed himself a zealous pastor in his new office.

He attained the rank of a royal building inspector and with his cousin Major Meno Burg they were the only men in the Prussian civil service who had not renounced their Jewish faith./nSachs was born in Berlin on 22 December 1772, the son of Lottery collector and Protected Jew Joel Jacob Sachs (born 30 July 1738 in Berlin; died 18 April 1820 in Berlin) and his second wife Esther Sachs (c.\u20091746 \u2013 1813).

He, the Christian, and I, the Jew, jointly took our oath of office into the hands of the legal adviser from the Upper building authority Mr. Troschel. At the same time we pronounced one and the same oath together, but with different closing formula. With regard to my, there was no mention of any Jewish scholar, of any Jewish witness, of any washing of hands, putting on the prayer robe etc., nor of any synagogue./nAt this time ruled Frederick William II. On 1 July 1794 Sachs obtained a patent as Ober-Hof-Bau-Conducteur and on 26 September 1799 he was appointed Ober-Hof-Bau-Inspector at the Oberhofbauamt. During his training, Dr. Johann Albert Eytelwein was also one of his teachers, to whom he dedicated his work Complete instruction in the manufacture of building hardware in 1827. As building inspector he took over the leadership of the building police in his department and the chairmanship of the examination commission of the master builders. Between 1790 and 1796, it was planned to use the land in the Molkenmarkt 1 area for the construction of the new city bailiwick. Projects were designed by members of the Oberhofbauamt and construction began in 1791 under the direction of Paul Ludwig Simon and Friedrich Gilly. Solomo Sachs had, not officially requested, designed two facades for this. These were the facades of the portal and the front on the Spree side, which the authority accepted very favourably, and for which he received his first public recognition. Since 1786 the Academy of Arts and Mechanical Science published the catalogue for the annual Academy exhibition. In the following years the biennial rhythm was introduced. The aim was to distinguish the Berlin public from the other academies in Kassel and Dresden. In the years 1786 to 1816, mainly architectural models and designs based on antique models took up space. A large proportion of the entries were submitted by academy students and younger Conducteuren. In 1794, Johann Carl Gottlieb Schlaetzer, Salomo Sachs, August Ferdinand Mandel (1771\u20131846), Johann Georg Moser and Paul Ludwig Simon were able to contribute their designs for churches, prisons, a playhouse, hunting lodge, country houses and town houses, summer houses and mortuaries to the exhibition and catalogue. In 1798 Sachs designed a mortuary for the Society of Friends (Gesellschaft der Freunde), but for financial reasons it was never executed. From 1799 to 1806 he taught as a drawing teacher for architecture and a teacher for machine drawings at the Bauakademie, which was newly founded by King Frederick William III. on 6 July 1799.[9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17]/nOn 21 September 1802 he married Henriette Isser from Hamburg in Berlin.

Here, the older and higher-ranking officials of the Collegium were in demand, for example Johann Heinrich Gentz. As a young civil servant, Solomo Sachs was so fascinated by this task that he worked out his own drawings, ideas and drafts in complete silence. He submitted them to his teacher, the privy councillor Becherer, who submitted the drawings for examination. Against all the specialists' magnificent drawings, his designs for the Palace Bridge and the New Guardhouse won the prize. The outbreak of war delayed the plans./nAfter the lost war, the financing of the Bauakademie and the Oberhofbauamt fell victim to the state austerity measures in favour of contributions to France and Sachs lost his job. He received waiting pay from the government from 1808 to 1816./nOnly after the end of the war was the plan resumed by Friedrich Schinkel, but now it was implemented with its adaptations. It was not until 1842 that Sachs noted in his autobiography that the new guardhous in particular resembled his basic designs, with the exception of Schinkel's masterly decoration of the building.[32]/n\"Here I cannot fail to point out how the basic features of the building complex up to the new guardhouse, as it stands there now, correspond to mine. At first I had put this building on aligned, not with the armoury but with the university. The peculiarity of my construction was that the fa\u00e7ade was actually formed by the rear front (high wall), in that the roof was to have its waste only towards the rear. In addition, two short side wings, connected by a Blinding-Masonry at the back and enclosing a small courtyard, were placed in such a way that the whole was a closed square. Finally, the fa\u00e7ade was decorated with 6 Doric columns and two pavilions on each side. I hope that nobody will take offence at the comparison I am making here between Schinkel's design and my earlier project of one and the same building, because I am not talking about Schinkel's elaborate decoration of the building, but only about the adaptation of the execution and the construction\"/nIn 1812, Sachs wrote the first complete Allgemeine Stra\u00dfen und Wohnungs-Anzeiger for the royal capital of Berlin. It was a groundbreaking work for future address books as well, and this masterpiece even found buyers abroad. The king ordered 4 copies and the State Chancellor Karl August Prince von Hardenberg ordered 12 copies. The police stations also ordered, as the map plans and addresses were very accurate. Unfortunately the beginning of the second French war prevented him from making a good financial living. However, the address book opened up another possibility, since the Privy Councillor Friedrich August von Staegemann, chairman of the finance party, was currently working on the organisation of the property tax, the idea of a flying cataster was born. Sachs opened an office to deal with this task, in order to gain control of the taxpayers with the least personnel. Berlin was thereby divided into 12 tax districts, with each district receiving information on changes in the residence of its citizens every day by means of a form and updated hourly. This is also how the first residents' registration offices came into being and police-relevant parts of the flying cadastre were set up and used at every police station in Berlin's residential city. The Privy Oberfinanzrat von Staegemann commissioned Sachs to make proposals to provide the state with income of several million talers through a suitable tax. His proposal led to the municipal tax that is still in force today and was first implemented as a Mieth tax./nIn 1813 the accommodation authority had to be reorganized, as Russian troops passing through had to be accommodated and fed by tenants and house owners. This represented an unbearable burden of war and many complaints were made about the state's ruthless distribution practices. On 15 March 1813, at the highest cabinet order of King Friedrich Wilhelm III, who was in Breslau, Silesia at the time, the entire Prussian territory between the Elbe and the Russian border was divided into four military governorates (1813\u20131815) for military strategic reasons of waging war against France. At the same time, the Oberregierungskommission in Berlin, which had been founded on 20 January 1813, was dissolved, as was the General Commission for Accommodation, Food and marching affairs (German General Kommission f\u00fcr das Einquartierung, Verpflegung und Marschwesen), which had been created on 24 April 1812.\nThe royal order to Berlin to establish the 1st Military Governorate between the Elbe and Oder rivers was given to Military Governor Lieutenant General Anton Wilhelm von L'Estocq and Civil Governor and Privy State Councillor Dr. Johann August Sack. They were to find suitable measures and solutions for the troops passing through and their quartering. This important authority entrusted Sachs with this task. He was assigned staff and assigned a room in the K\u00f6lln town hall, which he set up as an account office. There he and his colleagues were the contact persons for inquiries, complaints, claims and the development of a fair system of accommodation for the citizens.\nIn March 1813, the orders of magnitude to be handled amounted to 13300 soldiers and 4000 horses of the Russian military and 8100 soldiers and 1000 horses of the Prussian army every day. In July the maximum number of Prussian soldiers, 2000 prisoners and 5500 sick people reached 18000. Solomon had found the ingenious solution with a voucher system (paper money) that would be paid out at the end of the war. Everyone who reported within 24 hours of being billeted and handed in his billet for the quarter received these vouchers. This fair system could thus be installed, and Sachs and his many employees solved this task to everyone's satisfaction.[34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42]/nOn the basis of a specially-prepared expert opinion of 23 September 1815, for the Jewish community of Berlin, following damage caused by moisture to the dome of the Old Synagogue, Sachs had produced architectural drawings.\nOn 7 April 1816, Sachs asked the king for his reinstatement. This request was rejected on the basis of Prussian Jewish Edict \u00a79 of 1812. However, his second petition, dated 24 April 1816, led to success through the king, who allowed the exception to the rule, and through the announcement of the supreme cabinet order of 29 April 1816, by Cabinet Counsel Albrecht. At this time, Sachs lived at 49 Markgrafenstrasse and was a neighbor of Abraham Mendelssohn Bartholdy.[43][44]/nFrom 1816 to 1820 he worked as Country master builder for the Royal Government Marienwerder in West Prussia. From the laying of the foundation stone on 3 May 1818 until its ceremonial consecration on 3 August 1823, a Protestant church was built in Mewe according to plans by Schinkel, under the construction supervision of Sachs. In other church buildings in Stuhm and Marienwerder he was discriminated against by Protestant clergy anti-Semitic, which is why he built here as a Jew. He implemented Schinkel's designs despite all adversities. There were great difficulties in doing so, because the construction drawings of Schinkel were partly not understood or misinterpreted by Sachs' superior, the government and building official Balkow (1816\u20131825 building official in Marienwerder). In 1819, Salomo Sachs opened a Baugewerkschule in Marienwerder, which existed for 15 years until 1834. He took over the management and offered free lessons.[45][46][47]/nFrom 1820 to 1830 he was again, under his qualification, employed as Country master builder in the fourth building district at the Royal Government in Potsdam and was an employee of Karl Friedrich Schinkel. From 8 December 1820 Sachs was appointed to the examination commission for building craftsmen, and his area of responsibility here was the district of Spandau. At this time he lived at Spandauerstra\u00dfe 49 in the center of Berlin. On 3 December 1824 a so-called art road from Prenzlauer Tor to Heinersdorf was approved, it is today's Prenzlauer Allee. Sachs had done all the preliminary work here, including surveying, design, situation plan and cost planning. He brought together the most distinguished residents, who enabled him to do the necessary work financially. This group formed a public limited company, which, with the help of the government, put the project into practice. In 1825 Sachs began planning the new construction of the Fasanenmeisterhaus in the Tiergarten in its improved loam construction. The commission was given by the royal chief hunter Friedrich Detlev Graf von Moltke. (1750\u20131825). According to an expert opinion, issued by Friedrich Schinkel and Johann Carl Ludwig Schmid, on his rammed earth pis\u00e9 buildings, which was devastating for Sachs, he was unable to complete his work. Schinkel was commissioned by the Oberbaudeputat to execute the house in classical brick construction.\nThe animosity of the members of the Oberbaudeputation against Salomo Sachs increased further.\nAfter Sachs was crushed by the Oberbaudepartement with his plans for the new home of the pheasant hunter, he was commissioned by Wilhelm zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein to hand over his drawings and cost accounting, for comparison with Schinkel's designs. After the handover, his work disappeared forever, despite demands for restitution, and Sachs was not paid for his expenses until 17 years later. Despite these setbacks and insinuations, he continued to work on his reputation. In 1829 he was commissioned by the sons of Otto von Vo\u00df to Birkholz (Bernau near Berlin) to design and rebuild a new church tower. At the same time Carl Justus Heckmann for the roofing and Carl August Mencke for the gilding of the spire were also appointed to the building work. From 1829 to 1830, Sachs became increasingly disliked by the royal government and his superiors. He had been commissioned by the military, who were convinced of his cost-saving clay construction method, to build a cavalry horse stable in Charlottenburg. At the request of the military leadership, the construction was to take place very quickly and under his sole leadership without the participation of the royal government. This caused further tensions with his superiors, as the design in brick was already available.[48][49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56]/nWith his involuntary retirement in 1830, Salomo Sachs' career in the Prussian civil service came to an end. In June, he once again expressed his unbroken enthusiasm for his work with a design for a monument to Friedrich II. He was praised for this by his superiors.\nFrom then on, he devoted himself to his literary work, the restoration of his reputation and the validity of his improved pis\u00e9 building (through expert opinions)[57]/nIn honour of his 50th anniversary, scholars, architects, merchants, writers and friends gathered for lunch on 9 December 1842 in a daytime restaurant in Berlin.The room was decorated by the royal landscape and theater decoration painter Johann Karl Jakob Gerst (1792\u20131854) with the Portrait of Sachs under Flower garlands. Part of the table decoration had the shape of the Sloping Tower of Pisa, with the inscription \"Sachs' indestructible Pis\u00e9bau\".Among the dinner speakers and guests were community leader Joseph Lehmann, editor of the magazine for foreign literature, Dr. L\u00f6we as organizer of the festival and Prof. Wilhelm Stier. Stier had been trained by Solomon as a student of the Bauakademie in 1816 and they had become friends.  Another speaker was the writer, philosopher, bookseller and humorist Dr. Louis Weyl. (* 23 April 1817; \u2020 9 September 1851). With his humorous lecture on the arts, especially architecture, and a table song, he delighted the society.[58]\nOn 22 December 1842 Sachs celebrated his seventieth birthday.\nSachs' varied literary activities continued in 1844. His astronomical writings \u2013 Achsenparallelismus und Sonnensystem, i.e. parallelism of axes and the solar system, appeared in Berlin in 1850, but were not as successful. However, his two self-developed illustrative models for teaching, the \"Diagonon\" and the \"Cylindrical Ellipto-Tellurium\", are to be praised. In 1845, Solomon wrote a pamphlet On the existence of air and water pressure, which was directed against Friedrich Johann von Drieberg.[59][60][61][62][63][64][65]/nAn article in the Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums of 26 June 1847 once again demonstrates the efforts of Solomon Sachs, even at the high age of 75, that Jewish emancipation continued to be a current topic for him./nA controversial statement by the Landtag commissioner Minister Ernst von Bodelschwingh the Elder, during the discussion of the Prussian Jewish Law of 1847 at a city council meeting, led to a retrospective encounter with Sachs./nSome people had wrongly assumed that here in Berlin a Jewish building inspector had once existed./nHe drove to the hotel of the Ministry of the Interior and waited for the minister there to hand over his biography with picture and signature as a souvenir.\nBodelschwingh thanked him and asked him whether he had remained true to the Jewish faith and received a pension from the state./nHowever, but so small that I cannot really blame Your Honourable Excellency if you doubted my existence./nOn 25 July 1848, the constituent Prussian National Assembly met at its 32nd session in the rooms of the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin.

In 1887 he received his PhD (\u00dcber lineare homogene Differentialgleichungen vierter Ordnung, zwischen deren Integralen homogene Relationen h\u00f6heren als ersten Grades bestehen.) His thesis advisors were Lazarus Immanuel Fuchs and Leopold Kronecker. In 1889 he became an associate professor at Berlin; in 1897 an invited professor in Bonn and in the same year, a full professor at the University of Kolozsv\u00e1r, Hungary (now Cluj, Romania). From 1911 he was professor at the University of Giessen, where he taught until 1930. His daughter Hildegard Lewy (1903\u20131969), became an Assyriologist and academic. In 1933 he was forced to retire by the Nazis. He died shortly afterwards.[2] His doctoral students include Abraham Plessner./nSchlesinger was a historian of science. He wrote an article on the function theory of Carl Friedrich Gauss and translated Ren\u00e9 Descartes' La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie into German (1894). He was one of the organizers of the celebrations for the hundredth anniversary of J\u00e1nos Bolyai and from 1904 to 1909 with R. Fuchs he collected the works of his teacher Lazarus Fuchs, who was also his father-in-law. In 1902 he became a corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. In 1909 he received the Lobachevsky Prize.[3]/nFrom 1929 until his death he was co-editor of Crelle's Journal./nLike his teacher Fuchs, he worked primarily on linear ordinary differential equations. His two-volume Handbuch der Theorie der Linearen Differentialgleichungen was published from 1895 to 1898 in Teubner in Leipzig (Vol.2 in two parts).[4] He also published Einf\u00fchrung in die Theorie der gew\u00f6hnlichen Differentialgleichungen auf funktionentheoretischer Grundlage (Auflage, 1922), Vorlesungen \u00fcber lineare Differentialgleichungen (1908)[5] and Automorphe Funktionen (Gruyter, 1924). In 1909 he wrote a long report for the annual report of the German Mathematical Society on the history of linear differential equations since 1865.[6] He also studied differential geometry, and wrote a book of lectures on Albert Einstein's general relativity theory.[7]/nToday, his best known work is \u00dcber eine Klasse von Differentialsystemen beliebiger Ordnung mit festen kritischen Punkten (Crelle's Journal, 1912). There he considered the problem of isomonodromy deformations for a certain matrix Fuchsian equation; this is a special case of Hilbert's 21st Problem (existence of differential equations with prescribed monodromy). The paper introduced what are today called Schlesinger transformations and Schlesinger equations./nThe article was created as a translation (by Google) of the corresponding article in German Wikipedia.", "71161982": "Orymbek Akhmetbekovich Zhautykov (1 May 1911 \u2013 15 May 1989) was a Kazakh mathematician.[1] His mathematical work focussed on stability theory of motion, equations which govern physics and infinite systems of differential equations.[2] Throughout his life he published many different pieces of work including research papers, textbooks and biographies of mathematicians on their birth/death anniversaries.[1]/nZhautykov was born in Village Number 2, Kounrad District of the Karaganda Region, USSR (Present Day Aktogay District, Karagdanda, Kazakhstan) on 1 May 1911.[3] Orymbek learned how to read the Russian language and became intrigued by it at a young age. This interest of language allowed Orymbek to attend a school in the Deresin region where he would be introduced to mathematics. Zhautykov would achieve magnificent results at the school which would earn him a place at a prestigious school in Karkaralinsk. He graduated from this school in 1930. Orymbek would then go on to study in the Mathematics and Physics schools of the Kazakh Pedagogical University and would attain a first-class degree in mathematics in 1934. During these years Orymbek would be sent out to work at farms in the Zhana-Arka region as well as working on the construction of a mine and the Kargres hydroelectric station. This was part of the First five-year plan.[1][3][4]/nIn 1934 Zhautykov became an assistant in the Maths department of the Kazakh Pedagogical University. As assistant this allowed Zhautykov to begin his mathematical research. Additionally, due to the university's link to Leningrad State University, Zhautykov registered as an external student in the Leningrad Research Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. Through this connection Zhautykov would travel to Leningrad to undertake work with his supervisor Isidor Pavlovich Natanson. But the Eastern Front would halt his studies in 1941, which forced him back to the Kazah Pedagogical University in Almaty where he would work with Konstantin Petrovich Persidsky. Here he would publish the thesis Some questions of the theory of stability of motion in the sense of Lyapunov. This thesis studied the work on stability of solutions for systems of differential equations by Lyapunov. Orymbek was the Dean of the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics at the university from 1941 to 1943.[3][4]/nIn 1945 Zhautykov and a group of fellow Kazakh scientists, led by Kanysh Satbayev, travelled to Moscow to reimagine the USSR Academy of Sciences for the Kazakh region. This included suggestions for more staffing in the Academy of Sciences of the Kazakh SSR. Whilst on the trip to the USSR, Zhautykov visited Leningrad as well as Moscow where he met fellow mathematicians, including Vladimir Smirnov and Leonid Kantorovich,[3]  and introduced areas of science which the new academy in Kazakhstan would focus on. Having intrigued and excited other scientists, Zhautykov's propositions gathered a lot of support. On 25 October 1945 the academy gained founding approval from the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR. The Academy of Sciences of the Kazakh SSR began operating on 1 June 1946, where Zhautykov was appointed a senior researcher. Five years later, Zhautykov was appointed as the head of the Mathematics and Mechanics department.[3]/nZhautykov would work as a senior researcher from 1951 to 1965[5] during which he wrote many pieces of mathematical works mainly focussing on the stability and solutions of differential equations/systems of differential equations. In addition to this Zhautykov would write mathematical biographies commemorating the birthdays or deaths of mathematicians. Zhautykov's first in this series would be on Lyapunov, whose work he had focussed on for his earlier thesis.[1][3]/nIn 1958 he wrote one of the most advanced Kazakh-language textbooks on analysis for the time, giving access to mathematical resources at a level which was not readily available to Kazakh speaking students.[6]/nZhautykov would also publish many papers on solutions and uniqueness of solutions of infinite systems of differential equations. In 1961 Zhautykov received a Doctorate for his thesis Study of infinite systems of differential equations (Russian). Defending his thesis, Zhautykov became a professor. On 29 May 1962 he was given the title of an academician of the Academy of Sciences of the Kazakh SSR. Through his dedication to the study of differential equations he headed the Laboratory of Differential Equations from 1965 to 1987.[3]/nZhautykov would hold senior roles at the Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics of the Academy of Sciences of the Kazah SSR and in the Department of Physics and Mathematics in the years 1965\u20131985.[5][3]    For the book Infinite Systems of Differential Equations (co-written by Professor K.G. Valeev in 1974) Zhautykov was given the title Laureate of the State Prize of the Kazakh SSR (science and technology)[6]/nZhautykov was awarded two Order of the Badge of Honour medals in 1945 as well as one in 1971. In 1981 Orymbek was awarded the Order of the October Revolution.[3][6]/nFrom 1985 to 1989 Orymbek held a head position at the Academy of Sciences of Kazakhstan[2] until his death on 15 May 1989 in Almaty.[3][6]/nKazakhstan commemorated the 100th year since his birth by publishing a commemorative stamp picturing him on it.[1] An annual mathematics competition is also named after him; The International Zhautykov Olympiad in Mathematics (IZhO). A school of physics and mathematics as well as a secondary school in Karakaralinsk were named in honour of Orymbek.

Pesin is currently a Distinguished Professor in the Department of Mathematics and the Director of the Anatole Katok Center for Dynamical Systems and Geometry at the Pennsylvania State University (PSU). His primary areas of research are the theory of dynamical systems with an emphasis on smooth ergodic theory, dimension theory in dynamical systems, and Riemannian geometry, as well as mathematical and statistical physics./nPesin became interested in mathematics in school but his real involvement began when he entered the boarding school with emphasis on teaching physics and mathematics that was organized by Andrei Kolmogorov. Following his graduation of the school (with honors) in 1965, he successfully passed entry exams to the Department of Mechanics and Mathematics (or \"Mech-Mat\") of Moscow State University. Pesin graduated from Moscow State University (also with honors) in 1970, receiving a master's degree in mathematics. His master thesis advisor was Yakov Sinai./nPesin naturally wanted to pursue a PhD in mathematics but faced significant challenges due to the oppressive nature and anti-Semitic policies of the Soviet regime. Thus, he was not permitted to continue his study at the university graduate school and was subsequently assigned to work at a research institute in Moscow (for a more complete historical account of the anti-Semitic sentiment in the Soviet mathematics establishment during this period see the article).[1]/nSince Pesin always dreamed to be a \"pure\" mathematician, under the circumstances, he chose to combine his work at the institute with his after-hours research in mathematics and within a few years after graduation, he made a number of outstanding breakthroughs in the theory of smooth dynamical systems. His research at this time was conducted under the supervision of his PhD advisor, Dmitry Anosov, and also Anatole Katok./nIn 1989 Pesin immigrated to the United States with his family. He first worked as a visiting Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Chicago before getting the position of Full Professor at Penn State University. In 2003 Pesin received the title of Distinguished Professor of mathematics./nYakov Pesin is married to Natasha Pesin who while in Russia worked for several years as a senior editor in the division of mathematics at the \"Prosvechenie\" (\"Education\") Publishing House in Moscow. After moving to the US she started a new career as a ceramicist (see her artworks at www.natashapesin.com)./nYakov Pesin also has two daughters, Elena and Irina who reside in the US./nYakov Pesin is famous for several fundamental discoveries in the theory of dynamical systems (relevant references can be found on Pesin's website)./n1) In a joint work with Michael Brin  \"Flows of frames on manifolds of negative curvature\" (Russian Math. Surveys, 1973), Pesin laid down the foundations of partial hyperbolicity theory. As an application, they studied ergodic properties of the frame flows on manifolds of negative curvature.[2] In a later work with Yakov Sinai \"Gibbs measures for partially hyperbolic attractors\" (Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems, 1983) Pesin constructed a special class of u-measures for partially hyperbolic systems which are a direct analog in this setting of the famous Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen (SRB) measures./n2) Pesin's greatest contribution to dynamics is creation of non-uniform hyperbolicity theory, which is commonly known as Pesin Theory.[3][4][5] This theory serves as the mathematical foundation for the principal phenomenon known as \"deterministic chaos\" \u2013 the appearance of highly irregular chaotic motions in completely deterministic dynamical systems. Among the highlights of this theory is the formula for the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of the system (also known as Pesin entropy formula). His main article on this topic \"Characteristic Lyapunov exponents and smooth ergodic theory\" (Russian Mathematical Surveys, 1977) has a very high number of citations in mathematical literature and beyond (in physics, biology, etc.)./n3) Pesin's later work on non-uniform hyperbolicity includes establishing presence of systems with non-zero Lyapunov exponents on any manifold; a proof of the Eckmann\u2014Ruelle conjecture; the study of the essential coexistence phenomenon of regular and chaotic dynamics; constructions of SRB measures for hyperbolic attractors with singularities, partially hyperbolic and non-uniformly hyperbolic attractors; and effecting thermodynamic formalism for some classes of non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems./n4) Pesin designed a construction (known also as the Caratheodory-Pesin construction) that allows one to introduce and study various dimension-type characteristics of dynamical systems. Among other things his work reveals \"dimension nature\" of many of the well-known thermodynamics invariants such as metric and topological entropies and topological pressure. It also provides a unified approach to describe various dimension spectra and related multi-fractal formalism (see [6])./n5) Pesin's work in Mathematical Physics includes the study of Coupled Map Lattices associated with infinite chains of hyperbolic systems as well as the ones generated by some diffusion-type PDEs such as FitzHu-Nagumo and Belousov-Zhabotinsky equations./nYakov Pesin holds a tenured faculty position at the Pennsylvania State University, where he has advised numerous PhD students on their thesis. In addition to his regular teaching responsibilities, he designed and taught courses at the special MASS (Mathematics Advanced Study Semester) program on Dynamical Systems[7] and Analytic and Projective Geometry. He has also delivered mini-courses at numerous International Mathematical Schools./nIn 1986 Yakov Pesin was invited to speak at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in Berkeley, CA, but Soviet authorities did not allow him to travel to the US. Nevertheless, his talk on \"Ergodic properties and dimension-like characteristics of strange attractors that are close to hyperbolic\" was published in the proceedings of the ICM in 1987./nIn 2012 Yakov Pesin became a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society (in its inaugural class) and in 2019 he was elected a (foreign) member of the European Academy\u2014Academia Europaea.

In fact, some regard John Tukey as the father of data science. At the very least, he pioneered many of the key foundations of what came later to be known as data science. [12]/nMaking sense of data has a long history and has been addressed by statisticians, mathematicians, scientists, and others for many many years. During the 1960s, Tukey challenged the dominance at the time of what he called \"confirmatory data analysis\", statistical analyses driven by rigid mathematical configurations.[13] Tukey emphasized the importance of having a more flexible attitude towards data analysis and of exploring data carefully to see what structures and information might be contained therein. He called this \"exploratory data analysis\" (EDA). In many ways, EDA was a precursor to data science./nTukey also realized the importance of computer science to EDA. Graphics are an integral part of EDA methodology and, while much of Tukey's work focused on static displays (such as box plots) that could be drawn by hand, he realized that computer graphics would be much more effective for studying multivariate data. PRIM-9, the first program for viewing multivariate data, was conceived by him during the early 1970s.[14]/nThis coupling of data analysis and computer science is what is now called data science./nTukey articulated the important distinction between exploratory data analysis and confirmatory data analysis, believing that much statistical methodology placed too great an emphasis on the latter. Though he believed in the utility of separating the two types of analysis, he pointed out that sometimes, especially in natural science, this was problematic and termed such situations uncomfortable science./nA. D. Gordon offered the following summary of Tukey's principles for statistical practice:[15]/n... the usefulness and limitation of mathematical statistics; the importance of having methods of statistical analysis that are robust to violations of the assumptions underlying their use; the need to amass experience of the behaviour of specific methods of analysis in order to provide guidance on their use; the importance of allowing the possibility of data's influencing the choice of method by which they are analysed; the need for statisticians to reject the role of \"guardian of proven truth\", and to resist attempts to provide once-for-all solutions and tidy over-unifications of the subject; the iterative nature of data analysis; implications of the increasing power, availability, and cheapness of computing facilities; the training of statisticians./nTukey's lectures were described to be unusual. McCullagh described his lecture given in London in 1977:[15][16]/nTukey ambled to the podium, a great bear of a man dressed in baggy pants and a black knitted shirt. These might once have been a matching pair but the vintage was such that it was hard to tell. ... Carefully and deliberately a list of headings was chalked on the blackboard. The words came too, not many, like overweight parcels, delivered at a slow unfaltering pace. ... When it was complete, Tukey turned to face the audience and the podium ... \"Comments, queries, suggestions?\" he asked the audience ... As he waited for a response, he clambered onto the podium and manoeuvred until he was sitting cross-legged facing the audience. ... We in the audience sat like spectators at the zoo waiting for the great bear to move or say something. But the great bear appeared to be doing the same thing, and the feeling was not comfortable./nWhile working with John von Neumann on early computer designs, Tukey introduced the word bit as a portmanteau of binary digit.[17] The term bit was first used in an article by Claude Shannon in 1948.", "66115813": "Kirsten Anna Morris (born 1960)[1] is a Canadian applied mathematician specializing in control theory, including work on flexible structures, smart materials, hysteresis, and infinite-dimensional optimization.[2] She is a professor at the University of Waterloo, the former chair of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Activity Group on Control and Systems, the author of two books on control theory, and an IEEE Fellow./nMorris was motivated to study mathematical economics at Queen's University at Kingston by a job doing econometrics at a bank, but lost interest in the economic applications of mathematics after a year, instead switching into a program in mathematics and engineering,[2] which she finished in 1982.[3] She became interested in control theory while studying for a master's degree at the University of Waterloo.[2] After completing the degree in 1984, she continued at Waterloo as a doctoral student, and earned her Ph.D. there in 1989.[3] Her dissertation, Finite-Dimensional Control of Infinite-Dimensional Systems, was supervised by Mathukumalli Vidyasagar.[3][4]/nAfter a year as a staff scientist at the NASA Langley Research Center, she returned to Waterloo as an assistant professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics in 1990.

He remains an external scientific member of the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics./nHuisken's PhD students include Ben Andrews and Simon Brendle, among over twenty-five others./nHuisken's work deals with partial differential equations, differential geometry, and their applications in physics. Numerous phenomena in mathematical physics and geometry are related to surfaces and submanifolds. A dominant theme of Huisken's work has been the study of the deformation of such surfaces, in situations where the rules of deformation are determined by the geometry of those surfaces themselves. Such processes are governed by partial differential equations./nHuisken's contributions to mean curvature flow are particularly fundamental. Through his work, the mean curvature flow of hypersurfaces in various convex settings is largely understood. His discovery of Huisken's monotonicity formula, valid for general mean curvature flows, is a particularly important tool./nIn the mathematical study of general relativity, Huisken and Tom Ilmanen (ETH Zurich) were able to prove a significant special case of the Riemannian Penrose inequality. Their method of proof also made a decisive contribution to the inverse mean curvature flow. Hubert Bray later proved a more general version of their result with alternative methods. The general version of the conjecture, which is about black holes or apparent horizons in Lorentzian geometry, is still an open problem (as of 2020)./nHuisken was one of the first authors to consider Richard Hamilton's work on the Ricci flow in higher dimensions.[1] In 1985, Huisken published a version of Hamilton's analysis in arbitrary dimensions, in which Hamilton's assumption of the positivity of Ricci curvature is replaced by a quantitative closeness to constant curvature.[H85] This is measured in terms of the Ricci decomposition. Almost all of Hamilton's main estimates, particularly the gradient estimate for scalar curvature and the eigenvalue pinching estimate, were put by Huisken into the context of general dimensions./nSeveral years later, the validity of Huisken's convergence theorems were extended to broader curvature conditions via new algebraic ideas of Christoph B\u00f6hm and Burkhard Wilking. In a major application of B\u00f6hm and Wilking's work, Brendle and Richard Schoen established a new convergence theorem for Ricci flow, containing the long-conjectured differentiable sphere theorem as a special case./nHuisken is widely known for his foundational work on the mean curvature flow of hypersurfaces. In 1984, he adapted Hamilton's seminal work on the Ricci flow to the setting of mean curvature flow, proving that a normalization of the flow which preserves surface area will deform any smooth closed convex hypersurface of Euclidean space into a round sphere.[H84] The major difference between his work and Hamilton's is that, unlike in Hamilton's work, the relevant equation in the proof of the \"pinching estimate\" is not amenable to the maximum principle. Instead, Huisken made use of iterative integral methods, following earlier work of the analysts Ennio De Giorgi and Guido Stampacchia. In analogy with Hamilton's result, Huisken's results can be viewed as providing proofs that any smooth closed convex hypersurface of Euclidean space is diffeomorphic to a sphere, and is the boundary of a region which is diffeomorphic to a ball. However, both of these results are elementary via analysis of the Gauss map./nLater, Huisken extended the calculations in his proof to consider hypersurfaces in general Riemannian manifolds.[H86] His result says that if the hypersurface is sufficiently convex relative to the geometry of the Riemannian manifold, then the mean curvature flow will contract it to a point, and that a normalization of surface area in geodesic normal coordinates will give a smooth deformation to a sphere in Euclidean space (as represented by the coordinates). This shows that such hypersurfaces are diffeomorphic to the sphere, and that they are the boundary of a region in the Riemannian manifold which is diffeomorphic to a ball. In this generality, there is not a simple proof using the Gauss map./nIn 1987, Huisken adapted his methods to consider an alternative \"mean curvature\"-driven flow for closed hypersurfaces in Euclidean space, in which the volume enclosed by the surface is kept constant; the result is directly analogous.[H87] Later, in collaboration with Shing-Tung Yau, this work was extended to Riemannian settings.[HY96] The corresponding existence and convergence result of Huisken\u2013Yau illustrates a geometric phenomena of manifolds with positive ADM mass, namely that they are foliated by surfaces of constant mean curvature. With a corresponding uniqueness result, they interpreted this foliation as a measure of center of mass in the theory of general relativity./nFollowing work of Yoshikazu Giga and Robert Kohn which made extensive use of the Dirichlet energy as weighted by exponentials, Huisken proved in 1990 an integral identity, known as Huisken's monotonicity formula, which shows that, under the mean curvature flow, the integral of the \"backwards\" Euclidean heat kernel over the evolving hypersurface is always nonincreasing.[2][3][H90] He later extended his formula to allow for general codimension and general positive solutions of the \"backwards\" heat equation; the monotonicity in this generality crucially uses Richard Hamilton's matrix Li\u2013Yau estimate.[H93][4] An extension to the Riemannian setting was also given by Hamilton.[5] Huisken and Hamilton's ideas were later adapted by Grigori Perelman to the setting of the \"backwards\" heat equation for volume forms along the Ricci flow.[6]/nHuisken and Klaus Ecker made repeated use of the monotonicity result to show that, for a certain class of noncompact graphical hypersurfaces in Euclidean space, the mean curvature flow exists for all positive time and deforms any surface in the class to a self-expanding solution of the mean curvature flow.[EH89] Such a solution moves only by constant rescalings of a single hypersurface. Making use of maximum principle techniques, they were also able to obtain purely local derivative estimates, roughly paralleling those earlier obtained by Wan-Xiong Shi for Ricci flow.[7][EH91]/nGiven a finite-time singularity of the mean curvature flow, there are several ways to perform microscopic rescalings to analyze the local geometry in regions near points of large curvature. Based on his monotonicity formula, Huisken showed that many of these regions, specifically those known as type I singularities, are modeled in a precise way by self-shrinking solutions of the mean curvature flow.[H90]/nThere is now a reasonably complete understanding of the rescaling process in the setting of mean curvature flows which only involve hypersurfaces whose mean curvature is strictly positive. Following provisional work by Huisken, Tobias Colding and William Minicozzi have shown that (with some technical conditions) the only self-shrinking solutions of mean curvature flow which have nonnegative mean curvature are the round cylinders, hence giving a complete local picture of the type I singularities in the \"mean-convex\" setting.[H90][H93][8] In the case of other singular regions, known as type II singularities, Richard Hamilton developed rescaling methods in the setting of Ricci flow which can be transplanted to the mean curvature flow.[9] By modifying the integral methods he developed in 1984, Huisken and Carlo Sinestrari carried out an elaborate inductive argument on the elementary symmetric polynomials of the second fundamental form to show that any singularity model resulting from such rescalings must be a mean curvature flow which moves by translating a single convex hypersurface in some direction.[HSS99a][HS99b] This passage from mean-convexity to full convexity is comparable with the much easier Hamilton\u2013Ivey estimate for Ricci flow, which says that any singularity model of a Ricci flow on a closed 3-manifold must have nonnegative sectional curvature./nIn the 1970s, the physicists Robert Geroch, Pong-Soo Jang, and Robert Wald developed ideas connecting the asymptotic behavior of inverse mean curvature flow to the validity of the Penrose conjecture, which relates the energy of an asymptotically flat spacetime to the size of the black holes it contains.[10][11] This can be viewed as a sharpening or quantification of the positive energy theorem, which provides the weaker statement that the energy is nonnegative./nIn the 1990s, Yun Gang Chen, Yoshikazu Giga, and Shun'ichi Goto, and independently Lawrence Evans and Joel Spruck, developed a theory of weak solutions for mean curvature flow by considering level sets of solutions of a certain elliptic partial differential equation.[12][13] Tom Ilmanen made progress on understanding the theory of such elliptic equations, via approximations by elliptic equations of a more standard character.[14] Huisken and Ilmanen were able to adapt these methods to the inverse mean curvature flow, thereby making the methodology of Geroch, Jang, and Wald mathematically precise. Their result deals with noncompact three-dimensional Riemannian manifolds-with-boundary of nonnegative scalar curvature whose boundary is minimal, relating the geometry near infinity to the surface area of the largest boundary component.[HI01] Hubert Bray, by making use of the positive mass theorem instead of the inverse mean curvature flow, was able to improve Huisken and Ilmanen's inequality to involve the total surface area of the boundary.[15]/nHuisken is a fellow of the Heidelberg Academy for Sciences and Humanities, the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities, the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, and the American Mathematical Society.[16]", "65001711": "Marjorie Blake (Marj) Batchelor-Winter is an American mathematician known for her work on coalgebras and supermanifolds.

Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the \"second great unification in physics\"[3] where the first one had been realised by Isaac Newton./nWith the publication of \"A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field\" in 1865, Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light.  He proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.[4] The unification of light and electrical phenomena led to his prediction of the existence of radio waves. Maxwell is also regarded as a founder of the modern field of electrical engineering.[5]/nMaxwell was the first to derive the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution, a statistical means of describing aspects of the kinetic theory of gases, which he worked on sporadically throughout his career.[6] He is also known for presenting the first durable colour photograph in 1861 and for his foundational work on analysing the rigidity of rod-and-joint frameworks (trusses) like those in many bridges. He is responsible for modern dimensional analysis.[7][8] Maxwell is also recognized for laying the groundwork for chaos theory.[9][10]/nHis discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as special relativity and quantum mechanics. Many physicists regard Maxwell as the 19th-century scientist having the greatest influence on 20th-century physics. His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein.[11] In the millennium poll\u2014a survey of the 100 most prominent physicists\u2014Maxwell was voted the third greatest physicist of all time, behind only Newton and Einstein.[12] On the centenary of Maxwell's birthday, Einstein described Maxwell's work as the \"most profound and the most fruitful that physics has experienced since the time of Newton\".[13] Einstein, when he visited the University of Cambridge in 1922, was told by his host that he had done great things because he stood on Newton's shoulders; Einstein replied: \"No I don't. I stand on the shoulders of Maxwell.\"[14] Tom Siegfried described Maxwell as \"one of those once-in-a-century geniuses who perceived the physical world with sharper senses than those around him\".[15]/nJames Clerk Maxwell was born on 13 June 1831[16] at 14 India Street, Edinburgh, to John Clerk Maxwell of Middlebie, an advocate, and Frances Cay,[17][18] daughter of Robert Hodshon Cay and sister of John Cay. (His birthplace now houses a museum operated by the James Clerk Maxwell Foundation.) His father was a man of comfortable means[19] of the Clerk family of Penicuik, holders of the baronetcy of Clerk of Penicuik. His father's brother was the 6th baronet.[20] He had been born \"John Clerk\", adding \"Maxwell\" to his own after he inherited (as an infant in 1793) the Middlebie estate, a  Maxwell property in Dumfriesshire.[17] James was a first cousin of both the artist Jemima Blackburn[21] (the daughter of his father's sister) and the civil engineer William Dyce Cay (the son of his mother's brother). Cay and Maxwell were close friends and Cay acted as his best man when Maxwell married.[22]/nMaxwell's parents met and married when they were well into their thirties;[23] his mother was nearly 40 when he was born. They had had one earlier child, a daughter named Elizabeth, who died in infancy.[24]/nWhen Maxwell was young his family moved to Glenlair, in Kirkcudbrightshire, which his parents had built on the estate which comprised 1,500 acres (610\u00a0ha).[25] All indications suggest that Maxwell had maintained an unquenchable curiosity from an early age.[26] By the age of three, everything that moved, shone, or made a noise drew the question: \"what's the go o' that?\"[27] In a passage added to a letter from his father to his sister-in-law Jane Cay in 1834, his mother described this innate sense of inquisitiveness:/nHe is a very happy man, and has improved much since the weather got moderate; he has great work with doors, locks, keys, etc., and \"show me how it doos\" is never out of his mouth. He also investigates the hidden course of streams and bell-wires, the way the water gets from the pond through the wall....[28]/nRecognising the boy's potential, Maxwell's mother Frances took responsibility for his early education, which in the Victorian era was largely the job of the woman of the house.[29] At eight he could recite long passages of John Milton and the whole of the 119th psalm (176 verses). Indeed, his knowledge of scripture was already detailed; he could give chapter and verse for almost any quotation from the psalms. His mother was taken ill with abdominal cancer and, after an unsuccessful operation, died in December 1839 when he was eight years old. His education was then overseen by his father and his father's sister-in-law Jane, both of whom played pivotal roles in his life.[29] His formal schooling began unsuccessfully under the guidance of a 16-year-old hired tutor. Little is known about the young man hired to instruct Maxwell, except that he treated the younger boy harshly, chiding him for being slow and wayward.[29] The  tutor was dismissed in November 1841. James' father took him to Robert Davidson's demonstration of electric propulsion and magnetic force on 12 February 1842, an experience with profound implications for the boy.[30]/nMaxwell was sent to the prestigious Edinburgh Academy.[31] He lodged during term times at the house of his aunt Isabella. During this time his passion for drawing was encouraged by his older cousin Jemima.[32] The 10-year-old Maxwell, having been raised in isolation on his father's countryside estate, did not fit in well at school.[33] The first year had been full, obliging him to join the second year with classmates a year his senior.[33] His mannerisms and Galloway accent struck the other boys as rustic. Having arrived on his first day of school wearing a pair of homemade shoes and a tunic, he earned the unkind nickname of \"Daftie\".[34] He never seemed to resent the epithet, bearing it without complaint for many years.[35] Social isolation at the Academy ended when he met Lewis Campbell and Peter Guthrie Tait, two boys of a similar age who were to become notable scholars later in life. They remained lifelong friends.[17]/nMaxwell was fascinated by geometry at an early age, rediscovering the regular polyhedra before he received any formal instruction.[32] Despite his winning the school's scripture biography prize in his second year, his academic work remained unnoticed[32] until, at the age of 13, he won the school's mathematical medal and first prize for both English and poetry.[36]/nMaxwell's interests ranged far beyond the school syllabus and he did not pay particular attention to examination performance.[36] He wrote his first scientific paper at the age of 14. In it he described a mechanical means of drawing mathematical curves with a piece of twine, and the properties of ellipses, Cartesian ovals, and related curves with more than two foci. The work,[17][37] of 1846, \"On the description of oval curves and those having a plurality of foci\" [38] was presented to the Royal Society of Edinburgh by James Forbes, a professor of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh,[17][37] because Maxwell was deemed too young to present the work himself.[39] The work was not entirely original, since Ren\u00e9 Descartes had also examined the properties of such multifocal ellipses in the 17th century, but Maxwell had simplified their construction.[39]/nMaxwell left the Academy in 1847 at age 16 and began attending classes at the University of Edinburgh.[40] He had the opportunity to attend the University of Cambridge, but decided, after his first term, to complete the full course of his undergraduate studies at Edinburgh. The academic staff of the university included some highly regarded names; his first year tutors included Sir William Hamilton, who lectured him on logic and metaphysics, Philip Kelland on mathematics, and James Forbes on natural philosophy.[17] He did not find his classes demanding,[41] and was therefore able to immerse himself in private study during free time at the university and particularly when back home at Glenlair.[42] There he would experiment with improvised chemical, electric, and magnetic apparatus; however, his chief concerns regarded the properties of polarised light.[43] He constructed shaped blocks of gelatine, subjected them to various stresses, and with a pair of polarising prisms given to him by William Nicol, viewed the coloured fringes that had developed within the jelly.[44] Through this practice he discovered photoelasticity, which is a means of determining the stress distribution within physical structures.[45]/nAt age 18, Maxwell contributed two papers for the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. One of these, \"On the Equilibrium of Elastic Solids\", laid the foundation for an important discovery later in his life, which was the temporary double refraction produced in viscous liquids by shear stress.[46] His other paper was \"Rolling Curves\" and, just as with the paper \"Oval Curves\" that he had written at the Edinburgh Academy, he was again considered too young to stand at the rostrum to present it himself. The paper was delivered to the Royal Society by his tutor Kelland instead.[47]/nIn October 1850, already an accomplished mathematician, Maxwell left Scotland for the University of Cambridge. He initially attended Peterhouse, but before the end of his first term transferred to Trinity, where he believed it would be easier to obtain a fellowship.[48] At Trinity he was elected to the elite secret society known as the Cambridge Apostles.[49] Maxwell's intellectual understanding of his Christian faith and of science grew rapidly during his Cambridge years. He joined the \"Apostles\", an exclusive debating society of the intellectual elite, where through his essays he sought to work out this understanding./nNow my great plan, which was conceived of old, ... is to let nothing be wilfully left unexamined. Nothing is to be holy ground consecrated to Stationary Faith, whether positive or negative. All fallow land is to be ploughed up and a regular system of rotation followed. ... Never hide anything, be it weed or no, nor seem to wish it hidden. ... Again I assert the Right of Trespass on any plot of Holy Ground which any man has set apart. ... Now I am convinced that no one but a Christian can actually purge his land of these holy spots. ... I do not say that no Christians have enclosed places of this sort. Many have a great deal, and every one has some. But there are extensive and important tracts in the territory of the Scoffer, the Pantheist, the Quietist, Formalist, Dogmatist, Sensualist, and the rest, which are openly and solemnly Tabooed. ...\"/nChristianity\u2014that is, the religion of the Bible\u2014is the only scheme or form of belief which disavows any possessions on such a tenure. Here alone all is free. You may fly to the ends of the world and find no God but the Author of Salvation. You may search the Scriptures and not find a text to stop you in your explorations. .../nThe Old Testament and the Mosaic Law and Judaism are commonly supposed to be \"Tabooed\" by the orthodox. Sceptics pretend to have read them and have found certain witty objections ... which too many of the orthodox unread admit, and shut up the subject as haunted. But a Candle is coming to drive out all Ghosts and Bugbears. Let us follow the light.[50]/nIn the summer of his third year, Maxwell spent some time at the Suffolk home of the Rev C.B. Tayler, the uncle of a classmate, G.W.H. Tayler. The love of God shown by the family impressed Maxwell, particularly after he was nursed back from ill health by the minister and his wife.[51]/nOn his return to Cambridge, Maxwell writes to his recent host a chatty and affectionate letter including the following testimony,[50]/n... I have the capacity of being more wicked than any example that man could set me, and ... if I escape, it is only by God's grace helping me to get rid of myself, partially in science, more completely in society, \u2014but not perfectly except by committing myself to God .../nIn November 1851, Maxwell studied under William Hopkins, whose success in nurturing mathematical genius had earned him the nickname of \"senior wrangler-maker\".[52]/nIn 1854, Maxwell graduated from Trinity with a degree in mathematics. He scored second highest in the final examination, coming behind Edward Routh and earning himself the title of Second Wrangler. He was later declared equal with Routh in the more exacting ordeal of the Smith's Prize examination.[53] Immediately after earning his degree, Maxwell read his paper \"On the Transformation of Surfaces by Bending\" to the Cambridge Philosophical Society.[54] This is one of the few purely mathematical papers he had written, demonstrating his growing stature as a mathematician.[55] Maxwell decided to remain at Trinity after graduating and applied for a fellowship, which was a process that he could expect to take a couple of years.[56] Buoyed by his success as a research student, he would be free, apart from some tutoring and examining duties, to pursue scientific interests at his own leisure.[56]/nThe nature and perception of colour was one such interest which he had begun at the University of Edinburgh while he was a student of Forbes.[57] With the coloured spinning tops invented by Forbes, Maxwell was able to demonstrate that white light would result from a mixture of red, green, and blue light.[57] His paper \"Experiments on Colour\" laid out the principles of colour combination and was presented to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in March 1855.[58] Maxwell was this time able to deliver it himself.[58]/nMaxwell was made a fellow of Trinity on 10 October 1855, sooner than was the norm,[58] and was asked to prepare lectures on hydrostatics and optics and to set examination papers.[59] The following February he was urged by Forbes to apply for the newly vacant Chair of Natural Philosophy at Marischal College, Aberdeen.[60][61] His father assisted him in the task of preparing the necessary references, but died on 2 April at Glenlair before either knew the result of Maxwell's candidacy.[61] He accepted the professorship at Aberdeen, leaving Cambridge in November 1856.[59]/nThe 25-year-old Maxwell was a good 15 years younger than any other professor at Marischal. He engaged himself with his new responsibilities as head of a department, devising the syllabus and preparing lectures.[62] He committed himself to lecturing 15 hours a week, including a weekly pro bono lecture to the local working men's college.[62] He lived in Aberdeen with his cousin William Dyce Cay, a Scottish civil engineer, during the six months of the academic year and spent the summers at Glenlair, which he had inherited from his father.[20]/nHe focused his attention on a problem that had eluded scientists for 200 years: the nature of Saturn's rings. It was unknown how they could remain stable without breaking up, drifting away or crashing into Saturn.[63] The problem took on a particular resonance at that time because St John's College, Cambridge, had chosen it as the topic for the 1857 Adams Prize.[64] Maxwell devoted two years to studying the problem, proving that a regular solid ring could not be stable, while a fluid ring would be forced by wave action to break up into blobs. Since neither was observed, he concluded that the rings must be composed of numerous small particles he called \"brick-bats\", each independently orbiting Saturn.[64] Maxwell was awarded the \u00a3130 Adams Prize in 1859 for his essay \"On the stability of the motion of Saturn's rings\";[65] he was the only entrant to have made enough headway to submit an entry.[66] His work was so detailed and convincing that when George Biddell Airy read it he commented, \"It is one of the most remarkable applications of mathematics to physics that I have ever seen.\"[1] It was considered the final word on the issue until direct observations by the Voyager flybys of the 1980s confirmed Maxwell's prediction that the rings were composed of particles.[67]  It is now understood, however, that the rings' particles are not totally stable, being pulled by gravity onto Saturn.  The rings are expected to vanish entirely over the next 300 million years.[68]/nIn 1857 Maxwell befriended the Reverend Daniel Dewar, who was then the Principal of Marischal.[69] Through him Maxwell met Dewar's daughter, Katherine Mary Dewar. They were engaged in February 1858 and married in Aberdeen on 2 June 1858. On the marriage record, Maxwell is listed as Professor of Natural Philosophy in Marischal College, Aberdeen.[70] Katherine was seven years Maxwell's senior. Comparatively little is known of her, although it is known that she helped in his lab and worked on experiments in viscosity.[71] Maxwell's biographer and friend, Lewis Campbell, adopted an uncharacteristic reticence on the subject of Katherine, though describing their married life as \"one of unexampled devotion\".[72]/nIn 1860 Marischal College merged with the neighbouring King's College to form the University of Aberdeen. There was no room for two professors of Natural Philosophy, so Maxwell, despite his scientific reputation, found himself laid off. He was unsuccessful in applying for Forbes's recently vacated chair at Edinburgh, the post instead going to Tait. Maxwell was granted the Chair of Natural Philosophy at King's College, London, instead.[73] After recovering from a near-fatal bout of smallpox in 1860, he moved to London with his wife.[74]/nMaxwell's time at King's was probably the most productive of his career. He was awarded the Royal Society's Rumford Medal in 1860 for his work on colour and was later elected to the Society in 1861.[76] This period of his life would see him display the world's first light-fast colour photograph, further develop his ideas on the viscosity of gases, and propose a system of defining physical quantities\u2014now known as dimensional analysis. Maxwell would often attend lectures at the Royal Institution, where he came into regular contact with Michael Faraday. The relationship between the two men could not be described as being close, because Faraday was 40\u00a0years Maxwell's senior and showed signs of senility. They nevertheless maintained a strong respect for each other's talents.[77]/nThis time is especially noteworthy for the advances Maxwell made in the fields of electricity and magnetism. He examined the nature of both electric and magnetic fields in his two-part paper \"On physical lines of force\", which was published in 1861. In it he provided a conceptual model for electromagnetic induction, consisting of tiny spinning cells of magnetic flux. Two more parts were later added to and published in that same paper in early 1862. In the first additional part he discussed the nature of electrostatics and displacement current. In the second additional part, he dealt with the rotation of the plane of the polarisation of light in a magnetic field, a phenomenon that had been discovered by Faraday and is now known as the Faraday effect.[78]/nIn 1865 Maxwell resigned the chair at King's College, London, and returned to Glenlair with Katherine. In his paper \"On governors\" (1868) he mathematically described the behaviour of governors\u2014devices that control the speed of steam engines\u2014thereby establishing the theoretical basis of control engineering.[79] In his paper \"On reciprocal figures, frames and diagrams of forces\" (1870) he discussed the rigidity of various designs of lattice.[80][81] He wrote the textbook Theory of Heat (1871) and the treatise Matter and Motion (1876). Maxwell was also the first to make explicit use of dimensional analysis, in 1871.[82]/nIn 1871 he returned to Cambridge to become the first Cavendish Professor of Physics.[83] Maxwell was put in charge of the development of the Cavendish Laboratory, supervising every step in the progress of the building and of the purchase of the collection of apparatus.[84] One of Maxwell's last great contributions to science was the editing (with copious original notes) of the research of Henry Cavendish, from which it appeared that Cavendish researched, amongst other things, such questions as the density of the Earth and the composition of water.[85] He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1876.[86]/nIn April 1879 Maxwell began to have difficulty in swallowing, the first symptom of his fatal illness.[87]/nMaxwell died in Cambridge of abdominal cancer on 5 November 1879 at the age of 48.[40] His mother had died at the same age of the same type of cancer.[88] The minister who regularly visited him in his last weeks was astonished at his lucidity and the immense power and scope of his memory, but comments more particularly,/n... his illness drew out the whole heart and soul and spirit of the man: his firm and undoubting faith in the Incarnation and all its results; in the full sufficiency of the Atonement; in the work of the Holy Spirit. He had gauged and fathomed all the schemes and systems of philosophy, and had found them utterly empty and unsatisfying\u2014\"unworkable\" was his own word about them\u2014and he turned with simple faith to the Gospel of the Saviour./nAs death approached Maxwell told a Cambridge colleague,[50]/nI have been thinking how very gently I have always been dealt with. I have never had a violent shove all my life. The only desire which I can have is like David to serve my own generation by the will of God, and then fall asleep./nMaxwell is buried at Parton Kirk, near Castle Douglas in Galloway close to where he grew up.[89] The extended biography The Life of James Clerk Maxwell, by his former schoolfellow and lifelong friend Professor Lewis Campbell, was published in 1882.[90][91] His collected works were issued in two volumes by the Cambridge University Press in 1890.[92]/nThe executors of Maxwell's estate were his physician George Edward Paget, G. G. Stokes, and Colin Mackenzie, who was Maxwell's cousin. Overburdened with work, Stokes passed Maxwell's papers to William Garnett, who had effective custody of the papers until about 1884.[93]/nThere is a memorial inscription to him near the choir screen at Westminster Abbey.[94]/nAs a great lover of Scottish poetry, Maxwell memorised poems and wrote his own.[95] The best known is Rigid Body Sings, closely based on \"Comin' Through the Rye\" by Robert Burns, which he apparently used to sing while accompanying himself on a guitar. It has the opening lines[96]/nGin a body meet a body/nFlyin' through the air.\nGin a body hit a body,/nWill it fly? And where?/nA collection of his poems was published by his friend Lewis Campbell in 1882.[97]/nDescriptions of Maxwell remark upon his remarkable intellectual qualities being matched by social awkwardness.[98]/nMaxwell wrote the following aphorism for his own conduct as a scientist:/nHe that would enjoy life and act with freedom must have the work of the day continually before his eyes. Not yesterday's work, lest he fall into despair, not to-morrow's, lest he become a visionary not that which ends with the day, which is a worldly work, nor yet that only which remains to eternity, for by it he cannot shape his action. Happy is the man who can recognize in the work of to-day a connected portion of the work of life, and an embodiment of the work of eternity. The foundations of his confidence are unchangeable, for he has been made a partaker of Infinity. He strenuously works out his daily enterprises, because the present is given him for a possession.[99]/nMaxwell was an evangelical Presbyterian and in his later years became an Elder of the Church of Scotland.[100] Maxwell's religious beliefs and related activities have been the focus of a number of papers.[101][102][103][104] Attending both Church of Scotland (his father's denomination) and Episcopalian (his mother's denomination) services as a child, Maxwell underwent an evangelical conversion in April 1853.  One facet of this conversion may have aligned him with an antipositivist position.[103]/nMaxwell had studied and commented on electricity and magnetism as early as 1855 when his paper \"On Faraday's lines of force\" was read to the Cambridge Philosophical Society.[105] The paper presented a simplified model of Faraday's work and how electricity and magnetism are related. He reduced all of the current knowledge into a linked set of differential equations with 20 equations in 20 variables. This work was later published as \"On Physical Lines of Force\" in March 1861.[106]/nAround 1862, while lecturing at King's College, Maxwell calculated that the speed of propagation of an electromagnetic field is approximately that of the speed of light. He considered this to be more than just a coincidence, commenting, \"We can scarcely avoid the conclusion that light consists in the transverse undulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.[1]/nWorking on the problem further, Maxwell showed that the equations predict the existence of waves of oscillating electric and magnetic fields that travel through empty space at a speed that could be predicted from simple electrical experiments; using the data available at the time, Maxwell obtained a velocity of 310,740,000 metres per second (1.0195\u00d7109\u00a0ft/s).[107] In his 1865 paper \"A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field\", Maxwell wrote, \"The agreement of the results seems to show that light and magnetism are affections of the same substance, and that light is an electromagnetic disturbance propagated through the field according to electromagnetic laws\".[4]/nHis famous twenty equations, in their modern form of partial differential equations, first appeared in fully developed form in his textbook A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism in 1873.[108] Most of this work was done by Maxwell at Glenlair during the period between holding his London post and his taking up the Cavendish chair.[1] Oliver Heaviside reduced the complexity of Maxwell's theory down to four partial differential equations,[109] known now collectively as Maxwell's Laws or Maxwell's equations. Although potentials became much less popular in the nineteenth century,[110] the use of scalar and vector potentials is now standard in the solution of Maxwell's equations.[111]/nAs Barrett and Grimes (1995) describe:[112]/nMaxwell expressed electromagnetism in the algebra of quaternions and made the electromagnetic potential the centerpiece of his theory. In 1881 Heaviside replaced the electromagnetic potential field by force fields as the centerpiece of electromagnetic theory. According to Heaviside, the electromagnetic potential field was arbitrary and needed to be \"assassinated\". (sic) A few years later there was a debate between Heaviside and [Peter Guthrie] Tate (sic) about the relative merits of vector analysis and quaternions. The result was the realization that there was no need for the greater physical insights provided by quaternions if the theory was purely local, and vector analysis became commonplace./nMaxwell was proved correct, and his quantitative connection between light and electromagnetism is considered one of the great accomplishments of 19th-century mathematical physics.[113]/nMaxwell also introduced the concept of the electromagnetic field in comparison to force lines that Faraday described.[114] By understanding the propagation of electromagnetism as a field emitted by active particles, Maxwell could advance his work on light. At that time, Maxwell believed that the propagation of light required a medium for the waves, dubbed the luminiferous aether.[114] Over time, the existence of such a medium, permeating all space and yet apparently undetectable by mechanical means, proved impossible to reconcile with experiments such as the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment.[115] Moreover, it seemed to require an absolute frame of reference in which the equations were valid, with the distasteful result that the equations changed form for a moving observer. These difficulties inspired Albert Einstein to formulate the theory of special relativity; in the process Einstein dispensed with the requirement of a stationary luminiferous aether.[116]/nAlong with most physicists of the time, Maxwell had a strong interest in psychology. Following in the steps of Isaac Newton and Thomas Young, he was particularly interested in the study of colour vision. From 1855 to 1872, Maxwell published at intervals a series of investigations concerning the perception of colour, colour-blindness, and colour theory, and was awarded the Rumford Medal for \"On the Theory of Colour Vision\".[117]/nIsaac Newton had demonstrated, using prisms, that white light, such as sunlight, is composed of a number of monochromatic components which could then be recombined into white light.[118] Newton also showed that an orange paint made of yellow and red could look exactly like a monochromatic orange light, although being composed of two monochromatic yellow and red lights. Hence the paradox that puzzled physicists of the time: two complex lights (composed of more than one monochromatic light) could look alike but be physically different, called metameres. Thomas Young later proposed that this paradox could be explained by colours being perceived through a limited number of channels in the eyes, which he proposed to be threefold,[119] the trichromatic colour theory. Maxwell used the recently developed linear algebra to prove Young's theory. Any monochromatic light stimulating three receptors should be able to be equally stimulated by a set of three different monochromatic lights (in fact, by any set of three different lights). He demonstrated that to be the case,[120] inventing colour matching experiments and Colourimetry./nMaxwell was also interested in applying his theory of colour perception, namely in colour photography. Stemming directly from his psychological work on colour perception: if a sum of any three lights could reproduce any perceivable colour, then colour photographs could be produced with a set of three coloured filters. In the course of his 1855 paper, Maxwell proposed that, if three black-and-white photographs of a scene were taken through red, green, and blue filters, and transparent prints of the images were projected onto a screen using three projectors equipped with similar filters, when superimposed on the screen the result would be perceived by the human eye as a complete reproduction of all the colours in the scene.[121]/nDuring an 1861 Royal Institution lecture on colour theory, Maxwell presented the world's first demonstration of colour photography by this principle of three-colour analysis and synthesis. Thomas Sutton, inventor of the single-lens reflex camera, took the picture. He photographed a tartan ribbon three times, through red, green, and blue filters, also making a fourth photograph through a yellow filter, which, according to Maxwell's account, was not used in the demonstration. Because Sutton's photographic plates were insensitive to red and barely sensitive to green, the results of this pioneering experiment were far from perfect. It was remarked in the published account of the lecture that \"if the red and green images had been as fully photographed as the blue\", it \"would have been a truly-coloured image of the riband. By finding photographic materials more sensitive to the less refrangible rays, the representation of the colours of objects might be greatly improved.\"[76][122][123] Researchers in 1961 concluded that the seemingly impossible partial success of the red-filtered exposure was due to ultraviolet light, which is strongly reflected by some red dyes, not entirely blocked by the red filter used, and within the range of sensitivity of the wet collodion process Sutton employed.[124]/nMaxwell also investigated the kinetic theory of gases. Originating with Daniel Bernoulli, this theory was advanced by the successive labours of John Herapath, John James Waterston, James Joule, and particularly Rudolf Clausius, to such an extent as to put its general accuracy beyond a doubt; but it received enormous development from Maxwell, who in this field appeared as an experimenter (on the laws of gaseous friction) as well as a mathematician.[125]/nBetween 1859 and 1866, he developed the theory of the distributions of velocities in particles of a gas, work later generalised by Ludwig Boltzmann.[126][127] The formula, called the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution, gives the fraction of gas molecules moving at a specified velocity at any given temperature. In the kinetic theory, temperatures and heat involve only molecular movement. This approach generalised the previously established laws of thermodynamics and explained existing observations and experiments in a better way than had been achieved previously. His work on thermodynamics led him to devise the thought experiment that came to be known as Maxwell's demon, where the second law of thermodynamics is violated by an imaginary being capable of sorting particles by energy.[128]/nIn 1871, he established Maxwell's thermodynamic relations, which are statements of equality among the second derivatives of the thermodynamic potentials with respect to different thermodynamic variables. In 1874, he constructed a plaster thermodynamic visualisation as a way of exploring phase transitions, based on the American scientist Josiah Willard Gibbs's graphical thermodynamics papers.[129][130]/nMaxwell published the paper \"On governors\" in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, vol. 16 (1867\u20131868).[131] This paper is considered a central paper of the early days of control theory.[132] Here \"governors\" refers to the governor or the centrifugal governor used to regulate steam engines.", "47601930": "Dmitry Dolgopyat is a Russian-American mathematician specializing in dynamical systems,[1] a field that studies the time evolution of natural and abstract systems.[2] An internationally acclaimed lecturer, he holds the position of Distinguished University Professor at the University of Maryland,[3] and is a foreign member of the Academia Europaea.[4]/nDmitry Dolgopyat graduated from Moscow State School 57 mathematical class in 1989.[5]/nFrom 1989 to 1994, he was an undergraduate student at Moscow State University.[6]/nFrom 1994 to 1997, Dolgopyat was enrolled at Princeton University, where he earned a PhD under the guidance of Yakov Sinai.[7]/nFrom September 1999 to June 2003, Dmitry Dolgopyat served as an Assistant Professor at Penn State University.[8]/nDolgopyat joined the University of Maryland as an Associate Professor from September 2002 to June 2006.

He significantly shaped the way Maxwell's equations are understood and applied in the decades following Maxwell's death. His formulation of the telegrapher's equations became commercially important during his own lifetime, after their significance went unremarked for a long while, as few others were versed at the time in his novel methodology.[2] Although at odds with the scientific establishment for most of his life, Heaviside changed the face of telecommunications, mathematics, and science.[2]/nHeaviside was born in Camden Town, London, at 55 Kings Street[3]:\u200a13\u200a (now Plender Street), the youngest of three children of Thomas, a draughtsman and wood engraver, and Rachel Elizabeth (n\u00e9e West). He was a short and red-headed child, and suffered from scarlet fever when young, which left him with a hearing impairment. A small legacy enabled the family to move to a better part of Camden when he was thirteen and he was sent to Camden House Grammar School. He was a good student, placing fifth out of five hundred students in 1865, but his parents could not keep him at school after he was 16, so he continued studying for a year by himself and had no further formal education.[4]:\u200a51/nHeaviside's uncle by marriage was Sir Charles Wheatstone (1802\u20131875), an internationally celebrated expert in telegraphy and electromagnetism, and the original co-inventor of the first commercially successful telegraph in the mid-1830s. Wheatstone took a strong interest in his nephew's education[5] and in 1867 sent him north to work with his older brother Arthur Wheatstone, who was managing one of Charles' telegraph companies in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.[4]:\u200a53/nTwo years later he took a job as a telegraph operator with the Danish Great Northern Telegraph Company laying a cable from Newcastle to Denmark using British contractors. He soon became an electrician. Heaviside continued to study while working, and by the age of 22 he published an article in the prestigious Philosophical Magazine on 'The Best Arrangement of Wheatstone's Bridge for measuring a Given Resistance with a Given Galvanometer and Battery'[6] which received positive comments from physicists who had unsuccessfully tried to solve this algebraic problem, including Sir William Thomson, to whom he gave a copy of the paper, and James Clerk Maxwell. When he published an article on the duplex method of using a telegraph cable,[7] he poked fun at R. S. Culley, the engineer in chief of the Post Office telegraph system, who had been dismissing duplex as impractical. Later in 1873 his application to join the Society of Telegraph Engineers was turned down with the comment that \"they didn't want telegraph clerks\". This riled Heaviside, who asked Thomson to sponsor him, and along with support of the society's president he was admitted \"despite the P.O. snobs\".[4]:\u200a60/nIn 1873 Heaviside had encountered Maxwell's newly published, and later famous, two-volume Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism. In his old age Heaviside recalled:/nI remember my first look at the great treatise of Maxwell's when I was a young man... I saw that it was great, greater and greatest, with prodigious possibilities in its power... I was determined to master the book and set to work. I was very ignorant. I had no knowledge of mathematical analysis (having learned only school algebra and trigonometry which I had largely forgotten) and thus my work was laid out for me. It took me several years before I could understand as much as I possibly could. Then I set Maxwell aside and followed my own course. And I progressed much more quickly... It will be understood that I preach the gospel according to my interpretation of Maxwell.[8]/nUndertaking research from home, he helped develop transmission line theory (also known as the \"telegrapher's equations\"). Heaviside showed mathematically that uniformly distributed inductance in a telegraph line would diminish both attenuation and distortion, and that, if the inductance were great enough and the insulation resistance not too high, the circuit would be distortionless in that currents of all frequencies would have equal speeds of propagation.[9] Heaviside's equations helped further the implementation of the telegraph./nFrom 1882 to 1902, except for three years, he contributed regular articles to the trade paper The Electrician, which wished to improve its standing, for which he was paid \u00a340 per year. This was hardly enough to live on, but his demands were very small and he was doing what he most wanted to. Between 1883 and 1887 these averaged 2\u20133 articles per month and these articles later formed the bulk of his Electromagnetic Theory and Electrical Papers.[4]:\u200a71/nIn 1880, Heaviside researched the skin effect in telegraph transmission lines. That same year he patented, in England, the coaxial cable. In 1884 he recast Maxwell's mathematical analysis from its original cumbersome form (they had already been recast as quaternions) to its modern vector terminology, thereby reducing twelve of the original twenty equations in twenty unknowns down to the four differential equations in two unknowns we now know as Maxwell's equations. The four re-formulated Maxwell's equations describe the nature of electric charges (both static and moving), magnetic fields, and the relationship between the two, namely electromagnetic fields./nBetween 1880 and 1887, Heaviside developed the operational calculus using \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n for the differential operator, (which Boole had previously denoted by \n\n\n\nD\n\n\n{\\displaystyle D}\n\n[10]), giving a method of solving differential equations by direct solution as algebraic equations. This later caused a great deal of controversy, owing to its lack of rigour. He famously said, \"Mathematics is an experimental science, and definitions do not come first, but later on. They make themselves, when the nature of the subject has developed itself.\"[11] On another occasion he asked, \"Shall I refuse my dinner because I do not fully understand the process of digestion?\"[12]/nIn 1887, Heaviside worked with his brother Arthur on a paper entitled \"The Bridge System of Telephony\". However the paper was blocked by Arthur's superior, William Henry Preece of the Post Office, because part of the proposal was that loading coils (inductors) should be added to telephone and telegraph lines to increase their self-induction and correct the distortion which they suffered. Preece had recently declared self-inductance to be the great enemy of clear transmission. Heaviside was also convinced that Preece was behind the sacking of the editor of The Electrician which brought his long-running series of articles to a halt (until 1891).[13] There was a long history of animosity between Preece and Heaviside. Heaviside considered Preece to be mathematically incompetent, an assessment supported by the biographer Paul J. Nahin: \"Preece was a powerful government official, enormously ambitious, and in some remarkable ways, an utter blockhead.\" Preece's motivations in suppressing Heaviside's work were more to do with protecting Preece's own reputation and avoiding having to admit error than any perceived faults in Heaviside's work.[3]:\u200axi\u2013xvii,\u200a162\u2013183/nThe importance of Heaviside's work remained undiscovered for some time after publication in The Electrician. In 1897, AT&T employed one of its own scientists, George A. Campbell, and an external investigator Michael I. Pupin to find some respect in which Heaviside's work was incomplete or incorrect. Campbell and Pupin extended Heaviside's work, and AT&T filed for patents covering not only their research, but also the technical method of constructing the coils previously invented by Heaviside. AT&T later offered Heaviside money in exchange for his rights; it is possible that the Bell engineers' respect for Heaviside influenced this offer. However, Heaviside refused the offer, declining to accept any money unless the company were to give him full recognition. Heaviside was chronically poor, making his refusal of the offer even more striking. In 1959, Norbert Wiener published his fiction The Tempter and accused AT&T (named Williams Controls Company) and Michael I. Pupin (named Diego Dominguez) of having usurped Heaviside's inventions.[14][15][16]/nBut this setback had the effect of turning Heaviside's attention towards electromagnetic radiation,[17] and in two papers of 1888 and 1889, he calculated the deformations of electric and magnetic fields surrounding a moving charge, as well as the effects of it entering a denser medium. This included a prediction of what is now known as Cherenkov radiation, and inspired his friend George FitzGerald to suggest what now is known as the Lorentz\u2013FitzGerald contraction./nIn 1889, Heaviside first published a correct derivation of the magnetic force on a moving charged particle,[18] which is the magnetic component of what is now called the Lorentz force./nIn the late 1880s and early 1890s, Heaviside worked on the concept of electromagnetic mass. Heaviside treated this as material mass, capable of producing the same effects. Wilhelm Wien later verified Heaviside's expression (for low velocities)./nIn 1891 the British Royal Society recognized Heaviside's contributions to the mathematical description of electromagnetic phenomena by naming him a Fellow of the Royal Society, and the following year devoting more than fifty pages of the Philosophical Transactions of the Society to his vector methods and electromagnetic theory. In 1905 Heaviside was given an honorary doctorate by the University of G\u00f6ttingen./nIn 1896, FitzGerald and John Perry obtained a civil list pension of \u00a3120\u00a0per year for Heaviside, who was now living in Devon, and persuaded him to accept it, after he had rejected other charitable offers from the Royal Society.[17]/nIn 1902, Heaviside proposed the existence of what is now known as the Kennelly\u2013Heaviside layer of the ionosphere. Heaviside's proposal included means by which radio signals are transmitted around the Earth's curvature. The existence of the ionosphere was confirmed in 1923. The predictions by Heaviside, combined with Planck's radiation theory, probably discouraged further attempts to detect radio waves from the Sun and other astronomical objects. For whatever reason, there seem to have been no attempts for 30\u00a0years, until Jansky's development of radio astronomy in 1932./nHeaviside was an opponent of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity.[19] Mathematician Howard Eves has commented that Heaviside \"was the only first-rate physicist at the time to impugn Einstein, and his invectives against relativity theory often bordered on the absurd\".[19]/nIn later years his behavior became quite eccentric. According to associate B.A. Behrend, he became a recluse who was so averse to meeting people that he delivered the manuscripts of his Electrician papers to a grocery store, where the editors picked them up.[20]\nThough he had been an active cyclist in his youth, his health seriously declined in his sixth decade. During this time Heaviside would sign letters with the initials \"W.O.R.M.\" after his name. Heaviside also reportedly started painting his fingernails pink and had granite blocks moved into his house for furniture.[3]:\u200axx\u200a In 1922, he became the first recipient of the Faraday Medal, which was established that year./nOn Heaviside's religious views, he was a Unitarian, but not religious. He was even said to have made fun of people who put their faith in a supreme being.[21]/nHeaviside died on 3\u00a0February 1925, at Torquay in Devon after falling from a ladder,[22] and is buried near the eastern corner of Paignton cemetery. He is buried with his father, Thomas Heaviside (1813\u20131896), and his mother, Rachel Elizabeth Heaviside. The gravestone was cleaned thanks to an anonymous donor sometime in 2005.[23] He was always held in high regard by most electrical engineers, particularly after his correction to Kelvin's transmission line analysis was vindicated, but most of his wider recognition was gained posthumously./nIn July 2014, academics at Newcastle University, UK and the Newcastle Electromagnetics Interest Group founded the Heaviside Memorial Project[24] in a bid to fully restore the monument through public subscription.[25][26] The restored memorial was ceremonially unveiled on 30 August 2014 by Alan Heather, a distant relative of Heaviside. The unveiling was attended by the Mayor of Torbay, the Member of Parliament (MP) for Torbay, an ex-curator of the Science Museum (representing the Institution of Engineering and Technology), the Chairman of the Torbay Civic Society, and delegates from Newcastle University.[27]/nA collection of Heaviside's papers is held at the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) Archive Centre. [28]  The collection consists of notebooks containing mathematical equations and calculations, annotated pamphlets mainly relating to telegraphy, manuscript notes, drafts of papers, correspondence, drafts of articles for \u2018Electromagnetic Theory\u2019.\nAn audio tribute from 1950 to Oliver Heaviside by Oliver E Buckley, President of Bell Telephone Labs, has been digitised and accessible on the IET Archives biography of Oliver Heaviside.[29]/nIn 1908 Oliver Heaviside was made an Honorary Member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE). His entry reads as: \u201c1908 Oliver Heaviside FRS\u201d in the IEE Roll of Honorary Members and Faraday Medallists 1871-1921 [30][31]\nIn 1922, he became the first recipient of the Faraday Medal, which was established that year. Later on, in 1950 the Institution of Electrical Engineers Council established the Heaviside Premium Award \u201cThe Committee have considered the establishment of some form of permanent memorial to Oliver Heaviside and as a result recommend that a Heaviside Premium to the value of \u00a310 be awarded each year for the best mathematical paper accepted.\u201d [32]/nHeaviside did much to develop and advocate vector methods and vector calculus.[33] Maxwell's formulation of electromagnetism consisted of 20 equations in 20 variables. Heaviside employed the curl and divergence operators of the vector calculus to reformulate 12 of these 20 equations into four equations in four variables (\n\n\n\n\n\nB\n\n\n,\n\n\nE\n\n\n,\n\n\nJ\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nand\n\n\u00a0\n\u03c1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\textbf {B}},{\\textbf {E}},{\\textbf {J}}~{\\text{and}}~\\rho }\n\n), the form by which they have been known ever since (see Maxwell's equations). Less well known is that Heaviside's equations and Maxwell's are not exactly the same, and in fact it is easier to modify the former to make them compatible with quantum physics.[34] The possibility of gravitational waves was also discussed by Heaviside using the analogy between the inverse-square law in gravitation and electricity.[35] With quaternion multiplication, the square of a vector is a negative quantity, much to Heaviside's displeasure. As he advocated abolishing this negativity, he has been credited by C. J. Joly[36] with developing hyperbolic quaternions, though in fact that mathematical structure was largely the work of Alexander Macfarlane./nHe invented the Heaviside step function, using it to calculate the current when an electric circuit is switched on. He was the first to use the unit impulse function now usually known as the Dirac delta function.[37] He invented his operational calculus method for solving linear differential equations. This resembles the currently used Laplace transform method based on the \"Bromwich integral\" named after Bromwich who devised a rigorous mathematical justification for Heaviside's operator method using contour integration.[38] Heaviside was familiar with the Laplace transform method but considered his own method more direct.[39][40]/nHeaviside developed the transmission line theory (also known as the \"telegrapher's equations\"), which had the effect of increasing the transmission rate over transatlantic cables by a factor of ten. It originally took ten minutes to transmit each character, and this immediately improved to one character per minute. Closely related to this was his discovery that telephone transmission could be greatly improved by placing electrical inductance in series with the cable.[41] Heaviside also independently discovered the Poynting vector.[3]:\u200a116\u2013118/nHeaviside advanced the idea that the Earth's uppermost atmosphere contained an ionized layer known as the ionosphere; in this regard, he predicted the existence of what later was dubbed the Kennelly\u2013Heaviside layer. In 1947 Edward Victor Appleton received the Nobel Prize in Physics for proving that this layer really existed./nHeaviside coined the following terms of art in electromagnetic theory:/nHeaviside is sometimes incorrectly credited with coining susceptance (the imaginary part of admittance) and reactance (the imaginary part of impedance). The former was coined by Charles Proteus Steinmetz (1894).[43] The latter was coined by M. Hospitalier (1893).[44]", "58677559": "Margaret Louise Brown OBE is a British mathematics educator known for her research on numeracy and the learning stages of mathematics.

He obtained his PhD in Mathematics in 1998, at Lund University, under the direction of Arne Meurman.[1] After defending his PhD thesis in 1998, he embarked in postdoctoral studies at the Mittag-Leffler Institute for six months and at the University of Strasbourg for two years. He was appointed Associate Professor in 2001, and Lecturer in 2005 at Stockholm University. A year later he was granted the Swedish Mathematical Society's Wallenberg Prize. Promoted to Full Professor in 2008, he was awarded a Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences Fellowship, in 2009, and the Crafoord prize research grant diploma.[2]/nBorcea's scientific work ranged from vertex operator theory to zero distribution of polynomials and entire functions, via correlation inequalities and statistical mechanics. His thesis consists of two seemingly independent parts: one in vertex operator theory and the other devoted to the geometry of zeros of complex polynomials in one variable./nIn vertex operator theory, Julius generalized results of Mirko Primc and Arne Meurman[3] and gave a classification of annihilated fields. As concerns complex polynomials, he tackled Sendov\u2019s conjecture on zeros and critical points of complex polynomials in one variable. Using \nnovel techniques, he proved the conjecture for polynomials of degree not exceeding 7. Earlier (1969) the conjecture had been proven for polynomials of degree not exceeding 5. At Stockholm University, Julius had a steady collaboration with Rikard B\u00f8gvad and Boris Shapiro. They worked on rational approximations of algebraic equations, piecewise harmonic functions and positive Cauchy transforms, and the geometry of zeros of polynomials in one variable. Borcea and Petter Br\u00e4nd\u00e9n collaborated on a project on the geometry of zeros of polynomials and entire functions. They characterized all linear operators on polynomials \npreserving the property of having only real zeros, a problem that goes back to Edmond Laguerre and to George P\u00f3lya and Issai Schur. These results were subsequently extended to several variables, and a connection to the Lee\u2013Yang theorem on phase-transitions in statistical physics was made. Together with Tom Liggett (UCLA) they applied their methods to problems in probability theory and were able to prove an important conjecture about the preservation of negative dependence properties in the symmetric exclusion process./nBorcea had a comprehensive project on the distribution of positive charges and the Hausdorff geometry of complex polynomials. One of the motivations for the project was to bring Sendov\u2019s conjecture into a larger and more natural context. He formulated several interesting conjectures, and in the summer of 2008 he was the driving force of two meetings, one at the American Institute of Mathematics in San Jose, California and the other at the Banff International Research Station[4] together with Dmitry Khavinson, Rajesh Pereira, Mihai Putinar, Edward B.

Among them are the cancellation of a project which would have built a water park on 7 hectares of Tineretului Park,[3] saving from demolition a number of heritage buildings on \u0218oseaua Kiseleff no. 45, and the cancelation of a project which would have built a glass building on top of Palatul \u0218tirbei on Calea Victoriei./nThe association was also able to push some changes in 2009 to the urban planning law.[3]/nNicu\u0219or Dan announced his candidacy for Mayor of Bucharest in November 2011 at a caf\u00e9 on Arthur Verona street, with just a few guests, among which Theodor Paleologu, a historian and Member of Parliament.[7]/nFor gathering the 36,000 signatures needed for his candidacy, having the backing of no party, he relied on a network of volunteers organized on Facebook. On 22 April, 15 bands and musicians performed pro-bono at Arenele Romane for Dan's campaign in order to help him gather the signatures.[9] During the 12-hour-long concert, volunteers gathered 4,000 signatures.[10]/nAmong his proposed projects are the creation of a light rail infrastructure over the existing rail lines in Bucharest, creating an infrastructure for prioritizing public transport over other traffic in intersections, consolidating buildings that are likely to be affected by earthquakes, protecting the urban green space and clearing illegal buildings from parks.[7]/nDan argues that it is important to incentivize young people to stay in the city, by making it a regional hub in IT, creative industries and higher education, and attracting investors and skilled people from across the region.[11][12]/nHe received support from Andrei Ple\u0219u, who argued that Dan is the only one of the candidates who is interested in the architecture of Bucharest and does not support any utopian initiatives.[13] He also received support from political scientist and Member of the European Parliament Cristian Preda.[14]/nDan gained the support of some journalists who wrote about him in op-eds from several newspapers: Andrei Cr\u0103ciun of Adev\u0103rul saw in him \"a Don Quijote untouched by the vulgar lard of undeserved riches\" and \"a person who works against the system\".[15] Florin Negru\u021biu, the editor-in-chief of G\u00e2ndul thought he is an \"atypical candidate\" for Bucharest, the model candidate of the intellectuals; nevertheless, the journalist did not see any chances that Dan would become mayor, because he is \"too serious\" a candidate, and unlikely to appeal to the masses.[16] Neculai Constantin Munteanu from Radio Free Europe wrote that he supports Dan for his unselfish way of caring about Bucharest and that his opponents are \"comedians\", for which one can \"admire the imposture, ludicrousness, and incompetence\".[17]/nHaving registered Save Bucharest Union (USB) as a political party in 2015, Nicu\u0219or Dan ran again for Mayor of Bucharest in 2016.[18] This time, the elections were held in a single round. He gained 30,52% of the total votes, losing to the socialist candidate, Gabriela Firea, who gained 42,97% of the total votes.[19]/nIn the election, Dan managed to attract the young electorate, with over half of his voters being under the age of 40.[20] Some of USB's candidates for sector mayor have also performed well in their respective races, proving USB's viability as a future political force.[21]/nWanting to capitalize on the momentum that saw him gain a third of the votes in the local elections, Dan announced shortly after the 2016 local election that the Save Bucharest Union will change its name to Save Romania Union (USR), shifting its focus to a national stage. He also announced plans for the new party to enter the Parliamentary elections of that year.[22][23]/nWith Nicu\u0219or Dan at the top of the candidate list, USR gained 8.92% of the vote in the Senate race and 8.87% in the Chamber of Deputies, which made them the third largest party in Romania.[24][25] The result also meant that Dan became a member of the Chamber of Deputies./nIn 2017, anti-same-sex pressure group Coali\u021bia pentru Familie managed to raise the necessary number of signatures to organize a referendum that would change the part of the Romanian Constitution dealing with marriage, with the hope of redefining it as \"between a man and a woman\".[26] This created a rift within USR, between the progressive wing, who wanted USR to become the only Parliamentary party to oppose the initiative, and Nicu\u0219or Dan, who believed USR should not get involved in the debate and that the party should remain open for both progressives and conservatives.[27][28] An internal referendum within the party followed, in which 52,7% of members voted to position the party against the Constitutional initiative, which triggered Dan to resign from the party on 1 June 2017.[29][30] As explanation for his opposition to the National Council vote he cited religious matters, the dangers of deviating from the main party issue, which is the fight against corruption and his refusal to belong to a party that defines itself as a party of civil liberties.[31]/nAfter his resignation from USR, Nicu\u0219or Dan continued to serve as a member of the Chamber of Deputies as an independent./nDue to a quirk in the Romanian electoral law, USR required his signature when they attempted to legally register their alliance with the Freedom, Unity and Solidarity Party (PLUS). In order to help his former party, in March 2019 Dan briefly rejoined USR as a common member, gave the necessary signature and then resigned for a second time.[32][33]/nIn May 2019, he announced his plans to once again run for Mayor of Bucharest, as an independent. Dan mentioned that while he hopes that his candidacy will be supported by the rest of the opposition parties, he will not run against a different common candidate, unwilling to split the vote of the opposition.[33]/nHe was ultimately supported by both USR and the National Liberal Party (PNL). With 95% of votes counted, partial results suggested that he won the mayoral election with 42.8% of votes. Shortly afterwards exit polls  showed him winning the race, he announced victory.[34] On 5 October 2020 the Central Electoral Bureau confirmed his status as the new Mayor of Bucharest, winning the elections with a majority of 42.81% against Gabriela Firea (37.97%), the former Mayor.[1]/nIn an article published in 2000 in the conservative weekly Dilema, Nicu\u0219or Dan stated that \"I am against the acceptance of homosexual behavior in public spaces, in Romania. I believe this to be an attack against traditional values and therefore, my legitimate collective identity\". The statement kept resurfacing after his political career took off, particularly during his much-publicized departure from USR. Dan distanced himself from his previous statements on several occasions, claiming that he is not homophobic and that his opinion on the matter has changed considerably in the intervening years.[35][36]/nIn 2023, the Times of Israel accused him of antisemitism, after he delayed the development of a Holocaust museum in Bucharest over a dispute regarding its location.[37]/nNicu\u0219or Dan lives with his long-time girlfriend, Mirabela, an executive for Renault. They became the parents in May 2016 of a baby girl and in May 2022 of a baby boy.[38][39]", "25778498": "Robert Schatten (January 28, 1911 \u2013 August 26, 1977) was an American mathematician./nRobert Schatten was born to a Jewish family in Lviv.

Shortly after being appointed to a junior professorship, he joined the United States army where during training he suffered a back injury which affected him for the remainder of his life. In 1943 he was appointed to an assistant professorship at University of Vermont. At National Research Council, by two years he worked with John von Neumann and Nelson Dunford.

He took part in two of the most ambitious English civil engineering projects of the 17th century: draining the Great Level of the Fens and building the Mole at Tangier. In later life, his wealth and influence as Surveyor-General of the Ordnance enabled him to become a patron and driving force behind the establishment of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich./nJonas Moore was born at Higher White Lee, in Higham, which is in Pendle, Lancashire on 8 February 1617, a son of a yeoman farmer, John Moore.[1] His older brother, also John, had allegedly been bewitched to death in about 1610 by Elizabeth Sothernes (Old Demdike), the most notorious of the Pendle witches. There is no record of Jonas's education but it is likely that he attended Burnley Grammar School, which was only three miles from his home. In 1637, he was appointed clerk to Thomas Burwell, Vicar-General of the diocese of Durham, a job requiring competence in the use of legal Latin.[2] He married Eleanor Wren on 8 April 1638 in Durham,[3] and subsequently raised a family of a son and two daughters. During the English Civil War, Parliament sequestered church revenues in October 1642, and Moore with no income had to return to Lancashire./nRecords of Moore's life during the next ten years are sketchy, but by 1650 he was an established mathematics teacher and published his first book, Moores Arithmetick. In 1674, Sir Jonas Moore first used the abbreviated notation 'cos' for the trigonometric term cosine. He went on that year to be appointed Surveyor to the Fen drainage Company of William Russell, 5th Earl of Bedford, and worked on draining the Fens for the next seven years. In 1658, Moore was able to produce a 16-sheet Mapp of the Great Levell of the Fens, which provided an effective means of displaying the Company's achievements in altering the Fenland landscape of East Anglia. The scale of the map (about two inches to the mile) was not to be bettered until the late 19th century.[4]/nIn the early 1660s, Moore worked mainly as a surveyor, mapping the River Thames from \"Westminster to the sea\" in 1662, his first commission from a government body.[5] From 1663, James, Duke of York became Moore's chief patron. In June, Moore visited Tangier (an English possession from 1661 to 1684) as part of a team to design a stone pier. On his return, he prepared a map with the title A Mapp of the Citty of Tanger with Straits of Gibraltar. Described by Jonas Moore Surveyor to his Royall Highness the Duke of York. When it was completed in March 1664, Samuel Pepys, an active member of the Tangiers Committee, was impressed with the map \"which is very pleasant, and I purpose to have it finely set out and hung up.\"[6][7]/nWith the patronage of the King's brother, Moore found a place as a member of the Ordnance Office. He was appointed Assistant Surveyor of the Ordnance on 19 June 1665 as full deputy to Francis Nicholls, who had been Surveyor since 1660.[8] Moore became Surveyor-General of the Ordnance after the death of Nicholls on 28 July 1669.[8]/nThe Surveyor's duties were not confined to land surveying; rather the main duty was to ensure availability of adequate stores, particularly guns and ammunition. During the Third Anglo-Dutch War, Moore met Prince Rupert at The Nore (off the Thames Estuary) with 16 vessels loaded with powder and shot.[9] He received his knighthood on 28 January 1673, probably as a reward for his duties during the first year of the Third Dutch War. With the end of the war in 1674, Moore was able to pursue his interest in astronomy and attempted to gain support from the Royal Society for an observatory at Chelsea College.[10] Moore was elected to the Royal Society on 3 December 1674, but the proposal for an observatory at Chelsea came to nothing. He continued as an active member, and in May 1676 he was appointed a Vice-President of the Royal Society.[11]/nWhen Charles II appointed John Flamsteed his \"astronomical observator\" on 4 March 1675, Flamsteed had already enjoyed Moore's patronage since 1670, when Moore presented him with a Towneley micrometer.[12] The Ordnance Office was responsible for the building of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, which was completed in June 1676. Moore provided much of the Observatory's foundation equipment including the two \"Great Clocks\" by Thomas Tompion, out of his own pocket.[13]/nTowards the end of his life, Moore took a great interest in the Royal Mathematical School at Christ's Hospital in London and he was made a governor in December 1676.[14] In 1677, Moore began to write a book, to be called A New Systeme of the Mathematicks, with the purpose of defining a mathematical course suitable for the school. It was unfinished when Moore died on 27 August 1679./nHe was succeeded as Surveyor General of the Ordnance by his only son, also Jonas. Jonas junior died in 1682 and so it was the husbands of Moore's two daughters, rather than the son, who undertook the publication of the \"New Systeme\", which with the final parts being written by John Flamsteed and Edmond Halley, was completed in 1681. Despite his family's alleged adverse involvement with the Pendle Witches, he was one of the sponsors of a book by Dr John Webster entitled The Displaying of Supposed Witchcraft, which exposed the fallacies of the belief in witchcraft and played a large part in the cessation of prosecutions for witchcraft./nBoth Sir Jonas Moore and his son were buried in the Church of St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower of London.[15]/nJohn Aubrey's biography of Moore, written a year or two after his death, characterised him as \"a good mathematician and a good fellowe\", that is a man given to drink every day wine with company. Among such company would be Samuel Pepys, who recorded one such session in the Rhenish wine house on 23 May 1661 \"...and there came Jonas Moore, the mathematician, to us, and there he did by discourse make us fully believe that England and France were once the same continent, by very good arguments, and spoke very many things, not so much to prove the Scripture false as that the time therein is not well computed nor understood.\" Only a casual acquaintance in the 1660s, Pepys counted him \"my Worthy Friend\" when both were governors of the Mathematics School.[16]/nTwo of Moore's friends, Sir Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke, were also associated with the Royal Observatory. Moore and Hooke were among a small group that met at Wren's house as the \"New Philosophicall Club\" in 1676, at a time when the public's opinion of philosophers and the Royal Society was at a low ebb.[17] Moore always looked for tangible results from Flamsteed's work at Greenwich: in July 1678, Moore threatened to stop Flamsteed's salary and compared his lack of published results unfavourably with the recent work by Edmond Halley.[18]", "64543043": "Martina Z\u00e4hle (born 1950)[1] is a German mathematician specializing in geometric measure theory and stochastic geometry.

Halton put up sundials at Wingfield Manor; and a letter written from Gray's Inn in May 1650, describing a dial of his own invention, was published in the appendix to Samuel Foster's Miscellanea, London, 1659. Halton made several alterations and improvements in Wingfield Manor, and repaired the damage inflicted upon it by the Civil War. It remained in his family until the nineteenth century./nHaving heard of Flamsteed's astronomical proficiency, Halton called to see him at Derby in 1666, and afterwards sent him Giovanni Battista Riccioli's New Almagest, Johannes Kepler's Rudolphine Tables, and other books on astronomy. Flamsteed calles him a good algebraist. Halton's observations at Wingfield on the solar eclipse of 23 June 1675 were communicated to the Royal Society by Flamsteed.[1] In a letter to John Collins of 20 February 1673 Flamsteed mentioned that Halton was then translating Gerard Kinkhuysen's Moon-Wiser into English for him. A little later he speaks of observing with his quadrants, and on 27 December 1673 told Collins that 'lately, in discourse with Mr. Halton, he was pleased to show me a straight-lined projection for finding the hour by inspection, the sun's declination and height being given'./nHe married Mary, daughter of John Newton of Oakerthorpe in Derbyshire, and had by her three sons, two of whom left children.

He actively participated in the Scandinavian Congress of Mathematicians held in 1925 and 1927.[5] His contributions were instrumental in fostering the development of mathematics in Iceland, which ultimately led to Iceland becoming a full member of the Nordic Congress of Mathematicians in the 1980s.[5]/nHe published several papers in the Danish Matematisk Tidsskrift, with notable contributions in the years 1926, 1940, 1945, and 1948.[3] His research work also appeared in esteemed journals such as Mathematische Annalen, specifically in volumes 102 (1930), 109 (1934), 113 (1937), and 114 (1937).[3]/nIn 1925, Dan\u00edelsson participated in the Sixth Scandinavian Congress of Mathematicians held in Copenhagen.[3] Two years later, in 1927, he also attended the seventh congress held in Oslo.[3] He delivered presentations at both congresses, accompanied by the publication of his papers. His first paper, titled \"En L\u00f6sning af Malfattis problem\" [A solution of Malfatti's Problem], was published in Matematisk Tidsskrift. Subsequently, he contributed to Matematische Annalen with a paper entitled \"\u00dcberkorrespondierende Punkte der Steinerschen Fl\u00e4che vierter Ordnung und die Hauptpunkte derselben\" (Corresponding Points of Steiner's Surface of Fourth Order and their Principal Points). This journal featured the works of renowned mathematicians such as Einstein, van der Waerden, von Neumann, Landau, Ore, and Kolmogorov, among others, and Dan\u00edelsson's paper was among the 44 articles published.[3] It is worth noting that Danielsson was the only mathematician from Iceland contributing to Scandinavian Mathematicial journals before the second world war.[6]/nDan\u00edelsson's fascination with elementary geometry was evident, as he remarked that \"it is difficult to find tasks simpler and more elegant than skillful mathematical problems.\" His final paper was published in both the Journal of the Icelandic Society of Engineers in 1946 and Matematisk Tidsskrift in 1948.[3]/nOn 31 October 1947, the Icelandic Mathematical Society was founded in Reykjavik when Dan\u00edelsson was 70. The society records:/n\u201cOn Friday, 31 October 1947, which was the seventieth birthday of \u00d3lafur Dan\u00edelsson, he gathered in his home several men and set up a Society. The purpose of the Society is to promote co-operation and promotion of people in Iceland who have completed a university degree in a mathematical subject. The Society holds meetings at which individual members explain their mathematical topics and, if desired, discussions on the topic will be conducted.\u201d[7]/nThe first lecture was delivered by \u00d3lafur Dan\u00edelsson himself.[2] He spoke \"about the circle transcribed by the outer circumference of the triangle\" and calculated its length relative to the radius of the inscribed circle and the circumference of the triangle. This result has been published in the Matematisk Tidsskrift.[2] However, this had been a longstanding interest of him, as the initial foundations of this subject could be traced back to an article he wrote in 1900, published in the same journal.[2] In this regard, the topic itself carried a sense of antiquity, yet it had recently witnessed a fresh comprehension shortly before his presentation.[2]", "38164836": "James Andrew Clarkson (7 February 1906 \u2013 6 June 1970) was an American mathematician and professor of mathematics who specialized in number theory.

This amounts to a non-dialogical interpretation of logical constants via the effect of elimination rules over introduction rules, which finds a parallel in Paul Lorenzen's and Jaakko Hintikka's dialogue/game-semantics. This led to a type theory called \"Meaning as Use Type Theory\".[2] In reference to the use of Wittgenstein's dictum, he has shown that the aspect concerning the explanation of the consequences of a proposition is present since a very early date when in a letter to Bertrand Russell, where Wittgenstein refers to the universal quantifier only having meaning when one sees what follows from it.[3]/nSince later in the 1990s, Ruy de Queiroz has been engaged, jointly with Dov Gabbay, in a program of providing a general account of the functional interpretation of classical and non-classical logics via the notion of labeled natural deduction.

He was home-tutored from an early age, and was not enrolled in school until 1810. Following a short period at the Royal Frederick University, which included a stint as assistant to Christopher Hansteen, Holmboe was hired as a mathematics teacher at the Christiania Cathedral School in 1818, where he met the future renowned mathematician Niels Henrik Abel. Holmboe's lasting impact on mathematics worldwide has been said to be his tutoring of Abel, both in school and privately. The two became friends and remained so until Abel's early death. Holmboe moved to the Royal Frederick University in 1826, where he worked until his own death in 1850./nHolmboe's significant impact on mathematics in the fledgling Norway was his textbook in two volumes for secondary schools. It was widely used, but faced competition from Christopher Hansteen's alternative offering, sparking what may have been Norway's first debate about school textbooks.[2]/nBernt Michael Holmboe was born in Vang[1] in 1795, the son of vicar Jens Holmboe (1746\u20131823) and his wife Cathrine Holst (1763\u20131823). He grew up in Eidsberg with his nine siblings, and was the elder brother of noted philologist Christopher Andreas Holmboe. Holmboe was homeschooled from an early age, but was sent to the Christiania Cathedral School in 1810 to complete his secondary education. There he undertook extracurricular studies in mathematics. He enrolled as a student at the Royal Frederick University in 1814, a turbulent year in Norwegian history. Norway had been a province of Denmark since 1397, but had come under Swedish control in the January 1814 Treaty of Kiel. Following Norway's declaration of independence in the Constitution of 17 May, Sweden responded by waging a military campaign against Norway during the summer of 1814. Holmboe was a spokesperson for the student group opposed to the presence of Swedish troops in the country.[3] Any outspokenness from the student community was highly visible at the time, as the university had only seventeen students as of 1813, its year of establishment.[4]/nAs well as his private studies, Holmboe attended lectures given by S\u00f8ren Rasmusen. In 1815 he was appointed to the position of scientific assistant under Christopher Hansteen, a lecturer at the university, and delivered some lectures himself. In early 1818, Holmboe became a mathematics teacher at the Christiania Cathedral School, a position that had become vacant in 1817. The school principal, Jacob Rosted, had invited Holmboe's brother, Christopher Andreas, who had also studied mathematics, to take up the position, but he had decided instead to concentrate on philology; Christopher went on to research the Sanskrit language among others. In his teaching, Holmboe drew inspiration from Joseph-Louis Lagrange.[3]/nAt the Christiania Cathedral School, Holmboe met Niels Henrik Abel, then a pupil there.[3] Holmboe quickly discovered Abel's talent, and proclaimed him as a \"splendid genius\" in his report card.[quote 1][5] The school's primary focus was on classical education and Latin, and so Holmboe tutored Abel privately. His personal support for Abel has been called \"[Holmboe's] most important contribution to mathematics\".[quote 2][3]/nHolmboe and Abel became close friends. Two of Holmboe's younger brothers studied with Abel, and the three were also on friendly terms. Abel was invited to the Holmboe family residence in Eidsberg on several occasions, including to celebrate Christmas.[3]/nAbel died from tuberculosis in 1829, at the age of twenty-six.[6] Ten years after Abel's death Holmboe edited and published his complete works in two volumes\u2014Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes de N.H. Abel ('Complete Works of N.H. Abel').[3] He was the first to do so.[2]/nHolmboe published his first textbook in mathematics in 1825. The 274-page book was named L\u00e6rebog i Mathematiken. F\u00f8rste Deel (Textbook in Mathematics. Part One). In 1827 he followed with the second volume, L\u00e6rebog i Mathematiken. Anden Deel (Textbook in Mathematics. Part Two), consisting of a further 155 pages. He used his own teaching experience as the background for his writing; mainly abstract, the purpose of the books was to instill logical thinking. For instance, in the field geometry, it enticed readers to envisage a figure instead of putting it to paper. The books became widely used, and were reprinted in four and five volumes respectively.[3]/nIn 1826, Holmboe was appointed a lecturer at the Royal Frederick University.[3] Some claimed that he owed his appointment to Abel's absence, as the latter was travelling around in Europe at that time.[6] Holmboe also taught mathematics at a military college, from 1826 until his death, and was promoted to professor at the Royal Frederick University in 1834. His later publications include Stereometrie (Stereometry) (1833), Plan- og sf\u00e6risk Trigonometrie (Plan and Spherical Trigonometry) (1834), and L\u00e6rebog i den h\u00f8iere Mathematik (Textbook of Advanced Mathematics) (1849). Holmboe was an influence on other mathematicians as well as Abel, including Ole Jacob Broch (born 1818).[3]/nAt the university, Holmboe again met Christopher Hansteen, who had become a professor there in 1816. In 1835, Hansteen published his own mathematics textbook for secondary schools. A reaction to Holmboe's books and method of teaching, it was more practically oriented. Holmboe wrote a review of the book for the newspaper Morgenbladet, in which he advised schools not to use it. A public debate followed, with contributions from other mathematicians. It has been claimed that this was the first debate on the subject of school textbooks in Norway.[3] Hansteen's textbook was not reprinted.[3]/nHolmboe also became involved in the field of insurance. From 1832 to 1848 he was a member of Tilsynskomiteen for private fors\u00f8rgelses- og underst\u00f8ttelsesselskaper, the country's first public committee for the supervision of insurance companies. On the other side of the table, from 1847 Holmboe was a member of the board of directors of the insurance company Gjensidige, founded by his former student Ole Jacob Broch.[3]/nA Bernt Michael Holmboe Memorial Prize for teachers of mathematics was established in 2005, and is awarded annually.

They had three daughters, two of whom (Fredrikke and Nikoline, Jr.) reached adulthood, and one stillborn son. He married his second wife, Ingeborg Thorp in 1842. She was born in 1812 in Voss. This marriage produced two sons, Christopher and Jens, and two daughters, Cathrine and Olava.

He also taught at several other universities./nHis son, also called John Myhill, is a professor of linguistics in the English department of the University of Haifa in Israel.[3]/nIn the theory of formal languages, the Myhill\u2013Nerode theorem, proven by Myhill[4] and Anil Nerode,[5] characterizes the regular languages as the languages that have only finitely many inequivalent prefixes./nIn computability theory, the Rice\u2013Myhill\u2013Shapiro theorem,[6] more commonly known as Rice's theorem, states that, for any nontrivial property P of partial functions, it is undecidable to determine whether a given Turing machine computes a function with property P. The Myhill isomorphism theorem is a computability-theoretic analogue of the Cantor\u2013Bernstein\u2013Schroeder theorem that characterizes the recursive isomorphisms of pairs of sets./nIn the theory of cellular automata, Myhill is known for proving (along with E. F. Moore) the Garden of Eden theorem, stating that a cellular automaton has a configuration with no predecessor if and only if it has two different asymptotic configurations which evolve to the same configuration. He is also known for posing the firing squad synchronization problem of designing an automaton that, starting from a single non-quiescent cell, evolves to a configuration in which all cells reach the same non-quiescent state at the same time; this problem was again solved by Moore./nIn constructive set theory, Myhill is known for proposing an axiom system that avoids the axiom of choice and the law of the excluded middle, known as intuitionistic Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel. He also developed a constructive set theory based on natural numbers, functions, and sets, rather than (as in many other foundational theories) basing it purely on sets./nThe Russell\u2013Myhill paradox or Russell\u2013Myhill antinomy, discovered by Bertrand Russell in 1902 (and discussed in his The Principles of Mathematics, 1903)[7][8] and rediscovered by Myhill in 1958,[9] concerns systems of logic in which logical propositions can be members of classes, and can also be about classes; for instance, a proposition P can \"state the product\" of a class C, meaning that proposition P asserts that all propositions contained in class C are true. In such a system, the class of propositions that state the product of classes that do not include them is paradoxical. For, if proposition P states the product of this class, an inconsistency arises regardless of whether P does or does not belong to the class it describes.[7]/nIn music theory, Myhill's property is a mathematical property of musical scales described by John Clough and Gerald Myerson and named by them after Myhill.", "31840693": "Martin Thomas Barlow FRS FRSC (born 16 June 1953 in London) is a British mathematician who is professor of mathematics at the University of British Columbia in Canada since 1992.[1]/nBarlow is the son of Andrew Dalmahoy Barlow (1916\u20132006) and his wife Yvonne.[2] He is thus the grandson of Alan Barlow, and his wife Nora (n\u00e9e Darwin), through whom he is a great-great-grandson of Charles Darwin.

The title of his doctoral thesis was Topics in the Theory of Uniqueness of Trigonometrical Series.[5]/nIn 1957, before the award of his doctorate, Cohen was appointed as an Instructor in Mathematics at the University of Rochester for a year.

These were years in which Cohen made a number of significant mathematical breakthroughs. In Factorization in group algebras (1959) he showed that any integrable function on a locally compact group is the convolution of two such functions, solving a problem posed by Walter Rudin. In Cohen (1960) he made a significant breakthrough in solving the Littlewood conjecture.[6]/nCohen was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,[7] the United States National Academy of Sciences,[8] and the American Philosophical Society.[9] On June 2, 1995, Cohen received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Science and Technology at Uppsala University, Sweden.[10]/nCohen is noted for developing a mathematical technique called forcing, which he used to prove that neither the continuum hypothesis (CH) nor the axiom of choice can be proved from the standard Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms (ZF) of set theory. In conjunction with the earlier work of G\u00f6del, this showed that both of these statements are logically independent of the ZF axioms: these statements can be neither proved nor disproved from these axioms. In this sense, the continuum hypothesis is undecidable, and it is the most widely known example of a natural statement that is independent from the standard ZF axioms of set theory./nFor his result on the continuum hypothesis, Cohen won the Fields Medal in mathematics in 1966, and also the National Medal of Science in 1967.[11] The Fields Medal that Cohen won continues to be the only Fields Medal to be awarded for a work in mathematical logic, as of 2022./nApart from his work in set theory, Cohen also made many valuable contributions to analysis. He was awarded the B\u00f4cher Memorial Prize in mathematical analysis in 1964 for his paper \"On a conjecture by Littlewood and idempotent measures\",[12] and lends his name to the Cohen\u2013Hewitt factorization theorem./nCohen was a full professor of mathematics at Stanford University. He was an Invited Speaker at the ICM in 1962 in Stockholm and in 1966 in Moscow./nAngus MacIntyre of the Queen Mary University of London stated about Cohen: \"He was dauntingly clever, and one would have had to be naive or exceptionally altruistic to put one's 'hardest problem' to the Paul I knew in the '60s.\" He went on to compare Cohen to Kurt G\u00f6del, saying: \"Nothing more dramatic than their work has happened in the history of the subject.\"[13] G\u00f6del himself wrote a letter to Cohen in 1963, a draft of which stated, \"Let me repeat that it is really a delight to read your proof of the ind[ependence] of the cont[inuum] hyp[othesis]. I think that in all essential respects you have given the best possible proof & this does not happen frequently. Reading your proof had a similarly pleasant effect on me as seeing a really good play.\"[14]/nWhile studying the continuum hypothesis, Cohen is quoted as saying in 1985 that he had \"had the feeling that people thought the problem was hopeless, since there was no new way of constructing models of set theory. Indeed, they thought you had to be slightly crazy even to think about the problem.\"[15]/nA point of view which the author [Cohen] feels may eventually come to be accepted is that CH is obviously false. The main reason one accepts the axiom of infinity is probably that we feel it absurd to think that the process of adding only one set at a time can exhaust the entire universe. Similarly with the higher axioms of infinity. Now \n\n\n\n\n\u2135\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\aleph _{1}}\n\n is the cardinality of the set of countable ordinals, and this is merely a special and the simplest way of generating a higher cardinal. The set \n\n\n\nC\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C}\n\n [the continuum] is, in contrast, generated by a totally new and more powerful principle, namely the power set axiom. It is unreasonable to expect that any description of a larger cardinal which attempts to build up that cardinal from ideas deriving from the replacement axiom can ever reach \n\n\n\nC\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C}\n\n./nThus \n\n\n\nC\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C}\n\n is greater than \n\n\n\n\n\u2135\n\nn\n\n\n,\n\n\u2135\n\n\u03c9\n\n\n,\n\n\u2135\n\na\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\aleph _{n},\\aleph _{\\omega },\\aleph _{a}}\n\n, where \n\n\n\na\n=\n\n\u2135\n\n\u03c9\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a=\\aleph _{\\omega }}\n\n, etc. This point of view regards \n\n\n\nC\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C}\n\n as an incredibly rich set given to us by one bold new axiom, which can never be approached by any piecemeal process of construction. Perhaps later generations will see the problem more clearly and express themselves more eloquently./nAn \"enduring and powerful product\" of Cohen's work on the continuum hypothesis, and one that has been used by \"countless mathematicians\"[15] is known as \"forcing\", and it is used to construct mathematical models to test a given hypothesis for truth or falsehood./nShortly before his death, Cohen gave a lecture describing his solution to the problem of the continuum hypothesis at the 2006 G\u00f6del centennial conference in Vienna.[16]/nCohen and his wife, Christina (n\u00e9e Karls), had three sons.

Oughtred invented horizontal and circular forms of the slide rule, and Forster persuaded his master to let him translate his writings about their form and use, and to publish them. The publication resulted in a controversy, because another student of Oughtred's, Richard Delamain the elder, during the two years (1630-32) in which Forster was preparing the book, brought out two treatises on the same subject claiming the inventions as his own, and addressing himself to royal patronage.[2][3] Forster's work was dedicated to that eminent intellectual, Sir Kenelm Digby (1603-1665), and the account of Oughtred's claim is found in Forster's Preface, or Letter of Dedication. Following the invention or discovery of logarithms by John Napier, in his Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio of 1614, the translation of that work by Edward Wright (1561-1615), and Henry Briggs's Arithmetica Logarithmica of 1624, the development of the slide rule had an important impact on the teaching of mathematics.[4]/nForster, of whose life little is known, stated in 1632 that he owed his initiation and whole progress in the mathematical sciences to his worthy friend and teacher, Mr. William Oughtred.[5] Oughtred himself described how he had trained Forster in precepts before letting him become familiar with instruments:/n\"As I did to Delamain and to some others, so I did to William Forster: I freely gave him my helpe and instruction in these faculties: only this was the difference, I had the very first moulding (as I may say) of this latter: But Delamain was already corrupted with doting upon Instruments, and quite lost from ever being made an Artist: I suffered not William Forster for some time so much as speake of any Instrument, except only the Globe it selfe; and to explicate, and worke the questions of the Sphaere, by the way of the Analemma: which also himselfe did describe for the present occasion. And this my restraint from such pleasing avocations, and holding him to the strictnesse of precept, brought forth this fruit, that in short time, even by his owne skill, he could not onely use any Instrument he should see, but also was able to delineate the like, and devise others: yet for all this my severe hand I saw him obliquely to glaunce his eye upon such Instrumentary practices: whereat I being jealous, lest I should lose my labour, and he his end, which was Art: I brake out into that admonition which in his Epistle Dedicatory to Sir Kenelme Digby he (I thinke in my very formall words) setteth downe.\"[6]/nWhile staying at Oughtred's residence at Albury, Surrey during the long vacation of 1630, Forster asked him about an instrument he had heard of, a Ruler to find numbers, sines and tangents. This instrument was said to be six feet long (like the instrument called \"Mr Gunter's Ruler\"), and was used with a pair of beam compasses. Oughtred told him that that was a poor invention, and difficult to use. \"But\", said he, \"seeing you are taken with such mechanicall wayes of Instruments, I will shew you what devises I haue had by mee these many yeares.\"[5]/nHe first showed to Forster a rule (a \"horizontal instrument\") consisting of two straight rulers used together without the need for compasses, and secondly a circular slide rule consisting of a circle or ring so marked, with another moveable circle upon it. (These could be used for delineating sundials upon any kind of plane and for demonstrating astronomical principles.) Forster was strongly impressed, and told Oughtred he was surprised that he should have kept these valuable inventions hidden for \"so many yeares\", both from the world, and from himself, to whom his teacher had otherwise been so liberal in explaining the aspects and mysteries of his Art.[5]/nOughtred replied:/n\"That the true way of Art is not by Instruments, but by Demonstration: and that it is a preposterous course of vulgar Teachers, to begin with Instruments, and not with the Sciences, and so in-stead of Artists, to make their Schollers only doers of tricks, and as it were Iuglers: to the despite of Art, losse of precious time, and betraying of willing and industrious wits, unto ignorance, and idlenesse. That the use of Instruments is indeed excellent, if a man be an Artist: but contemptible, being set and opposed to Art. And lastly, that he meant to commend to me, the skill of Instruments, but first he would have me well instructed in the Sciences.\"[5]/nAccording to Forster's Letter of Dedication (addressed to Sir Kenelm Digby), Oughtred claimed to have projected the \"Horizontall Instrument\" about thirty years previously (i.e. around 1600), and showed Forster his many notes and instructions for the use of both instruments, mainly written in Latin. Forster persuaded him to make them public, and was given the author's permission to translate and publish Oughtred's treatise as The Circles of Proportion and the Horizontall Instrument. Both invented, and the uses of both written in Latine by Mr. W. O. Translated into English and set forth for the publique benefit by William Forster (1632, another edition in 1639).[5][7]/nThis project (Forster also noted), while he was carefully working on it (1630-1632), \"another to whom the Author in a loving confidence discovered this intent, using more hast then good speed, went about to preocupate [i.e., anticipate]; of which untimely birth, and preventing (if not circumventing) forwardnesse, I say no more: but advise the studious Reader, onely so farre to trust, as he shal be sure doth agree to truth and Art.\"[5] This led to a dispute over the claimed invention, between Forster, Oughtred, and Richard Delamaine the elder, another of Oughtred's students.[2][7][8]/nThe anticipatative works were Delamain's Grammelogia, or, The mathematical ring extracted from the logarythmes, and projected circular (printed 1631, dedicated to King Charles I),[9] and his The Making, Description, and Use of a small portable Instrument called a Horizontall Quadrant (printed 1632, dedicated to the Lord Brudenell, Baron of Stonton).[10] According to Oughtred, Delamain was bringing him the printed sheets of his works as they were being prepared, and disregarded Oughtred's criticisms of them.[6]/nIt was in an address To the courteous and benevolent Reader, prefixed to the two volumes bound together, that Delamain took the bait of criticism, writing:/n\"Too great and too loose an aspertion hath bin cast upon me about these things, which I never thought in the least title when I first writ upon this Invention, or my name so to come to the worlds rumor as it hath since the last publication of this Logarythmall projection Circular; howsoever, here is my comfort, the guiltlesnesse and innocency of my cause, which may teach me, and others carefulnesse hereafter, how and what we publish to the world, seeing there are such carpers, and maligners even of the most usefull and best things, yea, such busie bodies who marre that which others make, who scorne to have a second, knowing all things and admiring nothing but themselves, such who have stings like Bees, and Arrowes alwayes ready to shoot against these whom they dislike, such who while they will needs have many callings neglect their owne; sharpe wittie cryticks, Diogenes like, snarling at others, and not looking home unto themselves, but by all meanes endevouring to take away the mantle of peace, and rent the seamelesse coate of love and amitie. If things be not done well by others then they triumph and send forth their invectives, if well, they professe it nothing, and cannot passe without their censure. To speake ill of a man upon knowledge shewes want of Charity; but to raise a scandall upon a bare supposition, and to act it in Print, argueth little humanity, lesse Christianity...\"[11]/nOughtred responded at length in his Just Apologie (c. 1634), setting forth his own biography to show his precedence in the matter, and noting \"Onely I will soberly tell you that William Forster, whom you call a Parrat speaking he cannot tell what, is a farre more grounded Artist in all parts of the Mathematicks then is R. D: and better knoweth what belongeth to demonstration then R.

It was republished in 1673, with an engraved portrait of the author,[12] This work shows Forster using the Rule of Multiplication based upon the symbol \"X\", said to have been introduced by Oughtred.[13] A new edition by Henry Coley appeared in 1686; this suggests that Forster died between the publication of the second and third editions.[2]", "58612227": "Josephine Dianne Edwards (18 August 1942 \u2013 25 May 1985) was an Australian mathematician and mathematics educator who founded the Australian Mathematics Competition./nEdwards was born in Oxford and was educated at the Ursuline School in Brentwood.

In 1815 he interrupted his studies at Berlin to serve as a volunteer in the Hundred Days against Napoleon, and was wounded in the Battle of Ligny. Subsequently, he entered Berlin University as a student of theology, but soon turned to scientific subjects. His earlier papers were mostly concerned with crystallography, and the reputation they gained him led to his appointment as Privatdozent at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg, where in 1828 he became extraordinary, and in 1829 ordinary, professor of mineralogy and physics. His 1831 study on the specific heats of compounds included what is now known as Neumann's Law: the molecular heat of a compound is equal to the sum of the atomic heats of its constituents.[1]/nDevoting himself next to optics, he produced memoirs which earned him a high place among early searchers of a true dynamical theory of light. In 1832, by the aid of a particular hypothesis as to the constitution of the ether, he reached by a rigorous dynamical calculation results agreeing with those obtained by Augustin Louis Cauchy, and succeeded in deducing laws of double refraction closely resembling those of Augustin-Jean Fresnel.[1]  In studying double refraction, with his deduction of the elastic constants (on which the optical properties depend) Neumann employed the assumption that the symmetry of the elastic behavior of a crystal was equal to that of its form.  In other words, he assumed that the magnitudes of the components of a physical property in symmetric positions are equivalent.  This assumption substantially reduced the number of independent constants and greatly simplified the elastic equations.   However, four decades passed before Neumann elaborated his application of symmetry in a course on elasticity in 1873. This principle was later formalized by his student Woldemar Voigt (1850\u20131918) in 1885: \"the symmetry of the physical phenomenon is at least as high as the crystallographic symmetry\", which became a fundamental postulate of crystal physics known as Neumann\u2019s principle. In 1900, Voigt attributed this principle to Neumann's 1832 paper even though, at most, all that was present in that work was an implicit assumption that the symmetry of the phenomenon was equal to that of the crystal. Bernhard Minnigerode (1837\u20131896), another student of Neumann, first expressed this relation in written form in 1887 in the journal Neues Jahrb. Mineral Geol. Paleontol. (Vol. 5, p.\u00a0145).[2]/nLater, Neumann attacked the problem of giving mathematical expression to the conditions holding for a surface separating two crystalline media, and worked out from theory the laws of double refraction in strained crystalline bodies. He also made important contributions to the mathematical theory of electrodynamics, and in papers published in 1845 and 1847 established mathematically the laws of the induction of electric currents.[3] His last publication, which appeared in 1878, was on spherical harmonics (Beitr\u00e4ge zur Theorie der Kugelfunctionen).[1]/nWith the mathematician Carl Gustav Jacobi, he founded in 1834 the Mathematisch-physikalisches Seminar which operated in two sections for mathematics and for mathematical physics. Not every student took both sections. In his section on mathematical physics Neumann taught mathematical methods as well as the techniques of an exact experimental physics grounded in the type of precision measurement perfected by his astronomer colleague Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel. The objective of his seminar exercises was to perfect one's ability to practice an exact experimental physics through the control of both constant and random experimental errors. Only a few students actually produced original research in the seminar; a notable exception was Gustav Robert Kirchhoff who formulated Kirchhoff's Laws on the basis of his seminar research. This seminar was the model for many others of the same type established after 1834, including Kirchhoff's own at Heidelberg University./nNeumann retired from his professorship in 1876, and died at K\u00f6nigsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) in 1895 at the age of 96./nHis son Carl Gottfried Neumann became in 1858 Privatdozent, and in 1863 extraordinary professor of mathematics at Halle; his younger son Franz Ernst Christian Neumann became professor of medicine in K\u00f6nigsberg.", "383501": "Erich K\u00e4hler (German: [\u02c8k\u025b\u02d0l\u0250] \u24d8; 16 January 1906 \u2013 31 May 2000) was a German mathematician with wide-ranging interests in geometry and mathematical physics, who laid important mathematical groundwork for algebraic geometry and for string theory./nErich K\u00e4hler was born in Leipzig, the son of a telegraph inspector Ernst K\u00e4hler. Inspired as a boy to be an explorer after reading books about Sven Hedin that his mother Elsa G\u00f6tsch had given to him, the young K\u00e4hler soon focused his passion for exploration on astronomy. He is said to have written a 50-page thesis on fractional differentiation while still in high school, hoping that it would earn him a PhD. His teachers replied that he would have to attend university courses first.[1]/nK\u00e4hler enrolled in the University of Leipzig in 1924. He read Galois theory, met the mathematician Emil Artin, and did research under the supervision of Leon Lichtenstein. Still fascinated by celestial mechanics, K\u00e4hler wrote a dissertation entitled On the existence of equilibrium solutions of rotating liquids, which are derived from certain solutions of the n-body problem, and received his doctorate in 1928.[2] He continued his studies at Leipzig for the following year, supported by fellowship from the Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaften, except for a research assistantship at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg in 1929. In 1930 K\u00e4hler joined the Department of Mathematics at the University of Hamburg to work under the direction of Wilhelm Blaschke, writing a habilitation thesis entitled, \"About the integrals of algebraic equations\". He took a year in Rome to work with Italian geometers including Enriques, Castelnuovo, Levi-Civita, Severi, and Segre in 1931-1932,[1] which led him to publish his acclaimed work on what are now called K\u00e4hler metrics in 1932.[3] K\u00e4hler returned to Hamburg after his year in Rome, where he continued to work until going to the University of Konigsberg in 1935, and was offered an ordinary professorship a year later. In 1938 he married his first wife Luise G\u00fcnther.[1]/nIn the years leading up to World War II K\u00e4hler was a supporter of Hitler and of German nationalism, and reported that he volunteered for the German military in 1935, joined the navy in 1937, and the army on 24 August 1939 before the invasion of Poland.[4] After being stationed at the Saint-Nazaire submarine base in German Occupied France towards the end of the war, K\u00e4hler was captured by the Allies and taken to the prisoner of war camp at Ile de R\u00e9, and then to another camp in Mulsanne. Thanks to the French physicist Frederic Joliot-Curie and mathematician \u00c9lie Cartan, K\u00e4hler was able to study mathematics during this time, receiving books and mathematics papers and working during his imprisonment. He was released in 1947.[5] He reported that his oath to Hitler (as a civil servant) was important to him, and remained an apologist for the Third Reich decades later, in a 1988 interview with Sanford Segal.[4] A former student reported in 1988 that he kept a Nazi navy flag in his office.[4]/nAfter his release as a prisoner of war K\u00e4hler returned to the University of Hamburg to take up a temporary lectureship. He accepted a professorship in 1948 at his alma mater the University of Leipzig, filling a post that had been left open by the death of Paul Koebe in 1945. But in this same year, Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative in the region to German communist leaders, and from October 1949 the region was a part of newly-formed East Germany. K\u00e4hler became increasingly unhappy with life in East Germany over the next decade, finally deciding to leave in 1958 to take up a lectureship at the Technical University of Berlin. There he was heralded as among the greatest living mathematicians, and his lectures overflowed with 600 students from engineering and the sciences.[6] In 1964 he returned to the University of Hamburg to fill the post that opened when Artin died in 1962. His wife Luise became ill and died in 1970, and K\u00e4hler married his second wife Charlotte Schulze, who was the widow of his brother who had died in the war. K\u00e4hler remained at the University of Hamburg until his retirement in 1974.[1]/nAfter retiring K\u00e4hler remained an active researcher, writing a number of important papers on the foundations of physics and the Poincar\u00e9 group, as well as a number of philosophical papers.[5]/nAs a mathematician K\u00e4hler is known for a number of contributions: the Cartan\u2013K\u00e4hler theorem on solutions of non-linear analytic differential systems; the idea of a K\u00e4hler metric on complex manifolds; and the K\u00e4hler differentials, which provide a purely algebraic theory and have generally been adopted in algebraic geometry. In all of these the theory of differential forms plays a part, and K\u00e4hler counts as a major developer of the theory from its formal genesis with \u00c9lie Cartan./nK\u00e4hler manifolds \u2014 complex manifolds endowed with a Riemannian metric and a symplectic form so that the three structures are mutually compatible \u2014 are named after him./nThe K3 surface is named after Kummer, K\u00e4hler, and Kodaira./nHis earlier work was on celestial mechanics; and he was one of the forerunners of scheme theory, though his ideas on that were never widely adopted.", "875025": "Giacomo Inaudi (13 October 1867[1] \u2013 10 November 1950), also known as Jacques Inaudi in France, was an Italian calculating prodigy./nHe was born in Roccabruna, Piedmont, Italy.

The \"concept image\" is a notion in cognitive theory. It consists of all the cognitive structure in the individual's mind that is associated with a given concept. Tall and Vinner point out that the concept image may not be globally coherent, and may have aspects which are quite different from the formal concept definition. They study the development of limits and continuity, as taught in secondary school and university, from the cognitive viewpoint, and report on investigations which exhibit individual concept images differing from the formal theory, and containing factors which cause cognitive conflict.[1]/nTall is also known within mathematics education for his longstanding collaboration with Eddie Gray. This partnership, based at the Mathematics Education Research Centre at the University of Warwick, resulted in the theoretically important notion of procept. Gray and Tall (1994) noted that mathematical symbolism often ambiguously refers to both process and concept, and that successful learners must be able to flexibly move between these different interpretations.[2]/nIn recent years Tall has been working on what he calls 'three fundamentally different ways of operation' in mathematics, 'one through physical embodiment, including physical action and the use of visual and other senses, a second through the use of mathematical symbols that operate as process and concept (procepts) in arithmetic, algebra and symbolic calculus, and a third through formal mathematics in advanced mathematical thinking'.[3] These three ways have become known as Tall\u2019s Three Worlds of Mathematics: (conceptual) embodied; (operational) symbolic; and, (axiomatic) formal (see http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/David.Tall/themes/three-worlds.html)./nIn the book commissioned by the International Group for the Psychology of Mathematics Education to review mathematics education research between 1976\u20132006, Tall was revealed to be the most cited mathematics education researcher in the book, with 55 cites to his name (Guti\u00e9rrez & Boero, 2006).[4]", "8542807": "Li Shanlan (\u674e\u5584\u862d, courtesy name: Renshu \u58ec\u53d4, art name: Qiuren \u79cb\u7d09) (1810 \u2013 1882) was a Chinese mathematician of the Qing Dynasty./nA native of Haining, Zhejiang, he was fascinated by mathematics since childhood, beginning with the Nine Chapters on Mathematical Art.

His early work with Hugh Woodin included showing that it is consistent that the generalized continuum hypothesis (see continuum hypothesis) fails at every infinite cardinal.[4] In joint work with Menachem Magidor and Saharon Shelah he formulated Martin's maximum, a provably maximal form of Martin's axiom and showed its consistency.[5][6] Foreman's later work in set theory was primarily concerned with developing the consequences of generic large cardinal axioms.[7] He also worked on classical \"Hungarian\" partition relations, mostly with Andr\u00e1s Hajnal.[8]/nIn the late 1980s Foreman became interested in measure theory and ergodic theory. With Randall Dougherty he settled the Marczewski problem (1930) by showing that there is a Banach\u2013Tarski decomposition of the unit ball in which all pieces have the property of Baire (see Banach\u2013Tarski paradox).[9] A consequence is the existence of a decomposition of an open dense subset of the unit ball into disjoint open sets that can be rearranged by isometries to form two open dense subsets of the unit ball. With Friedrich Wehrung, Foreman showed that the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem implied the existence of a non-Lebesgue measurable set, even in the absence of any other form of the axiom of choice.[10]/nThis naturally led to attempts to apply the tools of descriptive set theory to classification problems in ergodic theory. His first work in this direction, with Ferenc Beleznay,[11] showed that classical collections were beyond the Borel hierarchy in complexity. This was followed shortly by a proof of the analogous results for measure-preserving transformations with generalized discrete spectrum. In a collaboration with Benjamin Weiss[12] and Daniel Rudolph[13] Foreman showed that no residual class of measure-preserving transformations can have algebraic invariants and that the isomorphism relation on ergodic measure-preserving transformations is not Borel. This negative result finished a program proposed by von Neumann in 1932.[14] This result was extended by Foreman and Weiss to show that smooth area-preserving diffeomorphisms of the 2-torus are unclassifiable./nForeman's work in set theory continued during this period. He co-edited (with Kanamori) the Handbook of Set Theory and showed that various combinatorial properties of \u03c92 and \u03c93 are equiconsistent with huge cardinals.[15]/nIn 1998 Foreman was an Invited Speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin.[16]/nIn 2021, he gave the G\u00f6del Lecture titled G\u00f6del Diffeomorphisms./nHe was named to the 2023 class of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, \"for contributions to axioms of mathematics, Banach-Tarski phenomena, and descriptive dynamical systems\".[17]", "547426": "Paolo Ruffini (22 September 1765 \u2013 10 May 1822) was an Italian mathematician and philosopher./nBy 1788 he had earned university degrees in philosophy, medicine/surgery and mathematics.

Mary challenged that by sitting in on the Council meeting in Atlantic City. When she was told she had to leave, she refused saying she would wait until the police came. (Mary relates the story somewhat differently: When she was told she had to leave, she responded she could find no rules in the by-laws restricting attendance at Council meetings.

At ten years of age he was placed in the care of an uncle at Durham, Thomas Walker (died 10 November 1763), successively minister at Cockermouth, 1732, Durham, 1736, and Mill Hill Chapel at Leeds, 1748. He attended the Durham School, by then \"a north-country public school of repute and wide influence\",[1] under Richard Dongworth. In the autumn of 1749, being then about fifteen, he was admitted to the dissenting academy at Kendal under Caleb Rotherham; here he met his lifelong friend, John Manning (1730\u20131806). On Rotherham's retirement (1751) he was for a short time under Hugh Moises at Newcastle-on-Tyne. In November 1751 he entered at Edinburgh University with Manning, where he studied mathematics under Matthew Stewart. He moved to Glasgow in 1752 for the sake of the divinity lectures of William Leechman, continued his mathematical studies under Robert Simson, and heard the lectures of Adam Smith, but found their private conversation more instructive. Among his classmates were Newcome Cappe, Nicholas Clayton, and John Millar, members with him of a college debating society./nLeaving Glasgow in 1754 without graduating, he did occasional preaching at Newcastle and Leeds, and injured his health by study; he recovered by a course of sea bathing. In 1766 he declined an invitation to succeed Robert Andrews as minister of Platt Chapel, Manchester, but later in the year accepted a call (in succession to Joseph Wilkinson) from his uncle's former Presbyterian flock at Durham, and was ordained there in 1757./nAt Durham he finished, but did not yet publish, his \u2018Doctrine of the Sphere,\u2019 begun in Edinburgh. With the signature P.M.D. (presbyterian minister, Durham) he contributed to the Ladies' Diary, then edited by Thomas Simpson. He left Durham at the beginning of 1762 to become minister at Filby, Norfolk, and assistant to John Whiteside (died 1784) at Great Yarmouth. Here he resumed his intimacy with Manning, now practising as a physician at Norwich. He began his treatise on conic sections, suggested to him by Isaac Newton's Arithmetica Universalis, 1707. He took pupils in mathematics and navigation. Through Richard Price he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society, and recommended to William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne for the post of his librarian, afterwards filled by Joseph Priestley, but declined it (1772) owing to his approaching marriage. He accepted in the same year the office of mathematical tutor at Warrington Academy, in succession to John Holt (died 1772). Here he prepared for the press his treatise on the sphere, himself cutting out all the illustrative figures (twenty thousand, for an edition of five hundred copies). It appeared in quarto in 1775, and was reissued in 1777. Joseph Johnson gave him \u00a340 for the copyright, returned by Walker on finding Johnson had lost money. The pay at Warrington did not answer his expectation. He resigned in two years, and in the autumn of 1774 became colleague to John Simpson (1746\u20131812) at High Pavement Chapel, Nottingham./nHere he remained for twenty-four years, developing in public work and as a pulpit orator. He reconciled a division in his congregation, founded a charity school (1788), and published a hymn-book. His colleagues after Simpson's retirement were (1778) Nathaniel Philipps (died 20 October 1842), the last dissenting minister who preached in a clerical wig (1785), Nicholas Clayton (1794), William Walters (died 11 April 1806). In conjunction with Gilbert Wakefield, who was in Nottingham from 1784 to 1790, he formed a literary club, meeting weekly at the members' houses. Nottingham was a focus of political opinion, which Walker led both by special sermons and by drafting petitions and addresses sent forward by the town in favour of the independence of the United States and the advocacy of parliamentary and other reforms. He won the commendation of Edmund Burke. His reform speech at the county meeting at Mansfield, 28 October 1782, was his greatest effort. William Henry Cavendish Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland compared him with Cicero. From 1787 he was chairman of the associated dissenters of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, and part of Yorkshire, whose object was to achieve the repeal of the Test Acts. His Dissenters' Plea, Birmingham (1790), was reckoned by Charles James Fox the best publication on the subject. He was an early advocate of the abolition of the slave trade. In 1794 he published  his treatise on conic sections, while he was agitating against measures for the suppression of public opinion, which culminated in the Seditious Meetings Act 1795./nTowards the close of 1797, after a fruitless application to Thomas Belsham, Walker was invited to succeed Thomas Barnes as professor of theology in Manchester College. He resigned his Nottingham charge on 5 May 1798. There was one other tutor, but the funds were low, and Walker's appeal (19 April 1799) for increased subscriptions met with little response. From 1800 the entire burden of teaching, including classics and mathematics, fell on him. In addition he took charge (1801\u20133) of the congregation at Dob Lane Chapel, Failsworth. He resigned in 1803, and the college moved to York./nWalker remained for two years in the neighbourhood of Manchester, and continued to take an active part in its Literary and Philosophical Society, of which he was elected president on the death of Thomas Percival. In 1805 he removed to Wavertree, near Liverpool, still keeping up a connection with Manchester. In the spring of 1807 he went to London on a publishing errand; he died at Draper Hall, London, on 21 April 1807, and was buried in Bunhill Fields./nAccording to Alexander Gordon in the Dictionary of National Biography, Walker's theology, a \u2018tempered Arianism,\u2019 played no part in his own compositions, but shows itself in omissions and alterations in his Collection of Psalms and Hymns,' Warrington, 1788.

His political and religious teachings were well known in Magna Graecia and influenced the philosophies of Plato, Aristotle, and, through them, the West in general. Knowledge of his life is clouded by legend. Modern scholars disagree regarding Pythagoras's education and influences, but they do agree that, around 530 BC, he travelled to Croton in southern Italy, where he founded a school in which initiates were sworn to secrecy and lived a communal, ascetic lifestyle. This lifestyle entailed a number of dietary prohibitions, traditionally said to have included aspects of vegetarianism.[5]/nThe teaching most securely identified with Pythagoras is metempsychosis, or the \"transmigration of souls\", which holds that every soul is immortal and, upon death, enters into a new body. He may have also devised the doctrine of musica universalis, which holds that the planets move according to mathematical equations and thus resonate to produce an inaudible symphony of music. Scholars debate whether Pythagoras developed the numerological and musical teachings attributed to him, or if those teachings were developed by his later followers, particularly Philolaus of Croton. Following Croton's decisive victory over Sybaris in around 510 BC, Pythagoras's followers came into conflict with supporters of democracy, and Pythagorean meeting houses were burned. Pythagoras may have been killed during this persecution, or he may have escaped to Metapontum and died there./nIn antiquity, Pythagoras was credited with many mathematical and scientific discoveries, including the Pythagorean theorem, Pythagorean tuning, the five regular solids, the Theory of Proportions, the sphericity of the Earth, and the identity of the morning and evening stars as the planet Venus. It was said that he was the first man to call himself a philosopher (\"lover of wisdom\")[c] and that he was the first to divide the globe into five climatic zones. Classical historians debate whether Pythagoras made these discoveries, and many of the accomplishments credited to him likely originated earlier or were made by his colleagues or successors. Some accounts mention that the philosophy associated with Pythagoras was related to mathematics and that numbers were important, but it is debated to what extent, if at all, he actually contributed to mathematics or natural philosophy./nPythagoras influenced Plato, whose dialogues, especially his Timaeus, exhibit Pythagorean teachings. Pythagorean ideas on mathematical perfection also impacted ancient Greek art. His teachings underwent a major revival in the first century BC among Middle Platonists, coinciding with the rise of Neopythagoreanism. Pythagoras continued to be regarded as a great philosopher throughout the Middle Ages and his philosophy had a major impact on scientists such as Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton. Pythagorean symbolism was used throughout early modern European esotericism, and his teachings as portrayed in Ovid's Metamorphoses influenced the modern vegetarian movement./nNo authentic writings of Pythagoras have survived,[6][7][8] and almost nothing is known for certain about his life.[9][10][11] The earliest sources on Pythagoras's life are brief, ambiguous, and often satirical.[8][12][13] The earliest source on Pythagoras's teachings is a satirical poem probably written after his death by Xenophanes of Colophon, who had been one of his contemporaries.[14][15] In the poem, Xenophanes describes Pythagoras interceding on behalf of a dog that is being beaten, professing to recognize in its cries the voice of a departed friend.[13][14][16][17] Alcmaeon of Croton, a doctor who lived in Croton at around the same time Pythagoras lived there,[14] incorporates many Pythagorean teachings into his writings[18] and alludes to having possibly known Pythagoras personally.[18] The poet Heraclitus of Ephesus, who was born across a few miles of sea away from Samos and may have lived within Pythagoras's lifetime,[19] mocked Pythagoras as a clever charlatan,[12][19] remarking that \"Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchus, practiced inquiry more than any other man, and selecting from these writings he manufactured a wisdom for himself\u2014much learning, artful knavery.\"[12][19]/nThe Greek poets Ion of Chios (c.\u2009480\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009421\u00a0BC) and Empedocles of Acragas (c.\u2009493\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009432\u00a0BC) both express admiration for Pythagoras in their poems.[20] The first concise description of Pythagoras comes from the historian Herodotus of Halicarnassus (c.\u2009484\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009420\u00a0BC),[21] who describes him as \"not the most insignificant\" of Greek sages[22] and states that Pythagoras taught his followers how to attain immortality.[21] The accuracy of the works of Herodotus is controversial.[23][24][25][26][27] The writings attributed to the Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus of Croton, who lived in the late fifth century BC, are the earliest texts to describe the numerological and musical theories that were later ascribed to Pythagoras.[28] The Athenian rhetorician Isocrates (436\u2013338 BC) was the first to describe Pythagoras as having visited Egypt.[21] Aristotle wrote a treatise On the Pythagoreans, which no longer exists.[29] Some of it may be preserved in the Protrepticus. Aristotle's disciples Dicaearchus, Aristoxenus, and Heraclides Ponticus also wrote on the same subject.[30]/nMost of the major sources on Pythagoras's life are from the Roman period,[31] by which point, according to the German classicist Walter Burkert, \"the history of Pythagoreanism was already... the laborious reconstruction of something lost and gone.\"[30] Three ancient biographies of Pythagoras have survived from late antiquity,[11][31] all of which are filled primarily with myths and legends.[11][31][32] The earliest and most respectable of these is the one from Diogenes La\u00ebrtius's Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers.[31][32] The two later biographies were written by the Neoplatonist philosophers Porphyry and Iamblichus[31][32] and were partially intended as polemics against the rise of Christianity.[32] The later sources are much lengthier than the earlier ones,[31] and even more fantastic in their descriptions of Pythagoras's achievements.[31][32] Porphyry and Iamblichus used material from the lost writings of Aristotle's disciples[30] and material taken from these sources is generally considered to be the most reliable.[30]/nThere is not a single detail in the life of Pythagoras that stands uncontradicted. But it is possible, from a more or less critical selection of the data, to construct a plausible account./nHerodotus,[34] Isocrates, and other early writers agree that Pythagoras was the son of Mnesarchus,[21][35] and that he was born on the Greek island of Samos in the eastern Aegean.[6][35][36][37] According to these biographers, Pythagoras' father was not born on the island, although he got naturalized there,[36] but according to Iamblichus he was a native of the island.[38] He is said to have been a gem-engraver or a wealthy merchant,[39][40][41] but his ancestry is disputed and unclear.[d] His mother was a native of Samos, descending from a geomoroi family.[44] Apollonius of Tyana, gives her name as Pytha\u00efs.[45][46] Iamblichus tells the story that the Pythia prophesied to her while she was pregnant with him that she would give birth to a man supremely beautiful, wise, and beneficial to humankind.[47] As to the date of his birth, Aristoxenus stated that Pythagoras left Samos in the reign of Polycrates, at the age of 40, which would give a date of birth around 570 BC.[48] Pythagoras's name led him to be associated with Pythian Apollo (P\u016bth\u00ed\u0101); Aristippus of Cyrene in the 4th century BC explained his name by saying, \"He spoke [\u1f00\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03c9, agore\u00fa\u014d] the truth no less than did the Pythian [\u03c0\u03c5\u03b8\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 puthik\u00f3s]\".[47]/nDuring Pythagoras's formative years, Samos was a thriving cultural hub known for its feats of advanced architectural engineering, including the building of the Tunnel of Eupalinos, and for its riotous festival culture.[49] It was a major center of trade in the Aegean where traders brought goods from the Near East.[6] According to Christiane L. Joost-Gaugier, these traders almost certainly brought with them Near Eastern ideas and traditions.[6] Pythagoras's early life also coincided with the flowering of early Ionian natural philosophy.[35][50] He was a contemporary of the philosophers Anaximander, Anaximenes, and the historian Hecataeus, all of whom lived in Miletus, across the sea from Samos.[50]/nPythagoras is traditionally thought to have received most of his education in the Near East.[51] Modern scholarship has shown that the culture of Archaic Greece was heavily influenced by those of Levantine and Mesopotamian cultures.[51] Like many other important Greek thinkers, Pythagoras was said to have studied in Egypt.[21][52][53] By the time of Isocrates in the fourth century BC, Pythagoras's reputed studies in Egypt were already taken as fact.[21][47] The writer Antiphon, who may have lived during the Hellenistic Era, claimed in his lost work On Men of Outstanding Merit, used as a source by Porphyry, that Pythagoras learned to speak Egyptian from the Pharaoh Amasis II himself, that he studied with the Egyptian priests at Diospolis (Thebes), and that he was the only foreigner ever to be granted the privilege of taking part in their worship.[51][54] The Middle Platonist biographer Plutarch (c.\u200946\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009120\u00a0AD) writes in his treatise On Isis and Osiris that, during his visit to Egypt, Pythagoras received instruction from the Egyptian priest Oenuphis of Heliopolis (meanwhile Solon received lectures from a Sonchis of Sais).[55] According to the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria (c.\u2009150\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009215\u00a0AD), \"Pythagoras was a disciple of Sonchis, an Egyptian archprophet, as well as Plato of Sechnuphis.\"[56] Some ancient writers claimed that Pythagoras learned geometry and the doctrine of metempsychosis from the Egyptians.[52][57]/nOther ancient writers, however, claimed that Pythagoras had learned these teachings from the Magi in Persia or even from Zoroaster himself.[58][59] Diogenes La\u00ebrtius asserts that Pythagoras later visited Crete, where he went to the Cave of Ida with Epimenides.[58] The Phoenicians are reputed to have taught Pythagoras arithmetic and the Chaldeans to have taught him astronomy.[59] By the third century BC, Pythagoras was already reported to have studied under the Jews as well.[59] Contradicting all these reports, the novelist Antonius Diogenes, writing in the second century BC, reports that Pythagoras discovered all his doctrines himself by interpreting dreams.[59] The third-century AD Sophist Philostratus claims that, in addition to the Egyptians, Pythagoras also studied under sages or gymnosophists in India.[59] Iamblichus expands this list even further by claiming that Pythagoras also studied with the Celts and Iberians.[59]/nAncient sources also record Pythagoras having studied under a variety of native Greek thinkers.[59] Some identify Hermodamas of Samos as a possible tutor.[59][61] Hermodamas represented the indigenous Samian rhapsodic tradition and his father Creophylos was said to have been the host of his rival poet Homer.[59] Others credit Bias of Priene, Thales,[62] or Anaximander (a pupil of Thales).[59][62][63] Other traditions claim the mythic bard Orpheus as Pythagoras's teacher, thus representing the Orphic Mysteries.[59] The Neoplatonists wrote of a \"sacred discourse\" Pythagoras had written on the gods in the Doric Greek dialect, which they believed had been dictated to Pythagoras by the Orphic priest Aglaophamus upon his initiation to the orphic Mysteries at Leibethra.[59] Iamblichus credited Orpheus with having been the model for Pythagoras's manner of speech, his spiritual attitude, and his manner of worship.[64] Iamblichus describes Pythagoreanism as a synthesis of everything Pythagoras had learned from Orpheus, from the Egyptian priests, from the Eleusinian Mysteries, and from other religious and philosophical traditions.[64] Riedweg states that, although these stories are fanciful, Pythagoras's teachings were definitely influenced by Orphism to a noteworthy extent.[65]/nOf the various Greek sages claimed to have taught Pythagoras, Pherecydes of Syros is mentioned most often.[65][66] Similar miracle stories were told about both Pythagoras and Pherecydes, including one in which the hero predicts a shipwreck, one in which he predicts the conquest of Messina, and one in which he drinks from a well and predicts an earthquake.[65] Apollonius Paradoxographus, a paradoxographer who may have lived in the second century BC, identified Pythagoras's thaumaturgic ideas as a result of Pherecydes's influence.[65] Another story, which may be traced to the Neopythagorean philosopher Nicomachus, tells that, when Pherecydes was old and dying on the island of Delos, Pythagoras returned to care for him and pay his respects.[65] Duris, the historian and tyrant of Samos, is reported to have patriotically boasted of an epitaph supposedly penned by Pherecydes which declared that Pythagoras's wisdom exceeded his own.[65] On the grounds of all these references connecting Pythagoras with Pherecydes, Riedweg concludes that there may well be some historical foundation to the tradition that Pherecydes was Pythagoras's teacher.[65] Pythagoras and Pherecydes also appear to have shared similar views on the soul and the teaching of metempsychosis.[65]/nBefore 520 BC, on one of his visits to Egypt or Greece, Pythagoras might have met Thales of Miletus, who would have been around fifty-four years older than him. Thales was a philosopher, scientist, mathematician, and engineer,[67] also known for a special case of the inscribed angle theorem. Pythagoras's birthplace, the island of Samos, is situated in the Northeast Aegean Sea not far from Miletus.[68] Diogenes La\u00ebrtius cites a statement from Aristoxenus (fourth century BC) stating that Pythagoras learned most of his moral doctrines from the Delphic priestess Themistoclea.[69][70][71] Porphyry agrees with this assertion,[72] but calls the priestess Aristoclea (Aristokleia).[73] Ancient authorities furthermore note the similarities between the religious and ascetic peculiarities of Pythagoras with the Orphic or Cretan mysteries,[74] or the Delphic oracle.[75]/nPorphyry repeats an account from Antiphon, who reported that, while he was still on Samos, Pythagoras founded a school known as the \"semicircle\".[76][77] Here, Samians debated matters of public concern.[76][77] Supposedly, the school became so renowned that the brightest minds in all of Greece came to Samos to hear Pythagoras teach.[76] Pythagoras himself dwelled in a secret cave, where he studied in private and occasionally held discourses with a few of his close friends.[76][77] Christoph Riedweg, a German scholar of early Pythagoreanism, states that it is entirely possible Pythagoras may have taught on Samos,[76] but cautions that Antiphon's account, which makes reference to a specific building that was still in use during his own time, appears to be motivated by Samian patriotic interest.[76]/nAround 530 BC, when Pythagoras was about forty years old, he left Samos.[6][35][78][79][80] His later admirers claimed that he left because he disagreed with the tyranny of Polycrates in Samos,[67][78] Riedweg notes that this explanation closely aligns with Nicomachus's emphasis on Pythagoras's purported love of freedom, but that Pythagoras's enemies portrayed him as having a proclivity towards tyranny.[78] Other accounts claim that Pythagoras left Samos because he was so overburdened with public duties in Samos, because of the high estimation in which he was held by his fellow-citizens.[81] He arrived in the Greek colony of Croton (today's Crotone, in Calabria) in what was then Magna Graecia.[35][80][82][83] All sources agree that Pythagoras was charismatic and quickly acquired great political influence in his new environment.[35][84][85] He served as an advisor to the elites in Croton and gave them frequent advice.[86] Later biographers tell fantastical stories of the effects of his eloquent speeches in leading the people of Croton to abandon their luxurious and corrupt way of life and devote themselves to the purer system which he came to introduce.[87][88]/nDiogenes La\u00ebrtius states that Pythagoras \"did not indulge in the pleasures of love\"[92] and that he cautioned others to only have sex \"whenever you are willing to be weaker than yourself\".[93] According to Porphyry, Pythagoras married Theano, a lady of Crete and the daughter of Pythenax[93] and had several children with her.[93] Porphyry writes that Pythagoras had two sons named Telauges and Arignote,[93] and a daughter named Myia,[93] who \"took precedence among the maidens in Croton and, when a wife, among married women.\"[93] Iamblichus mentions none of these children[93] and instead only mentions a son named Mnesarchus after his grandfather.[93] This son was raised by Pythagoras's appointed successor Aristaeus and eventually took over the school when Aristaeus was too old to continue running it.[93] Suda writes that Pythagoras had 4 children (Telauges, Mnesarchus, Myia and Arignote).[94]/nThe wrestler Milo of Croton was said to have been a close associate of Pythagoras[95] and was credited with having saved the philosopher's life when a roof was about to collapse.[95] This association may have been the result of confusion with a different man named Pythagoras, who was an athletics trainer.[76] Diogenes La\u00ebrtius records Milo's wife's name as Myia.[93] Iamblichus mentions Theano as the wife of Brontinus of Croton.[93] Diogenes La\u00ebrtius states that the same Theano was Pythagoras's pupil[93] and that Pythagoras's wife Theano was her daughter.[93] Diogenes La\u00ebrtius also records that works supposedly written by Theano were still extant during his own lifetime[93] and quotes several opinions attributed to her.[93] These writings are now known to be pseudepigraphical.[93]/nPythagoras's emphasis on dedication and asceticism are credited with aiding in Croton's decisive victory over the neighboring colony of Sybaris in 510 BC.[96] After the victory, some prominent citizens of Croton proposed a democratic constitution, which the Pythagoreans rejected.[96] The supporters of democracy, headed by Cylon and Ninon, the former of whom is said to have been irritated by his exclusion from Pythagoras's brotherhood, roused the populace against them.[97] Followers of Cylon and Ninon attacked the Pythagoreans during one of their meetings, either in the house of Milo or in some other meeting-place.[98][99] Accounts of the attack are often contradictory and many probably confused it with the later anti-Pythagorean rebellions, such as the one in Metapontum in 454 BC.[97][100] The building was apparently set on fire,[98] and many of the assembled members perished;[98] only the younger and more active members managed to escape.[101]/nSources disagree regarding whether Pythagoras was present when the attack occurred and, if he was, whether or not he managed to escape.[33][99] In some accounts, Pythagoras was not at the meeting when the Pythagoreans were attacked because he was on Delos tending to the dying Pherecydes.[99] According to another account from Dicaearchus, Pythagoras was at the meeting and managed to escape,[102] leading a small group of followers to the nearby city of Locris, where they pleaded for sanctuary, but were denied.[102] They reached the city of Metapontum, where they took shelter in the temple of the Muses and died there of starvation after forty days without food.[33][98][102][103] Another tale recorded by Porphyry claims that, as Pythagoras's enemies were burning the house, his devoted students laid down on the ground to make a path for him to escape by walking over their bodies across the flames like a bridge.[102] Pythagoras managed to escape, but was so despondent at the deaths of his beloved students that he committed suicide.[102] A different legend reported by both Diogenes La\u00ebrtius and Iamblichus states that Pythagoras almost managed to escape, but that he came to a fava bean field and refused to run through it, since doing so would violate his teachings, so he stopped instead and was killed.[102][104] This story seems to have originated from the writer Neanthes, who told it about later Pythagoreans, not about Pythagoras himself.[102]/nAlthough the exact details of Pythagoras's teachings are uncertain,[106][107] it is possible to reconstruct a general outline of his main ideas.[106][108] Aristotle writes at length about the teachings of the Pythagoreans,[17][109] but without mentioning Pythagoras directly.[17][109] One of Pythagoras's main doctrines appears to have been metempsychosis,[79][110][111][112][113][114] the belief that all souls are immortal and that, after death, a soul is transferred into a new body.[110][113] This teaching is referenced by Xenophanes, Ion of Chios, and Herodotus.[110][115] Nothing whatsoever, however, is known about the nature or mechanism by which Pythagoras believed metempsychosis to occur.[116]/nEmpedocles alludes in one of his poems that Pythagoras may have claimed to possess the ability to recall his former incarnations.[117] Diogenes La\u00ebrtius reports an account from Heraclides Ponticus that Pythagoras told people that he had lived four previous lives that he could remember in detail.[118][119][120] The first of these lives was as Aethalides the son of Hermes, who granted him the ability to remember all his past incarnations.[121] Next, he was incarnated as Euphorbus, a minor hero from the Trojan War briefly mentioned in the Iliad.[122] He then became the philosopher Hermotimus,[123] who recognized the shield of Euphorbus in the temple of Apollo.[123] His final incarnation was as Pyrrhus, a fisherman from Delos.[123] One of his past lives, as reported by Dicaearchus, was as a beautiful courtesan.[111][124]/nAnother belief attributed to Pythagoras was that of the \"harmony of the spheres\",[125][126] which maintained that the planets and stars move according to mathematical equations, which correspond to musical notes and thus produce an inaudible symphony.[125][126] According to Porphyry, Pythagoras taught that the seven Muses were actually the seven planets singing together.[127] In his philosophical dialogue Protrepticus, Aristotle has his literary double say:/nWhen Pythagoras was asked [why humans exist], he said, \"to observe the heavens,\" and he used to claim that he himself was an observer of nature, and it was for the sake of this that he had passed over into life.[128]/nPythagoras was said to have practiced divination and prophecy.[129] In the visits to various places in Greece\u2014Delos, Sparta, Phlius, Crete, etc.\u2014which are ascribed to him, he usually appears either in his religious or priestly guise, or else as a lawgiver.[130]/nPythagoras and his followers reportedly had a spiritual practice known as \"smoke trapping\". This involved entering an enclosed space, typically a cave, and lighting a fire until noxious fumes filled the room. They would inhale the smoke and would experience vivid hallucinations due to oxygen deprivation and hypercapnia. They supposedly would see divine geometric shapes and patterns which they would copy onto the walls with charcoal to be analyzed at a later point.[131]/nThe so-called Pythagoreans, who were the first to take up mathematics, not only advanced this subject, but saturated with it, they fancied that the principles of mathematics were the principles of all things./nAccording to Aristotle, the Pythagoreans used mathematics for solely mystical reasons, devoid of practical application.[136] They believed that all things were made of numbers.[137][138] The number one (the monad) represented the origin of all things[139] and the number two (the dyad) represented matter.[139] The number three was an \"ideal number\" because it had a beginning, middle, and end[140] and was the smallest number of points that could be used to define a plane triangle, which they revered as a symbol of the god Apollo.[140] The number four signified the four seasons and the four elements.[141] The number seven was also sacred because it was the number of planets and the number of strings on a lyre,[141] and because Apollo's birthday was celebrated on the seventh day of each month.[141] They believed that odd numbers were masculine,[142] that even numbers were feminine,[142] and that the number five represented marriage, because it was the sum of two and three.[143][144]/nTen was regarded as the \"perfect number\"[136] and the Pythagoreans honored it by never gathering in groups larger than ten.[145] Pythagoras was credited with devising the tetractys, the triangular figure of four rows which add up to the perfect number, ten.[132][133] The Pythagoreans regarded the tetractys as a symbol of utmost mystical importance.[132][133][134] Iamblichus, in his Life of Pythagoras, states that the tetractys was \"so admirable, and so divinised by those who understood [it],\" that Pythagoras's students would swear oaths by it.[105][133][134][146] Andrew Gregory concludes that the tradition linking Pythagoras to the tetractys is probably genuine.[147]/nModern scholars debate whether these numerological teachings were developed by Pythagoras himself or by the later Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus of Croton.[148] In his landmark study Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism, Walter Burkert argues that Pythagoras was a charismatic political and religious teacher,[149] but that the number philosophy attributed to him was really an innovation by Philolaus.[150] According to Burkert, Pythagoras never dealt with numbers at all, let alone made any noteworthy contribution to mathematics.[149] Burkert argues that the only mathematics the Pythagoreans ever actually engaged in was simple, proofless arithmetic,[151] but that these arithmetic discoveries did contribute significantly to the beginnings of mathematics.[152]/nBoth Plato and Isocrates state that, above all else, Pythagoras was known as the founder of a new way of life.[153][154][155] The organization Pythagoras founded at Croton was called a \"school\",[156][157][67] but, in many ways, resembled a monastery.[158] The adherents were bound by a vow to Pythagoras and each other, for the purpose of pursuing the religious and ascetic observances, and of studying his religious and philosophical theories.[159] The members of the sect shared all their possessions in common[160] and were devoted to each other to the exclusion of outsiders.[161][162] Ancient sources record that the Pythagoreans ate meals in common after the manner of the Spartans.[163][164] One Pythagorean maxim was \"koin\u00e0 t\u00e0 ph\u00edl\u014dn\" (\"All things in common among friends\").[160] Both Iamblichus and Porphyry provide detailed accounts of the organization of the school, although the primary interest of both writers is not historical accuracy, but rather to present Pythagoras as a divine figure, sent by the gods to benefit humankind.[165] Iamblichus, in particular, presents the \"Pythagorean Way of Life\" as a pagan alternative to the Christian monastic communities of his own time.[158]/nTwo groups existed within early Pythagoreanism: the mathematikoi (\"learners\") and the akousmatikoi (\"listeners\").[68][166] The akousmatikoi are traditionally identified by scholars as \"old believers\" in mysticism, numerology, and religious teachings;[166] whereas the mathematikoi are traditionally identified as a more intellectual, modernist faction who were more rationalist and scientific.[166] Gregory cautions that there was probably not a sharp distinction between them and that many Pythagoreans probably believed the two approaches were compatible.[166] The study of mathematics and music may have been connected to the worship of Apollo.[167] The Pythagoreans believed that music was a purification for the soul, just as medicine was a purification for the body.[127] One anecdote of Pythagoras reports that when he encountered some drunken youths trying to break into the home of a virtuous woman, he sang a solemn tune with long spondees and the boys' \"raging willfulness\" was quelled.[127] The Pythagoreans also placed particular emphasis on the importance of physical exercise;[158] therapeutic dancing, daily morning walks along scenic routes, and athletics were major components of the Pythagorean lifestyle.[158] Moments of contemplation at the beginning and end of each day were also advised.[168]/nPythagorean teachings were known as \"symbols\" (symbola)[89] and members took a vow of silence that they would not reveal these symbols to non-members.[89][154][169] Those who did not obey the laws of the community were expelled[170] and the remaining members would erect tombstones for them as though they had died.[170] A number of \"oral sayings\" (ako\u00fasmata) attributed to Pythagoras have survived,[17][171] dealing with how members of the Pythagorean community should perform sacrifices, how they should honor the gods, how they should \"move from here\", and how they should be buried.[172] Many of these sayings emphasize the importance of ritual purity and avoiding defilement.[173][114] For instance, a saying which Leonid Zhmud concludes can probably be genuinely traced back to Pythagoras himself forbids his followers from wearing woolen garments.[174] Other extant oral sayings forbid Pythagoreans from breaking bread, poking fires with swords, or picking up crumbs[164] and teach that a person should always put the right sandal on before the left.[164] The exact meanings of these sayings, however, are frequently obscure.[175] Iamblichus preserves Aristotle's descriptions of the original, ritualistic intentions behind a few of these sayings,[176] but these apparently later fell out of fashion, because Porphyry provides markedly different ethical-philosophical interpretations of them:[177]/nNew initiates were allegedly not permitted to meet Pythagoras until after they had completed a five-year initiation period,[77] during which they were required to remain silent.[77] Sources indicate that Pythagoras himself was unusually progressive in his attitudes towards women[91] and female members of Pythagoras's school appear to have played an active role in its operations.[89][91] Iamblichus provides a list of 235 famous Pythagoreans,[90] seventeen of whom are women.[90] In later times, many prominent female philosophers contributed to the development of Neopythagoreanism.[179]/nPythagoreanism also entailed a number of dietary prohibitions.[114][164][180] It is more or less agreed that Pythagoras issued a prohibition against the consumption of fava beans[181][164] and the meat of non-sacrificial animals such as fish and poultry.[174][164] Both of these assumptions, however, have been contradicted.[182][183] Pythagorean dietary restrictions may have been motivated by belief in the doctrine of metempsychosis.[154][184][185][186] Some ancient writers present Pythagoras as enforcing a strictly vegetarian diet.[e][154][185] Eudoxus of Cnidus, a student of Archytas, writes, \"Pythagoras was distinguished by such purity and so avoided killing and killers that he not only abstained from animal foods, but even kept his distance from cooks and hunters.\"[187][188] Other authorities contradict this statement.[189] According to Aristoxenus,[190] Pythagoras allowed the use of all kinds of animal food except the flesh of oxen used for ploughing, and rams.[188][191] According to Heraclides Ponticus, Pythagoras ate the meat from sacrifices[188] and established a diet for athletes dependent on meat.[188]/nWithin his own lifetime, Pythagoras was already the subject of elaborate hagiographic legends.[31][192] Aristotle described Pythagoras as a wonder-worker and somewhat of a supernatural figure.[193][194] In a fragment, Aristotle writes that Pythagoras had a golden thigh,[193][195][196] which he publicly exhibited at the Olympic Games[193][197] and showed to Abaris the Hyperborean as proof of his identity as the \"Hyperborean Apollo\".[193][198] Supposedly, the priest of Apollo gave Pythagoras a magic arrow, which he used to fly over long distances and perform ritual purifications.[199] He was supposedly once seen at both Metapontum and Croton at the same time.[200][31][197][195][196] When Pythagoras crossed the river Kosas (the modern-day Basento), \"several witnesses\" reported that they heard it greet him by name.[201][197][195] In Roman times, a legend claimed that Pythagoras was the son of Apollo.[202][196] According to Muslim tradition, Pythagoras was said to have been initiated by Hermes (Egyptian Thoth).[203]/nPythagoras was said to have dressed all in white.[193][204] He is also said to have borne a golden wreath atop his head[193] and to have worn trousers after the fashion of the Thracians.[193] Diogenes La\u00ebrtius presents Pythagoras as having exercised remarkable self-control;[205] he was always cheerful,[205] but \"abstained wholly from laughter, and from all such indulgences as jests and idle stories\".[93] Pythagoras was said to have had extraordinary success in dealing with animals.[31][206][197] A fragment from Aristotle records that, when a deadly snake bit Pythagoras, he bit it back and killed it.[199][197][195] Both Porphyry and Iamblichus report that Pythagoras once persuaded a bull not to eat fava beans[31][206] and that he once convinced a notoriously destructive bear to swear that it would never harm a living thing again, and that the bear kept its word.[31][206]/nRiedweg suggests that Pythagoras may have personally encouraged these legends,[192] but Gregory states that there is no direct evidence of this.[166] Anti-Pythagorean legends were also circulated.[207] Diogenes La\u00ebrtes retells a story told by Hermippus of Samos, which states that Pythagoras had once gone into an underground room, telling everyone that he was descending to the underworld.[208] He stayed in this room for months, while his mother secretly recorded everything that happened during his absence.[208] After he returned from this room, Pythagoras recounted everything that had happened while he was gone,[208] convincing everyone that he had really been in the underworld[208] and leading them to trust him with their wives.[208]/nAlthough Pythagoras is most famous today for his alleged mathematical discoveries,[135][209] classical historians dispute whether he himself ever actually made any significant contributions to the field.[151][149] Many mathematical and scientific discoveries were attributed to Pythagoras, including his famous theorem,[210] as well as discoveries in the fields of music,[211] astronomy,[212] and medicine.[213] Since at least the first century BC, Pythagoras has commonly been given credit for discovering the Pythagorean theorem,[214][215] a theorem in geometry that states that \"in a right-angled triangle the square of the hypotenuse is equal [to the sum of] the squares of the two other sides\"[216]\u2014that is, \n\n\n\n\na\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\nb\n\n2\n\n\n=\n\nc\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}\n\n. According to a popular legend, after he discovered this theorem, Pythagoras sacrificed an ox, or possibly even a whole hecatomb, to the gods.[216][217] Cicero rejected this story as spurious[216] because of the much more widely held belief that Pythagoras forbade blood sacrifices.[216] Porphyry attempted to explain the story by asserting that the ox was actually made of dough.[216]/nThe Pythagorean theorem was known and used by the Babylonians and Indians centuries before Pythagoras,[218][216][219][220] but he may have been the first to introduce it to the Greeks.[221][219] Some historians of mathematics have even suggested that he\u2014or his students\u2014may have constructed the first proof.[222] Burkert rejects this suggestion as implausible,[221] noting that Pythagoras was never credited with having proved any theorem in antiquity.[221] Furthermore, the manner in which the Babylonians employed Pythagorean numbers implies that they knew that the principle was generally applicable, and knew some kind of proof, which has not yet been found in the (still largely unpublished) cuneiform sources.[f] Pythagoras's biographers state that he also was the first to identify the five regular solids[135] and that he was the first to discover the Theory of Proportions.[135]/nAccording to legend, Pythagoras discovered that musical notes could be translated into mathematical equations when he passed blacksmiths at work one day and heard the sound of their hammers clanging against the anvils.[223][224] Thinking that the sounds of the hammers were beautiful and harmonious, except for one,[225] he rushed into the blacksmith shop and began testing the hammers.[225] He then realized that the tune played when the hammer struck was directly proportional to the size of the hammer and therefore concluded that music was mathematical.[224][225]/nIn ancient times, Pythagoras and his contemporary Parmenides of Elea were both credited with having been the first to teach that the Earth was spherical,[226] the first to divide the globe into five climatic zones,[226] and the first to identify the morning star and the evening star as the same celestial object (now known as Venus).[227] Of the two philosophers, Parmenides has a much stronger claim to having been the first[228] and the attribution of these discoveries to Pythagoras seems to have possibly originated from a pseudepigraphal poem.[227] Empedocles, who lived in Magna Graecia shortly after Pythagoras and Parmenides, knew that the earth was spherical.[229] By the end of the fifth century BC, this fact was universally accepted among Greek intellectuals.[230] The identity of the morning star and evening star was known to the Babylonians over a thousand years earlier.[231]/nSizeable Pythagorean communities existed in Magna Graecia, Phlius, and Thebes during the early fourth century BC.[233] Around the same time, the Pythagorean philosopher Archytas was highly influential on the politics of the city of Tarentum in Magna Graecia.[234] According to later tradition, Archytas was elected as strategos (\"general\") seven times, even though others were prohibited from serving more than a year.[234] Archytas was also a renowned mathematician and musician.[235] He was a close friend of Plato[236] and he is quoted in Plato's Republic.[237][238] Aristotle states that the philosophy of Plato was heavily dependent on the teachings of the Pythagoreans.[239][240] Cicero repeats this statement, remarking that Platonem ferunt didicisse Pythagorea omnia (\"They say Plato learned all things Pythagorean\").[241] According to Charles H. Kahn, Plato's middle dialogues, including Meno, Phaedo, and The Republic, have a strong \"Pythagorean coloring\",[242] and his last few dialogues (particularly Philebus and Timaeus)[232] are extremely Pythagorean in character.[232]/nAccording to R. M. Hare, Plato's Republic may be partially based on the \"tightly organised community of like-minded thinkers\" established by Pythagoras at Croton.[243] Additionally, Plato may have borrowed from Pythagoras the idea that mathematics and abstract thought are a secure basis for philosophy, science, and morality.[243] Plato and Pythagoras shared a \"mystical approach to the soul and its place in the material world\"[243] and both were probably influenced by Orphism.[243] The historian of philosophy Frederick Copleston states that Plato probably borrowed his tripartite theory of the soul from the Pythagoreans.[244] Bertrand Russell, in his A History of Western Philosophy, contends that the influence of Pythagoras on Plato and others was so great that he should be considered the most influential philosopher of all time.[245] He concludes that \"I do not know of any other man who has been as influential as he was in the school of thought.\"[246]/nA revival of Pythagorean teachings occurred in the first century BC[247] when Middle Platonist philosophers such as Eudorus and Philo of Alexandria hailed the rise of a \"new\" Pythagoreanism in Alexandria.[248] At around the same time, Neopythagoreanism became prominent.[249] The first-century AD philosopher Apollonius of Tyana sought to emulate Pythagoras and live by Pythagorean teachings.[250] The later first-century Neopythagorean philosopher Moderatus of Gades expanded on Pythagorean number philosophy[250] and probably understood the soul as a \"kind of mathematical harmony.\"[250] The Neopythagorean mathematician and musicologist Nicomachus likewise expanded on Pythagorean numerology and music theory.[249] Numenius of Apamea interpreted Plato's teachings in light of Pythagorean doctrines.[251]/nGreek sculpture sought to represent the permanent reality behind superficial appearances.[253] Early Archaic sculpture represents life in simple forms, and may have been influenced by the earliest Greek natural philosophies.[g] The Greeks generally believed that nature expressed itself in ideal forms and was represented by a type (\u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2), which was mathematically calculated.[254][255] When dimensions changed, architects sought to relay permanence through mathematics.[256][257] Maurice Bowra believes that these ideas influenced the theory of Pythagoras and his students, who believed that \"all things are numbers\".[257]/nDuring the sixth century BC, the number philosophy of the Pythagoreans triggered a revolution in Greek sculpture.[258] Greek sculptors and architects attempted to find the mathematical relation (canon) behind aesthetic perfection.[255] Possibly drawing on the ideas of Pythagoras,[255] the sculptor Polykleitos wrote in his Canon that beauty consists in the proportion, not of the elements (materials), but of the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole.[255][h] In the Greek architectural orders, every element was calculated and constructed by mathematical relations. Rhys Carpenter states that the ratio 2:1 was \"the generative ratio of the Doric order, and in Hellenistic times an ordinary Doric colonnade, beats out a rhythm of notes.\"[255]/nThe oldest known building designed according to Pythagorean teachings is the Porta Maggiore Basilica,[259] a subterranean basilica which was built during the reign of the Roman emperor Nero as a secret place of worship for Pythagoreans.[260] The basilica was built underground because of the Pythagorean emphasis on secrecy[261] and also because of the legend that Pythagoras had sequestered himself in a cave on Samos.[262] The basilica's apse is in the east and its atrium in the west out of respect for the rising sun.[263] It has a narrow entrance leading to a small pool where the initiates could purify themselves.[264] The building is also designed according to Pythagorean numerology,[265] with each table in the sanctuary providing seats for seven people.[145] Three aisles lead to a single altar, symbolizing the three parts of the soul approaching the unity of Apollo.[145] The apse depicts a scene of the poet Sappho leaping off the Leucadian cliffs, clutching her lyre to her breast, while Apollo stands beneath her, extending his right hand in a gesture of protection,[266] symbolizing Pythagorean teachings about the immortality of the soul.[266] The interior of the sanctuary is almost entirely white because the color white was regarded by Pythagoreans as sacred.[267]/nThe emperor Hadrian's Pantheon in Rome was also built based on Pythagorean numerology.[252] The temple's circular plan, central axis, hemispherical dome, and alignment with the four cardinal directions symbolize Pythagorean views on the order of the universe.[268] The single oculus at the top of the dome symbolizes the monad and the sun-god Apollo.[269] The twenty-eight ribs extending from the oculus symbolize the moon, because twenty-eight was the same number of months on the Pythagorean lunar calendar.[270] The five coffered rings beneath the ribs represent the marriage of the sun and moon.[140]/nMany early Christians had a deep respect for Pythagoras.[271] Eusebius (c. 260 \u2013 c. 340 AD), bishop of Caesarea, praises Pythagoras in his Against Hierokles for his rule of silence, his frugality, his \"extraordinary\" morality, and his wise teachings.[272] In another work, Eusebius compares Pythagoras to Moses.[272] In one of his letters, the Church Father Jerome (c. 347 \u2013 420 AD) praises Pythagoras for his wisdom[272] and, in another letter, he credits Pythagoras for his belief in the immortality of the soul, which he suggests Christians inherited from him.[273] Augustine of Hippo (354 \u2013 430 AD) rejected Pythagoras's teaching of metempsychosis without explicitly naming him, but otherwise expressed admiration for him.[274] In On the Trinity, Augustine lauds the fact that Pythagoras was humble enough to call himself a philosophos or \"lover of wisdom\" rather than a \"sage\".[275] In another passage, Augustine defends Pythagoras's reputation, arguing that Pythagoras certainly never taught the doctrine of metempsychosis.[275]/nDuring the Middle Ages, Pythagoras was revered as the founder of mathematics and music, two of the Seven Liberal Arts.[276] He appears in numerous medieval depictions, in illuminated manuscripts and in the relief sculptures on the portal of the Cathedral of Chartres.[276] The Timaeus was the only dialogue of Plato to survive in Latin translation in western Europe,[276] which led William of Conches (c. 1080\u20131160) to declare that Plato was Pythagorean.[276] In the 1430s, the Camaldolese friar Ambrose Traversari translated Diogenes La\u00ebrtius's Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers from Greek into Latin[276] and, in the 1460s, the philosopher Marsilio Ficino translated Porphyry and Iamblichus's Lives of Pythagoras into Latin as well,[276] thereby allowing them to be read and studied by western scholars.[276] In 1494, the Greek Neopythagorean scholar Constantine Lascaris published The Golden Verses of Pythagoras, translated into Latin, with a printed edition of his Grammatica,[277] thereby bringing them to a widespread audience.[277] In 1499, he published the first Renaissance biography of Pythagoras in his work Vitae illustrium philosophorum siculorum et calabrorum, issued in Messina.[277]/nIn his preface to his book On the Revolution of the Heavenly Spheres (1543), Nicolaus Copernicus cites various Pythagoreans as the most important influences on the development of his heliocentric model of the universe,[276][278] deliberately omitting mention of Aristarchus of Samos, a non-Pythagorean astronomer who had developed a fully heliocentric model in the fourth century BC, in effort to portray his model as fundamentally Pythagorean.[278] Johannes Kepler considered himself to be a Pythagorean.[276][279][280] He believed in the Pythagorean doctrine of musica universalis[281] and it was his search for the mathematical equations behind this doctrine that led to his discovery of the laws of planetary motion.[281] Kepler titled his book on the subject Harmonices Mundi (Harmonics of the World), after the Pythagorean teaching that had inspired him.[276][282] Near the conclusion of the book, Kepler describes himself falling asleep to the sound of the heavenly music, \"warmed by having drunk a generous draught... from the cup of Pythagoras.\"[283] He also called Pythagoras the \"grandfather\" of all Copernicans.[284]/nIsaac Newton firmly believed in the Pythagorean teaching of the mathematical harmony and order of the universe.[285] Though Newton was notorious for rarely giving others credit for their discoveries,[286] he attributed the discovery of the Law of Universal Gravitation to Pythagoras.[286] Albert Einstein believed that a scientist may also be \"a Platonist or a Pythagorean insofar as he considers the viewpoint of logical simplicity as an indispensable and effective tool of his research.\"[287] The English philosopher Alfred North Whitehead argued that \"In a sense, Plato and Pythagoras stand nearer to modern physical science than does Aristotle. The two former were mathematicians, whereas Aristotle was the son of a doctor\".[288] By this measure, Whitehead declared that Einstein and other modern scientists like him are \"following the pure Pythagorean tradition.\"[287][289]/nA fictionalized portrayal of Pythagoras appears in Book XV of Ovid's Metamorphoses,[291] in which he delivers a speech imploring his followers to adhere to a strictly vegetarian diet.[292] It was through Arthur Golding's 1567 English translation of Ovid's Metamorphoses that Pythagoras was best known to English-speakers throughout the early modern period.[292] John Donne's Progress of the Soul discusses the implications of the doctrines expounded in the speech,[293] and Michel de Montaigne quoted the speech no less than three times in his treatise \"Of Cruelty\" to voice his moral objections against the mistreatment of animals.[293] William Shakespeare references the speech in his play The Merchant of Venice.[294] John Dryden included a translation of the scene with Pythagoras in his 1700 work Fables, Ancient and Modern,[293] and John Gay's 1726 fable \"Pythagoras and the Countryman\" reiterates its major themes, linking carnivorism with tyranny.[293] Lord Chesterfield records that his conversion to vegetarianism had been motivated by reading Pythagoras's speech in Ovid's Metamorphoses.[293] Until the word vegetarianism was coined in the 1840s, vegetarians were referred to in English as \"Pythagoreans\".[293] Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote an ode entitled \"To the Pythagorean Diet\",[295] and Leo Tolstoy adopted the Pythagorean diet himself.[295]/nEarly modern European esotericism drew heavily on the teachings of Pythagoras.[276] The German humanist scholar Johannes Reuchlin (1455\u20131522) synthesized Pythagoreanism with Christian theology and Jewish Kabbalah,[296] arguing that Kabbalah and Pythagoreanism were both inspired by Mosaic tradition[297] and that Pythagoras was therefore a kabbalist.[297] In his dialogue De verbo mirifico (1494), Reuchlin compared the Pythagorean tetractys to the ineffable divine name YHWH,[296] ascribing each of the four letters of the tetragrammaton a symbolic meaning according to Pythagorean mystical teachings.[297]/nHeinrich Cornelius Agrippa's popular and influential three-volume treatise De Occulta Philosophia cites Pythagoras as a \"religious magi\"[298] and advances the idea that Pythagoras's mystical numerology operates on a supercelestial level,[298] a religious term used to describe a high heavenly realm used during his time. The freemasons deliberately modeled their society on the community founded by Pythagoras at Croton.[299] Rosicrucianism used Pythagorean symbolism,[276] as did Robert Fludd (1574\u20131637),[276] who believed his own musical writings to have been inspired by Pythagoras.[276] John Dee was heavily influenced by Pythagorean ideology,[300][298] particularly the teaching that all things are made of numbers.[300][298] Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the Illuminati, was a strong admirer of Pythagoras[301] and, in his book Pythagoras (1787), he advocated that society should be reformed to be more like Pythagoras's commune at Croton.[302] Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart incorporated Masonic and Pythagorean symbolism into his opera The Magic Flute.[303] Sylvain Mar\u00e9chal, in his six-volume 1799 biography The Voyages of Pythagoras, declared that all revolutionaries in all time periods are the \"heirs of Pythagoras\".[304]/nDante Alighieri was fascinated by Pythagorean numerology[305] and based his descriptions of Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven on Pythagorean numbers.[305] Dante wrote that Pythagoras saw Unity as Good and Plurality as Evil[306] and, in Paradiso XV, 56\u201357, he declares: \"five and six, if understood, ray forth from unity.\"[307] The number eleven and its multiples are found throughout the Divine Comedy, each book of which has thirty-three cantos, except for the Inferno, which has thirty-four, the first of which serves as a general introduction.[308] Dante describes the ninth and tenth bolgias in the Eighth Circle of Hell as being twenty-two miles and eleven miles respectively,[308] which correspond to the fraction 22/7, which was the Pythagorean approximation of pi.[308]/nThe Transcendentalists read the ancient Lives of Pythagoras as guides on how to live a model life.[309] Henry David Thoreau was impacted by Thomas Taylor's translations of Iamblichus's Life of Pythagoras and Stobaeus's Pythagoric Sayings[309] and his views on nature may have been influenced by the Pythagorean idea of images corresponding to archetypes.[309] The Pythagorean teaching of musica universalis is a recurring theme throughout Thoreau's magnum opus, Walden.[309]", "40458988": "Ashot Vezirovich Petrosian (Armenian: \u0531\u0577\u0578\u057f \u054e\u0565\u0566\u056b\u0580\u056b \u054a\u0565\u057f\u0580\u0578\u057d\u0575\u0561\u0576; June 2, 1930 \u2013 February 23, 1998) was a Soviet Armenian mathematician.

The paper in question had been accepted for publication by a scientific peer-reviewed journal in 1994.[8][9][10] Their rebuttal, together with a paper written by an anonymous mathematician, argued that the patterns in the Bible that supposedly indicate some hidden message from a divine source or have predictive power can be just as easily found in other works, such as War and Peace.[11] The discredited theory was taken up by US journalist Michael Drosnin. [12][13] Drosnin said he was convinced of this theory when one of its exponents stated that the Torah predicted the Iraqi wars. He expressed his certainty publicly that such coded messages could not be found in any other work than the Bible, and, in an interview with Newsweek, he challenged:\n\"When my critics find a message about the assassination of a prime minister encrypted in Moby Dick, I'll believe them.\"[12]/nUsing the Bible decryption method espoused by the group led by Eliyahu Rips, McKay quickly found some nine references to Yitzhak Rabin's assassination in Herman Melville's masterpiece. He also showed that the same technique allowed him to find ostensible mentions of Diana, Princess of Wales, her lover Dodi Fayed, and their chauffeur Henri Paul in the same novel.[14]/nThis debunking disproof of a theory that the bible encrypts secret messages containing future world history achieved international fame for McKay outside of his specific field of combinatorics.[15][16][17]/nMcKay was involved in the uncovering of the original source of the Azzam Pasha quotation. The original source, an 11 October 1947 article in the Egyptian newspaper Akhbar al-Yom, was first referenced in an article by David Barnett and Efraim Karsh in the Fall 2011 issue of Middle East Quarterly without reference to McKay.[18] Tom Segev responded in an op-ed in Haaretz that McKay had in fact been the original source of the material and had uploaded it to Wikipedia.[19] McKay had notified the Wikipedia talk page of having found the original interview from which the quote was taken and later provided it to Barnett.

From 1814 he studied in Gymnasium in Ausbach.  He attended the University of G\u00f6ttingen from 1818 to 1822 where he studied with Gauss who was director of the observatory. Staudt provided an ephemeris for the orbits of Mars and the asteroid Pallas. When in 1821 Comet Nicollet-Pons was observed, he provided the elements of its orbit. These accomplishments in astronomy earned him his doctorate from University of Erlangen in 1822./nStaudt's professional career began as a secondary school instructor in W\u00fcrzburg until 1827 and then Nuremberg until 1835. He married Jeanette Dreschler in 1832. They had a son Eduard and daughter Mathilda, but Jeanette died in 1848./nThe book Geometrie der Lage (1847) was a landmark in projective geometry. As Burau (1976) wrote:/nFurthermore, this book (page 43) uses the complete quadrangle to \"construct the fourth harmonic associated with three points on a straight line\", the projective harmonic conjugate./nIndeed, in 1889 Mario Pieri translated von Staudt, before writing his I Principii della Geometrie di Posizione Composti in un Systema Logico-deduttivo (1898). In 1900 Charlotte Scott of Bryn Mawr College paraphrased much of von Staudt's work in English for The Mathematical Gazette.[2] When Wilhelm Blaschke published his textbook Projective Geometry in 1948, a portrait of the young Karl was placed opposite the Vorwort./nStaudt went beyond real projective geometry and into complex projective space in his three volumes of Beitr\u00e4ge zur Geometrie der Lage published from 1856 to 1860./nIn 1922 H. F. Baker wrote of von Staudt's work:/nVon Staudt is also remembered for his view of conic sections and the relation of pole and polar:/nIn 1857, in the second Beitr\u00e4ge, von Staudt contributed a route to number through geometry called the algebra of throws (German: Wurftheorie). It is based on projective range and the relation of projective harmonic conjugates. Through operations of addition of points and multiplication of points, one obtains an \"algebra of points\", as in chapter 6 of Veblen & Young's textbook on projective geometry. The usual presentation relies on cross ratio (CA,BD) of four collinear points. For instance, Coolidge wrote:[5]/nA summary statement is given by Veblen & Young[6] as Theorem 10: \"The set of points on a line, with \n\n\n\n\nP\n\n\u221e\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P_{\\infty }}\n\n removed, forms a field with respect to the operations previously defined\".

One of the required properties is that a bounded sequence has a cluster point. As Hans Freudenthal observed:/nOne of the Italian mathematicians was Giovanni Vailati who studied the circular order property of the real projective line. The science of this order requires a quaternary relation called the separation relation. Using this relation, the concepts of monotone sequence and limit can be addressed, in a cyclic \"line\". Assuming that every monotone sequence has a limit,[10] the line becomes a complete space.

He then studied mathematics at the University of Breslau and was awarded a doctorate in algebraic geometry in 1905. In 1906 Toeplitz arrived at G\u00f6ttingen University, which was then the world's leading mathematical center, and he remained there for seven years. The mathematics faculty included David Hilbert, Felix Klein, and Hermann Minkowski. Toeplitz joined a group of young people working with Hilbert: Max Born, Richard Courant and Ernst Hellinger, with whom he collaborated for many years afterward. At that time Toeplitz began to rework the theory of linear functionals and quadratic forms on n-dimensional spaces for infinite dimensional spaces. He wrote five papers directly related to spectral theory of operators which Hilbert was developing. During this period he also published a paper on summation processes and discovered the basic ideas of what are now called the Toeplitz operators. In 1913 Toeplitz became an extraordinary professor at the University of Kiel. He was promoted to a professor in 1920./nIn 1911, Toeplitz proposed the inscribed square problem:/nThis has been established for convex curves and smooth curves, but the question remains open in general (2007)./nTogether with Hans Rademacher, he wrote a classic of popular mathematics Von Zahlen und Figuren, which was first published in 1930 and later translated into English as Enjoyment of Mathematics./nToeplitz was deeply interested in the history of mathematics. In 1929, he cofounded \"Quellen und Studien zur Geschichte der Mathematik\" with Otto Neugebauer and Julius Stenzel. Beginning in the 1920s, Toeplitz advocated a \"genetic method\" in teaching of mathematics, which he applied in writing the book Entwicklung der Infinitesimalrechnung (\"The Calculus: A Genetic Approach\"). The book introduces the subject by giving an idealized historical narrative to motivate the concepts, showing how they developed from classical problems of Greek mathematics. It was left unfinished, edited by Gottfried K\u00f6the and posthumously published in German in 1946 (English translation: 1963)./nIn 1928 Toeplitz succeeded Eduard Study at Bonn University. In 1933, the Civil Service Law came into effect and professors of Jewish origin were removed from teaching. Initially, Toeplitz was able to retain his position due to an exception for those who had been appointed before 1914, but he was nonetheless dismissed in 1935. In 1939 he emigrated to Mandatory Palestine, where he was scientific advisor to the rector of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

Not for the sake of history but for the genesis of problems, facts and proofs, for the sake of the decisive turning points of that genesis...By going back to the roots of these conceptions, back through the dust of times past, the scars of long use would disappear and they would be reborn to us as creatures full of life.", "56679268": "Eleny-Nicoleta Ionel is a Romanian mathematician whose research concerns symplectic geometry, including the study of the Gromov\u2013Witten invariants and Gopakumar\u2013Vafa invariant.

He is best remembered for his mathematical contributions, which include the invention of the Gunter's chain, the Gunter's quadrant, and the Gunter's scale. In 1620, he invented the first successful analogue device[2] which he developed to calculate logarithmic tangents.[3]/nHe was mentored in mathematics by Reverend Henry Briggs and eventually became a Gresham Professor of Astronomy, from 1619 until his death.[4]/nGunter was born in Hertfordshire in 1581. He was educated at Westminster School, and in 1599 he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford. He took orders, became a preacher in 1614, and in 1615 proceeded to the degree of bachelor in divinity.[5] He became rector of St. George's Church in Southwark.[6]/nMathematics, particularly the relationship between mathematics and the real world, was the one overriding interest throughout his life. In 1619, Sir Henry Savile put up money to fund Oxford University's first two science faculties, the chairs of astronomy and geometry. Gunter applied to become professor of geometry but Savile was famous for distrusting clever people, and Gunter's behaviour annoyed him intensely. As was his habit, Gunter arrived with his sector and quadrant, and began demonstrating how they could be used to calculate the position of stars or the distance of churches, until Savile could stand it no longer. \"Doe you call this reading of Geometric?\" he burst out. \"This is mere showing of tricks, man!\" and, according to a contemporary account, \"dismissed him with scorne.\"[7][8]/nHe was shortly thereafter championed by the far wealthier Earl of Bridgewater, who saw to it that on 6 March 1619 Gunter was appointed professor of astronomy in Gresham College, London. This post he held till his death.[5]/nWith Gunter's name are associated several useful inventions, descriptions of which are given in his treatises on the sector, cross-staff, bow, quadrant and other instruments. He contrived his sector about the year 1606, and wrote a description of it in Latin, but it was more than sixteen years afterwards before he allowed the book to appear in English. In 1620 he published his Canon triangulorum.[5][a]/nIn 1624 Gunter published a collection of his mathematical works. It was entitled The description and use of sector, the cross-staffe, and other instruments for such as are studious of mathematical practise. One of the most remarkable things about this book is that it was written, and published, in English not Latin. \"I am at the last contented that it should come forth in English,\" he wrote resignedly, \"Not that I think it worthy either of my labour or the publique view, but to satisfy their importunity who not understand the Latin yet were at the charge to buy the instrument.\"[7] It was a manual not for cloistered university fellows but for sailors and surveyors in real world./nThere is reason to believe that Gunter was the first to discover (in 1622 or 1625) that the magnetic needle does not retain the same declination in the same place at all times. By desire of James I he published in 1624 The Description and Use of His Majesties Dials in Whitehall Garden, the only one of his works which has not been reprinted. He coined the terms cosine and cotangent, and he suggested to Henry Briggs, his friend and colleague, the use of the arithmetical complement (see Briggs Arithmetica Logarithmica, cap. xv).[5] His practical inventions are briefly noted below:/nGunter's interest in geometry led him to develop a method of land surveying using triangulation. Linear measurements could be taken between topographical features such as corners of a field, and using triangulation the field or other area could be plotted on a plane, and its area calculated. A chain 66 feet (20\u00a0m) long, with intermediate measurements indicated, was chosen for the purpose, and is called Gunter's chain./nThe length of the chain chosen, 66 feet (20\u00a0m), being called a chain gives a unit easily converted to area.[9] Therefore, a parcel of 10 square chains gives 1 acre. The area of any parcel measured in chains will thereby be easily calculated./nGunter's quadrant is an instrument made of wood, brass or other substance, containing a kind of stereographic projection of the sphere on the plane of the equinoctial, the eye being supposed to be placed in one of the poles, so that the tropic, ecliptic, and horizon form the arcs of circles, but the hour circles are other curves, drawn by means of several altitudes of the sun for some particular latitude every year. This instrument is used to find the hour of the day, the sun's azimuth, etc., and other common problems of the sphere or globe, and also to take the altitude of an object in degrees.[5]/nA rare Gunter quadrant, made by Henry Sutton and dated 1657, can be described as follows: It is a conveniently sized and high-performance instrument that has two pin-hole sights, and the plumb line is inserted at the vertex. The front side is designed as a Gunter quadrant and the rear side as a trigonometric quadrant. The side with the astrolabe has hour lines, a calendar, zodiacs, star positions, astrolabe projections, and a vertical dial. The side with the geometric quadrants features several trigonometric functions, rules, a shadow quadrant, and the chorden line.[10]/nGunter's scale or Gunter's rule, generally called the \"Gunter\" by seamen, is a large plane scale, usually 2 feet (610\u00a0mm) long by about 1\u00bd inches broad (40\u00a0mm), engraved with various scales, or lines. On one side are placed the natural lines (as the line of chords, the line of sines, tangents, rhumbs, etc.), and on the other side the corresponding artificial or logarithmic ones. By means of this instrument questions in navigation, trigonometry, etc., are solved with the aid of a pair of compasses.[5]  It is a predecessor of the slide rule, a calculating aid used from the 17th century until the 1970s./nGunter's line, or line of numbers refers to the logarithmically divided scale, like the most common scales used on slide rules for multiplication and division./nA sail rig which resembles a gaff rig, with the gaff nearly vertical, is called a Gunter rig, or \"sliding gunter\" from its resemblance to a Gunter's rule.", "41737089": "Gilles Ch\u00e2telet (2 February 1944 \u2013 11 June 1999) was a French philosopher and mathematician.[1]/nCh\u00e2telet began studying at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure Fontenay-Saint-Cloud-Lyon in 1963.

He played for Buckinghamshire junior hockey. In later years, he managed the School chess club and, jointly, the School bridge club (which notably beat Eton College on one occasion)./nAfter school, he went to the University of Exeter (1971\u201375) where he took a BSc (Hons) degree in Mathematics, graduating in 1974, and a PGCE (Maths) in 1975.

During this time, he beat his Head of Department, Professor David Rees, at both chess and, at Rees' insistence, Go./nIn 1975, Brokenshire joined the Royal Navy as an Instructor - his father's career and service branch. He spent some time as Maths Instructor at HMS Fisgard, an Artificer apprentice training establishment, Torpoint, E. Cornwall. After training at Royal Naval College, Greenwich, and subsequent postings to Dartmouth, Westminster, Plymouth, Portsmouth and Faslane, his career developed as a submariner and later as a senior Royal Navy officer. His success on the Greenwich course encouraged him to take a second degree, this time an Open University BA degree in Science. As 2007 Royal Navy chess champion and President of the Combined Services Chess Association,[3] he represented the RN at the NATO Chess championship several years running, creating for himself an international standing in military chess.[4]/nIn later years, he commanded two shore establishments: firstly Northwood (1992\u201393) and later, as a Commodore, HMS Raleigh (2000\u201303) - the Navy's main Torpoint training centre - the family lived at nearby Trevol House.[1] In 2003, on the occasion of his retirement, the family moved back to their house in Stubbington, Hampshire, and he was awarded a CBE for services rendered.[5]/nFollowing the end of his Royal Navy career, Brokenshire was appointed as Commodore of the UK Sea Cadet Corps. As such, he toured and inspected as many local associations as he could. On one such visit to Essex, he met his 6th cousin and fellow Exeter-graduate, the local MP James Brokenshire (1968-2021), and remained in regular contact.[citation needed]/nBrokenshire was accepted into the Inner Magic Circle, and became an occasional professional / semi-professional magic performer. He was regularly used by his charities as a high-profile magic performer, in particular, performing table magic for members of the British Royal Family at various charitable occasions.[1] He was always able to find a suitable magic trick for any occasion, particularly for young children, and carried his \"magic\" bag with him at all times./nIn his spare time, Brokenshire became a world-class puzzling expert. Specialising in combinatorial and mechanical puzzles, he was in regular contact with puzzle researchers, designers, makers, enthusiasts and other specialists around the world. He introduced some novel solutions to existing problems, and was exceptionally quick to solve new problems. He was retained by a number of major puzzles companies as a consultant to offer an assessment on the viability of proposed puzzles. His personal puzzle collection was considered among the largest in the UK.[6] He organised and held G4G Celebration of Mind meetings at his house.[7]/nHistorically, the famous puzzlist Henry Dudeney (1857-1930) announced a particularly-difficult chessboard (aka checkerboard) dissection puzzle in one of his first puzzle books and asserted that it had a \"unique\", or single, solution. Numerous people tried and failed to solve this puzzle, such that it became famously known as the \"Dudeney Problem\". Some years later, true to his word, Dudeney gave his \"unique\" solution in one of his last puzzle books. Later still, Dudeney's former collaborator, Sam Loyd (1841-1911), asserted his own abilities, and disproved Dudeney's assertion of uniqueness, by giving a second \"unique\" solution in one of his puzzle books. This same problem then became known as the \"Dudeney-Loyd problem\". Today, that same problem is classified as the \"Dudeney-Loyd-Brokenshire problem\" when Brokenshire found the third \"unique\" solution, after a gap of about 100 years.[8] Substantial further analysis has shown that there were only ever three solutions, despite Dudeney's original claim.

He took his first English courses in high school. Enrolled in the Canadian Armed Forces to pursue university-level studies, he obtained a masters of mathematics from the University of Ottawa. During the three years of his military service, he was posted to National Defence headquarters in Ottawa as counsellor in mathematics and also taught young officers at the Coll\u00e8ge militaire royal de Saint-Jean.[1]/nAfter his service, he began teaching mathematics and statistics at the University of Ottawa and registered at McGill University to study the philosophy of mathematics and epistemology.

His military reforms, which included the introduction of mass conscription (lev\u00e9e en masse), were instrumental in transforming the French Revolutionary Army into an effective fighting force./nCarnot was elected to the National Convention in 1792, and a year later he became a member of the Committee of Public Safety, where he directed the French war effort as one of the Ministers of War during the War of the First Coalition. He oversaw the reorganization of the army, imposed discipline, and significantly expanded the French force through the imposition of mass conscription. Credited with France's renewed military success from 1793 to 1794, Carnot came to be known as the \"Organizer of Victory\". Increasingly disillusioned with the radical politics of the Montagnards, Carnot broke with Maximilien Robespierre and played a role in the latter's overthrow on 9 Thermidor and subsequent execution. He became one of the five initial members of the Directory but was ousted after the Coup of 18 Fructidor in 1797 and went into exile./nFollowing Napoleon's rise to power, Carnot returned to France and in 1800 was briefly Minister of War. A fervent Republican, he chose to withdraw from public life after Napoleon's coronation as Emperor. In 1812, he returned to serve under Napoleon and oversaw the defense of Antwerp against the Sixth Coalition, and during the Hundred Days he was Napoleon's Minister of the Interior. Carnot was exiled after the second Bourbon Restoration and died in Magdeburg, Prussia in 1823./nIn addition to his political career, Carnot was also an eminent mathematician. His 1803 G\u00e9om\u00e9trie de position is considered a pioneering work in the field of projective geometry. He is also remembered for developing the Carnot wall, a system of fortification that became widely employed in continental Europe during the 19th century./nCarnot was born on 13 May 1753 in the village of Nolay, in Burgundy, as the son of a local judge and royal notary, Claude Carnot and his wife, Marguerite Pothier. He was the second oldest of seven children. At the age of fourteen, Lazare and his brother were enrolled at the Coll\u00e8ge d'Autun, where he focused on the study of philosophy and the classics. He held a strong belief in stoic philosophy and was deeply influenced by Roman civilization. When he turned fifteen, he left school in Autun to strengthen his philosophical knowledge and study under the Society of the Priests of Saint Sulpice. During his short time with them, he studied logic, mathematics and theology under the Abb\u00e9 Bison. Impressed with Lazare's work as a scholar, the duc d'Aumont\u00a0[fr] (Marquis de Nolay) recommended a military career for the youngster. Carnot was soon sent by his father to the Aumont residence to further his education. Here, he was enrolled in M. de Longpr\u00e9's pension school in 1770 until he was ready to enter one of two prestigious engineering and artillery schools in Paris. A year later, in February 1771, he was ranked the third highest among twelve who were chosen out of his class of more than one hundred who took the entrance exams. It was at this point when he entered the \u00c9cole royale du g\u00e9nie de M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, appointed as a second lieutenant. Studies at the M\u00e9zi\u00e8res included geometry, mechanics, geometrical designing, geography, hydraulics and material preparation. On 1 January 1773 he graduated the school, ranked as a first lieutenant. He was eighteen years old.[1]/nCarnot obtained a commission as a lieutenant in Louis Joseph, Prince of Cond\u00e9's engineer corps. At this moment, he made a name for himself both in the line of (physics) theoretical engineering and in his work in the field of fortifications. While in the army, stationed in Calais, Cherbourg and B\u00e9thune, he continued his study of mathematics. In December 1783, he received a promotion to the rank of captain.[2] In 1784 he published his first work Essay on Machines, which contained a statement that foreshadowed the principle of energy as applied to a falling weight, and the earliest proof that kinetic energy is lost in the collision of imperfectly elastic bodies. This publication earned him the honor of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, Arts et Belles-Lettres de Dijon. Another turning point was his essay on Vauban in which he praised the engineer on his works while at the same time developing his own career as a writer/engineer. Vauban's work had a profound effect on his work as a general and engineer. In 1786 he became acquainted with Robespierre, a lawyer in Arras, in the local literary club. In 1788 he returned to B\u00e9thune, where he was imprisoned with a lettre de cachet, because of a broken promise to marry a woman from Dijon. After his release he was stationed in Aire-sur-la-Lys and married Sophie Dupont from Saint-Omer in May 1791. For two months he served as president of the local literary society.[3]/nIn September 1791 he became a delegate for Pas-de-Calais  to the Legislature. While a member of the Legislative Assembly, Carnot was elected to the Committee of Public Instruction. He believed that all citizens should be educated. As a member of that committee, he wrote a series of reforms for the teaching and educational systems, but they were not implemented due to the violent social and economic climate of the Revolution./nAfter the Legislative Assembly was dissolved, Carnot was elected to the National Convention in September 1792. He spent the last few months of 1792 on a mission to Bayonne, organizing the military defense effort in an attempt to ward off any possible attacks from Spain. Upon returning to Paris, Carnot voted for the death of Louis XVI, although he had been absent for the debates surrounding his trial.[4] By mid-February Carnot proposed that annexation be undertaken on behalf of French interests whether or not the people to be annexed so wished.[5]/nOn 14 August 1793 Carnot was elected to the Committee of Public Safety, where he took charge of the military situation as one of the Ministers of War.[4] He was friendly with Johan Valckenaer who tried to hasten the invasion of the Dutch Republic./nWith the establishment of the Directory in 1795, Carnot became one of the five initial directors. For the first year, the Directors did well working harmoniously together as well as with the Councils. However, difference of political views led to a schism between Carnot and \u00c9tienne-Fran\u00e7ois Letourneur, followed by Fran\u00e7ois de Barth\u00e9lemy, on the one side, and the triumvirate of Paul Fran\u00e7ois Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rewbell, and Louis Marie de La R\u00e9velli\u00e8re-L\u00e9peaux on the other side. Carnot and Barth\u00e9lemy supported concessions to end the war, and hoped to oust the triumvirate and replace them with more conservative men. After Letourneur had been replaced by another close collaborator of Carnot, Fran\u00e7ois de Barth\u00e9lemy, both of them, alongside many deputies in the Council of Five Hundred, were ousted in the Coup of 18 Fructidor (4 September 1797), engineered by Generals Napoleon Bonaparte (originally, Carnot's prot\u00e9g\u00e9) and Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Charles Augereau. Carnot took refuge in Geneva, and there in 1797 issued his La m\u00e9taphysique du calcul infinit\u00e9simal./nThe creation of the French Revolutionary Army was largely due to his powers of organization and enforcing discipline. In order to raise more troops for the war, Carnot introduced conscription: the lev\u00e9e en masse approved by the National Convention was able to raise France's army from 645,000 troops in mid-1793 to 1,500,000 in September 1794. He was the first to execute the modern waging of war with mass armies and strategic planning realized by the Revolution. As a military engineer, Carnot favored fortresses and defensive strategies.[6] He developed innovative defensive designs for forts, including the Carnot wall, named after him. However, with the constant invasions he decided to take his strategic planning to an offensive strike. From his intellect sprang the maneuvers and organization that turned the tides of war from 1793 to 1794.[7] The basic idea was to have a massive army separated into several units that could move more quickly than the enemy and attack from the flanks rather than head on, which had led to resounding defeats before Carnot was elected to the Committee of Public Safety. This tactic was extremely successful against the more traditional tactics of existing European armies. It was his initiative to train the conscripts in the art of war and to place new recruits with experienced soldiers rather than having a massive volunteer army without any real idea of how to wage battle./nOnce the problem of troop numbers had been solved, Carnot turned his administrative skills to the supplies that this massive army would need. Many of the munitions and supplies were in short supply: copper was lacking for guns so he ordered church bells seized in order to melt them down; saltpeter was lacking and he called chemistry to his aid; leather for boots was scarce so he demanded and secured new methods for tanning. He quickly organized the army and helped to turn the tide of the war. It added significantly to discontent with the course of the Revolution in still Bourbon-loyalist areas \u2013 such as the Vend\u00e9e, which had broken out in open revolt 5 months earlier \u2013 but the government of the time considered it a success, and Carnot became known as the Organizer of Victory. [4] In autumn 1793, he took charge of French columns on the Northern Front, and contributed to Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's victory in the Battle of Wattignies./nCarnot met Robespierre for the first time in Arras where he was assigned for military duty and shortly after Robespierre finished his legal studies. Both of them were members of the literary club, and they sung Societe des Rosati together. The group was founded in 1778 and was inspired by the works of Chapelle, La Fontaine, and Chaulieu. It was here where they became acquaintances and eventually friends. Robespierre preceded Carnot into the Academy of Arras entering in April 1784 while he entered in 1786.[8]/nWhile being an active member of the Committee of Public Safety in 1794, tensions between Carnot and Robespierre began to rise massively. During his time on the committee, which was heavily radical, Carnot signed a total of 43 decrees and drafted 18 of them. Most of them dealt with military tactics and education.[9] Despite leaning on Jacobin beliefs, Carnot was considered the \"conservative\" of his half. He was not an official member of the radical group and therefore took on his own independent beliefs in regards to many issues.[10] One of these issues included Robespierre's proposal on an egalitarian social system with which he feverishly disagreed.[11]/nAlthough he had taken no steps to oppose the Reign of Terror, he and some other technocrats on the committee, including Robert Lindet and Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau, turned on Maximilien Robespierre and his allies during the Thermidorian Reaction by having him arrested. Robespierre was later killed along with 21 of his followers. Shortly after Robespierre's fall, Carnot was charged for his role during the time but the charges were quickly dismissed when he became a member of the Directory./nIn 1795, Carnot appointed Napoleon Bonaparte as general in chief of the Army of Italy. He is known to be the only member of the Directory to have supported Napoleon during this time.[12]/nIn 1800 Bonaparte appointed Carnot as Minister of War, and he served in that office at the time of the Battle of Marengo. In 1802 he voted against the establishment of Napoleon's Consular powers for life and the passing of the title to his children, for as Carnot said when speaking of the power necessary to govern a state \"If this power is the appendage of a hereditary family it becomes despotic.\"/nAfter Napoleon crowned himself emperor on 2 December 1804, Carnot's republican convictions precluded his acceptance of high office under the First French Empire, and he resigned from public life. Probably in response to the fall of the fortress of Vlissingen to the British during the Walcheren Campaign in 1809, Napoleon employed Carnot to write a treatise describing how fortifications could be improved, for the use of the \u00c9cole militaire de Metz\u00a0[fr]. Building on the theories of the controversial engineer Montalembert, Carnot advanced ideas on how the long established bastioned system of fortification could be modified for close defense and to allow for counter attack by the besieged garrison./nIn 1812, Carnot returned to office in defense of Napoleon during the disastrous invasion of Russia and was assigned the defense of Antwerp against the Sixth Coalition. He surrendered only at the demand of the Count of Artois, the younger brother of Louis XVIII who later reigned as Charles X. He was later made a Count of the Empire by Napoleon as Lazare Nicolas Marguerite, Comte Carnot. During the Hundred Days, Carnot served as Minister of the Interior for Napoleon, and was exiled as a regicide during the White Terror after the Second Restoration during the reign of Louis XVIII./nIn 1803 Carnot produced his G\u00e9om\u00e9trie de position. This work deals with projective rather than descriptive geometry.\nCarnot is responsible for initiating the use of cross-ratios:\n\"He was the first to introduce the cross (anharmonic) ratio of four points of a line taking account of its sign, thereby sharpening Pappus' concept. He then proved that this ratio is invariant for the four points obtained by cutting four lines of a pencil of lines with different secants. In this way, he established the harmonic properties of the complete quadrilateral.\"[13] This approach to geometry was used by Karl von Staudt four decades later to set a new foundation to mathematics./nThe Borda\u2013Carnot equation in fluid dynamics and several theorems in geometry are named after him: one that describes a property of the incircle and the circumcircle of triangle, one that describes a relation between triangles and conic sections and one that describes a property of certain perpendiculars on triangle sides./nPublished in 1810 under the title \"Trait\u00e9 de la D\u00e9fense des Places Fortes\", his ideas on fortification were further developed in the third edition which was published in 1812. An English translation, \"A Treatise on the Defence of Fortified Places\" was published in 1814. Although few of his proposals were accepted by mainstream engineers, the Carnot wall, a detached wall at the foot of the escarp, became a common feature in fortifications built in the mid-19th century.[14]/nHe lived in Warsaw, Congress Poland, and then moved to the Kingdom of Prussia, where he died in the city of Magdeburg. Carnot's remains were interred at the Panth\u00e9on in 1889, at the same time as those of Th\u00e9ophile Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne, Jean-Baptiste Baudin, and Fran\u00e7ois S\u00e9verin Marceau-Desgraviers./nCarnot survived all the phases of the French Revolution, from its beginnings in 1789 until the fall of Napoleon in 1815. On the social and political front, Carnot was the author of many reforms sought to improve the country. One of these was the proposal for compulsory public education for all citizens. He also penned a proposal for the new Constitution which included the \"Declaration of the Duties of the Citizens\" that held that there should be not only education but military service for all citizens of France between the ages of twenty and twenty-five. These proposals were in accordance with the Revolutionaries' thinking at the time, which held that men and women should be honored through ability and intelligence rather than through birthright, even though Carnot himself was nobly born./nHe also published essays about engineering theory.\nEssai sur les machines en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral won honorable mention from the Academie sur Science of Paris in 1780. It was revised and published in 1783. In this he outlined a mathematical theory of power transmission in mechanical systems. \nHis essay Principes fondamentaux de l'\u00e9quilibre et du mouvement 1803 was a further revision and expansion of the earlier work. This was \"the first theoretical analysis of engineering mechanics\". In this \"he went on to analyze the movement of energy from one part of the system to another; he found that power is transmitted most efficiently, and the largest amount of useful work done, when friction, turbulence, and other energy wasting factors are kept to a minimum. This was an early and incomplete approach to the general law of conservation of energy.\"[citation needed]/nCarnot's son Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot was influenced by his father's work when he undertook his research into the thermal efficiency of steam engines./nLazare Carnot's name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.", "16374685": "Carlos Conca (born November 3, 1954) is a Chilean applied mathematician, engineer and scientist.[1] He is the first Chilean scientist to be recognized by the French government with a distinction in the field of Exact and Natural Sciences./nHe was awarded with the Premio Nacional de Ciencias Exactas de Chile in 2004./nCarlos Concha was born in the capital Santiago de Chile (Chile) on November 3, 1954.

Fine's father in addition to being a physician was a strong student in astronomy.[2] He had created many astronomical instruments and published a treatise which was one of the few astronomical incunabula of French origin.[2]/nFine's university was known as a leading center at Paris for the study of scholastic philosophy and theology.[3] There he fostered his editing ability and later printed many editions of writings from scholars.[3] It is believed that his career ended abruptly when he was imprisoned, for reasons that are highly disputed.[3]/nIn 1531, he was appointed to the chair of mathematics at the Coll\u00e8ge Royal (the present Coll\u00e8ge de France), founded by King Francis I, where he taught until his death.[4][5]/nIn time, as the first chair of mathematics he had become the leading mathematicians of France.[3] Arguably, one of his most significant contributions to sciences is his published compilation of the four main areas of mathematics that he named Protomathesis.[3] Fine was known by his peers to be much more than just a mathematician, though. He taught at the French College Royal as the first Royal Lecturer in mathematics, he made instruments, and oversaw Paris's printing houses.[3] He was also influential to the lives of students, particularly Pedro Nunes and Petrus Ramus as well as many others, and inspired them to continue their scholastic endeavors.[3]/nAlthough he leaves a great legacy in regard to his published papers of mathematics, he suffered financial problems and legal issues throughout his career.[3] He worked as an illustrator and proof reader for Paris's print houses in hopes relieving the financial strain brought on by his six children and his father's death.[3] Unfortunately, his efforts were not enough which added to his family's poverty drastically after he died. Making the matters worse for his children, his wife died shortly after Fine's death.[3]/nFine made contribution to mathematics.[6] He was the first mathematics teacher to be a royal lecturer,[6] and popularized mathematical teaching all over France.[6] He was tasked with making math more transparent and to reform the curriculum that was being taught in France at the time.[6] Fine was faced with having to incorporate practical branches of math that could be used in other areas like medicine, law, and theology.[6]/nTo display his new teachings and developments, he released a collection of his work through his Protomathesis.[6] This collection included his teaching on practical math, not only traditional mathematics.[6] The Protomathesis also incorporated both practical and theoretical teachings, which were completely new to France, and changed the way that mathematics was taught and viewed.[6] His study and teachings of mathematics allowed him to also be prolific in a wide range of mathematical fields, including practical geometry, arithmetic, optics, gnomonics, astronomy and instrumentalism.[7]/nFine proposed several approximations to the value of pi. He gave it as (22+2/9)/7 \u2248 3.1746 in 1544. Later, he gave 47/15 \u2248 3.1333 and, in De rebus mathematicis (1556), he gave 3+11/78 \u2248 3.1410.[citation needed]/nIn 1542 Fine published the astronomy textbook De mundi sphaera (On the Heavenly Spheres), which included woodcut illustrations.[8] His writing on astronomy included guides to the use of astronomical equipment and methods (e.g. the ancient practice of determining longitude through the coordinated observation of lunar eclipses from two fixed points with enough distance between them to make the phenomena appear at different times of the night). He also described more recent innovations, such as an instrument he called a m\u00e9th\u00e9oroscope (an astrolabe modified by adding a compass)./nExplanatory work was complemented by direct contributions. His woodcut map of France (1525) is one of the first of its kind. He constructed an ivory sundial in 1524, which still exists.[9]/nFine's heart-shaped (cordiform) map projection of 1531 was frequently employed by other cartographers, including Peter Apian and Gerardus Mercator.[10] The map bore a dedicatory inscription that said:/nOronce Fine of the Dauphiny to the Reader: We offer to you, Dear Reader, a representation of the entire world according to the views of modern Geographers and Hydrographers, preserving the proportion of the centre to both the Equator and the latitudes, laid out on a plane in the form of a double human heart; of which the left comprises the northern part and the right the Southern part of the World. Therefore, receive this small gift kindly; and thank Christian Wechel, by whose good will and at whose expense I have shared it with you. Farewell, July, 1531.[11]/nFine attempted to reconcile discoveries in the New World with old medieval legends and information (derived from Ptolemy) regarding the Orient. Thus, on one of his two world maps, Nova Universi Orbis Descriptio (1531), the legend marked Asia covers both North America and Asia, which were represented as one landmass. He used the toponym \"America\" for South America, and thus Marco Polo's Mangi, Tangut and Catay appear on the shores of the present-day Gulf of Mexico. On the same map, Fine drew Terra Australis to the south, including the legend \"recently discovered but not yet completely explored\", by which he meant the discovery of Tierra del Fuego by Ferdinand Magellan.[12]/nFine's cosmography was derived from the German mathematician and cosmographer Johannes Sch\u00f6ner.[13] In his study of Sch\u00f6ner's globes, Franz von Wieser found that the derivation of Fine's mappemonde from them was \"unmistakeable (unverkennbar)\"; he said \"Orontius Finaeus took from Sch\u00f6ner not only the Brasilie Regio, but the whole Austral Continent, the Strait of Magellan, and above all the whole arrangement of lands; in a word, the mappemonde of Oronce Fine is a copy of Sch\u00f6ner's\".[14] Lucien Gallois also noted the undeniable ressemblance parfaite between Fin\u00e9's 1531 mappemonde and Sch\u00f6ner's globe of 1533.[15] As Sch\u00f6ner's globe of 1523, which also closely resembled Fine's mappemonde, was not identified until 1925 by Frederik (F.C.) Wieder, Gallois was forced to argue that Fine, who said he had been working on his mappemonde since 1521, had had direct or indirect personal communication with Sch\u00f6ner or had drawn upon his 1515 Luculentissima descriptio. Wieder's identification of Sch\u00f6ner's map gores of 1523 strengthens Gallois' case for Fine's reliance upon Sch\u00f6ner.[16]/nFine's 1536 world map bore a dedicatory inscription in the lower left corner, which stated:/nABOUT FIFTEEN years since, Dear Reader, we first designed, in the shape of a human heart, this universal map of the world, in gratitude to the Most Christian and Most Mighty Francis, King of the French, our most clement Maecenas. For while we saw it pleased the King, a Polymath, and uncommon Geographer, and was praised by many, even in foreign countries, I wanted finally to communicate the same description of the whole globe to all students of Mathematics: which, after variations in fortune and crises in the studies we pursued, which up to now have been a hindrance to us, we have finally done at our own risk. And so, augmented and corrected by many observations of modern hydrographers, the same heart-shaped geographical image we present to yourself, devoted reader and to all men of goodwill of a wise and liberal mind. It remains, therefore, that you will not refuse to accept this labour and industry of ours which has a human appearance, and consult it fairly and well. Finally, while we strive ever more earnestly for the favour and generosity of our Most Christian and magnificent King, whose happiness and success you eagerly desire, we have shared this with you. Farewell, from Paris.[17]/nThe same map bore another inscription in the lower right corner, which explained how to use the map to accurately measure the distances between places shown on it:/nFrom the description of the world in this map, for any two locations of which the longitudes and latitudes are given (but not exceeding ninety degrees), close to the true direct distance between them can be calculated. Having thus reckoned the longitudes and latitudes of the places, their places in the chart being selected at the same time, place one foot of the compasses over the other places, and extend the other over the rest. Then the compasses trace an invariant straight line, which divides the figure equally, and the degrees are distributed between them; and you will observe how many degrees the compasses take in. If you multiply these by 62 miles, or 31 French leagues, or 20 common ones, by a tenth or more, that way, you will obtain the distances of any of these places.[18]/nFine died in Paris at age 60./nJean Clouet is said to have painted a portrait of Fine in 1530, when Fine was 36.

It was during Dwijendranath's lifetime that Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay and Rabindranath Tagore's 'Strong Writing Set Bengali Literature to the Peak of Glory'.[10] Although every poet of Bengal at that time was influenced by Madhusudan more or less, Dwijendranath was above this influence.[1] Rather, it was Madhusudan who welcomed Dwijendranath as the poet of the future.[11]/nDespite being a highly talented poet, the person Dwijendranath was a very messy man. Rabindranath writes that the torn manuscripts of the dreamy poems were scattered all over the Jorasanko Thakur Bari. If they had been collected and published, it would have been a valuable edition of the book.[1]/nDwijendranath Tagore was a 'true philosopher'. He assisted in the establishment and management of two philosophical organizations, the National Society and the Vidvajjan Samagam. He was also deeply interested in Gita philosophy.[12]/nHis main philosophy is Tattwabidya (in three volumes, 1866-1868). This book is a pioneering book in the history of Bengali philosophy. This national book has not been published in Bengali before. His other two philosophical works are Advaita Mater Samalochana (1896) and Aryadharma O Boudhadharmer Ghat-Protighat (1899).[1]/nDwijendranath Tagore was a prolific mathematician. He wrote some books in English: a book on boxometry (Baksamiti, it is regarding the structure of the box) (1913), ontology (1871) and geometry.[3][13]/nHe was a pioneer in many spheres of far-reaching importance. He invented the shorthand in 'Bengali and wrote a manual on it in verse. He wrote a book on Geometry in which the 12th Axiom had been replaced by new ones. His writings on Boxometry, or science of paper-folding have fascinated scholars of mathematics.[2][4]/nHe edited Tattwabodhini Patrika for 25 long years from 1884. He also founded the Hitavadi Patrika. Dwijendranath wanted to continue publishing the Tattvabodhini Patrika.[13] But his other brother Jyotirindranath Tagore proposed to start a new magazine called Bharati. Although Dwijendranath was in charge of editing the paper, it was mainly run by Jyotirindranath.[1][3]/nFor his outstanding contribution to Bengali literature, he was elected President of the Bangiya Sahitya Parishad from 1897 to 1900. He was the priest at the session of the Bengal Literary Conference in 1914.[1][3]/nWhen the income of his zamindari declined during the Pabna Rebellion in 1873, he recommended strict measures against the peasants to \"restore peace\".[14][3]/nDwijendranath used to do various experiments. He was one of the pioneers in the introduction of Bangla script or short hand. He also introduced sign script in the form of poems.[1]  He also played a leading role in introducing the use of notation in Bengali songs. At that time, none other than Kshetramohan Goswami, an assistant to King Saurindra Mohan Tagore, did this work.[9] In 1913, Dwijendranath also wrote a book on the structure of the box called Baksamiti.[8] His hobby was to wrap paper in various shapes.[9]/nFrom 1866 to 1871 he held the post of Acharya of the Adi Brahmo Samaj. He traveled to Dhaka with his father Debendranath during the inaugural phase of the Dhaka Brahmo Samaj under the supervision of Braja Sundar Mitra.[15]/nDwijendranath was closely associated with Hindu Mela. He also composed patriotic songs for Hindu Mela.[8] Songwriting was his habit. The Brahma Sangeet, Karo Tar Nam Gaan, Jatadin Rahe Deha Pran, composed by him was used for prayer for 7th Pous for many years. His Brahma songs are also widely sung in the general prayers of the Brahmo Samaj.[3] One of his popular patriotic songs written for the Hindu Mela was Malin Mukhchandrama Bharat Tomari.[13]/nDwijendranath spent the last twenty years of his life in Santiniketan in the company of nature through the practice of knowledge and writing. He used to compose humorous quatrains with the Ashramikas of Santiniketan. These rhymes were published in Santiniketan. His sense of humor became the talk of the town in Santiniketan.[11] In Santiniketan, his friendships with birds, squirrels and crows were proverbial.[9] He learned many things. But philosophy was at the center of his interest. He used to set up majlis to take other scholars including Rabindranath. In this meeting he used to recite his compositions. If he did not understand anything, Bidhusekhar would seek the help of Shastri and Kshitimohan Sen.[11]/nRabindranath used to call him Barodada. On his return from South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi and Charles Freer Andrews visited Santiniketan and met Dwijendranath, who also addressed him as Barodada.[11] With the intention of publishing a letter written by Dwijendranath in a newspaper, Mahatma Gandhi wrote as a preface, \u201cYou know Dwijendranath. He was the eldest brother of Sri Rabindranath Tagore and he lived life of a monk practically like  his father Debendranath Tagore\".[16]/nDwijendranath Tagore died in Shantiniketan on 19 January 1926.[3][6]/nDwijendranath had five sons - Dipendranath, Arunendranath, Nitindranath, Sudhindranath and Kripendranath. Among them Sudhindranath Tagore (1869-1929) was a prominent writer. He had written several poems, novels and short stories. In 1891 he published a magazine called Sadhana. He was the editor of this magazine. Later, Rabindranath took over the responsibility of editing this magazine. Over time, the paper merged with Bharati.[1]/nAmong his grandsons, Dipendranath's son Dinendranath Tagore (1882-1935) was a prominent musician. He could pick it up once he heard the song. Although Rabindranath composed self-composed songs, he had trouble memorizing them or composing his notation. Dinendranath used to do this. He is one of the leading composers of Rabindra Sangeet. Rabindranath used to call him \"Kandari of all songs\".[1]/nSoumendranath Tagore (1910-1984), son of Sudhindranath, another son of Dwijendranath, was a prominent orator. His name was well-known in the cultural world in the 1960s and 1970s.[1] He was associated with the communist movement in her early life.[8] Krishna Rimbu (1927-2000), daughter of Anna Roy, a daughter of Sudhindranath, is an international name in the art world. Jean Rimbu was the head of the Schlumberger Company (one of the richest in the world). Madame Rimbu was an art collector, textile researcher and an influential figure in international politics and the art world./nDwijendranath is also the ancestor of film actress Sharmila Tagore.

He criticized Georg Cantor's work on set theory, and was quoted by Weber (1893) as having said, \"Die ganzen Zahlen hat der liebe Gott gemacht, alles andere ist Menschenwerk\" (\"God made the integers, all else is the work of man\").[1] Kronecker was a student and life-long friend of Ernst Kummer./nLeopold Kronecker was born on 7 December 1823 in Liegnitz, Prussia (now Legnica, Poland) in a wealthy Jewish family. His parents, Isidor and Johanna (n\u00e9e Prausnitzep), took care of their children's education and provided them with private tutoring at home\u2014Leopold's younger brother Hugo Kronecker would also follow a scientific path, later becoming a notable physiologist. Kronecker then went to the Liegnitz Gymnasium where he was interested in a wide range of topics including science, history and philosophy, while also practicing gymnastics and swimming. At the gymnasium he was taught by Ernst Kummer, who noticed and encouraged the boy's interest in mathematics.[2]/nIn 1841 Kronecker became a student at the University of Berlin where his interest did not immediately focus on mathematics, but rather spread over several subjects including astronomy and philosophy. He spent the summer of 1843 at the University of Bonn studying astronomy and 1843\u201344 at the University of Breslau following his former teacher Kummer. Back in Berlin, Kronecker studied mathematics with Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and in 1845 defended his dissertation in algebraic number theory written under Dirichlet's supervision.[3]/nAfter obtaining his degree, Kronecker did not follow his interest in research on an academic career path. He went back to his hometown to manage a large farming estate built up by his mother's uncle, a former banker. In 1848 he married his cousin Fanny Prausnitzer, and the couple had six children. For several years Kronecker focused on business, and although he continued to study mathematics as a hobby and corresponded with Kummer, he published no mathematical results.[4] In 1853 he wrote a memoir on the algebraic solvability of equations extending the work of \u00c9variste Galois on the theory of equations./nDue to his business activity, Kronecker was financially comfortable, and thus he could return to Berlin in 1855 to pursue mathematics as a private scholar. Dirichlet, whose wife Rebecka came from the wealthy Mendelssohn family, had introduced Kronecker to the Berlin elite. He became a close friend of Karl Weierstrass, who had recently joined the university, and his former teacher Kummer who had just taken over Dirichlet's mathematics chair.[2] Over the following years Kronecker published numerous papers resulting from his previous years' independent research. As a result of this published research, he was elected a member of the Berlin Academy in 1861./nAlthough he held no official university position, Kronecker had the right as a member of the Academy to hold classes at the University of Berlin and he decided to do so, starting in 1862. In 1866, when Riemann died, Kronecker was offered the mathematics chair at the University of G\u00f6ttingen (previously held by Carl Friedrich Gauss and Dirichlet), but he refused, preferring to keep his position at the Academy. Only in 1883, when Kummer retired from the university, was Kronecker invited to succeed him and became an ordinary professor.[5] Kronecker was the supervisor of Kurt Hensel, Adolf Kneser, Mathias Lerch, and Franz Mertens, amongst others./nHis philosophical view of mathematics put him in conflict with several mathematicians over the years, notably straining his relationship with Weierstrass, who almost decided to leave the university in 1888.[3] Kronecker died on 29 December 1891 in Berlin, several months after the death of his wife. In the last year of his life, he converted to Christianity.[2] He is buried in the Alter St Matth\u00e4us Kirchhof cemetery in Berlin-Sch\u00f6neberg, close to Gustav Kirchhoff./nAn important part of Kronecker's research focused on number theory and algebra. In an 1853 paper on the theory of equations and Galois theory he formulated the Kronecker\u2013Weber theorem, without however offering a definitive proof (the theorem was proved completely much later by David Hilbert). He also introduced the structure theorem for finitely-generated abelian groups. Kronecker studied elliptic functions and conjectured his \"liebster Jugendtraum\" (\"dearest dream of youth\"), a generalization that was later put forward by Hilbert in a modified form as his twelfth problem.[6] In an 1850 paper, On the Solution of the General Equation of the Fifth Degree, Kronecker solved the quintic equation by applying group theory (though his solution was not in terms of radicals: that was already proven impossible by the Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem)./nIn algebraic number theory Kronecker introduced the theory of divisors as an alternative to Dedekind's theory of ideals, which he did not find acceptable for philosophical reasons. Although the general adoption of Dedekind's approach led Kronecker's theory to be ignored for a long time, his divisors were found useful and were revived by several mathematicians in the 20th century.[7]/nKronecker also contributed to the concept of continuity, reconstructing the form of irrational numbers in real numbers. In analysis, Kronecker rejected the formulation of a continuous, nowhere differentiable function by his colleague, Karl Weierstrass./nAlso named for Kronecker are the Kronecker limit formula, Kronecker's congruence, Kronecker delta, Kronecker comb, Kronecker symbol, Kronecker product, Kronecker's method for factorizing polynomials, Kronecker substitution, Kronecker's theorem in number theory, Kronecker's lemma, and Eisenstein\u2013Kronecker numbers./nKronecker's finitism made him a forerunner of intuitionism in foundations of mathematics./nKronecker was elected as a member of several academies:[2]/nThe 25624 Kronecker asteroid is named after him.", "72539128": "Elja Arjas (born February 9, 1943 in Tampere) is a Finnish mathematician and statistician.

In 1922, the Yale University Observatory appointed Barney as a research assistant, a title she held until 1949, when she was promoted to research associate.[1] The Observatory, like many other university observatories, was allocating significant resources to astronomy, thanks to the development of telescope-mounted cameras. At the beginning of her career in astronomy, Barney worked under Frank Schlesinger; she plotted the position of stars from photographic plates and worked on the calculations of their celestial coordinates from their positions on the plates.[5] The work was tedious, which Schlesinger thought to be suitable for women incapable of theoretical research.[6] Despite this influence, she developed several methods that increased both the accuracy and speed of astronomic measurements, including the use of a machine that automatically centered the photographic plates.[3]/nIn 1941, when Schlesinger retired, Barney took over full supervision of the cataloguing. Under her direction, the measurements of the photographic plates were completed at the IBM Watson Scientific Laboratory using a new electronic device that advanced the reduction of eye strain and increased accuracy.[4] Her life's work, completed over 23 years, contributed to the Yale Observatory Zone Catalog, a series of star catalogs published by the Yale Observatory for 1939 to 1983, containing approximately 400,000 stars, and influenced the Bright Star Catalogue.[2] Her individual contribution to these star catalogues recorded the position, magnitude, and proper motion of approximately 150,000 stars.

His forefathers for several generations had been clothiers in the town, William was the youngest of eight children. After receiving a classical education at the local grammar school he was admitted, in 1773, a commoner of Wadham College, Oxford. Here he began the study of Hebrew, and had in a short time made sufficient progress to obtain an exhibition. He became a scholar of his college, and, as he had successfully studied Hebrew to obtain one exhibition, now mastered botany to gain another. His studies in botany determined his choice of a profession in the direction of physic. He made, however, one more learned digression, and, after graduating B.A. in 1776, was elected assistant tutor to Dr. White, Laudian Professor of Arabic. After giving some lectures on Arabic, Austin in 1779 came to London and began his medical studies at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Percival Pott, the famous surgeon, formed a high opinion of Austin, and said to Earle, his colleague: 'You will see Austin at the head of his profession.' Austin went back to Oxford, and proceeded M.A. 1780, M.B. 1782, M.D. 1783.[1]/nIn 1781 Austin published the commentary, An Examination of the First Six Books of Euclid's Elements. In the same year, and after he had begun to practice as a physician at Oxford, he lectured on mathematics during the absence of John Smith, the Savilian Professor of Geometry. In 1784 he planned, but did not deliver, a course of lectures on physiology, and in 1785 he was elected professor of chemistry. He became also physician to the Radcliffe Infirmary. In 1786, on a vacancy at St Bartholomew's, Dr. Austin was elected physician to that hospital, and removed to London. He rapidly acquired a large private practice, but continued his chemical studies, and was the first to institute regular chemical lectures in the school of St. Bartholomew's.[1]/nIn 1790 he delivered the Goulstonian Lectures at the College of Physicians, of which he had been elected a fellow in 1787. The lectures were on the stone, and were published in 1791. The Goulstonian Lectures are printed as A Treatise on the Origin and Component Parts of the Stone in the Urinary Bladder (London, 1791). This work contains a series of experiments made according to the defective chemistry of their time and of no permanent value. Their erroneous result is \"that the stone is formed generally in very small part, and often in no degree whatever, from the urine as secreted by the kidneys, but chiefly from the mucus produced from the sides of the different cavities through which the urine passes\"; and this led the author to a melancholy conclusion as to a common form of the affection:/nThe imperfect chemistry of his time was sufficient to lead Austin to one accurate conclusion, the variety of composition of hard concretions found throughout the body; and he also points out correctly that the hard matter found in the arteries of old people is calcareous, while the white substance covering the surface of gouty joints is not so.[1]/nHe is known to have written sermons, but none of these have been printed, and his short mathematical treatise is not now to be found. Two papers (1788 and 1789) of his on 'Heavy Inflammable Air' were read before the Royal Society (Phil. Trans. lxxx. 51).[1]/nHis last remark as to lithotomy led his surgical colleague, James Earle, to write a defence of the operation, in which he states that Austin afterwards modified his gloomy views as to the treatment of stone. Earle showed his remarks to Austin shortly before the doctor's death, and is the author of the kindly memoir of Austin prefixed to Practical Observations on the Operation for the Stone, London, 1796.[1]/nDr. Austin was twice married, and left four children by Miss Margaret Alanson, his second wife,[1] as well as two children from his first marriage.[2] He died on 21 Jan. 1793 of a rapid febrile disorder.[1]/nWilliam Hayley was a close friend of Austin, and upon Austin's death, William Cowper, who was Hayley's friend, wrote a sonnet memorializing Austin.[2]", "36166684": "Mohamed Amine Sbihi (Arabic: \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0623\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0628\u064a\u062d\u064a - born 1954, Sal\u00e9) is a Moroccan politician of the Party of Progress and Socialism.
