He was educated at Oswestry High School for Boys and then at the University College of South Wales and Monmouth where he studied physics, electrical engineering, and mathematics.  His degree was interrupted between 1944 and 1947 for service in the Royal Navy as a radar officer on HMS Illustrious.  He returned to Cardiff to complete his degree (BSc in 1948) and then undertook postgraduate studies with Arthur Wilson.

He is known mainly for his fascination with Mont Blanc and his work in funding and constructing a high-altitude observatory below its summit, and for the many years of study and research work that he and his wife conducted both there, and at their base in Chamonix. The observatory and adjacent refuge that he constructed for use by mountain guides and their clients attempting the Mont Blanc summit both still bear his name today, despite being rebuilt in modern times./nHe received many awards for his scientific achievements, including France's Legion of Honour./nJoseph Vallot was born on 16 February 1854 at Lod\u00e8ve in southern France. His father was \u00c9mile Vallot and he had a cousin, Henri - both of whom Joseph collaborated professionally with in later life.[1] Vallot's family were wealthy, having made their fortunes in the dye and textile business, and this allowed him to pursue and fund his many grand scientific undertakings throughout his life. Joseph Vallot received a classical education in Paris, first at the Lyc\u00e9e Charlemagne and then the Sorbonne.[2][3] He subsequently undertook studies at the Laboratoire de Recherche des Hautes Etudes, the Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle and at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris.[3] His interests were initially mostly in botany and geology, and he wrote articles on the plants of Africa and of the Pyrenees, publishing many alpine articles after 1886 in the annals of the French Alpine Club, of which he was a member of the Paris section.[3][4] He later became the vice-president of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 botanique de France.[5]/nVallot first visited Chamonix around 1877 and became fascinated with the glaciated mountains of the Mont Blanc massif.[6] In 1880, he married the climber and speleologist, Gabrielle P\u00e9rou.[7] They had three children: two sons, Andr\u00e9 and Ren\u00e9, and a daughter, Madeleine. She became an alpinist herself; married the painter Paul-Franz Namur\u00a0[fr] and went on to gain a female record for the ascent of Mont Blanc in 1920.[2][8] Both he and his wife typically wore pith helmets in the mountains.[9]:\u200a116/nVallot's initial interests were to follow his training as a botanist. Between 1881 and 1889 he published a range of botanical articles in various journals. These included monographs on the flora around Fontainebleu; the plants found in the pavements of Paris; the plants of Corsica; the flora of Senegal as well as the vegetation of the Pyrenees. It was to compare the vegetation between the Pyrenees and the Alps that Joseph Vallot came to Chamonix. with the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9ologique de France.[10]/nFascinated by the mountains all around Chamonix, Vallot engaged guides not to only climb Mont Blanc, but also to undertake more difficult routes such as the Aiguille du Dru, even collecting alpine plants at the same time.[10] In 1886 he made two ascents of Mont Blanc, but realised that daily arduous climbs with short stops at the summit were impracticable for serious scientific investigation. At that time it was not known if it were possible for a human to survive a night at such an extreme altitude. So Vallot determined to find out for himself.[10]/nJoseph Vallot has been described as \"one of the founding fathers of scientific research on Mont Blanc\".[11] He first scaled its summit in 1881 which triggered a life-long fascination with the 4,808-metre-high (15,774\u00a0ft) mountain and its environs./nHe settled in Chamonix and, in 1887, contrived to endure three nights encamped on its summit. Using porters, he transported 250 kilograms (550\u00a0lb) of food and equipment to the summit of Mont Blanc.[12] Whilst most returned to the valley, just Vallot, two guides, plus the maker of his scientific equipment, F-M Richard, remained. They faced \"great physical strain and constant self-denial\" whilst making detailed and simultaneous scientific measurements at three different altitudes.[13]  He involved his cousin, the engineer Henri Vallot\u00a0[fr], who assisted him by taking measurements in the Chamonix valley, with a further set of automated readings being made half way up the mountain in the Grands Mulets Hut, whilst Vallot's group was encamped on Mont Blanc's ice-clad summit. After three days and nights of gruelling work, lack of appetite and terrible headaches due to the altitude - all the time taking scientific measurements - Vallot and his party returned to Chamonix where they were greeted by a deputation of flag-waving mountain guides. They received a rapturous welcome from the town's inhabitants who had decorated the town hall with flowers and erected a triumphal arch of flowers; then a brass band led them through the streets to cheering, and they were met and congratulated on their achievement by the mayor, the municipal council, the chief justice and many others.[14] In his detailed published account of their undertaking and of their return to Chamonix, Vallot commented (in French) that \"Astonished and confused by such a triumph, we begin to realise that by going to do scientific research at this altitude we have, without knowing it, achieved a mountaineering feat.\"[15]/nRecognising the impracticalities of doing scientific studies on Mont Blanc without a permanent base, Vallot subsequently engaged his cousin Henri to draw up plans to build a high-altitude observation station which he funded himself.[16] Vallot decided to construct two observatories at different altitudes. His 'Mont Blanc Observatory' was built in Chamonix itself where it served as a base station for invited scientists, whilst the 'Observatoire Vallot' was positioned on a shoulder below Mont Blanc's summit, which enabled comparison of physical measurements made in the valley with those made at high altitude.[17]/nIn the summer of 1890, and with support from the Commune, Vallot employed 110 porters to carry building materials to construct his observatory on a rocky shoulder below the summit of Mont Blanc.[18][19] It was positioned on the Rochers des Bosses at a height of 4,358 metres (14,298\u00a0ft), but was relocated eight years later to a more suitable point nearby at 4,350 metres (14,270\u00a0ft). In 1892 he also arranged for the construction of a separate cabin for climbers who had previously been accommodated in the main observatory building.[16]/nVallot acted as the observatory's director for over 30 years. He and the many scientists he invited to study there made numerous observations across many disciplines, including astronomy, botany, cartography, geology, glaciology, medicine, meteorology and physiology. The results of these researches were published between 1893 and 1917 in seven volumes of  the Annales de l'Observatoire du Mont Blanc, as well as in the Comptes Rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences.[3]/nThe first recorded case of pulmonary oedema directly attributable to the effects of high altitude (as documented by an autopsy) occurred in Vallot's observatory in 1891, with the death of a Dr. Jacottet. In 1913, Vallot became the first person to publish research demonstrating the deterioration in physical performance with increasing altitude; he used squirrels as his study animals.[3]/nCovering an area of 60 square metres, the Observatoire Vallot included a laboratory, a kitchen and an extravagantly-decorated room known as the 'Chinese Salon' which Vallot elaborately adorned with Asian items, including large tapestries, Persian rugs, a Samurai helmet and innumerable exotic ornaments. His observatory and nearby refuge attracted scientists as well as adventurers such as Achille Ratti (the future Pope Pius XI).[20]/nVallot put his knowledge and his own observatory at the disposal of the  French astronomer, Pierre Janssen when the latter initiated plans to construct his own observatory on the ice-capped summit of Mont Blanc. Because of his knowledge of glaciers and the movement of ice, Vallot strongly advised against it. The project went ahead nevertheless in 1893, but was only able to operate for a short period of time before the wooden structure began to sink into Mont Blanc's summit ice cap. It was eventually abandoned and dismantled in 1909, and the timber was used as firewood in Vallot's own observatory for many years thereafter.[9]:\u200a129\u2013130/nIn 1984, and as part of a plan to upgrade and return the observatory back into active use for high-altitude scientific research,[21]  Vallot\u2019s Chinese salon was dismantled and reassembled in the Alpine Museum in Chamonix.[22][23]/nFor some thirty years, Joseph Vallot worked alongside his cousin Henri in the latter's ambitious project to survey and create a new, detailed map of the Mont Blanc massif at a scale of 1;20000. Joseph did the high mountain survey and photography, whilst Henri surveyed at lower altitudes. Only one map was published within their lifetimes. This covered the northern slopes of Mont Blanc down to Chamonix; the remainder of the work was published by Henri's son, Charles.[16][24] Vallot received a diploma from the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Topographie de France for his contribution to his cousin's work [25]/nIn the 1890s, Vallot was the first person to make very detailed topographic measurements of the ablation zone of the Mer de Glace - the largest glacier on the Mont Blanc massif and, indeed, in France.* [1][26][27]/nIn 1899 he and his cousin, Henri Vallot, lent their formal support to a proposal to construct an underground railway tunnel from the town of Les Houches to just a few hundred metres below the summit of Mont Blanc.[28]/nJoseph Vallot's contributions to cartography and to high-altitude science (many made jointly with his wife) led to him receiving many honours and accolades over his lifetime./nIn 1895 Vallot was awarded a gold medal from the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Encouragement for his work in establishing the Mont Blanc Observatory.[2][29]/nHe was also awarded the 'grand prix des sciences physiques' and the 'prix Wilde' of the French Academy of Sciences. He was a recipient of the Legion of Honour; made a Chevalier of the Ordre des Saints-Maurice-et-Lazare\u00a0[fr], an officer of the Order of the Medjidie, and an officer of the Order of Saint-Charles of Monaco. In addition, Vallot was a corresponding member of the Bureau des Longitudes and was granted honorary presidency of the French Alpine Club.[2]/nPlaces named in his honour include Avenue Joseph Vallot and Lyc\u00e9e Joseph-Vallot in Lod\u00e8ve,[30] Rue Joseph Vallot, Chamonix,[31] Rue Joseph Vallot and Avenue Joseph Vallot, Nice.[32]/nFrom 1905 onwards, with his health deteriorating from the many long stays at high altitudes, Joseph Vallot started to spend his winter months in Nice. The climate was more favourable for him there, though he was no less active. In Nice, he built a weather station to enable him to study the region's weather, and he also continued with his botanical interests. According to the website of the Alpine Museum in Chamonix, Vallot collected some 200,000 herbarium specimens which were donated to the Nice museum.[33]/nIn 1907, Vallot, who had partnered with the cinematographer, L\u00e9on Gaumont,[34] was involved in the production of a 9.5mm film documenting the climbing of Mont Blanc.[35]/nIn September 1920, at the age of 66, Vallot made his last climb to stay and to make scientific measurements in his high-altitude observatory. From there he also made his 34th and final ascent to the summit of Mont Blanc.[36][37]/nWhen his health started to deteriorate further, Vallot left Chamonix and moved to his villa in Nice where, after a long illness, he eventually died on 11 April 1925.[38][39] His body is interred at P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. In his will, Vallot left his observatory to the French nation and it has since been utilised by the Paris Observatory, the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and, more recently, the Research Center for Alpine Ecosystems\u00a0[fr] (CREA Mont-Blanc).[17]", "31101331": "Richard Brice Hoover (born January 3, 1943) is a physicist who has authored 33 volumes and 250 papers on astrobiology, extremophiles, diatoms, solar physics, X-ray/EUV optics and meteorites.

His laboratory has also identified novel means by which different signal transduction cascades combine to distinguish between neural and non-neural cell types. They have also made critical discoveries in identifying transcription factors and signaling components that are responsible for hematopoiesis in Drosophila./nBanerjee\u2019s research focuses on the maintenance of blood stem cells, specifically hematopoietic stem cells that are maintained within a microenvironment where signals from a niche are important for the maintenance of quiescence within a precursor population. Lack of such a niche-derived signal will cause loss of \"stemness,\" resulting in increased proliferation and eventual differentiation. His research examines this phenomenon in the Drosophila hematopoietic organ using genetic technologies available in this model organism./nResults from Banerjee\u2019s lab have shown that the \"stemness\" of these cells is maintained through the combined action of a Niche Signal, that is generated by Hedgehog (Hh), a local signal generated by Wingless/Wnt and a reverse signal from the differentiated cells to the stem cells. His team has termed this combined action the Equilibrium Signal. Several important concepts underlying Drosophila blood development have allowed them to propose this system as an appropriate genetic model for vertebrate hematopoiesis, and these molecular mechanisms are being explored in the laboratory./nBanerjee\u2019s studies have led to the investigation of multiple stress response systems. Myeloid blood cells are ideal for the study of response to many kinds of stresses. Hypoxia-related factors and free radicals known as reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a role both in hematopoietic development and in stress response. Similarly, his lab has found that the NF-\u03baB derived inflammatory response plays a major role in the way blood cells respond to injury at distant sites. Banerjee\u2019s emerging view from these studies is that basic developmental mechanisms are co-opted again for stress, injury and inflammatory responses by the myeloid hematopoietic system. Genetic analysis will allow his team to understand the interrelationship between these important biological phenomena that have great relevance to diseases and disorders in humans./nBanerjee and his researchers are also interested in the study of metabolic control in cancer pathways. In the past, his lab has identified components of signal transduction pathways that participate in oncogenesis. In addition, they have examined the role of the mitochondrion in controlling cell cycle, particularly that when cells become transformed they choose alternate means of metabolism (a phenomenon referred to as the Warburg effect).

She attributed the higher rate of plant speciation in the cold and humid northeast Himalayas as compared to the cold and dry northwest Himalayas to polyploidy.[9] Also, according to her, the confluence of Chinese and Malayan elements in the flora of northeast India led to natural hybridisation between these and the native flora in this region, contributing further to plant diversification.[citation needed]/nFollowing her retirement, Janaki continued to publish the original findings of her research focusing special attention on medicinal plants and ethnobotany. In the Madras University Field Laboratory where she lived and worked she developed a garden of medicinal plants./nAs a geneticist working for the Royal Horticultural Society's Garden Wisley in the early 1950s, Dr. Janaki was investigating the effects of colchicine on a number of woody plants, including Magnolia, where a stock solution in water is made up and applied to the growing tip of young seedlings once the cotyledons (seed leaves) have fully expanded. Doubling of chromosomes occurs, giving the cells twice the usual number. The resulting plants have heavier textured leaves; their flowers are variable, often with thicker tepals, helping them last longer. As Magnolia kobus seeds were available in quantity, a number of seedlings were treated by Dr Janaki Ammal and ultimately planted on Battleston Hill at Wisley.[10]/nJanaki is mentioned among Indian Americans of the Century in an India Currents magazine article published on 1 January 2000, by S.Gopikrishna & Vandana Kumar: \"In an age when most women didn't make it past high school, would it be possible for an Indian woman to obtain a PhD at one of America's finest public universities and also make seminal contributions to her field?!\" Kerala-born Janaki was arguably the first woman to obtain a PhD in botany in the U.S. (1931) and remains one of the few Asian women to be conferred a DSc (honoris causa) by her alma mater, the University of Michigan. During her time at Ann Arbor she lived in the Martha Cook Building, an all-female residence hall and worked with Harley Harris Bartlett, a professor at the Department of Botany.[citation needed]/nShe was elected Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences in 1935, and of the Indian National Science Academy in 1957. The University of Michigan conferred an honorary LL.D. on her in 1956 in recognition of her contributions to botany and cytogenetics said: \"Blest with the ability to make painstaking and accurate observations, she and her patient endeavours stand as a model for serious and dedicated scientific workers.\" The Government of India conferred the Padma Shri on her in 1977.[11] The Ministry of Environment and Forestry of the Government of India instituted the National Award of Taxonomy in her name in 2000.[12][13]/nShe produced many hybrid brinjal varieties (the Indian name for eggplant).[14][15][16]/nTwo awards were instituted in her name in 1999: EK Janaki Ammal National Award on Plant Taxonomy and EK Janaki Ammal National Award on Animal Taxonomy.[17] A herbarium with over 25000 plant species in Jammutawi has been named after Janaki Ammal.[18] The John Innes Centre offers a scholarship to PhD students from developing countries in her name.[19]/nTo honour her work in plant breeding, the Royal Horticultural Society, Wisley, U.K.named a variety of Magnolia she created as Magnolia Kobus 'Janaki Ammal'.[20][21] In 2018, to celebrate her remarkable career and contribution to plant science, two rose breeders, Girija and Viru Viraraghavan bred a new rose variety which they named E.K.

When Japanese rule over Korea ended in 1945 Woo left his mother, his wife and his children in Japan and settled in what would become South Korea to lead the country's efforts in botany and agriculture.[2] There is a memorial museum in the port city of Busan where he lived and worked in Korea, honoring his life and accomplishments.[1]/nWoo is credited in scientific literature as Nagaharu U, a Japanese reading of the Chinese characters of his Korean name (the pronunciation of his family name \u79b9 can be Romanized as U in both Japanese (\u3046) and Korean (\uc6b0)).[3]/nWoo was born on April 8, 1898, in Akasaka, Tokyo and raised in Kure, Hiroshima, he was the first son of a Japanese mother, Sakai Naka (\uc0ac\uce74\uc774 \ub098\uce74, \u9152\u4e95\u30ca\u30ab) and a Korean father, Woo Beom-seon (\u79b9\u7bc4\u5584, \uc6b0\ubc94\uc120) of the Danyang U clan (\ubcf8\uad00: \ub2e8\uc591 \uc6b0\uc528, \u4e39\u967d \u79b9\u6c0f).[3] Woo Beom-seon served as the commander of the first battalion of the Hullyeondae (a Japanese-trained Korean military force)[4] during the late period of the Joseon dynasty and had sought political asylum in Japan.[5] He was involved in the Gaehwapa movement (a modernization faction) and was suspected of involvement in the Eulmi Incident, the assassination of Queen Min and the murder of two other women on October 13,1895. Fifty-five Japanese nationals were arrested and tried for involvement but won acquittal in a Japanese court due to lack of evidence.[6][7][2] Meanwhile, Queen Min's son, Crown Prince Yi Cheok, accused Woo Beom-seon of complicity in the murders and he fled to Japan.[8][9]/nOn November 24, 1903, Woo Beom-seon was assassinated by Go Yeong-geun (\u9ad8\u6c38\u6839, \uace0\uc601\uadfc),[2] leaving five-year-old Woo Jang-choon fatherless. His brother, Woo Hong-chun (\u79b9\u6d2a\u6625, \uc6b0\ud64d\ucd98) was born in 1904 when Jang-choon was six. Although Woo Jang-choon was part Japanese and held Japanese citizenship, his Japanese mother taught him to honor his Korean heritage.[2] She left Woo in the care of a Buddhist temple orphanage so that she could work and raise funds for his education. Food at the temple was limited to potatoes, and Woo was ostracized by other Japanese children for being part Korean, so he often stayed closed to monks and nuns. His mother returned for him after three years.[2][10] He was also a practicing Buddhist./nWoo then began his grade school education, working hard to cope with discrimination from peers.[11] Meanwhile, the Empire of Japan had begun to challenge European colonial powers in East Asia, beginning with the Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), which led almost directly to the annexation of Korea in 1910. In Japan, talented male students enlisted in the military, but Woo continued with school. To meet his financial needs, his mother sold all of their possessions, even his father's tomb, though a friend allowed the remains of Woo Beom-seon to be buried in another cemetery./nA talented math student, Woo sought to study engineering at Kyoto Imperial University, but at the suggestion of pro-Japanese Korean statesman Pak Yeong-hyo, he pursued agriculture at Tokyo Imperial University with a scholarship from the Japanese General-Government in Korea. He began his university career at Tokyo Imperial University in 1916, where he was highly regarded by his professors, and graduated in 1919. In 1936, he earned a doctorate in agriculture from the university for his dissertation \"Synthesis of Species.\"/nWoo tutored his neighbor's sons, and the neighbor introduced Woo to his sister, Watanabe Koharu (Hangul: \uc640\ud0c0\ub098\ubca0 \uace0\ud558\ub8e8, Hanja: \u6e21\u908a\u5c0f\u6625). They fell in love but had difficulty convincing Koharu's parents for permission to marry. Against her parents' wishes, however, Koharu and Woo married. Their first child was a daughter, Woo Tomoko. Their marriage produced four daughters and two sons. Kazuo Inamori is his son-in-law through his youngest daughter's marriage./nAfter Korea was liberated on August 15, 1945, Woo Jang-choon left Japan for Korea but had difficulty fitting in due to his father's actions, which burdened him for life./nWoo was soon given a position by Japan's Ministry of Agriculture. In order to further his social life, his mother trained him to be tolerant of alcohol, and Woo made many friends. By the age of 23, he had researched morning glory flowers and written a paper on the evolution and relationships between three species of Brassica, introducing the theory known as the Triangle of U, a theory which has since been confirmed by DNA studies./nWith Dr. Terao, Woo published two papers on petunia flowers. Then, Dr. Terao assigned Woo to study further on Petunia hybrida Vilm, which, among the different varieties of the species, could not be completely made into double flowers. Half of the flowers would not grow when forced into the double flower phenotype. Further work by Woo brought the complete double flowered Petunia into reality in 1930, and this earned him international prestige in the scientific community./nWoo returned to studying morning glory flowers, but his papers, nearly complete, were burnt in a fire. Then he pursued the study of genotypes and phenotypes. He was assigned to create new crucifers through combination of different phenotypes. His four years of research led to a successful interbreeding of Japanese and Korean crucifers, and another internationally renowned paper. A Doctoral degree was awarded by Tokyo University to Woo as an accolade for his excellence. A significant observation in Dr. Woo's paper was that, evolution does not happen only through the accumulation of beneficial mutations that lead to speciation, but also through exchange of genes between different species.[12][13]/nMany Japanese agricultural study graduates came under Dr. Woo to learn, but were given an overwhelming amount of exacting chores. Yet, they all continued up the ranks; Dr. Woo, however, had to stay in the Japan's Ministry of Agriculture's examination room because the Japanese policy, during the occupation of Korea, was to prevent Koreans from achieving high status. Especially, Dr. Woo had not changed his Korean name to a Japanese one -a policy aimed to assimilate Koreans into the Japanese culture. When he was promoted, it was requested that he change his name; instead, Woo resigned from his position at the Konosu examination room.[14]/nHe was hired by the Takiyi research farm, where he improved on seed-production methods and agricultural food products through artificial selection. While he concentrated on establishing a solid base for the resources needed for research, he wrote a paper on artificially combining gametophytes to improve the quality of the plants./nAround the end of the World War II, the Takiyi research farm ran a free educational program for students, and Dr. Woo was the lecturer for Korean students; as Japan began to lose the war, Koreans were forcibly drafted into the army.[15]/nOn August 15, 1945, Korea won its independence; Dr. Woo resigned from his positions at the Takiyi research farm and Tokyo University, and prepared his own place near a Buddhist temple. In Korea, farmers were left no seeds to plant because trade between Korea and Japan ceased, and the seeds were produced only in Japan. The policy was aimed to hinder Koreans from obtaining technological knowledge and to profit from selling the seeds to Koreans at a high price.[16] As a result, after the liberation, there were neither people nor companies in Korea which could produce vegetable seeds such as radish and Napa cabbage, and seeds could not be imported from Japan.[2] In accordance to a suggestion by Kim Jong-yi to resolve this problem, President Yi Seung-man sponsored a campaign to urge for Dr. Woo's return; Dr. Woo complied, and a team was established to allow Dr. Woo to work as soon as he returned to Korea. The team worked to gather money and resources, and established the \"Hanguk Nong'eop Gwahak Yeonguso\" (\ud55c\uad6d \ub18d\uc5c5 \uacfc\ud559 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc18c) or Korean Agricultural Science Research Institute near the city of Busan./nUnfortunately, as a Japanese citizen, Dr. Woo was not allowed to leave Japan for Korea. He therefore collected his papers which had traced his ancestral lineage from Korea, and went to a Japanese office which searched for illegal Korean inhabitants. The employees were shocked that a world-renowned scientist would voluntarily bring himself to the office./nIn March 1950, Dr. Woo returned to Korea. The team that was assigned to prepare for Dr. Woo's return welcomed him, holding a sign that read \"Welcome! Dr. Woo Jang-choon's return home.\" A few days later, a welcome ceremony was held in Dongrae Won'e High School, and Dr. Woo delivered a speech: \"Unfortunately, I worked for my mother's country, Japan, for fifty years. During those years, I worked for Japan no less than any other Japanese. From now on, I will work for my father's country, my home country, with all of my effort. And I will bury my bones in my home country.\"/nAfter a trip around the country, Dr. Woo observed the poor conditions of the farms, and concluded that mass production of seeds was imperative. In addition to these desperate circumstances, the Korean War began only three months after Dr. Woo's arrival in Korea. Luckily, the Busan area was able to avoid conflicts, and Dr. Woo could work uninterrupted. Because there were not many insecticides available, Woo concentrated on producing seeds that were less susceptible to bugs. He did not neglect planting flowers, which seemed to not be a concern for a country in destitute conditions. The research institute became filled with countless beautiful flowers, and many visitors came by to enjoy the scenery./nOnce, an American colonel made a visit to the institute, and saw a double-flower petunia. He quizzed an employee about the inventor of the flower. When the employee pretended to be ignorant on the subject, the colonel said that it was a Japanese scientist named Dr. Woo. To his surprise, Dr. Woo was a Korean working at the same institute, and the colonel returned with gifts to meet Dr. Woo./nFor a country not self-sufficient in producing crops to sustain and feed the country's population, the most crucial requirement was the development of top quality seeds to improve crop production. Woo Jang-choon's work resulted in improved seeds for many of Korea's staple crops, starting with Korean cabbage, the icicle radish, hot peppers, cucumbers, head cabbage, onions, tomatoes, watermelon, the yellow chamui melon. Other major horticultural breakthroughs from Woo's research included germ-resistant seed potatoes, the seedless watermelon, and the Jeju variety of tangerine (\uc81c\uc8fc\uac10\uade4)./nLater, the Korean Agricultural Science Research Institute was renamed Central Agricultural Technology Research Institute (\uc911\uc559 \uc6d0\uc608 \uae30\uc220\uc6d0)./nDr. Woo received a letter from his wife, Koharu, about his mother's poor health; he, therefore, requested the president to allow him to visit Japan, but this was not allowed. Eventually, Dr. Woo's mother died, and Dr. Woo mourned that he could not repay his mother for all she had done. This made it into the news, and there was a nationwide effort of sending letters and donations to Dr. Woo. As a memorial to his mother and to meet the needs of his employees, Dr. Woo dug a water well near his laboratory, and named it \"Jayucheon\" (\uc790\uc720\ucc9c, short for \uc790\uc560\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc5b4\uba38\ub2c8\uc758 \uc816 \uac19\uc740 \uc0d8) or \"The Well that is like the Milk of a Loving Mother\"./nMany agricultural decisions during the 1950s were made according to Dr. Woo's suggestions, or made by Dr. Woo himself. This included the planting of cosmos flowers to decorate the highways and railroads. Cosmos flowers disseminate easily, and would not be targeted by farmers to feed the livestock because they are toxic in nature. One exception was on the topic of introducing hydroponics, in which Dr. Woo suggested sanitary culture, instead, because it was a much cheaper alternative with the same result; although a hydroponics facility was installed in Suwon, the outcome was poor. The president suggested sending researchers to Japan to learn the secrets of hydroponics, but Dr. Woo said that hydroponics does not require special techniques other than clean water, the right balance of the nutrients, and time. Dr. Woo's team established a sanitary-culture facility in Seoul (the capital city of Korea), and its success was signified when the US military noted the facility's hygienic products and chose the facility to supply its soldier fruits and vegetables. Dr. Woo also succeeded in producing germ-resilient seed potatoes./nAround his 60th birthday, Woo began to have pain in his arm. He could not mediate the illness with medications and treatments, and the problem worsened. Only cortison would allow the pain to abate. But medical professor Kim Joong-hwa recommended Woo to take the medicine only when necessary, as it was not complete in its development, and negative side effects could be possible. Dr. Woo's stomach and intestines began to worsen and, although the conditions were tolerable, he was admitted to the hospital after a medical examination. Although expected to be discharged from the hospital within one month, the problems worsened, and the research employees contacted Dr. Woo's wife, Koharu, about his situation./nDr. Woo's wife, Koharu, had difficulties trying to visit Korea, but eventually succeeded in obtaining special permission from the Korean government. When she arrived, Dr. Woo promised that they would be able to live together within two to three years, and tried to look healthy./nDuring this time, the Korean government officially acknowledged Dr. Woo's achievements, and the minister of the agricultural department presented himself at the hospital, to award Dr. Woo a medal. To his wife and research employees, Dr. Woo said, \"To die I have no regret; my fatherland acknowledged me.\" On the dawn of August 10, 1959, Woo Jang-choon died in Korea. He was 61 years old.

He is considered the first to attempt to integrate genetics, development, and evolution.[1]  He pioneered understanding of reaction norms, genetic assimilation, dynamical genetics, sex determination, and heterochrony.[2] Controversially, Goldschmidt advanced a model of macroevolution through macromutations popularly known as the \"Hopeful Monster\" hypothesis.[3]/nGoldschmidt also described the nervous system of the nematode, a piece of work that influenced Sydney Brenner to study the \"wiring diagram\" of Caenorhabditis elegans,[4] winning Brenner and his colleagues the Nobel Prize in 2002./nGoldschmidt was born in Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany to upper-middle class parents of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage.[5]  He had a classical education and entered the University of Heidelberg in 1896, where he became interested in natural history.  From 1899 Goldschmidt studied anatomy and zoology at the University of Heidelberg with Otto B\u00fctschli and Carl Gegenbaur. He received his Ph.D. under B\u00fctschli in 1902, studying development of the trematode Polystomum.[2]/nIn 1903 Goldschmidt began working as an assistant to Richard Hertwig at the University of Munich, where he continued his work on nematodes and their histology, including studies of the nervous system development of Ascaris and the anatomy of Amphioxus.  He founded the histology journal Archiv f\u00fcr Zellforschung  while working in Hertwig's laboratory.  Under Hertwig's influence, he also began to take an interest in chromosome behavior and the new field of genetics.[2]/nIn 1909 Goldschmidt became professor at the University of Munich and, inspired by Wilhelm Johannsen's genetics treatise Elemente der exakten Erblichkeitslehre, began to study sex determination and other aspects of the genetics of Lymantria dispar, the gypsy moth, of which he was crossbreeding different races. He observed various stages of their sexual development, and found that some of the animals were neither male, nor female, nor hermaphrodites, but represented a whole spectrum of gynandromorphism.\u00a0He named them 'intersex', and the phenomenon accordingly 'intersexuality' (Intersexualit\u00e4t).[6] His studies of the gypsy moth, which culminated in his 1934 monograph Lymantria, became the basis for his theory of sex determination, which he worked on from 1911 until 1931.[2]  Goldschmidt left Munich in 1914 for the position as head of the genetics section of the newly founded Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Berlin.[7]/nDuring a field trip to Japan in 1914, he was unable to return to Germany due to the outbreak of the First World War, and was detained as an enemy alien in the United States. He was placed in an internment camp in Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia for \"dangerous Germans\".[8] After his release in 1918, he returned to Germany in 1919 and resumed his work at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. Sensing that it was unsafe for him to remain in Germany, he emigrated in 1936 to the United States, where he became a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. During World War II, the Nazi party published a propaganda poster entitled \"Jewish World Domination\" displaying the Goldschmidt family tree.[9]/nGoldschmidt was the first scientist to use the term \"hopeful monster\". He thought that small gradual changes could not bridge the divide between microevolution and macroevolution. In his book The Material Basis of Evolution (1940), he wrote/nthe change from species to species is not a change involving more and more additional atomistic changes, but a complete change of the primary pattern or reaction system into a new one, which afterwards may again produce intraspecific variation by micromutation./nGoldschmidt believed the large changes in evolution were caused by macromutations (large mutations). His ideas about macromutations became known as the \"hopeful monster\" hypothesis, a type of saltational evolution, and attracted widespread ridicule.[10]/nAccording to Goldschmidt, \"biologists seem inclined to think that because they have not themselves seen a 'large' mutation, such a thing cannot be possible. But such a mutation need only be an event of the most extraordinary rarity to provide the world with the important material for evolution\".[11] Goldschmidt believed that the neo-Darwinian view of gradual accumulation of small mutations was important but could account for variation only within species (microevolution) and was not a powerful enough source of evolutionary novelty to explain new species. Instead he believed that large genetic differences between species required profound \"macro-mutations\", a source for large genetic changes (macroevolution) which once in a while could occur as a \"hopeful monster\".[12][13]/nGoldschmidt is usually referred to as a \"non-Darwinian\"; however, he did not object to the general microevolutionary principles of the Darwinians. He veered from the synthetic theory only in his belief that a new species develops suddenly through discontinuous variation, or macromutation. Goldschmidt presented his hypothesis when neo-Darwinism was becoming dominant in the 1940s and 1950s, and strongly protested against the strict gradualism of neo-Darwinian theorists. His ideas were accordingly seen as highly unorthodox by most scientists and were subjected to ridicule and scorn.[14] However, there has been a recent interest in the ideas of Goldschmidt in the field of evolutionary developmental biology, as some scientists, such as G\u00fcnter Thei\u00dfen and Scott F. Gilbert, are convinced he was not entirely wrong.[15][16] Goldschmidt presented two mechanisms by which hopeful monsters might work. One mechanism, involving \"systemic mutations\", rejected the classical gene concept and is no longer considered by modern science; however, his second mechanism involved \"developmental macromutations\" in \"rate genes\" or \"controlling genes\" that change early development and thus cause large effects in the adult phenotype. These kinds of mutations are similar to those considered in contemporary evolutionary developmental biology.[17]", "19698190": "Lydia Maria DeWitt (n\u00e9e Adams; February 1, 1859 \u2013 March 10, 1928) was an American pathologist and anatomist.[1]/nLydia Maria Adams was born in Flint, Michigan to Oscar and Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Walton) Adams, the second of three children.

She became a teacher, then studied at the Michigan State Normal School (also called the Ypsilanti Normal School) and married her colleague Alton D. DeWitt in 1878.[1][2] They had two children, Stella, born in 1879, and Clyde, born in 1880. The family moved several times during this period as Alton obtained different jobs in the Michigan public school system; Lydia taught at a variety of public schools.[2]/nIn 1895, she began medical studies at the University of Michigan; she earned her Doctor of Medicine degree in 1898 and Bachelor of Science degree in 1899.[1] Lydia and Alton DeWitt separated during this time.

She was an assistant professor of pathology there until 1918, when she was elevated to associate professor.[2][A] She retired in 1926.[2]/nAs a woman scientist, DeWitt was excluded from the Faculty Research Club and the Junior Faculty Research Club at the University of Michigan. In response, she founded and headed the Women's Research Club in 1902.[2]/nDeWitt's research career covered a variety of topics and organ systems, including the pathology of tuberculosis. She studied muscles extensively, in their pathology and nervous connections, as well as the disease myositis ossificans. Other topics of her research included esophageal anatomy, membranous dysmenorrhea, and the anatomy of connections in the mammalian heart.[1]/nHer early research, at the University of Michigan, concerned the structure of nerve endings in both sensory nerves and motor nerves of striated muscle and smooth muscle. This also included studies of muscle spindles, which were published in 1897, before she finished her medical studies. Her first solo research was published in 1901 and concerned the pyloric glands and their structure in different species. While at the St. Louis Department of Health, she conducted extensive research on diphtheria and diagnosis of typhoid. Her work on isolating the islets of Langerhans cells from the pancreas and her discovery that they secreted a substance involved in carbohydrate metabolism set the stage for the discovery of insulin and its role in diabetes by a Canadian team of researchers./nAt the University of Chicago, DeWitt and her team worked on developing a drug to treat tuberculosis based on the work of Paul Ehrlich, who developed a treatment for syphilis by chemically modifying a dye that would stain parasites. Working with Hope Sherman, Gladys Leavell, and Lauretta Bender, among others, DeWitt examined several dyes as potential precursors to an anti-tuberculosis drug, including methylene blue and trypan red. This research did not bear fruit immediately, though the method was later used successfully to develop a chemotherapy for tuberculosis, and as a model for developing other drugs.[2]/nIn 1902, DeWitt joined the Association of American Anatomists.

He studied medicine in Vienna. Kirschner's studies were interrupted by service in the medical corps during World War One. Following the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Kirschner followed Professor Robert Doerr, an experimental pathologist,[11] to Amsterdam for further studies at the Koninklijk Instituut voor de Tropen (KIT), the Dutch Royal Tropical Institute.

While there, Kirschner undertook important work on the survival in the environment of the bacteria that causes leptospirosis,[2] and he and a colleague developed an effective vaccine against plague, testing early versions on themselves. Kirschner\u2019s work in Java was cut short by the Japanese invasion in 1942. He and wife Alice, a gifted violinist from Vienna, survived and provided considerable covert assistance to other prisoners using his scientific knowledge.[16]/nKirschner was recruited to the University of Otago Medical School by Dr \u2013 later Sir \u2013 Charles Hercus in 1946, to the Medical Research Council Microbiology Unit.[17] At the time of his arrival, New Zealand was considered to be free of leptospirosis, an assumption based in part on the absence of native terrestrial mammalian hosts.[18] However, Kirschner noted that many mammalian species that could serve as hosts of Leptospira spp had been introduced to New Zealand, and that measures at ports to prevent rats being imported on ships were weak.[7] Kirschner hypothesized that leptospirosis was very likely to be present and responsible for febrile illness among farmers in New Zealand. He established a leptospirosis reference laboratory at the University of Otago Medical School, confirming with Dr \u2013 later Sir \u2013 Edward G.

For more than 30 years, Gibbons performed research in medical therapeutics and diagnostic testing prior to joining Theranos in 2005. He attempted to raise issues with Theranos' management about the inaccuracy of their testing devices./nIn 2013, Gibbons intentionally overdosed on acetaminophen the night before he was scheduled to be deposed in a lawsuit related to Theranos. He was hospitalized for several days and died from liver failure. Theranos collapsed in 2018 after journalist John Carreyrou revealed in The Wall Street Journal that its supposedly revolutionary blood testing devices, requiring only a fingerstick of blood, had never functioned as claimed. Gibbons had attempted to inform his superiors at Theranos, including Holmes, of the failure of their technology but the company's executives repeatedly ignored his objections./nGibbons' career at Theranos is documented in Carreyrou's book Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup, and in the second episode of the ABC News podcast The Dropout. British actor Stephen Fry portrayed Gibbons in the biographical drama miniseries The Dropout, which is based on the podcast./nIan Gibbons was born and raised in England. His father served in the British Armed Forces, and during World War II he was held captive in North Africa, and was held in prisoner of war camps in Italy and Poland before being liberated.[7] Ian Gibbons earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Cambridge.[1][2] After obtaining his Ph.D., he moved to the United States and completed a postdoctoral fellowship in the department of molecular biology of the University of California, Berkeley.[3][8] Gibbons met his wife Rochelle while they were both studying microbiology at Berkeley in 1973, and they married in 1975.[5][9] Rochelle was educated as a scientist and patent lawyer,[10][11] and has worked in immigration law.[12]/nFor 30 years, Ian Gibbons worked on diagnostic and therapeutic products at technology companies.[13][2][14]  In the 1980s, he worked at a biotechnology firm called Syva Company, where he produced groundbreaking research on immunoassays.[15][16] During his career, Gibbons was named on almost 200 patents.[11] While working at Biotrack Laboratories, he developed blood assay technologies and held 19 patents for the scientific techniques he created.[1][2] At Biotrack, Gibbons worked with Channing Robertson, who later recommended him as the first experienced scientist to be hired by Theranos.[13][11][17] At Biotrack, Gibbons, Robertson, and others invented and patented a mechanism to dilute and mix liquid samples, abilities that would become key in Theranos' processes.[18][19][17]/nIn 2005, Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes hired Ian Gibbons as the company's chief scientist.[20][13][2] Gibbons was the first experienced scientist hired by the company,[2] with the title of Senior Director of Assay Development.[21][22] He initially served as the company's lab director and as director of product development.[23] In 2007, Gibbons was diagnosed with colon cancer.[24][11][25] He underwent cancer treatments including chemotherapy and multiple surgeries, and was absent for some time from Theranos during his recovery.[11]/nFor the company, Ian Gibbons authored 23 patents on which other Theranos researchers are also named.[26] Holmes' name appears on 19 patents related to Theranos which were authored by Gibbons.[27][28] He worked on blood chemistry with Gary Frenzel between 2005 and 2010, when Gibbons led the division.[29][30] As chief scientist, Gibbons often gave the staff informal lectures on biochemistry and the science of blood testing.[31][17] To ensure product success, Gibbons insisted blood-test results from Theranos developmental devices needed to match benchmark results of competitors' commercial analyzers.[32]/nTheranos' devices often became a source of frustration for Gibbons because they differed, sometimes significantly, from the benchmarks. His high standards became a source of disagreements with Theranos engineers and senior management. Senior management warned employees who questioned the accuracy of the technology.[13] As a result of his desperation, Gibbons told his wife Rochelle \"nothing at Theranos is working\".[33][34][35] Holmes's practice of discouraging communication between departments also troubled Gibbons.[17][36] The reason given for such information siloing was that the company was operating in stealth mode to protect its trade secrets.[13] The siloing, however, prevented effective problem solving and pursuit of common goals between employees.[36][37] Gibbons knew of Holmes's falsehoods to employees and outsiders about Theranos' technology and readiness, as well as false demonstrations to clients; and he no longer trusted Holmes. He continued, however, to struggle to make the flawed Theranos technology meet the company's expectations.[38][39] After being demoted, Gibbons diligently worked with Paul Patel, his successor at Theranos.[15] Gibbons attempted to fix the technology to match the grandiose claims made by Holmes and Theranos staff but his efforts were unsuccessful.[20][40][41] When Gibbons attempted to alert Theranos executives the technology did not work, his colleagues bullied and humiliated Gibbons for trying to speak out.[42] In 2006, Gibbons told Holmes the blood testing Theranos had developed was not yet fit for use by members of the public, and that their proprietary technology was not accurate.[43][44]/nIn late 2010, Gibbons told his friend and trusted colleague Channing Robertson about his concerns about misrepresentations made by Theranos about the effectiveness of its technology.[45] Robertson alerted Holmes of Gibbons' complaints and frustrations, and Gibbons was dismissed from the company.[5][46] Several of Gibbons' colleagues lobbied on his behalf, and he was quickly rehired with reduced responsibilities as a technical consultant to the chemistry group he had formerly headed.[13][11][42]/nIn 2011, Ian Gibbons became involved in a patent theft case involving Theranos and Richard Fuisz, an American entrepreneur and inventor who had been a former friend and neighbour of Elizabeth Holmes and her family. The two families had fallen out and Holmes had declined  Fuisz's offer to help Holmes with her invention.[47]/nAfter Fuisz studied publicly available patent information about Theranos' technology, he filed his own patent for a physician-alert mechanism that could be embedded in a testing device, which he identified was not covered by any Theranos patents. Without owning this patent, Theranos would have needed a license from Fuisz's patent to cover physician/patient alerts\u00a0\u2013 a desirable feature in a medical analyzer. When Theranos discovered Fuisz had filed his patent, it responded by filing a lawsuit for patent theft alleging Fuisz had misused Theranos' existing patent technology.[13][48]/nWhile researching his defence to the Theranos' lawsuit, Fuisz noted Gibbons was often named as co-inventor with Holmes on many of Theranos' patents. He also noted there were similarities between Gibbons' Theranos patents and those he had filed while working for a previous employer, Biotrack. In response, Fuisz added Gibbons' name to his list of witnesses to be deposed to answer questions about improper reuse of past work and the identification of Holmes as a co-inventor.[13][48]/nGibbons became nervous and depressed when he learnt he would be subpoenaed to testify.[49] He wanted to avoid being deposed because he was afraid his job depended on his testimony.[50][51] Rochelle Gibbons assessed his state of mind towards the end of his time at Theranos: \"It was hell for him to work there. It was complete hell. I think that he was very confused about why he was being treated so badly.\"[52] She said Ian felt humiliated to be associated with the company's scientific failures.[8] He felt pressured by Theranos to lie about the state of the company's research.[53] Rochelle believed if he told the truth, he would lose his job, and have limited future job prospects due to his age.[10][54] Ian felt he was in a no-win scenario; by not speaking out, he thought, he would be hurting the general populace, but if he agreed to speak the truth, he would hurt his colleagues.[55][17]/nOn May 15, 2013, Ian Gibbons was notified that he needed to appear at the Fuisz lawyers' offices on May 17 to give his deposition. A lawyer for Theranos, which had been actively discouraging him from testifying, emailed Gibbons a draft doctor's note that could be adapted to excuse him. On the evening of May 16, Gibbons ingested a combination of wine and acetaminophen.[56][2] The following morning, Rochelle Gibbons discovered him on their bathroom floor, unconscious and barely breathing. He died, aged 67, of liver failure in a hospital on May 23, 2013.[57][42] When Rochelle Gibbons called Holmes' office to report his death, Holmes did not return her call.[56][54] Gibbons' wife, however, received an email from a Theranos lawyer requesting she immediately return Gibbons' company laptop and any confidential information he might have had in his possession.[13][58] Holmes sent an internal company email to several colleagues informing them of Gibbons' death and that a memorial service would be held; no memorial service, however, was organized by Holmes or her company.[59]/nAttorneys representing Theranos sent Rochelle Gibbons a letter saying legal action against her would ensue if she spoke to a journalist about the company.[62][63][64] After she spoke with a journalist, she received a letter from the law firm representing Theranos, Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, signed by attorney Mike Brille.[13][60] The letter stated: \"It has been the Company's desire not to pursue legal action against Mrs. Gibbons. Unless she immediately ceases these actions, she will leave the Company no other option but to pursue litigation to definitively put an end [to] these actions once and for all.\"[13] In 2015, The Wall Street Journal published a Theranos expos\u00e9 by John Carreyrou, after which, Elizabeth Holmes and her partner Sunny Balwani sent text messages to each other about filing a lawsuit against Rochelle Gibbons.[61] Rochelle Gibbons said of these legal threats from Holmes' attorney David Boies and his law firm: \"[It] was absurd that is that they could think that they could sue me for talking about Ian. You know they couldn't. I guess they were trying to scare me, to intimidate me into thinking they're going to get me for defamation. But the defense, the defamation is truth and so you know I'm telling the truth here, not lying about Theranos.\"[11]/nAlthough Ian Gibbons had worked for Theranos for 10 years,[11] after his death, Rochelle Gibbons never received any condolences from the company, from Balwani, or from Holmes.[11][14][42] By 2021, Elizabeth Holmes had never contacted Rochelle Gibbons.[65][42] Gibbons publicly blamed Holmes for her husband's death,[5][6] and believed he would not have killed himself if he had not gone to work for Theranos.[66] Gibbons said Holmes \"has shown no remorse for any of the things she's done to anyone, nothing\".[5][66]/nBeginning in 2015, The Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou exposed the practices of Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes in a series of articles; this was followed by US federal government investigations that led to the company's collapse in 2018.[4][67][68] Carreyrou devoted chapter 12 of his book, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup to Ian Gibbons.[69] Carreyrou described how he met with Rochelle Gibbons, who agreed to be a source for his book, in California, two years after Ian Gibbons' death.[70][3] Carreyrou said the interview process was difficult for Gibbons; he said she was still grieving, that she blamed Theranos for his death, and that she \"wished he had never worked there\".[70]/nIan Gibbons's career, his time at Theranos, and his death were featured in the second episode of the ABC News podcast The Dropout, which was hosted by Rebecca Jarvis.[71][72] In the 2019 podcast episode titled \"The Enforcer\", Jarvis interviews Rochelle Gibbons, who had also talked with the Federal Bureau of Investigation for United States v. Elizabeth A. Holmes, et al.[71][72] In the American biographical television drama miniseries created by The Dropout, based on the podcast, Gibbons was portrayed by actor Stephen Fry.[73][74][75] In his research for the role, Fry asked show creator Elizabeth Meriwether if contacting Rochelle Gibbons would be acceptable.[71] Gibbons spoke with Fry at length about her husband, and educated Fry about his character.[71] Prior to being cast in the series, Fry had listened to the entirety of the podcast.[71] Fry viewed the Theranos scandal including Gibbons's suicide as a tragedy of \"epic Shakespearean greed\".[71]/nIan Gibbons' role in attempting to bring to light the inaccurate nature of Theranos testing machines was highlighted in a 2022 article on ethics in scientific research for the journal Science and Engineering Ethics.[30] Stanford University management professor Robert E. McGinn emphasized the roles of Theranos scientists who unsuccessfully  tried to respond admirably to the ethical challenges presented by the company's management.[30] McGinn said Gibbons' \"efforts to prevent unreasonable risks of harm were admirably ethically responsible\".[30] In a 2022 article for the journal Frontiers in Sociology, University of South Florida professors Lily M. Abadal and Garrett W. Potts[31] called the management culture at Theranos a form of \"chronic moral injury\" (CH-MI).[31] The professors concluded; \"the recent management scandal at Theranos\u00a0... perpetuated CH-MI, ultimately leading to Gibbons's untimely death\".[31]", "28086840": "Fritiof Stig Sj\u00f6strand (5 November 1912 \u2013 6 April 2011)[1] was a Swedish physician and histologist born in Stockholm. He started his medical education at Karolinska Institutet in 1933,[2] where he received his Ph.D. Karolinska Institutet in 1944.[3] Sj\u00f6strand worked as an assistant at the department of pharmacology, where he first had used polarization microscopy, he first heard about the new method of electron microscopy in 1938, within which he would become a pioneer. Manne Siegbahn at the Nobel Institute for Physics had planned to build an electron microscope in Sweden, and Sj\u00f6strand got involved in the project to explore its use in medical research. The main challenge was to produce sufficiently thin samples, and Sj\u00f6strand's method for producing ultrathin tissue samples was published in Nature in 1943.[4] However, it seemed that research based on electron microscopy would be too time-consuming for a Ph.D. thesis, so his 1944 thesis was based on fluorescence spectroscopy. In 1947-1948, he received a scholarship to further study electron microscopy at  Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Department of Biology. Back in Sweden, he received funding to build up an electron microscopy research laboratory. In 1959, Sj\u00f6strand was both offered a position as professor of histology at Karolinska Institutet, and as professor at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He chose UCLA, because conditions for research and funding were better there.[4]/nSj\u00f6strand founded the Journal of Ultrastructure Research in 1957. Since 1990, the journal has been called the Journal of Structural Biology./nSj\u00f6strand died on 6 April 2011, at the age of 98./nIn the recognition of Fritiof Sj\u00f6strand's contribution to the development of electron microscopy, the Annual Sj\u00f6strand Lecture series was set up in 2018 in Sweden.[5] A holder of the lectureship also spends time with students and postdocs at SciLifeLab. The Inaugural Lecture was given by Venki Ramakrishnan at the Karolinska Institute. The 2019 lecture was given by Jennifer Doudna.

They arrived on the Nimrod at Cape Royds in Antarctica in February\u00a01908, and set up camp in a small expedition hut that would house the 15-man party through the winter. In March, along with Douglas Mawson and Edgeworth David, Mackay made up the party who undertook the first ascent of Mount Erebus.[1]/nThe following spring when Shackelton set off to attempt to reach the South Pole, he despatched Mackay, Mawson and David northward to reach the South Magnetic Pole, which lay approximately 650 kilometres (400\u00a0mi) north-north-west of Ross Island. The trek commenced on 5\u00a0October, with the men hauling their own sleds and relaying the loads which meant that every kilometre gained by the sledges involved them travelling three kilometres (1.9\u00a0mi) by foot.[2]/nFor ten weeks, the men followed the coast north supplementing their stores with a diet of seals and penguins. They then crossed the Drygalski Ice Tongue and turned inland. They still faced a 700-kilometre (435\u00a0mi) return journey and established a depot to enable them to transfer their load to one overladen sled and to remove the need to relay. On 16\u00a0January 1909, they arrived at the South Magnetic Pole, took possession of the region for the British Crown. Mackay suggested three cheers for the King.[3]/nDavid had been appointed leader of the expedition by Shackleton, but by end January, with all three of the party experiencing severe physical deterioration, David was increasingly unable to contribute. On 31\u00a0January, with Mawson out of earshot, Mackay exerted his authority as the party's doctor and threatened to declare the professor insane unless he gave written authority of leadership to Mawson. Mawson reluctantly took command but by 30\u00a0February, he acknowledged in his diary that \"the Prof was now certainly partly demented\". That day the party reached the coast line with perfect timing as within 24\u00a0hours they were collected by the Nimrod for the return trip to Cape Royds.[4]/nThe trio had covered a distance of 1,260 miles (2,030\u00a0km), which stood as the longest unsupported sled journey until the mid-1980s./nMackay was also the ship's doctor on the ill-fated Karluk expedition in 1913 led by Vilhjalmur Stefansson to explore the regions west of Parry Archipelago for the Government of Canada. After the Karluk, captained by Robert Bartlett, was stranded, crushed, and sunk by pack ice, Mackay and three other members of the crew died of exposure while struggling across the Arctic ice to reach Wrangel Island or Herald Island.", "30642745": "Fred Brown OBE FRS (31 January 1925 \u2013 20 February 2004)[1] was a British virologist and molecular biologist./nHe was born in Clayton-le-Moors, Lancashire and lived in neighbouring Burnley, where he was educated at Burnley Grammar School and played cricket for Burnley Cricket Club.[2] He went on to study at Manchester University, where he graduated B.Sc. in chemistry in 1944 and received a Ph.D. in 1946./nHe stayed at Manchester as an assistant lecturer for two years before taking a post as a lecturer at the Bristol University Fruit and Vegetable Preservation Research Station (1948\u201350) followed by one as a senior scientific officer at the Hannah Dairy Research Institute, Ayr (1950\u201353).[3]/nA succession of other appointments followed: senior scientific officer at Christie Hospital, Manchester (1953\u201355), head of the Biochemistry Department at the Animal Virus Research Institute, Pirbright (now the Institute for Animal Health) (1955\u201383) (deputy director (1980\u201383)) and head of the Virology Department at Wellcome Biotechnology Laboratories, Beckenham {1983-90}.

He was best known for his role in the elucidation of the genetics of hereditary colorectal cancer and Lynch syndrome.[1]/nAlbert de la Chapelle was born in 1933, Helsinki, one of three sons (along with Cla\u00ebs-Henrik and Gustaf) of Cla\u00ebs Carl Fredrik Ren\u00e9 de la Chapelle (1900-1974) and Stina Serlachius (1902-1984). He spent his early childhood on his parents' apple growing estate. He attended school locally, transferring later to high school in Helsinki.[citation needed] Graduating from high school in 1950 he enrolled directly into medical school at the University of Helsinki, obtaining his MD in 1957 after a hiatus to complete 11 months of military service resulting in the rank of lieutenant. He then worked on his PhD graduating from the University of Helsinki in 1962. He was board certified in internal medicine and clinical genetics in Finland./nDe la Chapelle was married to Clara D. Bloomfield.[2]/nDe la Chapelle worked for two years in the biochemistry lab of Dr. Paul Marks at Columbia University, New York, 1966\u20131968; for a semester in the Blood Group Unit of Ruth Sanger and Rob Race at the University of London 1974, and a year in the molecular genetics lab of Dr. Jean-Claude Kaplan at the University of Paris 1981\u201382. He held Finland's first Chair in Medical Genetics at the University of Helsinki between 1974 and 1997, when he moved to Ohio State University with the aim of building a Human Cancer Genetics Program. He held a chair in Human Cancer Genetics in the program which comprises greater than 20 faculty and greater than 200 total personnel. De la Chapelle was married to Dr. Clara D. Bloomfield, an expert on leukemia./nDe la Chapelle was in clinical training in Endocrinology when a paper appeared in 1959 describing the loss of an X chromosome (45,X) in Turner's syndrome. He founded the first human cytogenetics laboratory in Finland and at first concentrated on the cytogenetics of Turner's syndrome. It turned out that in addition to 45,X, structural abnormalities of the single X chromosome were commonly involved, as well as mosaicism. Genotype/phenotype correlations were described. The resulting publication became de la Chapelle's first breakthrough publication and also his Ph.D. thesis on the cytogenetics in Turner syndrome; at that time it was the most extensive study in the field.[3]/nTargeting abnormalities affecting sex determination, de la Chapelle published the first example of a male with the karyotype 46,XX.[4] This was the first step towards the establishment of the XX male syndrome. It is now referred to by OMIM as 46,XX sex reversal 1, abbreviated SRXX1, OMIM #400045 (http://omim.org). Obviously XX males might provide valuable insight into sex determination genes and mechanisms that were unknown at the time. De la Chapelle worked with Finnish, French and US geneticists to solve the mystery of maleness without a Y. In the period between 1964 and 1990 he authored 45 peer-reviewed articles on the subject of sex determination. In the end it was detected (i) that the X and Y chromosomes share a tiny pseudoautosomal region that pairs and recombines in meiosis, (ii) that most XX males arise as a consequence of accidental unequal recombination in the paternal meiosis, transferring the male-determining region from the Y to the X). Soon after this discovery, the male determining gene SRY was cloned (by others)./nIn 1972 a rare novel recessively inherited lethal skeletal dysplasia characterized by extreme micromelia (short limbs) was described.[5] The underlying mutation, homozygosity for p.T512K in the SLC26A2 gene was later found to be responsible for the syndrome. The syndrome is called \"de la Chapelle dysplasia\" (DLCD; OMIM #256050). An alternative name is Atelosteogenesis type 2./nDe la Chapelle decided to begin to clarify the genetic basis of some 30 disorders (most recessively inherited) that were known to be greatly over-represented in the Finnish population due to its founder nature, i.e., the present population derives from a small number of settlers without significant recent influx. The diseases are said to comprise the \u201cFinnish Disease Heritage\u201d. The de la Chapelle laboratory soon was transformed into a molecular genetics one working mainly with restriction fragment length polymorphisms as markers. Prominent use of the strong linkage disequilibrium patterns was an important tool. Disease after disease was mapped to critical genomic intervals. By positional cloning the culpable genes were identified based on the occurrence of pathogenic mutations. The number of diseases studied is approximately 24, including a few \u201cnon-Finnish\u201d disorders such as Peutz\u2013Jeghers syndrome, and a few in which the de la Chapelle group mapped the region but the gene was found by others. These extensive findings were published between approximately 1987 (Choroideremia, a \u201cFinnish\u201d disorder),[6] and 2011 (MOPD1 disease in the Ohio Amish).[7]/nDr. Henry Lynch's name is attached to a condition, Lynch Syndrome (formerly Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer, HNPCC), characterized by a greatly increased risk of colorectal and endometrial cancer, plus a moderately increased risk of ~7 other cancers. In 1992 collaborations between Finnish, US, New Zealand and Canadian researchers had led to the study of 2 exceptionally large families favorable for linkage analysis. Genotyping these in Helsinki led to a breakthrough; convincing linkage was found to a locus on chromosome 2p which was subsequently shown to harbor the MSH2 gene.[8]/nThis for the first time proved that Lynch syndrome exists as a Mendelian disorder. In addition, tumors from these families were shown to display greatly reduced DNA repair, nowadays referred to and measured as microsatellite instability (MSI) or mismatch repair deficiency.[9]/nThis paper was the first of 3 early descriptions of microsatellite instability, representing a major breakthrough with translational consequences. In addition it established the link between microsatellite instability and the hereditary form of colorectal cancer. In 2015, two decades later, Dr. de la Chapelle co-authored a paper describing dramatic results of therapy with anti-PD-1 antibodies in patients with microsatellite unstable tumors.[10] The mapping of MSH2 and the detection of MSI led to an avalanche of research targeting the presumptive human homologs of already known yeast mismatch repair genes. In the end, 4 mismatch repair genes were cloned and shown to cause Lynch syndrome: MSH2 (2p), MLH1 (3p); MSH6 (2p) and PMS2 (7p). Dr. de la Chapelle's group contributed to the cloning and characterization of these genes. The unraveling of Lynch syndrome has had and will have important implications because morbidity and mortality can be substantially reduced in mutation-positive individuals through clinical surveillance and interventions. It is estimated[clarification needed] that some 30,000 new cases of LS would be detected each year in the US provided all at-risk family members of affected individuals were screened for the proband's mutation. Such screening[11] is increasingly practiced in numerous institutions and hospitals around the globe./nBeginning in 1997 a main component of de la Chapelle's research has centered on detecting and annotating gene mutations that predispose to thyroid cancer, TC. Relying on ample experience from work with the Finnish Disease Heritage (see above) the de la Chapelle laboratory has used linkage and linkage disequilibrium analysis in search of genes with high penetrance. For genes with low penetrance, genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) has been carried out. Presently some 10 high-penetrance genes and some 15 low-penetrance variants have been found and annotated. It is becoming increasingly clear that many predisposing genes of high penetrance exist, but each is rare or ultra-rare./nInstead, single nucleotide polymorphisms and other variants of low penetrance account for most of the genetically determined risk. Ongoing research in the de la Chapelle lab aims at elucidating the functional aspects of the detected genes or variants. Ultimately, when up and downstream pathways are established, this information will inform research attempting to create drugs to treat TC. Moreover, the low-penetrance variants\u2019 effects are additive, allowing the extent of genetic risk of TC to be predicted in individuals under study for TC. The de la Chapelle lab belongs to a large and active Thyroid Cancer Program at The Ohio State University. The clinical arm of the group is essential in providing crucial material for the laboratory experiments at hand. Moreover, with an active group of genetic counselors at OSU the acquisition and characterization of families with more than one member affected by TC is efficient and useful for genetic studies./nDe la Chapelle is one of the first scientists who rose to oppose the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) handling of the issue of gender verification in sports. In the 1960s there was negative publicity regarding certain athletes competing as females. Their appearance was said to be masculine and it was hypothesized that they were males masquerading as females. The IOC adopted a \u201cgender verification\u201d procedure that relied on typing female athletes for sex chromatin, a simple procedure./nIt was obvious that some women would test \u201cnegative\u201d for X chromatin even though they have no masculine traits at all. This group of women comprises individuals with the androgen insensitivity syndrome whose karyotype is 46,XY but whose anatomy is normal, and other conditions. They would \"fail\" the sex chromatin test and would not be allowed to compete as females. The IOC was unwilling to admit this mistake, which was unmasked in a landmark paper by de la Chapelle.[12] Soon other scientists joined forces and after years of public and closed door argumentation the IOC finally abandoned the sex chromatin (and later SRY gene) testing.

Starting his scientific career with pro-Lamarckian views, he shifted to selectionism and became one of the architects of the modern synthesis in evolutionary biology, which he popularised in Germany. Besides his work on how environmental factors influenced the evolution of geographically isolated populations and on evolution above the species level, which contributed to the modern synthesis, he also worked extensively in the area of animal behavior (ethology) and on philosophical aspects of biological science. His education and scientific work were interrupted by service in the German military during both World War I and World War II./nRensch was born in Thale and as a young boy, he took an interest in observing the natural world and discovered a talent for drawing and painting. He served in the German army from 1917\u20131920 and began to observe natural phenomena while he was held prisoner in France. He returned to Germany and began his studies on feather structure under Valentin Haecker (1864\u20131927) who had himself studied under August Weismann. Until the 1930s Rensch held anti-Darwinian and Lamarckian views.[1] Rensch also took an interest in the philosophy of science and was fascinated by Theodor Ziehen (1862\u20131950). Rensch also studied expressionist painting and in later life examined the biological roots of art. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Halle in 1922. He joined the zoological museum of the University of Berlin as an assistant in 1925. In 1927 he participated in a zoological expedition to the Sunda Islands.[2] He studied the geographical distribution of subspecies of polytypic species and of complexes of closely related species with attention to how local environmental factors, especially climate, influenced their evolution.[3] In 1929 he published the book Das Prinzip geographischer Rassenkreise und das Problem der Artbildung that discussed the relationship between geography and speciation. His work in this area would influence Ernst Mayr, who was also an assistant at the museum from 1927\u20131930, and would contribute to the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis.[4] In 1937 he was forced to leave the museum because he refused to join the Nazi party, and took a position at a zoological garden in M\u00fcnster.[2] In 1940 he was recalled for military service, but was discharged for medical reasons in 1942.[5][6]/nIn 1947 he published a book that would later be translated into English under the title Evolution above the species level.[7] The book discussed how the evolutionary mechanisms that drove speciation could also explain the differences between higher taxa. He introduced the concept of Artenkreis (which Mayr translated as a \"superspecies\" and defined as \"a monophyletic group of closely related and largely or entirely allopatric species\u201d). It was considered a major document in the modern synthesis. That same year he became chairman of the zoology department and director of the zoological institute at the University of M\u00fcnster. In 1953 he would take part in a zoological expedition to India. Later in his career he would work extensively in the areas of animal behavior (ethology), learning, and memory.[3] Rensch also wrote on human behaviour and he suggested that the human evolutionary connection with organisms would lead to sympathy. He published an autobiography in 1979 and remained scientifically active until his death in 1990.[2][6]/nRensche sought out universal patterns in biology.

On the contrary he shows that the roots of Lysenkoism are to be found in the messianism and determinism of Marx and Engels./nBecoming a professor at University of Paris X \u2013 Nanterre, in 1983, Denis Buican devoted most of his research on the history of Darwinism, Evolution and Genetics, he publishes many books./nA free man without illusions about Western democracies - which he did not consider to be truly democratic and readily qualified them as being only \"police- and plutocratic demagogies\" - he calls, on contrary, for an open, meritocratic society, based on the principles of power separation and reciprocal control of powers (according to Montesquieu), on the respect for the individual value and on equal opportunities. Probabilistic, he wished that the human society will enable everyone to freely and fully develop her/ his hereditary potential. Very critical in respect to the French university system - which he readily denounces as having a clan structure, attitudes and behaviors - he considers that \"a society aiming to be simultaneously equitable and efficient does require a selective - and even a micro-selective - educational system being able to offer to everyone, from cradle to the grave, the possibility to develop herself / himself without any discrimination of class or race, of religion or customs, as far as her/ his genetic heritage does allow.\" (The university as sacred mad cow of the Republic, Paris, F.-X. de Guibert, 2004, p.\u00a0127).", "50991742": "Siouxsie Wiles MNZM (born Susanna Wiles)[1] is a British microbiologist and science communicator.

She has also spoken out against anti-vaxxers and other public health related issues.[18][19]/nIn 2018, Wiles was named as a finalist for New Zealander of the Year Awards for her work on antibiotic-resistant superbugs and infectious diseases.[20] She won the award in 2021 for her leadership in the public communication of New Zealand's COVID-19 response.[21][22]/nWiles has been at the forefront of science communication in New Zealand during the COVID-19 pandemic.[23] With cartoonist Toby Morris Wiles created \"Flatten the Curve\", an animated GIF comic, for The Spinoff to describe how simple citizen actions could vastly reduce the death toll.[24] The comic went viral and was seen worldwide. Called \"the defining chart of the coronavirus\", it was based on earlier graphics by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Rosamund Pearce of The Economist, and Thomas Jefferson University professor Drew Harris.[25][26]/nIn 2020 Wiles was the subject of a documentary short entitled \"Siouxsie and the Virus\".[27]/nIn mid-September 2021, Wiles criticised the New Zealand Government's decision to abandon its COVID-19 elimination strategy, asserting that this would put the unvaccinated and vulnerable at risk.[28] During the launch of the COVID-19 Protection Framework (traffic light system) in December 2021, Wiles urged Aucklanders to put aside their summer holiday plans in order to contain the spread of the Delta variant within the community.[29]/nIn mid September 2022, Wiles criticised the Government's decision to drop the \"traffic light system\" as a \"big, long term expensive, mistake.\" She argued that the COVID-19 Protection Framework was needed to protect the country from newer COVID-19 strains, infection waves, and the problem of \"Long COVID\" among vulnerable patients. Wiles also argued that facemasks and RAT tests were still needed to curb the spread of COVID-19 within the community.[30]/nIn late July 2021, Wiles and physicist Professor Shaun Hendy wrote an open counter-letter dissenting with seven fellow University of Auckland academics (Kendall Clements, Elizabeth Rata, Doug Elliffe, Garth Cooper, Robert Nola, John Werry, and Michael Corballis), who had penned a letter in the New Zealand Listener current affairs magazine arguing that m\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori (M\u0101ori indigenous knowledge) was incompatible with science. In their response, Wiles and Hendy argued that m\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori complemented Western knowledge systems.  They also claimed that the diminishing role of indigenous knowledge in science was \"simply another tool for exclusion and exploitation\" and that mistrust in science was fuelled by scientific racism, colonialism, and injustice.[31] By 30 July, Hendry and Wiles' counter-letter had attracted more than 2,000 unverified signatures.[32]/nIn March 2022 the New Zealand Media Council upheld a complaint that a column by Wiles published by Stuff on 20 December 2021 about the Listener Seven had breached press standards. The Media Council took particular issue with Wiles' claim that the seven professors had intimidated junior colleagues with lawyers' letters was inaccurate and should not have been made.[33]/nIn January 2022 Wiles and Shaun Hendy filed claims with the Employment Relations Authority against the University of Auckland. They alleged that the University did not protect them from harassment for their COVID-19 commentary advocacy for vaccination.[34][35] Concerns were first raised in April 2020,[34] and over 60 safety concern emails had been sent in total.[36] In took until June 2022 when the university carried out a threat assessment.[35] Harassment experienced by the two were via email and social media, and included doxing and threats of physical confrontation.[34] Wiles in particular had been compared to the likes of Adolf Hitler and Satanists, and also had threats of being hanged, raped, executed, and sentenced to long jail terms.[37] After her personal details were published on a far-right social media platform, the university offered Wiles home security, Wiles said that it did not work properly, and when asked for help, the university said that the person had gone on Christmas holiday.[35] They also alleged that the university breached their academic staff collective agreement, good faith requirements, and responsive communication. The university denied any wrongdoing, and said that the Wiles and Hendy are not required or expected to provide COVID-19 commentary under their employment. Auckland University instructed to keep COVID-19 commentary to a minimum.[34] In October 2022 Hendy resolved the dispute after leaving the university.[37]/nIn August 2021, the University had advised them to reduce their public commentary and social media interaction, which Hendy and Wiles regarded as insufficient. The Employment Relations Authority also expedited their complaint, allowing it to proceed to the Employment Court, and ordered the University of Auckland to pay their legal fees.[38]/nOn 6 November 2023 a hearing started in court with an expected duration of three weeks.[39][35] That day, footage of harassment against Wiles was shown in court.[36] Such clips included conspiracy theorists Billy Te Kahika and Vinny Eastwood describing her as \"Satanic\" to their followers.[35] During cross-examination on 7 October, the University of Auckland's lawyer Philip Skelton disputed Wiles' claim that the University had silenced her by arguing that she had taken part in numerous media interviews.[40] On 7 November, a person sought to speak to Wiles at the University of Auckland. On 9 November, security staff removed a man who approached Wiles' legal team at the Employment Court, claiming he wanted to give evidence to her team. In response to these incidents, University lawyers raised concerns that media coverage of the court case could create a health and safety issue.[41]/nWiles' book Antibiotic Resistance: The End of Modern Medicine? was published in 2017 and examined the growing global problem of antibiotic resistance.[8][42] Commenting on the book, University of Otago infectious diseases expert Professor Kurt Krause described it as \"a clear call to action for New Zealanders on one of the most critical issues we face\".[42] Sarah-Jane O'Connor from the Science Media Centre writes that the book \"[\u2026]Antibiotic Resistance will provide an excellent tutorial for those who know there's cause for concern but need some extra background to understand why\".[43]/nWiles is married to Steven Galbraith, a professor of mathematics at the University of Auckland,[44] and together they have a daughter. She met her husband, a New Zealander, in London and left her position at Imperial College London to move to New Zealand in 2009.[2][4] Wiles was granted New Zealand citizenship in 2014.[45]/nShe is a fan of Lego and likes to play with it while being a critic of what she describes as gender bias in the Lego minifigures.[46] She has dyed her hair since she was a teenager, and is known as the \"pink-haired science lady\".[6] In a 2013 blog post, Wiles says that the name \"Siouxsie\" comes from singer Siouxsie Sioux, lead singer of the band Siouxsie and the Banshees.[47]/nOn 10 September 2021, Wiles attracted media attention after right-wing blogger Cameron Slater posted a video of her socialising with a friend at an Auckland beach during an Alert Level 4 lockdown in the Auckland Region in response to the August 2021 Delta variant community outbreak. Slater alleged that Wiles and her friend flouted lockdown restrictions with the story being circulated on several right-wing blogs. In response, Wiles clarified that her friend was part of the same bubble as her and that the pair had cycled 5\u00a0km from her house to the beach. She also accused Slater of spreading disinformation in order to discredit her and the country's collective response to  COVID-19.[48][49][50] National Party leader Judith Collins drew controversy when she described Wiles as a \"big, fat hypocrite\" during a virtual conversation with a Pasifika group aligned with the party.[48][50] In response to Collins' criticism of Wiles, Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield defended Wiles from allegations that she breached lockdown restrictions.[51] Wiles agreed her friend broke the Level 4 \"do not go swimming\" rule, and said she should have stopped her.[48][49][52][53]", "58593920": "\"The Platonic Permutation\" is the ninth episode of the ninth season of The Big Bang Theory.

The standard author abbreviation Berk. is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name.[1]/nBerkeley was born at Biggin Hall, Benefield, Northamptonshire, and educated at Rugby School and Christ's College, Cambridge.[2] Taking holy orders, he became incumbent of Apethorpe in 1837, and vicar of Sibbertoft, near Market Harborough, in 1868. He acquired an enthusiastic love of cryptogamic botany (lichens) in his early years, and soon was recognized as the leading British authority on fungi and plant pathology. Christ's College made him an honorary fellow in 1883.[2]/nHe was well known as a systematist in mycology with some 6000 species of fungi being credited to him, but his Introduction to Cryptogamic Botany, published in 1857, and his papers on Vegetable Pathology in the Gardener's Chronicle in 1854 and onwards, show that he had a broad grasp of the whole domain of physiology and morphology as understood in those days. Berkeley began his work as a field naturalist and collector, his earliest objects of study having been the mollusca and other branches of zoology, as testified by his papers in the Zoological Journal and the Magazine of Natural History, between 1828 and 1836.[3]/nHe was a member of the founding council of the Ray Society.[4]/nAs a microscopist he was an assiduous and accurate worker, as shown by his numerous drawings of the smaller algae and fungi, and his admirable dissections of mosses and Hepaticae. His investigations on the potato murrain, caused by Phytophthora infestans, on the grape mildew, to which he gave the name Oidium Tuckeri, and on the pathogenic fungi of wheat rust, hop mildew, and various diseases of cabbage, pears, coffee, onions, tomatoes, and other plants, were important in results bearing on the life-history of these pests, at a time when very little was known of such matters, and must always be considered in any historical account of the remarkable advances in the biology of these organisms made between 1850 and 1880.  When it is remembered that this work was done without any of the modern appliances or training of a properly equipped laboratory, the real significance of Berkeley's pioneering work becomes apparent. It has been said that/n\"... when the history of Plant Pathology is elaborated, Berkeley's name will undoubtedly stand out more prominently than that of any other individual. In fact, it is not saying too much to pronounce Berkeley as the originator and founder of Plant Pathology.\"[5]/nAs the founder of British mycology, his significant work is contained in the account of native British fungi in Sir William Jackson Hooker's British Flora (1836), in his Introduction to Cryptogamic Botany (1857), and in his Outlines of British Fungology (1860).  His herbarium at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is one of the world's most extensive, containing over 9000 specimens as well as numerous notes and sketches.[6]/nBerkeley corresponded with Anna Maria Hussey assisting her with identifying specimens while she supplied specimens she had collected to add to his herbarium.[7]/nIn 1857, Miles Joseph Berkeley was elected as member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.[8]/nIn June, 1879 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and was awarded their Royal Medal in 1863.[9]/nHe died at his vicarage, Sibbertoft, near Market Harborough, on 30 July 1889.

Their current task is developing models to mimic these cellular processes.[4]/nIn the last three decades Palmiter has become interested in the neural circuits that control innate behaviors such as eating and drinking. Palmiter and his team use mouse genetic models and viral gene transfer to study neural circuits in specific brain regions. Their goals are to visualize where relevant neurons are located and where they project their axons, to record the neurons\u2019 activity in real time, and to evaluate the behavioral and physiological consequences of activating or inhibiting those neurons. They also aim to identify downstream targets of certain neurons and discern how they are involved in responding to various threats, including pain, itch, and food poisoning.[5]/nPalmiter's valuable research has contributed greatly to the molecular biology field; therefore, he has received numerous awards and accolades as well as given lectures at notable conferences throughout his career.\u00a0His lectures include the Vern Chapman lecture in 2004 at the 18th International Mouse Genome Meeting as well as the Wallace Rowe lecture in 1999 at the American Association of Laboratory Animal Sciences 50th Annual Meeting.\u00a0In 1999 he became a Tyner Eminent Scholar at Florida State University, in 1998 he was distinguished as a Second International Fellow of the Garvan Institute in Sydney, Australia, and in 1988 he was elected to both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\u00a0His awards include the Julius Axelrod Award in Pharmacology in 2004, (the Charles-Leopold Mayer Award from the French Academy of Sciences in 1994, the Distinguished Service Award from the US Department of Agriculture in 1989, the New York Academy Award in Biological and Medical Sciences in 1983, and the George Thorn Award from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 1982.[6]/nBelow are some of Palmiter's most-cited publications:", "38212283": "Jacob Cohen is a scientist at NASA Ames Research Center.

Through this research it was his goal to identify the cause behind certain properties of the cytoskeleton including length, distribution, and the location of each type of filament and microtubule. Some specific elements Tilney has investigated is the microvilli of intestinal epithelial cells, the actin tail of Listeria, the stereocilia of hair cells in the inner ear, and the bristles of Drosophila.[3]/nTilney\u2019s research in Drosophila focused on the actin filaments. He observed the cross-linking of adjacent filaments and using forked proteins and fascin investigated how the bundles formed.[4] He observed that in mutants, the aggregation of bundles did not occur which resulted in significantly smaller bundle sizes compared to the wild type. From this, he performed experiments using and removing cross-linking agents forked proteins and fascin to investigate each cross-linkers role in properly forming actin bundles. From his work, he reached the conclusions that forked proteins are used early in the process to aggregate smaller bundles into large ones and they also help the bundles come together. Forked proteins also help fascin entry into the bundles which allows the bundles to cross-link and align properly.[5] He conducted further experiments using antibodies specific to fascin and the forked proteins to show when they were present in actin formation. From this research, he was able to identify that fascin was present predominantly during bundle elongation whereas the forked proteins were present during bundle formation and consequently played a significant role in the shape and size of the actin bundles. Further, it was demonstrated the amount of actin polymerization was also limited by the area where actin had the ability to adhere to connector material.[6]/nTilney also conducted research focused on Toxoplasma gondii and how its invasive stages acted in an actin-dependent fashion. To identify whether filaments form, Tilney induced actin polymerization on the anterior end of the parasite molecules using Jasplakinolide, an actin polymerization promoting and stabilizing molecule. Following the introduction of Jasplakinolide, it was observed that the actin-binding protein myosin connected to the newly formed polymer which confirmed its identity to be actin. This represented the first time that this actin polymerization had been observed in parasites.[7] Later research went on to show how protease inhibitors including cysteine and serine can modify the post-translational modifications in the processing of secretory proteins in the parasite.[8]/nTilney was elected into the National Academy of Sciences for cellular and developmental biology in 1998.[3] He was elected alongside three other scientists in the field of cellular biology including Michael Levine, Lelio Orci, and Joan Ruderman.

The resultant mice developed normally and their tissues were a mixture of cells derived from the two donor embryos.[5] Mintz went on to create viable chimeric embryos containing blastomeres from up to fifteen different laboratory mice.[1] She developed a technique that involved mixing cells from a black mouse strain into the blastocysts of white or brown mice in vitro. She then surgically transferred these early embryos into surrogate mothers and, after birth, traced the tissue contribution of each cell type made by studying the coat color.[6] Her cell fusion technique was successful where others had failed due to the choice to remove the zona pellucida with pronase treatment, rather than physically.

Cyber Paint was one of the first, if not the first, consumer program that enabled the user to paint across time in a compressed digital video format.  Later he developed a similar program, the Autodesk Animator for PC compatibles, where the image compression improved to the point it could play off of hard disk, and one could paint using \"inks\" that performed algorithmic transformations such as smoothing, transparency, and tiled patterns. The Autodesk Animator was used to create artwork for a wide variety of video games.[4]/nIn 2000, he wrote a program, GigAssembler,[5]  that allowed the publicly funded Human Genome Project to assemble and publish the first human genome sequence. His efforts were motivated by the research needs of himself and his colleagues, but also out of concern that the data might be made proprietary via patents by Celera Genomics.[6] In their close race with Celera, Kent and the UCSC Professor David Haussler quickly built a modest cluster of 50 commodity personal computers running a Linux-based operating system to run the software. In contrast, Celera was using what was thought then to be one of the most powerful civilian supercomputers in the world. Kent's first assembly on the human genome was released on June 22. Celera finished its assembly three days later on June 25, and the dual results were announced at the White House on June 26. On July 7, 2000, the Santa Cruz data was made publicly available on the World Wide Web while the research paper describing this publicly funded genome was published in February 2001 special issue of Nature,[7] in parallel with Celera's results in the journal Science.[8] In 2002 Tim O'Reilly described Kent's work as \"the most significant work of open source development in the past year\".  While all of Kent's genomics software is open source in the sense that the source code can be downloaded and read for free, and all of the software can be freely used for academic, nonprofit, and personal use, some of it requires a license, either from UCSC or from Kent Informatics Inc., for commercial use.[9]/nAfter GigAssembler, Kent went on to write BLAT (BLAST-like alignment tool) [10] and the UCSC Genome Browser [11] to help analyze important genome data. Kent continues to work at UCSC primarily on web tools to help understand the human genome. He helps maintain and upgrade the browser, and has worked on comparative genomics,[12] Parasol, a job control management software for the UCSC kilocluster, and the ENCODE Project.", "55808743": "Farida Hamidovna Mansurova (2 May 1952 \u2013 1 July 2021) was a Tajikistani physician and scientific researcher./nBorn in Samarkand into a medical family, Mansurova is the daughter of Hamid Mansurov and Irina Mansurova.

Haswell studied at the Edinburgh Institution and the University of Edinburgh (M.A., 1877; BSc, 1878; D.Sc., 1887) where he won seven medals, and at the conclusion of his course gained the Bell-Baxter scholarship as the most distinguished natural science student of his year.[citation needed] Amongst his teachers were Thomas Henry Huxley, Archibald Geikie and Charles Wyville Thomson. He qualified for the MA and BSc degrees in 1878, and immediately afterwards, for reasons of health, went on a voyage to Australia.[2]/nHaswell arrived in Sydney in late 1878 and soon began work in a small marine zoological laboratory at Watsons Bay. There he researched the collections from the Chevert expedition to New Guinea, and the marine fauna of Port Jackson and the adjacent coast.\nHaswell was elected a member of the Linnean Society of New South Wales in April 1879, when he had already contributed five papers to the Proceedings. He accepted a post as curator at the Queensland Museum in Brisbane, but moved back to Sydney after one year in the position. In 1881 he collected specimens along the tropical coast of Queensland as a guest on HMS Alert.[3] In 1881 Sir William Macleay arranged for him to give a course of public lectures on zoology. At the University of Sydney, he was appointed professor of biology in 1889./nHaswell was acting-curator of the Australian museum for part of 1882, and compiled a Catalogue of the Australian Stalk- and Sessile-eyed Crustacea which was published in that year. In the same year he was appointed demonstrator, and later, lecturer, in the subjects of zoology, comparative anatomy, and histology at the university of Sydney. He was much interested in the fauna of the New South Wales coast, and especially in the Crustacea, Annelida and Bryozoa, but also did other work covering a wide field. When the Challis professorship of biology was founded in 1889, Haswell was given the position and held it until its division in 1913. In 1893 he published in the Macleay Memorial Volume \"A Monograph of the Temnocephaleae\", a group which retained his interest for the remainder of his life. He collaborated with Charles Hedley and Sir Joseph Verco in investigating the continental shelf./nIn January 1898 appeared Haswell's best known publication A Text Book of Zoology (London) written in conjunction with Thomas Jeffery Parker of the University of Otago, New Zealand. Despite being over 1400 pages, the book was described by the authors as being \"strictly adapted to the needs of the beginner\". On account of Parker's death the second edition of this standard textbook, which appeared in 1910, was prepared by Haswell, as was also the edition which came out in January 1922. A fourth edition was released in 1928 and it remained a standard in Australian zoology courses for decades. He also published a Manual of Zoology in 1899 which was reprinted in 1908. In 1913 a chair of botany was created at the university of Sydney and Haswell became professor of zoology./nHaswell resigned his office at the end of 1917 and was appointed professor emeritus. He continued doing research work until shortly before his death from heart disease at Sydney on 24 January 1925. In 1894 Haswell had married Josephine Gordon, daughter of W. G. Rich, who survived him with a daughter. Haswell was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, London, in 1897. In 1915 the Royal Society of New South Wales awarded him the Clarke Medal. In addition to the works already mentioned Haswell contributed a large number of papers to scientific journals. No fewer than 74 of these were published in the Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. He was a member of the council of this society from 1881 until his death, and was its president for the years 1891\u20132 and 1892\u20133. He was also a trustee of the Australian museum for 33 years./nHaswell was shy and unassuming, with a quiet sense of humour and much appreciation of a good story. On vacation he was fond of fly-fishing and golf, but generally he was an unceasing worker, collecting himself the materials for his researches, and making his own drawings. The Text-Book of Zoology in which he had so large a share was an excellent piece of work, clearly written and concise, a remarkable piece of scholarship which in its own way could hardly have been excelled. Many generations of students in Great Britain, America and Australia, laid the foundations of their knowledge of zoology on this book. Haswell was himself a good and sound teacher, and at the time of his death, in four out of the six universities of Australia, the chair of zoology or biology was held by one of his former students./nHaswell Place, a residential street in the Canberra suburb of Chifley, is named after him.[4]/nIn 1894 Haswell married Josephine Gordon Rich at St Luke's Church in Christchurch, New Zealand.

He is known for his work at King's College London on the structure of DNA./nWilkins' work on DNA falls into two distinct phases. The first was in 1948\u20131950, when his initial studies produced the first clear X-ray images of DNA, which he presented at a conference in Naples in 1951 attended by James Watson. During the second phase, 1951\u201352, Wilkins produced clear \"B form\" \"X\" shaped images from squid sperm, images he sent to James Watson and Francis Crick, causing Watson to write \"Wilkins... has obtained extremely excellent X-ray diffraction photographs\" [of DNA].[4][5]/nIn 1953, Wilkins' group coordinator Sir John Randall instructed Raymond Gosling to hand over to Wilkins a high-quality image of \"B\" form DNA (Photo 51), which Gosling had made in 1952,[6][7] after which his supervisor Rosalind Franklin \"put it aside\"[8] as she was leaving King's College London. Wilkins showed it to Watson.[9] This image, along with the knowledge that Linus Pauling had proposed an incorrect structure of DNA, \"mobilised\"[10] Watson and Crick to restart model building. With additional information from research reports of Wilkins and Franklin, obtained via Max Perutz, Watson and Crick correctly described the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953./nWilkins continued to test, verify, and make significant corrections to the Watson\u2013Crick DNA model and to study the structure of RNA.[11] Wilkins, Crick, and Watson were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, \"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material\".[12]/nWilkins was born in Pongaroa, New Zealand, where his father, Edgar Henry Wilkins, was a medical doctor.[13] His older sister was the translator and poet Eithne Wilkins. His family had come from Dublin, where his paternal and maternal grandfathers were, respectively, Headmaster of Dublin High School and a Chief of Police. The Wilkinses moved to Birmingham, England when Maurice was 6. Later, he attended Wylde Green College and then went to King Edward's School, Birmingham from 1929 to 1934.[citation needed]/nWilkins went to St John's College, Cambridge in 1935; he studied the Natural Sciences Tripos, specialising in Physics, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1938.[14] Mark Oliphant, who was one of Wilkins' instructors at St. John's, had been appointed to the Chair of Physics at the University of Birmingham, and had appointed John Randall to his staff. Wilkins became a PhD student of Randall at the University of Birmingham. In 1945, they published four papers in the Proceedings of the Royal Society on phosphorescence and electron traps.[15][16][17][18] Wilkins received a PhD for this work in 1940.[19][20]/nDuring World War II Wilkins developed improved radar screens at Birmingham, then worked on isotope separation at the Manhattan Project at the University of California, Berkeley during the years 1944\u201345.[21]/nMeanwhile, Randall had been appointed to the Chair of Physics at the University of St Andrews. In 1945, he appointed Wilkins as Assistant Lecturer in his department at the University of St Andrews. Randall was negotiating with the Medical Research Council (MRC) to set up a laboratory to apply the experimental methods of physics to problems of biology. The combination of these disciplines as biophysics was a novel idea. The MRC told Randall that this had to be done in another university. In 1946 Randall was appointed Wheatstone Professor of Physics, in charge of the entire Physics department at King's College, London, with the funding to set up a Biophysics Unit. He brought Wilkins with him as Assistant Director of the unit. They appointed a team of scientists trained in both the physical and biological sciences. The \"management philosophy\" was to explore the use of many techniques in parallel, to find which looked promising, and then to focus on these. Wilkins, as the scientist with most diverse experience of physics and Assistant Director of the unit, had general oversight of the varied projects besides direct involvement in his personal research projects that included new types of optical microscopy.[22] King's College received funding to build completely new Physics and Engineering Departments where vaults beneath the Strand level College forecourt had been destroyed by bombs during the War. The Biophysics Unit, several more experimental physics groups and the theoretical group started to move in, during the early months of 1952. The laboratories were opened formally by Lord Cherwell on 27 June. Wilkins' article for Nature described both departments, consistent with his leadership role and prestige within the college at large.[23]/nAt King's College, Wilkins pursued, among other things, X-ray diffraction work on ram sperm and DNA that had been obtained from calf thymus by the Swiss scientist Rudolf Signer. The DNA from Signer's lab was much more intact than the DNA which had previously been isolated. Wilkins discovered that it was possible to produce thin threads from this concentrated DNA solution that contained highly ordered arrays of DNA suitable for the production of X-ray diffraction patterns.[24] Using a carefully bundled group of these DNA threads and keeping them hydrated, Wilkins and a graduate student Raymond Gosling obtained X-ray photographs of DNA that showed that the long, thin DNA molecule in the sample from Signer had a regular, crystal-like structure in these threads. Gosling later said \"When... I first saw all those discrete diffraction spots ...emerging on the film in the developing dish was a truly eureka moment....we realised that if DNA was the gene material then we had just shown that genes could crystallize![25]\" This initial X-ray diffraction work at King's College was done in May or June 1950. It was one of the X-ray diffraction photographs taken in 1950, shown at a meeting in Naples a year later, that sparked James Watson's interest in DNA[26] causing him to write \"suddenly I was excited about chemistry.....I began to wonder whether it would be possible for me to join Wilkins in working on DNA\".[27] At that time Wilkins also introduced Francis Crick to the importance of DNA. Crick advised him to work on proteins telling Wilkins \"what you ought to do is find yourself a good protein\".[28] Wilkins knew that proper experiments on the threads of purified DNA would require better X-ray equipment. Wilkins ordered a new X-ray tube and a new microcamera. He also suggested to Randall that the soon-to-be-appointed Rosalind Franklin should be reassigned from work on protein solutions to join the DNA effort.[29]/nBy the summer of 1950 Randall had arranged for a three-year research fellowship that would fund Rosalind Franklin in his laboratory. Franklin was delayed in finishing her work in Paris. Late in 1950, Randall wrote to Franklin to inform her that rather than work on protein, she should take advantage of Wilkins's preliminary work[30] and that she should do X-ray studies of DNA fibers made from Signer's samples of DNA.[31]/nEarly in 1951 Franklin finally arrived. Wilkins was away on holiday and missed an initial meeting at which Raymond Gosling stood in for him along with Alex Stokes, who, like Crick, would solve the basic mathematics that make possible a general theory of how helical structures diffract X-rays. No work had been done on DNA in the laboratory for several months; the new X-ray tube sat unused, waiting for Franklin. Franklin ended up with the DNA from Signer, Gosling became her PhD student, and she had the expectation that DNA X-ray diffraction work was her project. Wilkins returned to the laboratory expecting, on the other hand, that Franklin would be his collaborator and that they would work together on the DNA project that he had started.[31] The confusion over Franklin's and Wilkins' roles in relation to the DNA effort (which later developed into considerable tension between them) is clearly attributable to Randall. In his letter of appointment he told Franklin \"as far as the experimental X-ray effort [on DNA] is concerned, there will be at the moment only yourself and Gosling\".[32] However, Randall never informed Wilkins of his decision to give Franklin sole responsibility for the DNA effort and Wilkins only learned of the letter years after Franklin's death. He later wrote \"My opinion is very clear: that Randall was very wrong to have written to Rosalind telling her that Stokes and I wished to stop our work on DNA, without consulting us. After Raymond [Gosling] and I got a clear crystalline X-ray pattern I was very eager to continue that work\u00a0... Trying to understand 'what really happened' when a very admirable scientist [Randall] models himself on Napoleon is not easy\u00a0... [but the letter] was very damaging to her and to me\".[33]/nBy November 1951, Wilkins had evidence that DNA in cells as well as purified DNA had a helical structure.[34] Alex Stokes had solved the basic mathematics of helical diffraction theory and thought that Wilkins's X-ray diffraction data indicated a helical structure in DNA. Wilkins met with Watson and Crick and told them about his results. This information from Wilkins, along with additional information gained by Watson when he heard Franklin talk about her research during a King's College research meeting, stimulated Watson and Crick to create their first molecular model of DNA, a model with the phosphate backbones at the center. Upon viewing the model of the proposed structure, Franklin told Watson and Crick that it was wrong. Franklin based this on two observations. First, experiments by J.M. Gulland showed that the CO- and NH2 groups of the bases could not be titrated, and so were probably inaccessible. Secondly, crystallographic evidence showed that the structural units of DNA were progressively separated by the addition of water, leading to the formation of a gel and then a solution. Franklin believed that the simplest explanation of this was for the hydrophilic part of the molecule to be on the outside. Crick tried to get Wilkins to continue with additional molecular modeling efforts, but Wilkins did not take this approach.[citation needed]/nEarly in 1952, Wilkins began a series of experiments on sepia sperm which were very encouraging. \"I...got much clearer patterns than the previous year.....when I met [Sir William Lawrence] Bragg by chance I showed him the pattern [which] very clearly offered strong evidence for a helical structure for DNA....the sharp sperm patterns were very inspiring, and had the special interest that sperm were real live objects and not just purified DNA extracted by chemists from living material\". Wilkins was particularly interested in whether living samples would yield meaningful X-ray diffraction patterns \u2013 his results showed they could.[35]/nDuring 1952, Franklin also refused to participate in molecular modeling efforts and continued to work on step-by-step detailed analysis of her X-ray diffraction data (Patterson synthesis). By the spring of 1952, Franklin had received permission from Randall to ask to transfer her fellowship so that she could leave King's College and work in John Bernal's laboratory at Birkbeck College, also in London. Franklin remained at King's College until the middle of March 1953.[36]/nLinus Pauling had published a proposed but incorrect structure of DNA, making the same basic error that Watson and Crick had made a year earlier. Some of those working on DNA in the United Kingdom feared that Pauling would quickly solve the DNA structure once he recognized his error and put the backbones of the nucleotide chains on the outside of a model of DNA. After March 1952 Franklin concentrated on the X-ray data for the A-form of less hydrated DNA while Wilkins tried to work on the hydrated B-form. Wilkins was handicapped because Franklin had all of the good DNA. Wilkins got new DNA samples, but it was not as good as the original sample he had obtained in 1950 and which Franklin continued to use. Most of his new results were for biological samples like sperm cells, which also suggested a helical structure for DNA. In July 1952 Franklin reported to him and Stokes that her newest results made her doubt the helical nature of the A-form.[citation needed]/nIn early 1953 Watson visited King's College and Wilkins showed him a high quality image of the B-form X-ray diffraction pattern, now identified as photograph 51, that Franklin had produced in March 1952. Wilkins had shown this image produced by Franklin without notifying or receiving authorization from the principal investigator who produced the image. With the knowledge that Pauling was working on DNA and had submitted a model of DNA for publication, Watson and Crick mounted one more concentrated effort to deduce the structure of DNA. Through Max Perutz, his thesis supervisor, Crick gained access to a progress report from King's College that included useful information from Franklin about the features of DNA she had deduced from her X-ray diffraction data. Watson and Crick published their proposed DNA double helical structure in a paper in the journal Nature in April 1953. In this paper Watson and Crick acknowledged that they had been \"stimulated by.... the unpublished results and ideas\" of Wilkins and Franklin.[37]/nThe first Watson-Crick paper appeared in Nature on 25 April 1953. The members of the Cambridge and King's College laboratories agreed to report their interlocking work in three papers with continuous pagination in Nature.[37][38][39]/nSir Lawrence Bragg, the director of the Cavendish Laboratory, where Watson and Crick worked, gave a talk at Guy's Hospital Medical School in London on Thursday 14 May 1953 which resulted in an article by Ritchie Calder in the News Chronicle of London, on Friday 15 May 1953, entitled \"Why You Are You. Nearer Secret of Life.\" The news reached readers of The New York Times the next day; Victor K. McElheny, in researching his biography of Watson, Watson and DNA: Making a Scientific Revolution, found a clipping of a six-paragraph New York Times article written from London and dated 16 May 1953 with the headline \"Form of 'Life Unit' in Cell Is Scanned.\" The article ran in an early edition and was then pulled to make space for news deemed more important. (The New York Times subsequently ran a longer article on 12 June 1953). The Cambridge University undergraduate newspaper Varsity also ran its own short article on the discovery on Saturday 30 May 1953. Bragg's original announcement at a Solvay conference on proteins in Belgium on 8 April 1953 went unreported by the press.[citation needed]/nFollowing the initial 1953 series of publications on the double helix structure of DNA, Wilkins continued research as leader of a team that performed a range of meticulous experiments to establish the helical model as valid among different biological species, as well as in living systems, to establish the universality of the double helix structure.[24] He became deputy director of the MRC Biophysics Unit at King's in 1955, and succeeded Randall as director of the unit from 1970 to 1972.[40][41]/nWilkins was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1959[3] and an EMBO Member in 1964.[1]/nIn 1960 he was presented with the American Public Health Association's Albert Lasker Award,[42] and in 1962 he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Also in 1962 he shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Watson and Crick for the discovery of the structure of DNA.[13]/nFrom 1969 to 1991, Wilkins was the founding President of the British Society for Social Responsibility in Science.[43]/nIn 2000, King's College London opened the Franklin-Wilkins Building in honour of Dr. Franklin's and Professor Wilkins' work at the college.[44]/nThe wording on the DNA sculpture (donated by James Watson) outside Clare College's Thirkill Court, Cambridge, England is/na) on the base:/nb) on the helices:/nThe Centre for Molecular Biodiscovery at the University of Auckland, launched in 2002, was renamed the Maurice Wilkins Centre in 2006.[45]/nWilkins was married twice.  His first wife, Ruth, was an art student whom he met whilst he was at Berkeley.  Their marriage ended in divorce, and Ruth bore her son by Wilkins after their divorce.[46] Wilkins married his second wife Patricia Ann Chidgey in 1959. They had four children, Sarah, George, Emily and William.  His widow Patricia and the children from their marriage survived him.[40][41]/nIn the years before World War II, he was an anti-war activist, joining the Cambridge Scientists' Anti-War Group. He joined the Communist Party, until the invasion of Poland by the Soviet Army in September 1939.[47] Formerly classified UK security service papers reveal that Wilkins came under suspicion of leaking atomic secrets. The files, released in August 2010, indicate surveillance of Wilkins ended by 1953.[48] \"After the war I wondered what I would do, as I was very disgusted with the dropping of two bombs on civilian centres in Japan,\" he told Britain's Encounter radio program in 1999.[49]/nWilkins published his autobiography, The Third Man of the Double Helix, in 2003.[50]", "48435995": "Amy S. Gladfelter (born April 27, 1974) is an American quantitative cell biologist who is interested in understanding fundamental mechanisms of cell organization. She is a Professor of Biology and the Associate Chair for Diversity Initiatives at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she investigates cell cycle control and the septin cytoskeleton.[5] She is also affiliated with the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center and is a fellow of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA./nGladfelter studies the spatial organization of multinucleate cells, including syncitia, cells with many nuclei that share a common cytoplasm.  Her lab at UNC Chapel Hill is broadly interested in understanding why syncytia have arisen in diverse contexts within the tree of life.[6][7][8][9]\u00a0 Syncytial cells are found throughout the human body, including in bone, blood, muscle, and placental tissue, and throughout the natural world, including in fungi, algae and in many animals during their development.\u00a0Many tumors become syncytial, while certain viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, can induce cells to fuse.\u00a0\nAdditionally, Gladfelter studies the assembly of the septin cytoskeleton and how aberrant septin structure affects its function.[10][11][12][13][14][15]  Her research program uses microscopy, biophysical and genetic approaches to study cell biology./nAmy Gladfelter trained at Princeton University (AB) with Bonnie Bassler, at Duke University (Ph.D.) with Daniel Lew and at UniBasel Biozentrum (post-doc) with Peter Philippsen before starting her independent career at Dartmouth in the Biological Sciences department in 2006, where she remained until 2016./nThe two main research focuses of the Gladfelter lab are how the cytoplasm is spatially organized and how cells sense their own geometry. Her team uses a variety of model systems to study syncytia, including Ashbya gossypii, Neurospora crassa, myotubes and the syncytiotrophoblast of human placenta to study the architecture of the cytoplasm. Gladfelter is also seeking out new fungal systems derived from the marine environment that are extremophiles and show morphologic characteristics not found in more conventional model systems.[16]/nGladfelter made the discovery that the nuclei of the multinucleate fungus Ashbya gossypii, despite sharing the same cytoplasm,  progress through the cell cycle independently.[17] This has led to further work uncovering how liquid-liquid phase separation of RNAs and proteins can permit autonomy among syncytial nuclei and help to establish cell polarity. Recently, the lab has begun examining phase separation in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a focus on understanding mechanisms of viral packaging./nAnother area that Gladfelter's lab explores is how cells sense their shape.[6] Gladfelter and her lab have extensively studied the ability of a conserved family of proteins called septins, which localize to areas of the cell that change shape or are highly curved, to sense cell curvature.[18][19][20]", "1676061": "Johann Friedrich Theodor M\u00fcller (German pronunciation: [\u02c8jo\u02d0han \u02c8f\u0281i\u02d0d\u0281\u026a\u00e7 \u02c8te\u02d0odo\u02d0\u0250\u032f \u02c8m\u028fl\u0250]; 31 March 1822\u00a0\u2013 21 May 1897), better known as Fritz M\u00fcller (Brazilian Portuguese: [\u02c8f\u027eits \u02c8mile\u0281]), and also as M\u00fcller-Desterro,[1][2] was a German biologist who emigrated to southern Brazil, where he lived in and near the city of Blumenau, Santa Catarina. There he studied the natural history of the Atlantic forest and was an early advocate of Darwinism. M\u00fcllerian mimicry is named after him.[3]/nM\u00fcller was born in the village of Windischholzhausen, near Erfurt in Thuringia,  Germany, the son of a minister. M\u00fcller had what would be seen today as a normal scientific education at the universities of Berlin (earning a BSc in Botany) and Greifswald, culminating in a PhD in Biology. He subsequently decided to study medicine. As a medical student, he began to question religion and in 1846 became an atheist, joining the Free Congregations and supporting free love. Despite completing the course, he did not graduate because he refused to swear the graduation oath, which contained the phrase \"so help me God and his sacred Gospel\"./nM\u00fcller was disappointed by the failure of the Prussian Revolution in 1848, fearing implications for his life and career. As a result, he emigrated to Brazil in 1852, with his brother August and their wives, to join Hermann Blumenau's new colony in the State of Santa Catarina. In Brazil, M\u00fcller became a farmer, doctor, teacher and biologist. During this time, he studied the natural history of the sub-tropical Atlantic forest, around the Itaja\u00ed River valley./nM\u00fcller gained an official teaching post, and spent a decade teaching mathematics at a college in Desterro.[4][5] The college was taken over by the Jesuits, and M\u00fcller (though retaining his salary) returned to the Itaja\u00ed River valley. He negotiated a number of botanical activities with the provincial government and spent the next nine years doing botanical research and advising farmers. In 1876 he was appointed as a Travelling Naturalist to the National Museum in Rio de Janeiro./nIn his retirement years, M\u00fcller received many offers of support and offers of financial help. He was one of many naturalists to visit and work in South America during the nineteenth century, but was the only one to settle in Brazil for the rest of his life. A statue of M\u00fcller was erected in Blumenau in 1929.[6]/nDuring his life M\u00fcller published over 70 papers in English and Portuguese, and also in German-language periodicals. The topics covered a range of natural topics from entomology, marine biology and botany./nM\u00fcllerian mimicry is named after and discovered by him. This phenomenon concerns the resemblance between two or more unpalatable species which are protected from predators capable of learning. The protection is often a noxious chemical, perhaps gained from the larva eating a particular plant; or it may be a sting or other defence. It is an advantage for such potential prey to advertise their status in a way clearly perceptible to their predators; this is called aposematic or warning coloration. The principle is of wide application, but in M\u00fcller's case the prey were butterflies, and the predators usually birds or reptiles.[7]/nIn M\u00fcllerian mimicry, an advantage is gained when unpalatable species resemble each other, especially when the predator has a good memory for colour (as birds, for instance, do have). Thus one trial may work to dissuade a bird from several species of butterfly which all have the same warning coloration. M\u00fcller and other naturalists believed that such systems of mimicry could only come about by means of natural selection, and all of them wrote about it./nAnother of M\u00fcller's discoveries were the M\u00fcllerian bodies in the flowering plant genus Cecropia. M\u00fcller was able to show that the small bodies at the petiole-bases of Cecropia are food bodies and are used by protecting ants of the genus Azteca which inhabit the hollow stems of these fast growing trees./nMuch of M\u00fcller's botany was stimulated by the series of botanical works published by Darwin. After Darwin's Fertilisation of Orchids (1862) he spent years of work on orchids, sending observations to his brother Hermann and to Darwin. Darwin used some of this work in his second edition of 1877, and Hermann later became famous for his work on pollination. On Climbing plants (1867) M\u00fcller lent a letter to Darwin listing 40 genera of climbing plants classified by their method of climbing. The next few months saw more observations, which Darwin had translated and published as M\u00fcller's first paper in English.[8] As a botanist, Fritz M\u00fcller is denoted by the author abbreviation F.J.M\u00fcll. when citing a botanical name.[9]/nM\u00fcller became a strong supporter of Charles Darwin. He wrote F\u00fcr Darwin in 1864, arguing that  Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection was correct, and that Brazilian crustaceans and their larvae could be affected by adaptations at any growth stage. M\u00fcller sent a copy to Darwin, who had the book privately translated for his own use.[10] A later translation into English, with some additional material by M\u00fcller, was made by W.S. Dallas, and was published as Facts and Arguments for Darwin in 1869./nExtensive correspondence exists between M\u00fcller and Darwin, and M\u00fcller also corresponded with his brother Hermann M\u00fcller, Alexander Agassiz, Ernst Krause and Ernst Haeckel.", "42734366": "Yrj\u00f6 Reenp\u00e4\u00e4 (Renqvist until 1935; 18. July 1894\u00a0\u2013 18. December 1976, Helsinki, Finland) was a Finnish physiologist and philosopher and professor of physiology in University of Helsinki.

Having graduated from the high school in 1912 Yrj\u00f6 Reenp\u00e4\u00e4 started to study medicine in University of Helsinki. Very early he was involved in research work focused on physiology under the supervision of Robert Tigerstedt, the first professor of physiology in University of Helsinki. He wrote his doctoral thesis on the physiology of taste with the title \u00dcber den Geschmack in 1918. After having served in the medical staff of the Finnish Armed Forces during the war, he returned to the Department of Physiology in University of Helsinki to continue research in sensory physiology. In line with other scientists in the first half of the 20th century, he paid several visits to physiology departments in German universities establishing lifelong contacts to sensory physiologists like Max von Frey, Johannes von Kries and [Viktor von Weizs\u00e4cker] among others. After [Robert Tigerstedt]\u2019s successor his son Carl Tigerstedt\u2019s death in 1927 Reenp\u00e4\u00e4 was nominated to the chair of physiology, the position he held until his retirement in 1962./nHaving started with experimental research on sensory physiology in the fields of taste, tactile sense, muscular sense and the sense of movement, he proceeded to deal with the principal topic of general sensory physiology that of psycho-physics. Mapping the relations of measured sensation magnitudes to stimulus parameters revealed to him the structure of the phenomenal perceptual manifold and its metrics. He outlined in an axiomatic form the psycho-physical relation fitting with Kantian epistemology and with phenomenology as presented in the first half of the century by Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger among others. Applying psycho-physical methods he and his collaborators, R. M. Bergstr\u00f6m, later his successor, Alvar Wilska, and Eeva Jalavisto among others, obtained experimental evidence of the structures of perceptual manifolds in various sensory modalities.  After his retirement he extended the philosophical considerations to include the psycho-physiological issues of mind-matter relation and discussed psycho-physiological parallelism in cases relating perceptions to evoked response data particularly in audition in the studies by Wolf Dieter Keidel and his collaborators in the University of Erlangen, where Reenp\u00e4\u00e4 had a visiting professorship./nOn the bases of the studies in sensory and observational physiology Reenp\u00e4\u00e4 conceived that sensory perceptions constitute the fundamental knowledge base also to the natural sciences. According to him, concepts can be traced back to phenomenal observations in line with the [Kantian tables of judgment and categories]. Concepts arise from the noumenal contents of observations by extracting them out of their temporal frame of the act of perception, as purely timeless entities. The [psycho-physical] relation can according to Reenp\u00e4\u00e4 be regarded as an issue of simultaneous isomorphism based on conceptual correspondence rather than possessing a causal relation./nIn addition to his scientific activities Yrj\u00f6 Reenp\u00e4\u00e4 was among others the president of the Finnish Medical Society (Duodecim) in 1933-1936, president of the Nordic Society of Physiology in 1936-1939, chairman of the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters (1942-1943).

Her early work at Oxford University with Dorothy Hodgkin used X-ray crystallography to confirm the molecular structure of penicillin, which at the time was the largest molecule whose structure has been determined using that method. Later graduate work saw her study with Linus Pauling and Edwin Cohn before becoming a professor in her own right. Low's laboratory would accomplish the discovery of the pi helix, investigate the structure of insulin, and conduct research into neurotoxins./nLow was born on March 23, 1920, in Lancaster, England, to her parents, Matthew Low and Mary Jane Wharton. She attended Park School in Preston.[2][3][4] Her father Matthew Low was a fruit trader, who lived at Brook House on Inkerman St in Preston/nShe undertook her tertiary education at Somerville College, Oxford, graduating with a bachelor's degree in 1943. That same year she began work under the biochemist Dorothy Hodgkin as a research assistant for the university's department of chemical crystallography.[5] Due to Hodgkin's focus on protein crystallography, for which she was later awarded a Nobel prize, Low and her academic colleagues were engaged in researching the use of X-rays to determine the structure of crystallized proteins.[6] Low obtained Master's and doctoral degrees in chemistry from Oxford University in 1946 and 1948 respectively, before moving on to a research associate position at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). To do so, she obtained a United States passport through emigration and later full citizenship in 1956.[1]/nWhile at Caltech, she worked under Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling for a year before moving to another yearly research associate position at Harvard University working with Edwin Cohn.[1] The following year, in 1950, Harvard offered Low her first academic appointment as assistant professor of biophysical chemistry[1] at the newly created laboratory building for \"fundamental studies of the makeup of body fluids and cells\".[7] She relocated to Columbia University in 1956 as an associate professor, and was promoted to a full professorship in 1966. Low continued at Columbia until her retirement in 1990 as professor emerita of biochemistry and molecular biophysics. She still did routine academic rounds as a \"Special Lecturer\" at the university, however, up until 2013.[1][6]/nDuring Low's early work with the Hodgkin laboratory in the final years of World War II, she discovered the sulfur elemental components of penicillin that allowed for its mass production and later transformation into other antibiotic compounds. Up to that point, a pure sample of penicillin had not been successfully synthesized due to a lack of understanding of its physical structure of the compound, specifically the variation of its penam core.[6] Due to the size of the molecule, only careful examination of the X-ray results allowed for any information on the overall construction, but the two finally completed the investigation in 1945.[8] During this time, she was one of the first scientists in the United States to conduct studies of X-ray diffraction of crystalline proteins in a laboratory setting.[9] At that time, it was the largest molecule ever to have had its structure determined by crystallography.[8] Because the knowledge Low and Hodgkin obtained was of such importance and the research had been funded by the UK government, however, their work on penicillin remained classified for decades afterwards.[8]/nAt Harvard, Low turned to topics she would continue in her later positions at Columbia University: the structure and composition of insulin and structural investigations into albumin crystals.[10] Once her Columbia lab was established, Low also included research into neurotoxins on her schedule, including curare and its derivatives. The general protein studies from her lab resulted in 1952 with the discovery of the pi helix, a fundamental structural component of a significant number of proteins.[8] Her X-ray crystallography images were used in 1953 to disprove the existence of \"beta ice\" as first claimed by Russian scientist N.

At Somerville, she studied the Polish language and considered pursuing post-war aid in Poland.[5] During her three-year assistantship, her leftist ideologies created conflict with Margaret Roberts, another student of Hodgkins who would later become Baroness Thatcher and, eventually, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.[5] Her political views and affiliation with pro-world peace organizations rumored to have association with communist parties also created conflict with her standing as a U.S. citizen. Low was denied a U.S. visa until the 1950s, during which time she became a U.S. citizen.[5] In 1950, Low married Harvard historian Metchie J. E.

He was transferred to Katowice, where he worked as a medical controller of the SP units in Upper Silesia and Opole. Practically, this meant constant mobility and work in various facilities throughout the region./nIn 1954, Ptak was relocated to Bydgoszcz, where he worked as a pediatrician for two months, though he had no previous experience in direct work with patients. Then, at his own request, he was transferred to Szczecin, where he wanted to continue his education./nHe began to write requests for release from the army. In 1955, during a two-month sick leave, he worked at the Department of Microbiology at the Medical Academy in Krak\u00f3w, where he conducted research together with Jan B\u00f3br.

Integrating mathematical models with his experimental evidence, he proposed the controversial hypothesis that some vaccines can prompt evolution of more virulent pathogen strains. Recently he confirmed this hypothesis by evolving rodent malaria parasites in mice immunised with a candidate human malaria vaccine and showing virulence increased as predicted. He also developed both the theory and the proof of principle for the production of evolution-proof insecticides and provided the critical experimental evidence that animals have genetic variation in tolerance, a host defence mechanism which complements the more conventionally studied resistance.[1]/nThis article about a British scientist is a stub.

Jones' work has been highlighted in Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine's 1990 radio documentary Last Chance to See, along with its accompanying book,[7] as well as David Quammen's 1996 book The Song of the Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinctions./nJones was born in Carmarthen, Wales in 1954. During his youth he was fascinated with animals, and bred kestrels in his back yard.[8] He credits both his initial excitement and subsequent success in restoring the Mauritius kestrel to the experience gathered during this time. Speaking of his decision to pursue conservation as a career, Jones has stated:/nI have always known what I wanted to do for as long as I can remember. I wanted to work with wildlife, to visit remote areas and to contribute to the conservation of the most endangered species. But dreaming is not enough and I realised that I needed some higher qualifications.[9]/nSubsequently, he has spent his career conserving and studying species and systems and helping others to become conservation biologists./nCarl went to Queen Elizabeth I Grammar School for boys, Carmarthen.  He did his BSc at the North-East London Polytechnic.  In 1978 Jones began his master's degree at University of Wales, Swansea. Initially studying developmental strategies in owls, the opportunity to run the conservation project in Mauritius saw him change the title of his research to \"Studies on the Biology of the Critically Endangered Birds of Mauritius\"[9] From these studies he began to formulate a strategy to conserve the most endangered avifauna in his project region. After completing his MSc, he completed a PhD, also at Swansea, studying the pink pigeon (Nesoenas mayeri)./nJones started working in Mauritius in 1979, whilst working for the International Council for Bird Preservation (now known as Birdlife International). Upon arrival, Jones' focus was to run and establish the captive breeding project and to work on the conservation of the most threatened species in the wild. Carl worked on the pink pigeon and the Mauritius kestrel (Falco punctatus), which was considered the world's rarest bird.  The species had reached an all-time low in 1974 with only four known wild birds.[10] Despite the prevailing opinion that F. punctatus was doomed to extinction, he took over the recovery project that had been initiated in 1973[11] and began to implement captive breeding techniques such as \"double-clutching\", which is the removal of the first clutch of eggs (for captive rearing) which encourages the birds to lay a second clutch, thereby increasing the fecundity of breeding pairs, along with dietary supplementation for parents, fostering of captive reared young to wild pairs and hacking of captive raised birds to ensure maximum recruitment of juvenile birds. Between 1983 and 1993, 333 Mauritius kestrels had been reared, a third of these were captive bred and the remainder were derived from wild harvested eggs, most of these were returned to the wild. The Mauritius kestrel has subsequently been down-listed from Critically Endangered in the late 1970s, to Endangered in 1994 and Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List by 2000.[4]/nDuring the 1970s, the Mauritius parakeet (Psittacula echo), the only surviving parrot species endemic to Mauritius and the Mascarenes, had suffered huge losses due to competing invasive species, predation from introduced mammals and loss of native trees in which to nest. By the early 1980s there were thought to be around 10 Mauritius parakeets left, with precious little recruitment throughout the decade. Whilst speaking at a 1990 captive breeding conference, Jones told delegates that the echo parakeet had a perilously low population and would likely become extinct, not for lack of expertise, but because attempts at gaining funding for the necessary actions had been fruitless. Mike Reynolds of the Parrot Trust approached Jones after the presentation, and the resultant collaboration brought much needed funds and veterinary expertise to the assistance of the species restoration project.[12] Under Jones' guidance, nest boxes were placed in the forest, treatments to dissuade tropical nest flies from attacking the young in the nest and supplementary feeding for breeding pairs, and by 2005, 139 birds had been released. By 2015, there was a population of about 650 birds, and the species had been down-listed from Critically endangered to Endangered in 2007.[13]/nFurther species restoration work was undertaken with the pink pigeon (Nesoenas mayeri), of which the population had declined to just 10 individuals by 1990.[14] Population estimates of about 400 birds in seven subpopulations (six in the national park and one on Ile aux Aigrettes) in 2015 have resulted from Jones' leadership in the intervention, following similar methods to the Mauritius kestrel project.[15]/nJones' work in Mauritius has always been in co-operation with the Government and he has had a close involvement with the development of their protected area network and the formation of their conservation department, the National Parks and Conservation Service. The Mauritian Wildlife Foundation and the National Parks and Conservation Service have grown in parallel and work jointly on several conservation initiatives including the running of Round Island and the species restoration projects./nAs well as the many successes with bird species and helping establish Mauritius' first National Park, Jones has been instrumental in restoring the animal and plant communities on islands around Mauritius and Rodrigues that had been left denuded and barren by decades of exposure to invasive non-native mammals, such as goats, rabbits, hares, cats and rats. Recognising that the native, endemic reptiles \u2013 some of which having already become extinct \u2013 were important ecological components, as well as evolutionarily distinct animals, Jones, the late Gerald Durrell, and John Hartley (who managed overseas projects for the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust), initiated an effort to rebuild entire eco-systems, beginning with removing alien invasive species from Round Island[16]/nWork to restore nine highly degraded Mascarene off-shore islands is underway (in Mauritius: Round Island, Ile aux Aigrettes, Flat Island, Ile aux Gabrielle, Gunner's Quoin, Ile de la Passe and Ile Fouquet; in Rodrigues: Ile Cocos and Ile aux Sables). This has involved a major programme of invasive species eradication and control in partnership with the Mauritian government, including the removal of 11 exotic vertebrates and invertebrates from multiple islands./nThe jewel in the crown of this programme is Round Island, one of the world's most important and long-standing island restoration projects. For over 30 years, work to remove invasive mammals and plants has been carried out, combined with the re-establishment of native plant species, regeneration of stands of hardwood trees and the introduction of an ecological replacement keystone species to restore lost ecological functions.[17]/nA follower, since childhood, of the work of Gerald Durrell, he first visited the Jersey Zoo in 1967.

He studied there and at the military academy in St.\u00a0Petersburg. In 1864, he became a geography teacher at the military school in Warsaw./nIn 1867, Przhevalsky successfully petitioned the Russian Geographical Society to be dispatched to Irkutsk, in central Siberia. His intention was to explore the basin of the Ussuri River, a major tributary of the Amur on the Russian\u2013Chinese frontier. This was his first important expedition. It lasted two years, after which Przhevalsky published a diary of the expedition under the title, Travels in the Ussuri Region, 1867\u201369./nHis most well-known follower and student was Pyotr Kozlov, who discovered the ruins of the Tangut city Khara-Khoto in the Ejin Banner of Alxa League in western Inner Mongolia near Juyan Lake Basin./nIn the following years he made four journeys to Central Asia:/nDuring his expedition, the Dungan Revolt (1862\u201377) was raging in China.[7] The journey provided the General Staff with important intelligence on a Muslim uprising in the kingdom of Yaqub Beg in western China, and his lecture to the Russian Imperial Geographical Society was received with \"thunderous applause\" from an overflow audience. The Russian newspaper Golos Prikazchika called the journey \"one of the most daring of our time\".[8]/nThe results of these expanded journeys opened a new era for the study of Central Asian geography as well as studies of the fauna and flora of this immense region that were relatively unknown to his Western contemporaries. Among other things, he described Przewalski's horse and Przewalski's gazelle, which were both named after him. He also described what was then considered to be a wild population of Bactrian camel. In the 21st century, the Wild Bactrian camel was shown to be a separate species from the domestic Bactrian camel. Przhevalsky's writings include five major books written in Russian and two English translations: Mongolia, the Tangut Country, and the Solitudes of Northern Tibet [1] (1875) and From Kulja, Across the Tian Shan to Lob-Nor (1879). The Royal Geographical Society awarded him their Founder's Medal in 1879 for his work.[10]/nPrzhevalsky died of typhus not long before the beginning of his fifth journey, at Karakol on the shore of Issyk Kul in present-day Kyrgyzstan.

Przhevalsky's work was also continued by his young disciple Pyotr Kozlov./nThere is another place named after Przhevalsky: he had lived in a small village called Sloboda, Smolensk Oblast, Russia from 1881-7 (except the period of his travels) and he apparently loved it. The village was renamed after him in 1964 and is now called Przhevalskoye. There is a memorial complex there that includes the old and new houses of Nikolay Przhevalsky, his bust, pond, garden, birch alleys, and khatka (a lodge, watch-house).

Przhevalsky explicitly portrayed Chinese people as cowardly, dirty and lazy in his metaphor, \"the blend of a mean Moscow pilferer and a kike\", in all respects inferior to Western culture.[15][verification needed] He purportedly argued that imperial China's hold on its northern territories, in particular Xinjiang and Mongolia, was tenuous and uncertain, and Przhevalsky openly called for Russia's annexation of bits and pieces of China's territory.[16] Przhevalsky said one should explore Asia \"with a carbine in one hand, a whip in the other.\"[17]/nPrzhevalsky, as well as other contemporary explorers including Sven Hedin, Francis Younghusband, and Aurel Stein, were active players in the British\u2013Russian struggle for influence in Central Asia, the so-called Great Game.[17]/nHere you can penetrate anywhere, only not with the Gospels under your arm, but with money in your pocket, a carbine in one hand and a whip in the other. Europeans must use these to come and bear away in the name of civilisation all these dregs of the human race. A thousand of our soldiers would be enough to subdue all Asia from Lake Baykal to the Himalayas....Here the exploits of Cortez can still be repeated./nPrzhevalsky's prejudice extended to non-Chinese Asians as well, describing the Tajik Yaqub Beg in a letter as follows, \"Yakub Beg is the same shit as all feckless Asiatics. The Kashgarian empire isn't worth a kopek.\"[18][19][20] Przhevalsky also claimed Yaqub was \"Nothing more than a political impostor,\" and also disdained the Muslim subjects of Yaqub Beg in Kashgar, claiming that they \"constantly cursed their government and expressed their desire to become Russian subjects. [...] The savage Asiatic clearly understands Russian power is the guarantee for prosperity.\" These statements were made in a report in which Przhevalsky recommended that Russian troops occupy the Kashgarian emirate, but the Russian government took no action, and China recaptured Kashgar. Przhevalsky's dreams of taking land from China did not materialize.[21]/nPrzhevalsky not only disdained Chinese ethnic groups, he also viewed the eight million non-Chinese peoples of Tibet, Turkestan, and Mongolia as uncivilized, evolutionarily backwards people who needed to be freed from Chinese rule. [22]/nPrzhevalsky proposed Russia provoke rebellions of the Buddhist and Muslim peoples in these areas of China against the Chinese regime, start a war with China, and, with a small number of Russian troops, wrest control of Turkestan from China.[23]/nPrzhevalsky is known to have had a personal relationship with Tasya Nuromskaya, whom he met in Smolensk. According to one legend, during their last meeting Nuromskaya cut off her braid and gave it to him, saying that the braid would travel with him until their marriage. She died of a sunstroke while Przhevalsky was on an expedition.[24]/nAnother woman in Przhevalsky's life was a mysterious young lady whose portrait, along with a fragment of poetry, was found in Przhevalsky's album. In the poem, she asks him to stay with her and not to go to Tibet, to which he responded in his diary: \"I will never betray the ideal, to which is dedicated all of my life. As soon as I write everything necessary, I will return to the desert...where I will be much happier than in the gilded salons that can be acquired by marriage\".[24][25]/nThere is an urban legend that Joseph Stalin was an illegitimate son of Nikolay Przhevalsky.[26][27] The legend is based on the facial similarity of both men, Stalin's official birthdate controversy (claims that he was born on 6 December 1878 instead of 21 December 1879,) and that the late Stalin era saw a resurrection of interest to the personality of Przhevalsky, numerous books and monographs were published in the Soviet Union and satellite Communist countries (which was a rare occurrence in regard to the Tsarist-era scientists,) Soviet encyclopedias portrayed Przhevalsky in sharp similarity to Stalin, which was rumored that in such a discreet manner Stalin was paying a homage to his alleged biological father. M. Khachaturova, a Tbilisi resident, who happened to know an unnamed old lady, the original bearer of the secret, was considered to be a whistleblower of the myth about Stalin's mother's alleged promiscuity. Przhevalsky's diary, if it ever existed, was rumored to disappear from archives during the early days of Stalin's ascent to power as the Communist party career, especially in its highest echelon, was troublesome for the noble blood people, who claimed a hoi polloi origin. There were unsubstantiated claims that certain 1881 paycheck ledger contained brief notes on money transfer from Przhevalsky to Stalin's mother. However, Przhevalsky's visits to Georgia are not recorded, and G. Egnatashvili, a family friend of the Jughashvilis, did not recollect anything which could possibly substantiate those claims.[28] During the Stalin era any talk concerning his ancestry and childhood was a public taboo, but the ferocity, with which the legend was debunked after the Stalin's death with the entire monographs written in order to disprove the myth (up until the 2010s,) also was considered by some as a further proof of veracity of the Przhevalsky's alleged one-night-stand theory.

This effort helped save the French wine industry and for his efforts, Riley received the French Grand Gold Medal and was named a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor in 1884.[13]/nA prolific writer, artist, and visionary, Riley authored over 2,400 publications. He published two journals, The American Entomologist (1868\u201380) and Insect Life (1889\u201394) and Riley was the first to recommend for the establishment of the Office of Experiment Stations, in 1878 before the National Agricultural Congress.[10]  He received honorary degrees from Kansas State University and the University of Missouri. He was an honorary member of the Entomological Society of London and founder and first president of the Entomological Society of Washington. He and Dr. L. O. Howard, Riley's assistant in the Federal Entomological Service, were among the founders of the American Association of Economic Entomologists, which became part of Entomological Society of America in 1953. Riley was succeeded as State Entomologist of Missouri by Otto Lugger who served as an assistant in Riley's early years./nOn 20 June 1878 Riley married in St. Louis, Missouri, Emilie Conzelman, who was born and raised in that city. Her father, Gottlieb Conzelman, came from Germany and supported his family employed as a wallpaper hanger. Emilie's mother, Jorgine Augusta (n\u00e9e Gr\u00f8nbech), was Danish; she died 21 February 1861 in St. Louis, Missouri at age 39.[14] Charles and Emilie went on to have five girls and two boys. Their first, Alice was born in 1879 and Cathryn, their youngest, came in 1891. William, Mary, Harold (who died at four months), Helen and Thora were all born in the 1880s. Emilie Conzelman Riley died at Washington D.

As he was riding rapidly down a hill, the bicycle wheel struck a granite paving block dropped by a wagon. He catapulted to the pavement and fractured his skull. He was carried home on a wagon and never regained consciousness. He died at his home the same day at the age of 52, leaving his wife with six children.[19]", "69309352": "Ana Mar\u00eda Gayoso (20 August 1948 \u2013 28 December 2004) was an Argentine marine biologist, a specialist in study of marine phytoplankton,[1] best known for being the first scientist to describe phytoplankton in the Bah\u00eda Blanca Estuary,[2][3][4] and to initiate the sustained long-term oceanographic dataset in this ecosystem.

He researched into Johne's disease, a chronic intestinal infection of cattle, and also discovered that vitamin K is needed by growing leprosy bacteria.[5][6]/nThe eldest of the eleven children of Dr. William Henry Twort, Frederick Twort was born in Camberley, Surrey on 22 October 1877.[1] The three eldest sons went to Tomlinson's Modern School in Woking.[7] From 1894 Frederick studied medicine at St Thomas's Hospital, London. After qualifying in medicine (Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons, Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians) in 1900, Twort took the first paid post available, assistant to Dr. Louis Jenner, Superintendent of the Clinical Laboratory of St Thomas' Hospital. There he trained in pathological techniques. In 1902 he became assistant to the Bacteriologist of the London Hospital, Dr. William Bulloch, later F.R.S., and carried out single-handed the whole diagnostic routine of the hospital. In 1909, Twort became the superintendent of the Brown Animal Sanatory Institution, a pathology research centre, and remained there for the duration of his career. In 1919 Twort married Dorothy Nony, daughter of Frederick J. Banister, and together they had three daughters and a son./nEarly in the history of microbiology, bacteria were often differentiated testing their ability to grow on different media. Twort's first important paper[8] found some shortcomings to this method. He found that the major subgroups identified by sugar fermentation were not capable of clear-cut subdivision by tests on glucosides, nor even were they strictly separable by sugars. Twort wrote, \"It seems, therefore, probable that the separate micro-organisms in the various subgroups are not to be regarded as distinct species, but as varieties or hybrids of one or more species. If this be so, one might expect them to be constantly varying, losing old characters and gaining new ones according to the conditions under which they are grown, and it was with the object of testing this hypothesis that further series of experiments were undertaken.\" Following prolonged incubation in media that they previously failed to ferment, several species acquired fermentation powers which originally they did not enjoy. We now know that these mutant individuals able to ferment novel sugars arose in culture, and came to dominate the population. Although ignored at the time - a trend that seemed to plague his career - this work was quite prescient, and anticipated by decades the subsequent work on adaptation and mutation by bacterial chemists and microbiologists./nLeprosy was still a major concern during the early part of the 20th century. However, work on leprosy was frustrated by the inability to culture the leprosy bacillus in the laboratory. Twort suspected that the leprosy bacillus had a 'close relationship' with the tubercle bacillus, a species that was culturable. Twort wrote, \"It appeared highly probable that these two organisms would require the same chemical substances for building up their protoplasm, which could be elaborated from the ordinary media only\nby the tubercle bacillus.\"[9] Twort therefore incorporated dead tubercle bacilli in the growth medium and succeeded in culturing leprosy. The essential substance supplied by the tubercle bacillus that was missing from the medium turned out to be vitamin K. Twort's experiment is important as a demonstration of an organism growing only when supplied with a substance elaborated by another. This is the essential feature of all growth factor investigations and the basis of all studies of bacterial nutrition. However, this work, too, was ignored for several decades./nTwort also researched Johne's disease, a chronic intestinal infection of cattle. Similarly to leprosy, Johne's bacillus could not be cultivated on ordinary media. Incorporation of dead tubercle bacilli in the medium was successful. Johne's\nbacillus had been cultivated for the first time.[10] Contrary to previous efforts, Twort's work was recognized immediately.[citation needed]/nTwort and his brother, Dr. C. C. Twort, had for some years been trying to grow viruses in artificial media hoping to find a nonpathogenic virus, which might be the wild type of a pathogenic one, so more likely to grow. In 1914, Twort set out to identify the elusive (now known to be nonexistent) \"essential substance\" that would allow vaccinia virus to grow in vitro. At the time, smallpox vaccines had to be made in the skin of calves and was almost always contaminated with the bacterial genus Staphylococcus. Twort speculated the contaminating bacteria might be the source of the \"essential substance\" needed by vaccinia to survive. He plated some of the smallpox vaccines on nutrient agar slants and obtained large bacterial colonies of several colours. Upon closer examination of the colonies with a magnifying glass, he found minute glassy areas that would not grow when subcultured. He quickly realized these glassy areas were the result of the destruction of the bacterial cells and was able to pick from some of these areas and transmit this from one staphylococci colony to another./nFurther experiments showed the agent could pass through porcelain filters and it required bacteria for growth. These observations show Twort had discovered most of the essential features of bacteriophages, although Twort seemed to favor the idea that the principle was not a separate form of life, but an enzyme which is secreted by the bacteria. Twort published these results in The Lancet in 1915 and called the contagion the bacteriolytic agent.[11][12] Unfortunately, his discovery was ignored; F\u00e9lix d'Herelle discovered phages independently,[13] and Twort's work may have been lost to time, but for Jules Bordet and Andre Gratia's rediscovery of Twort's paper./nIn the middle of his work, war broke out and a grant from the Local Government Board came to an end. Further, he became interested in the Royal Army Medical Corps and\nactually left for Salonika, where he was in charge of the base laboratory, a few weeks after his phage paper was published. Supposedly after that point, Twort was inundated with routine and could no longer pursue his research. To explain why he did not continue his work on bacteriophages, Twort responded, \"it was sometime after the end of the war before I was really free again to continue the investigation, but at that time most of the additional details of the phenomenon had been published by other workers under the title of 'the bacteriophage'. So I passed on to other work.\"[14] This excuse is rather puzzling since, in 1919, bacteriophage research was still in its infancy./nFollowing the war, the recently formed Medical Research Committee (Council) supplemented Twort's salary as a university professor by an annual grant but he never was given an assistant to help with the great number of experiments he had in mind. He struggled on under difficult and depressing conditions with singlemindedness and intense interest in his work.[15]\nTwort and others wanted to use these bacteriolytic agents to cure bacterial diseases in humans and animals.  When this proved to be unsuccessful, Twort went back to expanding his original idea that the bacteriolytic agents themselves needed an addition (essential) factor of a more exceptional nature to satisfy their fundamental needs. He searched for a substance that would allow viruses to grow apart from other forms of life (i.e. a host organism) and when this was unsuccessful, he tried to prove that bacteria evolved from viruses. His prime idea was to devise conditions for the cultivation of viruses from abiotic precursors or hypothetical pre-virus forms which might exist in nature. These experiments, while failures, presaged the famous Miller-Urey experiments of the 1950s. Although he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May 1929,[16] Twort was never again to publish work of any serious import. On 19 November 1931 London University's Senate conferred on him the title of Professor of Bacteriology on the following grounds: 1. His distinguished contributions by research to the advancement of his subject. 2. His powers of exposition. 3. His eminence in his subject.[17]/nFinancial support for his research dwindled, his stipend from the MRC ended in 1936, and his laboratory was destroyed by a bomb in 1944. The University of London took this opportunity to deprive Twort of his post and research facilities. He was allowed to store the research equipment at his home in Camberley. In 1949, Penguin Books published his chapter on the Discovery of the Bacteriophage alongside a chapter on the Bacteriophage by Felix d'Herelle in the popular series Science News.[18] Twort died on 30 March 1950.", "22516665": "Natalia Rybczynski is a Canadian paleobiologist, professor and researcher./nShe is a research scientist with the Canadian Museum of Nature and holds a professorship at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario.

Singer at the University of California, San Diego. They made a seminal model for the structure of cell membranes, which they named the Fluid Mosaic Model, and published in a 12-page paper in the February 18, 1972, issue of Science.[5] It was the first model in cell biology to be based on thermodynamics properties. Earlier descriptions of the cell membrane had serious inconsistencies with observed properties of the lipid bilayer.[11] According to the Fluid Mosaic Model, in contrast to other models, the cell membrane is composed of a single lipid bilayer which is associated with two groups of proteins. Peripheral proteins are located on the surface, while integral proteins are embedded the lipid layer. The proteins are highly varied, thus, creating a mosaic pattern. Majority of the membrane is composed of phospholipids, which exhibit fluidity like oil. The phospholids are not just stationary, but are able to move, and the proteins can move in the fluid lipid layer. These properties give the membrane flexibility.[12] The model turned out to be the foundation of modern understanding of cell membrane structure and functions. Although its basic assumptions are still true, the dynamic nature has been underestimated, and more information have been incorporated with new discoveries.[6][7][8][13][14][15][16][17]/nAfter the Gulf War of 1990\u20131991, a number of war veterans suffered from similar illness, popularly dubbed Gulf War syndrome.[18] They indicated symptoms like chronic fatigue, headaches, memory loss, muscle pain, nausea, gastrointestinal problems, joint pain, lymph node pain, increased chemical sensitivities and other signs and symptoms. Nicolson became one of the leading experts in the investigation of the cause and cure of the disease.[19] Initially the US government disregarded the illnesses as the aftermath of the Gulf War, such as exposure to biological or chemical warfare. Nicolson and his wife Nancy became the main voice to raise the problem.[20] They identified the causal pathogen as Mycoplasma fermentans, which was a different strain from the natural pathogen, raising the possibility that it was man-made biological weapon.[21] They successfully treated patients with multiple courses of specific antibiotics, such as doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, clarithromycin or minocycline.[22] Nicolson's \"Written Testimony\" to the US Senate in 1998 states that: \"We consider it quite likely that many of the Desert Storm veterans suffering from the GWI signs and symptoms may have been exposed to chemical/biological toxins (exogenous or endogenous sources of these agents) containing slowly proliferating microorganisms (Mycoplasma, Brucella, Coxiella, etc.), and such infections, although not usually fatal, can produce various chronic signs and symptoms long after exposure.\"[23] While other researchers found negative results for Mycoplasma infection,[24][25] Nicolson's team found definite high prevalence of Mycoplasma infections.[26]", "33985504": "Sir Stewart Thomas Cole KCMG FRS (born 1955) is a British/French microbiologist.

He was raised in the city of Rehovot, where he resided until his death in 2021. In his early twenties, he developed an interest in the field of agriculture, and planned a future in this field, almost with no connection to science. After completing an M.Sc. in The Faculty of Agriculture at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, he began his doctorate studies in the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot. At first Aviv was interested in the study of plant biology, but he soon found himself fascinated with molecular biology. In 1970 Aviv completed his doctorate, which focused on protein synthesis, and was offered a postdoctoral fellowship at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US, Dr. Philip Leder's lab. In 1973 he returned to Israel, to the Weizmann Institute of Science, as a senior scientist and was then appointed associate professor with tenure./nIn his spare time, Aviv studied Judaism and Jewish history, especially of The Holocaust. He also collected ancient Judaica books./nDuring his work in NIH, Aviv focused on the research of molecular processes related to differentiation, and synthesis control of Globins and Immunoglobulins, under the guidance of Dr. Philip Leder. This work was published in a series of papers, some of which were of the most quoted in the field of molecular biology for decades.[1]/nAviv developed a method for the purification of messenger RNA (mRNA) which enabled research of control mechanisms of the translation of RNA to protein, and studied the role of mRNA in the differentiation of cells and tissues. In cooperation with Edward Scolnick's lab he performed research which first made it possible to synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA), a method which was later widely used in the research of gene control mechanisms.[2] After his return to Israel, he continued to study the field of mRNA differentiation and synthesis./nDuring the late 1970s, Aviv entered the field of Recombinant DNA (genetic engineering) and applied research, and produced a microorganism (E. coli) containing the gene for Bovine Growth Hormone. The patented method he developed[3]\nis used for the industrial production of growth hormone, in order to increase milk production by cows. Bovine growth hormone is in wide use in today's dairy industry./nIn 1980, Aviv initiated and started \"Biotechnology General Corp.\", the first Israeli Biotechnology company focusing on Recombinant DNA (genetic engineering), which exists to this day. The foundation of the company was encouraged by Ephraim Katzir, formerly the president of Israel, and was supported by a group of investors led by Mr. Fred Adler, one of the leading Venture Capitalists./nAfter he retired from \"Biotechnology General Ltd.\", Aviv founded \"Diatech Ltd.\" which specialized in medical diagnostic tools, and \"Pharmos Corp.\"- In which he served as chairman and CEO.

Thewissen's fieldwork has led to the discovery of key fossils that have shed light on the transition of whales from land to water, including the discovery of Ambulocetus, Pakicetus, Indohyus, and Kutchicetus. In addition to his work on fossil discoveries, Thewissen also studies modern bowhead and beluga whales in Alaska, focusing on their biology and the implications of this knowledge for management and conservation efforts. His research has been instrumental in deepening our understanding of cetacean evolution and the adaptations that allowed these mammals to transition from terrestrial to fully aquatic lifestyles./nThewissen has always been interested in paleontology and natural history. His mother said that when Thewissen was a small boy, she had to sort through his pockets before laundry time to take out the rocks and worms he collected. His father used to take him to the town of Maastricht, and they collected fossils from the Maastrichtian period. His 12th birthday present was a rock hammer, which has accompanied him on all collecting trips since. He grew up just 2 miles from Liessel, a fossil locale that yielded the first whales he ever collected.[2]/nAfter finishing Gymnasium secondary education in Deurne, he completed undergraduate degrees in biology with a minor in geology in 1981 at the University of Utrecht./nThewissen's M.S. projects involved work in three departments of the University of Utrecht. He studied a small artiodactyl from the Eocene of Pakistan in the Geology Department, the systematic position of aardvarks in the biology department, and the functional morphology of digging in the veterinary sciences./nHe then earned an MSc cum laude degree in biology from the University of Utrecht in 1984.\nHe studied for a semester at the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, before moving to the U.S. to earn a PhD in Geological Sciences at the University of Michigan, where he studied phenacodontids, a group of Paleogene ungulate mammals (condylarths) that is ubiquitous in North America (more than 6,000 fossils), but rare or absent in all other continents. The work with artiodactyls and phenacodontids brought familiarity with the terrestrial ancestors of cetaceans. At that time, paleontologists thought cetaceans were derived from another group of condylarths, mesonychians, even though molecular biologists later found evidence that cetaceans were closely related to artiodactyls.[3]/nAfter graduating from the University of Michigan, he moved to a postdoctoral position at Duke University Medical Center which is where he became interested in studying whales. Thewissen's work on pakicetids in 2001, and that of his former PhD advisor Philip Gingerich in the same year provided evidence to support a re-evaluation of all fossil evidence.[4]/nThewissen was an assistant professor at Northeast Ohio Medical University (then called Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine) from 1993 to 1999, then associate professor from 1999 to 2008./nIn 2001, he was a visiting professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology.

In addition, he worked on the following./nThewissen and Hussain discovered a partial skeleton of a new cetacean Ambulocetus in 1992, working with and a team from the Geological Survey of Pakistan in the Kala Chitta Hills of Punjab, Pakistan.[6]/nWhen this new ancestral whale appeared in the magazine Science in 1994, Stephen Jay Gould dubbed it 'as the smoking gun of whale evolution.[7][8]/nAmbulocetus was recovered from Pakistan[9](33\u00b036\u2032N 72\u00b012\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff33.6\u00b0N 72.2\u00b0E\ufeff / 33.6; 72.2, paleocoordinates 14\u00b018\u2032N 68\u00b018\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff14.3\u00b0N 68.3\u00b0E\ufeff / 14.3; 68.3)[10][11] in 1993 by Thewissen and Muhammed Arif, and was described by Thewissen, Hussain, and Mohammad Arif in 1994.[6]/nWhile has been known since the time of Charles Darwin that cetaceans had ancestors that lived on land, this was the first skeleton that included limb bones strong enough to walk on land.[12][13]/n\"I sat on the porch of a Pakistani guesthouse, puzzling over the sea lion-size skeleton that we had just dug up in the Kala Chitta Hills. I opened some of the packages containing fossil remains that I had wrapped earlier that day, and as I scraped with a dental tool, I realized that this was a whale\u2014one that could walk around on the large hind legs that we had unearthed. It was the first such whale to be seen by a human, ever.\"[14][15]/nSunil Bajpai and Thewissen collected fossils in District Kutch, State of Gujarat, India, in the desert area close to the Pakistani border. Here, they found the skeleton of a small whale called Kutchicetus minimus. The holotype of Kutchicetus consists of some skull fragments, many vertebrae, and ribs and the limb bones, although parts of fore- and hind feet were not found. A jaw fragment allowed several whale skulls and lower jaws to be from the same species.[3]/nTeeth of Pakicetus were first found and recognized as cetaceans by the American paleontologist Robert West in 1980.[16] However, the Kala Chita Hills in Pakistan is a bone bed where cetaceans and other animals were buried together, so anatomical association between different parts is lost, and West was unable to determine which skeleton bones were associated with the teeth.[17]/nThewissen excavated the site further, discovering hundreds of bones of different mammal species. Whale teeth were the most common teeth recovered, and there were no mammals of the same sizes. This allowed the researchers to identify bones of the Pakicetus skeleton in a preliminary fashion. They later tested this identification by studying the stable isotopes of the bones, which matched the stable isotopes of the teeth and not those of the teeth of other mammals.[18]/nThe Indian geologist A. Ranga Rao collected fossils in the 1960s and 1970s in Indian Kashmir, which he named Indohyus. Upon his death, his widow, Dr. Friedlinde Obergfell, gave the rocks to Thewissen to study.[19]/nDuring the extraction of the fossils, the fossil preparator accidentally broke one of the skulls. In the cracked specimen, Thewissen recognized the ear structure of the auditory bulla which had a shape which is highly distinctive, found only in the skulls of living and extinct cetaceans, including Pakicetus. This suggested that Indohyus was related to cetaceans, and this was later confirmed by formal systematic analysis.[20]/nThewissen was able to extract many skeletal bones of Indohyus, which showed that the species was similar in body shape to a modern mousedeer (also called chevrotains).[21]/nThewissen postulates that the first steps whale ancestors took toward aquatic habitats may also have involved escaping predators.[22]/nThewissen's discovery of Indohyus helped refine the connection between whales and hippos and suggested that Indohyus was closely related to hippos too.[23]/nFred Spoor, an anthropologist at University College London, said the significance of the latest find was comparable to Archaeopteryx, the first fossils to show a clear transition between dinosaurs and birds. \"For years, cetaceans were used by creationists to support their views because for a long time, the most primitive whales known had bodies that looked like modern whales, so there seemed to be this enormous gap in Evolution. But since the early 1990s, there's been a rapid succession of fossils from India and Pakistan that beautifully fill that gap,\" he said.[20]/nThewissen acquired access to a collection of embryos of the pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata). This dolphin has hind limbs as an embryo, but the limbs are lost as the embryo develops. This work formed the basis for a study of gene control in development. In addition, Thewissen's lab studied the unusual aspects of the dentition of these dolphins, namely the absence of replacement teeth, the similarity of the shape of teeth across the toothrow, and the significant number of their teeth./nTo gain access to modern whale soft tissues, Thewissen began traveling to Alaska's north slope. Working in collaboration with the Department of Wildlife Management of the North Slope Borough, Thewissen gained access to the small number of bowhead and beluga whales which are captured yearly by native Alaskans as an indigenous exemption to the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Here, Thewissen discovered that parts of the bowhead whale's brain are dedicated to smell (the olfactory bulbs), something which had never before been confirmed in any cetaceans, and which confirmed the long-held views of Inupiat Alaskans that bowheads have a sense of smell.[24]/n[25]/nThewissen's lab was instrumental in estimating the age of Arctic whales. This data is crucial to gathering data on overall population rate of increase or decrease.[26]/nSome cetaceans, such as belugas, lay down layers in their teeth, analogous to tree rings. Thewissen's lab determined that there are several sets of finer repeated layers within the large-scale layers. One of these finer sets is linked to daily processes, and indeed, the thickness of 365 of these layers matches one large-scale layer, suggesting that the large-scale layers reflect annual intervals.[27]/nBowhead whales do not have teeth, but their baleen plates grow with age and can be used to estimate age in younger whales. It was already established that one of the bones of the ear, the tympanic part of the temporal bone, grows annually by laying down a layer of bone. Thewissen's lab studied this for bowhead and determined that this bone may also be used for determining age in this species. Both dental aging and the temporal bone aging are effective methods for determining age in fossil whales.[28]/nThewissen also established that in some cases the presence of earwax in bowhead whales may be used to establish age. In some baleen whales, earwax grows in annual layers that are not expelled through the ear canal and this can be used in age estimation.[29][30]/nThewissen's current work involves counting neurons in bowhead and beluga whale brain samples, to assess brain function, in Utqia\u0121vik\u2014formerly Barrow\u2014Alaska. Though the size of the brains of sperm whales and killer whales are larger than those of any other organism, including humans,[31] a better measure of brain function is to determine how many neurons there are in the brain. Suzana Herculano-Houzel has developed a method of counting of neurons of human and other animals' brains and the relation between the cerebral cortex area and thickness and number of cortical folds. Humans and other primates pack about twice the number of neurons in a cubed inch of brain as most other mammals.[32]/nDiscovery Channel, \"Paleoworld\", 1994.\"Back to the Seas\" Paleoworld (Season 1)/nBBC, \"Walking with Beasts\", 2001 (work covered with extensive interviews).[33][34][35][36]/nNHK (Japanese National Public Television), \"The Oceans\", 1996/nDiscovery Channel, 2001 \"The Oceans\"./nDiscovery Channel (BBC produced), 2006.

These hypotheses are not supported by mainstream medical or nutritional science.[16]  He also claims to have prevented himself from suffering ordinary pain and stiffness after strenuous exercise, and after severe injury, by taking glycine supplements, and, to have accelerated the healing of sunburn, by the same means.[17] In 2010, Brind founded Natural Food Science, LLC, through which glycine supplement products Proglyta and Sweetamine are manufactured and sold.[18]/nBrind et al. (1996) conducted a meta-analysis of 23 independent epidemiologic studies of abortion and breast cancer.[19] It calculated that there was on average a relative risk of 1.3 (1.2 - 1.4) increased risk of breast cancer. The meta-analysis was criticized in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute for ignoring the role of response bias and for a \"blurring of association with causation.\"[20] It was also criticized for selection bias by using studies with widely varying results, using different types of studies and not working with the raw data from several studies, and including studies that have methodological weaknesses.[21][22]  The statistician who collaborated with Brind later stated of their findings: \"I have some doubts. I don't think the issue has been resolved. When we were talking about the conclusions, he [Brind] wanted to make the strongest statements. I tried to temper them a little bit, but Dr. Brind is very adamant about his opinion.\"[7]/nExperts believe Brind overlooks the methodological weaknesses of some studies he uses as evidence for an abortion-breast cancer link. Furthermore, medical researchers note Brind overstates his findings since his own research shows a \"barely statistically significant\" increase in breast cancer rates.[22] In reaction to the criticism, an editor of the journal that published Brind's study noted, with concern:/nHowever, in the light of recent unease about appropriate but open communication of risks associated with oral contraceptive pills, it will surely be agreed that open discussion of risks\nis vital and must include the people \u2013 in this case the women \u2013 concerned.

As the intentionally provocative title implies, King and Jukes suggested that for most molecular evolution, genetic drift rather than natural selection is the main factor.  King himself was \"a staunch but progressive Darwinian\", but he enjoyed the strong reactions the paper provoked.[3]  This marked the beginning of the controversy over neutral evolution and the \"neutralist-selectionist debate\", primarily between organismal and molecular biologists, which would continue throughout King's career.

Filice was a professor of biology at the University of San Francisco (1947\u20131976),[1] founder of United for Life of San Francisco (1968), co-founder of the St. Ignatius Institute (1976), co-founder of Priests for Life (1991), and founder of the Holy Family Oratory of St. Philip Neri./nFilice's father, the elder Francesco Filice, descended, on his father's side, from a tribe of shepherds in what is now the Calabria province of Southern Italy.  Filice theorizes that his father's family  were Jews who took refuge in Southern Italy after the fall of Jerusalem in A.D. 70./nFilice's grandmothers were Rafaella Fortino and Nicolina Pascuzzi, both of whose families descended from the mountain peoples of Celtic descent in Southern Italy.  These tribes descend from the Boii, a Celtic people that specialized in cattle raising and filled up the Apennines in Roman times./nThe name \"Filice\" is theorized to be either a form of the word for \"fern\" in the Southern Italian dialect (in which case, the accent should be on the first 'i') or a corruption of the Latin word for \"happy\", which is \"felix\".  Both Filice and Joseph G. Fucilla, in his book Our Italian Surnames, support the latter theory. In later years, Fr. Filice would tell his friends that his name meant, \"pure Easter joy.\"[2]/nThe Filice Family, into which Fr. Filice would be born, went to the United States from Rogliano, a small town near Cosenza in Calabria.  After spending some time in Washington State, they settled in Gilroy and Hollister, agriculturally-oriented cities south of San Francisco, near San Jose.  In Gilroy and Hollister, they owned various types of orchards./nFilice was born in Hollister, California on August 19, 1922.  He was the firstborn son of Francesco and Antonia (Antoinette) Filice.  The elder Francesco Filice died before his son's birth. Filice's birth certificate lists his name as \"Franciesco Pasquale Patricio Filice\" (sic), while his baptismal certificate reads \"Francesco Pasqual Filice\" (sic)./nFilice grew up on Judah Street in San Francisco's inner Sunset District, but he also spent much of his childhood with his cousins in Gilroy and Hollister.  When he was a young boy, his widowed mother married Francis Garofalo, a barber in San Francisco.  They had one daughter, Gloria Garofalo Pizzinelli.  Mrs. Pizzinelli inhabits the family home on Judah Street to this day and has three children of her own, as well as ten grandchildren./nFilice graduated from St. Anne of the Sunset Catholic School in 1935.  He attended Polytechnic High School, and then the Christian Brothers' Sacred Heart High School, where he distinguished himself academically./nIn 1939, Filice enrolled at the University of San Francisco - San Francisco's Jesuit university - where he took the Bachelor of Science in 1943. In 1945, he earned the Master of Science degree at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1949, he earned the Ph.D., also at Berkeley. He published his doctoral dissertation Studies on the Cytology and Life History of a Giardia From the Laboratory Rat (Berkeley: University of California Press) in 1952./nIn 1947, Filice accepted a position as professor of biology at the University of San Francisco, where he would teach for almost 30 years./nAmong Filice's scholarly work in the field of parasitology was a study based upon his doctoral research to characterize the life cycle of the medically significant parasite causing Giardiasis./nIn the early 1950s, Filice and co-workers investigated levels of amino acids in the body tissues of various marine invertebrates including seastars, sea urchins and spoon worms.  They were the first to demonstrate that various marine invertebrates maintain high concentrations of amino acids in their tissues in comparison to vertebrate animals./nLater in that decade, Filice embarked on a scientific expedition to Baja California, and he was a leader in the \"Save The Bay\" organization and movement in San Francisco, which sought to deter City planners from filling in the San Francisco Bay in order to increase development of the Bay Area.  In this respect, he published three significant studies in the field of marine ecology:/nAlso central to his work as a professor of biology was anti-abortion activism and the defense of unborn human life./nPrior to the late 1960s, abortion was illegal in every state of the United States, except in cases where the pregnancy posed a risk to the mother's life. This changed in 1967 when Colorado became the first state to legalize abortion in cases of rape, incest, or when there was a threat of permanent disability to the pregnant women. During this period, when the topic of overpopulation first became widely discussed, Filice recalls that not a month would pass when he did not receive, as a biology professor at USF, a free copy of a textbook which called into question population growth. The first such book was The Population Bomb. Dr. Filice found the arguments made in such books unconvincing and began to speak against them at various meetings./nAt this time, Filice was invited to participate in a panel discussing concerns over population at a local high school, by a former student of his who was teaching biology. In his observation, the speakers affiliated with Planned Parenthood and the representative of the Human Population Institute of Stanford only talked about how to get an abortion, without addressing the population question at all. This concerned Filice, and, as a result, he called the chancery of the Archdiocese of San Francisco to ask what they were doing to respond. Finding out that they did not have a plan for action, Filice asked if they minded if he tried something. The Chancellor of the Archdiocese told him to go ahead./nFilice had a student, John Martin, who had become a Lutheran, and, when Filice expressed his concern about how things were developing, this student told him that his pastor had expressed the same concerns. As a result, he invited his pastor to have lunch with Filice at USF. Pastor Kangas was pastor of the Finnish Lutheran Church of St. Francis on Church Street in San Francisco. Pastor Kangas was from Ohio. Filice found him to be a very spiritual man./nFilice also invited to the lunch meeting Eileen Ziomeck (now Dr. Aicardi, a pediatrician in San Francisco), who, in Filice's words, was \"smartest student I ever had\".  The four people who attended the luncheon decided to start an educational group aimed at countering the claims regarding population growth made in the media./nPastor Kangas knew an Episcopalian minister who was of the same mind. He was Rev. Charles Carroll, chaplain at UCSF and pastor of the church that is now the Catholic chapel of St. John of God.[3]  Rev. Carroll had been a Catholic, at one time, but now served under the Episcopalian Bishop of San Francisco.  His presence on the committee added a socially upscale quality to the movement./nSo the four contacted Rev. Carroll and called a meeting.  St. Mary's Hospital let them use a meeting room.  No doctors were at the meeting. Those in attendance at this first meeting were: Filice, Eileen Ziomeck, John Martin, John Galten, Clayton Barbeau (a Catholic author), Rev. Bernie Bush, S.J., Rev. Theodore Taheny, S.J.,[4] Rev. Carroll, Pastor Kangas, Bob Augros (a philosophy professor at USF), and others whom Filice cannot remember. He does remember that there were fourteen people present./nThey decided that the political problem was impractical to address directly, and that what was needed was an educational group to counter the arguments of the pro-choice movement. Filice remembers going around the room and asking each if they wanted to be chairman, but each of them declined. So, by default, Filice became the chairman of this emergent anti-abortion group in San Francisco. Thus was born United for Life of San Francisco./nUnited for Life met every two weeks for the next seven years. At their first official meeting, Dr. Raymond Dennehy came up from Santa Clara University, where he taught philosophy. Dr. Augros and he took the task of countering the arguments of their opposition, and they developed a pamphlet in question-and-answer form that became the source of arguments against abortion for all the anti-abortion groups in the United States. This pamphlet was later the basis of a book by Dr. Jack and Barbara Willke from Ohio.[5]/nUnited for Life developed the first anti-abortion newsletter in the United States and contacted all the groups in California and the United States. In most densely populated areas, ad hoc groups formed.  For example, across the bay in Oakland, \"Voice of the Unborn\" was formed by a number of housewives. In Los Angeles, a right-to-life organization was formed by a group of doctors' wives. There was a network of such groups who brought information to their legislatures and to young people.[6]/nIn addition, United for Life developed speakers bureaus: lawyers, scientists, students, and women who went to every school in the Bay Area to present the anti-abortion message.[7]  They purchased films which explored prenatal development.  They asked to address every event in the Bay Area where their opposition would be.[8]/nUnited for Life organized the opposition to the bills in the California State Assembly to strike down all the abortion laws, and they \"defeated it handsomely.\"/nMary Ann Schwab and Alice Austurias, members of United for Life, organized the Catholic Office for Life in the Archdiocese of San Francisco and staffed it for many years. Some of the members of United for Life organized the Political Action organization in California as a separate organization because of the tax laws./nThe Birthright organization was started in San Francisco by Dr. Filice's second-oldest daughter, Carol Brown.  A similar organization with the same name had been started in Toronto, Ontario. Brown and her helpers contacted the Toronto office, and they joined with the international organization. This helped the spread of Birthright offices on the West Coast./nOf Roe v. Wade, Filice has stated: \"A purely fabricated case went to the Supreme Court and Justice Blackmun, without shame, wrote a majority opinion that is a masterpiece of false logic. The Court struck down all the laws protecting the child. In doing so they threw our legal system into a shambles.  To this day, the effects are felt in the grossly unjust decisions made by the courts to protect the capacity to kill the child in the womb\"./nFilice finds noteworthy that the anti-abortion effort was the first effort by Catholic lay people in the United States without the help of the clergy; it was an entirely lay movement, the first, in Filice's experience, in the United States where the people acted without the leadership of their pastors.  This was important because the Catholic organizers wanted non-Catholics to join in.  Their conviction was that abortion is a human problem and not just a religious one.  The early anti-abortion activists felt that they, as citizens, had to educate the voters in the United States.  As a result, many Catholic priests felt that it was not their fight.  All that has changed by now, Fr. Filice points out: Priests for Life  grew out of United for Life./nIn 1947, Filice married Barbara Ann Fate, the daughter of Michael and Blanche Fate.  Michael Fate was half Italian and half Irish, and Blanche Fate was half Irish and half Swedish.  Ms. Fate had earned a baccalaureate degree at Lone Mountain College in San Francisco./nFilice had six children.[citation needed] The Filice Family would settle on 24th Avenue in San Francisco's Richmond District, attending St. Monica's parish and school.  Filice's daughters attended Presentation High School, while his sons attended St. Ignatius, San Francisco's Jesuit high school./nIn the early 1960s, Filice participated in one of the first cursillo retreats given in San Francisco, and he became a Third Order Carmelite.  In 1964, he took his family on a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City.  From the early 1960s to the middle 1970s, Filice was involved with the St. Vincent de Paul Society and the anti-abortion movement./nMrs. Filice died from complications related to kidney failure on February 11, 1976.  Soon after, Dr. Filice retired from his professorship at the University of San Francisco and was accepted by Archbishop Joseph Thomas McGucken as a seminarian of the Archdiocese of San Francisco.  From 1977 to 1979, he was engaged in formation for the priesthood at St. Patrick's Seminary in Menlo Park, CA.  He was ordained a priest of Jesus Christ on May 19, 1979[9] at St. Mary's Cathedral in San Francisco.  The ordaining prelate was Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco./nFilice served as a parochial vicar in various parishes of the Archdiocese of San Francisco until 1986, when, with the permission of Archbishop Quinn, he established the Holy Family Oratory of St. Philip Neri in the Archdiocese of San Francisco.[10]  The impetus for the foundation of the Oratory was an awareness of the attacks on the family in the West, which had taken deep root in the culture.  Fr. Filice sought to combat these evils by engaging in a sustained and organized apostolic service to the family in the context of the Oratorian life.  In addition, he saw the common life of the Oratory as a healthy form of community life for secular priests engaged in pastoral ministry.  The Oratory had pastoral care of the students of San Francisco State University until 1991, when it transferred its operations to the parish of San Jose de la Mesa in Tijuana, Mexico.[11]  Fr. Filice served there until 1996, when Archbishop William Levada called him home to the Archdiocese of San Francisco.[12]  Fr. Filice was assigned to be chaplain of the Veterans Administration Hospital in San Francisco.  He served in that capacity until his retirement in the early 2000s./nFilice then resided in San Francisco as senior priest in residence at St. Thomas the Apostle Church in the outer Richmond District.  He also served as full-time chaplain to the Sisters of Perpetual Adoration at 771 Ashbury Street in San Francisco.  He was also part-time chaplain at the San Francisco County Jail, the Richmond Jail, and the San Bruno Jail, and at the Novitiate of Blessed Teresa of Calcutta's Missionaries of Charity, at St. Paul's on Church Street in the Noe Valley neighborhood of the Mission District./nFilice died on July 17, 2015, at Nazareth House in San Rafael surrounded by many of his family members. He was 92 years of age and until recent months had remained quite active in his ministry since his ordination in 1979.[13]", "169056": "Martinus Willem Beijerinck (Dutch pronunciation: [m\u0251r\u02c8tin\u028fs \u02c8\u028b\u026al\u0259m \u02c8b\u025bi\u0259r\u026a\u014bk], 16 March 1851 \u2013 1 January 1931) was a Dutch microbiologist and botanist who was one of the founders of virology and environmental microbiology. He is credited with the discovery of viruses, which he called \"contagium vivum fluidum\"./nBorn in Amsterdam, Beijerinck studied at the Technical School of Delft, where he was awarded the degree of biology in 1872. He obtained his Doctor of Science degree from the University of Leiden in 1877.[1]/nAt the time, Delft, then a Polytechnic, did not have the right to confer doctorates, so Leiden did this for them. He became a teacher in microbiology at the Agricultural School in Wageningen (now Wageningen University) and later at the Polytechnische Hogeschool Delft (Delft Polytechnic, currently Delft University of Technology) (from 1895). He established the Delft School of Microbiology. His studies of agricultural and industrial microbiology yielded fundamental discoveries in the field of biology. His achievements have been perhaps unfairly overshadowed by those of his contemporaries, Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur, because unlike them, Beijerinck never studied human disease./nIn 1877, he wrote his first notable research paper, discussing plant galls. The paper later became the basis for his doctoral dissertation.[2]/nIn 1885 he became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[3]/nHe is considered one of the founders of virology.[4][5][6][7] In 1898, he published results on the filtration experiments demonstrating that tobacco mosaic disease is caused by an infectious agent smaller than a bacterium.[8]/nHis results were in accordance with the similar observation made by Dmitri Ivanovsky in 1892.[9] Like Ivanovsky before him and Adolf Mayer, predecessor at Wageningen, Beijerinck could not culture the filterable infectious agent; however, he concluded that the agent can replicate and multiply in living plants. He named the new pathogen virus to indicate its non-bacterial nature. Beijerinck asserted that the virus was somewhat liquid in nature, calling it \"contagium vivum fluidum\" (contagious living fluid).[10] It was not until the first crystals of the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) obtained by Wendell Stanley in 1935, the first electron micrographs of TMV produced in 1939 and the first X-ray crystallographic analysis of TMV performed in 1941 proved that the virus was particulate./nNitrogen fixation,[11] the process by which diatomic nitrogen gas is converted to ammonium ions and becomes available to plants, was also investigated by Beijerinck. Bacteria perform nitrogen fixation, dwelling inside root nodules of certain plants (legumes). In addition to having discovered a biochemical reaction vital to soil fertility and agriculture, Beijerinck revealed this archetypical example of symbiosis between plants and bacteria./nBeijerinck discovered the phenomenon of bacterial sulfate reduction, a form of anaerobic respiration. He learned bacteria could use sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor, instead of oxygen. This discovery has had an important impact on our current understanding of biogeochemical cycles. Spirillum desulfuricans, now known as Desulfovibrio desulfuricans,[12] the first known sulfate-reducing bacterium, was isolated and described by Beijerinck./nBeijerinck invented the enrichment culture, a fundamental method of studying microbes from the environment. He is often incorrectly credited with framing the microbial ecology idea that \"everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects\", which was stated by Lourens Baas Becking.[13][14]/nBeijerinck was a socially eccentric figure. He was verbally abusive to students, never married, and had few professional collaborations. He was also known for his ascetic lifestyle and his view of science and marriage being incompatible. His low popularity with his students and their parents periodically depressed him, as he very much loved spreading his enthusiasm for biology in the classroom. After his retirement at the Delft School of Microbiology in 1921, at age 70, he moved to Gorssel where he lived for the rest of his life, together with his two sisters.[15]/nBeijerinckia (a genus of bacteria),[16] Beijerinckiaceae (a family of Hyphomicrobiales), and Beijerinck crater are named after him./nThe M.W.

At Cornell he studied the uptake and metabolism of ammonia in cyanobacteria./nIn 1984, upon completing his postdoctoral studies and returning to Israel, Boussiba joined the Microalgal Biotechnology Laboratory (MBL) at Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research BIDR, BGU. He has served as the head of the lab since 1995.[1] During the years 2001\u20132005 he also served as the substitute to the director of BIDR and during the years 2008\u20132015 he served as director of the French Associates Institute for Agriculture and Biotechnology of Drylands at BIDR./nIn 2003 Boussiba was awarded an honorary doctorate (honoris causa) from the University of West Hungary, which was the first European university to establish an agriculture faculty.[2] He was bestowed with the economical botanics chair from BGU. Since 2004 he has served in the board of directors of the International Society of Applied Phycology.[3] In 2005 he was elected as the president of the society, and also served as its president between 2008 and 2011. In a conference which took place in Australia in June 2014, Professor Boussiba received a special award of appreciation from this society, for his continual and outstanding contribution to the field of applied phycology research. Between 2009 and 2012 Boussiba served as a member of the board of directors at the Inter-University Marine Biology and Biotechnology Institute in Eilat. In 2009 he was elected for an ad-hoc committee nominated by the National Science Academy of the United States, aimed at examining the sustainable development of algal fuels and oils,[4] in which he served for two years. The committee's conclusions were published in a report aiming to formulate the US government's policy on alternative fuels.[5] Since 2009 Boussiba has also served as a member of the European Algae Biomass Association (EABA), and since 2014 he has served as the head of its scientific board.[6]/nProduction of astaxanthin from the haematococcus microalgae:[7] The Haematococcus Pluvialis microalgae has been extensively researched for its ability to accumulate large quantities of the astaxanthin pigment, which is a potent naturally occurring anti-oxidant.[8] A synthetic version of this pigment is currently used for obtaining pink-colored salmon fish for marketing.[9] The production of this pigment in Haematococcus Pluvialis is enhanced due to various environmental stresses which limit the growth of the cell under light conditions. The production process is characterized by a transition in the cell's color from green to red, along with various chemical and biochemical changes within the cell which have been widely studied in recent years: defining the conditions under which the pigment is accumulated, studying the biosynthetic process; and examining the possible role of the pigment in protecting the cell from oxidative stress damage. One outcome of this work was the development of a two-stage process for production of astaxanthin \u2013 the algae is allowed to grow under optimal conditions for the green stage, then the biomass is subjected to stress conditions such as high light or nutrient deprivation./nOne of the main challenges in large-scale production of biomass is the susceptibility to infections, especially when the growth medium is poor in nutrients- enabling the growth of various fungi and foreign algae.  Indeed, one of the main pests which can cause the collapse of the Haematococcus Pluvialis culture is a fungus. In Prof. Boussiba's lab this fungus has been researched and isolated and defined as a new species (Paraphyzoderma Sedebokerensis[10]). This fungi is a specific parasite for Haematococci cells. Following its cultivation under sterile conditions, its life cycle was defined and its mode of infection was studied. Results showed that there are special proteins (lectins) present on the zeospheres of the fungi which recognize specific sugar moieties upon the algal cell wall. The infection process begins with the interaction between the lectins and the sugar moieties, and can end with the collapse of the algae culture./nProf. Boussiba's researches, spanning over ten years of work, were the basis for the establishment of an astaxanthin production plant from the Haematococcus microalgae in Kibbutz Ketura in the Arava valley \u2013 Algatech, which has been active since 2002.[11]/nCloning of Bti bacterial genes into the Anabaena cyanobacteria for eradication of tropical diseases: The Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) group of bacteria is an important agent used for biological pest control. Bt is a Gram positive, aerobic bacterium which during its sporulation stage produces an endotoxin protein crystal with high toxicity and specificity against various insect larvae. Bt toxins are termed insecticidal crystal proteins (ICPs) and are active within the intestine, thus must be digested by the target organism in order to act. The subspecies Bacillus thuringienesis israelensis (Bti) was isolated by Prof. Joel Margalit and colleagues (1977). It is a specific pesticide of mosquito larvae and of black flies, which transfer a large number of tropical, sometimes fatal diseases. This subspecies produces a crystal composed of four main proteins encoded by four genes which are situated on a single plasmid within the bacterium. However, the use of Bti as a biological pesticide is limited due to its low survivability rate in natural water ponds.\nOne of the ways to overcome the survivability hurdle is to clone the genes encoding for the toxin into other organisms which are more adapted to the harsh environments in question. Due to their large species diversity and high abundancy in natural ponds and rice fields, cyanobacteria have high potential to serve as carriers for the endotoxin genes for pest control of mosquito larvae. Moreover, cyanobacteria are able to float in the upper layer of the water, and are stable under varying environmental conditions, as well as throughout entire growth cycles of the mosquitos, which feed off the cyanobacteria. The most lethal combination of Bti genes was cloned in Prof. Boussiba's laboratory in the Anabaena PCC 7120 cyanobacteria.[12][13] This pioneering work yielded a transgenic cyanobacteria stably expressing four different Bti genes. The transgenic lines are very stable and are of high toxicity to the larvae. Moreover, they survived under field conditions for longer periods of time than the commercially available Bti pesticide. Since these clones are considered genetically modified organisms (GMO), the widespread use of this technology is still limited. This project, which lasted for several years, included the training of many research students and several prestigious research grants were obtained for it. This project is an example for the fruitful cooperation between two groups which are leading in their field \u2013 Prof.  Zaritsky's lab and Prof. Boussiba's, where the transgenic cyanobacteria were isolated./nIn recent years Prof. Boussiba's researches are focusing on genetic methods for improving microalgae in aim to produce valuable products such as carotenoids and PUFA \u2013 polyunsaturated fatty acids.[14] One of the results of these researches is the development of a genetic engineering system for inserting genes into the genomes of two microalgal species of high economical value \u2013 Haematococcus Pluvialis for increasing the production rate of astaxanthin, and Parietochloris Incisa \u2013 for metabolic engineering of PUFA. Prof. Boussiba has led research projects in cooperation with researchers in Israel and worldwide, and during recent years he has been a partner in a large number of projects under the umbrella of the FP7 program of the European Union. He recently (2010\u20132013) managed the GIAVAP project- Genetically improved Algae for Valuable Products,[15][16] in which ten European and two industrial companies from Israel and from abroad took part. This project was aimed at genetic modification of microalgae for production of valuable (5.4 MEuro) products.[17] Prof. Boussiba is also a partner of the Israeli consortium for solar fuels, of the Israeli Centers of Research Excellence \u2013 ICORE,[18] for which Ben-Gurion University was awarded with 3 million sheqels over the years 2012\u20132016. At the end of 2015 his lab received an additional grant of 1.7 million sheqels over three years from the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture, for developing an innovative system for vaccinating poultry against the Newcastle Disease, using genetically modified microalgae.", "1905773": "Denis Anthony Mitchison CMG (6 September 1919 \u2013 2 July 2018) was a British bacteriologist.[1][2]/nMitchison was born in Oxford in 1919,[3] the son of the Labour politician Dick Mitchison and his wife, the writer Naomi (n\u00e9e Haldane).  His uncle was the biologist J.B.S. Haldane and his grandfather the physiologist John Scott Haldane.  His younger brothers are the zoologists Avrion Mitchison and the late Murdoch Mitchison./nIn 1954 Denis Mitchison's mother wrote the fantasy book Graeme and the Dragon, in which the protagonist is her grandson, Denis's son Graeme Mitchison./nHe was educated at the Dragon School, Oxford, and Abbotsholme School, going on to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied natural science, obtaining a 1st class degree and a senior scholarship. He only then changed to medicine, qualifying from University College in 1943, and chose postgraduate training in pathology./nHis first job in pathology was at the Brompton Hospital at the time that the first clinical trial with a randomised intake between treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) with streptomycin or with bed rest alone was run./nMitchison then continued his lifelong interest in the treatment of TB, participating in the clinical trials organised by the Medical Research Council's Tuberculosis Research Unit (MRC TRU) with Director Philip D'Arcy Hart./nFollowing the decisive importance of drug-resistant tubercle bacilli in treatment, he was appointed in 1964 as director of a new MRC Unit on Drug Resistance in Tuberculosis (later changed to MRC Unit for Laboratory Studies of Tuberculosis) at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School.  He then worked closely with D'Arcy Hart at the MRC TRU and later with Wallace Fox, director of the MRC Tuberculosis and Chest Diseases Research Unit, on developing effective treatment for TB at a cost sufficiently low to be affordable in developing countries./nThe framework of this work was a series of clinical trials in the UK and in larger numbers in East Africa, India, Hong Kong, Singapore and Czechoslovakia. This work passed through two stages; the first dealt with the problem of drug-resistant tubercle bacilli, which was solved by the use of regimens incorporating 2, 3 or 4 different anti-tuberculosis drugs./nStarting with a publication in 1970, the second phase dealt with the shortening the treatment period from at least 12 months to 6 months by using rifampicin and pyrazinamide in so-called \"short-course\" regimens which have been the basis of current standard therapy with 2 months of 4 drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) followed by 4 months of rifampicin and isoniazid./nHe established specialist TB laboratories in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia and a central laboratory in Hong Kong./nHe published about 250 papers dealing with (1) factors slowing the growth of tubercle bacilli that might account for the lengthy duration of treatment, including the first paper on the effects of anaerobic culture; (2) with Jean Dickinson on post-antibiotic effects to account for the success of intermittent drug dosage; (3) the curious characteristics of attenuated South Indian strains of TB; (4) the response to treatment when the strains were initially resistant to the drugs allowing identification of the action of individual drugs./nAfter his notional[3] retirement in 1985, he continued working first at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith and then at St George's, University of London. He developed the technique of measuring the early bactericidal activity of drugs, which is now standard practice as the initial step in the phase II of clinical development of new drugs with Amina Jindani and colleagues in South Africa. He also introduced the concept of the 8-week phase II study with the proportion of patients obtaining negative sputum culture at 8 weeks, a standard assessment in most such studies. More recently he developed a new type of phase II 8-week study using modelling of counts of TB in sputum during treatment (with Geraint Davies and the South African MRC). He worked on several new anti-TB drugs and participated in clinical trials on high dosage rifamycins./nMitchison finally stopped regular work at the age of 95.  He died in Kingston in July 2018 at the age of 98[4] of bilateral pulmonary embolism.[3]", "60593263": "Richard Jude Samulski (born 1954) is an American scientist, inventor, and academic recognized for his pioneering work in gene therapy and adeno-associated virus vectors (AAV) in the fields of molecular virology and pharmacology.[1]/nSamulski is the former director of the UNC Gene Therapy Center and a member of the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center./nSamulski earned his Ph.D. at the University of Florida in 1982[2] and his B.S. at Clemson University in 1976.[3] He was president of the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy in 2011.[4] His contributions to scientific literature include 208 academic publications,[5] and 408 research items,[6] broadly cited by their scholarly discipline with 3,158 patent citations and 17,140 scholarly citations.[7]/nHe co-founded biotechnology companies active in gene therapy and AAV commercialization,[8] including AskBio (Asklepios BioPharmaceutical Inc.), a biotechnology company focused on AAV gene therapy,[9][10] NanoCor Therapeutics, Inc.[11] Chatham  Therapeutics, Inc. and Bamboo Therapeutics, Inc, spinoffs from Asklepios BioPharmaceutical Inc.[12] He was the director of the UNC School of Medicine Gene Therapy Center in Chapel Hill, North Carolina until 2016.[13]/nSamulski\u2019s research has focused on the study of the human non-pathogenic parvovirus adeno-associated virus (AAV) and its use in gene therapies.[14] In the 1980s, as a graduate student, he pioneered the use of AAV as a vector for therapeutic genes.[15][13]  In 1984, he cloned the virus DNA into a bacterial plasmid. This led to the recognition of the potential of AAV and also formed the foundation for the two current FDA-approved AAV gene therapies.[10] His work demonstrated AAV2 as a viral vector for gene therapy which led to the first U.S. Patent for inserting genes into AAV.[16] This technique has been used in gene therapy clinical trials for cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy,[17] haemophilia[18] and Parkinson\u2019s disease, and the foundation for gene therapy research and development in the bioscience industry and academic institutions such as UNC.[19] In 2016, Pfizer acquired his company, Bamboo Therapeutics,[20] and in 2014, Baxter International acquired Chatham Therapeutics and programs developed by AskBio.[21]/nIn 2008, Samulski was the first person to receive the Outstanding Achievement Award by the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy, which recognized his lifetime of significant scientific contributions to the field of gene therapy.[14] He holds 98 U.S. and foreign patents and has also been recognized as a co-inventor on other patents, all of which are related to gene delivery associated with adeno-associated virus vectors.[22][23][24]", "64296048": "Robert Kent Trench (August 3, 1940 - April 27, 2021) was an American Biologist who was a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. His research considered corals and symbiotic algae, with a focus on the adaption of zooxanthellae. He was awarded the 1994 International Society of Endocytobiology Miescher-Ishida Prize./nTrench was born in Belize City in British Honduras.[1] Where he was raised by his grandmother and lived in close proximity to the islands along Belize\u2019s barrier reef. As a result would spend a lot of his free time in the water around them which led him to grow close to nature. For school he attended the Jesuit High School in Belize City. He would often cite the education he received there as serving him for the rest of his life. This in combination with his relationship with nature is likely what led to his successful career in marine science.[2] He earned his undergraduate degree at the University of the West Indies. He moved to the University of California, Los Angeles for his doctoral research, where he focussed on invertebrate zoology in the laboratory of Leonard Muscatine.[1] Trench earned his doctorate in 1969 and moved to the University of Oxford as a postdoctoral fellow.[3]/nTrench became an assistant professor of Biology at Yale University in 1972 before moving in 1976 and joining the staff at University of California Santa Barbara as a professor. While at UCSB he taught a course on the biology and geology of coral reefs as well as a co-instructor for an Invertebrate biology course. He was once quoted about his teaching saying, \u201cI want to teach them how to learn on their own, so that I become irrelevant.\u201d After 28 years he retired from teaching in 2000.[2][4] His research considered corals and symbiotic algae, with a focus on the adaption of zooxanthellae and how they adapt to different coral environments. He studied dinoflagellates, which can be used as an indicator of water quality.[5]/nSome of Trench\u2019s most impactful work is his research on animal-dinoflagellate mutualisms.  Trench redefined the global perspective on host/symbiont relationships.  During the 1970s and 1980s, the prevailing view on this symbiosis was that the host dominated the relationship and fully controlled the symbiont.  Through his research, Trench challenged this mindset and concluded that the symbiont\u2019s attributes are critical to the establishment and maintenance of the symbiotic relationship.[4]/nTrench pursued his doctoral degree at the University of California, Los Angeles under the guidance of his advisor, Leonard Muscatine.  Muscatine used radioactive Carbon-14 to measure the exchange rates of carbon from the symbiont to the animal.  Here, Trench focused his dissertation research on the transfer rates and total amounts of photosynthetically fixed carbon translocated to the animal from its symbiont.  By isolating various symbionts from their hosts, Trench determined that different symbionts did not produce the same photosynthetic products.  This work foreshadowed the idea we now hold to be true today: not all symbionts are the same.  This work further proved the symbiont also plays a critical role in the host\u2019s life. [4]/nTrench\u2019s first research paper was published in the journal Nature (journal) in 1969 on the topic of photosynthetic animals.  It was published while Trench was a post-doctoral scholar at Oxford University but still remains one of his favorites.  While research at the time rejected the importance of agal chloroplasts in sea slug, his research disproved this belief.  Trench demonstrated that even after being engulfed by the sea slug\u2019s digestive cells, the ingested chloroplasts were still functional.  His work showed that the chloroplasts continued to photosynthesize for extended periods of time following engulfment and functioned as \u201ccaptive\u201d intracellular organelles.  The animals reaped the benefits of additional and reliable nutrients from their photosynthetic inhabitants.  Trench was awarded the Miescher-Ishida Prize for his innovative work. [4]/nIn 1972, Trench moved to Yale University as an Assistant Professor where his research dissertation was mentored by Luigi Provasoli.  Trench built on Provasoli\u2019s work by isolating numerous cell cultures from various hosts.  From this, Trench, along with his graduate student Dave Schoenberg, showed that isolated cultures were fundamentally different when grown under the same environmental conditions such as nutrient, light, and temperature.  Using karyotypes, they also showed that the genus Symbiodinium sensu late comprised more than just one species. [4]/nTrench moved to the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1976.  Trench guided the first detailed research examining the differences in photo physiological capacities of different symbiont species. This work contributed to the characterization of the photosynthetic apparatus of dinoflagellates.  By doing so, they found that different species possessed distinct photo physiological adaptations.  [4]/nTrench\u2019s lab also showed that these symbionts are sensitive to temperature stress, a crisis we are currently facing known as Coral bleaching.  Additionally, Trench established the functional biological and ecological significance of symbiont diversity to reef-building corals.  Trench worked with his graduate student Roberto Igelsias-Prieto to develop a concept on how host-symbiont combinations partially determine coral physiological responses to environmental pressures.  Their work also explained how corals possessing large biogeographic distributions could occupy a broad range of habitats and depths.  The groundbreaking research Trench did on corals laid the foundations for current coral restoration efforts. \nMuch of Trench\u2019s lab work was focused in the laboratory.  \tHis lab used Aiptasia and Cassiopea as experimental models to study host-symbiont relationships under controlled conditions.  Using these models, they helped to characterize the cellular processes involved in host-symbiont relationships as well as determine patterns of host-symbiont specificity.[4]/nTo extend on his interests in symbiotic relationships, Trench studied the mutualism between single-celled flagellates (cyanophora paradoza) and photosynthetic bacteria (cyanocyta korshikoffiana).  From this, he determined that the flagellates rely on the photosynthetic processes of the cyanobacteria making it a mutually obligate relationship.  This relationship is an ideal model for studying the evolution of chloroplasts.\nMuch of Trench\u2019s work and original insights remain the basis of ongoing investigations today.[4]/nIn 1984 Trench was awarded a Queen Elizabeth II to move to Australia and study the Great Barrier Reef.[3] He visited the James Cook University, where he analyzed the enzymes in the algae within coral tissues.[3]/nIn 1994 he was awarded the International Society of Endocytobiology Miescher-Ishida Prize.[6] In 2010 he was awarded the Healthy Reefs for Healthy People Lifetime Achievement Award./nHe serves as an advisor for the Global Coral Reef Alliance.[7] He retired from academic science in 2000,/nBob\u2019s roots were a melting pot consisting of indigenous Central American, Spanish, African, and Jewish lineages. As a result he encountered many acts of racism in his years in the United States. On several occasions while at UCSB Trench was stopped and questioned by police because he did not \u201clook like he belonged on campus.\u201d Even more unfairly Bob would have to watch as his white colleagues were given grants for their research as he was told his work was \u201ctoo interdisciplinary\u201d to receive any grants and was never given a proper review. Regarding this he was quoted as saying \u201cNo matter what I do in science, to some people I will always just be a [slur]...\u201d to his long term colleague and friend Tom Goreau Jr. Tom Goreau Jr\u2019s father, Tom Goreau Sr. had been training Bob to be the Director of the Discovery Bay Marine Lab (DBML) after he finished his Post-Doctoral fellowship at Oxford University and could return to Jamaica, when he suddenly died of cancer in 1970. This placed the control of the Director of the DBML in the hands of the British Zoology Department who immediately eliminated Bob from contention as they decided a White man was needed for the position. Despite all of this, Bob was never afraid of vocalizing his experience as a minority and the racial biases that he encountered. He hoped that his responses to these situations would help to inspire future students and peers.[2][4]/nGoreau, Thomas J. Trench, Robert Kent (2013).

He is known as the \"father of modern taxonomy\".[4] Many of his writings were in Latin; his name is rendered in Latin as Carolus Linn\u00e6us and, after his 1761 ennoblement, as Carolus a Linn\u00e9./nLinnaeus was the son of a curate[5] and he was born in R\u00e5shult, the countryside of Sm\u00e5land, in southern Sweden. He received most of his higher education at Uppsala University and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730. He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738, where he studied and also published the first edition of his Systema Naturae in the Netherlands. He then returned to Sweden where he became professor of medicine and botany at Uppsala. In the 1740s, he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals. In the 1750s and 1760s, he continued to collect and classify animals, plants, and minerals, while publishing several volumes. By the time of his death in 1778, he was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe./nPhilosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau sent him the message: \"Tell him I know no greater man on Earth.\"[6] Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote: \"With the exception of Shakespeare and Spinoza, I know no one among the no longer living who has influenced me more strongly.\"[6] Swedish author August Strindberg wrote: \"Linnaeus was in reality a poet who happened to become a naturalist.\"[7] Linnaeus has been called Princeps botanicorum (Prince of Botanists) and \"The Pliny of the North\".[8] He is also considered one of the founders of modern ecology.[9]/nIn botany and zoology, the abbreviation L. is used to indicate Linnaeus as the authority for a species' name.[10] In older publications, the abbreviation \"Linn.\" is found. Linnaeus's remains constitute the type specimen for the species Homo sapiens following the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, since the sole specimen that he is known to have examined was himself.[note 2]/nLinnaeus was born in the village of R\u00e5shult in Sm\u00e5land, Sweden, on 23 May 1707. He was the first child of Nicolaus (Nils) Ingemarsson (who later adopted the family name Linnaeus) and Christina Brodersonia. His siblings were Anna Maria Linn\u00e6a, Sofia Juliana Linn\u00e6a, Samuel Linn\u00e6us (who would eventually succeed their father as rector of Stenbrohult and write a manual on beekeeping),[11][12][13] and Emerentia Linn\u00e6a.[14] His father taught him Latin as a small child.[15]/nOne of a long line of peasants and priests, Nils was an amateur botanist, a Lutheran minister, and the curate of the small village of Stenbrohult in Sm\u00e5land. Christina was the daughter of the rector of Stenbrohult, Samuel Brodersonius.[16]/nA year after Linnaeus's birth, his grandfather Samuel Brodersonius died, and his father Nils became the rector of Stenbrohult. The family moved into the rectory from the curate's house.[17][18]/nEven in his early years, Linnaeus seemed to have a liking for plants, flowers in particular. Whenever he was upset, he was given a flower, which immediately calmed him. Nils spent much time in his garden and often showed flowers to Linnaeus and told him their names. Soon Linnaeus was given his own patch of earth where he could grow plants.[19]/nCarl's father was the first in his ancestry to adopt a permanent surname. Before that, ancestors had used the patronymic naming system of Scandinavian countries: his father was named Ingemarsson after his father Ingemar Bengtsson. When Nils was admitted to the University of Lund, he had to take on a family name. He adopted the Latinate name Linn\u00e6us after a giant linden tree (or lime tree), lind in Swedish, that grew on the family homestead.[11] This name was spelled with the \u00e6 ligature. When Carl was born, he was named Carl Linn\u00e6us, with his father's family name. The son also always spelled it with the \u00e6 ligature, both in handwritten documents and in publications.[17] Carl's patronymic would have been Nilsson, as in Carl Nilsson Linn\u00e6us.[20]/nLinnaeus's father began teaching him basic Latin, religion, and geography at an early age.[21] When Linnaeus was seven, Nils decided to hire a tutor for him. The parents picked Johan Telander, a son of a local yeoman. Linnaeus did not like him, writing in his autobiography that Telander \"was better calculated to extinguish a child's talents than develop them\".[22]/nTwo years after his tutoring had begun, he was sent to the Lower Grammar School at V\u00e4xj\u00f6 in 1717.[23] Linnaeus rarely studied, often going to the countryside to look for plants. At some point, his father went to visit him and, after hearing critical assessments by his preceptors, he decided to put the youth as an apprentice to some honest cobbler.[24] He reached the last year of the Lower School when he was fifteen, which was taught by the headmaster, Daniel Lannerus, who was interested in botany. Lannerus noticed Linnaeus's interest in botany and gave him the run of his garden./nHe also introduced him to Johan Rothman, the state doctor of Sm\u00e5land and a teacher at Katedralskolan (a gymnasium) in V\u00e4xj\u00f6. Also a botanist, Rothman broadened Linnaeus's interest in botany and helped him develop an interest in medicine.[25][26] By the age of 17, Linnaeus had become well acquainted with the existing botanical literature. He remarks in his journal that he \"read day and night, knowing like the back of my hand, Arvidh M\u00e5nsson's Rydaholm Book of Herbs, Tillandz's Flora \u00c5boensis, Palmberg's Serta Florea Suecana, Bromelii's Chloros Gothica and Rudbeckii's Hortus Upsaliensis\".[27]/nLinnaeus entered the V\u00e4xj\u00f6 Katedralskola in 1724, where he studied mainly Greek, Hebrew, theology and mathematics, a curriculum designed for boys preparing for the priesthood.[28][29] In the last year at the gymnasium, Linnaeus's father visited to ask the professors how his son's studies were progressing; to his dismay, most said that the boy would never become a scholar. Rothman believed otherwise, suggesting Linnaeus could have a future in medicine. The doctor offered to have Linnaeus live with his family in V\u00e4xj\u00f6 and to teach him physiology and botany. Nils accepted this offer.[30][31]/nRothman showed Linnaeus that botany was a serious subject. He taught Linnaeus to classify plants according to Tournefort's system. Linnaeus was also taught about the sexual reproduction of plants, according to S\u00e9bastien Vaillant.[30] In 1727, Linnaeus, age 21, enrolled in Lund University in Sk\u00e5ne.[32][33] He was registered as Carolus Linn\u00e6us, the Latin form of his full name, which he also used later for his Latin publications.[3]/nProfessor Kilian Stob\u00e6us, natural scientist, physician and historian, offered Linnaeus tutoring and lodging, as well as the use of his library, which included many books about botany. He also gave the student free admission to his lectures.[34][35] In his spare time, Linnaeus explored the flora of Sk\u00e5ne, together with students sharing the same interests.[36]/nIn August 1728, Linnaeus decided to attend Uppsala University on the advice of Rothman, who believed it would be a better choice if Linnaeus wanted to study both medicine and botany. Rothman based this recommendation on the two professors who taught at the medical faculty at Uppsala: Olof Rudbeck the Younger and Lars Roberg. Although Rudbeck and Roberg had undoubtedly been good professors, by then they were older and not so interested in teaching. Rudbeck no longer gave public lectures, and had others stand in for him. The botany, zoology, pharmacology and anatomy lectures were not in their best state.[37] In Uppsala, Linnaeus met a new benefactor, Olof Celsius, who was a professor of theology and an amateur botanist.[38] He received Linnaeus into his home and allowed him use of his library, which was one of the richest botanical libraries in Sweden.[39]/nIn 1729, Linnaeus wrote a thesis, Praeludia Sponsaliorum Plantarum on plant sexual reproduction. This attracted the attention of Rudbeck; in May 1730, he selected Linnaeus to give lectures at the University although the young man was only a second-year student. His lectures were popular, and Linnaeus often addressed an audience of 300 people.[40] In June, Linnaeus moved from Celsius's house to Rudbeck's to become the tutor of the three youngest of his 24 children. His friendship with Celsius did not wane and they continued their botanical expeditions.[41] Over that winter, Linnaeus began to doubt Tournefort's system of classification and decided to create one of his own. His plan was to divide the plants by the number of stamens and pistils. He began writing several books, which would later result in, for example, Genera Plantarum and Critica Botanica. He also produced a book on the plants grown in the Uppsala Botanical Garden, Adonis Uplandicus.[42]/nRudbeck's former assistant, Nils Ros\u00e9n, returned to the University in March 1731 with a degree in medicine. Ros\u00e9n started giving anatomy lectures and tried to take over Linnaeus's botany lectures, but Rudbeck prevented that. Until December, Ros\u00e9n gave Linnaeus private tutoring in medicine. In December, Linnaeus had a \"disagreement\" with Rudbeck's wife and had to move out of his mentor's house; his relationship with Rudbeck did not appear to suffer. That Christmas, Linnaeus returned home to Stenbrohult to visit his parents for the first time in about three years. His mother had disapproved of his failing to become a priest, but she was pleased to learn he was teaching at the University.[42][43]/nDuring a visit with his parents, Linnaeus told them about his plan to travel to Lapland; Rudbeck had made the journey in 1695, but the detailed results of his exploration were lost in a fire seven years afterwards. Linnaeus's hope was to find new plants, animals and possibly valuable minerals. He was also curious about the customs of the native Sami people, reindeer-herding nomads who wandered Scandinavia's vast tundras. In April 1732, Linnaeus was awarded a grant from the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala for his journey.[44][45]/nLinnaeus began his expedition from Uppsala on 12 May 1732, just before he turned 25.[46] He travelled on foot and horse, bringing with him his journal, botanical and ornithological manuscripts and sheets of paper for pressing plants. Near G\u00e4vle he found great quantities of Campanula serpyllifolia, later known as Linnaea borealis, the twinflower that would become his favourite.[47] He sometimes dismounted on the way to examine a flower or rock[48] and was particularly interested in mosses and lichens, the latter a main part of the diet of the reindeer, a common and economically important animal in Lapland.[49]/nLinnaeus travelled clockwise around the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, making major inland incursions from Ume\u00e5, Lule\u00e5 and Tornio. He returned from his six-month-long, over 2,000 kilometres (1,200\u00a0mi) expedition in October, having gathered and observed many plants, birds and rocks.[50][51][52] Although Lapland was a region with limited biodiversity, Linnaeus described about 100 previously unidentified plants. These became the basis of his book Flora Lapponica.[53][54] However, on the expedition to Lapland, Linnaeus used Latin names to describe organisms because he had not yet developed the binomial system.[46]/nIn Flora Lapponica Linnaeus's ideas about nomenclature and classification were first used in a practical way, making this the first proto-modern Flora.[55] The account covered 534 species, used the Linnaean classification system and included, for the described species, geographical distribution and taxonomic notes. It was Augustin Pyramus de Candolle who attributed Linnaeus with Flora Lapponica as the first example in the botanical genre of Flora writing. Botanical historian E. L. Greene described Flora Lapponica as \"the most classic and delightful\" of Linnaeus's works.[55]/nIt was also during this expedition that Linnaeus had a flash of insight regarding the classification of mammals. Upon observing the lower jawbone of a horse at the side of a road he was travelling, Linnaeus remarked: \"If I only knew how many teeth and of what kind every animal had, how many teats and where they were placed, I should perhaps be able to work out a perfectly natural system for the arrangement of all quadrupeds.\"[56]/nIn 1734, Linnaeus led a small group of students to Dalarna. Funded by the Governor of Dalarna, the expedition was to catalogue known natural resources and discover new ones, but also to gather intelligence on Norwegian mining activities at R\u00f8ros.[52]/nHis relations with Nils Ros\u00e9n having worsened, Linnaeus accepted an invitation from Claes Sohlberg, son of a mining inspector, to spend the Christmas holiday in Falun, where Linnaeus was permitted to visit the mines.[57]/nIn April 1735, at the suggestion of Sohlberg's father, Linnaeus and Sohlberg set out for the Dutch Republic, where Linnaeus intended to study medicine at the University of Harderwijk[58] while tutoring Sohlberg in exchange for an annual salary. At the time, it was common for Swedes to pursue doctoral degrees in the Netherlands, then a highly revered place to study natural history.[59]/nOn the way, the pair stopped in Hamburg, where they met the mayor, who proudly showed them a supposed wonder of nature in his possession: the taxidermied remains of a seven-headed hydra. Linnaeus quickly discovered the specimen was a fake, cobbled together from the jaws and paws of weasels and the skins of snakes. The provenance of the hydra suggested to Linnaeus that it had been manufactured by monks to represent the Beast of Revelation. Even at the risk of incurring the mayor's wrath, Linnaeus made his observations public, dashing the mayor's dreams of selling the hydra for an enormous sum. Linnaeus and Sohlberg were forced to flee from Hamburg.[60][61]/nLinnaeus began working towards his degree as soon as he reached Harderwijk, a university known for awarding degrees in as little as a week.[62] He submitted a dissertation, written back in Sweden, entitled Dissertatio medica inauguralis in qua exhibetur hypothesis nova de febrium intermittentium causa,[note 3] in which he laid out his hypothesis that malaria arose only in areas with clay-rich soils.[63] Although he failed to identify the true source of disease transmission, (i.e., the Anopheles mosquito),[64] he did correctly predict that Artemisia annua (wormwood) would become a source of antimalarial medications.[63]/nWithin two weeks he had completed his oral and practical examinations and was awarded a doctoral degree.[60][62]/nThat summer Linnaeus reunited with Peter Artedi, a friend from Uppsala with whom he had once made a pact that should either of the two predecease the other, the survivor would finish the decedent's work. Ten weeks later, Artedi drowned in the canals of Amsterdam, leaving behind an unfinished manuscript on the classification of fish.[65][66]/nOne of the first scientists Linnaeus met in the Netherlands was Johan Frederik Gronovius, to whom Linnaeus showed one of the several manuscripts he had brought with him from Sweden. The manuscript described a new system for classifying plants. When Gronovius saw it, he was very impressed, and offered to help pay for the printing. With an additional monetary contribution by the Scottish doctor Isaac Lawson, the manuscript was published as Systema Naturae (1735).[67][68]/nLinnaeus became acquainted with one of the most respected physicians and botanists in the Netherlands, Herman Boerhaave, who tried to convince Linnaeus to make a career there. Boerhaave offered him a journey to South Africa and America, but Linnaeus declined, stating he would not stand the heat. Instead, Boerhaave convinced Linnaeus that he should visit the botanist Johannes Burman. After his visit, Burman, impressed with his guest's knowledge, decided Linnaeus should stay with him during the winter. During his stay, Linnaeus helped Burman with his Thesaurus Zeylanicus. Burman also helped Linnaeus with the books on which he was working: Fundamenta Botanica and Bibliotheca Botanica.[69]/nIn August 1735, during Linnaeus's stay with Burman, he met George Clifford III, a director of the Dutch East India Company and the owner of a rich botanical garden at the estate of Hartekamp in Heemstede. Clifford was very impressed with Linnaeus's ability to classify plants, and invited him to become his physician and superintendent of his garden. Linnaeus had already agreed to stay with Burman over the winter, and could thus not accept immediately. However, Clifford offered to compensate Burman by offering him a copy of Sir Hans Sloane's Natural History of Jamaica, a rare book, if he let Linnaeus stay with him, and Burman accepted.[70][71] On 24 September 1735, Linnaeus moved to Hartekamp to become personal physician to Clifford, and curator of Clifford's herbarium. He was paid 1,000 florins a year, with free board and lodging. Though the agreement was only for a winter of that year, Linnaeus practically stayed there until 1738.[72] It was here that he wrote a book Hortus Cliffortianus, in the preface of which he described his experience as \"the happiest time of my life\". (A portion of Hartekamp was declared as public garden in April 1956 by the Heemstede local authority, and was named \"Linnaeushof\".[73] It eventually became, as it is claimed, the biggest playground in Europe.[74])/nIn July 1736, Linnaeus travelled to England, at Clifford's expense.[75] He went to London to visit Sir Hans Sloane, a collector of natural history, and to see his cabinet,[76] as well as to visit the Chelsea Physic Garden and its keeper, Philip Miller. He taught Miller about his new system of subdividing plants, as described in Systema Naturae. Miller was in fact reluctant to use the new binomial nomenclature, preferring the classifications of Joseph Pitton de Tournefort and John Ray at first. Linnaeus, nevertheless, applauded Miller's Gardeners Dictionary,[77] the conservative Scot actually retained in his dictionary a number of pre-Linnaean binomial signifiers discarded by Linnaeus but which have been retained by modern botanists. He only fully changed to the Linnaean system in the edition of The Gardeners Dictionary of 1768. Miller ultimately was impressed, and from then on started to arrange the garden according to Linnaeus's system.[78]/nLinnaeus also travelled to Oxford University to visit the botanist Johann Jacob Dillenius. He failed to make Dillenius publicly fully accept his new classification system, though the two men remained in correspondence for many years afterwards. Linnaeus dedicated his Critica Botanica to him, as \"opus botanicum quo absolutius mundus non-vidit\". Linnaeus would later name a genus of tropical tree Dillenia in his honour. He then returned to Hartekamp, bringing with him many specimens of rare plants.[79] The next year, 1737, he published Genera Plantarum, in which he described 935 genera of plants, and shortly thereafter he supplemented it with Corollarium Generum Plantarum, with another sixty (sexaginta) genera.[80]/nHis work at Hartekamp led to another book, Hortus Cliffortianus, a catalogue of the botanical holdings in the herbarium and botanical garden of Hartekamp. He wrote it in nine months (completed in July 1737), but it was not published until 1738.[69] It contains the first use of the name Nepenthes, which Linnaeus used to describe a genus of pitcher plants.[81][note 4]/nLinnaeus stayed with Clifford at Hartekamp until 18 October 1737 (new style), when he left the house to return to Sweden. Illness and the kindness of Dutch friends obliged him to stay some months longer in Holland. In May 1738, he set out for Sweden again. On the way home, he stayed in Paris for about a month, visiting botanists such as Antoine de Jussieu. After his return, Linnaeus never again left Sweden.[82][83]/nWhen Linnaeus returned to Sweden on 28 June 1738, he went to Falun, where he entered into an engagement to Sara Elisabeth Mor\u00e6a. Three months later, he moved to Stockholm to find employment as a physician, and thus to make it possible to support a family.[84][85] Once again, Linnaeus found a patron; he became acquainted with Count Carl Gustav Tessin, who helped him get work as a physician at the Admiralty.[86][87] During this time in Stockholm, Linnaeus helped found the Royal Swedish Academy of Science; he became the first Praeses of the academy by drawing of lots.[88]/nBecause his finances had improved and were now sufficient to support a family, he received permission to marry his fianc\u00e9e, Sara Elisabeth Mor\u00e6a. Their wedding was held 26 June 1739. Seventeen months later, Sara gave birth to their first son, Carl. Two years later, a daughter, Elisabeth Christina, was born, and the subsequent year Sara gave birth to Sara Magdalena, who died when 15 days old. Sara and Linnaeus would later have four other children: Lovisa, Sara Christina\u00a0[sv], Johannes and Sophia.[84][89]/nIn May 1741, Linnaeus was appointed Professor of Medicine at Uppsala University, first with responsibility for medicine-related matters. Soon, he changed place with the other Professor of Medicine, Nils Ros\u00e9n, and thus was responsible for the Botanical Garden (which he would thoroughly reconstruct and expand), botany and natural history, instead. In October that same year, his wife and nine-month-old son followed him to live in Uppsala.[90]/nTen days after he was appointed Professor, he undertook an expedition to the island provinces of \u00d6land and Gotland with six students from the university to look for plants useful in medicine. First, they travelled to \u00d6land and stayed there until 21 June, when they sailed to Visby in Gotland. Linnaeus and the students stayed on Gotland for about a month, and then returned to Uppsala. During this expedition, they found 100 previously unrecorded plants. The observations from the expedition were later published in \u00d6l\u00e4ndska och Gothl\u00e4ndska Resa, written in Swedish. Like Flora Lapponica, it contained both zoological and botanical observations, as well as observations concerning the culture in \u00d6land and Gotland.[91][92]/nDuring the summer of 1745, Linnaeus published two more books: Flora Suecica and Fauna Suecica. Flora Suecica was a strictly botanical book, while Fauna Suecica was zoological.[84][93] Anders Celsius had created the temperature scale named after him in 1742. Celsius's scale was inverted compared to today, the boiling point at 0\u00a0\u00b0C and freezing point at 100\u00a0\u00b0C. In 1745, Linnaeus inverted the scale to its present standard.[94]/nIn the summer of 1746, Linnaeus was once again commissioned by the Government to carry out an expedition, this time to the Swedish province of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland. He set out from Uppsala on 12 June and returned on 11 August. On the expedition his primary companion was Erik Gustaf Lidbeck, a student who had accompanied him on his previous journey. Linnaeus described his findings from the expedition in the book W\u00e4stg\u00f6ta-Resa, published the next year.[91][95] After he returned from the journey, the Government decided Linnaeus should take on another expedition to the southernmost province Scania. This journey was postponed, as Linnaeus felt too busy.[84]/nIn 1747, Linnaeus was given the title archiater, or chief physician, by the Swedish king Adolf Frederick\u2014a mark of great respect.[96] The same year he was elected member of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin.[97]/nIn the spring of 1749, Linnaeus could finally journey to Scania, again commissioned by the Government. With him he brought his student, Olof S\u00f6derberg. On the way to Scania, he made his last visit to his brothers and sisters in Stenbrohult since his father had died the previous year. The expedition was similar to the previous journeys in most aspects, but this time he was also ordered to find the best place to grow walnut and Swedish whitebeam trees; these trees were used by the military to make rifles. While there, they also visited the Raml\u00f6sa mineral spa, where he remarked on the quality of its ferruginous water.[98] The journey was successful, and Linnaeus's observations were published the next year in Sk\u00e5nska Resa.[99][100]/nIn 1750, Linnaeus became rector of Uppsala University, starting a period where natural sciences were esteemed.[84] Perhaps the most important contribution he made during his time at Uppsala was to teach; many of his students travelled to various places in the world to collect botanical samples. Linnaeus called the best of these students his \"apostles\".[101] His lectures were normally very popular and were often held in the Botanical Garden. He tried to teach the students to think for themselves and not trust anybody, not even him. Even more popular than the lectures were the botanical excursions made every Saturday during summer, where Linnaeus and his students explored the flora and fauna in the vicinity of Uppsala.[102]/nLinnaeus published Philosophia Botanica in 1751.[103] The book contained a complete survey of the taxonomy system he had been using in his earlier works. It also contained information of how to keep a journal on travels and how to maintain a botanical garden.[104]/nDuring Linnaeus's time it was normal for upper class women to have wet nurses for their babies. Linnaeus joined an ongoing campaign to end this practice in Sweden and promote breast-feeding by mothers. In 1752 Linnaeus published a thesis along with Frederick Lindberg, a physician student,[105] based on their experiences.[106] In the tradition of the period, this dissertation was essentially an idea of the presiding reviewer (prases) expounded upon by the student. Linnaeus's dissertation was translated into French by J. E. Gilibert in 1770 as La Nourrice mar\u00e2tre, ou Dissertation sur les suites funestes du nourrisage merc\u00e9naire. Linnaeus suggested that children might absorb the personality of their wet nurse through the milk. He admired the child care practices of the Lapps[107] and pointed out how healthy their babies were compared to those of Europeans who employed wet nurses. He compared the behaviour of wild animals and pointed out how none of them denied their newborns their breastmilk.[107] It is thought that his activism played a role in his choice of the term Mammalia for the class of organisms.[108]/nLinnaeus published Species Plantarum, the work which is now internationally accepted as the starting point of modern botanical nomenclature, in 1753.[109] The first volume was issued on 24 May, the second volume followed on 16 August of the same year.[note 5][111] The book contained 1,200 pages and was published in two volumes; it described over 7,300 species.[112][113] The same year the king dubbed him knight of the Order of the Polar Star, the first civilian in Sweden to become a knight in this order. He was then seldom seen not wearing the order's insignia.[114]/nLinnaeus felt Uppsala was too noisy and unhealthy, so he bought two farms in 1758: Hammarby and S\u00e4vja. The next year, he bought a neighbouring farm, Edeby. He spent the summers with his family at Hammarby; initially it only had a small one-storey house, but in 1762 a new, larger main building was added.[100][115] In Hammarby, Linnaeus made a garden where he could grow plants that could not be grown in the Botanical Garden in Uppsala. He began constructing a museum on a hill behind Hammarby in 1766, where he moved his library and collection of plants. A fire that destroyed about one third of Uppsala and had threatened his residence there necessitated the move.[116]/nSince the initial release of Systema Naturae in 1735, the book had been expanded and reprinted several times; the tenth edition was released in 1758. This edition established itself as the starting point for zoological nomenclature, the equivalent of Species Plantarum.[112][117]/nThe Swedish King Adolf Frederick granted Linnaeus nobility in 1757, but he was not ennobled until 1761. With his ennoblement, he took the name Carl von Linn\u00e9 (Latinised as Carolus a Linn\u00e9), 'Linn\u00e9' being a shortened and gallicised version of 'Linn\u00e6us', and the German nobiliary particle 'von' signifying his ennoblement.[3] The noble family's coat of arms prominently features a twinflower, one of Linnaeus's favourite plants; it was given the scientific name Linnaea borealis in his honour by Gronovius. The shield in the coat of arms is divided into thirds: red, black and green for the three kingdoms of nature (animal, mineral and vegetable) in Linnaean classification; in the centre is an egg \"to denote Nature, which is continued and perpetuated in ovo.\" At the bottom is a phrase in Latin, borrowed from the Aeneid, which reads \"Famam extendere factis\": we extend our fame by our deeds.[118][119][120] Linnaeus inscribed this personal motto in books that were given to him by friends.[121]/nAfter his ennoblement, Linnaeus continued teaching and writing. His reputation had spread over the world, and he corresponded with many different people. For example, Catherine II of Russia sent him seeds from her country.[122] He also corresponded with Giovanni Antonio Scopoli, \"the Linnaeus of the Austrian Empire\", who was a doctor and a botanist in Idrija, Duchy of Carniola (nowadays Slovenia).[123] Scopoli communicated all of his research, findings, and descriptions (for example of the olm and the dormouse, two little animals hitherto unknown to Linnaeus). Linnaeus greatly respected Scopoli and showed great interest in his work. He named a solanaceous genus, Scopolia, the source of scopolamine, after him, but because of the great distance between them, they never met.[124][125]/nLinnaeus was relieved of his duties in the Royal Swedish Academy of Science in 1763, but continued his work there as usual for more than ten years after.[84] In 1769 he was elected to the American Philosophical Society for his work.[126] He stepped down as rector at Uppsala University in December 1772, mostly due to his declining health.[83][127]/nLinnaeus's last years were troubled by illness. He had had a disease called the Uppsala fever in 1764, but survived due to the care of Ros\u00e9n. He developed sciatica in 1773, and the next year, he had a stroke which partially paralysed him.[128] He had a second stroke in 1776, losing the use of his right side and leaving him bereft of his memory; while still able to admire his own writings, he could not recognise himself as their author.[129][130]/nIn December 1777, he had another stroke which greatly weakened him, and eventually led to his death on 10 January 1778 in Hammarby.[131][127] Despite his desire to be buried in Hammarby, he was buried in Uppsala Cathedral on 22 January.[132][133]/nHis library and collections were left to his widow Sara and their children. Joseph Banks, an eminent botanist, wished to purchase the collection, but his son Carl refused the offer and instead moved the collection to Uppsala. In 1783 Carl died and Sara inherited the collection, having outlived both her husband and son. She tried to sell it to Banks, but he was no longer interested; instead an acquaintance of his agreed to buy the collection. The acquaintance was a 24-year-old medical student, James Edward Smith, who bought the whole collection: 14,000 plants, 3,198 insects, 1,564 shells, about 3,000 letters and 1,600 books. Smith founded the Linnean Society of London five years later.[133][134]/nThe von Linn\u00e9 name ended with his son Carl, who never married.[7] His other son, Johannes, had died aged 3.[135] There are over two hundred descendants of Linnaeus through two of his daughters.[7]/nDuring Linnaeus's time as Professor and Rector of Uppsala University, he taught many devoted students, 17 of whom he called \"apostles\". They were the most promising, most committed students, and all of them made botanical expeditions to various places in the world, often with his help. The amount of this help varied; sometimes he used his influence as Rector to grant his apostles a scholarship or a place on an expedition.[136] To most of the apostles he gave instructions of what to look for on their journeys. Abroad, the apostles collected and organised new plants, animals and minerals according to Linnaeus's system. Most of them also gave some of their collection to Linnaeus when their journey was finished.[137] Thanks to these students, the Linnaean system of taxonomy spread through the world without Linnaeus ever having to travel outside Sweden after his return from Holland.[138] The British botanist William T. Stearn notes, without Linnaeus's new system, it would not have been possible for the apostles to collect and organise so many new specimens.[139] Many of the apostles died during their expeditions./nChristopher T\u00e4rnstr\u00f6m, the first apostle and a 43-year-old pastor with a wife and children, made his journey in 1746. He boarded a Swedish East India Company ship headed for China. T\u00e4rnstr\u00f6m never reached his destination, dying of a tropical fever on C\u00f4n S\u01a1n Island the same year. T\u00e4rnstr\u00f6m's widow blamed Linnaeus for making her children fatherless, causing Linnaeus to prefer sending out younger, unmarried students after T\u00e4rnstr\u00f6m.[140] Six other apostles later died on their expeditions, including Pehr Forssk\u00e5l and Pehr L\u00f6fling.[139]/nTwo years after T\u00e4rnstr\u00f6m's expedition, Finnish-born Pehr Kalm set out as the second apostle to North America. There he spent two-and-a-half years studying the flora and fauna of Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Canada. Linnaeus was overjoyed when Kalm returned, bringing back with him many pressed flowers and seeds. At least 90 of the 700 North American species described in Species Plantarum had been brought back by Kalm.[141]/nDaniel Solander was living in Linnaeus's house during his time as a student in Uppsala. Linnaeus was very fond of him, promising Solander his eldest daughter's hand in marriage. On Linnaeus's recommendation, Solander travelled to England in 1760, where he met the English botanist Joseph Banks. With Banks, Solander joined James Cook on his expedition to Oceania on the Endeavour in 1768\u201371.[142][143] Solander was not the only apostle to journey with James Cook; Anders Sparrman followed on the Resolution in 1772\u201375 bound for, among other places, Oceania and South America. Sparrman made many other expeditions, one of them to South Africa.[144]/nPerhaps the most famous and successful apostle was Carl Peter Thunberg, who embarked on a nine-year expedition in 1770. He stayed in South Africa for three years, then travelled to Japan. All foreigners in Japan were forced to stay on the island of Dejima outside Nagasaki, so it was thus hard for Thunberg to study the flora. He did, however, manage to persuade some of the translators to bring him different plants, and he also found plants in the gardens of Dejima. He returned to Sweden in 1779, one year after Linnaeus's death.[145]/nThe first edition of Systema Naturae was printed in the Netherlands in 1735. It was a twelve-page work.[146] By the time it reached its 10th edition in 1758, it classified 4,400 species of animals and 7,700 species of plants. People from all over the world sent their specimens to Linnaeus to be included. By the time he started work on the 12th edition, Linnaeus needed a new invention\u2014the index card\u2014to track classifications.[147]/nIn Systema Naturae, the unwieldy names mostly used at the time, such as \"Physalis annua ramosissima, ramis angulosis glabris, foliis dentato-serratis\", were supplemented with concise and now familiar \"binomials\", composed of the generic name, followed by a specific epithet\u2014in the case given, Physalis angulata. These binomials could serve as a label to refer to the species. Higher taxa were constructed and arranged in a simple and orderly manner. Although the system, now known as binomial nomenclature, was partially developed by the Bauhin brothers (see Gaspard Bauhin and Johann Bauhin) almost 200 years earlier,[148] Linnaeus was the first to use it consistently throughout the work, including in monospecific genera, and may be said to have popularised it within the scientific community./nAfter the decline in Linnaeus's health in the early 1770s, publication of editions of Systema Naturae went in two different directions. Another Swedish scientist, Johan Andreas Murray issued the Regnum Vegetabile section separately in 1774 as the Systema Vegetabilium, rather confusingly labelled the 13th edition.[149] Meanwhile, a 13th edition of the entire Systema appeared in parts between 1788 and 1793 under the editorship of Johann Friedrich Gmelin. It was through the Systema Vegetabilium that Linnaeus's work became widely known in England, following its translation from the Latin by the Lichfield Botanical Society as A System of Vegetables (1783\u20131785).[150]/n('Opinion of the learned world on the writings of Carl Linnaeus, Doctor') Published in 1740, this small octavo-sized pamphlet was presented to the State Library of New South Wales by the Linnean Society of NSW in 2018. This is considered among the rarest of all the writings of Linnaeus, and crucial to his career, securing him his appointment to a professorship of medicine at Uppsala University. From this position he laid the groundwork for his radical new theory of classifying and naming organisms for which he was considered the founder of modern taxonomy./nSpecies Plantarum (or, more fully, Species Plantarum, exhibentes plantas rite cognitas, ad genera relatas, cum differentiis specificis, nominibus trivialibus, synonymis selectis, locis natalibus, secundum systema sexuale digestas) was first published in 1753, as a two-volume work. Its prime importance is perhaps that it is the primary starting point of plant nomenclature as it exists today.[109]/nGenera plantarum: eorumque characteres naturales secundum numerum, figuram, situm, et proportionem omnium fructificationis partium was first published in 1737, delineating plant genera. Around 10 editions were published, not all of them by Linnaeus himself; the most important is the 1754 fifth edition.[151] In it Linnaeus divided the plant Kingdom into 24 classes. One, Cryptogamia, included all the plants with concealed reproductive parts (algae, fungi, mosses and liverworts and ferns).[152]/nPhilosophia Botanica (1751)[103] was a summary of Linnaeus's thinking on plant classification and nomenclature, and an elaboration of the work he had previously published in Fundamenta Botanica (1736) and Critica Botanica (1737). Other publications forming part of his plan to reform the foundations of botany include his Classes Plantarum and Bibliotheca Botanica: all were printed in Holland (as were Genera Plantarum (1737) and Systema Naturae (1735)), the Philosophia being simultaneously released in Stockholm.[153]/nAt the end of his lifetime the Linnean collection in Uppsala was considered one of the finest collections of natural history objects in Sweden. Next to his own collection he had also built up a museum for the university of Uppsala, which was supplied by material donated by Carl Gyllenborg (in 1744\u20131745), crown-prince Adolf Fredrik (in 1745), Erik Petreus (in 1746), Claes Grill (in 1746), Magnus Lagerstr\u00f6m (in 1748 and 1750) and Jonas Alstr\u00f6mer (in 1749). The relation between the museum and the private collection was not formalised and the steady flow of material from Linnean pupils were incorporated to the private collection rather than to the museum.[154] Linnaeus felt his work was reflecting the harmony of nature and he said in 1754 \"the earth is then nothing else but a museum of the all-wise creator's masterpieces, divided into three chambers\". He had turned his own estate into a microcosm of that 'world museum'.[155]/nIn April 1766 parts of the town were destroyed by a fire and the Linnean private collection was subsequently moved to a barn outside the town, and shortly afterwards to a single-room stone building close to his country house at Hammarby near Uppsala. This resulted in a physical separation between the two collections; the museum collection remained in the botanical garden of the university. Some material which needed special care (alcohol specimens) or ample storage space was moved from the private collection to the museum./nIn Hammarby the Linnean private collections suffered seriously from damp and the depredations by mice and insects. Carl von Linn\u00e9's son (Carl Linnaeus) inherited the collections in 1778 and retained them until his own death in 1783. Shortly after Carl von Linn\u00e9's death his son confirmed that mice had caused \"horrible damage\" to the plants and that also moths and mould had caused considerable damage.[156] He tried to rescue them from the neglect they had suffered during his father's later years, and also added further specimens. This last activity however reduced rather than augmented the scientific value of the original material./nIn 1784 the young medical student James Edward Smith purchased the entire specimen collection, library, manuscripts, and correspondence of Carl Linnaeus from his widow and daughter and transferred the collections to London.[157][158] Not all material in Linn\u00e9's private collection was transported to England. Thirty-three fish specimens preserved in alcohol were not sent and were later lost.[159]/nIn London Smith tended to neglect the zoological parts of the collection; he added some specimens and also gave some specimens away.[160] Over the following centuries the Linnean collection in London suffered enormously at the hands of scientists who studied the collection, and in the process disturbed the original arrangement and labels, added specimens that did not belong to the original series and withdrew precious original type material.[156]/nMuch material which had been intensively studied by Linn\u00e9 in his scientific career belonged to the collection of Queen Lovisa Ulrika (1720\u20131782) (in the Linnean publications referred to as \"Museum Ludovicae Ulricae\" or \"M. L. U.\"). This collection was donated by her grandson King Gustav IV Adolf (1778\u20131837) to the museum in Uppsala in 1804. Another important collection in this respect was that of her husband King Adolf Fredrik (1710\u20131771) (in the Linnean sources known as \"Museum Adolphi Friderici\" or \"Mus. Ad. Fr.\"), the wet parts (alcohol collection) of which were later donated to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and is today housed in the Swedish Museum of Natural History at Stockholm. The dry material was transferred to Uppsala.[154]/nThe establishment of universally accepted conventions for the naming of organisms was Linnaeus's main contribution to taxonomy\u2014his work marks the starting point of consistent use of binomial nomenclature.[161] During the 18th century expansion of natural history knowledge, Linnaeus also developed what became known as the Linnaean taxonomy; the system of scientific classification now widely used in the biological sciences. A previous zoologist Rumphius (1627\u20131702) had more or less approximated the Linnaean system and his material contributed to the later development of the binomial scientific classification by Linnaeus.[162]/nThe Linnaean system classified nature within a nested hierarchy, starting with three kingdoms. Kingdoms were divided into classes and they, in turn, into orders, and thence into genera (singular: genus), which were divided into species (singular: species).[163] Below the rank of species he sometimes recognised taxa of a lower (unnamed) rank; these have since acquired standardised names such as variety in botany and subspecies in zoology. Modern taxonomy includes a rank of family between order and genus and a rank of phylum between kingdom and class that were not present in Linnaeus's original system.[164]/nLinnaeus's groupings were based upon shared physical characteristics, and not based upon differences.[164] Of his higher groupings, only those for animals are still in use, and the groupings themselves have been significantly changed since their conception, as have the principles behind them. Nevertheless, Linnaeus is credited with establishing the idea of a hierarchical structure of classification which is based upon observable characteristics and intended to reflect natural relationships.[161][165] While the underlying details concerning what are considered to be scientifically valid \"observable characteristics\" have changed with expanding knowledge (for example, DNA sequencing, unavailable in Linnaeus's time, has proven to be a tool of considerable utility for classifying living organisms and establishing their evolutionary relationships), the fundamental principle remains sound./nLinnaeus's system of taxonomy was especially noted as the first to include humans (Homo) taxonomically grouped with apes (Simia), under the header of Anthropomorpha.\nGerman biologist Ernst Haeckel speaking in 1907 noted this as the \"most important sign of Linnaeus's genius\".[166]/nLinnaeus classified humans among the primates beginning with the first edition of Systema Naturae.[167] During his time at Hartekamp, he had the opportunity to examine several monkeys and noted similarities between them and man.[168] He pointed out both species basically have the same anatomy; except for speech, he found no other differences.[169][note 6] Thus he placed man and monkeys under the same category, Anthropomorpha, meaning \"manlike.\"[170] This classification received criticism from other biologists such as Johan Gottschalk Wallerius, Jacob Theodor Klein and Johann Georg Gmelin on the ground that it is illogical to describe man as human-like.[171] In a letter to Gmelin from 1747, Linnaeus replied:[172][note 7]/nIt does not please [you] that I've placed Man among the Anthropomorpha, perhaps because of the term 'with human form',[note 8] but man learns to know himself. Let's not quibble over words. It will be the same to me whatever name we apply. But I seek from you and from the whole world a generic difference between man and simian that [follows] from the principles of Natural History.[note 9] I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me. Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline./nThe theological concerns were twofold: first, putting man at the same level as monkeys or apes would lower the spiritually higher position that man was assumed to have in the great chain of being, and second, because the Bible says man was created in the image of God[173] (theomorphism), if monkeys/apes and humans were not distinctly and separately designed, that would mean monkeys and apes were created in the image of God as well. This was something many could not accept.[174] The conflict between world views that was caused by asserting man was a type of animal would simmer for a century until the much greater, and still ongoing, creation\u2013evolution controversy began in earnest with the publication of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin in 1859./nAfter such criticism, Linnaeus felt he needed to explain himself more clearly. The 10th edition of Systema Naturae introduced new terms, including Mammalia and Primates, the latter of which would replace Anthropomorpha[175] as well as giving humans the full binomial Homo sapiens.[176] The new classification received less criticism, but many natural historians still believed he had demoted humans from their former place of ruling over nature and not being a part of it. Linnaeus believed that man biologically belongs to the animal kingdom and had to be included in it.[177] In his book Dieta Naturalis, he said, \"One should not vent one's wrath on animals, Theology decree that man has a soul and that the animals are mere 'automata mechanica,' but I believe they would be better advised that animals have a soul and that the difference is of nobility.\"[178]/n/nLinnaeus added a second species to the genus Homo in Systema Naturae based on a figure and description by Jacobus Bontius from a 1658 publication: Homo troglodytes (\"caveman\")[180][181] and published a third in 1771: Homo lar.[182] Swedish historian Gunnar Broberg states that the new human species Linnaeus described were actually simians or native people clad in skins to frighten colonial settlers, whose appearance had been exaggerated in accounts to Linnaeus.[183] For Homo troglodytes Linnaeus asked the Swedish East India Company to search for one, but they did not find any signs of its existence.[184] Homo lar has since been reclassified as Hylobates lar, the lar gibbon.[185]/n/nIn the first edition of Systema Naturae, Linnaeus subdivided the human species into four varieties: \"Europ\u00e6us albesc[ens]\" (whitish European), \"Americanus rubesc[ens]\" (reddish American), \"Asiaticus fuscus\" (tawny Asian) and \"Africanus nigr[iculus]\" (blackish African).[186][187]\nIn the tenth edition of Systema Naturae he further detailed phenotypical characteristics for each variety, based on the concept of the four temperaments from classical antiquity,[188][dubious  \u2013 discuss] and changed the description of Asians' skin tone to \"luridus\" (yellow).[189] While Linnaeus believed that these varieties resulted from environmental differences between the four known continents,[190] the Linnean Society acknowledges that his categorization's focus on skin color and later inclusion of cultural and behavioral traits cemented colonial stereotypes and provided the foundations for scientific racism.[191] Additionally, Linnaeus created a wastebasket taxon \"monstrosus\" for \"wild and monstrous humans, unknown groups, and more or less abnormal people\".[192]/nIn 1959, W. T. Stearn designated Linnaeus to be the lectotype of H. sapiens.[193][194][195]/nLinnaeus's applied science was inspired not only by the instrumental utilitarianism general to the early Enlightenment, but also by his adherence to the older economic doctrine of Cameralism.[196] Additionally, Linnaeus was a state interventionist. He supported tariffs, levies, export bounties, quotas, embargoes, navigation acts, subsidised investment capital, ceilings on wages, cash grants, state-licensed producer monopolies, and cartels.[197]/nAnniversaries of Linnaeus's birth, especially in centennial years, have been marked by major celebrations.[198] Linnaeus has appeared on numerous Swedish postage stamps and banknotes.[198] There are numerous statues of Linnaeus in countries around the world. The Linnean Society of London has awarded the Linnean Medal for excellence in botany or zoology since 1888. Following approval by the Riksdag of Sweden, V\u00e4xj\u00f6 University and Kalmar College merged on 1 January 2010 to become Linnaeus University.[199] Other things named after Linnaeus include the twinflower genus Linnaea, Linnaeosicyos (a monotypic genus in the family Cucurbitaceae),[200] the crater Linn\u00e9 on the Earth's moon, a street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the cobalt sulfide mineral Linnaeite./nAndrew Dickson White wrote in A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom (1896):/nLinnaeus\u00a0... was the most eminent naturalist of his time, a wide observer, a close thinker; but the atmosphere in which he lived and moved and had his being was saturated with biblical theology, and this permeated all his thinking.\u00a0... Toward the end of his life he timidly advanced the hypothesis that all the species of one genus constituted at the creation one species; and from the last edition of his Systema Natur\u00e6 he quietly left out the strongly orthodox statement of the fixity of each species, which he had insisted upon in his earlier works.\u00a0... warnings came speedily both from the Catholic and Protestant sides.[201]/nThe mathematical PageRank algorithm, applied to 24 multilingual Wikipedia editions in 2014, published in PLOS ONE in 2015, placed Carl Linnaeus at the top historical figure, above Jesus, Aristotle, Napoleon, and Adolf Hitler (in that order).[202][203]/nIn the 21st century, Linn\u00e6us's taxonomy of human \"races\" has been problematised and discussed. Some critics claim that Linn\u00e6us was one of the forebears of the modern pseudoscientific notion of scientific racism, while others hold the view that while his classification was stereotyped, it did not imply that certain human \"races\" were superior to others.[204][205][206][207][208]/nThe greater number of naturalists who have taken into consideration the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under the title of the Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head./nBiographies/nResources/nOther", "61052021": "Mary Morgan-Richards is a New Zealand biologist, and as of 2019 is a full professor at Massey University.[1]/nIn 1995, Morgan-Richard's completed a PhD thesis titled  'Weta Karyotypes: the Systematic Significance of Their Variation'  at the Victoria University of Wellington.

According to Bauer, living systems function in the expense of non-equilibrium, and the external energy is used not directly to perform work but to support the stable non-equilibrium state. Bauer's principle is incorporated into non-linear thermodynamics of irreversible processes.[4] Living systems in this framework cannot support their organization only due to the influx of external energy, i.e. the ordering internal factor is involved. The activity of living system is fully determined by the internal pattern of its non-equilibrium state and any work performed by the biological system appears as the work of its structural forces. The process of evolution, according to Bauer, corresponds to the increase in external work, which aims to exploit additional resources to maintain living state of evolving biosystems.[1]/n/nThis Hungarian biographical article is a stub.

He wrote many academic works describing his work, including a textbook on early animal development.[5]/nDavidson began conducting research as a teenager at The Marine Biological Laboratory.[6]  After graduating from high school, he matriculated to the University of Pennsylvania and graduated with a B.A. in biology in 1958.[7]  Davidson's Ph.D. work entailed studying RNA synthesis and gene expression in early development of the anuran Xenopus laevis in the lab of Alfred Mirsky at Rockefeller University.[8] Davidson returned to the Marine Biological Laboratory to serve for two terms as Director or Co-Director of the Embryology Course, from 1988 through 1996.[9]/nAfter obtaining his Ph.D., Davidson stayed on at Rockefeller first as a research associate and then as an assistant professor.  In 1971, he moved to the California Institute of Technology as an associate professor.  There, Davidson took an interest in development of marine invertebrates, especially of the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, and in investigating the function of genomic repetitive DNA elements, both interests of which would lead to a long line of investigation that eventually led to his contemporary interest in gene regulatory networks.[10]/nDavidson has spent the majority of his scientific career investigating the molecular and mechanistic basis of animal development, i.e. how animals are built by reading the instructions encoded in the egg and, ultimately, in the genome.  While at Rockefeller and very early in his career, he and Roy Britten, then at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, speculated on how the products of transcription, e.g. various RNAs or other downstream products, would need to in principle interact in order for cellular differentiation and gene regulation to occur in multicellular organisms.[11]  This research program eventually led him to investigations regarding the role of gene regulation in cell lineage and embryonic territory specification, both endeavors of which contributed substantially to many biological disciplines, including developmental biology, systems biology and evolutionary developmental biology.

Monchadsky on the identification of immature Ixodes hard ticks and the taxonomy of ticks in general. She died in St Petersburg in 2018.[1][2]/nFilippova specialised in acarology, the study of ticks and mites that carry diseases between humans such as typhus and Lyme disease.[1] In 1955 she moved to the Zoological Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in Leningrad, where she worked for over 60 years. She began work that led to a monograph about the argasid ticks of the Palearctic region published in 1966 in the Fauna of the USSR academic series.[1] She undertook field work throughout the Soviet Union until the 1990s, rearing ticks in the laboratory in order to study all their behaviour and developmental stages. Her work on the Ixodes genus led to taxonomic revisions. She focused especially on Ixodes persulcatus and closely related species, not only from a taxonomic perspective but their role in transmitting the agent of Lyme disease. This led to the concept of the persulcatus group. She acted as editor-in-chief for a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization monograph on this group in the international programme Man and the Biosphere.[2] Later in her career she applied scanning electron microscopy to the analysis of the shape of ticks.[1]/nFilippova was the author or co-author of three monographs as well as over 130 scientific publications and conference articles.[1][3] They include:/nShe published descriptions of 11 new species of ticks (Anomalohimalaya lotozkyi, Argas latus, Argas macrostigmatus, Argas tridentatus, Argas vulgaris, Dermacentor montanus, Dermacentor ushakovae, Ixodes ghilarovi, Ixodes sachalinensis, Ixodes stromi and Ixodes subterranus) as well as identifying new areas where previously known ticks could be found.[1]/nIn 1993 Filippova received the E.N.

In 2014, Takahashi was named by British science journal Nature as one of \"five to watch\" global scientists for her groundbreaking work in regenerative medicine.[1]/nIn March 2017 a team led by Takahashi completed the first successful transplant of iPS-derived retinal cells into the eye of a patient suffering from advanced wet age-related macular degeneration.[2] During the surgery the patient received a transplant of approximately 250,000 retinal pigment epithelial cells into the eye generated from donor-derived iPSCs. Results of this landmark study were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.[3]/nTakahashi was born in Osaka Japan in 1961. After graduating from the Faculty of Medicine at Kyoto University in 1986 and obtaining a PhD specializing in visual pathology at the same university in 1992, Takahashi's clinical and research work has focused on ophthalmology and retinal diseases. She chose ophthalmology as her specialty because she wanted to have a family and thought the discipline would help her best balance work and life. In 1995 Takahashi commenced post-doctoral research at the Salk Institute's Laboratory of Genetics. There she was fascinated by the chances of using stem cells for eye diseases and retinal therapy. Since 2001 she has served as an associate professor at the translational research center./nIn September 2014, her and her team at the Riken Institute\u2019s center for developmental biology in Kobe succeeded in a world-first transplanting of cells made from induced pluripotent stem cells into a human body. The operation was conducted as a clinical study and involved creating a retinal sheet from iPS cells, which were developed by Shinya Yamanaka. iPS cells are created by removing mature cells from an individual and reprogramming these cells back to an embryonic state. The retinal sheet was transplanted into a female patient in her 70s with age related macular degeneration (AMD), an eye complication that blurs the central field of vision and can progress into blindness. The iPS cells were hoped to stop the progression of AMD. Her and her research team used iPS cells made from the patient\u2019s own skin cells. Then in March she and her team carried out the world\u2019s first transplant of retinal cells created from donor iPS cells. Time and cost used in the surgery has been significantly reduced by using super donor cells, cells derived from people with special white blood cell types that aren\u2019t rejected by the immune systems of receiving patients./nIn 2015 Takahashi was awarded the Ogawa-Yamanaka Prize in Stem Cell Biology.[4]  Nature Magazine named her as one of five \u201cscientists to watch in 2014\u201d and nominated her as one of ten \u201cpeople who mattered in 2014\u201d./nMany challenges remain however to advance the technology and make it commercially available. One of the issues is the high cost and it is estimated that could take until around 2019 before the cost of the IPS treatment for AMD will is below \u00a510 million ($95,500)[5] The procedure is expected to set the path for more applications of IPS-cell technology, which offers the versatility of embryonic cells without their ethical talent.[6] The future of IPSC therapy looks promising and regenerative medicine will likely become a big field in the future. IPSCs and ESCs have the potential to industrialize the cell therapy field because they can be expanded so that more cells can be made for many patients.[7] Also photoreceptor transplantation along with IPS derived cells is to be expected within five years which should not only slow AMD but could possibly even restore some vision.[8] In addition, the effect of regenerative medicine will not depend on the donors cells but depend on the host condition and the surgery skill.[9]", "26907826": "Takuji Iwasaki (\u5ca9\u5d0e \u5353\u723e, Iwasaki Takuji, November 17, 1869 \u2013 May 2, 1937) was a Japanese meteorologist, biologist, ethnologist historian. He was a meteorologist at the Ishigaki Weather Station, Ishigaki, Okinawa Prefecture.

Takuji was stationed at the Ishigaki Weather Observatory (now Ishigaki Weather Station) in the Yaeyama Islands 1899 when he married. In 1900, he became the second director of the observatory, and had remained in Ishigaki until his death./nWhile he was stationed at the observatory in Ishigaki, Takuji studied various unrelated fields including society, traditions, and natural sciences related to Ishigaki. He became the director of Yaeyama Library, which later became the Yaeyama branch of the Okinawa Prefectural Library. He started the first kindergarten on the island, and took part in a venture enterprise of culturing black pearls in Kabira Bay with Mikimoto K\u014dkichi. One of Takuji's weaknesses was language. He only spoke a Sendai dialect, and up until his death, conversation with local people was very difficult./nIn 1932, Takuji retired from the Ishigaki Observatory but remained as a part-time worker. Then living in Tonoshiro, Ishigaki, he named his house \"Fukurokaze Soh\". He died there on May 2, 1937, at the age of 69./nIn 2001, Takuji was made an honorary citizen of Ishigaki./nTakuji proposed that all buildings in typhoon-prone Ishigaki Island be built in concrete, including his observatory. This became a reality in 1915, and now almost all buildings in Ishigaki are erected in concrete. He observed every typhoon which hit Ishigaki Island, and during one storm in 1914, a small stone hit his right eye and he lost his sight in that eye./nTakuji has been famous for his studies in the fields of biology.

He subsequently attended the New York University College of Medicine. After a year as an intern at Long Island College Hospital, he served two years in the Army Medical Corps./nGross believed that clues to diseases such as rheumatic fever would be found in the molecular structure and biology of connective tissue. He returned to M.I.T. to join the laboratory of Francis O. Schmitt as a Research Associate, where he began research on structural macromolecules utilizing chemical and electron microscopical methods. Despite many important observations on hyaluronic acid and elastin, he chose to focus on collagen./nHe was attracted to Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts General Hospital by Walter Bauer, who thought that many of the secrets of rheumatoid arthritis and rheumatic fever could be uncovered by similar methods. Gross's pioneering findings that collagen molecules could be extracted from tissues using solutions of neutral salt or dilute acid and reconstituted into various structures opened up the field of collagen research./nGross then began to study collagen structure in animal models of human wound healing. In the late 1950s, he became interested in lathyrism and, with Charles Levene, made the critical observations that lathyrism resulted from abnormal aggregation and defective cross-linking of collagen molecules. Alongside his collaborators, Karl Piez and George Martin at the National Institute of Health, Gross discovered that collagen was composed of three polypeptide chains. These experiments opened up the field of collagen biology./nIn the early 1960s, Gross began searching for mechanisms whereby collagen fibers are degraded during tissue remodeling alongside Belgian postdoctoral fellow Charles Lapiere. Gross reasoned that collagenolytic enzymes, which previously had been identified only in bacteria, could be made only when and where they were needed. They looked for collagenase in the medium from tissue implants in culture. Together, they found the enzyme and characterized its mechanism of action and its unique cleavage site./nWith such colleagues as Martin Tanzer, Utaka Nagai, Andrew Kang, and others, Gross continued studies of mechanisms of collagenolysis, lathyrism, and wound healing.

Veley, was a British biologist mainly known for her studies of microorganisms in liquor. She was one of the first women admitted to the Linnaean Society. Apart from her scientific work, she was one of the first European breeders of Siamese cats./nLilian Jane Gould was born on 19 February 1861, to Katharine Emma Gould and the Rev. J. Nutcombe. She attended Somerville College, Oxford on a scholarship, where her adviser was the entomologist Edward Bagnall Poulton.[1] In 1894 she obtained a First Class degree in Natural Sciences, with a specialisation in animal morphology.[1] In 1895 she married Victor Herbert Veley (1856\u20131933), a scientist and businessman with whom she would later collaborate on several research projects.[2][3] Like other Oxford University women scientists of the era who were barred from obtaining a doctorate at Oxford, she later received a D.Sc. degree from Trinity College, Dublin (1905).[4][5]/nIn 1904, she became one of the first women elected to the Linnean Society of London.[6]/nDuring World War I, Gould served as the commandant of a London unit of the British Red Cross.[1]/nHer husband died in 1933 and Gould died on 2 December 1936.[3] An obituary was published in the Proceedings of the Linnaean Society.[7]/nGould wrote her first two scientific papers while still at Oxford University; one was on colour in the larvae of lepidoptera, while the other was on an amoeba, Pelomyxa palustris.[1]/nVeley was a scientist and the director of the Baddow Brewery Company, and Gould worked with him on microorganisms found in liquors such as rum.[3] With Veley, she published several brief papers on the subject in Nature and elsewhere, as well as a book entitled The Micro-Organism of Faulty Rum (1898).[1][8] Her husband's obituary opined that the book had received less attention than it deserved.[3]/nGould also played a part in the early history of the modern breed of Siamese cat, becoming one of the first western Siamese breeders. In 1884, her brother Edward, who was Consul-General in Bangkok, brought a breeding pair of the cats back home as a gift for his sister. Gould's pair, named Pho and Mia, produced three Siamese kittens, and all five attracted attention the following year at the annual cat show at London's Crystal Palace. Gould would go on to co-found the Siamese Cat Club in 1901.[9][10]/nSome photographs of other types of cats owned by Gould are held in the UK National Archives.[11][12] She also interviewed in 1910 a family in Putney who owned a cat claimed to have been stolen from a Japanese temple of which cats were traditional guards.[13]", "38262": "Max Ferdinand Perutz OM CH CBE FRS (19 May 1914 \u2013 6 February 2002)[4] was an Austrian-born British molecular biologist, who shared the 1962 Nobel Prize for Chemistry with John Kendrew, for their studies of the structures of haemoglobin and myoglobin. He went on to win the Royal Medal of the Royal Society in 1971 and the Copley Medal in 1979.  At Cambridge he founded and chaired (1962\u201379) The MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB), fourteen of whose scientists have won Nobel Prizes./nPerutz was born in Vienna, the son of Adele \"Dely\" (Goldschmidt) and Hugo Perutz, a textile manufacturer.[5] His parents were Jewish by ancestry, but had baptised Perutz in the Catholic religion.[6] Although Perutz rejected religion and was an atheist in his later years, he was against offending others for their religious beliefs.[7]/nHis parents hoped that he would become a lawyer, but he became interested in chemistry while at school. Overcoming his parents' objections he enrolled as a chemistry undergraduate at the University of Vienna and completed his degree in 1936. Made aware by lecturer Fritz von Wessely of the advances being undertaken at the University of Cambridge into biochemistry by a team led by Gowland Hopkins, he asked Professor Mark, who was soon to visit Cambridge, to make inquiries of Hopkins about whether there would be a place for him. Mark forgot, but had visited J.D. Bernal, who was looking for a research student to assist him with studies into X-ray crystallography.[8] Perutz was dismayed as he knew nothing about the subject. Mark countered by saying that he would soon learn. Bernal accepted him as a research student in his crystallography research group at the Cavendish Laboratory. His father had deposited \u00a3500 with his London agent to support him. He learnt quickly. Bernal encouraged him to use the X-ray diffraction method to study the structure of proteins. As protein crystals were difficult to obtain, he used horse haemoglobin crystals, and began his doctoral thesis on its structure. Haemoglobin was a subject which was to occupy him for most of his professional career. He completed his Ph.D. under Lawrence Bragg in 1940.[9]/nHe applied to Kings and St. John's colleges, and became a member of Peterhouse, on the basis that it served the best food. He was elected an Honorary Fellow of Peterhouse in 1962. He took a keen interest in the Junior Members, and was a regular and popular speaker at the Kelvin Club, the College's scientific society./nWhen Hitler took over Austria in 1938, Perutz's parents managed to escape to Switzerland, but they had lost all of their money. As a result, Perutz lost their financial support. With his ability to ski, experience in mountaineering since childhood and his knowledge of crystals, Perutz was accepted as a member of a three-man team to study the conversion of snow into ice in Swiss glaciers in the summer of 1938. His resulting article for the Proceedings of the Royal Society made him known as an expert on glaciers.[10]/nLawrence Bragg, who was Professor of Experimental Physics at the Cavendish, thought that Perutz's research into haemoglobin had promise and encouraged him to apply for a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to continue his research. The application was accepted in January 1939 and with the money Perutz was able to bring his parents from Switzerland to England in March 1939.[10]/nOn the outbreak of World War II, Perutz was rounded up along with other persons of German or Austrian background, and sent to Newfoundland (on orders from Winston Churchill).[11] After being interned for several months he returned to Cambridge.  \nBecause of his pre-War research into the changes in the arrangement of the crystals in the layers of a glacier, he was asked for advice on whether if a battalion of commandos were landed in Norway, could they be hidden in shelters under glaciers. His knowledge on the subject of ice then led to him being recruited for Project Habakkuk in 1942. This was a secret project to build an ice platform in the mid-Atlantic, which could be used to refuel aircraft. To that end he investigated the recently invented mixture of ice and woodpulp known as pykrete. He carried out early experiments on pykrete in a secret location underneath Smithfield Meat Market in the City of London./nAfter the War he returned briefly to glaciology, demonstrating how glaciers flow.[12]/nIn 1947, Perutz, with the support of Professor Bragg, was successful in obtaining support from the Medical Research Council (MRC) to undertake research into the molecular structure of biological systems. This financial support allowed him to establish the Molecular Biology Unit at the Cavendish Laboratory.[13] Perutz's new unit attracted researchers who realised that the field of molecular biology had great promise; among them were Francis Crick in 1949 and James D. Watson in 1951./nIn 1953, Perutz showed that diffracted X-rays from protein crystals could be phased by comparing the patterns from crystals of the protein with and without heavy atoms attached. In 1959 he employed this method to determine the molecular structure of the protein haemoglobin, which transports oxygen in the blood.[14] This work resulted in his sharing with John Kendrew the 1962 Nobel Prize for Chemistry. Nowadays the molecular structures of several thousand proteins are determined by X-ray crystallography every year.[citation needed]/nAfter 1959, Perutz and his colleagues went on to determine the structure of oxy- and deoxy- haemoglobin at high resolution. As a result, in 1970, he was at last able to suggest how it works as a molecular machine: how it switches between its deoxygenated and its oxygenated states, in turn triggering the uptake of oxygen and then its release to the muscles and other organs. Further work over the next two decades refined and corroborated the proposed mechanism. In addition Perutz studied the structural changes in a number of haemoglobin diseases and how these might affect oxygen binding. He hoped that the molecule could be made to function as a drug receptor and that it would be possible to inhibit or reverse the genetic errors such as those that occur in sickle cell anaemia. A further interest was the variation of the haemoglobin molecule from species to species to suit differing habitats and patterns of behaviour. In his final years Perutz turned to the study of changes in protein structures implicated in Huntington and other neurodegenerative diseases. He demonstrated that the onset of Huntington disease is related to the number of glutamine repeats as they bind to form what he called a \"polar zipper\".[15]/nDuring the early 1950s, while Watson and Crick were trying to determine the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), they were given by Perutz an unpublished 1952 progress report for the King's College laboratory of Sir John Randall. This report contained X-ray diffraction images taken by Rosalind Franklin that proved to be crucial in coming to the double-helix structure./nPerutz did this without Franklin's knowledge or permission, and before she had a chance to publish a detailed analysis of the content of her unpublished progress report. Later this action was criticised by Randall and others, in view of the results and the honours resulting from this \"gift\"./nIn an effort to clarify this issue, Perutz later published the report, arguing that it included nothing that Franklin had not said in a talk she gave in late 1951, which Watson had attended. Perutz also added that the report was addressed to an MRC committee created to \"establish contact between the different groups of people working for the Council\". Randall's and Perutz's labs were both funded by the MRC./nIn his later years, Perutz was a regular reviewer/essayist for The New York Review of Books on biomedical subjects. Many of these essays are reprinted in his 1998 book, I wish I had made you angry earlier.[16]/nIn August 1985, The New Yorker published his account of his experiences as an internee during World War II, titled \"That Was the War: Enemy Alien\"./nPerutz won the Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science in 1997.[17]/nA collection of Perutz's correspondence was published posthumously in 2009, titled What a Time I Am Having: Selected Letters of Max Perutz./nPerutz attacked the theories of philosophers Sir Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn and biologist Richard Dawkins in a lecture given at Cambridge on 'Living Molecules' in 1994. He criticised Popper's notion that science progresses through a process of hypothesis formation and refutation, saying that hypotheses are not necessarily the basis of scientific research and, in molecular biology at least, they are not necessarily subject to revision either. For Perutz, Kuhn's notion that science advances in paradigm shifts that are subject to social and cultural pressures is an unfair representation of modern science./nThese criticisms extended to scientists who attack religion, in particular to Dawkins. Statements which offend people's religious faith were for Perutz tactless and simply damage the reputation of science, though he did not criticize scientists opposing \"demonstrably false\" theories such as creationism. He concluded that \"even if we do not believe in God, we should try to live as though we did.\"[18]/nWithin days of the 11 September attacks in 2001, Perutz wrote to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, appealing to him to not respond with military force: \"I am alarmed by the American cries for vengeance and concerned that President Bush's retaliation will lead to the death of thousands more innocent people, driving us into a world of escalating terror and counter-terror. I do hope that you can use your restraining influence to prevent this happening.\"[19]/nPerutz was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1954.[4] In addition to the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1962, which he shared with John Kendrew for their respective studies of the structures of haemoglobin and myoglobin,[20] Max Perutz received a number of other important honours: he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1963, elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences that same year,[21] received the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art in 1967, was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1968,[22] elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1970,[23] received the Royal Medal of the Royal Society in 1971, appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1975, received the Copley Medal in 1979 and became a Member of the Order of Merit in 1988./nPerutz was made a Member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina in 1964, received an Honorary doctorate from the University of Vienna (1965) and received the Wilhelm Exner Medal in 1967.[24] He was elected to EMBO Membership in 1964.[1]/nThe European Crystallographic Association established the Max Perutz Prize, named in his honour.[citation needed]/nIn 1980, Perutz was invited to deliver one of the six lectures for the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures on The Chicken, the Egg and the Molecules.[25]/nIn 1942, Perutz married Gisela Clara Mathilde Peiser (1915\u20132005), a medical photographer. They had two children, Vivien (b. 1944), an art historian; and Robin (b. 1949), a professor of Chemistry at the University of York. Gisela was a refugee from Germany (she was a Protestant whose own father had been born Jewish).[26]/nHe died on 6 February 2002 and his ashes were interred with his parents Hugo Perutz and Dely Perutz in the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge.[27] Gisela died on 17 December 2005 and her ashes were interred in the same grave.[citation needed]", "1578359": "James G.

These principles of teratology were put forth by Jim Wilson in 1959 and in his monograph Environment and Birth Defects.[8] These principles guide the study and understanding of teratogenic agents and their effects on developing organisms:/nSusceptibility to teratogenesis depends on the genotype of the conceptus and the manner in which this interacts with adverse environmental factors./nSusceptibility to teratogenesis varies with the developmental stage at the time of exposure to an adverse influence. There are critical periods of susceptibility to agents and organ systems affected by these agents./nTeratogenic agents act in specific ways on developing cells and tissues to initiate sequences of abnormal developmental events./nThe access of adverse influences to developing tissues depends on the nature of the influence. Several factors affect the ability of a teratogen to contact a developing conceptus, such as the nature of the agent itself, route and degree of maternal exposure, rate of placental transfer and systemic absorption, and composition of the maternal and embryonic/fetal genotypes./nThere are four manifestations of deviant development (Death, Malformation, Growth Retardation and Functional Defect)./nManifestations of deviant development increase in frequency and degree as dosage increases from the No Observable Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) to a dose producing 100% Lethality (LD100)./nThe James G.

From 1994 to 1995, he was a research assistant in the Flow Cytometry Department of the Alabama Reference Lab in Montgomery, Alabama.[9] From 1997 to 2000, he worked at the Emory University Department of Microbiology and Immunology and in the Vaccine Research Center at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta, Georgia.[9]/nFrom 1998 to 2002, Bright worked at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, in the Influenza Branch, Immunology and Viral Pathogenesis Section, where he studied Influenza A virus subtype H5N1.[9] From 2002 to 2003, he shifted to working at the pharmaceutical company, Altea Therapeutics (a subsidiary of Nitto Denko) in Atlanta, Georgia, where he was a senior research scientist in their Vaccine and Immunology Programs.[9][13] In 2003, he rejoined the CDC as an immunologist/virologist in their Disease Control and Prevention, Influenza Division,\nStrain Surveillance Branch in Atlanta, working on their influenza antiviral drug program and focusing on avian influenza. He held that position until 2006.[9][14]/nFrom 2006 to 2008, Bright returned to working in the private sector of the biotechnology industry at Novavax in Maryland, where he was vice president of their global influenza programs as well as of their vaccine research and development. For his work there, he was an adviser to the WHO and the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and became the recipient of the prestigious Charles C. Shepard Science Award for Scientific Excellence, jointly awarded by the CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO).[15] During that time, he also participated in WHO committees on vaccine development and pandemic preparedness.[9][13][16][17]/nIn February 2008, Bright worked at the non-profit PATH on a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation grant funded project as the director in vaccine manufacturing capacity building in Viet Nam. He was also the scientific director of the influenza vaccine project as well as the global vaccine development program, a position he held until October 2010.[9]/nIn 2010, Bright joined the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) governmental agency Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). He was the program lead of BARDA International Programs, then in June 2011 became acting chief of the influenza antiviral drug advanced development program, a position he held until December 2011. From June 2011 to December 2015, he was both deputy director and acting director of BARDA's Influenza and Emerging Diseases Division, eventually serving as director of the division from December 2014 to November 2016. From February 2016 to November 2016, he was an incident commander in the ASPR/BARDA Zika Response.[9][18]/nOn November 15, 2016, after a competitive selection process, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) director Nicki Lurie appointed Bright to the position of director of BARDA.[12][19][20] He succeeded founding director Robin Robinson. In addition to his role as director of BARDA, he was also deputy assistant secretary for Preparedness and Response in the ASPR.[16][21]/nOn October 29, 2019, two months prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Bright participated in a meeting titled \"Universal Flu Vaccine\" at the Milken Institute School of Public Health with other government officials, including Anthony Fauci. The meeting discussed a perceived need to \"blow up the system\" in-order to bypass regulatory control on mRNA vaccines. Participants also discussed the need to create an \"aura of excitement\" and \"make influenza sexy\" in order to revive government funding and drive production of mRNA vaccines, which Bright and others considered superior to \"traditional egg-based vaccines\".[22]/nOn April 20, 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Bright was reassigned to the National Institutes of Health.[23] An HHS spokesperson said Bright's new role would be to help \"accelerate the development and deployment of novel point-of-care testing platforms\".[24] Bright challenged his transfer, stating that it was retaliation his insistence that the government address the pandemic by investing the billions of dollars allocated by Congress for that purpose in supplies and \"safe and scientifically vetted solutions, and not in drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit.\" He said such unproven drugs were being promoted by individuals with political connections and that he resisted these endeavors, which he called \"cronyism.\"[25]/nAmong these complaints, Bright objected to providing additional federal funding to Ridgeback Biotherapeutics to further develop molnupiravir into a treatment for COVID-19.  He argued that although the drug had shown potential against coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, it had already received substantial government support.[26] Bright also wanted to see more safety data for molnupiravir before final sign-off, due to the fact that some other nucleoside analogue drugs had caused birth defects in animal studies.[26][27]/nIn his complaint, he asked to be reinstated as director at BARDA, accusing the Trump administration of removing him from his position and demoting him to an NIH post in retaliation for his warnings about the virus and his opposition to off-label use of hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug that was promoted by President Donald Trump and his supporters as a potential miracle drug for COVID-19, but which increased mortality in subjects.[28] Bright characterized his transfer as a retaliatory demotion and asked the HHS Inspector General to investigate it.[28] On October 6 Bright resigned from the federal government.[2]/nOn November 9, President-elect Joe Biden named Bright to be one of the 13 members of his coronavirus task force.[7][29]/nIn March 2021 he was hired by the Rockefeller Foundation as Senior Vice President of Pandemic Prevention and Response. His assignment is to \"lead the Foundation\u2019s work to collaborate with leading global public health emergency organizations and entities to develop a pandemic prevention institute that aims to avert future pandemics by identifying and responding to the earliest alerts of a disease outbreak and stopping it in the first 100 days.\"[30]/nOn May 5, 2020,[31] Bright filed a whistleblower complaint (\"Complaint of Prohibited Personnel Practice and Other Prohibited Activity\") against the HHS in the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency that protects whistleblowers.[2][20][32] The complaint included accompanying exhibits,[33] only some of which have become public.[34] Bright suggested that the administration prioritized \"cronyism over science\" and that he had been pressured to let politics drive decisions rather than science.[28][35][36][37][38][39]/nIn his complaint, Bright also noted the dangers in pursuing EIDD-2801 (now marketed under the tradename Molnupiravir), an oral antiviral candidate previously supported by NIAID led by Dr. Anthony Fauci and DOD.[40]  Later in May, pharmaceutical giant Merck announced plans to develop the drug.[41][42]  In February 2021, Bright co-authored an opinion editorial in the Washington Post claiming \"efforts to develop a therapeutics were slow and limited.\" The editorial stressed the need for orally administered therapeutics and emphasized the need for non-advanced therapeutic development.[43]/nOn May 7, 2020, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel determined that there were \"reasonable grounds to believe\" that the Trump administration's HHS had unlawfully retaliated against Bright, in violation of the Whistleblower Protection Act, \"because he made protected disclosures in the best interest of the American public.\" The office recommended that he be reinstated as head of BARDA while the investigation is undertaken.[32] However, the recommendation was not binding on HHS,[2][32] and he was not reinstated.[2]/nIn written testimony at a May 14, 2020, hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Health Subcommittee (issued the previous day), Bright warned that \"the darkest winter in modern history\" could come in 2020 if the country failed to undertake a vigorous response to fight the virus: \"Our window of opportunity is closing. If we fail to develop a national coordinated response, based in science, I fear the pandemic will get far worse and be prolonged, causing unprecedented illness and fatalities.\"[44] He told the subcommittee that \"Lives were endangered, and I believe lives were lost\" as a result of the administration's failure to heed his earlier warnings.[2] He testified that 12\u201318 months for vaccine development was only possible if everything went perfectly, and he thought it would take longer.[45] He was represented by attorney Debra Katz in connection with his whistleblower complaint.[2][20][32] Trump dismissed Bright as a \"disgruntled employee\" in Twitter posts.[2]/nOn October 6, 2020, Bright submitted what he called his \"involuntary resignation\" from his final government post, because, as he explained, his superiors had made his work life intolerable. In an addendum to his whistleblower complaint, he stated that, following his demotion, he had been given \"no meaningful work\" since September 4; that NIH officials had rejected his proposals for a national COVID-19 testing strategy \"because of political considerations\"; and that officials had ignored his request that he join the $10 billion Operation Warp Speed initiative to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.[2]", "18027935": "Marian Elliott \"Bunny\" Koshland (October 25, 1921\u00a0\u2013 October 28, 1997) was an American immunologist who discovered that the differences in amino acid composition of antibodies explain the efficiency and effectiveness with which they combat a huge range of foreign invaders./nMarian Elliott was born on October 25, 1921, in New Haven, Connecticut, to Margrethe Schmidt Elliott and Walter Elliott.[1] Her mother was a teacher who had immigrated from Denmark and her father was a hardware salesman of Southern Baptist background.[1] When she was four, her younger brother contracted typhoid fever, and she was tutored by two neighbor girls.[1] She was something of a tomboy, befriending three Jewish boys with whom she would attend Works Progress Administration theater productions. She was the only girl in her class who dared to handle a three-foot black constrictor snake, for which she won a can of rattlesnake meat.[2]/nMarian attended Vassar College in New York and graduated in 1942 with a degree in bacteriology. She then attended the University of Chicago, where she received her M.S. in bacteriology in 1943. In Chicago she worked on reducing the spread of respiratory diseases and was a member of a research team that developed a vaccine for cholera.[1][3]/nWhile at Chicago she met Daniel E. Koshland Jr., a biochemist and heir to the Levi Strauss fortune.[4] In 1945, she joined him in Oak Ridge, Tennessee and spent a year working on the Manhattan Project, researching the biological effects of radiation.[1] The two married in 1946[4] and returned to Chicago, where Marian received her Ph.D. in immunology from the University of Chicago in 1949. Marian's sister-in-law later recalled that her professor did not want to give her a Ph.D. because Marian was pregnant and he thought she would waste it.[5] In 1949, she moved with Daniel to Boston, where Marian spent two years in a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard Medical School's Department of Bacteriology. They later both worked at the Brookhaven National Laboratory for 13 years.[1]/nIn the early 1950s, Marian Koshland demonstrated the molecular differences between serum-borne and secreted antibodies.[1] By the 1960s, she had turned her attention to the origins of antibody specificity. Jim Allison, a colleague from Berkeley, said \"Bunny analyzed polyclonal antibodies directed against two different haptens, and on the basis of exquisitely careful amino acid composition analyses, convincingly showed that these antibodies had different amino acid compositions and therefore must differ in their amino acid sequence. These data had a profound effect on theories of antibody formation and how antibody specificity was generated. Legend has it that at the annual meeting of the American Association of Immunology where she first presented her data, her talk was received by a standing ovation\u2014quite high praise indeed.\"[6]/nIn 1965, Koshland became a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, joining its faculty in 1970. She studied molecular biology with David Baltimore in his M.I.T. lab in the late 1970s.[6] From 1982 to 1989 she was chair of Berkeley's Department of Microbiology and Immunology. Later she led that department's Graduate Affairs Division. She also served on the board of the National Science Foundation and was a president of the Council of American Association of Immunologists in 1982 and in 1983.

He stimulated physical scientists' interest into biology, especially as to basic research to physically explain genes, mysterious at the time.  Formed in 1945 and led by Delbr\u00fcck along with Salvador Luria and Alfred Hershey, the Phage Group made substantial headway unraveling important aspects of genetics. The three shared the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for their discoveries concerning the replication mechanism and the genetic structure of viruses\".[5] He was the first physicist to predict what is now called Delbr\u00fcck scattering.[6][7][8]/nDelbr\u00fcck was born in Berlin, German Empire. His mother was granddaughter of Justus von Liebig, an eminent chemist, while his father Hans Delbr\u00fcck was a history professor at the University of Berlin. In 1937, Delbr\u00fcck left Nazi Germany for America\u2014first California, then Tennessee\u2014becoming a US citizen in 1945.[3] In 1941, he married Mary Bruce. They had four children./nDelbr\u00fcck's brother Justus, a lawyer, as well as his sister Emmi Bonhoeffer were active along with his brothers-in-law Klaus Bonhoeffer and Dietrich Bonhoeffer in resistance to Nazism. Found guilty by the People's Court for roles in the July 20, 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler, Dietrich and Klaus were executed in 1945 by the RSHA. Justus died in Soviet custody that same year. His son, Tobias Delbruck is a professor at the Institute of Neuroinformatics at the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich.[9] Professor Tobias Delbruck is also one of the pioneers in the domain of event cameras,[10] now increasingly being deployed in dynamic vision systems./nDelbr\u00fcck studied astrophysics, shifting towards theoretical physics, at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. After completing his Ph.D. there in 1930,[11] he traveled through England, Denmark, and Switzerland. He met Wolfgang Pauli and Niels Bohr, who interested him in biology./nDelbr\u00fcck returned to Berlin in 1932 as an assistant to Lise Meitner, who was collaborating with Otto Hahn on irradiation of uranium with neutrons.  Delbr\u00fcck wrote a few papers, including one in 1933 on gamma rays' scattering by a Coulomb field's polarization of a vacuum.  Though theoretically tenable, his conclusion was misplaced, whereas Hans Bethe some 20 years later confirmed the phenomenon and named it \"Delbr\u00fcck scattering\".[12]/nIn 1935, Delbr\u00fcck published a collaboration with Nikolay Timofeev-Ressovsky and Karl Zimmer the major work, \u00dcber die Natur der Genmutation und der Genstruktur. It was considered to be a major advance in understanding the nature of gene mutation and gene structure.[13] The work was a keystone in the formation of molecular genetics.[14] It was also an inspirational starting point for  Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger's thinking, a course of lectures in 1943,  and the eventual writing of the book What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell.[15]/nIn 1937, he attained a fellowship from Rockefeller Foundation\u2014which was launching the molecular biology research program\u2014to research genetics of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, in California Institute of Technology's biology department,[16] where Delbr\u00fcck could blend interests in biochemistry and genetics.[17]  While at Caltech, Delbr\u00fcck researched bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophages or phages). In 1939, with Emory L. Ellis,[18][19] he coauthored \"The growth of bacteriophage\",  a paper reporting that the viruses reproduce in one step, not exponentially as do cellular organisms./nAlthough Delbr\u00fcck's Rockefeller Foundation fellowship expired in 1939, the Foundation matched him up with Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, where from 1940 to 1947 he taught physics, yet had his laboratory in the biology department.[21]  In 1941, Delbr\u00fcck met Salvador Luria of Indiana University who began visiting Vanderbilt.[21]  In 1942, Delbr\u00fcck and Luria published on bacterial resistance to virus infection mediated by random mutation.[21] Alfred Hershey of Washington University in St. Louis began visiting in 1943.[21] The Luria\u2013Delbr\u00fcck experiment, also called the Fluctuation Test, demonstrated that Darwin's theory of natural selection acting on random mutations applies to bacteria as well as to more complex organisms. The 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to both scientists in part for this work. To put this work in its historical perspective, Lamarck in 1801 first presented his theory of Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics, which stated that if an organism changes during life in order to adapt to its environment (for example stretches its neck to reach for tall trees), those changes are passed on to its offspring. He also said that evolution happens according to a predetermined plan. Darwin published his theory of evolution in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species with compelling evidence contradicting Lamarck. Darwin said that evolution is not predetermined but that there are inherent variations in all organisms, and that those variations that confer increased fitness are selected by the environment and passed on to the offspring. In the feud between Lamarck and Darwin, Darwin talked of pre-existing changes, but the nature of these changes was not known and had to await the science of genetics by Gregor Mendel's experiments on pea plants published in 1866. Support for Darwin's theory was provided when Thomas Hunt Morgan discovered that a mutated white-eyed fruit fly among red-eyed flies was able to reproduce true white-eyed offspring. The most elegant and convincing support for Darwin's ideas, however, was provided by the Luria-Delbruck experiment,[22][23][24] which showed that mutations conferring resistance of the bacterium E. coli to T1 bacteriophage (virus) existed in the population prior to exposure to T1 and were not induced by adding T1. In other words, mutations are random events that occur whether or not they prove to be useful, while selection (for T1 resistance upon challenge with T1 in this case) provides the direction in evolution by retaining those mutations that are advantageous, discarding those that are harmful (T1 sensitivity in this case). This experiment dealt a blow to Lamarckian inheritance and set the stage for tremendous advances in genetics and molecular biology, launching a tsunami of research that eventually led to the discovery of DNA as the hereditary material and to cracking the genetic code.  Of course, by then Avery, along with McCloud (and earlier, McCarty) was well on the way to showing the genetic capability of DNA./nIn 1945, Delbr\u00fcck, Luria, and Hershey set up a course in bacteriophage genetics at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island, New York.[21]  This Phage Group spurred molecular biology's early development.[25]  Delbr\u00fcck received the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, shared with Luria and Hershey \"for their discoveries concerning the replication mechanism and the genetic structure of viruses\".[5][21][26] The committee also noted that \"The honour in the first place goes to Delbr\u00fcck who transformed bacteriophage research from vague empiricism to an exact science. He analyzed and defined the conditions for precise measurement of the biological effects. Together with Luria he elaborated the quantitative methods and established the statistical criteria for evaluation which made the subsequent penetrating studies possible. Delbr\u00fcck's and Luria's forte is perhaps mainly theoretical analysis, whereas Hershey above all is an eminently skillful experimenter. The three of them supplement each other well also in these respects.\" That year, Delbr\u00fcck and Luria were also awarded by Columbia University the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize.  In late 1947, as Vanderbilt lacked the resources to keep him, Delbr\u00fcck had returned to Caltech as a professor of biology, and remained there for the rest of his career.[21]  Meanwhile, he set up University of Cologne's institute for molecular genetics./nIn addition to the Nobel Prize, Delbr\u00fcck was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1967.[1] He was elected an EMBO Member in 1970.[2] The Max Delbruck Prize, formerly known as the biological physics prize, is awarded by the American Physical Society and named in his honour. The Max Delbr\u00fcck Center, in Berlin, Germany, national research center for molecular medicine of the Helmholtz Association also bears his name./nDelbr\u00fcck helped spur physical scientists' interest in biology.  His inferences on genes' susceptibility to mutation was relied on by physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger in his 1944 book What Is Life?,[27] which conjectured genes were an \"aperiodic crystal\" storing codescript and influenced crystallographer Rosalind Franklin and biologists Francis Crick and James D. Watson in their 1953 identification of cellular DNA's molecular structure as a double helix.[28][29] In 1977, he retired from Caltech, remaining a Professor of Biology emeritus. He became interested in the behavioral sciences and spent some unfruitful effort on mold behavior in the 1960s./nMax Delbr\u00fcck died, at age 74, on the evening of Monday, March 9, 1981, at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, California.  On August 26 to 27, 2006\u2014the year Delbr\u00fcck would have turned 100\u2014family and friends gathered at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory to reminisce on his life and work.[30]  Although Delbr\u00fcck held some anti-reductionist views; he conjectured that ultimately a paradox\u2014akin perhaps to the waveparticle duality of physics\u2014would be revealed about life. His view however, was later refuted upon the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA.[31]", "34543015": "Oleg Petrovich Orlov (Russian: \u041e\u043b\u0435\u0433 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041e\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0432) (born April 4, 1953, in Moscow) is a participator in post-Soviet human rights movements in Russia, chairman of the Board of Human Rights Center \u201cMemorial,\u201d executive board member of the Center's International, Historic-Educational Society.

While occupying this position, Orlov simultaneously became chairman of the Board for the Human Rights Center \u201cMemorial.\u201d[7]/nDuring the coup in Moscow in 1991 Orlov was a defender of \u201cthe Russian White House.\u201d/nFrom 1991 to 1994 he was an observer of conflict zones in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Moldova, and the Ingushetia-Ossetia conflict in the Northern Caucasus. He also co-authored many reports for \u201cMemorial.\u201d[2]/nBeginning in 1994 Orlov, together with Kovalev, who held the post of chairman of the Committee of Human Rights under the President of Russia, worked in the military conflict zone of the Chechen Republic. He personally met Chechen leaders Dzhokhar Dudaev and Aslan Maskhadov, participated in negotiations to exchange prisoners, and inspected hospitals and camps for prisoners of war.[2]/nIn June 1995 Oleg Orlov, as part of a group headed by S.A. Kovalev, participated in negotiations with terrorists, who under the direction of Shamil Basaev captured hostages in the city of Budyonovsk. After successful negotiations, members of S.A. Kovalev's group (including Orlov) became voluntary hostages in order to guarantee the agreed-upon exchange of the majority of hostages.[8][9]/nSubsequently, Orlov and Human Rights Center \u201cMemorial\u201d gave much attention to the problem of kidnapping in the Caucasus and victims living among the peaceful populations of the Chechen Republic, Ingushetia and Dagestan.[10] Orlov also refused an offer from Kovalev to work in the presidential human rights structure./nIn 2004 Orlov became a member of the President of the Russian Federation's council for the development of civil society and human rights institutions under the leadership of Ella Pamifilova. In 2006 he left the council as a sign of protest against a comment made by Russian president Vladimir Putin concerning the murder of journalist Anna Politkovska, in which he announced that the murder brought Russia a bigger loss than her publications.[11][12]/nSince the beginning of the second Chechen war in October 1999 Orlov has headed the work of \u201cMemorial\u201d in the Northern Caucasus, where representatives of \u201cMemorial\u201d work in Chechnya, Ingushetia, Dagestan, Northern Ossetia, Kabardino-Balkariya, and Stavropolsky territory./nSince April 2004 Orlov has also been a member of the Advisory Council under the Human Rights Commissioner in the Russian Federation./nOn the night of November 24, 2007, the day before a protest in Nazran, Oleg Orlov and a group of TV reporters from REN TV were taken hostages in a Nazran hotel by an armed group of people in masks. While threatening the hostages with their weapons, the kidnappers forced them to wear black bags and drove the hostages outside the city to a field, where they dragged them from the car and began beating them. One of the journalists who suffered through the ordeal later told:/n\u201cThey beat us silently. After that, one of them said they were going to shoot us now. But then with a snicker he added, \u2018It\u2019s a pity we didn\u2019t bring silencers\u2019 and then they left.\u201d/nThe attackers stole video equipment, documents, cell phones, and personal items from Orlov and the journalists. An hour before the attack the patrol squad that was keeping watch in the Assa Hotel left their post under orders from their superiors. The car with the hostages was not stopped once along the way. Oleg Orlov and the other victims are convinced they were attacked by officers of special services and that the attack itself was \u201can act of intimidation.\u201d[13][14]/nAccording to the facts of the attack a court case was drawn up under three articles of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (UKRF):[15] \u201chindrance of lawful professional work of journalists\u201d (item 144, part 1 UKRF), \u201cillegal penetration into a dwelling with application of violence\u201d (item 139, part 2 UKRF), and \u201ctheft \u2013 open plunder of another\u2019s property\u201d (item 161, part 1 UKRF). A group of well-known Russian human rights activists appealed to the Human Rights Commissioner in Russia, Vladimir Lukin, and to Ella Pamfilova, the Chairman of the President of the Russian Federation's council for the development of civil society and human rights institutions. In their appeal they pointed out the inaccuracy in the particulars of the court case:/n\u201cThe investigators \u2018did not make note\u2019 that \u2018kidnapping\u2019 (item 126), \u2018threat by murder\u2019 (item 119), \u2018assault\u2019 (item 116), and \u2018deliberate harm to health\u2019 (item 112) took place. A one-and-a-half hour run wearing only socks in freezing cold weather is already a sufficient basis to begin speaking of inhuman treatment to victims. Finally, \u2018plunder of property with application of violence\u2019 is not qualified as \u2018theft\u2019, but as \u2018robbery\u2019 (item 162 UKRF).\u201d[16]/nIn 2009 Orlov placed blame for the murder of \u201cMemorial\u201d employee Natalya Estemirova, which took place in July 2009, on the head of the President of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov. In response to this, Kadyrov filed suit against Orlov and HRC \u201cMemorial\u201d in order to protect his honor, dignity, business reputation, and to receive compensation for moral injury. On October 6, 2009, the judge partly satisfied Kadyrov's claim, collecting 20 thousand Rubles from Orlov and 50 thousand Rubles from \u201cMemorial.\u201d[17][18] The judge viewed the statements from Orlov about the personal or indirect fault of Kadyrov in the death of Estemirova as discrediting the honor and dignity of the President.[19] Orlov specified that he did not mean that Kadyrov himself had directly participated in the crime, but that he was responsible for what was happening in the republic.[19] Orlov pointed out that the head of the Chechen Republic had created such conditions as to make it impossible for human rights activists to work in the republic; and what's more\u2014they (human rights activists) are declared as \u201cpermitted targets.\u201d[20][21] The Commissioner of Human Rights in the Chechen Republic\u2014Nurdi Nukhazhiev\u2014announced that Orlov \u201cgot off easy.\u201d According to Nukhazhiev, \u201cHe (Orlov), in his biased statements, has publicly disgraced the honor, dignity, and business reputation \u2026 of Kadyrov. And in such situations the judge should be more severe.\u201d[19] \nOn June 6, 2010, for that same public statement, Orlov was accused of a criminal offense for \u201cslander\u201d (item 129, part 3 UKRF).[22] \nOrlov's court process began on September 13, 2010. Genry Markovich Reznik became his lawyer. The state accuser asked that Orlov be found guilty and fined 150 thousand rubles. The representative of Kadyrov demanded a punishment of 3 years imprisonment.[23][24] On June 14, 2011, magistrate of the court district No.363 of the Khamoviki region of Moscow declared Orlov \u201cnot guilty.\u201d[25] Kadyrov's representative, as well as the state prosecutor, has appealed against this verdict. The consideration of appeals still continues today.[26]/nFollowing the large-scale searches of \"Memorial\" employees related to the case of \"rehabilitation of Nazi ideology,\" it has been revealed that co-chairman of the \"Memorial\" Center, Oleg Orlov, is under investigation for \"repeatedly discrediting the Russian army.\" Orlov has been charged and is now under recognisance not to leave.[27]/nOn March 21, 2023, at approximately 7:02\u00a0a.m., employees of the Investigative Committee of Russia and Centre E (a nickname for Centre for combating extremism in Russia) arrived at Oleg Orlov's residence with a search warrant. Searches related to the rehabilitation of Nazi ideology case (section \"c,\" article 354.1 of the Russian Criminal Code) were conducted at several addresses of Memorial's employees and their relatives, as well as in buildings on Karetny Ryad and Maliy Karetny Lane.

The standard author abbreviation Bory is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name.[3]/nJean-Baptiste Bory de Saint Vincent was born at Agen on 6 July 1778. His parents were G\u00e9raud Bory de Saint-Vincent and Madeleine de Journu; his father's family were petty nobility who played important roles at the bar and in the judiciary, during and after the French Revolution.[4] Instilled with sentiments hostile to the revolution from childhood,[5] he studied first at the college of Agen, then with his uncle Journu-Auber in Bordeaux in 1787. He may have attended courses in medicine and surgery from 1791 to 1793. During the Reign of Terror in 1793, his family was persecuted and took refuge in the Landes./nIn 1794, as a precocious naturalist, aged 15, Bory was instrumental in freeing from prison[6] the entomologist Pierre Andr\u00e9 Latreille, whose early work he had read, and in saving Latreille from deportation to the penal colony of Cayenne.[N 1] Latreille later became one of the leading entomologists of his time; he and Bory remained lifelong friends.

Thanks to the recommendation of Jean-G\u00e9rard Lacu\u00e9e, also from Agen, he was soon appointed second lieutenant.[8] He served first in the Army of the West, then in the  Army of the Rhine under the orders of General Jean Victor Marie Moreau.[5][9] He was then assigned to Brittany and moved to Rennes; it was at this time that he acquired his Bonapartist sentiments./nIn 1799, Bory learned about the upcoming departure of a scientific expedition to Australia organized by the government and obtained, thanks to his uncle and to the famous naturalist Bernard-Germain de Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de,[9] the position of chief botanist aboard one of the three participating corvettes. Thus, after having left the Army of the West at the end of August and receiving from the Ministry of War an indefinite leave, Bory left Paris on 30 September and embarked in Le Havre on 19 October 1799 aboard the corvette commanded by Captain Nicolas Baudin, Le Naturaliste.[8][5][9][10]/nAfter several stops in Madeira, the Canary islands, and Cape Verde and then rounding the Cape of Good Hope, towards the middle of the trip Bory suddenly left the ship of Captain Baudin with whom he was in conflict[8] and explored alone (and with limited resources) several islands of the African seas.[5][9] He visited  Mauritius in March 1800 during a stopover. From there, he sailed to the neighboring island of R\u00e9union,[5] where in October 1801 he ascended the Piton de la Fournaise, the active volcano of the island, and wrote the first general scientific description of it. He gave the name of his former professor Dolomieu, of whose death he had just learned, to one of the craters he described as a mamelon.

Bory worked on scientific and literary works as well, and took part in the writing of the satirical liberal, anti-monarchist and pro-Bonapartist newspaper, the Nain Jaune.[8][5][9]/nOn the return of Napoleon from exile, Bory was elected by the college of the department of Lot-et-Garonne, on 16 May 1815, to the office of representative of Agen at the Chamber of the Hundred Days and sat with the liberals.[N 2] He proclaimed the constitution, gave a resounding speech before the tribune,[8]  and virulently opposed the Minister of Police, Joseph Fouch\u00e9, Duke of Otranto./nAbsent at Waterloo, his mandate as deputy confining him to the legislative body, he saw the abdication of Napoleon I and the return of king Louis XVIII. Placed by Fouch\u00e9 on the lists of proscription by the Ordonnance of 24 July 1815,[9] which condemned 57 persons for having served Napoleon during the Hundred Days after having pledged allegiance to Louis XVIII, Bory first took refuge in the valley of Montmorency, from where, hidden, he published his Justification de la conduite et des opinions de M. Bory de Saint-Vincent.[9] Then, the amnesty law of 12 January 1816 was proclaimed by the King, condemning Bory to exile,[5] and he went to Li\u00e8ge under a false name.[9] First invited by the King of Prussia (thanks to Bory's friendship with the naturalist Alexander von Humboldt) to stay in Berlin, then in Aachen, he was expelled after eighteen months.[9] He refused to submit to the decision which assigned him to K\u00f6nigsberg or Prague for his residence,[9] and when he was offered a commission as General in Bol\u00edvar's new Republic of Colombia by botanist and friend (and vice-president) Francisco Antonio Zea, he declined. He finally managed to reach Holland, disguised as a brandy merchant and with a false passport, then Brussels, where he met Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s and where he lived until 1820.[8][5][9] With Auguste Drapiez and Jean-Baptiste Van Mons, he founded and became one of the scientific directors of the Annales g\u00e9n\u00e9rales des Sciences physiques, edited in Brussels by the printer Weissenbruch from 1819 to 1821.[8] The articles, written by international scientific luminaries, were illustrated with lithographs printed first by Duval de Mercourt and then by Marcellin Jobard./nOn 1 January 1820, Bory was finally allowed to return to France. Dismissed from the army and deprived of pay, he returned to Paris where he lived until 1825.[9] He was obliged to devote himself entirely to editorial work (on his  Annales  of Brussels in particular) and he collaborated with various liberal newspapers,[5] including the Courrier fran\u00e7ais, which reserved for him the drafting of the reports on the sessions of the Chamber of Deputies.[9] He gave up later, when, devoting himself entirely to science, he found in the many books he was selling to booksellers an honorable means of livelihood.[9] However, in 1823, he fought a duel with a pistol and was wounded in the foot, and, in 1825, he was thrown in prison at Sainte-P\u00e9lagie for debts,[8][5] where he remained until 1827.[N 3][N 4]/nIt was during this productive period in 1822, that Bory, along with most of the scientists of his time, including Arago, Brongniart, Drapiez, Geoffroy de Saint-Hilaire, von Humboldt, de Jussieu, de Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de, Latreille, etc., began the writing  of one of his greatest works, the Dictionnaire classique d'histoire naturelle en 17 volumes (1822-1831).[8]/nA war of Independence had been raging in Greece since 1821,[11][12] but the Greek victories were short-lived and the Turkish-Egyptian troops had reconquered the Peloponnese in 1825. King Charles X, supported by a strong current of philhellenism, decided to intervene alongside the Greek insurgents. After the naval Battle of Navarino (20 October 1827), which saw the annihilation of the Turkish-Egyptian fleet by the Allied Franco-Russo-British fleet, a French expeditionary force of 15,000 men landed in the south-west of the Peloponnese in August 1828. The purpose of the Exp\u00e9dition de Mor\u00e9e[13] was to liberate the area from the Turkish-Egyptian occupation forces and return it to the young independent Greek state; this would be accomplished in just one month.[11][12]/nTowards the end of the year 1828, the Viscount of Martignac, Interior minister of King Charles X and the real head of the government at that time (as well as being a childhood friend of Bory in Bordeaux), charged six academicians of the Institute de France (Georges Cuvier, \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, Charles-Beno\u00eet Hase, Desir\u00e9-Raoul Rochette, Jean-Nicolas Hyot and Jean-Antoine Letronne) with appointing the chief-officers and members of each section of a scientific committee to be attached to the Morea expedition, just as had been done previously with the Commission of Sciences and Arts during Napoleon's campaign in Egypt.[8][9][14] Bory was thus appointed director of the commission.[8][5][9] The minister and the academicians also determined the routes and objectives.[14] Bory wrote, \"Messrs. De Martignac and Sim\u00e9on had asked me expressly not to restrict my observations to Flies and Herbs, but to extend them to places and to men later...\" .[14][15]/nBory and his team of 19 scientists (including Edgar Quinet, Abel Blouet and Pierre Peytier) representing various scientific disciplines, such as  natural history and antiquities (archaeology, architecture and sculpture) disembarked from the frigate Cyb\u00e8le at Navarino on 3 March 1829 and there joined General Nicolas Joseph Maison, who was commanding the French expeditionary force. Bory then met General Antoine Simon Durrieu, chief of staff of the expedition, who was also from the Landes region and with whom Bory had been connected for a decade.[8] Bory stayed in Greece for 8 months, until November 1829, and explored the Peloponnese, Attica and the Cyclades[14] The scientific work of the commission was of major importance to the increase knowledge of the country.[16][17][18] The topographic maps they produced, which were widely acknowledged, were of an unprecedented high quality and surveys, drawings, cuts, plans and proposals for the theoretical restoration of the monuments were a new attempt to systematically and exhaustively catalogue the ancient Greek vestiges. The Morea expedition and its scientific publications offered a near complete description of the regions visited and formed a scientific, aesthetic and human inventory that remained for a long time one of the best achieved about Greece.[16][17][18] Bory registered all the results of his research and published them later in his major opus of 1832.[14]/nAfter his return from Greece, Bory pursued his scholarly career; in 1830, he presented his candidacy at the Institute de France for the vacant seat  left by the death of Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck, obtaining the votes of Arago, Cuvier, Fourier and Th\u00e9nard among others. He also participated in the founding of the Entomological Society of France, the oldest entomological society in the world, on 29 February 1832, alongside his old friend Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Latreille.[8]/nIn 1830, while Bory was occupied writing his work on Morea (by ministry order), the July Ordinances promulgated by King Charles X to obtain elections more favorable to the Ultra-royalists, and which suspended freedom of the press, revived his political sentiments.[9] He fought on the barricades of the Faubourg Saint-Germain and was first at the H\u00f4tel de Ville.[5] After these Three Glorious [Days] (the July Revolution) and the new appointment of Marshal Soult to the Ministry of War on 3 November 1830, Bory was finally, after 15 years, reinstated in the army, to his former rank of Colonel with the General Staff and to his post at the war depository, which he had held in 1815.[8][5][9] He remained there throughout the course of the July Monarchy (1830-1848) until 1842, four years before his death. On 1 May 1831, Bory was appointed Officer of the Legion of Honor./nAround the same time, on 5 July 1831, Bory was elected[N 5] deputy of the 3rd college of Lot-et-Garonne (Marmande) to replace his friend the Viscount of Martignac.[N 6] In his profession of faith, he denounced the hereditary titles of the peerage, which he declared to be contradictory to the principle of equality before the law, spoke against the incompatibility of the legislature's mandate with a public function, and advocated for the revision of the municipal, electoral and national guard laws.[9] The conservative tendencies of the majority forced him, after only two months in that position, to resign as deputy[8][5][9] on 19 August 1831. He was replaced in October by Monsieur de Martignac./nIn 1832, Bory published the report of his exploration in Greece in  his work, the Relation du voyage de la commission scientifique de Mor\u00e9e dans le P\u00e9loponn\u00e8se, les Cyclades et l'Attique, for which he received many accolades,[9] and which allowed him to be finally elected a  member of the French Academy of Sciences on 17 November 1834./nBetween 1835 and 1838, Bory sat on the General Staff commission and republished his Justifications of 1815 under the title of M\u00e9moires in 1838. On 24 August 1839, a commission of scientific exploration of Algeria (Commission d'exploration scientifique d'Alg\u00e9rie) on the model of those which were put in place in Egypt (1798) and in Morea (1829), was designed for the newly conquered, but not yet pacified Algeria.[16][19] Bory de Saint-Vincent, who had been one of its promoters, became its president as a staff Colonel and went there, accompanied by his collaborators, to conduct his identifications, researches, samplings and scientific explorations. He arrived in the first days of January 1840 in Algiers and visited other cities of the coast. He left Algeria in the first trimester of 1842.[8][16][20] Bory published numerous books on the country, such as Notice sur la commission exploratrice et scientifique d'Alg\u00e9rie (1838), Sur la flore de l'Alg\u00e9rie (1843), Sur l'anthropologie de l'Afrique fran\u00e7aise (1845) and the Exploration scientifique de l'Alg\u00e9rie pendant les ann\u00e9es 1840, 1841, 1842.

He died, however, on 22 December 1846, at the age of sixty-eight, of a heart attack, in his apartment on the 5th floor, 6 rue de Bussy in Paris.[8] He left behind him only debts and his herbarium, which was sold the following year.[21] He was buried in the P\u00e8re-Lachaise Cemetery (49th Division).[22]/nAn indefatigable worker, Bory wrote on several branches of natural history, including the study of reptiles, fish, microscopic animals, plants, cryptogams, etc. He was the main editor of the Biblioth\u00e8que physico-\u00e9conomique, of the Dictionnaire classique d'histoire naturelle en 7 volumes and of the scientific part of the Exp\u00e9dition de Mor\u00e9e. He participated in composing for the Encyclop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique the sections concerning the zoophytes and the worms, as well as for the volumes of the physical geography and atlas that accompanied them. He also wrote well-composed geographical summaries, especially the one concerning Spain, and contributed many articles notable for the originality of their ideas to the Encyclop\u00e9die moderne./nBory was a proponent of the theory of the transmutation of species alongside, among others, Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck.[23][24][25] According to historian Adrian Desmond Bory was a leading anti-Cuvierian materialist who blended the best of Lamarck's philosophy with Geoffroy's higher anatomy.[26] His Dictionnaire classique d'histoire naturelle already contained information about Lamarck and the species debate, and is notable for a copy of it having been carried by Charles Darwin on the Beagle.[23][24][27]/nBory was also a fervent defender of spontaneous generation (theme of the famous controversy between Louis Pasteur and F\u00e9lix Archim\u00e8de Pouchet) and an ardent polygenist. He thought  that the different human \"races\", according to the sense of the time, were true species, each having its own origin and history.[28] He was finally a notorious opponent of slavery; Victor Sch\u0153lcher quotes him among his scientific allies in favor of abolition./nIn September 1802, at Rennes where he was garrisoned, Bory married Anne-Charlotte Delacroix of la Th\u00e9baudais, with whom he had two daughters: Clotilde, born on 7 February 1801, and Augustine, born on 25 May 1803, whom he called  \"his little Antigone\" and with whom he remained very close all his life. His marriage, \"contracted too young to be a happy one\"[8] did not last. His wife died in 1823, after their separation./nWhen he was proscribed by the Ordonnance of 24 July 1815 and was fleeing to Rouen, he met the actress Maria Gros. She followed him throughout his exile between 1815 and 1820; they began to cohabitate in 1817.[8] On 17 May 1818, their first daughter, Cassilda, was born.

His post-secondary plans were to study physics. When he was drafted by the United States Army in 1943, he was given the choice of attending medical school with his course of study paid for by the military or going to the front lines. Chanock passed the entrance examination and graduated from the University of Chicago in 1945 and the University of Chicago School of Medicine in 1947.[1][2][3] He did his internship at Highland Hospital in Oakland and trained in pediatrics at the University of Chicago.[1]/nAfter completing his medical training, he did a fellowship at Cincinnati's Children's Hospital, where he worked under Albert Sabin, who called Chanock his \"star scientific son.\"[3] He was drafted by the Army in 1952 and was sent to Korea to help deal with an outbreak of Japanese encephalitis, but a ruptured appendix forced him to Tokyo, where he did research on infectious disease. He returned to Children's Hospital after being released from Army duty, and later did research at the University of Cincinnati and Johns Hopkins University.[1]/nHe joined the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, where he discovered the human respiratory syncytial virus, which is the cause of respiratory tract infections in children each winter, and is one of the most common causes of illness.[1] Asked the best means to prevent the disease, Chanock quipped \"one thing you can tell them is to have their babies in the spring\".[3]/nIn 1962 Robert Chanock visited Dr. Leonard Hayflick at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to obtain a culture of his normal human fetal cell strain, WI-38, because of Hayflick's report that it replicated all of the then known human viruses. Chanock described his work with the \u201cEaton Agent\u201d to Hayflick where it was  assumed it to be the viral cause of Primary Atypical Pneumonia (PAP) or \u201cwalking pneumonia\u201d in humans. This cause was never proven./nHayflick suggested to Chanock that the cause might be a mycoplasma (then called a PPLO). Hayflick wrote his thesis on mycoplasma causes of respiratory diseases in animals and suggested to Chanock that PAP might be caused by a mycoplasma. Chanock replied that he never heard of PPLO's. At Hayflick's request egg yolk in which the Eaton Agent was grown was sent to him by Chanock. Hayflick grew a mycoplasma, the smallest free-living microorganism, on a unique agar growth medium that he developed. Together they proved that it was the etiological agent of PAP.[4] Hayflick named the organism Mycoplasma pneumoniae./nChanock was named head of the NIAID's Laboratory of Infectious Diseases in 1968. The WI-38 normal human cell strain gifted to Chanock resulted in the development of an adenovirus vaccine in 1964. This vaccine has been used in the world's military where the virus produces a disease similar to the flu and forces recruits to enter clinics for many days./nResearchers working with Chanock developed another vaccine using WI-38 to prevent Hepatitis A. They also produced a rotavirus vaccine, addressing the most common cause of severe diarrhoea in infants and young children, as well as an influenza virus vaccine in the form of a nasal spray. Efforts were undertaken to create a vaccine to deal with dengue fever, though efforts to create immunizations for para-influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus were unsuccessful.[4]/nChanock was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1973.[1] He was also honored with the Robert Koch Prize, the Albert B.

Midway through, Horwich was not sure about an entirely clinical future. After completing his residency, he joined the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California for a postdoctoral position in molecular biology and virology.[10] At Salk, he worked in Walter Eckhart's laboratory alongside Tony Hunter and witnessed Hunter's discovery of tyrosine phosphorylation.[10] He credits this time with sharpening his skills as a scientist. He said, \"Tony taught me the nuts and bolts of thinking about a problem.\"[10]/nIn 1981, Horwich moved back to New Haven, Connecticut for a postdoctoral fellowship at Yale University School of Medicine. He worked in the laboratory of Leon Rosenberg.[11]/nIn 1984, he moved across the hall from Rosenberg's lab to start his own laboratory as an assistant professor in the department of genetics. He still collaborated with members of the Rosenberg laboratory, including Wayne Fenton. As an independent researcher, Horwich asked whether the pathway that imports an enzyme called ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) into the mitochondria of mammalian cells also could work in yeast. In 1987, during a genetic screen in yeast, Horwich and his colleagues stumbled across a protein folding function inside mitochondria. In the mutant strain, proteins entered mitochondria from the cytosol normally but then misfolded and aggregated. They named the protein encoded by the affected gene HSP60, Heat shock protein 60, because it has a mass of 60 kDa and is produced in larger quantity in response to heat. Hsp60 is found in an 850 kDa double ring assembly, each ring containing 7 copies of Hsp60. Such assemblies, known as chaperonins, also exist in other cellular compartments and are essential components, mediating protein folding under both heat shock and normal conditions.[12]/nSince 1987, Horwich and his colleagues have been studying these molecules both in vivo and in vitro, with particular emphasis on the Hsp60 homologue in E. coli known as GroEL. They and others found early on that a chaperonin-mediated folding reaction can be reconstituted in a test tube, and that has enabled structural and functional studies that have begun to explain how chaperonins work./nHe has also received two Protein Society awards \u2013 the Hans Neurath Award in 2001 and the Stein and Moore Award in 2006.[21]", "8066531": "Jozef Stefaan \"Jeff\", Baron Schell (20 July 1935 \u2013 17 April 2003) was a Belgian molecular biologist.[1][2]/nSchell studied zoology and microbiology at the University of Ghent, Belgium.

Mangelsdorf Professor of Natural Sciences and Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology at Harvard University.[3][4][5] He published over 400 papers and co-edited three books.[5]/nHastings research on bioluminescence principally focused on bacterial luminescence (over 150 papers) and dinoflagellates (over 80 papers).[5] In addition to bacteria and dinoflagellates, he, with his students and colleagues, also published papers on the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of light production in fungi, cnidarians, ctenophores, polychaetes, insects (fireflies and dipterans), ostracod crustaceans, millipedes, tunicates, and fishes with bacterial light organs. His laboratory produced the first evidence for quorum sensing in bacteria,[6] early evidence of the molecular mechanisms of circadian clock regulation in organisms (first using dinoflagellate luminescence and then expanded to other cellular proteins),[2][7][8] and some of the initial studies of energy transfer in green fluorescent proteins (GFP) in cnidarian luminescence.[9][10]/nHastings lived in Seaford, Delaware, during his early childhood; in 1937, he joined the choir at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine and attended the choir's in-house boarding school, visiting his family during vacations. Hastings moved to Lenox School in Lenox, Massachusetts, in 1941 to complete his secondary education and was interested in literature, physics, mathematics, ice hockey and basketball.[11]/nThroughout his career Hastings received numerous awards and honors:/nHastings began his graduate studies at Princeton University in 1948 in the laboratory of E. Newton Harvey, the world leader of luminescence studies at the time, and focused on the role of oxygen in the luminescence of bacteria, fireflies, ostracod crustaceans and fungi. He received his PhD in 1951.[12] He then joined the lab of William D. McElroy, another student of Harvey\u2019s, at Johns Hopkins University where he discovered both the stimulatory effects of coenzyme A and gating control by oxygen of firefly luminescence, and that flavin is a substrate in bacterial luminescence./nIn 1953 he joined the faculty in the Department of Biological Sciences at Northwestern University. In 1954 he began a long collaboration with Beatrice M. Sweeney, who was then at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, in elucidating the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of luminescence in the unicellular dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedrum (formerly known as Gonyaulax polyedra). A byproduct of this initial research was their discovery of circadian control of the luminescence./nIn 1957, Hastings next took a faculty position in the Biochemistry Division of the Chemistry Department at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign where he continued his focus on dinoflagellate and bacterial luminescence and dinoflagellate circadian rhythms. Hastings joined the faculty of Harvard University as Professor of Biology in 1966. During this period he continued and expanded his studies of circadian rhythms in dinoflagellates and luminescence in bacteria, dinoflagellates and other organisms.

In quorum sensing (initially termed autoinduction), the bacteria release a substance into the medium, the autoinducer. Once the concentration of this substance reaches a critical level (a measure of the number of bacteria in a limited area), transcription of specific other genes that had been repressed are turned on. Once the sequenced autoinducer gene was found to occur widely in gram-negative bacteria quorum sensing became accepted in the early 1990s. It is now known that in many pathogenic bacteria, there is delayed production of toxins, which serve to greatly augment their pathogenicity, this is similar to what happens for luciferase proteins. By curtailing their toxin output until the bacterial populations are substantial, these bacteria can generate massive quantities of toxin quickly and thereby swamp the defences of the host./nLuminescent Dinoflagellates: In early 1954 at Northwestern University, Hastings, his students and colleagues studied cellular and molecular aspects of bioluminescence in dinoflagellates [especially Lingulodinium polyedrum (formerly Gonyaulax polyedra)]. They elucidated the structures of the luciferins and luciferases,[17] the organization and regulation of their associated genes, temporal control mechanisms,[18] and the actual sub-cellular identity and location of the light emitting elements, which they termed scintillons.[19] They demonstrated that the reaction is controlled by a drop in pH when an action potential leads to the entry of protons via voltage-activated membrane channels in the scintillons.[20] Through immunolocalization studies the Hastings lab showed that scintillons are small peripheral vesicles (0.4 \u03bcm) that contain both the luciferase and the luciferin-binding protein.[21] More recently, the lab found that the luciferase gene in Lingulodinium polyedrum and other closely related species contains three homologous and contiguous repeated sequences in a kind of \"three-ring circus with the same act in all three.\"[22] However, another luminescent, but heterotrophic, dinoflagellate, Noctiluca scintillans, has but a single protein, which appears to possess both catalytic and substrate binding properties in a single, rather than separate proteins./nDinoflagellate Circadian Rhythms: Using Lingulodinium polyedrum as a model, Hastings spearheaded our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in control of circadian rhythms,[23] which in humans are involved in sleep, jet-lag and other daily activities. His lab has shown that the rhythm of bioluminescence involves a daily synthesis and destruction of proteins.[24] Because the mRNAs that code for these proteins remain unchanged from day to night, the synthesis of these proteins is controlled at the translational level.[25] This work has now been expanded to other proteins in the cell. On the other hand, short pulses of inhibitors of synthesis of these proteins results in phase shifts of the circadian rhythm, either delays or advances, depending when the pulse is administered.[26] At still another level, protein phosphorylation inhibitors also influence the period of the rhythm.[27]/nOther luminescent systems: Early in his career Hastings developed techniques to quantify the level of oxygen required in a luminescent reaction for several different species including bacteria, fungi, fireflies and ostracod crustaceans.[28] This work showed that oxygen gating is the mechanism for firefly flashing.[29] In other work when he was in the McElroy lab he examined the basic biochemical mechanism of firefly luciferase and demonstrated that coenzyme A stimulates light emission.[30] His lab first demonstrated that the green in vivo coelenterate bioluminescence occurs because of energy transfer from the luminescent molecule (aequorin), which alone emits blue light, to a secondary green emitter which they termed green fluorescent protein (GFP).[9] Once characterized and cloned, GFP has become a crucial molecule used as a reporter and tagging tool for studying gene activation and developmental patterns.[10] Osamu Shimomura, Martin Chalfie and Roger Tsien received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2008 for their work on this remarkable molecule./nHastings died of pulmonary fibrosis on August 6, 2014, at Lexington, Massachusetts.[1]/nSelected publications:", "52073972": "Vinod Bhakuni (1962\u20132011) was an Indian molecular biophysicist and the head of the Molecular and Structural Biology Division of the Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI).[1] He was the founder of the Protein Chemistry laboratory of CDRI and was known for his contributions to the study of protein folding.[2] A recipient of the National Bioscience Award for Career Development,[3] he was an elected fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences,[4] Indian National Science Academy[5] and the National Academy of Sciences, India.[6] The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 2006, for his contributions to biological sciences.[7]/nVinod Bhakuni was born on 24 May 1962 in the Indian state of Uttarakhand, did his graduate and master's studies at the University of Lucknow and joined Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI) for his doctoral studies under the guidance of C.

He is also a researcher in systems biology, having made discoveries regarding the actions of antibiotics and the emergence of antibiotic resistance.[2]/nCollins is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, the National Academy of Medicine, and the National Academy of Sciences for his contributions to synthetic biology and engineered gene networks./nCollins was born on June 26, 1965, in The Bronx, then moved to Bellerose, New York.[3] His father was an aviation engineer who worked on projects for NASA and the military. At age 10, Collins moved to New Hampshire with his family after finishing elementary school,[4] growing up in Nashua.[5] He first developed an interest in medical engineering when one of his grandfathers became blind and the other suffered multiple strokes.[6]/nCollins originally intended to study electrical engineering as an undergraduate and was accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). He decided instead to attend the College of the Holy Cross, finding the atmosphere at the college more friendly. Collins later recalled, \"I fell in love with the place. I wanted to work hard and get a strong education, but I also wanted to enjoy myself. I wanted to get a broad experience, and I felt I could get that at Holy Cross\".[2]/nAt Holy Cross, Collins was a class officer and a member of the track and cross country teams. He also wrote for the school newspaper and taught as part of the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine (CCD). As an undergraduate, he had been awarded a President's Volunteer Service Award and was designated as a Fenwick Scholar in 1986, one of the college's highest honors.[7] Collins graduated from Holy Cross in 1987 as class valedictorian, receiving a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in physics, summa cum laude.[2] His undergraduate thesis was titled \"Functional Neuromuscular Stimulation: An Analysis of the Biomechanical and Neuromuscular Foundations of Walking\".[8]/nAfter graduating, Collins was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study medical engineering at Balliol College, Oxford, where he earned a Doctor of Philosophy (D.Phil.) in 1990.[9] His dissertation was titled \"Joint Mechanics: Modelling of the Lower Limb\" and was supervised by John J. O'Connor.[10]/nCollins returned to the United States to join the faculty of Boston University. There, he established a laboratory and became the university's William F. Warren Distinguished Professor, a University Professor, a professor of biomedical engineering, a professor of medicine, and co-director of the Center for BioDynamics and Director of the Center of Synthetic Biology. In 2008, Collins was named as a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, becoming the first investigator from Boston University.[5]/nIn 2014, Collins moved to become a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[11] Currently, Collins is the Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering & Science and Professor of Biological Engineering at MIT. Collins is also a core founding faculty member of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University and a member of the Broad Institute. Collins is also faculty lead for life sciences at the MIT Jameel Clinic since 2018.[12][13]/nCollins has been involved with a number of start-up companies, and his inventions and technologies have been licensed by over 25 biotech and medical device companies.  Collins is the scientific co-founder of several biotech companies and non-profit organizations./nIn 2010, Collins was appointed by President Barack Obama to be a member of the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues.[14]/nCollins' work on synthetic gene circuits launched the field of synthetic biology.[15]  He was the first (along with Michael Elowitz and Stanislas Leibler) to show that one can harness the biophysical properties of nucleic acids and proteins to create biological circuits, which can be used to rewire and reprogram living cells./nIn a paper published in Nature,[16] Collins designed and constructed a genetic toggle switch \u2013 a synthetic, bistable gene regulatory network \u2013 in E. coli.  The toggle switch forms a synthetic, addressable cellular memory unit with broad implications for biophysics, biomedicine and biotechnology. In the same issue of Nature, Elowitz and Leibler showed that one can build a synthetic genetic oscillator (called the repressilator) in E. coli.[17] Collins\u2019 Nature paper on the genetic toggle switch[16] and Elowitz's and Leibler's Nature paper[17] on the repressilator are considered landmark pieces, ones that marks the beginnings of synthetic biology.[15]/nBuilding on this work, Collins showed that synthetic gene networks can be used as regulatory modules and interfaced with a microbe's genetic circuitry to create programmable cells for a variety applications,[18] e.g., synthetic probiotics to serve as living diagnostics and living therapeutics to detect, treat and prevent infections such as cholera and C. difficile.[19][20] He also designed and constructed engineered riboregulators (RNA switches) for sensing and control,[21][22][23][24][25][26] microbial kill switches and genetic counters for biocontainment,[27][28][29] synthetic bacteriophage to combat resistant bacterial infections,[30][31] genetic switchboards for metabolic engineering,[32] and tunable genetic switches for gene and cell therapy.[33][34][35] Recently, Collins developed freeze-dried, cell-free synthetic gene circuits, an innovative platform that forms the basis for inexpensive, paper-based diagnostic tests for emerging pathogens (e.g., Zika, Ebola, SARS-CoV-2, antibiotic-resistant bacteria),[36][37][38][39] wearable biosensors,[40] and portable biomolecular manufacturing (e.g., to produce vaccine antigens) in the developing world.[41]/nIn the context of synthetic biology and regenerative medicine, Collins collaborated with Derrick Rossi and George Q. Daley on a study using synthetic mRNA technology for biomedical applications. The team showed that synthetic mRNA could be used for highly efficient stem cell reprogramming and redifferentiation. This work was published in Cell Stem Cell in 2010,[42] and Rossi used this synthetic biology technology platform to found Moderna.[43]/nCollins has also used synthetic biology approaches (computational and experimental) to identify and address significant biological physics questions regarding the regulation of gene expression and cell dynamics. Collins, for example, has utilized synthetic gene networks to study the effects of positive feedback in genetic modules,[44][45] the role and origin of stochastic fluctuations in eukaryotic gene expression,[46] and the phenotypic consequences of gene expression noise and its effects on cell fate and microbial survival strategies in stressful environments.[47] Importantly, Collins has also demonstrated how synthetic gene circuits can be used to test, validate and improve qualitative and quantitative models of gene regulation,[48] and shown that biophysical theory and experiment can be coupled in bottom-up approaches to gain biological insights into the intricate processes of gene regulation.[49]/nCollins is also one of the leading researchers in systems biology through the use of experimental-computational biophysical techniques to reverse engineer and analyze endogenous gene regulatory networks.[50]  Collins and collaborators showed that reverse-engineered gene networks can be used to identify drug targets, biological mediators and disease biomarkers.[51]/nCollins and collaborators discovered, using systems biology approaches, that all classes of bactericidal antibiotics induce a common oxidative damage cellular death pathway.[52] This finding indicates that targeting bacterials systems that remediate oxidative damage, including the SOS DNA damage response, is a viable means of enhancing the effectiveness of all major classes of antibiotics and limiting the emergence of antibiotic resistance. This work established a mechanistic relationship between bacterial metabolism and antibiotic efficacy, which was further developed and validated by Collins and his team in a series of follow-on studies.[53]/nCollins showed that certain metabolites could be used to enable bactericidal antibiotics to eradicate persistent, tolerant infections.[54] Additionally, Collins and co-workers discovered that sublethal levels of antibiotics activate mutagenesis by stimulating the production of reactive oxygen species, leading to multidrug resistance.[55] Collins and colleagues, using their systems approaches, also discovered a population-based resistance mechanism constituting a form of kin selection whereby a small number of resistant bacterial mutants, in the face of antibiotic stress, can, at some cost to themselves, provide protection to other more vulnerable, cells, enhancing the survival capacity of the overall population in stressful environments.[56]/nIn 2020, Collins was part of the team\u2014with fellow MIT Jameel Clinic faculty lead Professor Regina Barzilay\u2014that announced the discovery through deep learning of halicin, the first new antibiotic compound for 30 years, which kills over 35 powerful bacteria, including antimicrobial-resistant tuberculosis, the superbug C. difficile, and two of the World Health Organization's top-three most deadly bacteria.[57] In 2020, Collins, Barzilay and the MIT Jameel Clinic were also awarded funding through The Audacious Project to create the Antibiotics-AI Project and expand on the discovery of halicin in using AI to respond to the antibiotic resistance crisis through the development of new classes of antibiotics.[58]/nCollins also pioneered the development and use of nonlinear dynamical approaches to study, mimic and improve biological function,[59] expanding our ability to understand and harness the physics of living systems. Collins, for example, proposed that input noise could be used to enhance sensory function and motor control in humans.[60][61]  He and collaborators showed that touch sensation and balance control in young and older adults, patients with stroke, and patients with diabetic neuropathy could be improved with the application of sub-sensory mechanical noise,[62] e.g., via vibrating insoles.[63] This work has led to the creation of a new class of medical devices to address complications resulting from diabetic neuropathy, restore brain function following stroke, and improve elderly balance./nCollins' scientific accomplishments have been recognized by numerous awards, including the Dickson Prize in Medicine, the Sanofi-Institut Pasteur Award, the HFSP Nakasone Award, the Max Delbruck Prize, the Gabbay Award, the NIH Director's Pioneer Award, the Ellison Medical Foundation Senior Scholar Award in Aging, the inaugural Anthony J.

His research is focused on uncovering the impact of emerging diseases in marine wildlife populations including manatees, monk seals and sea turtles. He co-founded the emerging discipline of Conservation medicine, with Mary C. Pearl and Gary Tabor, expanding the One Health approach to the environment, animals and people.[5][6]/nIn a study Aguirre conducted in 2020, he searched for the exact origin of SARS-COV-2, which was unknown but the evidence pointed to the Wuhan wet market where several bats and wild animals were frequently stored and sold in close spaces and identified that in many pandemics in the past, bats were known for spreading zoonotic diseases and markets like these are the ideal conditions for viruses like COVID-19 to emerge. His research indicates that to keep future pandemics from taking place, wet markets should be banned from selling exotic animals and the illicit trade should be studied with zoonotic disease transmission and pandemics.[7] In another paper, he gave examples of vector-borne and parasitic diseases that have persisted, emerged and re-emerged in the environment, significantly harming human and animal populations all over the world. He describes how specialists in the field of transdisciplinary and socio-ecological health umbrellas have collaborated and integrated new and established techniques for disease modelling, prediction, diagnosis, treatment, control, and prevention, and that approaches like these that mainly emphasize conservation of biodiversity for health protection provide novel opportunities for increasing the efficiency and probability of success.[8] He also explored the spatial patterns of helminth parasite diversity on three main macroecological patterns and found that they may obey some of the macroecological relationships found in free-living species indicating that the parasites may provide support for the generality of these patterns and support promising counterexamples for others.[9] He co-authored and co-edited two books titled Conservation Medicine: Ecological Health in Practice[10] and New Directions in Conservation Medicine: Applied Cases of Ecological Health, providing a detailed analysis of emerging infectious diseases and pathogens from insects, plants and vertebrates. He discussed the issues of evaluating and monitoring ecological health concerns.[11]/nAguirre and Tabor first imagined a new approach in connecting traditional veterinary and human health sciences with emerging ecological health principles. This collaboration gave rise to the concept of Conservation Medicine - precursor to the global One Health/Planetary Health movements. They published with others the seminal book Conservation Medicine: Ecological Health in Practice focusing on the study of the ecological context of health.[12] According to a review by Robbie Ali in Environmental Health Perspectives, this books is \"a welcome beginning, an invitation to help build a transdisciplinary approach to the links between conservation and health in today's world\".[13] Further, Peter Hudson in the journal TREE stated \"I like to think of conservation medicine as the consequence of the human footprint on the ecological balance of disease dynamics... and drive of its contributors highlight how interdisciplinary research should be undertaken\". A second book in the subject New Directions of Conservation Medicine: Applied Cases of Ecological Health was edited by Aguirre in 2012.[14]/nIn an article, he introduced the One Health initiative to the SETAC membership and discussed the origin, evolution and utility of the approach as an organizational framework while highlighting the ways in which SETAC expertise will be able to benefit the One Health community[15] In a paper in 2019, Aguirre discussed the operational criteria for One Health, which includes the protocol used for testing vector borne diseases. He discussed two case examples with the applicability of Social Ecological Systems and Resilience (SESR).[16]/nAguirre has been active in co-developing the educational framework for the emerging field of Planetary Health, also rooted in the disciplines of Conservation Medicine, EcoHealth and One Health.[17]/nIn a book that Aguirre co-edited Tropical Conservation: Perspectives on Local and Global Priorities, he discusses the tropics and subtropics where high biodiversity has great implications for research priorities, capacity building, and policy in order to address the challenges of conserving these regions. The importance of conservation concepts along with their application are also introduced.[18] According to a review by Vojtech Novotny and Katerina Sam in Conservation Biology, \"The book provides a unique and readable exposure to conservation in Latin America, Africa, and Asia and has the potential to become a key resource on the biodiversity conservation crisis in the tropics for university professors, students, researchers, and practitioners in conservation.\"[19] In his paper on The Conservative Mosaic Approach to Reduce Corruption and the Illicit Sea Turtle Take and Trade, he discussed that although reducing corruption was not the clear goal of this initiative, he focused on how the states policies and conservation efforts made by the community sound address some of the practices that lead to corruption and endanger conservation outcomes.[20]", "8066718": "Marc, Baron Van Montagu (born 10 November 1933 in Ghent) is a Belgian molecular biologist.

From 1959 to 1961, he was research assistant at the Radiobiology Institute in Neuherberg, later in the Zoological Institute of the University of Munich. His research interests during this time gave rise to questions that later led to the foundation of the field of bionics in Germany. In 1967, he was a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley./nIn 1969, he was appointed professor and director of the Zoological Institute of Saarland University.[1] In 1990, he initiated the field of study called \"Technical Biology and Biomimetics\" (which he supervised until his retirement in 2002) and also the \"Society for Technical Biology and Bionics\" (GTBB) of which he was the first chairman until 2003.[2]/nAfter his retirement in 2002, he became head of the BMBF-funded Competence Network Biomimetics BIOKON at the University of Saarland./nBy making use of biostatistics, and also bringing together several scientific and engineering disciplines, his research which focused on mechanisms for movement in the animal kingdom led him to pioneer the field of bionics in Germany. Much of his published work centres on technology in the fields of biology, flight biomechanics and general bionics. In addition to technical scientific papers (over 300), he has published more than 30 popular books as well as articles which has stimulated interest in this emerging field./nProfessor Marianne Stokholm head of the Department of Architecture & Design at Aalborg university (AAU) Denmark, writes:[3] \"The German biologist Werner Nachtigall has since the 1960s been occupied with bionics. His writing on the subject is among the best.\"/nNachtigall formulated ten principles which he felt should undergird bionics:[4]/nThe biomechanist Steven Vogel in his book Life's devices: the physical world of animals and plants, writes, \"Wherever nature has a structure, biologists have been painstakingly describing it, but most often paying little attention to mechanical functions. Nachtigall (1974) went the next step, gathering a vast collection of structural schemes for attachment, classifying them by function, and comparing each with its technological analogs. Among interlocking joints he recognizes miters, rabbets, dovetails, and mortises; under releasable attachments he describes plugs and sockets, hooks and eyes, snaps, vises, forceps, anchors, suction cups, and others. The diversity defies summarization. Even velcro has its biological analog \u2013 what Nachtigall calls 'probabilistic' attachments, coatings of burrs invented repeatedly as a dispersal device for the seeds and fruits of plants.  All that these latter require is gentle contact with a sufficiently irregular surface (fur perhaps originally but cloth works at least as well) and enough burrs attach to provide a surprisingly strong connection. Velcro...represents highly successful bioemulation: its inventor Georges DeMestral, deliberately worked from the seed barbs of cocklebur and burdock.\"[5]", "66033325": "Susan L. Perkins is an American microbiologist and the Martin and Michele Cohen Dean of Science at The City College of New York (CCNY). Her expertise includes the pathology and genetics of malaria parasites and other haemosporidians infecting myriad non-primate species.[1]/nPerkins obtained her BA degree in Biology (minor in Chemistry), at the State University of New York at Potsdam in 1993, and graduated with her PhD in biology at the University of Vermont in 2000.[1][2] In 2018 Perkins was appointed President of the American Society of Parasitologists, having been vice-president since 2016.[1][3] She served as professor of microbial genomics and curator at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) for 15 years before joining CCNY as dean of science in 2020.[1]/nPerkins and colleague Rob DeSalle co-curated an exhibition at AMNH in 2015 entitled \"The Secret World inside You\".[4]/nIn February 2018 Perkins developed a database of PhD students, postdocs and other junior researchers for consideration as peer reviewers in ecology and evolution studies, given a lack of early-career scientists being selected for the in-demand labor.[5]/nSince early in her career, Perkins has been building phylogenetic relationships of the Plasmodium malaria parasites in order to investigate the evolutionary history of the disease-causing organisms.[6][7] This includes one of the first studies to identify the close relationship between rodent and primate malarias, the former often used in experimental research and the latter including the major human species P. falciparum.[8] Perkins' research has further expanded this analysis to include diverse species of Plasmodium from across the genus, covering less studied parasites infecting hosts such as bats and lizards.[1] By sequencing a subset of genes from the widest array of Plasmodium spp. samples at the time, Perkins' and her team found that the group is more diverse than previously thought, and that using a single generic name (that is, Plasmodium) probably isn't suitable for all the disparate lineages.[9][10] Many of the traits seen as significant for the parasites, such as the ability to reproduce asexually in the blood cells of hosts, actually originated independently multiple times.[10]/nDetailed sampling of malaria parasites in bats showed that the strains they carry are similar to those that infect other mammals, and are highly prevalent in the sampled population (about 40% of bats were infected). This suggests that bats have extreme tolerance to the infection, a feature that has been observed for other diseases and makes them potent reservoirs for cross-species (zoonotic) infection.[11][12] The lower pathogenicity in bats may be associated with how these parasites reproduce more in the liver compared to species infecting humans.[13] Furthermore, the predicted phylogenetic trajectories suggest that the parasites jumped between different host species multiple times, including between bats and rodents.[13][14]/nPerkins' investigations into malaria species infecting lizards has revealed mechanisms of infection as well as host resistance. Perkins showed in 2000 that the malaria parasite species Plasmodium azurophilum identified in Caribbean Anolis lizards is actually two separate species; one that infects red blood cells and one that uniquely infects white blood cells.[15] Green-blooded skinks in New Guinea have characteristically green-colored blood due to high levels of biliverdin bile, which would be toxic in other species but the skinks have adapted to.  This may be because it could function as anti-malarial protection, similar to the protective effect of bilirubin against human malaria, which would explain why 'green blood' may have evolved independently four times among surveyed reptiles.[16][17][18]", "59217587": "Paul Giroud (6 June 1898 \u2013 21 January 1989) was a French physician and biologist./nBorn in Munet (Moulins), Allier, France he studied and worked at the Institut Pasteur[1] in Paris./nGiroud was Head of Laboratory at the Institut Pasteur in Paris from 1930 to 1938.

Lynch had two other siblings named Alice Allen Lynch and Frances H. Lynch, both of whom also lived to adulthood.[2]/nLynch received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Smith College in 1902 and continued on to receive her doctorate degree from Columbia University in 1919.[3] In 1918, she became a part of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research as a member of the faculty, which she served for 53 years. This institute is now known as Rockefeller University.[1] Lynch taught anatomy and physiology of mammalian species while at Smith College. While at Columbia University, Lynch worked under the notable Thomas Hunt Morgan./nDuring the early parts of Lynch\u2019s career, the field of cancer research was growing rapidly, and may scientists were making huge advancements in the understanding of this disease.  She joined this field when she began her work as a faculty member at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research under James B. Murphy. Lynch was one of the first female scientists to study cancer. In the beginning, she studied mammary tumors in mice noting that some mice formed tumors more rapidly and spontaneously than others. She came to conclude that developing tumors was an inherited trait. Lynch also looked at tumors in the lungs of these mice, also coming to the conclusion that the tendency to accumulate tumors in both the mammary and lung tissue resulted from dominant inherited traits.[1] Lynch's work was often doubted by other scientific experts during this time.[1]/nLynch is also given credit for pioneering her so-called albino Swiss mouse,[4] which she used as test subjects for experiments. She actually brought back this albino Swiss mouse in 1926 from Lausanne, Switzerland, because it was easily bred in the laboratory. Dr Andr\u00e9 de Coulon (1890\u20131935), then a founding scientific director of the Centre Anti-Cancereux Romand (CACR), gave her nine (7 females and 2 males) mice from his colony raised there since 1924 (date of the CACR \u2013 Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, ISREC inception). Lynch famously brought the mice in a shoebox aboard the ship Ordu\u00f1a (a crossing from Cherbourg in France to New York lasting 13 days, September 1\u201313, 1926). The mice were not proceeded through customs with any permit from the Department of Agriculture.[5] Lynch often bred the mice and distributed them to other laboratories for research. The descendants of this type of mouse are widely used in research today.[3][6]/nOne well-known research article written by Lynch is entitled \"The Inheritance of Susceptibility to Yellow Fever Encephalitis in Mice\", which was received on October 2, 1935. She performed this research on her Swiss mice that she had brought from Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1926 to the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Technology.  In this study she looked at the importance of resistance for individuals related to the likelihood of attaining certain infectious diseases, and in this case specifically yellow fever. Some mice were more susceptible to diseases than others,[7] and Lynch wanted to see how genetic factors influenced susceptibility to yellow fever encephalitis. Lynch worked with Thomas P. Hughes, a fellow scientist in the field, and together they discovered that the sex of the mice did not determine susceptibility to yellow fever, offspring from two susceptible parents were more likely to be susceptible to yellow fever than offspring who only had resistant parent, and that overall there are hereditary factors present in mice that attribute to susceptibility to yellow fever.[7]", "67213034": "Nucharin Songsasen (Thai: \u0e19\u0e38\u0e0a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e4c \u0e28\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e30\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e19) is a research biologist and head of the Center for Species Survival at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.

When an individual absorbs phosphate from foods that are high in its bioavailability, the bone upregulates FGF23 production to induce greater urinary excretion of phosphate and minimizing the efficiency of intestinal phosphate absorption by reducing serum 1-25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels. This reduces the amount of Vitaman D, or 1-25-dihydroxyvitamin D., and this results in numerous endocrine issues, like thyroid disease, excessive inflammation, like fibrosis of the lungs, and Renal Kidney Disease (RKD) or Hyperphosphatemia.[14]/nWang's work connected high levels of IGF to the lungs overreaction to viruses, like a coronavirus, which involves excessive inflammation and resulting Acute Respiratory Distress, which can be depicted by infections like those by any coronavirus.[13] This inflammation can lead to sepsis and death, and Wang's attempt to show the relationship of phosphate related mediators like IGF, which could be evident of excessive phosphate in a diet, was to draw a connection to its likewise role in lung inflammation in cases of viral sepsis, where the patient bears a susceptibility to it because of a high phosphate diet and resulting low levels of Vitamin D.[13][15] This research by her is similar to those also attempting to show high levels of phosphate as associated with lung cancer.[16]/nFor those with kidney disease, the answer has been to reduce phosphate by taking phosphate binding substances, like calcium carbonate, in order to reduce the risk of inflammation, but for others who are subject to high phosphate levels that have not yet arisen to the level of kidney disease, the danger of lung inflammation following viral infection is possible and may explain inequitable reactions of patients with viral disease like pneumonia or coronavirus, as these person may be unaware of high phosphate levels affecting their metabolism of Vitamin D.[17]  High phosphate levels may also be unknown to those who eventually likewise succumb to lung cancer, where it has been shown to be a possible causative factor.[16] Through Wang's research, in addition to that of others, use of phosphate binders such as calcium carbonate, or a diet low in phosphate, which are treatments for those suffering from kidney disease, may provide an option for treatment.[17]/nWang became a member of the China Zhi Gong Party in 2010,[2] eventually becoming the deputy director for Wuhan in the party in 2018.[2]/nIn August 2020, Wang appeared on NBC News and denied claims by the U.S. Trump Administration that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of the COVID-19 virus, or that they had safety problems.

Through empirical studies, she examines evolutionary change in its ecological context.[17] By studying Echinacea angustifolia, she has demonstrated that inbreeding, which frequently affects fragmented populations, can influence key functional traits. Traits related to plant structure, physiology and elemental composition are important to individual fitness and ecological dynamics in populations.[18]/nWith Margaret Bryan Davis and others, Shaw has examined Paleoclimate change in North American forests, from the Quaternary period onwards. Pollen granules and other plant remains, found in  lake sediment cores, can show changes in populations in an area over time.[19][20][21] In 2011, Davis, Shaw and Julie R. Etterson received the William Skinner Cooper Award from the Ecological Society of America for the paper \"Evolutionary responses to changing climate\".[7][22] \nIn this paper, they synthesized ecological and evolutionary research about plant populations and the effects of  rapid  climate  change, challenging the paradigm that evolutionary responses in the Quaternary period were slow and ineffective. The evidence they presented suggests that evolutionary adaptation does occur in plant populations subjected to the stress of rapid environmental change.[7]/nShaw has also developed new statistical methods, such as aster modeling, with statistician Charles Geyer .[23][12][24][25]\nAster Modeling enables the analysis of life history data to obtain estimates of fitness and population growth rates.[26] The importance of Shaw's work on quantitative genetics and analysis of fitness was recognized in 2009 when the American Society of Naturalists gave its President's Award to the paper Unifying Life\u2010History Analyses for Inference of Fitness and Population Growth.[6][27]  Shaw has also developed Quercus, a quantitative genetics software, that performs a maximum likelihood analysis of variance of quantitative genetic data.[28][29]/nShaw advises graduate students in the departments of Applied Plant Sciences; Conservation Biology; Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior; and Plant Biological Sciences at the University of Minnesota.[26] Her students have assessed the effect of climate change on adaptation potential of native plants, the evolutionary consequences of gene flow from cultivated plants to naturally occurring plant relatives, and the evolutionary change in introduced species.[29]", "7804713": "Leonard Pershing Guarente (born 1952) is an American biologist best known for his research on life span extension in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, roundworms (Caenorhabditis elegans), and mice.[2][3]  He is a Novartis Professor of Biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[4]/nLeonard Guarente was born and raised in Revere, Massachusetts and was the first person in his family to attend college, when he started his undergraduate work at MIT in 1970.[5] He earned his Ph.D. at MIT, studying under Jon Beckwith and Mark Ptashne.[6] He did a post doc at Harvard.[7]/nMIT hired Guarente and he opened his own lab in 1981;[6] he earned tenure there in 1986.[5]  For the first nine years, his lab studied gene regulation in yeast.[5][6]/nIn 1991 his lab started to study genes involved in aging.[5] In 1993,  Cynthia Kenyon's lab at UCSF discovered that a single-gene mutation in (Daf-2) could double the lifespan of C. elegans.  That same year, David Sinclair joined the Guarente lab, and they developed the hypothesis that caloric restriction slows aging by activation of sirtuins.[8]  The Kenyon and Guarente labs came to lead the field studying the genetics of aging.[9]/nIn 1995 the Guarente lab identified the gene SIR4 (Silent information regulator 4) as a longevity regulator. When SIR4 was mutated in a single cell organism S. cerevisiae longevity was extended.[10] It was later determined that the complex of SIR2 and SIR4 are responsible for longevity phenotype,[11] and that over-expression of SIR2 alone was sufficient to extend lifespan. Moreover, scientists in Guarente laboratory determined that SIR2 is necessary for longevity extension by calorie restriction.[12]/nIn 1999, Guarente and Kenyon became co-founders of Elixir Pharmaceuticals, which aimed to develop drugs targeting sirtuin;[8] Guarente left the company seven years later after he disagreed with venture capitalists who had gained control of the company about the focus of the company.[13]/nIn 2000 the Guarente laboratory published work identifying SIR2's activity as a NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase. This NAD dependence explained how SIR2 could connect diet to physiology and suggested the mechanism by which calorie restriction could extend the lifespan of some organisms.[14]/nGuarente made the case that involvement of SIR2 in metabolism and lifespan is conserved in other organisms. In round worm, Guarente reported that Caenorhabditis elegans, expression of SIR2 (sir2.1) is sufficient to extend longevity[15] and in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, overexpression of SIR2 was also reported to extended lifespan.[16] However, other groups have disputed this finding and showed that SIR2-expression does not cause lifespan extension in worms or flies.[17] Overexpression of SIRT1 (mammalian sir2 homolog) does not extend lifespan.[18] Several of Guarente's high profile publications on SIRT1 have been retracted or corrected.[19]/nGuarente wrote an autobiography in 2003 titled Ageless Quest: One Scientist's Search for Genes That Prolong Youth./nGuarente's rivalry with Sinclair, which began in 2002 when Sinclair challenged Guarante's description of how sir2 might be involved in aging at a scientific meeting at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, was the subject of an article in Science in 2004.[20]/nIn 2014 Guarente co-founded the dietary supplement company Elysium Health.[13][21]", "2987820": "Margaret Carol \"Maggie\" Turnbull (born 1975) is an American astronomer and astrobiologist.[1][2] She received her PhD in Astronomy from the University of Arizona in 2004.

His studies of nonhuman primates have addressed topics such as aggression and dominance, affiliation and social bonding, communication and cognition, mating and reproduction, and parenting and development.[2][3][4][5] Some of his work has elucidated the neuroendocrine regulation of primate behavior while other research has investigated its evolutionary significance. Human research conducted in Maestripieri's laboratory at the University of Chicago has focused on three different areas: parent-child relationships, attachment, and socio-emotional development; neuroendocrine regulation of social processes and stress reactivity; evolutionary psychology and neuroeconomics.[6][7]/nMaestripieri has published six books, several popular science essays, and over 175 scientific articles. His books provide an illustration of his intellectual interests. Evolutionary Theory and Primate Behavior includes a collection of essays illustrating evolutionary analyses of major aspects of primate socioecology and behavior including feeding, social, and reproductive strategies. In Primate Psychology, Maestripieri integrates human and nonhuman primate research on many aspects of social behavior, development, communication and cognition. In Macachiavellian Intelligence: How Rhesus Macaques and Humans Have Conquered the World, he highlights the many parallels between the social behavior of rhesus macaques and human beings and explains them using evolutionary and economic cost-benefit analyses. He also suggests that complex political intelligence evolved in highly competitive primate societies played a role in the evolution of the human brain and human intelligence, as well as in our ecological success on this planet. Maternal Effects in Mammals is an edited collection of theoretical and empirical essays addressing the role of nongenetic maternal influences on phenotypic evolution in many species of mammals. In Animal Personalities: Behavior, Physiology, and Evolution, research on individual differences in behavior and reactivity to the environment in many animals and humans is discussed and integrated from a comparative and evolutionary perspective. In Games Primates Play: An Undercover Investigation of the Evolution and Economics of Human Relationships, Maestripieri illustrates how evolutionary and comparative studies, along with economic cost-benefit analyses of behavior, can explain why people behave the way they do in everyday social situations and in the negotiation of their personal and business relationships./nDario Maestripieri was awarded the B. Grassi Prize as the Best Young Zoologist from the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei in Italy in 1989, the Distinguished Scientific Award for Early Career Contribution to Psychology from the American Psychological Association in 2000[8][9] and a Career Development Award from the National Institute of Mental Health in 2001.

She investigates the molecular mechanisms that underpin lineage choice. She is an elected fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences./nRothenberg describes her upbringing as \"sex-blind\". She credits her parents with giving her a strong sense of one's potential and says her father  \"taught [her] math and logic to the point that [she] got in trouble with [her] teachers\". As a child, Rothenberg originally wanted to become a physicist, but her high school biology classes inspired her to pursue biochemistry.[1] Her high school teachers taught her about protein structure and how their structures confer biological function. While Rothenberg was an undergraduate student at Harvard University,[2] her tutor, Boris Magasanik, inspired her to work on gene regulation.[1] After earning her bachelor's degree, Rothenberg started a MD\u2013PhD program offered jointly by Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[1] She eventually dropped the MD but continued, at MIT, her PhD research with David Baltimore. She was the first to synthesize in vitro the genome of a retrovirus.[1] She completed her doctoral research in the Department of Biology and Center for Cancer Research in 1977. Rothenberg was a Jane Coffin Childs postdoctoral fellow with Edward Boyse at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.[3]/nIn 1979, Rothenberg was appointed to the faculty at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where she spent three years before moving to the California Institute of Technology.[3] Rothenberg investigates the molecular mechanisms that underpin lineage selection. This includes the processes that determine the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into T cells. There are several steps to this process, in which the multi-potentiality of stem cells are reduced whilst the T-cell specific differentiation events start.[citation needed]/nRothenberg studies the transcription factors that induce gene expression to guide development of T-lineage cells.[4] She has modeled the gene networks involved and the interactions of transcription factors and chromatin.

Upon graduation, he began his education in research at the Lister Institute in London, England./nIn 1957 he joined the newly formed Ontario Cancer Institute, where the majority of his research focused on normal blood-formation and leukaemia. Together with his colleague, Dr. J.E. Till, McCulloch created the first quantitative, clonal method to identify stem cells and used this technique for pioneering studies on stem cells. His experience in hematology, when combined with Till's experience in biophysics, yielded a novel and productive combination of skills and interests./nIn the early 1960s, McCulloch, and Till started a series of experiments that involved injecting bone marrow cells into irradiated mice.  Visible nodules were observed in the spleens of the mice, in proportion to the number of bone marrow cells injected.  Till and McCulloch called the nodules 'spleen colonies', and speculated that each nodule arose from a single marrow cell: perhaps a stem cell./nIn later work, Till & McCulloch were joined by graduate student Andy Becker, and demonstrated that each nodule did indeed arise from a single cell. They published their results in Nature in 1963. In the same year, in collaboration with Lou Siminovitch, a trailblazing Canadian molecular biologist, they obtained evidence that these cells were capable of self-renewal, a crucial aspect of the functional definition of stem cells that they had formulated.[citation needed]/nMcCulloch's later research was on cellular and molecular mechanisms affecting the growth of malignant blast stem cells obtained from the blood of patients with Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia./nIn 1969, McCulloch won the Canada Gairdner International Award with James E. Till in recognition of their development of the spleen colony technique for measuring the capacity of primitive normal and neoplastic cells to multiply and differentiate in the body.[6] This technique has been applied by them and their colleagues, and by many others, to gain important knowledge of the normal formation of blood cells, the behavior of leukemic cells and methods of treating leukemia, and other aspects of cell biology.[7]/nIn 1974, McCulloch became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.  In 1988, he became an Officer of the Order of Canada and was made a member of the Order of Ontario in 2006.

He lives in an apartment in Pasadena. As with his friends, he is mutually involved with and obsessed with science fiction and comic books in general. He is also a fan of Harry Potter and Indian music, but appreciates the Indian lullabies his mother sang and the catchiness of Hindi phrases. Unlike his male friends, Raj has many feminine interests, such as reading Archie comics and Twilight and watching chick flicks such as Bridget Jones's Diary. It is speculated that Raj might be gay due to his feminine interests and his close friendship with Howard, with whom he has arguments similar to those of a married couple. However, Raj has always stated that he is straight, but metrosexual. He was infatuated with Penny, and secretly wrote love poems about Bernadette./nRaj is a Hindu and believes in karma (reincarnation), but eats beef.

Bialik returns to play Amy in the narration of the season 4 premiere./nStuart David Bloom[12][13] (portrayed by Kevin Sussman; main: seasons 6 and 8-12; recurring: seasons 2-5 and 7) runs the Comic Center in Pasadena,[14] the comic book store that the characters often visit. Stuart is characterized by his low self-esteem and loneliness, which often result in pathetic attempts to engage with women and win favor with the gang. This is despite owning his own business and being a talented portraiture artist who attended the Rhode Island School of Design.[15]/nOne of the running gags on the show is Stuart's medical situation. It is depicted as disastrous, so much so that he can be seen under various medical treatments. He is said to have depression and possible malnutrition, among other problems. \nIn the last season, Stuart's life seems to be turning around. His comic store becomes successful and he gets a steady, long-term relationship./nKevin Sussman was a recurring guest actor from seasons two to five, and was promoted to starring role for the sixth season onwards.[16]/nEmily Sweeney, M.D., (portrayed by Laura Spencer; main: season 9; recurring: seasons 7-8; guest: season 10) is a dermatology resident at Huntington Hospital, whom Raj finds on an online dating site. Raj enlists Amy's help to be his \u201conline wingman\u201d and talk to Emily in his behalf. Amy tells Emily about this and it puts her off. Amy and Emily end up hitting it off, having both gone to Harvard and both being into quilting. While Amy and Emily are at lunch together, Raj crashes the lunch. This drives Emily away from both Raj and Amy this time. Later, Raj and Emily meet again, accidentally and hit it off. They eventually double date with Howard and Bernadette, which horrifies Howard. He and Emily had a horrible date, which ended because Howard had gas station sushi, got food poisoning and clogged and overflowed her toilet. Emily is not afraid to stand up for herself or to others when necessary. She is shown to have a slightly alarming personality trait: she delights in the macabre.\nRaj ends up breaking up with her before  Valentine's Day so he could be with Claire (Alessandra Olivia Toreson). Unfortunately for Raj, Claire had just gotten back together with her boyfriend. So, he eventually lost them both. Emily attempted to get back into Raj's good graces and did manage to sleep with him one last time, but it didn't last./nLaura Spencer was a recurring guest actress on the series in seasons seven and eight. During production of season 9, she was promoted to a \"fractional\" starring role; the upgraded status ensured her availability on an as-needed basis, without requiring her in every episode.[17] She returned as a guest in season 10./nSheldon Lee Cooper (portrayed by Iain Armitage; seasons 1-present) is a child prodigy who finishes primary school before his twin sister, Missy, and joins the same high-school class as his older brother, Georgie, at the age of nine. He reads widely and possesses an eidetic memory. He prefers to learn topics that interest him on his own\u2014such as Faraday's law of induction and gravitational lensing\u2014than the standard curriculum of grade school. In this series, the origins of his interests in the sciences, engineering, computers, trains, comic books, and science fiction (especially the character Spock from Star Trek) are revealed. Sheldon moves on to college while Missy remains in middle school. Despite their rivalry, Sheldon and Missy are closer than they first appear./nMary Cooper (n\u00e9e Tucker) [18](portrayed by Laurie Metcalf in The Big Bang Theory; recurring: seasons 7 and 9-12; guest: seasons 1 and 3-5 and by Zoe Perry in Young Sheldon; seasons 1-present) is Sheldon's short-tempered, but loving and deeply religious mother from Texas. She is able to control Sheldon, with Leonard once describing her to Penny as \"Sheldon's kryptonite\". A devout Southern Baptist, she also has two other children \u2014 Sheldon's twin sister, Missy, and brother, Georgie, who is five years older than the twins. Her husband, a rambunctious alcoholic, was also named George, but he later died in Sheldon's childhood. To Mary's relief, her other children do not share Sheldon's precociousness, even once commenting to Leonard, \"I thank the good Lord my other kids are as dumb as soup\". Mary herself is not intellectual but is quite wise, though she is prone to making outdated and insensitive remarks. She is nevertheless kind at heart and is tolerant of other faiths. Leonard wishes his mother were as loving as Sheldon's mother, although Sheldon himself appears at best ambivalent about her parenting. Sheldon mentions that Mary once hit him with a Bible because he refused to eat his Brussels sprouts. She apparently thought something was wrong with her son while he was growing up since Sheldon will often remark after someone calls him crazy, \"I'm not crazy; my mother had me tested!\" Mary confirms this, though she wishes that she had taken him to Houston for further testing./nA younger version of Mary, played by Zoe Perry, is a main character in the prequel series Young Sheldon. Perry is Metcalf's real life daughter./nGeorge Cooper Sr. is the father of Georgie, Sheldon, and Missy and the husband of Mary Tucker-Cooper. He is the high school football coach for Medford High. In The Big Bang Theory, it is established that he died when Sheldon and Missy were fourteen years old. There is currently no information on how he died, but he has shown heart attack-like symptoms and even wound up in the ER for it. He is portrayed by Lance Barber (seasons 1-present), who previously portrayed Jimmy Speckerman in one episode of The Big Bang Theory (guest: season 5). George works as a football coach./nGeorge \"Georgie\" Cooper Jr. (portrayed by Jerry O'Connell as an adult; recurring: seasons 11-12 and Montana Jordan as a youth; seasons 1-present) is Sheldon and Missy's older brother who resides in Texas and runs a car tire business. Often at odds while growing up, the Cooper brothers later reconcile their differences. George Jr. is a laid-back character who likes to make money and is a known womanizer. By season 12 of The Big Bang Theory, it is revealed that he has been twice married and divorced./nMelissa \"Missy\" Cooper (Courtney Henggeler as an adult; guest: seasons 1 & 7 & 11 and Raegan Revord as a child; seasons 1-present) is not as academically accomplished as her twin brother but displays better social skills. As a child, she was obsessed with Alf. In season three of Young Sheldon, Missy joins the baseball team in the fictional town of Medford. While Sheldon finishes high school and matriculates at university, Missy navigates the ordinary challenges of adolescence. Despite their differences, the twins are pretty close; they are both atheists./nAs an adult in The Big Bang Theory, Missy is a tall, attractive woman who promptly catches the attention of Leonard, Howard, and Raj. She occasionally visits Sheldon, whom she calls a \"rocket scientist\" to her friends, much to his annoyance. She's the only character besides Sheldon who appeared in all episodes of Young Sheldon. She was later married and had children but separated from her husband in Season 11./nConstance \"Connie\" Tucker[18] (June Squibb in The Big Bang Theory; guest: season 9 and Annie Potts in Young Sheldon; seasons 1-present) is Mary's mother, George Sr.'s mother-in-law, and maternal grandmother to Georgie, Sheldon, and Missy, who call her \"Meemaw\". Like Sheldon's other family members, she is also native to Texas and is their next-door neighbor in the town of Medford. Sheldon sees himself as her favorite grandchild, whom she affectionately calls \"Moonpie\". Sheldon, in turn, is very affectionate toward and protective of her. Meemaw is often mentioned by Sheldon but did not appear on the series until episode 14 of season nine, \"The Meemaw Manifestation\"./nIn Young Sheldon, a recurring theme is her significant gambling habit./nPastor Jeff Difford (portrayed by Matt Hobby; main: seasons 3-present; recurring: seasons 1-2) is the upbeat lead pastor of a local Baptist church in Medford that Sheldon's family attends in Young Sheldon. Like Mary, he, too, sometimes has friction with Sheldon's atheistic side but often recommends Sheldon explore his own ideas logically. Every time Sheldon challenged Pastor Jeff's beliefs, he came up short./nBilly Sparks (portrayed by Wyatt McLure; main: seasons 5-present; recurring: seasons 1-4) is a boy who lives with his parents and sister next to the Coopers and Meemaw. He has been mentioned in The Big Bang Theory as one of Sheldon's childhood bullies, although in Young Sheldon, he is rather good-natured and at times is friends with Sheldon but is shown to be extremely dim-witted./nThis section includes characters who have appeared in The Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon series with recurring role./nAlex Jensen (Margo Harshman) is a Caltech graduate student who appears in season six. Sheldon hires her to review his kindergarten and elementary-school notebooks for any possible Nobel Prize-winning research and attend to the tasks that Sheldon perceives as a waste of his own valuable time, such as buying Amy a Valentine's Day gift./nAlex takes an interest in pursuing a relationship with Leonard (despite his involvement with Penny), though he is oblivious to her romantic overtures. After she asks him out on a date, to which Leonard is flattered and Penny is jealous, Sheldon views this as an unacceptable distraction from her job. Alex files a harassment complaint against Sheldon after he attempts to give her a \"talking to\" involving unthinkingly sexist language and showing her a picture book of sexually diseased genitals. After Sheldon apologizes to Alex for his behavior, he tasks her with taking an online sexual harassment course he was mandated to take by the Human Resources department./nAlthea (Vernee Watson) is a nurse and receptionist at the hospital. She operated the sperm clinic during the original (unaired) Pilot episode when Leonard and Sheldon were considering donating.

In Season 4 when Howard had a 'mishap' with a robot arm, she free him by shutting off the computer./nAnu (Rati Gupta) is the woman who Raj's father wants him to marry. She first appears in season 12 and works at a hotel as a concierge./nArthur Jeffries, or Professor Proton (Bob Newhart), is the star of a fictional in-universe science show that Sheldon and Leonard watched as children. The character is a homage to Mr. Wizard.[20] After the show was cancelled, Jeffries was not taken seriously as a scientist and resorted to doing children's parties as his persona. When Sheldon asks for his wisdom, Jeffries tells Sheldon to appreciate everything in life, including his friends, and never take it for granted./nFor his role as Jeffries, in 2013, Newhart won his first Primetime Emmy Award. Newhart plays the same character on Young Sheldon./nBarry Kripke, PhD (John Ross Bowie) is a colleague working in plasma physics who frequently clashes with Sheldon. Kripke has a case of rhotacism in which he pronounces the letters \"R\" and \"L\" as \"W\" in much the same way as Elmer Fudd from Looney Tunes, Jimmy Five from Monica's Gang and Gilda Radner in her \"Baba Wawa\" sketches./nProfessor Bertram Kibbler (Brian Posehn) is a geologist at Caltech, who met Amy while she was working there in her own lab in \"The Occupation Recalibration\". He made various other appearances, including forming a band with Raj and Howard in which he sang a song from the point of view of the boulder seen near the beginning of the movie Raiders of the Lost Ark. After Raj stopped accepting his father's money to become financially independent, he moved into the room above Bert's garage./nBeverly Hofstadter (Christine Baranski) is Leonard's unloving, emotionally/psychologically abusive and overly analytical mother who works as a neuroscientist, as well as a psychiatrist. She is Sheldon's female equivalent regarding neurotically strict speech patterns, disregard for social conventions, and compulsive attention to detail. The lack of Beverly's maternal feelings and actions toward Leonard has led to him having an obsessive need to please. Mrs. Hofstadter and Mrs. Cooper do not get along./nFor her role as Beverly, in both 2009 and 2010, Baranski was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series./nClaire (Alessandra Torresani) is a writer for a children's science fiction series whom Raj and Howard meet in the comic book store in season 9. Claire wants to collaborate with Raj on the science portions of a movie script./nChen (James Hong) is an elderly waiter at the Golden Dragon in Season 1 until it was revealed to be shut down the following season.

He is recently divorced, his wife having had an affair with a French chef, which he remains bitter over. To Amy's horror, he is an avid fan of Sheldon's work, constantly asking questions about him after learning that he and Amy dated./nDenise (Lauren Lapkus) is the assistant manager at Stuart's comic book store introduced in season 11. She is quite a comic book geek. At first, Sheldon does not like the change that her hiring brings to the store but starts to like her because of her comic book knowledge and her ability to figure out his preferences in comic books. By Season 12, she and Stuart enter into a relationship after he takes her as his plus-one to Sheldon and Amy's wedding./nEric Gablehauser (Mark Harelik) is the head of the Physics Department, making him the boss of the guys.

She first appears in season six after Sheldon offends his assistant Alex while trying to deal with her crush on Leonard, leaving Mrs. Davis to handle Alex's sexual harassment complaint against Sheldon.

She has social anxiety issues, which allows Raj and her to connect./nOriginally, Kate Micucci had been one of the actresses considered for the Amy Farrah Fowler character./nMike Rostenkowski (Casey Sander) is Bernadette's father and a retired police officer. Mike has a rough and rude personality and often bullies others, although he deeply loves his daughter, calling Bernadette his \"little girl\". Before he is first seen, Bernadette establishes his personality by telling Howard a long list of subjects he cannot discuss with Mike, including Jimmy Carter, foreigners, homosexuals, and even Howard's Jewish identity. Mike oddly enough gets on very well with Sheldon, filling a role in his life vacated by his deceased father, George./nPresident Siebert (Joshua Malina) is the president of the California Institute of Technology. Often mentioned by Sheldon, a recurring gag is that Sheldon often calls or visits Siebert in the middle of the night to get information and usually gets a bitter response. In season eleven, the president returns to support Sheldon and Amy's work in physics./nPriya Koothrappali (Aarti Mann) is Raj's younger sister. Having graduated at the top of her class at the University of Cambridge (where, like Leonard, her roommate was from Texas), she is one of the lead attorneys at India's biggest car company. Leonard and Priya date for much of season 4 and part of 5 when she moves to Los Angeles, but break up when Priya moves back to India and cheats on Leonard./nRamona Nowitzki, Ph.D. (Riki Lindhome) first appears in the season 2 episode \"The Cooper\u2013Nowitzki Theorem\", when she is a graduate student at Caltech.  She is a huge fan of Sheldon's work and develops a crush on him. She blew him off after Sheldon refused to share credit with her on a theorem he developed. She later reemerged in the Season 10 finale where she kissed him, only for him to further pursue Amy and propose to her./nRuchi (Swati Kapila) is a new co-worker of Bernadette's at Zangen who first appears in season 11. Ruchi used to live in India, and was in an arranged engagement, until she broke off the engagement and moved to America./nStephanie Barnett, MD (Sara Rue) is a doctor and highly distinguished surgical resident at Fremont Memorial. She did her medical internship at Lawrence Memorial in Galveston, Texas, which is where Sheldon was born.[23]/nStephanie is picked up in a bar by Howard, but when his plan to let her drive the Mars rover fails, she leaves the Mars Rover lab with Leonard and the two immediately show an attraction to each other.[24] Howard becomes angry when he finds out, but he soon changes his mind when Stephanie sets Howard up with one of her friends. Sheldon begins meddling in Stephanie and Leonard's new relationship in an effort to strengthen it since in his eyes, Stephanie is the only \"tolerable\" mate Leonard has had.[23] After several weeks of dating, Stephanie officially begins living with Leonard in Sheldon and his apartment (although Leonard does not realize this until Sheldon and Penny point it out to him). Stephanie uses sex to manipulate Leonard when he tries to slow down the relationship. After much hesitation, Leonard texts her at the university and tells her to move out because he is uncomfortable with the pace of the relationship, although he apparently leaves to have sex with her. They are not seen breaking up on camera and she is neither seen nor mentioned again.[25]/nSeries cocreator Bill Prady said of the relationship: \"Stephanie was a chance for Leonard to learn that just because someone loves you, doesn't mean you'll love them back\".[26]/nWil Wheaton plays a fictionalized version of himself. Wil played Wesley Crusher in Star Trek: The Next Generation, a character that Sheldon idolized as a child. In 1995, Wheaton made Sheldon's \"mortal enemy\" list after the former failed to show up at a fan convention as advertised. Sheldon took a 10-hour bus ride to attend the convention, while breaking his own personal rule of using the facilities on board the bus, and was disappointed that Wheaton was a no-show./nDuring a Mystic Warlords of Ka-ha match at Stuarts comic book store, Sheldon sought revenge against Wheaton by beating him in the game. After revealing that he was at the Dixie Trek convention, Wheaton made a sob story of his grandmothers passing. Sheldon bought the act and threw the game only to find out that Wheaton lied and won the match.

They meet with Leonard and Penny and they want Leonard to father their child since Zack is infertile./nMrs. Debbie[27] Malvina[28] Wolowitz (voiced by Carol Ann Susi) is Howard's over-protective, controlling, belittling, but loving and caring stereotypical Jewish mother. The character is not shown on-screen with only two exceptions: firstly in one episode in season six where her body but not her face is briefly shown, and secondly in the Season 5 finale where she can be seen (albeit very small) in the Google Earth satellite picture taken during Howard and Bernadette's wedding. Mrs. Wolowitz's raspy voice is heard usually in scenes at her house, which she shares with Howard. She talks to Howard always by yelling at him from another room, which results in awkward conversations with Howard yelling back at her. In a flashback, when the guys hear her yelling in a masculine voice, they ask Howard if that was his father, to which Howard replies, \"If she grows any more hair on her face, yes.\" Mrs. Wolowitz is also described as being enormously obese and wearing a wig and painted-on eyebrows. She seems to be oblivious to Howard's work as an engineer and treats him as though he is still a child. She is a master at Wheel of Fortune and guessing answers at game shows. She frequently refers to Leonard, Sheldon, and Raj as Howard's \"little friends\" (as in, \"I made some cookies and Hawaiian Punch for you and your little friends!\") and often refers to Caltech as a \"school\". Howard often makes references to his mother as being a \"crazy old lady\", but deep down he is deeply attached to her and quite happy to be treated like a child. She is also noted to be on hormone replacement therapy, and she wants to \"play doctor\" with Raj when he asks to sleep over./nDue to the death of her actress, Mrs. Wolowitz character is retired with the fact that she passed away in her sleep while visiting family.

(Wyatt reveals that he favors the successful Leonard over Penny's other \"loser\" boyfriends.)/nZack Johnson (Brian Thomas Smith) is a dim-witted but friendly beefcake type whom Penny dates on and off after her second break-up with Leonard. He takes a lively interest in the boys' scientific exploits, but sometimes (and much to Penny's disgust) becomes the butt of their jokes. He did attend college, though it is safe to say that he was a pure jock./nZack works as the menu designer for restaurants that are owned by or which have hired his father's company to design their menus. Later, Penny and Zach go out to a party, but she is so put off at how stupid he is that she runs back to Leonard for sex, saying he ruined her ability to tolerate stupid men. In season four, Zack runs into Penny, Bernadette, and Amy at a restaurant, and Amy becomes physically attracted to him. Sheldon arranges a meeting between Zack and Amy to satisfy her \"urges\", but his lack of intellect immediately discourages Amy./nLater, Penny runs into Zack again after he buys her, Bernadette and Amy drinks. He reveals that he has sold his menu company and become rich from the profits, and invites her and Leonard to dinner at his yacht with him and his new wife, Marissa Johnson./nBrenda Sparks (Melissa Peterman) is Billy Sparks's mother who works at the bowling alley frequented by Meemaw.

In the fourth season, he and Brenda get a divorce./nPaige Swanson (Mckenna Grace) is a 10-year-old child prodigy whom Sheldon meets in one of his classes with Dr. Sturgis. As his rival, she teases him about differentiating under the integral sign. She has higher social skills than Sheldon and is capable of being friends with nonintellectuals.

He attempts to console her by making her a hot beverage./nRobin (Mary Grill) is a police officer and Pastor Jeff's second wife.

In most cases, the appearances are brief cameo appearances. These appearances are in contrast to Wil Wheaton who, as described above, plays a character on the show which is a fictionalized version of himself.", "2299773": "Max Carl Anton F\u00fcrbringer (January 30, 1846 \u2013 March 6, 1920) was a German anatomist, known for his anatomical investigations of vertebrates and especially for his studies in ornithology on avian morphology and classification. He was responsible for the first major phylogenetic ordering of bird groups based on a large scale study on a combination of skeletal, morphological and anatomical characteristics./nMax was the first son of Hermine and Karl F\u00fcrbringer. Although he was born in Wittenberg, his father's government employment involved travel and he was raised by relatives in Gera. Max was taught and influenced by Karl Theodor Liebe, a bird enthusiast who kept many kinds of birds. Max spent his early childhood collecting coins, butterflies, bees, mosses and ferns. Max's brother Paul would later become an eminent physicist. Max studied at the universities of Berlin and Jena, where he was a student of Carl Gegenbaur.[1][2] F\u00fcrbringer would be one of Gegenbaur's most ardent disciples and supporters. One of F\u00fcrbringer teachers was Ernst Haeckel about whom he wrote glowingly:\n\"He stepped into the auditorium, not with the measured step of the professor, but with the triumphant charging-along of an Apollonian youth, hurrying toward the cathedral, a tall, slender, impressive form; ... golden, flying locks, large, blue, flashing eyes\u2014probably the most beautiful man that I had ever seen, and it seemed to me as if the room, which had already been bright, became noticeably brighter...\"[3]\nHe obtained his doctorate with a thesis on the muscles and bones of dinosaurs. He later worked as a prosector under Gegenbaur at the University of Heidelberg, followed by professorships in Amsterdam, Jena (from 1888) and Heidelberg (from 1901).[4] In 1901 he replaced Gegenbaur at Heidelberg as professor and stayed on until 1912 when his student (and later son-in-law) Hermann Braus took over. He then served as an au\u00dferordentliche (=extraordinary) professor at the University of Marburg.[5][6]/nIn 1888 F\u00fcrbringer published a monumental two volume work on the systematics of birds groups. The first volume was on the forelimbs and shoulder girdle of vertebrates while the second examined the characters and systematics of bird groups. One of the ideas that he used was that the connection of the nerve to a muscle tends to be conserved with evolution.[7] He made use of 51 anatomical and morphological characters and compared every pair of bird group and deduced an evolutionary tree of all the extant and extinct bird groups. His evolutionary tree branched in three dimensions which he represented by means of side and cross-sectional views. This representation was probably influenced by the work of Adolf Engler on plants.[8] This was a seminal work in bird systematics which underwent modifications by Hans Gadow and others to become a definitive basis for subsequent work on the avian evolutionary tree well until the arrival of molecular techniques.[9][10][11][12][13]/nAs a defender of Gegenbaur, F\u00fcrbringer went against Carl Rabl in 1901. This long drawn conflict relating to the archipterygium or how the fin and the limb were related based on conflicting evidence from anatomy and embryology descended into polemical attacks on each other.[5]", "73275265": "Anthony \"Tony\" Peter John Trinci (1936, Swindon \u2013 7 October 2020) was a British mycologist, botanist, and microbiologist.

He described an inherited deficiency in leukocyte adhesion in a lead article in the New England Journal of Medicine;[1] defined the biochemical and molecular basis of this disease, which he traced to a deficiency in a family of leukocyte surface glycoprotein receptors, now known as leukocyte \u03b22 integrins[2][3] and elucidated the role of these cell adhesion molecules in the immune system.[4] He was also the first to determine the crystal structures of integrins.[5][6][7][8][9] His molecular and structural studies in integrins were instrumental in understanding the processes involved in organ development, maintenance of organ architecture and homeostasis in the adult, cancer growth and metastasis, and the response of organs to acute and chronic inflammatory or autoimmune injury. For example, in the kidney, integrins are now known to be critical in maintaining the kidney filtration barrier thus preventing loss of blood and proteins in the urine,[10] and also mediate the respiratory distress observed in kidney failure patients when hemodialyzed using cuprophane membranes.[11] Arnaout's current research aims at translating his discoveries in integrin biology and structure into novel and safer drugs for treating inflammatory, thrombotic, fibrotic and autoimmune diseases and cancer, using structure-based drug design.[12][13][14][15]/nHis research on cell adhesion and integrins has been described as \"concomitantly advancing the field one enormous stride,\"[16] as \"one of those spectacular results that will change a field\",[17] a \"MIDAS touch to cell signaling\"[18] and has been featured in the lay press including the New York Times.[19] His two research papers published in the journal Science are the two most quoted in the integrin field for the past 20 years./nArnaout was the first to show that C3 nephritic factor is an autoantibody to the complement C3bBb convertase that activates the alternative complement pathway,[20][21] a finding that suggested the potential of B cell or complement C5 depletion as adjunct therapies in certain forms of kidney inflammation. He was also the first to identify the antigen targeted by autoantibodies in patients with systemic vasculitis,[22] which formed the basis for a routinely used diagnostic assay. He was the first to show that polycystin-1, one of two gene products mutated in patients with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD), is required for the structural integrity of blood vessels,[23] indicating that the early onset of high blood pressure and presence of vascular aneurysms in ADPKD is caused by a primary defect in vascular polycystin-1. In collaborative studies, he also showed that polycystin-2, the other gene product defective in ADPKD,  is a TRP-like calcium channel,[24] providing new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of ADPKD.", "10131339": "Bernard Zab\u0142ocki (January 1, 1907 in Navahrudak \u2013 March 3, 2002 in Delta, British Columbia) was a Polish microbiologist and immunologist.

Just's primary legacy is his recognition of the fundamental role of the cell surface in the development of organisms. In his work within marine biology, cytology and parthenogenesis, he advocated the study of whole cells under normal conditions, rather than simply breaking them apart in a laboratory setting./nBorn to Charles Jr. and Mary Matthews Just on August 14, 1883, Just was one of five children. His father and grandfather, Charles Sr., were  builders. When Just was four years old, both his father and grandfather died (the former of alcoholism).[1] Just's mother became the sole supporter of Just, his younger brother, and his younger sister. Mary Matthews Just taught at an African-American school in Charleston to support her family. During the summer, she worked in the phosphate mines on James Island. Noticing that there was much vacant land near the island, Mary persuaded several black families to move there to farm. The town they founded, now incorporated in the West Ashley area of Charleston, was eventually named Maryville in her honor.[2]/nWhen Just was young, he became severely sick for six weeks with typhoid. Once the fever passed, he had a hard time recuperating, and his memory had been greatly affected. He had previously learned to read and write, but now had to relearn. His mother had been very sympathetic in teaching him, but after a while she gave up.[3]/nHoping Just would become a teacher, at the age of 13 his mother sent him to the \"Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina\", the only 1890 land grant school for the education of Negroes in South Carolina, later known as South Carolina State University in Orangeburg, South Carolina. Believing that schools for blacks in the south were inferior, Just and his mother thought it better for him to go north. At the age of 16, Just enrolled at the Meriden, New Hampshire, college-preparatory high school Kimball Union Academy. During Just's second year at Kimball, he returned home for a visit only to learn that his mother had been buried an hour before he arrived.[3] Despite this hardship, Just completed the four-year program in only three years and graduated in 1903 with the highest grades in his class.[4]/nJust went on to graduate magna cum laude from Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, class of 1907.[5] There, Just developed an interest in biology after learning about fertilization and egg development.[6] Just won special honors in zoology, and distinguished himself in botany, history, and sociology as well. He was also honored as a Rufus Choate scholar for two years and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.[4] Just was also a candidate to deliver a commencement speech, but was not chosen because the faculty \"decided it would be a faux pas to allow the only black in the graduating class to address the crowd of parents, alumni, and benefactors. It would have made too glaring the fact, that Just had won just about every prize imaginable,\"[3] including honors in botany, sociology, and history.[6] While teaching at Howard University, Just earned a PhD in 1916 from the University of Chicago, becoming the first African American to do so.[7]/nOn November 17, 1911, Ernest Just and three Howard University students (Edgar Amos Love, Oscar James Cooper, and Frank Coleman), established the Omega Psi Phi fraternity on the campus of Howard. Love, Cooper, and Coleman had approached Just about establishing the first black fraternity on campus. Howard's faculty and administration initially opposed the idea of establishing the fraternity, fearing that it could pose a political threat to Howard's white administration. However, Just worked to mediate the controversy and, despite the initial doubts, Omega Psi Phi, Alpha Chapter, was chartered on Howard's campus on December 15, 1911. Omega Psi Phi was incorporated under the laws of the District of Columbia on October 28, 1914.[1]/nWhen he graduated from Dartmouth, Just faced the same problems all black college graduates of his time did: no matter how brilliant they were or how high their grades were, it was almost impossible for black people to become faculty members at white colleges or universities. Just took what seemed to be the best choice available to him and accepted a teaching position at historically black Howard University in Washington, D.C. In 1907, Just first began teaching rhetoric and English, fields somewhat removed from his specialty. By 1909, however, he was teaching not only English but also Biology.[8] In 1910, he was put in charge of a newly formed biology department by Howard's president, Wilbur P. Thirkield and, in 1912, he became head of the new Department of Zoology, a position he held until his death in 1941./nNot long after beginning his appointment at Howard, Just was introduced to Frank R. Lillie, the head of the Department of Zoology at the University of Chicago. Lillie, who was also director of the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, invited Just to spend the summer of 1909 as his research assistant at the MBL. During this time and later, Just's experiments focused mainly on the eggs of marine invertebrates. He investigated the fertilization reaction and the breeding habits of species such as Platynereis megalops, Nereis limbata, and Arbacia punctulata. For the next 20 or so years, Just spent every summer but one at the MBL./nWhile at the MBL, Just learned to handle marine invertebrate eggs and embryos with skill and understanding, and soon his expertise was in great demand by both junior and senior researchers alike.[9] In 1915, Just took a leave of absence from Howard to enroll in an advanced academic program at the University of Chicago. That same year, Just, who was gaining a national reputation as an outstanding young scientist, was the first recipient of the NAACP's Spingarn Medal, which he received on February 12, 1915. The medal recognized his scientific achievements and his \"foremost service to his race.\"[3]/nHe began his graduate training with coursework at the MBL: in 1909 and 1910 he took courses in invertebrate zoology and embryology, respectively, there. His coursework continued in-residence at the University of Chicago.  His duties at Howard delayed the completion of his coursework and his receipt of the Ph.D. degree.[9] However, in June 1916, Just received his degree in zoology, with a thesis on the mechanics of fertilization. Just thereby became one of only a handful of blacks who had gained the doctoral degree from a major university. By the time he received his doctorate from Chicago, he had already published several research articles, both as a single author and a co-author with Lillie.[8] During his tenure at Woods Hole, Just rose from student apprentice to internationally respected scientist. A careful and meticulous experimentalist, he was regarded as \"a genius in the design of experiments.\"[10] He had explored other areas including: experimental parthenogenesis, cell division, cell hydration and dehydration, UV carcinogenic radiation on cells, and physiology of development.[6]/nJust, however, became frustrated because he could not obtain an appointment at a major American university. He wanted a position that would provide a steady income and allow him to spend more time with his research. Just's scientific career involved a constant struggle for an opportunity for research, \"the breath of his life\". He was condemned by racism to remain attached to Howard, an institution that could not give full opportunity to ambitions such as the ones Just had due to budgetary constraints of the era.[9] Nevertheless, Just was able to make significant contributions to his field during this period, including co-authoring the textbook General Cytology, first published in June 1924, with other pioneers in cell biology, including Clarence Erwin McClung, Margaret Reed Lewis, Thomas Hunt Morgan and Edmund Beecher Wilson.[11] In 1929, Just traveled to Naples, Italy, where he conducted experiments at the prestigious zoological station \"Anton Dohrn\"./nThen, in 1930, he became the first American to be invited to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin-Dahlem, Germany, where several Nobel Prize winners carried out research. Altogether from his first trip in 1929 to his last in 1938, Just made ten or more visits to Europe to pursue research. Scientists treated him like a celebrity and encouraged him to extend his theory on the ectoplasm to other species.[9] Just enjoyed working in Europe because he did not face as much discrimination there in comparison to the U.S. and when he did encounter racism, it invariably came from Americans.[3]\nBeginning in 1933, when the Nazis began to take the control Germany, Just ceased his work there. He moved his European-based studies to Paris and to the marine laboratory at the French fishing village of Roscoff, located on the English channel./nJust authored two books, Basic Methods for Experiments on Eggs of Marine Animals (1939) and The Biology of the Cell Surface (1939), and he also published at least seventy papers in the areas of cytology, fertilization and early embryonic development.[12] He discovered what is known as the fast block to polyspermy; he further elucidated the slow block, which had been discovered by Fol in the 1870s; and he showed that the adhesive properties of the cells of the early embryo are surface phenomena exquisitely dependent on developmental stage.[13] He believed that the conditions used for experiments in the laboratory should closely match those in nature; in this sense, he can be considered to have been an early ecological developmental biologist.[14] His work on experimental parthenogenesis informed Johannes Holtfreter's concept of \"autoinduction\"[15] which, in turn, has broadly influenced modern evolutionary and developmental biology.[16] His investigation of the movement of water into and out of living egg cells (all the while maintaining their full developmental potential) gave insights into internal cellular structure that is now being more fully elucidated using powerful biophysical tools and computational methods.[17][18][19][20] These experiments anticipated the non-invasive imaging of live cells that is being developed today. Although Just's experimental work showed an important role for the cell surface and the layer below it, the \"ectoplasm,\" in development, it was largely and unfortunately ignored.[3][21] This was true even with respect to scientists who emphasized the cell surface in their work. It was especially true of the Americans; with the Europeans, he fared somewhat better.[9]/nOn June 12, 1912, he married Ethel Highwarden, who taught German at Howard University. They had three children: Margaret, Highwarden, and Maribel. The two divorced in 1939.[6] That same year, Just married Hedwig Schnetzler, who was a philosophy student he met in Berlin.[6]/nIn 1940, Just was imprisoned by German Nazis, but was easily released thanks to the help of his wife's father.[6]/nAt the outbreak of World War II, Just was working at the Station Biologique in Roscoff, researching the paper that would become Unsolved Problems of General Biology. Although the French government requested foreigners to evacuate the country, Just remained to complete his work. In 1940, Germany invaded France, and Just was briefly imprisoned in a prisoner-of-war camp. With the help of the family of his second wife, a German citizen, he was rescued by the U.S. State Department and he returned to his home country in September 1940. However, Just had been very ill for months prior to his encampment and his condition deteriorated in prison and on the journey back to the U.S. In the fall of 1941, he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and died shortly thereafter.[22]/nJust was the subject of the 1983 biography Black Apollo of Science: The Life of Ernest Everett Just by Kenneth R. Manning. The book received the 1983 Pfizer Award and was a finalist for the 1984 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography.[23][24] In 1996, the U.S. Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp honoring Just.[25]/nBeginning in 2000, the Medical University of South Carolina has hosted the annual Ernest E. Just Symposium to encourage non-white students to pursue careers in biomedical sciences and health professions.[26] In 2008, a National Science Foundation-funded symposium honoring Just and his scientific work was held on the campus of Howard University, where he was a faculty member from 1907 until his death in 1941. Many of the speakers at the symposium contributed papers to a special issue of the journal Molecular Reproduction and Development dedicated to Just that was published in 2009./nSince 1994, the American Society for Cell Biology has given an award[27] and hosted a lecture in Just's name. At least two of the institutions with which Just was associated have established prizes or symposia in his name: The University of Chicago,[28] where Just received his PhD (in zoology, in 1916), and Dartmouth College, where he received his undergraduate degree. In 2013, an international symposium honoring Just was held at the Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn in Naples, Italy, where Just had worked starting in 1929.[29][30][31][32]/nIn 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante included Just on his list of the 100 Greatest African Americans.[33] A children's book about Just, titled The Vast Wonder of the World: Biologist Ernest Everett Just, written by M\u00e9lina Mangal and illustrated by Luisa Uribe, was published by Millbrook Press in November 2018./nJust believed that \"life as an event lies in a combination of chemical stuffs exhibiting physical properties; and it is in this combination, i.e., its behavior and activities, and in it alone that we can seek life.\".[34] He also wrote: \"[L]ife is the harmonious organization of events, the resultant of a communion of structures and reactions\",[13] and \"We [scientists] have often striven to prove life as wholly mechanistic, starting with the hypothesis that organisms are machines! Living substance is such because it possesses this organization--something more than the sum of its minutest parts\"[35] He argued forcefully that the \"ectoplasm,\" the outer region of the cytoplasm, and not the nucleus, constitutes the heart of the dynamic cell. He was convinced that the surface of the egg cell possesses an \"independent irritability,\" which enables the egg (and all cells) to respond productively to diverse stimuli.[36]", "48568229": "Yi Zuo is a neuroscience professor and researcher born in China.

Germ cells undergo a complex differentiation process and become male and female gametes.[6] Hazelrigg has investigated how genes are regulated within the stem cells of germs and how this regulation is impacted by differentiation.[6] She discovered the histone-lysine methyltransferase dSETDB1, which is located in the pericentric heterochromatin and catalyzes the methylation of histone H3 at its K9 residue (H3K9). In the absence of this gene, germline-stem cells are not maintained in adult Drosophila in both the ovaries and the testes. She is investigating the gene targets of dSETDB1 and the mechanisms by which dSETDB1 identifies the targets in the genome.[6]/nIn September 2019, Hazelrigg and her husband, Martin Chalfie, were awarded honorary degrees from Connecticut College.[7]/nIn 1989 Hazelrigg married Martin Chalfie.[8] Chalfie was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery and development of green fluorescent protein.[9]", "51779501": "Sushil Kumar (14 December 1940 \u2013 2 May 2021) was an Indian geneticist and academic, known for his Plant and microbial genetical genomics, especially the studies on Escherichia coli and Lambda phage as well as on the mutants of Rhizobium.[2] He was a former director of the Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and an elected fellow of the Indian National Science Academy, National Academy of Agricultural Sciences, National Academy of Sciences, India, and Indian Academy of Sciences.[3] The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 1981, for his contributions to biological sciences.[4]/nSushil Kumar, born on 14 December 1940 in the Indian capital of Delhi, did his schooling at Municipal Primary School and Dayanand Anglo-Vedic Public School, both Delhi-based schools, and graduated in science from Hansraj College, Delhi in 1960.[5] He joined the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) for his post graduate studies from where he obtained his master's degree (MSc) in 1962 under the guidance of S.

He was a leader among those British biologists who investigated the role of natural selection in nature. As a schoolboy Ford became interested in lepidoptera, the group of insects which includes butterflies and moths. He went on to study the genetics of natural populations, and invented the field of ecological genetics. Ford was awarded the Royal Society's Darwin Medal in 1954. In the wider world his best known work is Butterflies (1945)./nFord was born in Dalton-in-Furness, near Ulverston, in Lancashire, England, in 1901. He was the only child of Harold Dodsworth Ford (1864\u20131943), a classics teacher turned Anglican clergyman, and his wife (and second cousin) Gertrude Emma Bennett.[2] His paternal grandfather, Dr Henry Edmund Ford (1821\u20131909), was a \"professor\" (= teacher) of music at Carlisle[3][4] and the organist of Carlisle Cathedral from 1842 to 1902.[5][6][7] Ford was educated at St Bees School, Cumberland (now Cumbria), and read zoology at Wadham College, Oxford, (where his father had also studied),[8] graduating B.A. in 1924, upgraded to M.A. 1927, B.Sc. (a research degree) in 1927, and taking a D.Sc in 1943.[9]/nFord's career was based entirely at the University of Oxford. The biologist Arthur Cain said Ford took a degree in classics before turning to zoology.[10] Ford read zoology at Oxford, and was taught genetics by Julian Huxley. \"The lecturer whose interests most closely reflected mine was Julian Huxley. I owe him a great debt, especially for inspiration... Even though Huxley was... only at Oxford from 1919 to 1925, he was the most powerful voice in developing the selectionist attitude there... I met Ray Lankester through E.B. Poulton. He was already an old man... but talked to me a good deal of Charles Darwin and Pasteur, both of whom he knew.\"[11]/nFord was appointed University Demonstrator in Zoology in 1927 and Lecturer at University College, Oxford, in 1933. Specialising in genetics, he was appointed University Reader in Genetics in 1939 and was the Director of the Genetics Laboratory, 1952\u20131969, and Professor of Ecological Genetics 1963\u20131969. Ford was one of the first scientists to be elected a Fellow of All Souls College since the seventeenth century./nFord had a long working relationship with R.A. Fisher.[12] By the time Ford had developed his formal definition of genetic polymorphism,[13] Fisher had got accustomed to high selection values in nature. He was most impressed by the fact that polymorphism concealed powerful selective forces (Ford gave human blood groups as an example). Like Fisher, he continued the natural selection versus genetic drift debate with Sewall Wright, whom Ford believed put too much emphasis on genetic drift. It was as a result of Ford's work, as well as his own, that Dobzhansky changed the emphasis in the third edition of his famous text from drift to selection.[14]/nFord was an experimental naturalist who wanted to test evolution in nature. He virtually invented the field of research known as ecological genetics. His work on the wild populations of butterflies and moths was the first to show that the predictions made by R.A. Fisher were correct. He was the first to describe and define genetic polymorphism, and predicted that human blood group polymorphisms might be maintained in the population by providing some protection against disease.[15] Six years after this prediction it was found to be so,[16] and furthermore, heterozygous advantage was decisively established by a study of AB x AB crosses.[17] His magnum opus was Ecological Genetics, which ran to four editions and was widely influential.[18] He laid much of the groundwork for subsequent studies in this field, and was invited as a consultant to help set up similar research groups in several other countries./nAmongst Ford's many publications, perhaps the most popularly successful was the first book in the New Naturalist series, Butterflies.[19] Ford also went on in 1955 to write Moths[20] in the same series, one of only a few to have authored more than one book in the series./nFord became Professor, and then Emeritus Professor of Ecological Genetics, University of Oxford. He was a Fellow of All Souls College, and Honorary Fellow of Wadham College. He was elected FRS in 1946, and awarded the Darwin Medal in 1954./nE.B. Ford worked for many years on genetic polymorphism.[13] Polymorphism in natural populations is frequent; the key feature is the occurrence together of two or more discontinuous forms of a species in some kind of balance. So long as the proportions of each form is above mutation rate, then selection must be the cause. As early as 1930 Fisher had discussed a situation where, with alleles at a single locus, the heterozygote is more viable than either homozygote. That is a typical genetic mechanism for causing this type of polymorphism. The work involves a synthesis of field observations, taxonomy, and laboratory genetics.[18][21]/nFord was the supervisor of Bernard Kettlewell during Kettlewell's famous experiments on the evolution of melanism in the peppered moth, Biston betularia./nThe entomologist Michael Majerus discussed criticisms that had been made of Kettlewell's experimental methods in his 1998 book Melanism: Evolution in Action.[22] This book was misrepresented in reviews, and the story was picked up by creationist campaigners. In her controversial book Of Moths and Men, Judith Hooper (2002) gave a critical account of Ford's supervision and relationship with Kettlewell, and implied that the work was fraudulent or at least incompetent. Careful studies of Kettlewell's surviving papers by Rudge (2005) and Young (2004) found Hooper's suggestion of fraud to be unjustified, and that \"Hooper does not provide one shred of evidence to support this serious allegation\".[23][24] Majerus himself described Of Moths and Men as \"littered with errors, misrepresentations, misinterpretations and falsehoods\". He concludes/nKettlewell and Helen Spurway, then the graduate student (and later the wife) of J.B.S. Haldane, were known to have shocked Ford by catching live moths as they flitted around a light, popping them in their mouths, and eating them whole.[25] Haldane, who did not like Ford, was of the opinion that Ford and Kettlewell had attempted to capitalise on the supposed evolutionary adaptation of the main two variants of the peppered moth, for which Haldane, as early as 1924, had predicted the statistical probability of rate of change from light to melanic forms as an example of classic Mendelian genetics. In 1961, Haldane and Spurway talked to Canadian lepidopterist Gary Botting about the peppered moth and the unlikelihood of Ford and Kettlewell obtaining results that approximated Haldane's 1924 statistical calculations so closely, but the reasoning behind this view is far from clear.[26] Botting already regarded the case of the peppered moth as tantamount to belief in Lamarckian evolution, and was of the opinion that some genetic mechanism other than bird predation was at work.[27][28]/nFord never married, had no children, and was considered decidedly eccentric, although his eccentricity was said to be more prominent when he knew he had an audience; he was also fond of slightly surrealist practical joking.[29] He could be markedly generous to his friends: it was \"an open secret\" that he made a handsome contribution to the grant of \u00a3350000 given by the Nuffield Foundation for the establishment of a Unit of Medical Genetics at the University of Liverpool; this greatly boosted the research of Cyril Clarke and Philip Sheppard.[30]/nProfessor Ford would come into first year biology lectures at Oxford University \u2013 which were quite large, with about 150 students, and address the mixed group \u201cgood morning gentlemen\u201d, ignoring the ladies, who even at that time were maybe 30% of student numbers \u2013 they are now 48%.  The students thought that was amusing, and decided that, for one lecture in 1965, no men would attend.  So he walked in to the lecture theatre with about 50 women sitting there waiting attentively, but no men.  He put his notes on the lectern and looked up.  \u201cOh dear, nobody here today I see, might as well go home\u201d! Picked up his notes and walked out. (This story is also told of Arthur Quiller Couch, and has to be treated as apocryphal)(It is not apocryphal - it is confirmed by a number of first year Agriculture undergraduates who participated in the activity)./nNon-academic information on his life is hard to come by, mostly consisting of scattered remarks made by colleagues. He campaigned strenuously against the admission of female Fellows to All Souls College. Miriam Rothschild, an outstanding zoologist, was one of the few women with whom Ford was on good terms. Rothschild and Ford campaigned for the legalisation of male homosexuality in Britain. Ford was on good terms with Theodosius Dobzhansky, who did ground-breaking work on ecological genetics with Drosophila species: they exchanged letters and visits./nFord has a  memoir written by Bryan Clarke published in the Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society,[1] but there are few other sources on his life.[31]", "38311858": "Eviatar Nevo (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea\u05e8 \u05e0\u05d1\u05d5; born February 2, 1929, in Haifa, Mandatory Palestine),[1] is Professor Emeritus, founder and director of the Institute of Evolution at University of Haifa, Israel.[2]/nNevo received a M.Sc and  PhD (1964) from Hebrew University.

Glenn Center for Biology of Aging Research.[4] He is the president of the non-profit Academy for Health & Lifespan Research and an officer of the Order of Australia (AO)./nDavid Andrew Sinclair was born in Australia in 1969 and grew up in St Ives, New South Wales. His paternal grandmother had emigrated to Australia following the suppression of the Hungarian Uprising of 1956, and his father changed the family name from Szigeti to Sinclair.[3] Sinclair studied at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, obtaining a BSc in biochemistry with honours in 1991 and a Ph.D. in molecular genetics in 1995, focusing on gene regulation in yeast. He also won the Australian Commonwealth Prize.[1][3][5]/nIn 1993, he met Leonard P. Guarente, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who studied genes involved in the regulation of aging, when Guarente was on a lecture tour in Australia, and the meeting spurred Sinclair to apply for a post-doc position in Guarente's lab.[3] Earlier that year Cynthia Kenyon's lab at UCSF had discovered that a single-gene mutation in (Daf-2) could double the lifespan of C. elegans.[3]/nIn 1999, after four years of working as a postdoctoral researcher for Guarente, Sinclair was hired at Harvard Medical School.[3] In 2003, his lab was small and struggling for funding.[3] In 2004, Sinclair met with the philanthropist Paul F. Glenn who donated $5 million to Harvard to establish the Paul F. Glenn Laboratories for the Biological Mechanisms of Aging at Harvard, of which Sinclair became the founding director. He currently serves as the co-director with Bruce Yankner.[3]/nIn 2004, Sinclair, along with serial entrepreneur Andrew Perlman, Christoph Westphal, Richard Aldrich, Richard Pops, and Paul Schimmel, founded Sirtris Pharmaceuticals.[6][7] Sirtris was focused on developing Sinclair's research into activators of sirtuins, work that began in the Guarente lab.[6] The company was specifically focused on resveratrol formulations and derivatives as activators of the SIRT1 enzyme; Sinclair became known for making statements about resveratrol like: \"(It's) as close to a miraculous molecule as you can find.\u00a0... One hundred years from now, people may be taking these molecules on a daily basis to prevent heart disease, stroke, and cancer.\"[6] Most of the anti-aging field was more cautious, especially with regard to what else resveratrol might do in the body and its lack of bioavailability.[6][8] The company's initial product was called SRT501, and was a formulation of resveratrol.[9] Sirtris went public in 2007 and was subsequently purchased and made a subsidiary of GlaxoSmithKline in 2008 for $720 million. Five years later, GSK shuttered the Sirtris program without successful drug development.[10][11]/nIn 2006, Genocea Biosciences was founded based on work of Harvard scientist Darren E. Higgins around antigens that stimulate T cells and the use of these antigens to create vaccines;[12] Sinclair was a co-founder.[13] Genocea laid off most of its workforce in 2022 after presenting disappointing data at AACR[14]/nIn 2008, Sinclair was promoted to tenured professor at Harvard Medical School.[15] A few years later, he also became a conjoint professor at the School of Medical Sciences at the University of New South Wales.[15]/nIn 2008, Sinclair joined the scientific advisory board of Shaklee and helped them devise and introduce a product containing resveratrol called \"Vivix\"; after the Wall Street Journal requested an interview about his work with the company and its marketing, he disputed the use of his name and words to promote the supplement, and resigned.[16]/nIn 2011, Sinclair was a co-founder of OvaScience with Michelle Dipp (who had been involved with Sirtris), Aldrich, Westphal, and Jonathan Tilly, based on scientific work done by Tilly concerning mammalian oogonial stem cells and work on mitochondria by Sinclair.[17][18] Tilly's work was controversial, with some groups unable to replicate it.[19][20] The company ultimately came under pressure for skirting US regulatory authorities for fertility testing.[21]/nIn 2011, Sinclair was also a co-founder of CohBar, along with Nir Barzilai and other colleagues. CohBar aimed to discover and develop novel peptides derived from mitochondria.[22] Cohbar describes itself as a clinical stage biotechnology company but has no drug candidates in clinical testing./nIn 2015, Sinclair described to The Scientist his efforts to get funding for his lab, how his lab grew to around 20 people, shrank back down to about 5, and then grew again as he brought in funding from philanthropic organizations and companies, including companies that he helped to start.[22] In 2015, his lab had 22 people and was supported by one R01 grant and was 75% funded by non-federal funds.[22] However, as of 2016, this was no longer true as his federal funding began to increase.[23]/nIn September 2019, Sinclair published Lifespan: Why We Age \u2013 and Why We Don't Have To, a New York Times bestseller, co-written with journalist Matthew LaPlante and translated into 18 languages.[24] This was also released as an audiobook on Audible and read by Sinclair.[25] Sinclair broadly discusses his longevity practices on social media and includes them in his book. They include daily doses of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and resveratrol, which Sinclair says are activators of SIRT1.[26] In November 2022, Sinclair's company Metro Biotech successfully urged the FDA to take actions to take NMN off the market as a supplement because Metro Biotech had registered NMN and publicized NMN as an investigational new drug.[27]/nIn 2023 Sinclair co-founded Tally Health, a longevity company with a stated goal is to \"change the way we age\" at a cellular level.[28] Sinclair claims that improving his nutrition and exercise routine has shaved almost a decade off his biological age.[29] In June 2023, Sinclair was elected president of the non-profit Academy for Health & Lifespan Research.[30]/nSinclair has expressed the view that there is no limit to human lifespan, and that there is a backup copy of the genetic and epigenetic information in us.[31]/nWhile Sinclair was in Guarente's lab, he discovered that sirtuin 1 (called sir2 in yeast) slows aging in yeast by reducing the accumulation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles. Others working in the lab at the time identified NAD as an essential cofactor for sirtuin function.[3] In 2002, after he had left for Harvard, he clashed with Guarente at a scientific meeting at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, challenging Guarante's description of how sir2 might be involved in aging; this set off a scientific rivalry.[6]/nIn 2003, when his lab was still small, Sinclair learned that scientists at a Pennsylvania biotech company called Biomol Research Laboratories discovered that polyphenols including resveratrol could activate sir2, and he collaborated with them to confirm this.[3] This led to publications authored in part by Sinclair in both Nature and Science in 2003.[6] Sinclair's outspoken advocacy for resveratrol as an anti-aging compound started a scientific controversy over whether this was true, and whether resveratrol even activated sirtuins.[3][6][32] High-profile papers claiming age reversal of mice have also come under intense scrutiny.[33] Work in another lab, done partially with funding from Sirtris, found increases in the number of mitochondria in the cells of mice given high doses of resveratrol.[3] Sinclair's lab continued to work on resveratrol and analogues of it, as well as on mitochondria and NAD, all directed to understanding aging and how to prevent it.[32]/nIn December, 2020, Sinclair's group published that three Yamanaka transcription factors, Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4, when delivered together in a virus, could safely reverse the age of human and mouse cells, and restore the vision of old mice and mice with glaucoma.[34] In 2023, with Bruce Ksander's lab at Mass Eye and Ear, they reported at the annual ARVO conference that vision could be restored in non-human primates with their therapy.[1]/nIn January 2023, Sinclair's lab published research in Cell purporting support for his Information Theory of Aging, the idea that mammalian aging is due to the loss of epigenetic information and that Yamanaka factors could exert a degree of artificial control over senescence and rejuvenation in mice.[35] Sinclair's claims of reverse aging are controversial and received criticism from other scientists including Charles Brenner[36] and Peter Attia.[37]", "55973815": "Madhavan Radhakrishna Pillai (born 18 August 1960) is an Indian cancer biologist and the former director of the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology.

Females didn't attempt to mate again after their first copulation with the sterile male, suggesting that the release of sterile males into the wild (as organisations such as Oxitec are currently doing) could have a major effect on mosquito populations.[8][9][10][11] After briefly moving to the University of Perugia, Catteruccia joined the faculty of Harvard as a professor in 2011 upon an invitation by Dyann Wirth.[2][5] Two years later, Catteruccia and colleagues investigated the role of a male hormone in stimulating female production of eggs; an unusual direct link between copulation and ovulation as opposed to the other way round.[12][13] Catteruccia is also involved in the design of gene drives to force malaria-resistance genes to spread through mosquito populations, using CRISPR gene editing.[14][15][16]/nIn 2016 Catteruccia was awarded a faculty scholarship by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Simons Foundation worth $1.2 million to continue her malaria research.[17]/nIn 2019 Catteruccia published research in Nature demonstrating that exposure of mosquitoes to antimalarial medication lead to a reduction in their parasite load.[18][19] The study was notable because surprisingly low quantities of the drug atovaquone were needed to induce refractoriness of the mosquitoes towards parasite infection, and the compound could be absorbed through the legs of the insect (as if it was landing briefly on a bed net).[20][21] This could potentially be used to design more effective bed nets, which are currently becoming less effective due to the spread of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes.[20][21][22][23][24][25] Although mosquitoes are unlikely to develop resistance, given that their survival rates appear to be unaffected by the drug in lab conditions, malaria may still develop resistance especially if the drug is implemented on a mass scale.[20][23]/n2021 - Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator[26]/n2016 - Faculty Scholar award - Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation[27][28]/n2012 - PopTech Science Fellow[29]/n2006 - MRC Career Development Award[4]", "29202371": "Wac\u0142aw Gajewski (Polish pronunciation: [vat\u0361s.waf \u0261a\u02c8j\u025bf.ski]; 28 Februari 1911 \u2013 12 December 1997) was a Polish geneticist, one of the founders of the Polish post-war genetics and author of academic and popular scientific books./nGajewski was born in Krak\u00f3w in 1911.

This was done using a luciferase reporter gene expressed under the Per1.[7] In 2000, using their rodent model, they discovered the existence of circadian clocks in peripheral organs of mammals.[7] This discovery led to the current understanding of mammalian circadian control as a multi-oscillatory system.[8] He was also part of a team that discovered feeding cycles can entrain liver independently of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the light cycle.[9]/nIn 2005, Tei, G. Lundkvist, Y. Kwak, E. Davis, and G. Block proposed that the molecular clock was linked to neurons' membrane potential via voltage-dependent regulation of Ca2+ influx, as well as secondary action of intracellular Ca2+ on gene transcription.[10] Additionally, the same study found that removal of Ca2+ from the medium, as well as blocking the Ca2+ channels, stopped the SCN's circadian clock, while hyperpolarization of a K+ medium led to altered rhythms in the SCN.[10]/nIn 2016, a research team that included Tei discovered that clock genes, most specifically Bmal1 and Per1, are rhythmically expressed in osteoblasts to modulate the osteoblast-dependent regulation of osteoclastogenesis by regulating 1,25(OH)2D3-induced Rankl expression in osteoblasts.[11] Specifically for Bmal1, they found that Bmal1-deficient osteoblasts promote osteoclastogenesis.[12] These findings could lead to future studies of RAR patterns and bone turnover markers.[12]/nTei holds a patent on a Per1 promoter sequence that, when operably linked to another gene, will rhythmically promote its transcription. This promoter sequence allows for the creation of transgenic animals that will be useful in studying circadian disorders and diseases. Additionally, pharmaceutical treatments for such diseases can be tested on transgenic animals with this specific promoter.[13]/nFrom early in his professional career to his work current projects, Tei has worked with many other chronobiologists.

She moved to the United States for her post-graduate work. In Arnold Stein\u00a0[Wikidata]'s laboratory at Purdue University, she used classical chromatin biochemistry tools to understand how DNA sequence motifs and linker histones can shape the chromatin structure in silico, in vitro, and in vivo. During this time, she discovered that the regions of the mouse genome contained alternating tracts of stiff and flexible DNA, which allowed in silico prediction of nucleosome positions. These positions could be recapitulated in vitro using just purified histones and DNA, and detected in vivo, at developmentally regulated genes in mice. She also studied how linker histone H1 could influence nucleosome positioning and chromatin folding in vitro and in vivo. For these studies, she received her Ph.D. from Purdue University in 2003./nHistone variants were the next logical step in teasing out how intrinsic variability in the chromatin fiber can encode a diversity of biological functions.[1] To study this aspect of chromatin structure, Dalal moved to Seattle to work with Steven Henikoff at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center as a postdoctoral research associate from 2003\u20132007.[2] Using a range of biochemical analyses, she and colleagues uncovered that the Drosophila centromere-specific histone variant makes non-canonical nucleosomes, features of which are reminiscent of the ancestral nucleosomes seen in the archaebacteria.[1]/nDalal joined National Institutes of Health in September 2008.[2] She is a senior investigator in the laboratory of receptor biology and gene expression at the National Cancer Institute. She is director of the chromatin structure and epigenetic mechanisms group. She was awarded tenure at NIH in 2018.[1]/nDalal's lab has shown that some of these unusual features are conserved in human cells, that centromeric nucleosomes oscillate in structure and in modifications over the cell cycle. Such oscillations are perturbed in human cancers wherein CENP-A is innately mis-regulated and occupies ectopic regions of the human genome linked to instability. Her lab has also worked on dissecting the function of transcription of repetitive loci within human centromeres.

Schwartz was an active feminist advocate for women in science throughout her career; she was a founding member of the Association for Women in Science organization in 1971 and shared the founding presidency with Judith Pool. She also co-founded the Women in Endocrinology group under the auspices of the Endocrine Society, served terms as the president of the Endocrine Society and the Society for the Study of Reproduction, and was recognized for her exceptional mentorship of women scientists. In 2010, she published a memoir of her life in science, A Lab of My Own, in which she came out as lesbian.[1]/nSchwartz was born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1926.[2] to a family of Russian descent[3] who she has described as politically active.[4] She received her bachelor's degree from Goucher College (a women's college at the time) in 1948.[3][5] Despite originally being interested in English and journalism, she became interested in physiology during her undergraduate studies and spent summers conducting undergraduate research with Curt Richter at Johns Hopkins University, and separately at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine.[3]/nAfter graduation, Schwartz began her graduate studies at Northwestern University, where she received her Ph.D. in physiology in 1953 under the supervision of Allen Lein.[3][5] She was the only female Ph.D. student in the department at the time.[4]/nIn 1954 Schwartz was hired as a physiology instructor at the University of Illinois College of Medicine, which she left a year later to take a position at Michael Reese Hospital.

A hypothetical additional hormone given the name inhibin had been suggested years prior based on work with male animals, potentially being secreted from the testes. Schwartz's key insight was to instead investigate secretion from the ovaries in female subjects. The existence of inhibin in ovarian follicular fluid was confirmed by the Schwartz group in collaboration with Cornelia Channing in the mid-1970s.[3][10] Inhibin \u2013 which plays a role in both male and female hormonal signaling \u2013 was molecularly characterized in the mid-1980s as a protein dimer.

She has contributed heavily to efforts to obtain an effective HIV vaccine.[1]  She created a database at Los Alamos National Laboratory that has enabled her to design novel mosaic HIV vaccines, one of which is currently in human testing in Africa.[2]  The database contains thousands of HIV genome sequences and related data.[2]/nKorber is a scientist in theoretical biology and biophysics[1] at Los Alamos National Laboratory. She has received the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award, the Department of Energy's highest award for scientific achievement.[3] She has also received several other awards including the Elizabeth Glaser Award for pediatric AIDS research[4] and the Richard Feynman Award for Innovation.[5]/nBette Korber grew up in Southern California. She earned her B.S. in chemistry in 1981 from California State University, Long Beach, where her father was a sociology professor, her mother graduated in nursing, and her sister graduated in journalism.[4]  From 1981 to 1988, she was in the graduate program at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where she worked with Iwona Stroynowski in Leroy Hood's laboratory,[4] receiving her PhD in chemistry in 1988.[4] Her work focused on regulation of the expression of major histocompatibility complex type 1 genes, producing cell surface proteins that participate in the rejection of tissue transplants, by interferon induced by viral infections.[6][7]/nShe then became a postdoctoral fellow with Myron Essex, working on the molecular epidemiology of the AIDS/HIV virus and HTLV-1, the human leukemia virus, at the Harvard School of Public Health until 1990.[8] There, Korber used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to show both complete and deleted versions of viral genomes in leukemic cells.[9] Her work on these viral partial and complete genomes was influential and widely cited.[10][11][12] She became a visiting faculty member at the Santa Fe Institute in 1991, continuing in that position until 2011.[4]/nKorber conducts her research at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where she began in 1990.[4]  Her approach involves applying computational biology to the design of a vaccine against the HIV/AIDS virus.[13]  She first became interested in HIV when a close friend of hers and her fianc\u00e9's at Caltech contracted one of the first cases of AIDS in Pasadena, California.[2]  She said, \"We learned a lot about HIV while he was sick. But there was no treatment for him and he died in 1991. I decided when I graduated from my PhD program that I wanted to work on HIV.\"[13] Several years later, looking back on this event, she described its effects: \"I hate HIV ... I lost a couple friends to it. HIV kills in horrible ways. I think of what the epidemic has done to Africa and it motivates me.\"[13]/nKorber oversees the HIV Database and Analysis Project at Los Alamos.[13] She and her team have built a global HIV database of more than 840,000 sequences from publications of the viral genome.[5]  In addition, the database focuses on the small regions (called epitopes) within the virus that can be recognized by antibodies, and evaluates the evidence for the strength of each epitope in eliciting immune responses. There is also data on the immunological profiles of individuals resistant to HIV.[13] Korber and many other researchers have applied the data to devise possible treatments and vaccines against HIV.[5] Her work has resulted in design of vaccines now being tested in clinical trials.[4][5]/nCreating a vaccine against HIV has been challenging because the virus mutates rapidly, creating multiple variants that may not be recognized by immune system components specific to the original infecting virus.[2]  The most variable region is the surface of the virus, but there is also some variation of the internal proteins involved in virus replication, which may be attacked by the cellular immunity system or T cell responses.[14] A recent approach that Korber and collaborators have taken is to design mosaic antigens.[2] Korber developed a novel mosaic HIV vaccine that may slow or prevent HIV infection; this is currently in human testing in Africa.[2] The goal of the mosaic antigen vaccine is to protect the vaccinated person against the great variety of HIV variants encountered.[2]/nSince the proteins of HIV vary so greatly, mosaic test proteins are designed to represent the most common forms of HIV-1 virus that can be recognized by antibodies or cellular immune responses (epitopes).[15] In 2009, Korber described the process: \"I create sort of little Frankenstein proteins that look and feel like HIV proteins but they don't exist in nature.\"[16]/nSeveral of the major variations are included in each molecule of protein, thus producing a variant protein antigen that probably does not exist in the wild virus population but should cross-react with variants that do exist.[15]  Korber has taken two different approaches to designing such antigens.  Her group has developed a computer algorithm to choose epitopes to combine into a mosaic molecule for the mosaic antigens.[17] In 2009, she described a designed mosaic protein this way: \"People didn't know if it would fold properly, if it would be antigenic, or if it would have the same sites that recognized by killer T cells\". They found that the newly designed antigens did fold properly and acted as a strong antigen, and were recognized by the cytotoxic T cells (killer cells).[16] Also, Korber and her collaborators have developed a graphical analysis called Epigraph that can generate promising antigens with a mixture of epitopes.[17] Korber explains that the approach of designing a protein via computer, combining bits of known proteins that provoke immune responses, had never been tried.  She says, \"Even after it worked, it was hard to convince people that this novel thing could be a vaccine because it hadn't been done before\".[2]/nIn collaboration with Dan Barouch, a professor at Harvard Medical School, some of these antigens have been tested in monkeys as possible vaccines.  With one series of tests, Barouch checked a number of possible ways to deliver the virus genes and chose to use the common cold virus as a vehicle.[2] The tested mosaic vaccine routinely slowed monkey infection with the closely related Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), and for 66 percent of monkeys exposed multiple times, no infection resulted.[2]  Next, in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies (a division of Johnson & Johnson), and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the researchers tested a mosaic vaccine for safety in human subjects; it passed that test too.[2] In 2017, the group of collaborators announced a human efficiency test with that same mosaic protein preparation, vaccinating 2,600 women in Sub Saharan Africa, who will be examined for several years to show how efficiently, if at all, the virus interferes with infection.[2] Korber cautioned that effectiveness of this strategy in monkeys is not a guarantee that a human vaccine will work.[2]/nIn recognition of her research, Korber received the 2018 Feynman Award for Innovation, the first woman at Los Alamos National Laboratory to receive one.[18] She recalled that at Caltech when few women were there, she took a class with physicist Richard Feynman and became friends with him. She said, \"At a time when kindness seemed rare, I really appreciated his generous spirit and encouragement. I think he would have been pleased about this award\".[5]/nIn the history of HIV/AIDS virus with regard to when and where HIV originated, Edward Hooper had postulated in a best-selling book called The River: A Journey to the Source of HIV and AIDS in 1999[19] that HIV could have jumped from chimpanzees to humans because of an accidental contamination by chimpanzee SIV of the oral polio vaccine (CHAT) used in Africa in the 1950s.[20] Korber and her colleagues employed the Los Alamos National Laboratory database's genomic data to calculate when the HIV sequence evolution began, using a model of evolution based on the mutation rate of HIV strains and assuming that variable was the same on all branches of the evolutionary tree. In 2000 they published an estimate of approximately 1930 for the origin of the human immunodeficiency virus.[21] Their research was covered widely as establishing a new date for the origin of the human virus, discrediting the oral polio virus theory, and therefore refuting concerns about using oral polio vaccine (OPV).[22][23][24][25][26] These two concepts of the origin of this virus plus other related theories continued to compete for scientific credibility.[20][21][27]/nIn 2008, Worobey and collaborators used a computer modeling approach similar to Korber's but with a relaxed evolutionary model and two older samples, collected earlier than any genomes included in Korber's study, and found an origin date for HIV of approximately 1900.[28]/nAs the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, Korber and her Los Alamos colleagues devised computational strategies that look for evolutionary changes in genes that encode the Spike proteins that stud the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and give it its crown-like appearance.[29] Her strategies can examine millions of global genomes stored by GISAID, and it flags mutations that vary from the original Wuhan sequence by at least a minimum specified threshold amount.[30] Using this strategy, she and colleagues identified a particular Spike mutation, Aspartic acid (Asp) to Glycine (Gly) at position 614 (D614G), that was gaining prevalence across the globe since February 2020.[31] This finding, which was controversial at first,[32] was validated by multiple other groups who showed that the D614G mutation was shown to improve the efficiency of replication and transmission of SARS-CoV-2,[33] and this mutation, as of June 2020, has become part of all globally prevalent SARS-CoV-2 strains. As of September 28, 2021, she and her group continue to analyze GISAID data for novel variants,[34][29] and she continues to be an active member of the NIH TRACE Working Group,[35] whose objective is to \"provide actionable intelligence on SARS-CoV-2 variants through genomic surveillance, data sharing and curation, and standardized in vitro assessments of therapeutics against novel strains.\"/nKorber married James Theiler in 1988.[13]  They have two sons.[13]/nOut of her concern for the impact of AIDS on those with few financial resources, Korber contributed $50,000 from her EO Lawrence Award to help establish, along with family and friends, an AIDS orphanage in South Africa, working through Nurturing Orphans of AIDS for Humanity (NOAH).[13] She has joined the Board of NOAH.[36] She also contributed to the distribution of Earth Boxes of maintenance-free portable gardens to orphanages, clinics, and schools in Africa.[13]/nIn 2019, Korber led a series of lectures called Frontiers in Science that focused on her work designing a vaccine against HIV.[42]", "2988039": "Huntington Faxon Willard (born c.1953) is an American geneticist.

His Ph.D. thesis was the first ever written in Hebrew (\u201cStudies of the Microflora of the Dead Sea\u201d)./nHis discovery of microorganisms in the Dead Sea was the focal point of his work from 1936 to 1945 and was the theme of his doctoral thesis. From 1939 to 1958 Volcani served on the staff of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, and in 1948 he was appointed head of the Institute's Section of Microbiology. During the 1940s, he also spent time in the United States as a research fellow at the University of California, Berkeley; Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University; the California Institute of Technology; and the University of Wisconsin./nIn March 1948, Volcani married Eleanor Susan Brownell Anthony \"Toni\" Solomons Jackson, the daughter of Theodore Solomons, in New York City.[1][5][6][7][8][nb 1][nb 2] After their marriage, the couple settled in Israel. Volcani smuggled in a small field-radar unit in his baggage. His wife remembers walking to the market in Rehovot, about one mile (1.6\u00a0km) from their house, and diving into foxholes along the road when pairs of small two-seater Arab planes came over on bombing runs. They came in low, each dropping its 25\u00a0lb (11\u00a0kg) bomb as it flew off. The first bomb of the war fell on the street in front of the Volcani\u2019s house. Volcani and his wife had one child, Yanon Volcani,[1] born in Israel in January 1949. Yanon is a clinical psychologist practicing in San Diego, California./nVolcani died on February 6, 1999, in La Jolla, California.[1][9]/nIn 1939, Volcani became a member of the Sieff Institute in Rehovot, later renamed the Weizmann Institute of Science. He headed its laboratory of microbiology until 1959, when he joined the faculty at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. He decided to focus on diatoms, one of the very few organisms that use silicon rather than calcium for their skeletal structures. Silicon is one of the most abundant elements on earth, and in 1959 no one was working on its metabolism. The biology of silicon had been shunned by all biochemists, the dogma being that it was inert. Volcani realized that diatoms, whose life cycle is based on silicon, provided an ideal experimental canvas. From 1959 onward, his lab made multifaceted discoveries centered on biologically active silicon in marine diatoms. The lab became a focal point for the study of silicon metabolism and biomineralization at the molecular level, embracing experimental techniques, from elegant electron microscopy of diatom shells to gene cloning and the expression of silicon transporting proteins in frog eggs./nHe invented ways to synchronize the cell division cycle of diatoms. He showed that silicon activates the gene coding for the polymerase enzyme that copies diatom DNA. He was also interested in the toxic and pathological effects of polysilicates, such as talc and asbestos, on mammalian cells in tissue culture, and was the first to do tissue culture at Scripps. He spent a one-year sabbatical at the University of Swansea studying the effects of polysilicates on mammalian cells, and published papers on the uptake of silicic acid by rat liver mitochondria./nHis studies of silicon metabolism often involved growing diatoms of various species in different concentrations of silicon and then studying the effect on specific metabolic pathways. These experiments studied pigments, lipids, amino acids, cell wall synthesis, DNA synthesis, ribosomes, sodium-potassium membrane pumps, cell membrane characterization, glycolate metabolism, cyclic nucleotide metabolism, protein kinases, and a catalog of genes that were turned on by silicon. Several papers centered on the effects of silicon on photorespiration in diatoms./nHe published over 100 papers related to silicon metabolism and co-edited Silicon and Siliceous Structures in Biological Systems (Springer, 1981). He received  continuing grants from the National Institutes of Health for 32 years. He trained many doctoral students and had a constant stream of postdoctoral associates and visitors passing through the lab until his retirement in 1985.", "70260812": "Teresa Camacho Badani (Cochabamba, 22 February 1984) is a Bolivian biologist who is the chief of herpetology at the Museo de Historia Natural Alcide d\u2019Orbigny in Cochabamba.

He eventually obtained a Doctorate in Natural Sciences, specializing in Genetics, in 1976, from the Pierre and Marie Curie University.[4]/nHe was a trainee, then attach\u00e9, charg\u00e9 and research master at the CNRS from 1970 to 1983, then a Professor at the Pierre and Marie Curie University from 1983 to 2015, at the same time part-time assistant professor at the Ecole Polytechnique (1984-1988). From 1989 to 1992 he was Head of Laboratory at the Institut Pasteur, then Professor from 1993 to 2015.[5] He was the head of the Unit\u00e9 de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique Mol\u00e9culaire des Levures from 1989 to his retirement in 2015./nAmong the other functions occupied during his career, he has been appointed scientific deputy director general of the Institut Pasteur from 2006 to 2008, by the director general, Alice Dautry, and from 1997 to 2011 he was a senior member of the Institut Universitaire de France.[6] He is Emeritus Professor at the Institut Pasteur./nBernard Dujon scientific work focuses on the genetic material of eukaryotic organisms, its organization, dynamics, functioning and evolution.  Most of his work has used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as experimental material, but he also got interested in studying other yeasts of biotechnological or medical interest, such as Kluyveromyces lactis and Candida glabrata./nIn Gif-sur-Yvette, Bernard Dujon started to study a strange genetic phenomenon, linked to mitochondrial genetics, whose study was still in infancy.[7] When crossing two haploid yeast species carrying different mitochondrial mutations, conferring the resistance to erythromycin or to chloramphenicol, allele segregation did not follow mendelian rules and recombinants appeared in mysterious proportions. At that time, no one had any idea of the genetic content of mitochondria, except that it contained DNA. Bernard Dujon was studying a particular mitochondrial locus, called omega, that could be present as two different alleles, omega+ or omega-. Genetic crosses between yeast cells carrying different alleles led to highly distorted inheritance in the progeny, since almost all cells ended up carrying the omega+ allele! In 1974, he proposed a model in which gene conversion of the omega- allele to omega+ was achieved by homologous recombination, replacing one allele by the other, copying in the process the flanking erythromycin and chloramphenicol mutations./nAt about the same time, recombinant DNA technologies and restriction enzymes were discovered. In 1977, independent researches by Fred Sanger on one side and by Walter Gilbert and Allan Maxam on the other, led to the invention of two different methods to sequence DNA. Later the same year, introns were discovered. Thermal denaturation studies with Fran\u00e7ois Michel, another student of Piotr Slonimski, suggested that omega could be an intron. Bernard Dujon contacted Walter Gilbert at Harvard University about the possibility to come to his lab for a short post-doctoral period, in order to sequence the omega locus. He moved to Harvard the following year and in 1979 achieved the sequence of what would become the first mobile intron to be described.[8] But the most surprising result was not that omega was indeed an intron, but that it contained an open reading frame, putatively encoding a 235 amino acid protein with no homology to any known protein. At that time, no intron was supposed to be coding. Could it be that the encoded protein played a role in the intron mobility between omega- and omega+ strains\u00a0?[9]/nBack to Gif-sur-Yvette in 1981, Bernard Dujon set up a small team in an old lab space lent by Piotr Slonimski. Fran\u00e7ois Michel rapidly joined him and later on Alain Jacquier, Hugues Blanc, Pierre Dehoux and Laurence Colleaux, as well as sabbatical visitors such as Walt Fangman from the University of Washington. They discovered that the omega intron was present in other yeast species collected in Harvard. Following the sequencing of several other introns, Fran\u00e7ois Michel discovered that these introns could be folded into stem-loops whose structures (if not their sequences) were conserved. This suggested that they could be directly involved in the splicing mechanism by defining exon-intron junctions. In addition, they discovered that two different intronic structures existed, defining what they called group I[10] and group II introns, a nomenclature still in use today. They published their models of intron folding in Biochimie in 1982 and this article quickly became a reference for researchers in the field.[11]/nBut the precise function of the omega-encoded protein was still unknown. Bernard Dujon decided to adapt the mitochondrial gene to the universal genetic code in order to be able to express it in a heterologous system. At that time, it was a real tour de force, since oligonucleotide synthesis and in vitro mutagenesis were uncommon and not available in Gif-sur-Yvette. Fortunately, Bernard Dujon met Francis Galibert, who was working at the H\u00f4pital Saint Louis in Paris and who just came back from Fred Sanger laboratory to set up his own lab. At that time, he was the only one in France to be able to synthesize oligonucleotides. With the help of Francis Galibert's oligonucleotides, Bernard Dujon modified 26 of the 235 codons of the omega reading frame to adapt it to the universal genetic code. Synthesis of the resulting protein in Escherichia coli, in the presence of a plasmid carrying the omega-sequence showed without any ambiguity, in 1985, that the omega protein was a double-strand DNA endonuclease, as was predicted by the model 12 years ago.[12] This nuclease took afterwards the conventional name of I-SceI,[13] the first intron homing endonuclease discovered, first of its kind but dozens of others would rapidly follow./nIn 1987, a call for a yeast geneticist was published by the Institut Pasteur. Bernard Dujon applied and left Gif-sur-Yvette to move to Paris. In this new scientific environment, he used I-SceI to the purpose of making unique double-strand breaks in complex genomes, such as mouse,[14] plants or the human genome, in collaboration with many scientists worldwide. In collaboration with the laboratory of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Nicolas at the Institut Pasteur, Arnaud Perrin and Andr\u00e9 Choulika (who would later become two founding members of the biotech company Cellectis) were able to do the first gene replacement in mouse cells using I-SceI,[15] at the same time Maria Jasin in United States was doing similar experiments in human cells.[16]/nIn 1988, Andr\u00e9 Goffeau, a Belgian yeast geneticist from the University of Louvain-la-Neuve convinced the European Commission to support the complete sequencing of the yeast genome.[17] Under his management, 30 European laboratories collaborated to this endeavor. Their goal was to sequence 10 kb of DNA in two years of time, in order to complete chromosome III sequence, one of the smallest ones.[18] Later on, they were joined by other labs worldwide to help sequencing the 15 other chromosomes. Bernard Dujon took an active part in this project and was one of the leading figures of the yeast program. He coordinated the sequencing of two chromosomes out of sixteen (XI and XV)[19][20] and the map of a third chromosome (VII) was made by Herv\u00e9 Tettelin, Andr\u00e9 Goffeau's student, using the I-SceI chromosome fragmentation technology developed in the meantime.[21] The yeast genome sequence was completed in 1995 and published one year later.[22] During the course of this project, it was discovered that one third of the sequenced genes had no homologue in any database (the so-called \"orphans\").[23] The extremely high level of gene redundancy, due -at least in part- to an ancient whole-genome duplication in the ancestor of Saccharomyces species, led to a new era in biology.[24] Genomics, freshly born as a new science, will be studying entire genomes, instead of individual genes, and try to understand genome organization and evolution./nWhile Bernard Dujon was participating to the EUROFAN program, aiming at determining the function of all discovered genes, he started a completely different approach, based on yeast comparative genomics. Odile Ozier-Kalogeropoulos and her Master student, Alain Malpertuy, had produced 600 sequence reads of a yeast of biotechnological interest, Kluyveromyces lactis. This allowed them to identify hundreds of new genes by direct comparison with the S. cerevisiae genome.[25] By analogy with Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) that were widely used at that time as a proxy to estimate the number of different human genes and their expression tissues, Alain Malpertuy coined these sequences Random Sequence Tags (RST) and the acronym was subsequently kept for further similar studies./nFollowing an informal discussion with Jean Weissenbach, head of the G\u00e9noscope, the largest sequencing center in France, Bernard Dujon contacted two French geneticists who were known to be interested in non-conventional yeast species: Jean-Luc Souciet at the University of Strasbourg and Claude Gaillardin at the National Center for Agronomy (INRA) in Grignon. Together, with several French laboratories sharing similar scientific interests, they decided to sequence to low coverage 13 yeast species representing the various branches of the Saccharomycotina (formerly known as Hemiascomycetes), some of them of biotechnological or medical interest. At the end of the year 1998, the G\u00e9noscope offered 50 000 sequence reads for this project, 40 millions of nucleotides, roughly corresponding to 0.2-0.4 X coverage of each of the 13 genomes. Altogether, 20 000 new genes were discovered and allowed to compare sequence divergence, synteny, gene redundancy and functions among these 13 species and between them and S. cerevisiae. These yeasts revealed at the level of their genomes, large evolutionary distances between them . Their comparison made possible to develop new theories on the molecular mechanisms of evolution of eukaryotic genomes which, thanks to the power of genetics in S. cerevisiae, can be directly subjected to experimentation. Results were published in a special issue of FEBS Letters, edited by Horst Feldman and appeared in press just a few days before the end of the 20th century.[26]/nFollowing this project, a landmark for subsequent yeast comparative genomics studies, the CNRS offered to support the French consortium, under the name G\u00e9nolevures (levure being the French word for yeast). Note that the financial support was limited to coordination, but did not cover sequencing nor subsequent data analysis. The G\u00e9nolevures consortium sequenced to completion four yeast genomes, Candida glabrata, Kluyveromyces lactis, Debaryomyces hansenii and Yarrowia lipolytica. Numerous functional and comparative studies were made from these sequences, including genes involved in replication, recombination and repair,[27] mating and meiosis,[28] short and long tandem repeats, tRNA genes, introns, pseudogenes, telomeres and subtelomeres and evolution of the genetic code. These results were published in Nature,[29] as well as in several other scientific journals.[30][31]/nSequencing yeast genomes led to the discovery of many new genes of unknown function, phylogenetically unrelated. This led to the question of their very origin. Bernard Dujon tried to tackle this problem by setting up an experimental system to study the evolution of tRNA genes. During the course of these experiments, he discovered that yeast strains in which an essential amino-acyl-tRNA synthetase had been replaced by its homologue from Yarrowia lipolytica, a distantly related yeast, were severely unfit. However, normal growth revertants appeared in the culture at a high frequency. Whole-genome sequencing of these mutants showed that the chromosomal segment containing the foreign tRNA synthetase had been amplified by a rolling circle mechanism, creating a variety of aberrant chromosomal structures under constant evolution. While looking for tRNA duplication, Bernard Dujon discovered the amplification of its cognate tRNA synthetase.[32]/nFascinated by interspecific hybridizations that spontaneously occurred frequently in nature, Bernard Dujon last scientific project was to create artificial yeast species resulting from forced hybridization between two known yeast species and to study genome evolution of these new hybrids. This was the PhD project of Lucia Morales, last of the many students trained by Bernard Dujon over the course of his long career. Making these hybrids at the bench proved to me much more challenging than initially expected, suggesting that laboratory conditions may not favor interspecific hybridizations between distant yeast species.[33]/nBernard Dujon retired in 2015, at the age of 68 and became Emeritus Professor. Over the 26 years during which the Unit\u00e9 de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique Mol\u00e9culaire des Levures was operating, more than 120 people have worked there, 250 scientific publications were produced shared with more than 800 colleagues all over the world and 22 PhD thesis and Habilitations \u00e0 diriger des recherches were defended. As Bernard Dujon put it at the end of his retirement talk, in March 2016: \"Scientific research was a successful globalization.\"/nMany of his former students or post-docs have continued in biological research or related fields, many of them obtaining positions in academic research and starting their own lab in France or abroad (alphabetically): Guillaume Chanfreau (UCLA), Laurence Colleaux (Institut Imagine), Alain Jacquier (Institut Pasteur), Romain Koszul (Institut Pasteur), Emmanuelle Fabre (H\u00f4pital Saint Louis), C\u00e9cile Fairhead (Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay), Gilles Fischer (Sorbonne Universit\u00e9), Bertrand Llorente (Universit\u00e9 Aix-Marseille), Fran\u00e7ois Michel (Gif-sur-Yvette), Anne Plessis (Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot), Emmanuel Talla (Universit\u00e9 Aix-Marseille), Herv\u00e9 Tettelin (University of Maryland) and Teresa Teixeira-Fernandes (Sorbonne Universit\u00e9)./nBernard Dujon is the author of a vulgarization book on genetics,[34] as well as of a textbook entitled Trajectoires de la g\u00e9n\u00e9tique.[35] He recently published a recollection of his scientific -and personal- life in FEMS Yeast Research.[36]/nHe is a member of Academia Europaea (since 2000), a member of the French Academy of sciences (since 2002), and a member of the U.S. National Academy of Inventors since 2017.

She was joint editor for many years of the International Journal of Radiation Biology and deputy director of Paterson Laboratories in Manchester. She made a \"fundamental contribution to cell biology\"[1] in collaboration with physicist Stephen Pelc when they \"were the first to ascribe a timeframe to cellular life,\" creating the concept of the cell cycle.[2] Their nomenclature for the stages of cell replication[3] is used universally and appears in every textbook of biology and pathology.[1]/nShe married twice after the start of her career but published, and was generally known in the scientific community, under her maiden name.[4]/nAlma Clavering Howard was born in Montr\u00e9al on 23 October 1913, the fourth and youngest child of barrister Eratus Edwin Howard and Evalyn Isobel Peverley. Her paternal aunt was the mother of Northrop Frye,[5] a cousin who would become one of the twentieth century's most influential literary critics and theorists. First educated at the Trafalgar School for Girls, she attended McGill University, graduating in 1934 with an Hons. B.Sc. in Botany and Zoology.[4] She then completed graduate studies at McGill in the Department of Genetics under Charles Leonard Huskins. Her Ph.D. thesis was The correlation between chromosome behaviour and susceptibility to mammary gland cancer in mice (1938), for which she won the Governor General's Academic Medal for graduate work in science.[4]/nIn 1939, Howard married Patrick William Rolleston and took up a Finney-Howell Research Fellowship at McGill. She was demonstrator in Genetics at McGill into 1940 and \"in the course of this work she discovered a new murine mutation.\"[4] In 1940, her first son, Francis, was born, followed by a second son, Patrick, in 1942. After World War II, she moved with her husband and children to England. However, her husband died in 1947 and her colleague Jack Boag would later note that she \"had to find work which would allow her freedom to bring up her two young sons.\"[4] At the same time, Louis Harold Gray was looking for a cytologist to work in his radiobiology team at the UK Medical Research Council's Radiotherapeutic Research Unit at Hammersmith Hospital. By \"fortunate chance he was introduced to Dr. Howard and flexible working arrangements were readily agreed.\"[4] On a preliminary visit to the Radiotherapeutic Research Unit, she met physicist Stephen Pelc who had developed a variant autoradiograph technique[1][6] and \"was much interested in his use of radioactive iodine for the autoradiography of rat thyroid slices.\"[4]/nBy 1949, her youngest son was old enough to start prep-school and Howard joined the staff at Hammersmith, becoming part of Gray's team of scientists dedicated to studying the biological effects of ionizing radiation and to developing the use of radioactive isotopes.[1] As a geneticist, Howard already recognized the importance of DNA,[1] and although the double helix structure would not be discovered for a few more years, \"the idea that chromosomes are made of DNA was generally agreed on.\"[7] On her first day, she suggested to Stephen Pelc that radioactive phosphorus taken into the cell might be incorporated into DNA and give some information on the replication and synthesis of this important substance.[1] They injected a mouse with phosphorus-32 to study the rate at which the isotope incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells in the testis and the resulting autoradiographs were promising.[4]  However, in animal cells and tissues the background radioactivity from remaining Phosphorus-32 made it impossible to obtain an autoradiograph localized down to individual chromosomes and parts of chromosomes.[1]/nThere were a limited number of radioactive isotopes available in the early 1950s, but Howard and Pelc switched to a botanical experimental system well established in Gray's lab, the bean root Vicia faba, and they were then able to continue their research with Phosphorus-32. In plant cells, unlike animal tissues, the radioactive phosphorus is incorporated into fewer complex compounds. By chance they discovered a simple acid digestion removed most of the Phosphorus-32 not synthesized into DNA.[7] Looking at the uptake of Phosphorus-32 into the nucleus of dividing cells in the meristem of the broad bean root demonstrated the then \"surprising conclusion that DNA replication occurs during a limited period in interphase, which they called \"S-phase\", the preceding \"gap\" was termed G1, the subsequent one G2.\"[3][8] Howard and Pelc published this finding in 1953, the same year Watson and Crick published Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid. While Howard and Pelc were sure of the significance of their findings, \"the relevance of cell-cycle studies in the bean root to either cancer or medicine was not immediately accepted.\"[1] However, by 1957 [3H]-thymidine and [14C]-adenine radioligands became available, enabling animal studies, and consequently the whole basis of cell kinetics was developed from their original concepts.[1]/nWhile at Hammersmith, Howard also worked with Michael Ebert. They discovered that \"excess pressures of the rare gases xenon, krypton and argon could suppress the oxygen enhancement effect on the radiation killing of Vicia faba cells.\"[4] In 1956 Howard left Hammersmith and joined the new radiobiology research unit Gray was setting up at Mount Vernon Hospital. In 1958 she married Michael Ebert.[4]/nIn 1960, she was appointed Secretary-General of the second International Radiation Research Congress, which was held in Harrogate in 1962. In 1963, both Howard and Ebert moved to Paterson Laboratories, where Howard was Head of the Radiobiology Group. They started, as joint editors, the journal Current Topics in Radiation Research. In 1966, Howard became deputy director at the Paterson Laboratories and also Joint Editor of International Journal of Radiation Biology, the later position held until her death.[4] She \"served the research community well by her rigorous standards of scientific accuracy and of literary style.\"[4] Additional appointments included Chairman of the Association of Radiation Research and of the British Association for Cancer Research, and as Secretary and later Chairman of the L.H. Gray Trust./nAlma Howard began to suffer from progressive lameness around 1969 and her condition was eventually diagnosed as Multiple sclerosis. She \"remained mobile\" and carried on both her scientific work and hosted visiting scientists, postgraduate students and family friends from many countries at her home with Ebert in Chinley, White Hall.[4] Both she and her husband Michael Ebert retired from active research in 1976. On 28 December 1982, while vacationing with his wife and family in Seefeld in Tirol, Michael Ebert died suddenly.[9] Howard returned to England. She died on 1 April 1984 from cancer of the liver after a short terminal illness.[1]/nA contemporary from her days at McGill remembered her as a \"strikingly handsome girl who took a lively part in the intense arguments that went on, but always managed to 'keep her cool' and to maintain an attitude of friendly respect combined with gracious dignity.\"[4] Later colleague Jack Boag stated in her obituary that these \"character traits remained with her throughout her life.\"[4]/nHoward was author or joint author of some 94 papers in the fields of genetics and radiobiology.[4] On 24\u201325 July 1985, a Symposium in memory of Alma Howard, entitled The cell cycle concept and its applications, was held in Manchester and the papers published in a special issue of the International Journal of Radiation Biology.[10]  Following her death, the annual Alma Howard Memorial Lecture was inaugurated at McGill./nThe fiftieth anniversary of Watson and Crick's publication of the double helix structure of DNA was in 2003 and their discovery was widely celebrated in the scientific community. However, some also noted that Howard and Pelc's discovery was \"in danger of slipping past unmarked\"[2] and that their \"paper, also published in 1953,\u00a0... set the scene for the model of the cell cycle as we know it today.\"[7] While their findings are \"now common place, the inventors are largely forgotten and rarely quoted.\"[8] Despite this, \"cell-cycle studies have flourished\u00a0... the concept was later developed and the checkpoints in cell-cycle regulation and universal control mechanisms were determined by using genetics and molecular biology.\"[2]/nShirley Hornsey explained the clinical impact in her 1984 obituary of Alma Howard: \"...\u00a0the whole basis of cell kinetics was developed from their original concepts.

De Beer returned to England in 1971 and died at Alfriston, Sussex on 21 June 1972.[citation needed]/nDe Beer's early work at Oxford was influenced by J. B. S. Haldane and by Julian Huxley and E. S. Goodrich (two of his teachers). His early work was in experimental embryology; some of it was done in collaboration with Huxley, who would go on to be one of the leading figures of the modern synthesis. The Elements of experimental embryology, written with Huxley, was the best summary of the field at that time (1934)./nIn Embryos and Ancestors (1930) de Beer stressed the importance of heterochrony,[9] and especially paedomorphosis in evolution. According to his theories, paedomorphosis (the retention of juvenile features in the adult form) is more important in evolution than gerontomorphosis, since juvenile tissues are relatively undifferentiated and capable of further evolution, whereas highly specialised tissues are less able to change. He also conceived the idea of clandestine evolution, which helped to explain the sudden changes in the fossil record which were apparently at odds with Darwin's gradualist theory of evolution. If a novelty were to evolve gradually in an animal's juvenile form, then its development would not appear in the fossil record at all, but if the species were then to undergo neoteny (a form of paedomorphosis in which sexual maturity is reached while in an otherwise juvenile form), then the feature would appear suddenly in the fossil record, despite having evolved gradually./nDe Beer worked on paleornithology and general evolutionary theory, and was largely responsible for elucidating the concept of mosaic evolution, as illustrated by his review of Archaeopteryx in 1954. De Beer's also reviewed Haeckel's concept of heterochrony, with particular emphasis on its role in avian evolution, especially that of the ratites, in 1956. Dedicated to the popularisation of science, he received the Kalinga Prize from UNESCO./nDe Beer was the first to propose the Col de la Traversette as the likely site where Hannibal had crossed the Alps with his elephants.[10] His thesis received support in 2016 when Mahaney et al. reported that sediments had been identified at the pass that had been churned up by \"the constant movement of thousands of animals and humans\" and dated them to the time of Hannibal's invasion.[10]/nThe conventional view had been that developmental biology had little influence on the modern synthesis, but the following assessment suggests otherwise, at least as far as de Beer is concerned:/nIn a series of remarkable books that established the synthetic theory of evolution, Gavin de Beer's Embryology and evolution was the first and the shortest (1930; expanded and retitled Embryos and ancestors, 1940; 3rd ed 1958).

He later transferred his laboratory to the University of Oxford to engage in more translational research.[9]/nWhile at the University of Virginia, Foster and Menaker performed experiments where the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) was tested by neural transplantation of donor's SCN to a recipient with an ablated SCN. In the experiment, the donor was a mutant strain of hamster with a shortened circadian period. The recipient was a wild-type hamster. Transplantation was done the other way around as well, with wild-type hamster as the donor and mutant strain hamster as the recipient. After the transplantation, the formerly wild-type hamster displayed a shortened period which resembled the mutant, and the mutant-strain hamster showed normal period. The SCN restored rhythm to arrhythmic recipients, which afterwards always exhibited the circadian period of the donor. This result led to the conclusion that the SCN is sufficient and necessary for mammalian circadian rhythms.[10]/nIn 1991, Foster and his colleagues provided evidence that rods and cones are not necessary for entrainment of an animal to light.[11] In this experiment, Foster gave light pulses to retinally degenerative mice. These mice were homozygous for the rd allele and were shown to have no rods in their retina. Only a few cones were found to remain in the retina. To study the effects of light entrainment, magnitude of phase shift of locomotor activity was measured. The results showed that both mice with normal retina and mice with degenerate retina showed similar entrainment patterns. Foster hypothesized that circadian photoreception occurs with a small number of cones without an outer layer or that an unrecognised class of photoreceptive cells are present./nIn 1999, Foster studied light entrainment on mice without cones or both rods and cones.[12] Mice without cones or without both photoreceptive cells (rd/rd cl allele) still entrained to light. Meanwhile, mice with eyes removed could not entrain to light. Foster concluded that rods and cones are unnecessary for entrainment to light, and that the murine eye contains additional photoreceptive cell types.

[1][3] In 1884, he obtained a BA in biology from the University of Oxford, with first-class honours.[4] Through his time at Oxford, Spencer attended lectures by anthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor, which began a lifelong interest in the field.[5]/nAs a graduate, Spencer worked as a teaching assistant to his former professor Henry Nottidge Moseley, where he aided in the transferral of General Pitt-Rivers's collection of anthropological artefacts from the South Kensington Museum to Oxford University, which had built a museum to house it.[1][3][5] He obtained a fellowship at Lincoln College, Oxford in 1886.[1]/nHaving already contributed various papers to scientific journals, one of which, on the Pineal eye in lizards, had aroused much interest, and having applied for the professorship of biology at Melbourne in June 1886 was elected to that chair in January 1887./nSpencer arrived in Australia in March of that year and set about organising his new school (the chair had just been founded), successfully receiving a building grant of \u00a38000 to develop new lecture rooms and laboratories. He showed much capability as a lecturer and organiser, and also took a full part in the general activities of the university. His interests were not confined to his university duties; he took a leading part in the proceedings of the Royal Society of Victoria, the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria, and the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science, and did valuable work for those bodies./nIn 1894 a new field was opened up for Spencer when he joined the W.A. Horn scientific expedition which left Adelaide in May 1894 to explore Australia. In July he met Francis James Gillen at Alice Springs with whom he was to be so much associated in the study of the Aboriginal peoples. The expedition covered some 2000 miles in about three months and on his return Spencer busied himself with editing the report, to which he also largely contributed. It was published in 1896. In November 1896 Spencer was again at Alice Springs beginning the work with Gillen which resulted in Native Tribes of Central Australia, published in 1899 and partly opposed by Carl Strehlow and Moritz von Leonhardi. He continued this work with Gillen during the vacations of the two following years. A large amount of material relating to tribal customs was accumulated, and the book appeared with the names of both Gillen and Spencer on the title page. D. J. Mulvaney, writing about Spencer in the Australian Dictionary of Biography, tells us that while Spencer was \"a kindly humanitarian in practice, in theory he saw Aboriginal people simply as dehumanised 'survivals' from an early stage of social development\" and that while records are invaluable, he nonetheless made \"unacceptable value judgements\" on indigenous Australians.[6]/nSpencer was recruited as science writer for the Australasian by its editor, David Watterston.[7]/nSpencer had been appointed a trustee of the public library in 1895. When Sir Frederick McCoy died in May 1899, Spencer became honorary director of the national museum. He was to do an enormous amount of work in the following years, and to present to the museum many valuable collections of sacred and ceremonial Aboriginal objects collected during his journeys. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, London./nIn 1900 and in 1901 he spent 12 months in the field with Gillen going from Oodnadatta to Powell Creek and then eastward to Borraloola on the Gulf of Carpentaria.  They were assisted with their work by the artist and interpreter known to Europeans as Jim Kite, Erlikilyika, who lived at Charlotte Waters telegraph station, where Gillen had previously spent some years.[8] Their experiences and studies formed the basis of the next book, The Northern Tribes of Central Australia, which appeared in 1904, dedicated to David Syme, who had given \u00a31000 towards the cost of the expedition. Patrick (\"Pado\") Byrne, telegraph master at Charlotte Waters, corresponded with Spencer for many years and collected biological specimens. Spencer named a small marsupial known locally as the kowari in recognition of Byrne's contribution as Dasyuroides byrnei.[9]/nIn 1904, Spencer became president of the professorial board, an office he was to hold for seven years. There was then no paid vice-chancellor at Melbourne university and much administrative work fell on Spencer's shoulders. Outside of these duties, he took an interest in the sporting activities of the undergraduates. He was President of the Melbourne University Sports Union and later was the President of the Victorian Football League from 1919 to 1925.[10]\nIn 1911 at the request of the Commonwealth government he led an expedition in the Northern Territory sent to make inquiries into conditions there, and in the following year he published his Across Australia and also accepted the position of special commissioner and chief Protector of Aborigines. The story of this will be found in Native Tribes of the Northern Territory of Australia (1914)./nIn 1914 Spencer was honorary secretary for the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science held in Melbourne. He also did work for the national museum. In 1916 at the request of the Felton Bequest's committee he went to England to obtain an art adviser for the Felton Bequest. He took an interest in Australian artists. He had been made CMG in 1904 and in 1916 he was created a KCMG in 1919 he resigned his professorship and in 1920 became vice-president of the trustees of the public library of Victoria. Spencer was awarded the Clarke Medal in 1923.[11]/nSpencer held very different views on the Aranda people (now often referred to as Arrernte) from missionary Carl Strehlow. Spencer's more pessimistic view saw decline, while Strehlow saw creativity and a future for them. Strehlow's son, Ted Strehlow, mentions this in his book Songs of Central Australia (1971), defending his father from Spencer's criticism. He shows that Spencer and Gillen were limited by their lack of language competence when extracting information from Indigenous peoples, whereas his father was a fluent speaker and writer of the local languages.[12]  Spencer and Gillen famously described the Aranda as \"naked savages... chanting songs of which they do not know the meaning\" in The Northern Tribes of Central Australia (1904).[13]/nA controversy arose in anthropological circles, after Spencer wrote \"angry and to some degree defamatory letters\" to Andrew Lang and Sir James Frazer about Strehlow's work. Strehlow's book, Die Aranda- und Loritja-St\u00e4mme in Zentral-Australien (published in parts, between 1907 and 1920[14]), challenged some of the findings of Spencer and Gillen's The Native Tribes of Central Australia (1899), which had been accepted by anthropologists as a true picture of the Aranda people. This led to a major controversy among British anthropologists, involving Andrew Lang, Sir James Frazer, Robert Ranulph Marett, A.C. Haddon, Spencer and later Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski. The debate centred on whether Aboriginal people were primitive, on a lower level of evolution than Europeans (Frazer and Spencer's view) or a decadent people who had previously been on a higher level of culture (Strehlow's view).[12]/nFrom 1912 to 1922, Spencer attempted to shut down Strehlow's Hermannsburg Mission. In his 1913 report as Special Commissioner and Chief Protector, Spencer proposed taking all Aboriginal children away from their parents and setting up reserves where the children would be denied any contact with their parents, be prevented from speaking their languages and made incapable of living in the bush. While recognising that \"this will undoubtedly be a difficult matter to accomplish and will involve some amount of hardship so far as the parents are concerned\", Spencer justified it on the grounds that \"once the children have grown to a certain age and have become accustomed to camp life with its degrading environment and endless roaming about in the bush, it is almost useless to try and reclaim them\".[15] So he thought it essential to take them away, for \"then they will gradually lose the longing for a nomad life and will in fact become incapable of securing their living in the bush\". He was particularly keen to make sure that \"half-caste\" children had no contact with camp life. Hermannsburg was to be taken away from the Lutherans and \"serve as a reserve for the remnants of the southern central tribes where they can, under proper and competent control, be trained to habits of industry\".[16] However, when the Administrator of the Northern Territory, John A. Gilruth, came down from Darwin in 1913 to see whether these negative reports were true, he was impressed with what he saw and decided that the Strehlows and the mission should remain./nSpencer paid two more visits to the centre of Australia, one in 1923 with Dr Leonard Keith Ward, the government geologist of South Australia, and the other in 1926. These visits enabled Spencer to revise his earlier researches and consider on the spot various opposing theories that had been brought forward. His The Arunta: a Study of a Stone Age People (1927), revisits and reaffirms his earlier conclusions; Gillen's name as joint author appeared on the title-page though he had died 15 years before. Wanderings in Wild Australia, published a year later and slightly more popular in form, completes the list of his books. A list of his other published writings will be found in Spencer's Last Journey (1931). Spencer went to London in 1927 to see these books through the press. Ten years before he had said that he realised he was not getting younger and must regard his field work as finished. In February 1929, however, in his sixty-ninth year, he travelled in a cargo boat to Magallanes and then went in a little schooner to Ushuaia at the south of Tierra del Fuego./nSpencer married Mary Elizabeth ('Lillie') Bowman in January 1887.[1] The couple had two daughters, and a son who died in infancy.[1]/nSpencer died from heart failure on 14 July 1929 during an expedition to Tierra del Fuego, Chile/Argentina.[17] The events leading to his death are recorded in Spencer's own journal entries, and that of his research assistant Jean Hamilton.[17] He was buried in Magallanes (Punta Arenas), Chile.[18]/nIn 2009, an Australian Research Council project was established with the aim of aggregating and digitising the original Spencer and Gillen collection.[19]/nThe Baldwin Spencer Building at the University of Melbourne was built in 1888 and named for Spencer in 1920. it was listed on the Victorian Heritage Register on 24 June 1992.[20]/nIn 1976, Australia Post issued a postage stamp bearing Spencer's portrait./nSpencer is commemorated in the scientific names of two species of Australian lizards: Pseudemoia spenceri and Varanus spenceri.[21]", "15898944": "Moira Brown is a Canadian researcher of the North Atlantic right whale.

She attended McGill University./nBrown taught Physical Education Class  for four years in schools in the West Island District of Montreal, Quebec. She then enrolled in McGill University in Montreal to study renewable resources and graduated with a Bachelor of Science Degree./nBrown worked as a research assistant for Fisheries and Oceans Canada on a project about the history of whaling. In 1985 she started to work as a volunteer at the New England Aquarium, studying North Atlantic right whale population biology in the Bay of Fundy, and later in Cape Cod Bay.[2]  Her studies on right whale genetics commenced in 1988./nAfter working with and studying these whales for ten years, Moira returned to university to pursue a Doctorate Degree from the University of Guelph in Ontario./nBrown worked at the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine, for three years and then became Director at the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, Massachusetts, working for seven years on the conservation of marine mammals and their ecosystem./nAfter a five-year effort by Brown and her colleagues, the International Maritime Organization amended shipping lanes in 2003 to avoid an endangered marine species.[3]/nIn 2004, Brown became a senior scientist at the New England Aquarium in Boston, Massachusetts,[4][5]  where she still conducts marine conservation work focused on diminishing the human-related threats to the right whale population in Canadian waters.[6]/nIn 2016 she is Co-Chair of the North Atlantic Right Whale Recovery-Implementation Team.  She is also a member of the Canadian Whale Institute.[7]/nPhoto identification of whales was first developed in the 1970s and is used extensively during modern  whale studies. Each right whale has physical features that make it unique and distinguishable from the rest. The natural markings of each whale are photographed, and the information is compiled to a computer database./nThe North Atlantic Right Whale Catalogue at the New England Aquarium was started by Scott Kraus in 1990.[8] It contains information related to over 30,000 whale sightings of over 500 individual whales since 1935.  Brown is one of a number of scientists who have contributed to the database.[9]/nScientists and researchers used this information to estimate population numbers: in 2007, the right whale population was estimated to be at 400 whales.  They can determine when and where an individual whale has traveled throughout its lifetime, and monitor whale population demographics, reproductive efforts, mortality, behavior, migration patterns, and occurrence rates of human-caused scarring.[10] Results gathered from this research can then be used to discover species-wide problems and implement recovery strategies, such as the Bay of Fundy Traffic Separation Scheme, enforced in 2003./nThe Natural Resources DNA Profiling and Forensic Centre in Canada has introduced high-resolution genetic profiling for North Atlantic right whale study. Researchers study the declining population of the endangered North Atlantic right whale through both historical and contemporary analysis./nBrown is a member of a team of researchers who are trying to find out why the number of right whales population has so drastically declined.  One theory was that Basque whaling in the 16th and 17th centuries in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence led to the demise. At Red Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador, in 1978, during an investigation of whaling centres of the Strait of Belle Isle (Gulf of St. Lawrence), whale bones were found near a Basque galleon that sank in 1565. Researchers from Parks Canada and the Canadian Museum of Nature analysed the morphology and genetics the bones, but after comparing them with North Atlantic whale bone DNA, they concluded that the Basques primarily hunted bowhead whales, not right whales./nTo study the genetics of contemporary whales, Brown extracts North Atlantic right whale bone DNA by using a Crossbow and biopsy tip to collect whale skin samples. She, works with a team of geneticists at Trent University under the leadership of Bradley White to analyze and record these samples to create a right whale \"family tree\". The data collected from this research can be used to study right whale reproductive biology and the factors that contribute to their reproductive success./nBy implementing one of the most important marine mammal protection measures in Canada, Brown has been recognized with the following awards:", "43620674": "Glenda Elisabeth Gray MB BCh, FC Paeds, DSc (hc), OMS is a South African physician, scientist and activist specializing in the care of children and in HIV medicine. In 2012, she was awarded South Africa's highest honour, the Order of Mapungubwe (Silver).[3] She became the first female president of the South African Medical Research Council[2] in 2014, was recognized as one of the \"100 Most Influential People\" by Time[4][5] in 2017 and was listed amongst \"Africa's 50 Most Powerful Women\" by Forbes Africa in 2020.[6]  Her research expertise involves developing microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV vaccines.[7]/nGray was the fifth of six children born in the gold mining town Boksburg, South Africa in 1962. Her father was a mechanical engineer at the mines and her mother was a bookkeeper. Under the apartheid government of the time, Boksburg was a low income, racially segregated town. Her family were not typical of the residents of the town in that they had black friends.[8]/nGray decided from the age of 6 that she would become a doctor. Her family valued education greatly: her father was the first in his family to attend college and five of the six children went to university. Three of them, including Gray, continued to higher degrees and pursued academic careers, but their father did not live to see this as he died when Gray was 16.[8]/nGray entered the University of the Witwatersrand in 1980 where she studied at the medical school for six years followed by seven years of specialization in pediatrics.[9] Her siblings were already at the university and one of her brothers was involved with a radical student union that was opposed to apartheid. Gray joined the Health Workers Association, a group intent on desegregating South Africa's hospitals. In 1983 the first HIV/AIDS cases and deaths were confirmed in South Africa and Gray committed to educating South African communities about how to prevent HIV.[8]/nBy the time that Gray completed her training as a pediatrician in 1993, HIV was prevalent among many children admitted to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, the largest hospital in Africa,[10] situated on the outskirts of South Africa's largest black township, Soweto. In 1993 Gray, along with colleague James McIntyre, co-founded a perinatal HIV clinic./nIn 1996, Gray started the UNAIDS PETRA study, in five urban settings in South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda, to determine the effectiveness of a shorter anti-retroviral regimen.[11][12] In 1999 she was awarded an International Fogarty Fellowship to study Clinical Epidemiology.[12]/nShe was the executive director of the Perinatal HIV Research Unit (PHRU),[13][14] part of the Medical School of the University of the Witwatersrand, based at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital prior to her appointment as president of the medical research council in 2014.[2] HIV was generally not recorded as a cause of death during the 1990s and 2000s but its effects could be seen in the infant and child mortality rates.[15]/nIn early 2020, an efficacy study for an HIV vaccine led by Gray was stopped early. The study, involving 5407 HIV-uninfected participants, was started in 2016 and should have continued until 2022. However, preliminary data viewed in January 2020 to evaluate safety and efficacy showed 129 HIV infections in the vaccinated group and 123 in the placebo control group. Many HIV scientists did not believe the study would succeed, as a previous efficacy study in Thailand had shown an efficacy of only 31%. Gray believed that owing to the severity of the HIV epidemic in South Africa a new trial was worthwhile pursuing. The independent monitoring board that evaluated the interim results concluded that it was futile to continue with the study.[16]/nGray is a member of the Academy of Science of South Africa, a foreign associate of the United States Institute of Medicine, an A-rated National Research Foundation of South Africa scientist,[5] a co-principal investigator for the HIV Vaccine Trials Network[18] and a fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology.[19][20][21]/nIn addition:/nGray has not been a stranger to controversy. At her first research presentation in 1996 at an international AIDS conference, she championed the position that HIV positive women in developing countries should feed their babies infant formula rather than breast milk to avoid the transmission of HIV from mother to child. The prevailing opinion at that time was that the risk of infant death by diarrheal diseases, caused by mixing contaminated water with the infant formula, outweighed the chance of contracting HIV.[28] Gray's research in the Soweto communities indicated that infant formula could be safely used,[citation needed] but this put her in direct conflict with the activists who had led boycotts against Nestle, because of their infant formula, since the 1970s.[29] Subsequent research on the topic demonstrated high deaths in formula fed compared to breastfed children of HIV-infected mothers.[30][31]/nThe drug Zidovudine (also known as azidothymidine (AZT)) is an anti-retroviral drug that can be used to prevent the transmission of HIV from mother to child during childbirth. The course of the treatment was 14 weeks, and women in developing countries could not afford this. Despite criticism from an editorial of The New England Journal of Medicine, Gray conducted a trial (replicating a study from Thailand) using a shorter course of treatment against a placebo which proved that the shorter couse was effective.[8][32][33] However, the South African government, under president Thabo Mbeki and health minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, refused permission for the drug to be used, as it was considered too expensive. Gray was involved in the clandestine procurement of the drug and treatment of patients, in opposition to the government.[8]/nGray was involved in starting the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), along with Zackie Achmat and others, as an HIV/AIDS activist organisation.[8] Only after Gray received the 2002 Mandela Award for Health and Human Rights and the legal battles in 2003 involving the TAC, were nevirapine, a drug more effective than AZT in preventing mother to child transmission of HIV,[34] and other anti-retrovirals officially sanctioned by the government for use in South Africa.[35] By then, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma had been replaced as Minister of Health by Manto Tshabalala-Msimang and the argument against anti-retrovirals had changed from one of affordability to the endorsement of traditional African medicine over conventional treatment.[36]/nIn 2020, Gray was appointed to the South African government's Medical Advisory Committee owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa. On 26 March 2020, the South African government imposed an almost total lockdown on all inhabitants. From 1 May 2020, the lockdown was gradually lifted under a five-stage plan. On 15 May 2020, Gray said, \"Initially, there was good reason to implement the lockdown to slow down the spread of the virus and buy time to ready the health system, and this was largely achieved\". She now felt that \"the lockdown should be eradicated completely, and that non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), such as handwashing, wearing masks, social distancing and prohibitions on gatherings, should be put in place.\"[37] In addition she noted that:/nShe told the media:[37]/nThis strategy is not based in science and is completely unmeasured.

He founded the field of angiogenesis research, which has led to the discovery of a number of therapies based on inhibiting or stimulating neovascularization.[2]/nBorn in 1933 in Cleveland, Ohio, Judah Folkman accompanied his father, a rabbi, on visits to hospital patients. By age seven, he knew he wanted to be a doctor rather than follow in his father's footsteps, so he could offer cures in addition to comfort. His father replied, \"In that case, you can be a rabbi-like doctor,\" words his son took to heart.[3]/nFolkman graduated from Ohio State University in 1953, and then Harvard Medical School in 1957.[4] While a student at Harvard Medical School, he trained under Robert Edward Gross[5] and also worked on a prototype pacemaker, work that he never published.[6] After his graduation, he started his surgical residency at Massachusetts General Hospital./nIn 1960, his residency was interrupted when he was drafted in the United States Navy and did research for the Navy until 1962 at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.

His curiosity as to why led to his work on angiogenesis.[3]/nAfter his two years work for the navy, Folkman completed his residency at Massachusetts General Hospital.  He worked as an assistant surgeon at Boston City Hospital, then trained further in pediatric surgery at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia under C. Everett Koop.[5]/nIn 1967 he was appointed surgeon-in-chief of Children's Hospital Boston at the age of 34. Folkman was appointed the Julia Dyckman Andrus Professor of Pediatric Surgery at Harvard Medical School in 1968, where he was also Professor of Cell Biology. He was the youngest full Professor at Harvard Medical School in history.[3] In addition to directing the Children's Hospital Boston Surgical Research Laboratories, which grew to become the Vascular Biology Program, for nearly four decades, he was the Scientific Director of the hospital's Vascular Anomalies Center.[3]/nIn 1971, he reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that solid tumors are angiogenesis-dependent.[5][9]  He hypothesized that there was an unknown \"factor\" that tumors secreted to help it increase its blood supply, and that if that factor could be blocked, tumors would wither and die. Though his hypothesis was initially disregarded and treated with skepticism by most experts in the field, Folkman persisted with his research.[4]  He and collaborators, who included Bert L. Vallee, soon identified the already-known fibroblast growth factor as an angiogenic factor, but the team's work showed that there were additional, unknown factors.[2] To help accelerate the work, Folkman started collaborating with industry.[5] In 1974 Harvard University and Monsanto signed a ten-year industrial-funded research grant to support his cancer research, which at that time was the largest such arrangement ever made; medical inventions arising from that research were the first for which Harvard allowed its faculty to submit a patent application.[4][5] Robert Langer worked as a postdoc in Folkman's lab during this time, concentrating on using silastic and other materials to deliver drugs.[5]/nIn the mid to late 1980s, two other angiogenic factors were identified by other labs that had been inspired by his work: angiogenin and VEGF.[5] With the factors identified, drug discovery could begin. When the Monsanto agreement (which yielded no products for Monsanto) ended, Folkman started receiving research funding from Takeda and then from a startup company, Entremed, that put half its venture capital funding into research in the Folkman lab.[5]/nDonald E. Ingber soon discovered that a fungus, Aspergillus fumigatus, secreted a chemical, fumagillin, that inhibited angiogenesis.  Takeda performed medicinal chemistry to optimize it, leading to development of TNP-470.[5] Folkman's team later tested it in adults with hemangiomas; they also used interferon alpha, an already approved drug that they had already shown to be an angiogenesis inhibitor, to treat infants with hemangiomas in some of the first clinical trials of angiogenesis inhibitors which were published in 1992.[10] In these trials they also studied the levels of fibroblast growth factor in the urine of the trial subjects and published that work in 1994; these were some of the first explorations of the use of biomarkers in clinical trials as surrogate endpoints.[5][11]/nIn 1991 Michael O\"Reilly, working in the Folkman lab with Entremed funding, discovered the first endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor, angiostatin and then another, endostatin. Entremed began developing them and soon struck a collaboration with Bristol-Myers, which caught national interest and spurred further investment in angiogenesis inhibitors by other pharma companies.[5][12]/nIn 1993 he surprised the scientific world by hypothesizing that angiogenesis is as important in blood cancers as it is in solid tumors,[13] and the next year he published work showing that a biomarker of angiogenesis was higher in all people with cancer, but especially high in people with blood cancers, and other evidence of the role of angiogenesis in blood cancers emerged as well.[13] Meanwhile, a member of his lab, Robert D'Amato, was looking for angiogenesis inhibitors, and discovered that thalidomide inhibited angiogenesis in 1994.[14][15] Around that time, the wife of a man who was dying of multiple myeloma and whom standard treatments had failed, called Folkman asking him about his anti-angiogenesis ideas.[10] Folkman convinced the patient's doctor to try thalidomide, and that doctor ended up conducting a clinical trial of thalidomide for people with multiple myeloma in which about a third of the subjects responded to the treatment.[10] The results of that trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1999.[10][16]/nIn 2004, the first angiogenesis inhibitor, bevacizumab (Avastin), was approved by the FDA, as a treatment for colon cancer.  It is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that was discovered and developed by Napoleone Ferrara, a scientist at Genentech.[17][18] A similar drug, Lucentis, was later approved for treating macular degeneration.[3] After further work was done by Celgene and others, in 2006 the U.S.\u00a0Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval for thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients.[10][19]/nFolkman was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society, among others.

Meyer (born 1949) is a biologist and genetist, noted for her pioneering research on lambda phage, a virus that infects bacteria; discovery of the master control gene involved in sex determination; and studies of gene regulation, particularly dosage compensation.[1] Meyer's work has revealed mechanisms of sex determination and dosage compensation\u2014that balance X-chromosome gene expression between the sexes in Caenorhabditis elegans that continue to serve as the foundation of diverse areas of study on chromosome structure and function today.[2]/nDr. Meyer is an HHMI investigator, a genetics, genomics and development professor at UC Berkeley, and an adjunct professor in the biochemistry and biophysics department at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)'s School of Medicine. Her current research focuses on the molecular networks controlling dynamic chromosome behaviors during cell development which endure genome stability.[3]/nMeyer is a native Californian, born and raised in Stockton. Meyer completed her undergraduate BS at Stanford University, working with David Clayton. She began her PhD at the University of California, Berkeley and completed her graduate studies in 1979 at Harvard University in the lab of Mark Ptashne, working on gene regulation in lambda phage, a bacterial virus which infects bacteria E. coli. In 1979 Meyer began postdoctoral research at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology,[4] studying how chromosomes determine sex at the laboratory of Sydney Brenner, who later won a Nobel Prize for establishing the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans as an important model organism for research on development. Switching from virus to Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), a roundworm, Meyer still studies gene regulation, but turning to sex determination. Meyer discovered the master gene involved in sex determination./nMeyer's early work focused on how C. elegans \"counts\" the number of X chromosomes and sets of autosomes to determine its sex, as well as how it adjusts to the imbalance in the number of X chromosomes between the two sexes. In C. elegans, individuals with two X chromosomes are self-fertilizing hermaphrodites; those with only one X chromosome are males. A popular hypothesis when Meyer began her postdoctoral work was that the worms compensate for the difference in the number of copies of genes on the X chromosome between the two sexes. But it wasn't clear whether the worms accomplished this by upregulating genes on the X chromosome in males or by downregulating genes on the X chromosome in hermaphrodites. Meyer established her first lab at MIT after leaving the MRC, starting with the question of how the nematode specifies its sex. Further analysis of the mechanism underlying dosage compensation produced many key insights into gene regulation./nIn 1990, Meyer and her husband Tom Cline gave up their tenured positions (she at MIT, he at Princeton) -she accepted a full faculty appointment at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1997, Meyer becomes an HHMI investigator.  Her lab identified a gene they named xol-1 as the master switch for sex determination. Meyer's group also found that transcription factors encoded by both the X chromosome and the autosomes battle to control whether xol-1 is transcriptionally active or inactive.[1]/nShe became a member of ASCB (American association of cell biology) in 1995. She was also elected as a member to AAAS (American academy of Arts and Sciences) in 1995.

Ernst settled in Venezuela in 1861, where he taught at the Central University of Venezuela. He became the most important scientist in the country during the second half of the 19th century and was a key figure in the creation of the Museum of Natural Science and the National Library of Venezuela, where he also served as its director.[1]/nHe developed important scientific works in this country. Also, as a university professor, he had a marked influence on generations of scientists from the second half of the nineteenth century in Venezuela./nHe is regarded as the founder of the Venezuelan positivist school./nHis parents were Adolf Ernst and Catalina Bischoff. He studied high school in his hometown, and then enrolled at the University of Berlin where he studied natural sciences, pedagogy and modern languages. At this German institution, he met two children of the Venezuelan general Judas Tadeo Pi\u00f1ango, with whom he struck up a warm friendship, who encouraged him to travel to Venezuela. On December 2, 1861, he came to Venezuela from Hamburg. on August 5, 1864, he married Enriqueta Tresselt with whom he had five children.[1]/nIn May 1867, now completely adapted to the Venezuelan life, he founded the Society of Physical and Natural Sciences of Caracas and later the National Museum in 1874. In 1876, he became the director of the National Library, in which he gave institution a big boost. During the government of Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Blanco, he participated in the  international exhibitions organization in Vienna (1873), Bremen (1874), Santiago de Chile and Philadelphia (1876). In 1874, at the request of the President, he organized the chair of Natural History at the Central University of Venezuela, where he spread the Lamarck's and Charles Darwin's \"natural selection\" theories, which were fundamental in Zoology and Botany./nHe was the inspiration and founder of positivism in Venezuela, and among his chief disciples were Lisandro Alvarado, Jos\u00e9 Gil Fortoul and Rafael Villavicencio. In 1889, the Central University of Venezuela awarded him the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, in recognition of his academic work. Ernst developed comprehensive research in botany, zoology and ethnography. He also did work in geography, geology, language, anthropology, Physics, paleontology and archeology./nAdolph Ernst carried out important studies in different regions of Venezuela, such as the Caracas valley, Lake Maracaibo, the Andes, the Venezuelan Guayana, the island of La Orchila, the Aroa copper mines and Betijoque diamond mines. He created the precursor of ethnobotany in Venezuela by developing themes such as Historia de la Yuca (1890) and El Banano (1893). The ethnographic and archaeological collections acquired by the National Museum formed the basis for publishing a series of descriptive anthropological works of diverse indigenous groups in the country: Wayuu, Ayamanes, Warao. In relation to his archaeological work, he emphasized work on the Andean region, which specifically described the lytic plaques also known as the \"Batwing\". He also provided ethnographic data on Andean Aboriginals and spent time with petroglyphs (1885-1889). One of Adolf Ernst's main merits was his disclosing Venezuelan material to the international scientific societies of the nineteenth century, and publishing their contributions in journals such as Globus, Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Ethnologie, American Anthropologist and in the Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Anthropologie Paris.", "2890103": "Charlotte \"Lotte\" Auerbach FRS FRSE (14 May 1899 \u2013 17 March 1994) was a German geneticist who contributed to founding the science of mutagenesis.

In 1929 she abandoned her work with Mangold: he would later join the Nazi party, and Auerbach found his dictatorial manner unpleasant. In reply to her suggestion to change direction of her project, he replied \"You are my student, you do as I say.

Giles made important scientific contributions in the areas of intragenic complementation, gene conversion and analysis of gene clusters.  His early work on intragenic complementation led to the insight that complementation between allelic mutants is of widespread occurrence and likely involves interactions occurring in the cytoplasm between defective gene products, that is between polypeptides.[1]  This early insight led to numerous further studies of intragenic complementation that amplified this initial insight (see for example[2])./n/nThis article about an American scientist is a stub.

Clokie earned her doctoral degree in molecular ecology at the University of Leicester in 2001[4] for research on the evolution of three genera of plants: Eucryphia, Griselinia and Coriaria.[3]/nAfter her PhD, Clokie was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Warwick and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.[3] Clokie started her research career investigating the molecular evolution of plants.[5]/nClokie joined the University of Leicester as a lecturer in 2007 and was promoted to Professor in 2016.[3][1] She is interested in viruses known as bacteriophages which can be used to treat disease. Her work involves cyanobacteria and the sequencing of various bacteriophages.[6] She demonstrated that marine phages contain the genes responsible for photosynthesis, and that phages do not only exert pressure on the infection-survival mechanism of cyanobacteria but can acquire the genes of a bacteria's prey.[5]/nHer research includes identifying specific phage combinations that can be used to destroy Clostridioides difficile Infections (CDI) while maintaining a healthy gut.[7][8] CDI causes almost two fifths of diarrhoea associated with antibiotics in the Western world, and one in ten of patients die due to a lack of effective treatment.[7][9] The bacteriophage could reduce the growth of C. difficile and simultaneously defend beneficial bacterial that are typically destroyed by antibiotics.[7] The bacteriophages can be delivered orally and result in destruction of C. difficile within two days.[7][10] Clokie went on to demonstrate that C. difficile can evolve into a new species, with a specific strand that is adapted to spread quickly in hospitals.[11] The new species survives on the sugar-rich diets of Westerners and can evade common disinfectants.[11]/nShe has also worked on bacteriophages that can be used to prevent bacterial infections in Antheraea assamensis (Muga silkworms).[12] Muga silk is produced in Assam and is one of the most valuable silks in the world. They are at risk from Flacherie, a bacterial disease that is caused by larvae eating infected leaves.[12] Alongside working on silk worms, Clokie has explored the use of phages in the treatment of drug resistant urinary tract infections. She has shown that bacteriophages could be used to treat bacterial disease in pigs.[13][14] These phages disable the Salmonella bacterial disease that infects pigs and can be added to pig feed.[14]/nClokie maintained bacteriophages were helping growing numbers of patients in compassionate use cases and could become routine for conditions like chronic UTIs and diabetic foot ulcers.  Clokie stated \u201cThe risk from antibiotic resistance is dire and getting worse \u2026 I find it really shocking.  Unless we have clinical trials, phages won\u2019t become mainstream as a medicine, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re aiming.(...) I get fairly regular emails from doctors and patients wanting phages.

Tocchini-Valentini is an Italian molecular biologist. As of 2009, he was elected as a foreign associate of the National Academy of Sciences, affiliated with the National Research Council of Italy (CNR).[1] In his forty plus years in molecular biology, he has published over 140 papers on topics like mutagenesis, RNA molecules, structure, function and evolution, disease models, neurodegenerative diseases, and cognitive disorders.[1] He currently resides in Rome, Italy as director at the Institute of Cell Biology. He is also the coordinator for European Mouse Mutant Archive, also known as EMMA.[2] Currently, he is actively advocating advancement in infrastructure for science buildings across Europe./nTocchini-Valentini graduated the University Rome La Sapienza in 1959, interested in producing special phosphates in order to synthesize RNA. He pursued his interests at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Karlsruhe, Germany, where he became a radiobiologist in their Institute of Radiology.[3] At the end of his fellowship, Tocchini-Valentini went on teach at the University of Chicago, where he published numerous papers on asymmetrical transcription in collaboration with Franco Graziosi, Peter Geiduschek, Robert Haselkorn, and Samuel Weiss. After leaving University of Chicago in 1996, he returned to Italy, where he is currently affiliated with the National Research Council of Italy./nGlauco Tocchini-Valentini's early research focused on demonstrating genetic transcription as an asymmetric process.[4] His publication on findings of asymmetric synthesis of RNA in vitro concluded that the synthesis of mRNA and rRNA is asymmetric whereas DNA yielded symmetric synthesis.[5] From there, he aided in isolating, characterizing, and discovering several enzymes involved in the transcription process, such as DNA and RNA polymerases, rDNA cistrons, and Typell DNA topoisomerase.[6][7][8] Much of his work was characterized using various Xenopus laevis cell types, including oocytes, unfertilized eggs, and kidney cells; the characteristics of these amphibian cells and their enzymes were related to mammalian cells and their respective enzymes.[6]/nTocchini-Valentini has also contributed to current understanding of enzyme-substrate rules, stemming from his publication on RNase P and endonuclease from Xenopus laevis cell types.[9][10] He characterized the tRNA endonucleases of Archaea, finding three forms of tRNA endonuclease.[11] His current research focus is using an archaeal endonuclease (MJ-EndA) to control splicing in both live mice and mice lines.[12] This emergent technology, which can perform both cis- and trans-splicing, allows perturbations to be introduced at the RNA level, thus allowing more specific targeting in mRNA as well as other RNAs.[12] More recently, his research focuses on improving phenotyping data by using \"soft windowing.\" which use adaptive windows of time to include certain controls to result in better analysis across small variations in experiments.[13] He is also involved in the Deep Genome Project, a project which focuses on sequencing all analogous genes in mice as humans in order to better understand disease models and mechanisms.[14] Through phenotyping screens of these mice, genetic components of metabolism and auditory dysfunction has been identified.[15][16]/nTocchini-Valentini has filed several patents pertaining to RNA cleavage and recombination.[17] The following two have been approved by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO): method of RNA cleavage and method of RNA cleavage and recombination./nIn 2003, the RNA cleavage method[18] first exposes the target molecule (not containing a tRNA structure[19]) to a eukaryotic tRNA splicing endonuclease. This puts the molecule in the bulge-helix-bulge conformation,[20] and cleavage occurs in this formation, resulting in cleavage products. The cleavage reaction can occur both in vitro and in vivo, and it is mainly used to demonstrate the presence of specific RNAs in samples. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), the target molecule can be labeled and fluorescence would be measured upon cleavage of the oligonucleotide./nIn continuation of this previous patent, he filed a follow up patent in 2004, which was approved on August 20, 2013.[21] As described previously, the RNA molecule is cleaved within the bulge-helix-bulge. As the target RNA molecule and the exogenous RNA molecule are treated with the correct ligase, RNA chimeras form.[22][23] This results in the recombination of the target RNA and the exogenous RNA across the bulge-helix-bulge structure, thus this method can also be used for recombining RNA molecules in order to alter RNA function and hence gene expression.[24]/nTocchini-Valentini was awarded the San Giacomo Della Marca Prize in 2007.

He was responsible for the first definitions of fish schools in ichthyology. An undersea mountain in the Atlantic, a Cape on Eva-Liv Island, and a mountain in Antarctica are named after Mesyatsev./nMesyatsev was born in what is now Krasnodar Krai and studied at the Vladikavkaz gymnasium and St Petersburg Institute of Technology before going to Moscow University where he graduated in 1912. He worked on embryology and histology but an interest in marine fishes was sparked after a visit to the marine biological stations in France in 1910. He taught at Moscow University for a while and in 1920 he worked as part of a scientific fisheries expedition into the Barents Sea. An active member of the communist party, he received support from V.I. Lenin for his work. In 1921 he helped establish a floating marine laboratory (Plavmornin) and helped set up the wooden research vessel Perseus which was used for numerous expeditions.[1][2] A firm believer in equal rights, he encouraged women oceanographers and the Perseus mission had nearly thirteen women on expeditions including Maria Klenova.[3] In 1929 he headed the State Oceanographic Institute which later became the VNIRO (The Russian oceanographic research institute) and in 1934 he headed the commission to examine the fish resources of the Caspian Sea.[4][5]", "2890145": "William Thomas Astbury FRS (25 February 1898 \u2013 4 June 1961) was an English physicist and molecular biologist who made pioneering X-ray diffraction studies of biological molecules.[2] His work on keratin provided the foundation for Linus Pauling's discovery of the alpha helix. He also studied the structure for DNA in 1937 and made the first step in the elucidation of its structure./nAstbury was the fourth child of seven, born in Longton, Stoke-on-Trent.  His father, William Edwin Astbury, was a potter and provided comfortably for his family. Astbury also had a younger brother, Norman, with whom he shared a love of music.[citation needed]/nAstbury might well have become a potter but, luckily, won a scholarship to Longton High School, where his interests were shaped by the Headmaster and second master, both chemists. After becoming head boy and winning the Duke of Sutherland's gold medal, Astbury won the only local scholarship available and went up to Jesus College, Cambridge.[citation needed]/nAfter two terms at Cambridge, his studies were interrupted by service during the First World War. A poor medical rating following appendectomy resulted in his posting in 1917 to Cork, Ireland with the Royal Army Medical Corps. He later returned to Cambridge and finished his last year with a specialization in physics./nAfter graduating from Cambridge, Astbury worked with William Bragg, first at University College London and then, in 1923, at the Davy-Faraday Laboratory at the Royal Institution in London. Fellow students included many eminent scientists, including Kathleen Lonsdale and J. D. Bernal and others. Astbury showed great enthusiasm for his studies and published papers in the journal Classic Crystallography, such as on the structure of tartaric acid./nIn 1928, Astbury was appointed Lecturer in Textile Physics at the University of Leeds.  He remained at Leeds for the remainder of his career, being appointed Reader in Textile Physics in 1937 and Professor of Biomolecular Structure in 1946.  He held the chair until his death in 1961.  He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1940.[3] He is commemorated by the Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology at Leeds.[4]/nIn later life he was given many awards and honorary degrees./nAt Leeds Astbury studied the properties of fibrous substances such as keratin and collagen with funding from the textile industry. (Wool consists of keratin.) These substances did not produce sharp patterns of spots like crystals, but the patterns provided physical limits on any proposed structures.  In the early 1930s, Astbury showed that there were drastic changes in the diffraction of moist wool or hair fibres as they are stretched significantly (100%). The data suggested that the unstretched fibres had a coiled molecular structure with a characteristic repeat of 5.1 \u00c5 (=0.51\u00a0nm). Astbury proposed that (1) the unstretched protein molecules formed a helix (which he called the \u03b1-form); and (2) the stretching caused the helix to uncoil, forming an extended state (which he called the \u03b2-form). Although incorrect in their details, Astbury's models were correct in essence and correspond to modern elements of secondary structure, the \u03b1-helix and the \u03b2-strand (Astbury's nomenclature was kept), which were developed twenty years later by Linus Pauling and Robert Corey in 1951. Hans Neurath was the first to show that Astbury's models could not be correct in detail, because they involved clashes of atoms. Neurath's paper and Astbury's data inspired H. S. Taylor (1941,1942) and Maurice Huggins (1943) to propose models of keratin that are very close to the modern \u03b1-helix./nIn 1931, Astbury was also the first to propose that mainchain-mainchain hydrogen bonds (i.e., hydrogen bonds between the backbone amide groups) contributed to stabilizing protein structures. His initial insight was taken up enthusiastically by several researchers, including Linus Pauling./nAstbury's work moved on to include X-ray studies of many proteins (including myosin, epidermin[5] and fibrin) and he was able to deduce from their diffraction patterns that the molecules of these substances were coiled and folded. This work led him to the conviction that the best way to understand the complexity of living systems was through studying the shape of the giant macromolecules from which they are made \u2013 an approach which he popularised with passion as 'molecular biology'. His other great passion was classical music and once said that protein fibres such as keratin in wool were 'the chosen instruments on which nature has played so many incomparable themes, and countless variations and harmonies'[6] These two passions converged when in 1960 he presented an X-ray image taken by his research assistant Elwyn Beighton of a fibre of keratin protein in a lock of hair that was said to have come from Mozart \u2013 who was one of Astbury's favourite composers.[7]/nBut proteins were not the only biological fibre that Astbury studied. In 1937 Torbj\u00f6rn Caspersson of Sweden sent him well prepared samples of DNA from calf thymus. The fact that DNA produced a diffraction pattern indicated that it also had a regular structure and it might be feasible to deduce it. Astbury was able to obtain some external funding and he employed the crystallographer Florence Bell. She recognised that the \"beginnings of life [were] clearly associated with the interaction of proteins and nucleic acids\".[8] Bell and Astbury published an X-ray study on DNA in 1938, describing the nucleotides as a \"Pile of Pennies\".[9]/nAstbury and Bell reported that DNA's structure repeated every 2.7 nanometres and that the bases lay flat, stacked, 0.34 nanometres apart.[10] At a symposium in 1938 at Cold Spring Harbor,[11] Astbury pointed out that the 0.34 nanometre spacing was the same as amino acids in polypeptide chains. (The currently accepted value for the spacing of the bases in B-form of DNA is 0.332\u00a0nm.)/nIn 1946 Astbury presented a paper at a symposium in Cambridge in which he said: \"Biosynthesis is supremely a question of fitting molecules or parts of molecules against another, and one of the great biological developments of our time is the realisation that probably the most fundamental interaction of all is that between the proteins and the nucleic acids.\" He also said that the spacing between the nucleotides and the spacing of amino acids in proteins \"was not an arithmetical accident\"./nAstbury and Bell's work was significant for two reasons. Firstly they showed that X-ray crystallography could be used to reveal the regular, ordered structure of DNA \u2013 an insight which laid the foundations for the later work of Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin,[2] after which the structure of DNA was identified by Francis Crick and James D. Watson in 1953. Secondly, they did this work at a time when most scientists thought that proteins were the carrier of hereditary information and that DNA was a dull monotonous molecule of little interest other than perhaps as a structural component. In 1944, Astbury was one of the few scientists to recognise the importance of work done by the microbiologist Oswald Avery and his Rockefeller colleagues Maclyn McCarty and Colin Macleod. Avery and his team had shown that nucleic acid could pass on the property of virulence in pneumococcus and thus offered the first strong evidence that DNA might be the hereditary material.[12]/nAstbury described Avery's work as 'one of the most remarkable discoveries of our time'[13] and it inspired him with the vision that, in the aftermath of World War 2, he would established a new department at Leeds that would become a national centre to blaze the trail for the new science of molecular biology. Writing to the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Leeds in 1945 he declared that 'all biology, is now passing over into the molecular structural phase...In all branches of biology and all universities this thing must come to pass and I suggest that Leeds should be bold and help to lead the way.'[14]/nSadly, not everyone shared his dream. The University Senate allowed him to establish a new department but would not allow him to use the phrase 'molecular biology' in the title due to opposition from senior biologists who felt that, as a physicist, Astbury was encroaching without invitation on intellectual territory that they rightfully considered to be their own. The Senate also granted him premises but these were a far cry from what he had hoped for. His new department was housed in a Victorian terraced house that required substantial conversion, with uneven floors that made delicate scientific equipment wobble, a faulty electrical supply and unreliable plumbing that sometimes led to flooding. To add to his woes, the Medical Research Council rejected his application for funding./nDespite these set-backs, two important developments took place in Astbury's new department. The first was the elucidation of the mechanism by which thrombin acts as a protease to catalyse the formation of the major component of blood clots, the insoluble protein fibrin, from its soluble precursor fibrinogen by Laszlo Lorand, a young PhD student who had fled his native Hungary to join Astbury. Lorand's work was a major discovery in our understanding of the process by which blood clots form./nThe second development was a series of new X-ray photographs of B-form DNA taken in 1951 by Astbury's research assistant Elwyn Beighton which the historian of science, Professor Robert Olby has since said was 'clearly the famous B-pattern found by Rosalind Franklin and R. Gosling'. Olby was referring to an X-ray image of B-form DNA that was taken a year later by Rosalind Franklin and her PhD student Raymond Gosling at King's College a year later which came to be known as 'Photo 51' Despite its modest name this image was to play an important role in the story of DNA and a plaque on the wall outside King's College, London hails it as 'one of the most important photographs in the world'. This is because the image shows a striking cross-shaped pattern of black spots made by X-rays as they are scattered by the DNA fibre and when James Watson was first shown Franklin and Gosling's picture, this cross-shaped pattern made him so excited that he said 'my mouth fell open and my pulse began to race',[15] because he knew that only a molecule coiled into a helical shape could scatter X-rays to give this particular pattern./nFranklin and Gosling's 'Photo 51' provided one of several important clues to Watson and Crick -but Astbury's response to Beighton's very similar X-ray images of DNA could not have been more different. He never published them in a journal or presented them at a scientific meeting. Given that Astbury was such a renowned expert in X-ray studies of biological molecules this apparent neglect of such an important clue may seem surprising. One explanation is that, although Astbury recognised the importance of DNA, he did not understand that biological information was carried in the one-dimensional sequence of bases within the molecule but rather, that it resided in subtle and elaborate variations in its three-dimensional structure. Far from making his jaw drop and his pulse race, the revelation that DNA was a simple a twisting helix would therefore have been a disappointment but it is intriguing to speculate on how differently history might have unfolded had Astbury shown Beighton's image to his friend and colleague the eminent US chemist and Nobel Laureate, Linus Pauling when he visited Astbury at his home in Headingley, Leeds in 1952. Pauling was, at that time, Watson and Crick's greatest rival in trying to solve the structure of DNA and was desperate to obtain a good quality X-ray diffraction image of DNA. In 1952, he had already proposed an incorrect model of DNA based on Astbury and Bell's early work but had Astbury shown Pauling these new images taken by Beighton, it might well have been Caltech, Pasadena and not Cambridge, UK that is today remembered for the discovery of the double-helix. Despite this missed opportunity, Astbury, together with Florence Bell, had made a major contribution by showing that the methods of X-ray crystallography could be used to reveal the regular, ordered structure of DNA./nBut perhaps Astbury's greatest scientific legacy was his rather unusual overcoat. In the late 1930s Astbury and his collaborators A.C. Chibnall and Kennet Bailey showed that by chemical treatment, the molecular chains of soluble seed proteins could be refolded to make them into insoluble fibres. The company ICI was so interested in this idea that they built a pilot production plant in Scotland to a new textile fibre called 'Ardil' that was produced by deliberately altering the molecular structure of the main soluble protein component of monkeynuts to refold it into an insoluble fibre in the hope of using this as a cheap and abundant substitute for wool as a raw material in the textile industry. To demonstrate the feasibility of this idea, ICI made an entire overcoat from Ardil which Astbury regularly sported to lectures and in the end, although Ardil did not prove to be the salvation of the British textile industry, it did serve as a powerful illustration of Astbury's conviction that not only could we solve the structure of giant biomolecules such as proteins and DNA using X-rays, but that we might also then deliberately manipulate these structures for our own practical purposes./nThis was an idea which truly came of age in the mid- to late 1970s with the rise of recombinant DNA technology by which time Astbury was dead but as his friend and colleague, J.D.Bernal wrote in an obituary to him, 'His monument will be found in the whole of molecular biology'.[16]/nAstbury was known for his unfailing cheerfulness, idealism, imagination and enthusiasm. He foresaw correctly the tremendous impact of molecular biology and transmitted his vision to his students, \"his euphoric evangelizing zeal transforming laboratory routine into a great adventure\".[17] Astbury's enthusiasm may also account for an occasional lack of scientific caution observable in his work; Astbury could make speculative interpretations sound plausible./nAstbury was an excellent writer and lecturer; his works are characterized by remarkable clarity and an easy-going, natural manner. He also enjoyed music, playing both piano and violin./nAstbury met Frances Gould when he was stationed in Cork, Ireland with the Royal Army Medical Corps during World War I. They married in 1922 and had a son, Bill, and a daughter, Maureen.", "629154": "John Corrigan \"Jonathan\" Wells (born 1942) is an American theologian and advocate of the pseudoscientific argument of intelligent design.[1] Wells joined the Unification Church in 1974, and subsequently wrote that the teachings of its founder Sun Myung Moon, his own studies at the Unification Theological Seminary and his prayers convinced him to devote his life to \"destroying Darwinism.\" The term Darwinism is often used by intelligent design proponents and other creationists to refer to the scientific consensus on evolution.[2][3][4][5] He gained a PhD in religious studies at Yale University in 1986, then became Director of the Unification Church's inter-religious outreach organization in New York City. In 1989, he studied at the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a PhD in molecular and cellular biology in 1994. He became a member of several scientific associations and has published in academic journals./nIn his book Icons of Evolution: Science or Myth? (2000), Wells argues that a number of examples used to illustrate biology textbooks were grossly exaggerated, distorted truth, or were patently false. Wells said that this shows that evolution conflicts with the evidence, and so argued against its teaching in public education.[6][7][8] Some reviewers of Icons of Evolution have said that Wells misquoted experts cited as sources and took minor issues out of context, basing his argument on a flawed syllogism.[7][9] Wells's views on evolution have been rejected by the scientific community.[4][6][10]/nWells was born in New York City in 1942 and grew up in New Jersey, and was brought up as a Protestant Christian. He studied geology at Princeton University, where he dropped out in his junior year. Following a brief stint as a taxi driver, he was drafted into the United States Army and spent two years serving in Germany. After his discharge in 1966, he attended University of California, Berkeley, where he publicly refused to report for reserve duty. This resulted in him being arrested and being incarcerated for eighteen months at the Leavenworth military prison. Upon his release, Wells returned to Berkeley where he completed his studies with a major in geology and physics and a minor in biology./nIn 1974, Wells joined the Unification Church of the United States.[11] He graduated from the Unification Church's Unification Theological Seminary in 1978 with a master's degree in religious education.[12] Wells continued his studies at Yale University, earning a PhD in religious studies in 1986, focusing on historical reactions to Darwinism.[13] During this time he wrote extensively on Unification theology and taught at the Unification Theological Seminary.[12] Wells was on the Board of Trustees of the Unification Theological Seminary until resigning in 1997 to return to teaching.[14] He also acted as the director of the International Religious Foundation, a Unification Church affiliated organization which sponsors interdenominational conferences.[15][16]/nWells has written on the subject of marriage within the Unification Church and has been called a \"Unification Church marriage expert\" by church sources.[17][18][19] Wells defended Unification Church theology against what he said were unfair criticisms of it made in 1977 by the National Council of Churches.[15]/nIn 1994, Wells earned another PhD in molecular and cellular biology at UC Berkeley.[13] After receiving his doctorate, he worked at a position he described as \"a post-doctoral research biologist at Berkeley, writing articles critical of Darwinism.\"[3] Shortly after that Wells joined Phillip E. Johnson, father of the intelligent design movement, at the Discovery Institute.[12] He now serves as a fellow at the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture,[20] the hub of the intelligent design movement, and at the International Society for Complexity, Information, and Design,[21] which also promotes intelligent design.[22]/nWells appeared on a panel at Harvard with Stephen Palumbi in November 2001, which his supporters lauded as a \"home run\".[23][24][25][26] Other observers stated that Wells' performance was \"uneventful\".[27]/nOf his student days at Unification Theological Seminary (1976\u201378), Wells said, \"One of the things that Father [Reverend Sun Myung Moon] advised us to do at UTS was to pray to seek God's plan for our lives.\" Wells later described that plan: \"To defend and articulate Unification theology especially in relation to Darwinian evolution.\"[28]/nWells stated that his religious doctoral studies at Yale, which were paid for by the Unification Church, focused on the \"root of the conflict between Darwinian evolution and Christian doctrine\" and encompassed the whole of Christian theology within a focus of Darwinian controversies.[3][29] He said:/n...I learned (to my surprise) that biblical chronology played almost no role in the 19th- century controversies, since most theologians had already accepted geological evidence for the age of the earth and re-interpreted the days in Genesis as long periods of time. Instead, the central issue was design.[3]/nWells said that \"destroying Darwinism\" was his motive for studying Christian theology at Yale and going on to seek his second PhD at Berkeley, studying biology and in particular embryology:/nFather's [Rev. Moon's] words, my studies, and my prayers convinced me that I should devote my life to destroying Darwinism, just as many of my fellow Unificationists had already devoted their lives to destroying Marxism. When Father chose me (along with about a dozen other seminary graduates) to enter a Ph.D. program in 1978, I welcomed the opportunity to prepare myself for battle.[3]/nWells's statement and others like it are viewed by the scientific community as evidence that Wells lacks proper scientific objectivity and mischaracterizes evolution by ignoring and misrepresenting the evidence supporting it while pursuing an agenda promoting notions supporting his religious beliefs in its place.[30][31][32]/nHe has written articles for the Discovery Institute, WorldNetDaily, Origins & Design, and other sympathetic publications attacking evolution and defending intelligent design.[33] In 1997, he presented a paper entitled \"Evolution by Design\" at the Unification Church sponsored International Conference on the Unity of the Sciences in Washington, D.C.[34]/nIn 1999, Wells debated with the New Mexicans for Science and Reason.[35] He was one of the contributors to Natural History magazine's 2002 debate between intelligent design advocates and evolution supporters.[36] In 2005, he debated Massimo Pigliucci on the PBS talk show Uncommon Knowledge.[37] Pigliucci said that Wells \"clearly lied\" during his debates and misrepresented his agenda and science, as well as not understanding some of the theories he tried to attack.[38][39]/nWells is one of the signatories of the Discovery Institute's \"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism,\" a petition which the intelligent design movement uses to promote intelligent design by attempting to cast doubt on evolution.[40][41] He is also the author of \"Ten questions to ask your biology teacher about evolution\" for high school students, which is published by the Discovery Institute.[42] The National Center for Science Education has issued a list of answers to the questions.[42][43][44]/nIn 2000 Wells published his book Icons of Evolution, in which he discusses 10 examples which he says show that many of the most commonly accepted arguments supporting evolution are invalid.[45]/nThere have been 12 detailed reviews of Icons, from scholars familiar with the subject matter, which have come to the consensus that the book's claims are a politically motivated exaggeration and misrepresentation of a scattering of minor issues.[9]  Scholars quoted in the work have accused Wells of purposely misquoting them and misleading readers.[46][47] Jerry Coyne wrote of Icons, \"Wells's book rests entirely on a flawed syllogism: ... textbooks illustrate evolution with examples; these examples are sometimes presented in incorrect or misleading ways; therefore evolution is a fiction.\"[7][48][49][50][51][52][53][54]/nIn 2005, Wells participated in the Kansas evolution hearings, which were boycotted by mainstream scientists. There Wells testified:/nI became convinced that the Darwinian theory is false because it conflicts with the evidence. ... I think the earth is probably four-and-a-half billion or so years old. But I'll tell you this, I used to-- I would have said, a few years ago, I'm convinced it's four-and-a-half billion years old. But the truth is I have not looked at the evidence. And I have become increasingly suspicious of the evidence that is presented to me and that's why at this point I would say probably it's four-and-a-half billion years old, but I haven't looked at the evidence. ... There are already scientists-- respected scientists in this country who do experiments on things that most people consider supernatural, such as prayer. When Newton proposed the theory of gravitation it was dismissed as supernaturalism because it was action at a distance. What constitutes supernaturalism in today's science may very well not be supernatural in tomorrow's science.[55]/nPrior to the evolution hearings, in December 2000 after the Pratt County, Kansas, school board revised its tenth-grade biology curriculum at the urging of intelligent design proponents to include material that encourages students to question the theory of evolution, The Pratt Tribune published a letter from  Jerry Coyne challenging Wells's characterization in an article of his work on peppered moths, saying that his article appended to the Pratt standards was misused and being mischaracterized:/nCreationists such as Jonathan Wells claim that my criticism of these experiments casts strong doubt on Darwinism. But this characterization is false. ... My call for additional research on the moths has been wrongly characterized by creationists as revealing some fatal flaw in the theory of evolution. ... It is a classic creationist tactic (as exemplified in Wells' book, \"Icons of Evolution\") to assert that healthy scientific debate is really a sign that evolutionists are either committing fraud or buttressing a crumbling theory.[47]/nIn 2006, Wells published his second major book, The Politically Incorrect Guide to Darwinism and Intelligent Design, which was part of a series published by Regnery Publishing. The book was praised by Tom Bethell, author of The Politically Incorrect Guide to Science (2005),[56] but was described by Reed A. Cartwright of The Panda's Thumb weblog as being \"not only politically incorrect but incorrect in most other ways as well: scientifically, logically, historically, legally, academically, and morally.\"[57] Cartwright also edited a chapter-by-chapter critique of the book.[57] A quote from the book linking evolution to eugenics, abortion and racism appeared on Starbucks paper cups in 2007.[58]/nIn 1991, Wells and his mentor Phillip E. Johnson signed an open letter which said in full:/nIt is widely believed by the general public that a retrovirus called HIV causes the group [of] diseases called AIDS. Many biochemical scientists now question this hypothesis. We propose that a thorough reappraisal of the existing evidence for and against this hypothesis be conducted by a suitable independent group. We further propose that critical epidemiological studies be devised and undertaken.[59][60][61]/nWells and Johnson have been criticized, along with others, for their questioning of the scientific and medical consensus that HIV causes AIDS.[61]  In the Washington University Law Review, Matthew J. Brauer, Barbara Forrest, and Steven G.

In 1977, he appeared on an episode of the popular television series In Search Of entitled \"Martians\" and he spoke about the Viking's findings up to that time. \"We have started what will become an adventure of mankind in searching for not only the lower forms of life but also the search for intelligent life.  This is one of the milestones in the course of human destiny to find cousins\".  Soffen also predicted that mankind would eventually colonize Mars by using Planetary Engineering.[4]/nHe moved to become NASA Langley's Chief Environmental Scientist in 1968,[5] leading work on remote sensing by satellite as well as laboratory experiments, ground-based measurements, and theoretical models./nIn 1978, after concluding his work with Viking, Soffen became the director of Life Sciences at NASA Headquarters. In this position, Soffen was responsible for the agency-wide program to monitor and maintain the physical well being of NASA astronauts in space, as well as the Biomedical Program, the Space Biology Program, and the Exobiology (also sometimes called the Astrobiology) program.  If you ever heard him speak, you know that he was the oratorical equal of luminaries like Carl Sagan. Like Sagan, Soffen spoke cogently, succinctly, and poetically about our search for life beyond earth./nIn 1983, Soffen transferred from NASA Headquarters to NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, Maryland. Initially, his role at GSFC focused on establishing the \"Mission to Planet Earth\" program; Soffen also served as the project scientist for NASA's Earth Observing System as that program was starting./nSoffen's focus shifted to education starting in 1990, when he led the formation of GSFC's University Programs office and became its manager. Three years into that role, Soffen created NASA Academy, NASA's premiere leadership training internship.[6] During 1990\u20131992, he served on the Science Advisory Committee for Biosphere 2./nSoffen has been memorialized in several ways by his peers and former students. The \"Dr. Gerald A. Soffen Memorial Fund for the Advancement of Space Science Education\" was established by the NASA Academy Alumni Association \"to continue Jerry's commitment to the future of space by supporting motivated students in the fields of space science and engineering\".[7] The \"Gerald Soffen Memorial Panel/Lecture\" is also a feature of the annual Space Studies program conducted by International Space University./nThe Viking 2 lander was posthumously named after Soffen.[8] Additionally, a crater on Mars was named \"Soffen\" in 2006.[9] The crater is centered at 23.73 degrees S, 140.86 degrees E on Mars.[10]", "29628839": "Daniel Simon Mills, FRCVS (born 21 August 1966) is an English veterinarian and biologist and the UK's first Professor of Veterinary Behavioural Medicine based at the University of Lincoln, United Kingdom.

He has an active teaching and research portfolio.  His research has focused on the assessment of emotion in companion animals and the use of semiochemicals to manage their problem behaviour (pheromonatherapy[1]). He has led the development of what has become known as the psychobiological approach to animal behaviour assessment,[2] and has published more than 200 full scientific papers, books and chapters.[3]/nAmong his achievements are becoming the first person within the UK to be recognized as a specialist in veterinary behavioural medicine by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.[4]  and being awarded Fellowship of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons in 2016 in recognition of his contribution to the field. In 2020 he was also listed in the top 2% of scientists in the world[5]  and in 2021 was in the top 1% of cited scientists.[6] The psychobiological approach to animal behaviour assessment, which he has pioneered, provides a scientific framework for making inferences about motivational and emotional state in animals.[7]  His recognised practical achievements include the development of the Lincoln stable mirror to assist horses with isolation problems[8] and validation of the use of animal pheromones [9] to influence unwanted behaviour; he has also developed a series of freely available, validated, psychometric instruments[10] for assessment of emotional predisposition in dogs.

He pioneered new medical techniques, discovered new infectious agents, and trained countless researchers and scientists. Meyers was particularly well known for his work with Hansen's disease (Leprosy), Buruli ulcer, and filarial diseases./nMeyers was born on a small farm in west central Pennsylvania, in Huntingdon County. Most of his ancestors were farmers. His father was a farmer and a carpenter, and worked as a carpenter on steamboats going up and down the Mississippi from Pittsburgh to New Orleans. His mother was born on the farm that she lived on all her life. Meyers attended the local elementary one-room school and later went to a consolidated high school in Saxton, Pennsylvania. In 1941 he started his studies at Juniata College, in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, where he majored in chemistry and mathematics.[3]/nHis studies were interrupted by World War II. He was drafted in 1944, when he was more than three years through college, and served in a signal company in an infantry division, in the South Pacific. He spent most of his service time in the Philippines serving mainly as a cryptographer in the 43rd Infantry Division. At the end of World War II, he was in Luzon, and went to Japan in the Army of Occupation.[3]/nAfter the war, he was able to return to Juniata College and obtain his chemistry degree.  Then he went to work with U.S. Steel as a research chemist in Pittsburgh. He wanted, however, to do humanitarian work, and having a strong religious background he decided that perhaps missionary work would be the best way to fulfill this. So, he went to Moody Bible Institute in Chicago. During that time, he realized that medicine was the field in which he could best serve. To accomplish this he returned for a year to Juniata College and completed his biology studies for medical school and thereafter obtained a scholarship at the University of Wisconsin, where he completed his degree in medical microbiology. He obtained his MS in 1953, and his PhD in 1955. Following that, he went to medical school at Baylor College of Medicine, in Houston. To support his family, he was an instructor in microbiology and did research in the microbiology department while attending medical school.[3]/nMeyers graduated medical school in 1959, and did his internship in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Then, with missionary medicine in mind, he worked in a hospital in Michigan, doing primarily surgery. He finished his surgical experience in the US around October 1961, and went to Africa, under the auspices of the American Leprosy Missions.[3][4]/nMeyers married Esther Kleinschmidt (a relative of Franz Heinrich Kleinschmidt) in August 1953. Esther's parents went to Africa in 1923, and she grew up in the Belgian Congo. Esther's father died in the Congo in 1964 and is buried in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. They had four children, Amy, George, Daniel, and Sara.[5]/nHe served in a one-doctor hospital in a remote area of Burundi near the Tanzania border. Burundi at that time was a country in turmoil because the Tutsi and the Hutu were at war with each other. There was rebellion. In fact, the prime minister had been assassinated no more than two days before Meyers' arrival in the capital city of Usumbura. Burundi was a protectorate under the Belgian government following the First World War and was still under Belgian rule when Meyers and his family arrived for work. There had also been three successive crop failures, and Burundi was dealing with a famine. Meyers did as much famine relief work as he did medicine. There were 600 patients in the leprosarium, and his hospital was the only one within about 50 kilometers. Thus, persons with all kinds of medical problems went to the little hospital. Leprosy was a major problem in Burundi. Estimates were then 5-10,000 leprosy patients among 3\u20134 million inhabitants.[3]/nMedications were limited, but sulfones were available, and he was able to provide treatment for a great many people, and care for the physical disabilities of most of the leprosy patients. The following year, 1962, he and his family moved to what was then Zaire (the Democratic Republic of the Congo), to work in Kivu in extreme eastern part of the country, near the base of the Ruwenzori Mountains. There was a tremendous opportunity for work among leprosy patients there. In Kivu, Meyers was in charge of a leprosarium with between 2,000 and 3,000 patients. At that time, leprosy patients were nearly all treated as in-patients.[3]/nThis was a dangerous time to be in the DRC; the land was in the early stages of the Congo Crisis. Joseph Mobutu had seized power in a military coup and soon arrested, tortured, and eventually had the elected Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba killed. Soon after Meyers and his family arrived a rebellion swept through their area. It began south, around Albertville, and swept north, eventually to involve nearly half the country, on a line diagonally drawn between the Ubangi and the Shaba area. The Leprosarium was right along the Uganda border. Because of health reasons for one of their daughters, Meyers and his wife, Esther left the little jungle hospital just a couple of months before the rebels arrived and were not captured, however, all of their belongings and personal effects were lost. They had hoped to return, but with the rebellion, it was impossible to enter at that time. So the American Leprosy Missions moved the family to the Bas-Congo (Lower Congo), about halfway between Matadi and Kinshasa.[3]/nThe hospital in the Bas-Congo, was much larger, about a 450-bed hospital, and they had many services and more physicians. So there was an opportunity to concentrate on leprosy. The medical missionaries developed a leprosy program that involved some 20 outlying centers. All leprosy patients were eventually discharged from the leprosarium, and seen and treated in these outlying centers, which Meyers visited regularly by Land Rover or by airplane. Meyers was also responsible for the dermatology at the hospital, and also for the laboratory and pathology.[3][6]  In addition to leprosy, Meyers encountered many other diseases including some which would later become part of his great life work, buruli ulcer and streptocerciasis./nMeyers and his family lived in the Bas-Congo from 1965 until 1973.  Though the HIV/AIDS epidemic was unknown to the world at that time, with current knowledge it appears that HIV/AIDS was already present in the area.  Meyers traveled extensively through the African region going to different mission stations, universities and other teaching centers in order to develop the leprosy service in the country. During these visits, especially those in the Stanleyville (Kisangani) area where AIDS may have arisen, Meyers and his colleagues saw patients whose symptoms fit the definition of AIDS and may well have been victims of that disease. It was established that some sera were taken by the Belgians as early as 1959 were positive for HIV.[3] Specifically, David Ho and colleagues from the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York told a conference that using that sera from 1959 they identified a case of HIV infection to a man living in what was then the Belgian Congo.[7]  This and other data demonstrate that HIV/AIDS existed in the Bas-Congo during the years that Meyers served in the region./nIn 1973 Meyers and his family moved to Hawaii.  He worked at the University of Hawaii as a professor of pathology for two years and became involved with the leprosy research on Molokai and also worked with leprosy patients, both on Oahu, at the Hale Mohalu Center in Pearl City, and on Molokai.[3]  While he was in Hawaii he was also able to spend some time organizing and analyzing the reports, documents, and tissue samples he had collected on leprosy patients from Africa and he used that knowledge to help his patients in Hawaii./nMeyers first visited the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) in 1961, before going to Africa. At that time, he met Daniel H. Connor, who was then planning to go to Uganda on a project which Chapman H. Binford (Chair of the Infectious Disease Department) and Robert E. Stowell (Scientific Director of the AFIP) had arranged.[8] They had made a trip to Africa a year or so previously and had arranged collaborative projects with two academic institutions in Africa: one at Onderstepoort, in Gauteng, South Africa, near Pretoria; and the other one in Kampala, Uganda at Makerere University. Meyers visited Connor when he was in Burundi in 1962, and from that time on collaborated with the AFIP. Meyers worked through Binford, sending specimens and studying special patients. When Connor returned to the AFIP, their collaboration increased.[3]/nMeyers and his colleagues obtained a significant grant from the Research and Development Command of the U.S. Army, and conducted research in sleeping sickness, trypanosomiasis, and Buruli ulcer during about five of his eight years at this post in the Lower Congo.  He worked in the Bas-Congo from 1965 until 1973.[3]/nAt the time of independence, in 1960, the Belgians had trypanosomiasis pretty well under control in what had been the Belgian Congo. When Meyers began working in the Bas-Congo in 1965, it was uncommon to see a patient with active trypanosomiasis. By the time he left there in 1973, he and other physicians were seeing hundreds of cases annually of African-type sleeping sickness caused by trypanosomes in the hospital. They would come in spontaneously; there was no survey work being done.[3]/nMeyers joined the staff at the AFIP in 1975 after returning from Africa and Hawaii. At the institute he followed the AFIP mission of providing Education, Consultation, and Research. Meyers helped Binford with the AFIP's Registry of Leprosy, which has material from between 30,000 and 40,000 cases of leprosy. This is probably largest collection of pathologic materials from leprosy patients anywhere in the world.  There was a lot of material on other mycobacterial diseases, such as Buruli ulcer, (Mycobacterium ulcerans infections) which is relatively unknown by the medical profession in the US, but it is a major problem in many foci in Africa and other places such as Australia.[3]/nIn addition his work at the AFIP included work on the World Health Organization WHO Center for the Study of Filariasis developed in the Infectious Disease department primarily by Binford, and filarial diseases was one of the major collaborative efforts between Meyers, Ronald C. Neafie, and Aileen M. Marty.[9]/nMeyers retired from the AFIP in 2005 but continued as visiting scientist until the AFIP was closed 2011. He died in Maryland in September 2018 at the age of 94.[10][2]/nAmong the many patients that Meyers helped at the Leprosarium were some with diseases that mimicked leprosy. A series of patients had hypopigmented areas of the skin that resembled tuberculoid leprosy, but did not have the loss of sensation associated with leprosy lesions. Meyers biopsied these and through his collaborations with the AFIP discovered the adult form of Mansonella streptocerca.[11][12]/nMeyers served as a chairman of the board of directors of American Leprosy Missions (ALM), Program Consultant to the ALM, and as a member of the ALM Board of Reference. He also served as Consultant to the Leonard Wood Memorial (American Leprosy Foundation). He was a member of the Corporate Board of the Damien-Dutton Society for Leprosy Aid. He served as a president of the International Leprosy Association, and also as president of the Binford-Dammin Society of Infectious Disease Pathologists.[13]/nIn the early 1990s Meyers began to focus more of his work on Mycobacterium ulcerans, the third most common mycobacterial infection of immunocompetent people, following tuberculosis and leprosy. This tiny bacterium produces a toxin that causes deep, rapidly developing ulcers of the skin and destroys the subcutaneous fat. It is primarily seen in children and is often devastating. This illness is most commonly called Buruli ulcer. Surgery is usually required and often causes extensive sequels. The best technique to treat patients with this disease is excision way beyond the ulcerated areas followed by a graft procedure. In 1992 Meyers traveled with Marty to West Africa to establish relations with local physicians and government health officials to learn more about the extent of the disease in that part of the world while also there to gather data on leprosy in non-human primates. He then worked closely with a Belgian scientist, Professor Fran\u00e7oise Portaels to further understand the pathogenesis of this terrible infectious disease. Together they published 56 major medical investigations on Buruli ulcer which led to major advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of this devastating neglected disease. Meyers remained active as a scientist and physician even in his final year of life, the last article he worked on with Portaels involving Buruli ulcer was published in January 2018.[14]", "65214898": "Yadvendradev Vikramsinh Jhala is an Indian scientist and conservationist who recently ended his tenure as the Dean at the Wildlife Institute of India in Dehradun./nJhala led a long-term research project on Asiatic lions.[1] Since 2002, Jhala has been working with National Tiger Conservation Authority Project Tiger, where he designed and led the implementation of national scale population assessments for tigers, other carnivores, ungulates and monitoring of habitats.[2][3] The last national assessment of 2018\u201319, where he led the implementation of scientific components, was accorded a status of the Guinness world record for the largest wildlife survey with camera traps.[4]/nHe recently retired as the Dean of the Wildlife Institute of India, in charge of the conservation initiatives of reintroducing the cheetah in India, and species recovery of the Great Indian Bustard in India./nJhala has worked with Rajesh Gopal and subsequent heads of Project Tiger.[5]/nHe teaches courses in quantitative ecology, population ecology, conservation biology, and field research techniques to Masters, Doctoral and Diploma students at the Wildlife Institute of India.[6]/nIn December 2022, Jhala was elected a fellow of the Indian National Science Academy[1]  (INSA).

Starting in 2008, he added special reports on greenhouse gas emissions and energy conservation.[4]/nMiller did not shy away from direct criticism of government decisions and longstanding abuses in law. An early example was his direct condemnation of SLAPP lawsuits for their negative effect on public advocacy. Miller's reports very strongly supported \"environmental activists\" who argued, \"the practice is widespread in the development industry and used to pacify activists and environmentalists\",[5][6] that is, silence them with fear of civil liability. Ontario passed an anti-SLAPP law in 2010./nIn 2013 Miller called to public attention the fact that Ontario\u2019s cabinet had allocated to itself, in the 2012 budget, the power to turn over public land to the exclusive control of private, multinational corporations. In a formal report Miller said that this, combined with cuts to staff and programs at Ministries of Natural Resources and the Environment, all \"quietly and without public consultation\", led to a situation with \"no rules\". Other actions were, Miller said, \"gutting\" protections for species at risk and that it was time for hydraulic fracturing regulation.[7]/nIn 2014 Miller warned that Ontario had done \"very little\" other than closing coal plants to meet its 2020 emissions targets, and had failed to build transit and other efficient infrastructure.[8]/nMiller's sharp turn on the Harris government ended a longstanding controversy.  Due to his two prior candidacies, Miller's initial appointment raised the perception by the NDP and Liberal caucuses that he was a Conservative partisan.  Opposition parties at Queen's Park accused the Harris government of using its majority to name a Conservative as Ontario's environment commissioner.[9] Miller was subsequently re-appointed twice by two successive parliaments headed by Liberal governments,[1] whom he sharply criticized./nMiller was, in addition to a former federal and provincial PC candidate, the president of the federal Conservative riding association in Nipissing, home riding of then-Premier Mike Harris.[9]/nOn May 19, 2015, Miller sought the Green Party of Canada nomination for the seat of Guelph in the upcoming Canadian federal election,[10] and on June 8, 2015, he was selected to run.[11][12]  He had gone to university there in 1977-79 and helped found the Ontario Public Interest Research Group in Guelph.[13]/nMiller had also previously run for provincial Progressive Conservatives in 1995 and in 1997 for Jean Charest's federal Progressive Conservatives.  He said the 2015 Conservative Party of Canada \"is not like and doesn't represent the points of view\" of those parties:[13] \"We thought we were uniting the right, instead we united the wrong\".[13]/nMiller was considered a star candidate by local media.

His observations and experiments also inspired the beginning of what is now known as the study of biological circadian rhythms. At the age of 92, de Mairan died of pneumonia in Paris on 20 February 1771./nDe Mairan attended college in Toulouse from 1694\u20131697 with a focus on ancient Greek.[1] In 1698 he went to Paris to study mathematics and physics under the teachings of Nicolas Malebranche.[1] In 1702, he returned home to B\u00e9ziers and began his lifelong study of several fields, most notably astronomy and plant rhythms.[1] Furthermore, during his time in B\u00e9ziers, he ate almost every day with the Bishop, Louis-Charles des Alrics du Rousset\u00a0[fr]. In 1723, de Mairan, who had become a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences, co-founded the Acad\u00e9mie de B\u00e9ziers under the protection of Cardinal de Fleury, acting prime minister of Louis XV (and himself a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of a former Bishop of B\u00e9ziers, Pierre de Bonsi).[1] \nEventually, de Mairan received official lodging in the Louvre where he remained pensionnaire until 1743 and served as secretary from 1741 to 1743.[1] In 1746, he was reinstated as pensionnaire g\u00e9om\u00e8tre, or full-time boarding surveyor. It is reported that the Prince of Conti and other great lords heaped extravagant gifts upon him. He was also secretary to the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans.[1]/nIn 1729, de Mairan performed an experiment that demonstrated the existence of circadian rhythms in plants, specifically the Mimosa pudica.[4] \nHe was intrigued by the daily opening and closing of the heliotrope plant and performed a simple experiment where he exposed the plants to constant darkness and recorded the behaviour.[5] De Mairan's key conclusion was that the daily rhythmic opening and closing of the leaves persisted even in the absence of sunlight.[5] However, de Mairan did not infer that heliotropes have internal clocks driving leaf rhythms, but rather that they were able \"to sense the Sun without ever seeing it\". The concept of an internal clock was actually not formulated until much later, although de Mairan did suggest that \"it would be curious to test [...] whether, using kilns heated to higher or lower temperatures, one could artificially recreate a day & night perceptible to [plants]; and whether in doing so one could reverse the \norder of the phenomena of true day & true night.\"[6]/nThese results may have gone unnoticed had his colleague, Jean Marchant,[7][8] not published them for de Mairan.[5] Alternatively, it may be that de Mairan simply was not available to present this work himself. It was quite common at the time, when travels were slow, for one scientist to present the work of another. Whatever the case, this rather obscure one-page contribution by a prolific and highly respected academician did stand the test of time. It is by far the most if not the only paper by de Mairan which is still quoted in the current scientific literature (bar purely historical reviews). When describing his work with eclosion rhythms in his Drosophila models or the rhythmic running activity of mice, founder of modern chronobiology, Colin Pittendrigh, recognised the work of Jean-Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan.[9]/nA video showing circadian rhythms in a cucumber plant in constant conditions, similar to what de Mairan observed, can be seen here on YouTube./nDespite Marchant's publication of de Mairan's work, which might have suggested the existence of endogenous biological clocks, rhythms in plant movements were for a long time thought to be extrinsically controlled, by light and dark cycles, or magnetic and temperature oscillations, or even a mysterious, yet-to-be identified X-factor.[10]/nIn 1823, almost a century after de Mairan's work, the Swiss botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle expanded on it by measuring the free running period of Mimosa pudica leaf movements in constant conditions, finding them to be 22\u201323 hours long. This was probably the first hint of what is now called the circadian (from Latin circa, about, and diem) nature of such endogenous rhythms, found in practically all living organisms, including some bacteria.[11]/nIn 1718, de Mairan was inducted into the Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences.[1] The Cardinal de Fleury and the Count of Maurepas selected Mairan to replace Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle as \"Secr\u00e9taire perp\u00e9tuel\" of the Acad\u00e9mie in 1740, a position he accepted only for 3 years, and thus duly resigned in 1743.[1] De Mairan also served as the Acad\u00e9mie's assistant director and later director intermittently between 1721 and 1760.[1] Eventually, de Mairan was appointed editor of the Journal des s\u00e7avans, a science periodical, by Chancellor d'Aguesseau.[1] Also, in 1735, de Mairan was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1769, a Foreign Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences as well as to the Russian Academy (St. Petersburg) in 1718.[1] De Mairan was also a member of the Royal Societies of London, Edinburgh, and Uppsala; the Institute of Bologna,[1] and the Academy of Rouen.[12] With Jean Bouillet and Antoine Portalon, he founded his own scientific society in his hometown of B\u00e9ziers, named the Acad\u00e9mie de B\u00e9ziers\u00a0[fr], around 1723.[1]/nBeyond astronomical and circadian observations, de Mairan actively worked in several other fields of physics including \"heat, light, sound, motion, the shape of the Earth, and the aurora\".[1]/nThe following is an abbreviated list of publications (with their English translations) organised by Dr. Robert A.

Because of the limitations placed on what scientists in her position in the pharmaceutical industry can say about their work, Odekunle had to develop a voice within the scientific community apart from speaking about things that are confidential. This led her to speaking out on racism in academia and science and to helping to encourage and make more visible those in science who are underrepresented. This she does on various social media platforms.[2] Some of her content, such as her episode on Henrietta Lacks on her YouTube channel has been shared with students at early as well as advanced levels of education.[6]/nI\u2019m now using [my] uniqueness to encourage up and coming scientists from diverse backgrounds to follow their passions even if the people who currently represent their fields don\u2019t look like them./nIn 2021, Odekunle was selected as a Rising Star Finalist in the Black British Business Awards' STEM category.[9]", "11213271": "Eva Engvall, born 1940, is one of the scientists who invented ELISA in 1971.[1] She is an elected fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science./nEva Engvall earned her PhD from the University of Stockholm in 1975.[2] Her postdoctoral work was done at the University of Helsinki and City of Hope National Medical Center in California, where she was subsequently appointed to staff.

She discovered the affinity of fibronectin to gelatin (denatured collagen),[11] demonstrating the potential of these two matrix components to form a complex in tissues. She also devised a simple, one-step purification of fibronectin by gelatin affinity chromatography that enabled many advances in fibronectin research.

His 1890 release of European starlings in Central Park resulted in the first successful starling nesting in North America to be observed by naturalists./nIn the decades after his death, Schiefflin was recast as being solely responsible for the introduction of starlings, and in 1948, Edwin Way Teale claimed (without evidence) that he had been motivated by a desire to introduce all of Shakespeare's birds to North America.[2]/nSchieffelin was born in New York City on January 29, 1827.[3] He was the seventh son of Henry Hamilton Schieffelin (1783\u20131865) and Maria Theresa (n\u00e9e Bradhurst) Schieffelin (1786\u20131872).[4] His father, a prominent lawyer, was named in honor of Governor Henry Hamilton for whom his grandfather Jacob Schieffelin served as secretary for during the American Revolutionary War.[5] Among his siblings was author Samuel Schieffelin,[6] and Bradhurst Schieffelin, a supporter of the People's Party.[7] The Schieffelin family was one of the oldest families in Manhattan.[8]/nSchieffelin belonged to the American Acclimatization Society, a group that aimed to help exchange plants and animals from one part of the world to another.[9] In the 19th century, such acclimatization societies were fashionable and supported by the scientific knowledge and beliefs of that era, as the effect that non-native species could have on the local ecosystem was not yet known./nIn 1890, Schieffelin released 60 imported starlings from England into New York City's Central Park.[10][11] He did the same with another 40 birds in 1891. According to an oft-repeated story, Schieffelin supposedly introduced starlings as part of a project to bring to the United States all the birds mentioned in the works of William Shakespeare.[12][13][14]\u00a0Some historians have cast doubt on this story, as no record of it exists until the 1940s.[15][16][2] He may have also been trying to control the same pests that had been annoying him thirty years earlier, when he sponsored the introduction of the house sparrow to North America.[17]/nSchieffelin's efforts were part of multiple releases of starlings in the United States, ranging from the mid-1870s through the mid-1890s.[2] The successful spread of starlings has come at the expense of many native birds that compete with the starling for nest holes in trees.[18] The starlings have also had negative impact on the US economy and ecosystem.[19] European starlings are now considered an invasive species in the United States.[20]/nHis attempts to introduce bullfinches, chaffinches, nightingales, and skylarks were not successful./nSchieffelin was married to Catherine Tonnel\u00e9 Hall (d. 1910). Catherine was a daughter of Valentine Gill Hall, an Irish immigrant, and Susan (n\u00e9e Tonnel\u00e9) Hall and the sister of Valentine Hall Jr., a banker and merchant who was the grandfather of Eleanor Roosevelt. Catherine's uncle was John Tonnel\u00e9 Jr., the farmer and politician who was a member of the New Jersey State Legislature.[21]/nSchieffelin died at the Hartshorn villa in Newport, Rhode Island on August 15, 1906.[1]", "19536399": "Tyrone B. Hayes (born July 29, 1967) is an American biologist and professor of integrative biology at the University of California, Berkeley. He is known for his research in frogs, concluding that the herbicide atrazine is an endocrine disruptor that demasculinizes male frogs,  causing them to display female characteristics. Hayes is an advocate for the critical review and regulation of pesticides as well as other chemicals that may cause adverse health effects. He has presented hundreds of papers, discussions, and seminars on his research's conclusion that environmental contaminants have played a major role in the global amphibian decline as well as being linked to the many health disparities that occur in minority and low income populations./nHayes' research into atrazine as an endocrine disruptor has been contested by Syngenta \u2013 the company who manufactures atrazine \u2013 and the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority./nIn 2023, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.[1][2]/nTyrone Hayes was born in 1967 in Columbia, South Carolina to Romeo and Susie Hayes. As a child he showed great interest in lizards and frogs. He was particularly interested in the way frogs morphed from tadpoles into their adult form.  He won a state science fair with research that showed that anole lizards had to be awake in order to change color.[3]  He graduated from Dreher High School in 1985 and earned both his B.A. and M.A. in biology in 1989 from Harvard University. His dissertation focused on the genetic and environmental mechanisms determining the gender of the wood frog. He continued his studies at the University of California, Berkeley. There he received his Ph.D. in integrative biology in 1993 for his study of the role that hormone play in mediating developmental responses to environmental changes in amphibians.[4]/nAfter graduating from Harvard University, Hayes worked as a technician and freelance consultant from 1990 to 1992 for Tiburon, California-based Biosystems, Inc.[5] Hayes has held an academic appointment (professorship) at the University of California, Berkeley since completing his doctoral research there in 1992;[3] he was hired as a graduate student instructor in 1992, became an assistant professor in 1994, associate professor in 2000, and professor in 2003 in the Department of Integrative Biology, Molecular Toxicology, Group in Endocrinology, Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, Energy and Resources Group, University of California, Berkeley.[5] In 2021, Hayes was appointed to the position of Department Co-Chair. He advanced to the position of associate dean for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in the College of Letters and Science at Berkeley in 2023.[1]/nHayes\u2019 scientific research has focused on the potential of genetic adaptation and the role of hormones in the development of the amphibian. His investigations have shown that chemical agents, such as a commonly used herbicide, have the ability to negatively impact the sexual development of the amphibian, even when such toxins are present in low concentrations. Hayes has taken an interest in the hormonal regulation and development of aggressive behavior. He has also been active with the National Science Foundation Review Panel since 1995, and he has served on several other advisory boards as well./nIn 1997, the consulting firm EcoRisk, Inc. paid Hayes to join a panel of experts conducting studies for the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis (later Syngenta) on the herbicide atrazine.[3][6] When Hayes' research found unexpected toxicities for atrazine, he reported them to the panel, however the panel and company were resistant to his findings. He wanted to repeat his work to validate it but Novartis refused funding for further research; he resigned from the panel and obtained other funding to repeat the experiments.[3][6]/nIn 2002 Hayes published findings that he says replicate what he found while he was working for EcoRisk,[3] that developing male African clawed frogs and leopard frogs exhibited female characteristics after exposure to atrazine, first in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)[7] and then in Nature.[8][9]/nIn 2007, Hayes was a co-author on a paper that detailed atrazine inducing mammary and prostate cancer in laboratory rodents and highlighted atrazine as a potential cause of reproductive cancers in humans.[10] In 2007, Hayes presented results of his studies to the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences showing chemical castration in frogs; individuals of both sexes had developed bisexual reproductive organs.[11]\nIn 2010, Hayes published research in PNAS[12] describing laboratory work showing how exposure to atrazine turned male tadpoles into females with impaired fertility.[6]/nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and its independent Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) examined all available studies on this topic and concluded that \"atrazine does not adversely affect amphibian gonadal development based on a review of laboratory and field studies.\".[13] The EPA and its SAP made recommendations concerning proper study design needed for further investigation into this issue. As required by the EPA, two experiments were conducted under Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) and inspection by the EPA and German regulatory authorities. The paper concluded \"These studies demonstrate that long-term exposure of larval X. laevis to atrazine at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 100 microg/l does not affect growth, larval development, or sexual differentiation.\"[14] A report written in Environmental Science and Technology (May 15, 2008) cites the independent work of researchers in Japan, who were unable to replicate Hayes' work. \"The scientists found no hermaphrodite frogs; no increase in aromatase as measured by aromatase mRNA induction; and no increase in vitellogenin, another marker of feminization.\"[15]\nIn 2010, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) responded to Hayes' 2010 published paper,[16] by stating that his findings \"do not provide sufficient evidence to justify a reconsideration of current regulations which are based on a very extensive dataset.\"[17]/nSince publishing his research on atrazine as an endocrine disruptor, Hayes has become an advocate for banning atrazine.[18]\nAccording to Hayes, the link between atrazine and altered \"aromatase and estrogen production has been demonstrated... in fish, frogs, alligators, birds, turtles, rats and human cells\", and, \"I believe that the preponderance of the evidence shows atrazine to be a risk to wildlife and humans. I would not want to be exposed to it, nor do I think it should be released into the environment.\"[18][19] He travels and lectures extensively to both scientific and lay audiences.[6]/nHe also has raised issues of environmental racism, warning that \"if you\u2019re black or Hispanic, you\u2019re more likely to live or work in areas where you\u2019re exposed to crap\".[6]  While a biologist on the Public Broadcasting Service, National Geographic program Strange Days, he expressed his concerns for human health, particularly that of minority and low-paid workers exposure to agricultural chemicals.[20]/nResearch published by Hayes and other scientists was used as evidence in a class action lawsuit against Syngenta by 15 water providers in Illinois that was settled for 105 million dollars in May 2012,[9][21][22] which reimbursed more than 1,000 water systems for the costs of filtering atrazine from drinking water, although the company denies any wrongdoing.[6][23]/nA long running conflict between Hayes and agricultural chemical manufacturer Syngenta was described as \"one of the weirdest feuds in the history of science,\u201d by Dashka Slater in her 2012 profile of Hayes in Mother Jones magazine.[3][24]/nIn 2014, New Yorker writer Rachel Aviv reported that Syngenta might have been orchestrating an attack not only on Hayes' scientific credibility, but on other scientists as well whose studies have shown atrazine to have adverse effects on the environment and/or human and animal health.[6]/nAviv reported that Syngenta had criticized Hayes' science and conduct in press releases, letters to the editor, and through a formal ethics complaint filed at University of California-Berkeley.[6] Internal Syngenta documents from 2005 released by a class-action lawsuit in 2014 show ways that Syngenta conspired to discredit Hayes, including attempting to get journals to retract his work, and investigating his funding and private life.[6][25][26]\nIn one of the 2005 e-mails obtained by class-action lawsuit plaintiffs, the company's communications consultants had written about plans to track Hayes' speaking engagements and prepare audiences with Syngenta's counterpoints to Hayes's message on atrazine. Syngenta subsequently stated that many of the documents unsealed in the lawsuits refer to \"ideas that were never implemented.\"[6]/nIn 2010, Syngenta forwarded an ethics complaint to the University of California Berkeley, complaining that Hayes had been sending sexually explicit and harassing e-mails to Syngenta scientists, including quoting the rapper DMX.[27] Some of these emails were obtained and published by Gawker.[28] Legal counsel from the university responded that Hayes had acknowledged sending letters having \"unprofessional and offensive\" content, and that he had agreed not to use similar language in future communications.[27][29] According to Hayes, the situation had escalated after Syngenta executive Tim Pastoor had threatened Hayes and his family.[30]/nHayes' work was featured in the 2008 documentary film Flow: For Love of Water.[31] In 2010, Hayes and filmmaker Penelope Jagessar Chaffer were featured on a TED Talk together for TEDWomen, discussing chemical exposure in pregnancy, in light of Jagessar's film: Toxic Baby.[32] He appeared in the 2012 documentary film Last Call at the Oasis.[33][34] Hayes is the subject of The Frog Scientist, a biographical book for children, first published in 2009.[35] Hayes appeared in another TED Talk in 2018. This talk centered around Hayes' early interest in science - particularly frogs - as well as his career development, research in endocrine disruption, his ongoing feud with Synenta, and the disproportionate way environmentally harmful chemicals affect the lives of minorities and the poor.[36]/nHayes lives in California with his wife, Kathy Kim. He has won several awards for his teaching and his research, including the Distinguished Teaching Award from University of California, Berkeley in 2002 and the President's Citation Award from the American Institute of Biological Science in 2004.

Working with Stanley Falkow at Stanford, she developed the strategy of using Mycobacterium marinum infection as a model for tuberculosis.[7][6] Her work has appeared in a number of journals, including Science,  Nature, and Cell.[2][8][4]  In 2018 and 2019 Ramakrishnan coauthored two influential papers[9] in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) arguing that the widely accepted estimates of the prevalence of latent tuberculosis\u2014estimates used as a basis for allocation of research funds\u2014are far too high.[10][11] She is married to Mark Troll, a physical chemist.[12][13][14]/nRamakrishnan was born in 1959 in Baroda (now Vadodara)[15] and grew up there.[16] Her parents were both scientists as is her brother, Nobel laureate Venki Ramakrishnan. When Ramakrishnan was a child, her mother had three bouts of spinal tuberculosis.[3]/nAs a high school student, Ramakrishnan excelled at math and physics.[3] Ramakrishnan began attending medical school at age 17, which is \"not atypical in India, where specialized training begins shortly after high school.\"[4] In 1983, she graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine degree in Vadodara[17] from Baroda Medical College.[18]/nAfter taking an elective course in advanced immunology, Ramakrishnan decided to study immunology. In 1990, she graduated from Tufts University with a PhD in Immunology.[17] She then became the first foreign graduate of the medical residency program at Tufts-New England Medical Center.[4] After completing a fellowship in Infectious Diseases at the University of California at San Francisco hospitals, including San Francisco General Hospital (now Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center),[19] Ramakrishnan completed postdoctoral work in Stanley Falkow's lab at Stanford University, where she developed the strategy of using Mycobacterium marinum infection in zebrafish as a model for tuberculosis.[6]/nIn 2001, Ramakrishnan joined the faculty of the University of Washington,[6] where she worked both as a basic scientist and infectious diseases physician. While at the University of Washington, she pioneered the study of tuberculosis in zebrafish as a close approximation to tuberculosis in humans.  This strategy led to a fundamental new biological understanding of how disease develops.  Zebrafish larvae are optically transparent and lend themselves to genetic manipulation; by infecting them with their natural pathogen, Mycobacterium marinum, a bacterium that causes tuberculosis in fish and is a close genetic relative of the bacteria that cause tuberculosis in humans, she could carefully track the infection while manipulating the genes of both the larvae and the bacteria.  This approach \"enabled a detailed dissection of granuloma formation\"[6] (a granuloma is a structure of the immune system made up principally of cells, called macrophages, that ingest bacteria and other foreign particles). In 2010, Ramakrishnan was the senior author of a study which was published as the cover story of Cell.[20]/nIn 2014, Ramakrishnan joined the faculty of the University of Cambridge as a principal research fellow for the Wellcome Trust and Professor of Immunology and Infectious Diseases. Work in Seattle, and subsequently in Cambridge, led to the discovery of the molecular and cellular details of mycobacterial and host interactions at each step of infection. This yielded fundamental insights that suggest entirely new approaches to treat tuberculosis. Ramakrishnan and her research group showed that two lipids (a type of fatty molecule) on the surface of the mycobacteria work together to enable the bacteria to initially avoid the macrophages that would kill them and instead enter macrophages that provide them a niche for growth.[21] She found that the bacteria then stimulate the formation of granulomas that provide them a safe harbour, in contrast to the normal role of granulomas in protecting the host from the bacteria.[22] Later the infected macrophages in the granulomas die, and this accelerates bacterial growth and promotes the development of the disease.[23][24][25][26] These findings led to host-targeting therapies that show promise in tuberculosis patients.  Ramakrishnan and her group tackled the problem of drug tolerance in tuberculosis, and found a drug that inhibits the development of resistance to the standard drugs used to treat the disease.[27]/nRamakrishnan later exploited the zebrafish to study leprosy, another devastating disease with morbid neurological consequences. She showed that a Mycobacterium leprae lipid causes nerve damage by inciting abnormal responses in the macrophages.[28]/nIn addition to basic science investigations, Ramakrishnan, along with Marcel Behr and Paul Edelstein, reviewed studies concerning the concept of latent tuberculosis in order to determine whether tuberculosis-infected persons have life-long infection capable of causing disease at any future time. These studies, both published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), show that the incubation period of tuberculosis is short, usually within months after infection, and very rarely more than 2 years after infection.[29] They also show that more than 90% of people infected with M. tuberculosis for more than two years never develop tuberculosis even if their immune system is severely suppressed.[11] Immunologic tests for tuberculosis infection such as the tuberculin skin test and interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) only indicate past infection, with the majority of previously infected persons no longer capable of developing tuberculosis. Ramakrishnan told the New York Times that researchers \"have spent hundreds of millions of dollars chasing after latency, but the whole idea that a quarter of the world is infected with TB is based on a fundamental misunderstanding.\"[9]/nThe first BMJ article about latency was accompanied by an editorial written by Soumya Swaminathan, Deputy Director-General of the World Health Organization, who endorsed the findings and called for more funding of TB research directed at the most heavily afflicted parts of the world, rather than disproportionate attention to a relatively minor problem that affects just the wealthy countries.[9]\nEarlier researchers had warned of a \"ticking time bomb\" of TB cases in the US and other wealthy countries that should be a focus of attention.[30] The work of Ramakrishnan and her coauthors cast doubt on this warning./nRamakrishnan was elected a Member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2015[18] of the United States.[31] She has received a number of other awards, including a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director's Pioneer Award and a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Investigators in the Pathogenesis of Infectious Disease Award.[4] She also served on the Life Sciences jury for the Infosys Prize in 2016.

She is a Professor of Cellular and Molecular Medicine and Cell and Developmental Biology at the University of California, San Diego and an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.  She is known for her contributions to our understanding of how dynein, an exceptionally large motor protein that moves many intracellular cargos,[1] works and is regulated. She developed one of the first systems to produce recombinant dynein[2] and discovered that, unlike other cytoskeletal motors, dynein can take a wide variety of step sizes, forward and back and even sideways.[2][3] She lives in San Diego, California./nReck-Peterson was educated at Litchfield High School in Litchfield, Minnesota, where she served as senior class president and graduated as salutatorian in 1989.  She was an all-state track and cross-country runner and team captain.[4] She was inducted into the Litchfield High School Hall of Fame in 2017.[4]/nReck-Peterson became interested in molecular motors when she took the Physiology Course at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. She chose the motor protein myosin as the topic of her Ph.D. work in the laboratories of Mark Mooseker and Peter Novick at Yale University. Her work focused on the class V myosins, which have multiple functions in the cell ranging from mRNA transport to cell polarity and membrane trafficking.[5] She developed a modified in vitro motility assay to show that both Myo2p and Myo4p class V myosins in yeast appear to be non-processive motors in the absence of additional regulation, unlike their vertebrate counterparts.[6]/nIn 2001, Reck-Peterson moved to UCSF to pursue post-doctoral studies with Ronald Vale. She began to work on dynein, a molecular motor that transports cargoes such as proteins, organelles and messenger RNAs to locations where they are needed in the cell.  Dynein uses the energy stored in ATP to move towards the \"minus end\" of microtubules.  Defects in dyneins and their regulatory proteins lead to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, showing the importance of microtubule-based transport in long cells such as neurons.[7] Reck-Peterson used single-molecule techniques to examine the stepping behavior of dynein, finding that isolated dynein can step forwards, backwards and even sideways.[2]/nIn 2007, Reck-Peterson joined the Department of Cell Biology at Harvard Medical School as an assistant professor. She continued to study the mechanism of dynein-mediated transport.[8]  Using DNA origami, she created artificial cargos that could be programmed to load onto multiple types of motors, and used these to create competition, or a \"tug of war\", between motors.[9] She used an assay for long-distance microtubule-based transport in the long, highly polarized hyphae of Aspergillus nidulans[10] to show that Lis-1 is an initiation factor for dynein-mediated transport,[11] and to show that some cargos of microtubule-based motors hitchhike on others.[12] Mutants in the gene encoding Lis-1 are one cause of lissencephaly, a severe brain disorder.  In collaboration with Andres Leschziner, she showed that Lis-1 regulates the interaction between dynein and the microtubule in two different ways,[13][14] and determined the structural basis for the switch between microtubule binding and microtubule release.[15]/nIn 2015 Reck-Peterson moved to the University of California, San Diego,[16] and in 2018 she became an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.[17]", "2169417": "Walter Maurice Elsasser (March 20, 1904 \u2013 October 14, 1991) was a German-born American physicist, a developer of the presently accepted dynamo theory as an explanation of the Earth's magnetism.  He proposed that this magnetic field resulted from electric currents induced in the fluid outer core of the Earth.  He revealed the history of the Earth's magnetic field by the study of the magnetic orientation of minerals in rocks.[1] He was also the first to suggest that the wave-like nature of matter might be investigated by electron scattering experiments using crystalline solids./nThe Olin Hall at the Johns Hopkins University has a Walter Elsasser Memorial in the lobby./nElsasser was born in 1904 to a Jewish family[2] in Mannheim, Germany.  Before he became known for his geodynamo theory, while in G\u00f6ttingen during the 1920s, he had suggested the experiment to test the wave aspect of electrons. This suggestion of Elsasser was later communicated by his senior colleague from G\u00f6ttingen (Nobel Prize recipient Max Born) to physicists in England. This explained the results of the Davisson-Germer and Thomson experiments later awarded with the Nobel Prize in Physics.  In 1935, while working in Paris, Elsasser calculated the binding energies of protons and neutrons in heavy radioactive nuclei.  Wigner, Jensen and Goeppert-Mayer received the Nobel in 1963 for work developing out of Elsasser's initial formulation.  Elsasser therefore came quite close to a Nobel prize on two occasions./nDuring 1946\u201347, Elsasser published papers describing the first mathematical model for the origin of the Earth's magnetic field. He conjectured that it could be a self-sustaining dynamo, powered by convection in the liquid outer core, and described a possible feedback mechanism between flows having two different geometries, toroidal and poloidal (indeed, inventing the terms). This had been developed from about 1941 onwards, partly in his spare time during his scientific war service with the U.S. Army Signal Corps.[3]/nDuring his later years, Elsasser became interested in what is now called systems biology and contributed a series of articles to Journal of Theoretical Biology.[4][5][6][7][8][9][10] The final version of his thoughts on this subject can be found in his book Reflections on a Theory of Organisms, published in 1987 and again posthumously with a new foreword by Harry Rubin in 1998./nElsasser died in 1991 in Baltimore, Maryland, US./nA biotonic law, a phrase invented by Elsasser, is a principle of nature which is not contained in the principles of physics.[11]/nBiotonic laws may also be considered as local instances of global organismic or organismal principles,[12][13] such as the Organismic Principle of Natural Selection.[14][15]/nSome, but not all, of Elsasser's theoretical biology work is still quite controversial, and in fact may disagree with several of the basic tenets of current systems biology that he may have helped to develop.  Basic to Elsasser's biological thought is the notion of the great complexity of the cell.  Elsasser deduced from this that any investigation of a causative chain of events in a biological system will reach a \"terminal point\", where the number of possible inputs into the chain will overwhelm the capacity of the scientist to make predictions, even with the most powerful computers.  This might seem like a counsel of despair, but in fact Elsasser was not suggesting the abandonment of biology as a worthwhile research topic, but rather for a different kind of biology such that molecular causal chains are no longer the main focus of study.  Correlation between supra-molecular events would become the main data source. Moreover, the heterogeneity of logical classes encompassed by all biological organisms without exception\nis an important part of Elsasser's legacy to both Complex systems biology and Relational Biology.[16]/nElsasser was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1957. From the American Geophysical Union he received the William Bowie Medal, its highest honor, in 1959; and the John Adam Fleming Medal (for contributions to geomagnetism) in 1971.[17][18] He received the Penrose Medal from the Geological Society of America in 1979 and the Gauss Medal from Germany in 1977.[3][19] In 1987, he was awarded the USA's National Medal of Science \"for his fundamental and lasting contributions to physics, meteorology, and geophysics in establishing quantum mechanics, atmospheric radiation transfer, planetary magnetism and plate tectonics.\"[20]", "51583562": "Avigad Vonshak is a Professor Emeritus at the French Associates Institute for Agriculture and Biotechnology of Drylands at the Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel./nVonshak was born in Germany in 1947 and immigrated to Israel with his parents in 1948.

His findings point out that in many cases the system is down regulated or even photoinhibited not necessarily because of exposure to high light intensity but rather due to other environmental stress that reduce the photosynthetic activity be it temperature or salinity. As a result, the ability of the cells to utilize light by the photosynthetic machinery is reduced and thus light levels that are considered as harmless under optimal growth conditions are turning to be over-saturating levels and result in down regulating and photoinhibiting the photosynthetic apparatus..", "59742805": "Naomi Cappuccino is an associate professor of biology at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada.

In 1988, Huntress moved to NASA headquarters, where he would serve in several positions, including Director of NASA's Solar System Exploration Division and Associate Administrator for Space Science./nAs a part of these positions, Huntress oversaw all NASA research missions to the planets and asteroids of the Solar System, including missions to Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn. Following his work with NASA, he became the director of the Geophysical Laboratory at the Carnegie Institution, and the president of The Planetary Society. He has also worked on the NASA Advisory Council, and is a public advocate for space exploration./nWesley Huntress was interested in space exploration from a young age, describing himself as a \"Sputnik kid\" who entered the sciences in college out of an interest in joining the space race between the US and USSR.[1] Huntress was awarded a B.S. in chemistry from Brown University in 1964 and a Ph.D. in chemical physics from Stanford University in 1968. Following his degrees, he began a career as an astrochemist and space scientist[2] Brown University would later bestow an honorary doctoral of sciences degree upon Huntress as well, during its 2005 convocation ceremonies.[3]/nHuntress spent much of his career at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, also teaching as a professor at the associated California Institute of Technology. He started at the lab following his PhD as a National Research Council Resident Associate, and joined the lab full-time in 1969 \"as a research scientist specializing in ion chemistry and planetary atmospheres\" according to NASA. His work there included research into the chemical evolution in interstellar clouds, comets and planetary atmospheres. His positions at the lab included those as \"co-investigator for the Ion Mass Spectrometer experiment in the Giotto Halley's Comet mission, as the Coma Interdisciplinary Scientist for the Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby mission, and as JPL Study Scientist for the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite and Cassini missions\".[4] He was also a part of the research into molecule formation on Titan, research that was published in 1981 by Nature,[5] as well as ion cyclotron resonance and ion-molecule reactions in off-Earth environments.[6][7]/nDuring the 1980s, Huntress was a game programmer for the Apple II computer, creating space flight simulators. They were published through Sublogic (Saturn Navigator), Edu-Ware (Rendezvous: A Space Shuttle Flight Simulation),[8] and Electric Transit. In 1984 he then co-directed the game Wilderness: A Survival Adventure with Charles Kohlhase, a first-person computer game where you are the survivor of a plane crash and have to cross the Sierra Mountains to find a remote ranger's station in order to continue surviving. In 1986, Huntress was a producer on the computer game Lunar Explorer.[9][10][11]/nHuntress was promoted from the Laboratory to NASA Headquarters in the late 1980s. He first worked as Special Assistant to the Director of Earth Science and Applications,[12] and then served as the Director of NASA's Solar System Exploration Division.[13] Upon taking the position, he became an advocate for reforming the Discovery Program for low-cost planetary exploration missions, to make it more cost-effective, including the opening of proposals from private companies to participate in the running of the program, creating a public-private partnership for Solar System exploration.[14] As director, Huntress served as the overseer and spokesperson for the development of NASA's missions to Mars that would take place over the 1990s,[15] and the results of the Magellan probe mission to Venus as well as the Galileo mission to Jupiter.[16][17] He also founded the NASA Astrobiology program.[18]/nHuntress was promoted to NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Science in 1993. As Associate Administrator, Huntress was in charge of all of NASA's space science programs.[19] Huntress worked within the agency, with White House and Congress, and as spokesperson for the press. Projects for which Huntress was responsible for included the Mars missions he had helped to develop in his prior positions, as well as the Cassini\u2013Huygens mission to Saturn.[20][21][22][23] He remained in the position until 1998, whereupon he was the recipient of the 1998 Carl Sagan Memorial Award.[2] Over his tenure, Huntress was also awarded the US Presidential Distinguished Executive Award, the NASA Robert H.

According to the Washington Times, those challenges were: \"(1) To seek evidence of life elsewhere in the solar system where liquid water existed in the past or exists now. (2) To study planets around other stars (the Sun being the star of our planetary system). (3) To send a spacecraft to a nearby star, something we don't know how to do today - \"but in 1900 we didn't know how to fly either.\" (4) To develop a plan of human exploration beyond Earth orbit.\"[27]/nFollowing his time at NASA, Huntress became the director of the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Geophysical Laboratory in the fall of 1998, and remained in this position until his retirement in 2008.[18][19] His role there continued to be strategizing and lobbying for space exploration. In 2004 he was head on a report, \"The Next Steps In Exploring Deep Space\", which proposed a vision for a \"stepping stone\" approach for incremental exploration of space by humans using the Moon, Lagrange Points, Near-Earth Objects, and Mars.[28] His research has included the evolution of interstellar medium, and pre-biotic organic chemistry on early Earth.[18] He is now Director Emeritus of the Geophysical Laboratory. While at Carnegie, he also served as the president of The Planetary Society from 2001 to 2006, having served as the society's vice-president in 2000.

For example, Huntress opined on the International Space Station, stating that, \"I don't place the space station in the critical path for sending humans to the moon ... And frankly the science community will tell you it was never a very useful platform for doing science at all. It's not in the right orbit for lots of things, and it's a very noisy environment.\"[30] As a result of his views, he was asked by then-administrator Michael D. Griffin to resign his position with the council in August 2006.[31] On November 2, 2009, Huntress returned to the Council, and was named by administrator Charles Bolden as chair of the NASA Advisory Council's Science Committee.[32]/nIn 2011, Huntress coauthored the book Soviet Robots in the Solar System: Mission Technologies and Discoveries with Soviet space scientist Mikhail Ya Marov.[33]", "7838362": "George J.

His best known scientific contribution is his research on the possibility of extraterrestrial life, including experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from basic chemicals by exposure to light. He assembled the first physical messages sent into space, the Pioneer plaque and the Voyager Golden Record, which were universal messages that could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence that might find them. He argued in favor of the hypothesis, which has since been accepted, that the high surface temperatures of Venus are the result of the greenhouse effect.[4]/nInitially an assistant professor at Harvard, Sagan later moved to Cornell, where he spent most of his career. He published more than 600 scientific papers and articles and was author, co-author or editor of more than 20 books.[5] He wrote many popular science books, such as The Dragons of Eden, Broca's Brain, Pale Blue Dot and The Demon-Haunted World. He also co-wrote and narrated the award-winning 1980 television series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, which became the most widely watched series in the history of American public television: Cosmos has been seen by at least 500 million people in 60 countries.[6] A book, also called Cosmos, was published to accompany the series. Sagan also wrote a science-fiction novel, published in 1985, called Contact, which became the basis for a 1997 film of the same name. His papers, comprising 595,000 items,[7] are archived in the Library of Congress.[8]/nSagan was a popular public advocate of skeptical scientific inquiry and the scientific method; he pioneered the field of exobiology and promoted the search for extra-terrestrial intelligent life (SETI). He spent most of his career as a professor of astronomy at Cornell University, where he directed the Laboratory for Planetary Studies. Sagan and his works received numerous awards and honors, including the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal, the National Academy of Sciences Public Welfare Medal, the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction (for his book The Dragons of Eden), and (for Cosmos: A Personal Voyage), two Emmy Awards, the Peabody Award, and the Hugo Award. He married three times and had five children. After developing myelodysplasia, Sagan died of pneumonia at the age of 62 on December 20, 1996./nCarl Edward Sagan was born in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of New York City's Brooklyn borough on November 9, 1934.[9][10] His mother, Rachel Molly Gruber, was a housewife from New York City; his father, Samuel Sagan, was a Ukrainian garment worker who emigrated from Kamianets-Podilskyi (which was then in the Russian Empire).[11] Sagan was named in honor of his maternal grandmother, Chaiya Clara, who had died while giving birth to her second child; she was, in Sagan's words, \"the mother she [Rachel] never knew.\"[12] Sagan's maternal grandfather later married a woman named Rose, whom Sagan's sister Carol would later say was \"never accepted\" as Rachel's mother because Rachel \"knew she [Rose] wasn't her birth mother.\"[13] Sagan's family lived in a modest apartment in Bensonhurst. He later discussed his family being Reform Jews, the most liberal of Judaism's four main branches. He and his sister agreed that their father was not especially religious, but that their mother \"definitely believed in God, and was active in the temple [...] and served only kosher meat.\"[14] During the worst years of the Depression, his father worked as a movie theater usher.[14]/nAccording to biographer Keay Davidson, Sagan experienced a kind of \"inner war\" as a result of his close relationship with both of his parents, who were in many ways \"opposites.\" He traced his later analytical urges to his mother, a woman who had been extremely poor as a child in New York City during World War I and the 1920s.[15] As a young woman, she had had intellectual ambitions, but they were sabotaged by her poverty, her status as a woman and a wife, and her Jewish ethnicity. Davidson suggested that this is why she \"worshipped her only son, Carl\" because \"he would fulfill her unfulfilled dreams.\"[15] Sagan believed that he got his sense of wonder from his father, who spent his free time giving apples to the poor or helping soothing tensions between employees and management within New York City's garment industry.[15] Although awed by his son's intellectual abilities, Sagan's father took his inquisitiveness in stride and saw it as part of growing up.[15] Later, during his career, Sagan would draw on his childhood memories to illustrate scientific points as he did in his book Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors.[16]/nDescribing his parents' influence on his later thinking, Sagan said: \"My parents were not scientists. They knew almost nothing about science. But in introducing me simultaneously to skepticism and to wonder, they taught me the two uneasily cohabiting modes of thought that are central to the scientific method.\"[17] He recalled that a defining moment in his development was at age four, when his parents took him to see the exhibits at the 1939 New York World's Fair. He later described his memories of several exhibits there. One was a moving map in the America of Tomorrow exhibit, which he said \"showed beautiful highways and cloverleaves and little General Motors cars all carrying people to skyscrapers, buildings with lovely spires, flying buttresses\u2014and it looked great!\"[18] Another was a flashlight shining on a photoelectric cell, which created a crackling sound, and another showed how the sound from a tuning fork became a wave on an oscilloscope. He also saw an exhibit of the then-nascent medium known as television. Referring to that exhibit, he later wrote: \"Plainly, the world held wonders of a kind I had never guessed. How could a tone become a picture and light become a noise?\"[18]/nSagan also saw one of the Fair's most publicized events: the burial of a time capsule at Flushing Meadows, which contained mementos of the 1930s to be recovered by Earth's descendants in a future millennium. Davidson wrote that this \"thrilled Carl.\" As an adult, inspired by his memories of the World's Fair, Sagan and his colleagues would create similar time capsules to be sent out into the galaxy: the Pioneer plaque and the Voyager Golden Record pr\u00e9cis.[19] During World War\u00a0II, Sagan's family worried about the fate of their European relatives. Sagan, however, was generally unaware of the details of the ongoing war. He wrote, \"Sure, we had relatives who were caught up in the Holocaust. Hitler was not a popular fellow in our household... but on the other hand, I was fairly insulated from the horrors of the war.\" His sister, Carol, said that their mother \"above all wanted to protect Carl... she had an extraordinarily difficult time dealing with World War\u00a0II and the Holocaust.\"[19] Sagan's book The Demon-Haunted World (1996) included his memories of this conflicted period, when his family dealt with the realities of the war in Europe but tried to prevent it from undermining his optimistic spirit.[17]/nSoon after entering elementary school, Sagan began to express a strong inquisitiveness about nature. He recalled taking his first trips to the public library alone, at the age of five, when his mother got him a library card. He wanted to learn what stars were, since none of his friends or their parents could give him a clear answer: \"I went to the librarian and asked for a book about stars [...] and the answer was stunning. It was that the Sun was a star but really close. The stars were suns, but so far away they were just little points of light. The scale of the universe suddenly opened up to me. It was a kind of religious experience. There was a magnificence to it, a grandeur, a scale which has never left me. Never ever left me.\"[20] At about age six or seven, he and a close friend took trips to the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. While there, they went to the Hayden Planetarium and walked around the museum's exhibits of space objects, such as meteorites, and displays of dinosaurs and animals in natural settings. He wrote, \"I was transfixed by the dioramas\u2014lifelike representations of animals and their habitats all over the world. Penguins on the dimly lit Antarctic ice [...] a family of gorillas, the male beating his chest [...] an American grizzly bear standing on his hind legs, ten or twelve feet tall, and staring me right in the eye.\"[20]/nSagan's parents helped nurture his growing interest in science by buying him chemistry sets and reading materials. However, his interest in space was his primary focus, especially after reading sci-fi stories by writers such as H. G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs, which stirred his imagination about the possibility of life on other planets such as Mars.[21] According to biographer Ray Spangenburg, Sagan's early years of trying to understand the mysteries of the planets became a \"driving force in his life, a continual spark to his intellect, and a quest that would never be forgotten.\"[17] In 1947, Sagan discovered the magazine Astounding Science Fiction, which introduced him to more hard science fiction speculations than those in Burroughs' novels.[21] That same year, a mass hysteria developed about the possibility that extraterrestrial visitors had arrived in flying saucers, and the young Sagan joined in the speculation that the flying \"discs\" people reported seeing in the sky might be alien spaceships.[22]/nSagan attended David A. Boody Junior High School in his native Bensonhurst and had his bar mitzvah when he turned 13.[23] In 1948, when he was 14, his father's work took the family to the older semi-industrial town of Rahway, New Jersey, where he attended Rahway High School.[23] He was a straight-A student but was bored because his classes did not challenge him and his teachers did not inspire him.[23] His teachers realized this and tried to convince his parents to send him to a private school, with an administrator telling them, \"This kid ought to go to a school for gifted children, he has something really remarkable.\"[24] However, his parents could not afford to do so. Sagan became president of the school's chemistry club, and set up his own laboratory at home. He taught himself about molecules by making cardboard cutouts to help him visualize how they were formed: \"I found that about as interesting as doing [chemical] experiments.\"[24] He was mostly interested in astronomy, learning about it in his spare time. In his junior year of high school, he discovered that professional astronomers were paid for doing something he always enjoyed, and decided on astronomy as a career goal: \"That was a splendid day\u2014when I began to suspect that if I tried hard I could do astronomy full-time, not just part-time.\"[25] Sagan graduated from Rahway High School in 1951.[23]/nBefore the end of high school, Sagan entered an essay writing contest in which he explored the idea that human contact with advanced life forms from another planet might be as disastrous for people on Earth as Native Americans' first contact with Europeans had been for Native Americans.[26] The subject was considered controversial, but his rhetorical skill won over the judges and they awarded him first prize.[26] When he was about to graduate from high school, his classmates voted him \"most likely to succeed\" and put him in line to be valedictorian.[26] He attended the University of Chicago because, despite his excellent high school grades, it was one of the very few colleges he had applied to that would consider accepting a 16-year-old. Its chancellor, Robert Maynard Hutchins, had recently retooled the undergraduate College of the University of Chicago into an \"ideal meritocracy\" built on Great Books, Socratic dialogue, comprehensive examinations, and early entrance to college with no age requirement.[27]/nAs an honors-program undergraduate, Sagan worked in the laboratory of geneticist H. J. Muller and wrote a thesis on the origins of life with physical chemist Harold Urey. He also joined the Ryerson Astronomical Society.[28] In 1954, he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts with general and special honors[29] in what he quipped was \"nothing.\"[30] In 1955, he earned a Bachelor of Science in physics. He went on to do graduate work at the University of Chicago, earning a Master of Science in physics in 1956 and a Doctor of Philosophy in astronomy and astrophysics in 1960. His doctoral thesis, submitted to the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, was entitled Physical Studies of the Planets.[31][32][33][34] During his graduate studies, he used the summer months to work with planetary scientist Gerard Kuiper, who was his dissertation director,[3] as well as physicist George Gamow and chemist Melvin Calvin. The title of Sagan's dissertation reflected interests he had in common with Kuiper, who had been president of the International Astronomical Union's commission on \"Physical Studies of Planets and Satellites\" throughout the 1950s.[35]/nIn 1958, Sagan and Kuiper worked on the classified military Project A119, a secret U.S. Air Force plan to detonate a nuclear warhead on the Moon and document its effects.[36] Sagan had a Top Secret clearance at the Air Force and a Secret clearance with NASA.[37] In 1999, an article published in the journal Nature revealed that Sagan had included the classified titles of two Project A119 papers in his 1959 application for a scholarship to University of California, Berkeley. A follow-up letter to the journal by project leader Leonard Reiffel confirmed Sagan's security leak.[38]/nFrom 1960 to 1962 Sagan was a Miller Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley.[39] Meanwhile, he published an article in 1961 in the journal Science on the atmosphere of Venus, while also working with NASA's Mariner 2 team, and served as a \"Planetary Sciences Consultant\" to the RAND Corporation.[40]/nAfter the publication of Sagan's Science article, in 1961 Harvard University astronomers Fred Whipple and Donald Menzel offered Sagan the opportunity to give a colloquium at Harvard and subsequently offered him a lecturer position at the institution. Sagan instead asked to be made an assistant professor, and eventually Whipple and Menzel were able to convince Harvard to offer Sagan the assistant professor position he requested.[40] Sagan lectured, performed research, and advised graduate students at the institution from 1963 until 1968, as well as working at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, also located in Cambridge, Massachusetts./nIn 1968, Sagan was denied academic tenure at Harvard. He later indicated that the decision was very unexpected.[41] The denial has been blamed on several factors, including that he focused his interests too broadly across a number of areas (while the norm in academia is to become a renowned expert in a narrow specialty), and perhaps because of his well-publicized scientific advocacy, which some scientists perceived as borrowing the ideas of others for little more than self-promotion.[37] An advisor from his years as an undergraduate student, Harold Urey, wrote a letter to the tenure committee recommending strongly against tenure for Sagan.[22]/nScience is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time\u00a0\u2013 when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness... The dumbing down of America is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30 second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance./nCarl Sagan, from Demon-Haunted World (1995)[42]/nLong before the ill-fated tenure process, Cornell University astronomer Thomas Gold had courted Sagan to move to Ithaca, New York, and join the recently-hired astronomer Frank Drake amongst the faculty at Cornell. Following the denial of tenure from Harvard, Sagan accepted Gold's offer and remained a faculty member at Cornell for nearly 30 years until his death in 1996. Unlike Harvard, the smaller and more laid-back astronomy department at Cornell welcomed Sagan's growing celebrity status.[43] Following two years as an associate professor, Sagan became a full professor at Cornell in 1970 and directed the Laboratory for Planetary Studies there. From 1972 to 1981, he was associate director of the Center for Radiophysics and Space Research (CRSR) at Cornell. In 1976, he became the David Duncan Professor of Astronomy and Space Sciences, a position he held for the remainder of his life.[44]/nSagan was associated with the U.S. space program from its inception.[citation needed] From the 1950s onward, he worked as an advisor to NASA, where one of his duties included briefing the Apollo astronauts before their flights to the Moon. Sagan contributed to many of the robotic spacecraft missions that explored the Solar System, arranging experiments on many of the expeditions. Sagan assembled the first physical message that was sent into space: a gold-plated plaque, attached to the space probe Pioneer\u00a010, launched in 1972. Pioneer\u00a011, also carrying another copy of the plaque, was launched the following year. He continued to refine his designs; the most elaborate message he helped to develop and assemble was the Voyager Golden Record, which was sent out with the Voyager space probes in 1977. Sagan often challenged the decisions to fund the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station at the expense of further robotic missions.[45]/nFormer student David Morrison described Sagan as \"an 'idea person' and a master of intuitive physical arguments and 'back of the envelope' calculations\",[37] and Gerard Kuiper said that \"Some persons work best in specializing on a major program in the laboratory; others are best in liaison between sciences. Dr. Sagan belongs in the latter group.\"[37]/nSagan's contributions were central to the discovery of the high surface temperatures of the planet Venus.[4][46] In the early 1960s no one knew for certain the basic conditions of Venus' surface, and Sagan listed the possibilities in a report later depicted for popularization in a Time Life book Planets. His own view was that Venus was dry and very hot as opposed to the balmy paradise others had imagined. He had investigated radio waves from Venus and concluded that there was a surface temperature of 500\u00a0\u00b0C (900\u00a0\u00b0F). As a visiting scientist to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, he contributed to the first Mariner missions to Venus, working on the design and management of the project. Mariner 2 confirmed his conclusions on the surface conditions of Venus in 1962./nSagan was among[clarification needed] the first to hypothesize that Saturn's moon Titan might possess oceans of liquid compounds on its surface and that Jupiter's moon Europa might possess subsurface oceans of water. This would make Europa potentially habitable.[47] Europa's subsurface ocean of water was later indirectly confirmed by the spacecraft Galileo. The mystery of Titan's reddish haze was also solved with Sagan's help. The reddish haze was revealed to be due to complex organic molecules constantly raining down onto Titan's surface.[48]/nSagan further contributed insights regarding the atmospheres of Venus and Jupiter, as well as seasonal changes on Mars. He also perceived global warming as a growing, man-made danger and likened it to the natural development of Venus into a hot, life-hostile planet through a kind of runaway greenhouse effect.[49] He testified to the US Congress in 1985 that the greenhouse effect would change the earth's climate system.[50] Sagan and his Cornell colleague Edwin Ernest Salpeter speculated about life in Jupiter's clouds, given the planet's dense atmospheric composition rich in organic molecules. He studied the observed color variations on Mars' surface and concluded that they were not seasonal or vegetational changes as most believed,[clarification needed] but shifts in surface dust caused by windstorms./nSagan is also known for his research on the possibilities of extraterrestrial life, including experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from basic chemicals by radiation.[51][52]/nHe is also the 1994 recipient of the Public Welfare Medal, the highest award of the National Academy of Sciences for \"distinguished contributions in the application of science to the public welfare.\"[53] He was denied membership in the academy, reportedly because his media activities made him unpopular with many other scientists.[54][55][56]/nAs of 2017[update], Sagan is the most cited SETI scientist and one of the most cited planetary scientists.[5]/nIn 1980 Sagan co-wrote and narrated the award-winning 13-part PBS television series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, which became the most widely watched series in the history of American public television until 1990. The show has been seen by at least 500 million people across 60 countries.[6][57][58] The book, Cosmos, written by Sagan, was published to accompany the series.[59]/nBecause of his earlier popularity as a science writer from his best-selling books, including The Dragons of Eden, which won him a Pulitzer Prize in 1977, he was asked to write and narrate the show. It was targeted to a general audience of viewers, whom Sagan felt had lost interest in science, partly due to a stifled educational system.[60]/nEach of the 13 episodes was created to focus on a particular subject or person, thereby demonstrating the synergy of the universe.[60] They covered a wide range of scientific subjects including the origin of life and a perspective of humans' place on Earth./nThe show won an Emmy,[61] along with a Peabody Award, and transformed Sagan from an obscure astronomer into a pop-culture icon.[62] Time magazine ran a cover story about Sagan soon after the show broadcast, referring to him as \"creator, chief writer and host-narrator of the show.\"[63] In 2000, \"Cosmos\" was released on a remastered set of DVDs./nAfter Cosmos aired, Sagan became associated with the catchphrase \"billions and billions\", although he never actually used the phrase in the Cosmos series.[64] He rather used the term \"billions upon billions.\"[65]/nRichard Feynman, a precursor to Sagan, used the phrase \"billions and billions\" many times in his \"red books.\" However, Sagan's frequent use of the word billions and distinctive delivery emphasizing the \"b\" (which he did intentionally, in place of more cumbersome alternatives such as \"billions with a 'b'\", in order to distinguish the word from \"millions\")[64] made him a favorite target of comic performers, including Johnny Carson,[66][67] Gary Kroeger, Mike Myers, Bronson Pinchot, Penn Jillette, Harry Shearer, and others. Frank Zappa satirized the line in the song \"Be in My Video\", noting as well \"atomic light.\" Sagan took this all in good humor, and his final book was entitled Billions and Billions, which opened with a tongue-in-cheek discussion of this catchphrase, observing that Carson was an amateur astronomer and that Carson's comic caricature often included real science.[64]/nAs a humorous tribute to Sagan and his association with the catchphrase \"billions and billions\", a sagan has been defined as a unit of measurement equivalent to a very large number of anything.[68][69]/nSagan's number is the number of stars in the observable universe.[70] This number is reasonably well defined, because it is known what stars are and what the observable universe is, but its value is highly uncertain./n/nSagan's ability to convey his ideas allowed many people to understand the cosmos better\u2014simultaneously emphasizing the value and worthiness of the human race, and the relative insignificance of the Earth in comparison to the Universe. He delivered the 1977 series of Royal Institution Christmas Lectures in London.[75]/nSagan was a proponent of the search for extraterrestrial life. He urged the scientific community to listen with radio telescopes for signals from potential intelligent extraterrestrial life-forms. Sagan was so persuasive that by 1982 he was able to get a petition advocating SETI published in the journal Science, signed by 70 scientists, including seven Nobel Prize winners. This signaled a tremendous increase in the respectability of a then-controversial field. Sagan also helped Frank Drake write the Arecibo message, a radio message beamed into space from the Arecibo radio telescope on November 16, 1974, aimed at informing potential extraterrestrials about Earth./nSagan was chief technology officer of the professional planetary research journal Icarus for 12 years. He co-founded The Planetary Society and was a member of the SETI Institute Board of Trustees. Sagan served as Chairman of the Division for Planetary Science of the American Astronomical Society, as President of the Planetology Section of the American Geophysical Union, and as Chairman of the Astronomy Section of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)./nAt the height of the Cold War, Sagan became involved in nuclear disarmament efforts by promoting hypotheses on the effects of nuclear war, when Paul Crutzen's \"Twilight at Noon\" concept suggested that a substantial nuclear exchange could trigger a nuclear twilight and upset the delicate balance of life on Earth by cooling the surface. In 1983 he was one of five authors\u2014the \"S\"\u2014in the follow-up \"TTAPS\" model (as the research article came to be known), which contained the first use of the term \"nuclear winter\", which his colleague Richard P. Turco had coined.[76] In 1984 he co-authored the book The Cold and the Dark: The World after Nuclear War and in 1990 the book A Path Where No Man Thought: Nuclear Winter and the End of the Arms Race, which explains the nuclear-winter hypothesis and advocates nuclear disarmament. Sagan received a great deal of skepticism and disdain for the use of media to disseminate a very uncertain hypothesis. A personal correspondence with nuclear physicist Edward Teller around 1983 began amicably, with Teller expressing support for continued research to ascertain the credibility of the winter hypothesis. However, Sagan and Teller's correspondence would ultimately result in Teller writing: \"A propagandist is one who uses incomplete information to produce maximum persuasion. I can compliment you on being, indeed, an excellent propagandist, remembering that a propagandist is the better the less he appears to be one.\"[77] Biographers of Sagan would also comment that from a scientific viewpoint, nuclear winter was a low point for Sagan, although, politically speaking, it popularized his image amongst the public.[77]/nThe adult Sagan remained a fan of science fiction, although disliking stories that were not realistic (such as ignoring the inverse-square law) or, he said, did not include \"thoughtful pursuit of alternative futures.\"[21] He wrote books to popularize science, such as Cosmos, which reflected and expanded upon some of the themes of A Personal Voyage and became the best-selling science book ever published in English;[78] The Dragons of Eden: Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence, which won a Pulitzer Prize; and Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science. Sagan also wrote the best-selling science fiction novel Contact in 1985, based on a film treatment he wrote with his wife, Ann Druyan, in 1979, but he did not live to see the book's 1997 motion-picture adaptation, which starred Jodie Foster and won the 1998 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation./nOn it, everyone you ever heard of... The aggregate of all our joys and sufferings, thousands of confident religions, ideologies and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilizations, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every hopeful child, every mother and father, every inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every superstar, every supreme leader, every saint and sinner in the history of our species, lived there on a mote of dust, suspended in a sunbeam.\u00a0...  Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot./nSagan wrote a sequel to Cosmos, Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space, which was selected as a notable book of 1995 by The New York Times. He appeared on PBS's Charlie Rose program in January 1995.[45] Sagan also wrote the introduction for Stephen Hawking's bestseller A Brief History of Time. Sagan was also known for his popularization of science, his efforts to increase scientific understanding among the general public, and his positions in favor of scientific skepticism and against pseudoscience, such as his debunking of the Betty and Barney Hill abduction. To mark the tenth anniversary of Sagan's death, David Morrison, a former student of Sagan, recalled \"Sagan's immense contributions to planetary research, the public understanding of science, and the skeptical movement\" in Skeptical Inquirer.[37]/nFollowing Saddam Hussein's threats to light Kuwait's oil wells on fire in response to any physical challenge to Iraqi control of the oil assets, Sagan together with his \"TTAPS\" colleagues and Paul Crutzen, warned in January 1991 in The Baltimore Sun and Wilmington Morning Star newspapers that if the fires were left to burn over a period of several months, enough smoke from the 600 or so 1991 Kuwaiti oil fires \"might get so high as to disrupt agriculture in much of South Asia\u00a0...\" and that this possibility should \"affect the war plans\";[81][82] these claims were also the subject of a televised debate between Sagan and physicist Fred Singer on January 22, aired on the ABC News program Nightline.[83][84]/nIn the televised debate, Sagan argued that the effects of the smoke would be similar to the effects of a nuclear winter, with Singer arguing to the contrary. After the debate, the fires burnt for many months before extinguishing efforts were complete. The results of the smoke did not produce continental-sized cooling. Sagan later conceded in The Demon-Haunted World that the prediction did not turn out to be correct: \"it was pitch black at noon and temperatures dropped 4\u20136\u00a0\u00b0C over the Persian Gulf, but not much smoke reached stratospheric altitudes and Asia was spared.\"[85]/nIn his later years Sagan advocated the creation of an organized search for asteroids/near-Earth objects (NEOs) that might impact the Earth but to forestall or postpone developing the technological methods that would be needed to defend against them.[86] He argued that all of the numerous methods proposed to alter the orbit of an asteroid, including the employment of nuclear detonations, created a deflection dilemma: if the ability to deflect an asteroid away from the Earth exists, then one would also have the ability to divert a non-threatening object towards Earth, creating an immensely destructive weapon.[87][88] In a 1994 paper he co-authored, he ridiculed a 3-day long \"Near-Earth Object Interception Workshop\" held by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in 1993 that did not, \"even in passing\" state that such interception and deflection technologies could have these \"ancillary dangers.\"[87]/nSagan remained hopeful that the natural NEO impact threat and the intrinsically double-edged essence of the methods to prevent these threats would serve as a \"new and potent motivation to maturing international relations.\"[87][89] Later acknowledging that, with sufficient international oversight, in the future a \"work our way up\" approach to implementing nuclear explosive deflection methods could be fielded, and when sufficient knowledge was gained, to use them to aid in mining asteroids.[88] His interest in the use of nuclear detonations in space grew out of his work in 1958 for the Armour Research Foundation's Project A119, concerning the possibility of detonating a nuclear device on the lunar surface.[90]/nSagan was a critic of Plato, having said of the ancient Greek philosopher: \"Science and mathematics were to be removed from the hands of the merchants and the artisans. This tendency found its most effective advocate in a follower of Pythagoras named Plato\" and[91]/nHe (Plato) believed that ideas were far more real than the natural world. He advised the astronomers not to waste their time observing the stars and planets. It was better, he believed, just to think about them. Plato expressed hostility to observation and experiment. He taught contempt for the real world and disdain for the practical application of scientific knowledge. Plato's followers succeeded in extinguishing the light of science and experiment that had been kindled by Democritus and the other Ionians./nIn 1995 (as part of his book The Demon-Haunted World) Sagan popularized a set of tools for skeptical thinking called the \"baloney detection kit\", a phrase first coined by Arthur Felberbaum, a friend of his wife Ann Druyan.[92]/nSpeaking about his activities in popularizing science, Sagan said that there were at least two reasons for scientists to share the purposes of science and its contemporary state. Simple self-interest was one: much of the funding for science came from the public, and the public therefore had the right to know how the money was being spent. If scientists increased public admiration for science, there was a good chance of having more public supporters.[93] The other reason was the excitement of communicating one's own excitement about science to others.[10]/nFollowing the success of Cosmos, Sagan set up his own publishing firm, Cosmos Store, to publish science books for the general public. It was not successful.[94]/nWhile Sagan was widely adored by the general public, his reputation in the scientific community was more polarized.[95] Critics sometimes characterized his work as fanciful, non-rigorous, and self-aggrandizing,[96] and others complained in his later years that he neglected his role as a faculty member to foster his celebrity status.[97]/nOne of Sagan's harshest critics, Harold Urey, felt that Sagan was getting too much publicity for a scientist and was treating some scientific theories too casually.[98] Urey and Sagan were said to have different philosophies of science, according to Davidson. While Urey was an \"old-time empiricist\" who avoided theorizing about the unknown, Sagan was by contrast willing to speculate openly about such matters.[41] Fred Whipple wanted Harvard to keep Sagan there, but learned that because Urey was a Nobel laureate, his opinion was an important factor in Harvard denying Sagan tenure.[98]/nSagan's Harvard friend Lester Grinspoon also stated: \"I know Harvard well enough to know there are people there who certainly do not like people who are outspoken.\"[98] Grinspoon added:[98]/nWherever you turned, there was one astronomer being quoted on everything, one astronomer whose face you were seeing on TV, and one astronomer whose books had the preferred display slot at the local bookstore./nSome, like Urey, later came to realize that Sagan's popular brand of scientific advocacy was beneficial to the science as a whole.[99] Urey especially liked Sagan's 1977 book The Dragons of Eden and wrote Sagan with his opinion: \"I like it very much and am amazed that someone like you has such an intimate knowledge of the various features of the problem... I congratulate you... You are a man of many talents.\"[99]/nSagan was accused of borrowing some ideas of others for his own benefit and countered these claims by explaining that the misappropriation was an unfortunate side effect of his role as a science communicator and explainer, and that he attempted to give proper credit whenever possible.[98]/nSagan believed that the Drake equation, on substitution of reasonable estimates, suggested that a large number of extraterrestrial civilizations would form, but that the lack of evidence of such civilizations highlighted by the Fermi paradox suggests technological civilizations tend to self-destruct. This stimulated his interest in identifying and publicizing ways that humanity could destroy itself, with the hope of avoiding such a cataclysm and eventually becoming a spacefaring species. Sagan's deep concern regarding the potential destruction of human civilization in a nuclear holocaust was conveyed in a memorable cinematic sequence in the final episode of Cosmos, called \"Who Speaks for Earth?\" Sagan had already resigned[date\u00a0missing] from the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board's UFO-investigating Condon Committee and voluntarily surrendered his top-secret clearance in protest over the Vietnam War.[100] Following his marriage to his third wife (novelist Ann Druyan) in June 1981, Sagan became more politically active\u2014particularly in opposing escalation of the nuclear arms race under President Ronald Reagan./nIn March 1983, Reagan announced the Strategic Defense Initiative\u2014a multibillion-dollar project to develop a comprehensive defense against attack by nuclear missiles, which was quickly dubbed the \"Star Wars\" program. Sagan spoke out against the project, arguing that it was technically impossible to develop a system with the level of perfection required, and far more expensive to build such a system than it would be for an enemy to defeat it through decoys and other means\u2014and that its construction would seriously destabilize the \"nuclear balance\" between the United States and the Soviet Union, making further progress toward nuclear disarmament impossible.[101]/nWhen Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev declared a unilateral moratorium on the testing of nuclear weapons, which would begin on August 6, 1985\u2014the 40th\u00a0anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima\u2014the Reagan administration dismissed the dramatic move as nothing more than propaganda and refused to follow suit. In response, US anti-nuclear and peace activists staged a series of protest actions at the Nevada Test Site, beginning on Easter Sunday in 1986 and continuing through 1987. Hundreds of people in the \"Nevada Desert Experience\" group were arrested, including Sagan, who was arrested on two separate occasions as he climbed over a chain-link fence at the test site during the underground Operation Charioteer and United States's Musketeer nuclear test series of detonations.[102]/nSagan was also a vocal advocate of the controversial notion of testosterone poisoning, arguing in 1992 that human males could become gripped by an \"unusually severe [case of] testosterone poisoning\" and this could compel them to become genocidal.[103] In his review of Moondance magazine writer Daniela Gioseffi's 1990 book Women on War, he argues that females are the only half of humanity \"untainted by testosterone poisoning.\"[104] One chapter of his 1993 book Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors is dedicated to testosterone and its alleged poisonous effects.[105]/nIn 1989, Carl Sagan was interviewed by Ted Turner whether he believed in socialism and responded that: \"I'm not sure what a socialist is. But I believe the government has a responsibility to care for the people... I'm talking about making the people self-reliant.\"[106]/nSagan was married three times. In 1957, he married biologist Lynn Margulis. The couple had two children, Jeremy and Dorion Sagan; their marriage ended in 1964. Sagan married artist Linda Salzman in 1968 and they had a child together, Nick Sagan, and divorced in 1981. During these marriages, Carl Sagan focused heavily on his career, a factor which may have contributed to Sagan's first divorce.[37] In 1981, Sagan married author Ann Druyan and they later had two children, Alexandra (known as Sasha) and Samuel Sagan. Carl Sagan and Druyan remained married until his death in 1996./nWhile teaching at Cornell, he lived in an Egyptian revival house in Ithaca perched on the edge of a cliff that had formerly been the headquarters of a Cornell secret society.[107] While there he drove a red Porsche 911 Targa and an orange 1970 Porsche 914[108] with the license plate PHOBOS./nIn 1994, engineers at Apple Computer code-named the Power Macintosh\u00a07100 \"Carl Sagan\" in the hope that Apple would make \"billions and billions\" with the sale of the PowerMac\u00a07100.[9] The name was only used internally, but Sagan was concerned that it would become a product endorsement and sent Apple a cease-and-desist letter. Apple complied, but engineers retaliated by changing the internal codename to \"BHA\" for \"Butt-Head Astronomer.\"[109][110] In November 1995, after further legal battle, an out-of-court settlement was reached and Apple's office of trademarks and patents released a conciliatory statement that \"Apple has always had great respect for Dr.\u00a0Sagan. It was never Apple's intention to cause Dr.\u00a0Sagan or his family any embarrassment or concern.\"[111]/nIn 2019, Carl Sagan's daughter Sasha Sagan released For Small Creatures Such as We: Rituals for Finding Meaning in our Unlikely World, which depicts life with her parents and her father's death when she was fourteen.[112] Building on a theme in her father's work, Sasha Sagan argues in For Small Creatures Such as We that skepticism does not imply pessimism.[113]/nI have just finished The Cosmic Connection and loved every word of it. You are my idea of a good writer because you have an unmannered style, and when I read what you write, I hear you talking. One thing about the book made me nervous. It was entirely too obvious that you are smarter than I am. I hate that./nIsaac Asimov, in a letter to Sagan, 1973[114]/nSagan was acquainted with science fiction fandom through his friendship with Isaac Asimov, and he spoke at the Nebula Awards ceremony in 1969.[115][116] Asimov described Sagan as one of only two people he ever met whose intellect surpassed his own, the other being computer scientist and artificial intelligence expert Marvin Minsky.[117]/nSagan wrote frequently about religion and the relationship between religion and science, expressing his skepticism about the conventional conceptualization of God as a sapient being. For example:/nSome people think God is an outsized, light-skinned male with a long white beard, sitting on a throne somewhere up there in the sky, busily tallying the fall of every sparrow. Others\u2014for example Baruch Spinoza and Albert Einstein\u2014considered God to be essentially the sum total of the physical laws which describe the universe. I do not know of any compelling evidence for anthropomorphic patriarchs controlling human destiny from some hidden celestial vantage point, but it would be madness to deny the existence of physical laws.[118]/nIn another description of his view on the concept of God, Sagan wrote:/nThe idea that God is an oversized white male with a flowing beard who sits in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous. But if by God one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe, then clearly there is such a God. This God is emotionally unsatisfying\u00a0... it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity.[119]/nOn atheism, Sagan commented in 1981:/nAn atheist is someone who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has compelling evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, we would have to know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.[120]/nSagan also commented on Christianity and the Jefferson Bible, stating \"My long-time view about Christianity is that it represents an amalgam of two seemingly immiscible parts, the religion of Jesus and the religion of Paul. Thomas Jefferson attempted to excise the Pauline parts of the New Testament. There wasn't much left when he was done, but it was an inspiring document.\"[121]/nSagan thought that spirituality should be scientifically informed and that traditional religions should be abandoned and replaced with belief systems that revolve around the scientific method,[122] but also the mystery and incompleteness of scientific fields. Regarding spirituality and its relationship with science, Sagan stated:/n'Spirit' comes from the Latin word 'to breathe'. What we breathe is air, which is certainly matter, however thin. Despite usage to the contrary, there is no necessary implication in the word 'spiritual' that we are talking of anything other than matter (including the matter of which the brain is made), or anything\noutside the realm of science. On occasion, I will feel free to use the word. Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light-years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual.[123]/nAn environmental appeal, \"Preserving and Cherishing the Earth\", primarily written by Sagan and signed by him and other noted scientists as well as religious leaders, and published in January 1990, stated that \"The historical record makes clear that religious teaching, example, and leadership are powerfully able to influence personal conduct and commitment... Thus, there is a vital role for religion and science.\"[124]/nIn reply to a question in 1996 about his religious beliefs, Sagan answered, \"I'm agnostic.\"[125] Sagan maintained that the idea of a creator God of the Universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an infinitely old universe.[126] His son, Dorion Sagan said, \"My father believed in the God of Spinoza and Einstein, God not behind nature but as nature, equivalent to it.\"[127] His last wife, Ann Druyan, stated:/nWhen my husband died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, many people would come up to me\u2014it still sometimes happens\u2014and ask me if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently ask me if I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again. I don't ever expect to be reunited with Carl.[128]/nIn 2006, Ann Druyan edited Sagan's 1985 Glasgow Gifford Lectures in Natural Theology into a book, The Varieties of Scientific Experience: A Personal View of the Search for God, in which he elaborates on his views of divinity in the natural world./nSagan is also widely regarded as a freethinker or skeptic; one of his most famous quotations, in Cosmos, was, \"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\"[129] (called the \"Sagan standard\" by some[130]). This was based on a nearly identical statement by fellow founder of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, Marcello Truzzi, \"An extraordinary claim requires extraordinary proof.\"[131][132] This idea had been earlier aphorized in Th\u00e9odore Flournoy's work From India to the Planet Mars (1899) from a longer quote by Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749\u20131827), a French mathematician and astronomer, as the Principle of Laplace: \"The weight of the evidence should be proportioned to the strangeness of the facts.\"[133]/nLate in his life, Sagan's books elaborated on his naturalistic view of the world. In The Demon-Haunted World, he presented tools for testing arguments and detecting fallacious or fraudulent ones, essentially advocating the wide use of critical thinking and of the scientific method. The compilation Billions and Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium, published in 1997 after Sagan's death, contains essays written by him, on topics such as his views on abortion, and also an essay by his widow, Ann Druyan, about the relationship between his agnostic and freethinking beliefs and his death./nSagan warned against humans' tendency towards anthropocentrism. He was the faculty adviser for the Cornell Students for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. In the Cosmos chapter \"Blues For a Red Planet\", Sagan wrote, \"If there is life on Mars, I believe we should do nothing with Mars. Mars then belongs to the Martians, even if the Martians are only microbes.\"[134]/nSagan was a user and advocate of marijuana. Under the pseudonym \"Mr.\u00a0X\", he contributed an essay about smoking cannabis to the 1971 book Marihuana Reconsidered.[135][136] The essay explained that marijuana use had helped to inspire some of Sagan's works and enhance sensual and intellectual experiences. After Sagan's death, his friend Lester Grinspoon disclosed this information to Sagan's biographer, Keay Davidson. The publishing of the biography, Carl Sagan: A Life, in 1999 brought media attention to this aspect of Sagan's life.[137][138][139] Not long after his death, his widow Ann Druyan went on to preside over the board of directors of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), a non-profit organization dedicated to reforming cannabis laws.[140][141]/nIn 1947, the year that inaugurated the \"flying saucer\" craze, the young Sagan suspected the \"discs\" might be alien spaceships.[22]/nSagan's interest in UFO reports prompted him on August 3, 1952, to write a letter to U.S.\u00a0Secretary of State Dean Acheson to ask how the United States would respond if flying saucers turned out to be extraterrestrial.[142] He later had several conversations on the subject in 1964 with Jacques Vall\u00e9e.[143] Though quite skeptical of any extraordinary answer to the UFO question, Sagan thought scientists should study the phenomenon, at least because there was widespread public interest in UFO reports./nStuart Appelle notes that Sagan \"wrote frequently on what he perceived as the logical and empirical fallacies regarding UFOs and the abduction experience. Sagan rejected an extraterrestrial explanation for the phenomenon but felt there were both empirical and pedagogical benefits for examining UFO reports and that the subject was, therefore, a legitimate topic of study.\"[144]/nIn 1966, Sagan was a member of the Ad\u00a0Hoc Committee to Review Project Blue Book, the U.S.\u00a0Air Force's UFO investigation project. The committee concluded Blue Book had been lacking as a scientific study, and recommended a university-based project to give the UFO phenomenon closer scientific scrutiny. The result was the Condon Committee (1966\u201368), led by physicist Edward Condon, and in their final report they formally concluded that UFOs, regardless of what any of them actually were, did not behave in a manner consistent with a threat to national security./nSociologist Ron Westrum writes that \"The high point of Sagan's treatment of the UFO question was the AAAS' symposium in 1969. A wide range of educated opinions on the subject were offered by participants, including not only proponents such as James McDonald and J.\u00a0Allen Hynek but also skeptics like astronomers William Hartmann and Donald Menzel. The roster of speakers was balanced, and it is to Sagan's credit that this event was presented in spite of pressure from Edward Condon.\"[143] With physicist Thornton Page, Sagan edited the lectures and discussions given at the symposium; these were published in 1972 as UFO's: A Scientific Debate. Some of Sagan's many books examine UFOs (as did one episode of Cosmos) and he claimed a religious undercurrent to the phenomenon./nSagan again revealed his views on interstellar travel in his 1980 Cosmos series. In one of his last written works, Sagan argued that the chances of extraterrestrial spacecraft visiting Earth are vanishingly small. However, Sagan did think it plausible that Cold War concerns contributed to governments misleading their citizens about UFOs, and wrote that \"some UFO reports and analyses, and perhaps voluminous files, have been made inaccessible to the public which pays the bills\u00a0... It's time for the files to be declassified and made generally available.\" He cautioned against jumping to conclusions about suppressed UFO data and stressed that there was no strong evidence that aliens were visiting the Earth either in the past or present.[145]/nSagan briefly served as an adviser on Stanley Kubrick's film 2001: A Space Odyssey.[146] Sagan proposed that the film suggest, rather than depict, extraterrestrial superintelligence.[147]/nSagan's contribution to the 1969 AAAS symposium was an attack on the belief that UFOs are piloted by extraterrestrial beings. Using the Drake equation and applying several logical assumptions, Sagan calculated the possible number of advanced civilizations capable of interstellar travel to be about one million. He projected that any civilization wishing to check on all the others on a regular basis of, say, once a year would have to launch 10,000 spacecraft annually. Not only does that seem like an unreasonable number of launchings, but it would take all the material in one percent of the universe's stars to produce all the spaceships needed for all the civilizations to seek each other out./nTo argue that the Earth was being chosen for regular visitations, Sagan said, one would have to assume that the planet is somehow unique, and that assumption \"goes exactly against the idea that there are lots of civilizations around. Because if there are then our sort of civilization must be pretty common. And if we're not pretty common then there aren't going to be many civilizations advanced enough to send visitors.\"/nThis argument, which some called Sagan's paradox, helped to establish a new school of thought, namely the belief that extraterrestrial life exists, but it has nothing to do with UFOs. The new belief had a salutary effect on UFO studies. It helped separate researchers who wanted to distinguish UFOs from those who wanted to identify their pilots and it gave scientists opportunities to search the universe for intelligent life unencumbered by the stigma associated with UFOs.[148]/nAfter suffering from myelodysplasia for two years and receiving three bone marrow transplants from his sister, Sagan died from pneumonia at the age of 62 at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle on December 20, 1996.[10][149] He was buried at Lake View Cemetery in Ithaca, New York./nThe 1997 film Contact was based on the only novel Sagan wrote[169] and finished after his death.  It ends with the dedication \"For Carl.\"  His photo can also be seen in the film./nIn 1997, the Sagan Planet Walk was opened in Ithaca, New York. It is a walking-scale model of the Solar System, extending 1.2\u00a0km from the center of The Commons in downtown Ithaca to the Sciencenter, a hands-on museum. The exhibition was created in memory of Carl Sagan, who was an Ithaca resident and Cornell Professor. Professor Sagan had been a founding member of the museum's advisory board.[170]/nThe landing site of the uncrewed Mars Pathfinder spacecraft was renamed the Carl Sagan Memorial Station on July 5, 1997./nAsteroid 2709\u00a0Sagan is named in his honor,[92] as is the Carl Sagan Institute for the search of habitable planets./nSagan's son, Nick Sagan, wrote several episodes in the Star Trek franchise. In an episode of Star Trek: Enterprise entitled \"Terra Prime\", a quick shot is shown of the relic rover Sojourner, part of the Mars Pathfinder mission, placed by a historical marker at Carl Sagan Memorial Station on the Martian surface. The marker displays a quote from Sagan: \"Whatever the reason you're on Mars, I'm glad you're there, and I wish I was with you.\" Sagan's student Steve Squyres led the team that landed the rovers Spirit and Opportunity successfully on Mars in 2004./nOn November 9, 2001, on what would have been Sagan's 67th birthday, the Ames Research Center dedicated the site for the Carl Sagan Center for the Study of Life in the Cosmos. \"Carl was an incredible visionary, and now his legacy can be preserved and advanced by a 21st\u00a0century research and education laboratory committed to enhancing our understanding of life in the universe and furthering the cause of space exploration for all time\", said NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin. Ann Druyan was at the center as it opened its doors on October 22, 2006./nSagan has at least three awards named in his honor:/nAugust 2007 the Independent Investigations Group (IIG) awarded Sagan posthumously a Lifetime Achievement Award. This honor has also been awarded to Harry Houdini and James Randi.[172]/nIn September 2008, a musical compositor Benn Jordan released his album Pale Blue Dot as a tribute to Carl Sagan's life.[173][174]/nBeginning in 2009, a musical project known as Symphony of Science sampled several excerpts of Sagan from his series Cosmos and remixed them to electronic music. To date, the videos have received over 21\u00a0million views worldwide on YouTube.[175]/nThe 2014 Swedish science fiction short film Wanderers uses excerpts of Sagan's narration in 1994 of his book Pale Blue Dot, played over digitally-created visuals of humanity's possible future expansion into outer space.[176][177]/nIn February 2015, the Finnish-based symphonic metal band Nightwish released the song \"Sagan\" as a non-album bonus track for their single \"\u00c9lan.\"[178] The song, written by the band's songwriter/composer/keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, is an homage to the life and work of the late Carl Sagan./nIn August 2015, it was announced that a biopic of Sagan's life was being planned by Warner Bros.[179]/nOn October 21, 2019, the Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan Theater was opened at the Center for Inquiry West in Los Angeles.[180]/nIn 2022, Sagan was posthumously awarded the Future of Life Award \"for reducing the risk of nuclear war by developing and popularizing the science of nuclear winter.\" The honor, shared by seven other recipients involved in nuclear winter research, was accepted by his widow, Ann Druyan.[181]/nIn 2022, the audiobook recording of Sagan's 1994 book Pale Blue Dot was selected by the U.S. Library of Congress for inclusion in the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"[182][183]/nIn 2023, a movie Voyagers by Sebasti\u00e1n Lelio was announced with Sagan played by Andrew Garfield and with Daisy Edgar-Jones playing Sagan's 3rd wife, Ann Druyan.[184]", "989870": "Elizabeth Helen Blackburn, AC FRS FAA FRSN[2] (born 26 November 1948) is an Australian-American Nobel laureate who is the former president of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.[3]  In 1984, Blackburn co-discovered telomerase, the enzyme that replenishes the telomere, with Carol W. Greider. For this work, she was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, sharing it with Carol W. Greider and Jack W. Szostak, becoming the first Australian woman Nobel laureate./nShe also worked in medical ethics, and was controversially dismissed from the Bush administration's President's Council on Bioethics.  170 scientists signed an open letter to the president in her support, maintaining that she was fired because of political opposition to her advice.[4]/nElizabeth Helen Blackburn, the second of seven children, was born in Hobart, Tasmania, on 26 November 1948, with both her parents being family physicians.[5][6] Her family moved to the city of Launceston when she was four, where she attended the Broadland House Church of England Girls' Grammar School (later amalgamated with Launceston Church Grammar School) until the age of sixteen./nUpon her family's relocation to Melbourne, she attended University High School, and ultimately gained very high marks in the end-of-year final statewide matriculation exams.[7] She went on to earn a Bachelor of Science in 1970 and Master of Science in 1972, both from the University of Melbourne in the field of biochemistry. Blackburn then went to receive her PhD in 1975 from Darwin College at the University of Cambridge,[6] for work she did with Frederick Sanger at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology developing methods to sequence DNA using RNA, as well as studying the bacteriophage Phi X 174.[5][8]/nDuring her postdoctoral work at Yale, Blackburn was doing research on the protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila and noticed a repeating codon at the end of the linear rDNA which varied in size.[9] Blackburn then noticed that this hexanucleotide at the end of the chromosome contained a TTAGGG sequence that was tandemly repeated, and the terminal end of the chromosomes were palindromic. These characteristics allowed Blackburn and colleagues to conduct further research on the protozoan. Using the telomeric repeated end of Tetrahymena, Blackburn and colleague Jack Szostak showed the unstable replicating plasmids of yeast were protected from degradation, proving that these sequences contained characteristics of telomeres.[9] This research also proved the telomeric repeats of Tetrahymena were conserved evolutionarily between the species.[9] Through this research, Blackburn and collaborators noticed the replication system for chromosomes was not likely to add to the lengthening of the telomere, and that the addition of these hexanucleotides to the chromosomes was likely due to the activity of an enzyme that is able to transfer specific functional groups.[9] The proposition of a possible transferase-like enzyme led Blackburn and PhD student Carol W. Greider to the discovery of an enzyme with reverse transcriptase activity that was able to fill in the terminal ends of telomeres without leaving the chromosome incomplete and unable to divide without loss of the end of the chromosome.[10] This 1985 discovery led to the purification of this enzyme in lab, showing the transferase-like enzyme contained both RNA and protein components.[9] The RNA portion of the enzyme served as a template for adding the telomeric repeats to the incomplete telomere, and the protein added enzymatic function for the addition of these repeats.Through this breakthrough, the term \"telomerase\" was given to the enzyme, solving the end-replication process that had troubled scientists at the time.[10]/nIn 1984, Blackburn was a biological researcher and professor of biology and physiology at the University of California, San Francisco, studying the telomere, a structure at the end of chromosomes that protects the chromosome./nTelomerase works by adding base pairs to the overhang of DNA on the 3' end, extending the strand until DNA polymerase and an RNA primer can complete the complementary strand and successfully synthesize the double-stranded DNA. Since DNA polymerase only synthesizes DNA in the leading strand direction, the shortening of the telomere results.[11] Through their research, Blackburn and collaborators were able to show that the telomere is effectively replenished by the enzyme telomerase, which conserves cellular division by preventing the rapid loss of genetic information internal to the telomere, leading to cellular aging.[9]/nOn 1 January 2016, Blackburn was interviewed about her studies, discovering telomerase, and her current research. When she was asked to recall the moment of telomerase discovery she stated:[12]/nCarol had done this experiment, and we stood, just in the lab, and I remember sort of standing there, and she had this \u2013 we call it a gel. It's an autoradiogram because there were trace amounts of radioactivity that were used to develop an image of the separated DNA products of what turned out to be the telomerase enzyme reaction. I remember looking at it and just thinking, 'Ah! This could be very big. This looks just right.' It had a pattern to it. There was a regularity to it. There was something that was not just sort of garbage there, and that was really kind of coming through, even though we look back at it now, we'd say, technically, there was this, that, and the other, but it was a pattern shining through, and it just had this sort of sense, 'Ah! There's something real here.' But then, of course, the good scientist has to be very skeptical and immediately say, 'Okay, we're going to test this every way around here, and really nail this one way or the other.' If it's going to be true, you have to make sure that it's true, because you can get a lot of false leads, especially if you're wanting something to work.[12]/nIn 1978, Blackburn joined the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley, in the Department of Molecular Biology. In 1990, she moved across the San Francisco Bay to the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), where she served as the Department Chair from 1993 to 1999 and was the Morris Herzstein Professor of Biology and Physiology at UCSF. Blackburn became a Professor Emeritus at UCSF at the end of 2015.[13][14]/nBlackburn co-founded the company Telomere Health which offers telomere length testing to the public, but later severed ties with the company.[15][16]/nIn 2015, Blackburn was announced as the new President of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. \"Few scientists garner the kind of admiration and respect that Dr. Blackburn receives from her peers for her scientific accomplishments and her leadership, service and integrity\", says Irwin M. Jacobs, chairman of Salk's Board of Trustees, on Blackburn's appointment as President of the institute. \"Her deep insight as a scientist, her vision as a leader, and her warm personality will prove invaluable as she guides the Salk Institute on its continuing journey of discovery\". \u00a0In 2017, she announced her plans to retire from the Salk Institute the following year.[17]/nFor their research and contributions to the understanding of telomeres and the enzyme telomerase, Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider, and Jack Szostak were awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The substantial research on the effects of chromosomal protection from telomerase, and the impact this has on cellular division has been a revolutionary catalyst in the field of molecular biology.[18] For example, the addition of telomerase to cells that do not possess this enzyme has shown to bypass the limit of cellular ageing in those cells, thereby linking this enzyme to reduced cellular aging.[18] The addition of telomerase, and the presence of the enzyme in cancer cells has been shown to provide an immunity mechanism for the cell in proliferating, linking the transferase activity to increased cellular growth and reduced sensitivity for cellular signaling. Telomeres are also believed to play an important role in certain types of cancers, including pancreatic, bone, prostate, bladder, lung, kidney, and head and neck cancer.[19] The importance of discovering this enzyme has since led her continued research at the University of California San Francisco, where she studies the effect of telomeres and telomerase activity on cellular aging.[20]/nBlackburn was appointed a member of the President's Council on Bioethics in 2002.[21] She supported human embryonic cell research, in opposition to the Bush administration. Her Council terms were terminated by White House directive on 27 February 2004.[22] Dr. Blackburn believes that she was dismissed from the Council due to her disapproval of the Bush administration's position against stem cell research.[23] This was followed by expressions of outrage over her removal by many scientists, 170 of whom signed an open letter to the president maintaining that she was fired because of political opposition to her advice.[24]/nScientists and ethicists at the time even went as far as to say that Blackburn's removal was in violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, which \"requires balance on such advisory bodies\"[23]/n\"There is a growing sense that scientific research\u2014which, after all, is defined by the quest for truth\u2014is being manipulated for political ends\", wrote Blackburn. \"There is evidence that such manipulation is being achieved through the stacking of the membership of advisory bodies and through the delay and misrepresentation of their reports.\"[25][26]/nBlackburn serves on the Science Advisory Board of the Regenerative Medicine Foundation formerly known as the Genetics Policy Institute.[27]/nIn recent years Blackburn and her colleagues have been investigating the effect of stress on telomerase and telomeres[28] with particular emphasis on mindfulness meditation.[29][30] She is also one of several biologists (and one of two Nobel Prize laureates) in the 1995 science documentary Death by Design/The Life and Times of Life and Times. She also featured in the 2012 Emmy award-winning science documentary, 'Decoding Immortality' (also known as 'Immortal') by Genepool Productions.[31] Studies suggest that chronic psychological stress may accelerate ageing at the cellular level. Intimate partner violence was found to shorten telomere length in formerly abused women versus never abused women, possibly causing poorer overall health and greater morbidity in abused women.[32]/nAt the University of California San Francisco, Blackburn currently researches telomeres and telomerase in many organisms, from yeast to human cells.[20] The lab is focused on telomere maintenance, and how this has an impact on cellular aging. Many chronic diseases have been associated with the improper maintenance of these telomeres, thereby affecting cellular division, cycling, and impaired growth. At the cutting edge of telomere research, the Blackburn lab currently investigates the impact of limited maintenance of telomeres in cells through altering the enzyme telomerase.[20]/nBlackburn's first book The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer[33] (2017) was co-authored with health psychologist Dr. Elissa S. Epel of Aging, Metabolism, and Emotions (AME) Center at the UCSF Center for Health and Community.[34] Blackburn comments on ageing reversal and care for one's telomeres through lifestyle: managing chronic stress, exercising, eating better and getting enough sleep; telomere testing, plus cautions and advice.[35] While studying telomeres and the replenishing enzyme, telomerase, Blackburn discovered a vital role played by these protective caps that revolved around one central idea: ageing of cells. The book hones in on many of the effects that poor health can have on telomeres and telomerase activity.[36] Since telomeres shorten with every division of a cell, replenishing these caps is essential to long term cell growth. Through research and data, Blackburn explained that people that lead stressful lives exhibit less telomerase functioning in the body, which leads to a decrease in the dividing capabilities of the cell.[36] Once telomeres shorten drastically, the cells can no longer divide, meaning the tissues they replenish with every division would therefore die out, highlighting the ageing mechanism in humans. To increase telomerase activity in people with stress-filled lives, Blackburn suggests moderate exercise, even 15 minutes a day, which has been proven to stimulate telomerase activity and replenish the telomere.[36]/nBlackburn states that unhappiness in lives also has an effect on the shortening of telomeres. In a study done on divorced couples, their telomere length was \"significantly shorter\" compared to couples in healthy relationships, and Blackburn states, \"There's an obvious stressor\u00a0... we are intensely social beings.\"[37] She suggests positivity in daily life increases health. While increasing the amount of exercise, decreasing stress, and tobacco use, and maintaining a balanced sleep schedule, Blackburn explains that telomere length can be maintained, leading to a decrease in cell aging.[37] Blackburn also tells readers to be wary of clinical pills that proclaim to lengthen or telomeres and protect the body from aging. She says that these pills and creams have no scientific proof of being anti-aging supplements and that the key to preserving our telomeres and stimulating telomerase activity comes from leading a healthy life.[37]/nWhile working at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, Blackburn met her husband John Sedat.[38] Sedat had taken a position at Yale, where she then decided to finish her postdoctoral.[5][6] \"Thus it was that love brought me to a most fortunate and influential choice: Joe Gall\u2019s lab at Yale.\" They moved to New Haven and were married soon after.[6]/nBlackburn splits her time living between La Jolla and San Francisco with her husband, and has a son, Benjamin, born in 1986.[6][39] She serves as a mentor and advocate for scientific research and policy.[40]/nBlackburn's awards and honors include:/nBlackburn was elected:/nIn 2007, Blackburn was listed among Time magazine's 100 people who shape our world.[58]", "7215796": "Hugh John Forster Cairns FRS[3] (21 November 1922 \u2013 12 November 2018) was a British physician and molecular biologist who made significant contributions to molecular genetics, cancer research, and public health./nCairns received his M.D. from Oxford.

J. P. Rohilkhand University and after securing a PhD for his thesis on serum glycoproteins in 1981, he did the first part of his post-doctoral work at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi where his work was based on fluorosis. Moving to the University of Connecticut Health Center in 1982, Sharma continued his post-doc work at the laboratory of Marvin Lawrence Tanzer on molecular biology and biochemistry of collagens. However, when he moved to Public Health Research Institute in 1984, his focus shifted to molecular parasitology which remained the main theme of his researches thereafter. He returned to India to join National Institute of Malaria Research (erstwhile Malaria Research Centre) as a Pool Officer but his stay at NIMR lasted only six months until he was appointed as an associate professor at AIIMS Delhi where he established a laboratory for researches on molecular parasitology.[1] Sharma continues at AIIMS as a professor since 1998 and heads the department of biotechnology[2][3] while serving as the coordinator of Bioinformatics Centre of the institution.[4] In 2011, he also served as a part of the two-member committee constituted to investigate the plagiarism charges against one of the senior doctors of AIIMS.[5]/nDuring his days at Public Health Research Institute, Sharma was successful in cloning the knob protein gene of Plasmodium falciparum, one of the protozoan parasites causing malaria, in 1984.[1] At AIIMS, he led a group of researchers who carried out molecular epidemiological studies of the parasites causing malaria and their studies widened the understanding of the parasites' resistance to chloroquine and antifolate drugs.[6] Sharma is credited with the identification of P. falciparum strains in India, isolation of P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, another non-cultivable protozoan parasite,[7] as well as the development of a genomic library of Plasmodium vivax.[1][8] It was his group which reported the first incidence of malaria in humans caused by Plasmodium knowlesi, a primate malarial parasite.[3] These studies are reported to have relevance in developing immunotherapeutic reagents. Sharma 's research have been documented by way of several articles[9][note 1] and the online repository of scientific articles of the Indian Academy of Sciences has listed a number of them.[10] His work has been cited by many researchers[11][12][13][14] and he has mentored over 70 master's and doctoral students in their studies.[3]/nThe Council of Scientific and Industrial Research awarded Sharma the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 1994.[15][16] The National Academy of Sciences, India elected him as a fellow in 1993[17][18] and he received Dr. M.O.T.

He worked on embryology and examined vertebrate origins in terms of functional phylogeny and proposed a principle of succession of functions in 1875 on how one organ could become the basis for the evolution of another of an entirely different function./nDohrn was born in Stettin (Szczecin), Prussian Province of Pomerania, into a wealthy middle-class family. His grandfather, Heinrich Dohrn, had been a wine and spice merchant, and had made the family fortune by trading in sugar. This wealth allowed Anton's father, Carl August, to devote himself to his various hobbies; travelling, folk music and insects. Anton, the youngest son, read zoology and medicine at various German universities (K\u00f6nigsberg, Bonn, Jena and Berlin). His brother Heinrich Wolfgang Ludwig Dohrn was also a zoologist.[1] pp/nIn 1874 Dohrn married sixteen-year-old Maria Baranowska, a refugee from Poland whom he had met in Messina. They had four children Boguslaw, Wolfgang, Harald and Reinhard. Due to her linguistic abilities, Maria became a successful translator./nDohrn was initially interested in Hemiptera. In 1859, he published Beitrag zur Kenntniss der Harpactoridae in Entomologische Zeitung and the more important Catalogus hemipterorum. He gained his doctorate from Breslau in November 1865 with his thesis \"On the Anatomy of Hemiptera\". At this time, he became associated with the English scientific establishment through his father's friendship with Henry Tibbats Stainton. In 1866, he published a paper on fossil insects Zur Kenntniss der Insecten in den Prim\u00e4rformationen.[2] In this he describes Eugereon boeckingi (Palaeodictyoptera)./nHis ideas changed in summer 1862 when he returned to study at Jena, where Ernst Haeckel introduced him to Darwin's work and theories. Dohrn became a fervent defender of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection./nAt that time comparative embryology was the keystone of morphological evolutionary studies, based on Haeckel's recapitulation theory, the idea that an organism during its embryonic development passes through the major stages of the evolutionary past of its species. Morphology became one of the major ways in which zoologists sought to expand and develop Darwinian theory in the latter years of the 19th century. Dohrn chose to become a \"Darwinian morphologist\"./nDohrn received his doctorate in 1865 at Breslau under Eduard Grube, and his Habilitation in 1868 at Jena with Rudolf Virchow, Ernst Haeckel and Carl Gegenbaur. The study subjects were medicine and zoology, and his Jena monograph was Studien zur Embryologie der Arthropoden. From 1868 to 1870, he was a Docent in zoology at Jena. During these times, he worked several times at facilities located by the sea: Heligoland alongside Haeckel in 1865, Hamburg in 1866, Millport, Scotland with David Robertson in 1867 and 1868 and moved to Messina, Italy, during the winter of 1868 together with his friend and colleague Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay to work on the marine life of the Straits of Messina. In 1870 Dohrn was called up to (briefly) serve in the Franco-Prussian War./nAmong Dohrn's most highly cited theoretical contributions was his so-called \"principle of succession of functions\". It was derived from pre-existing ideas, especially those that had been proposed by the comparative anatomist St. George Mivart. Dohrn's ideas on functional phylogenetics underlie some of the embryological hypotheses such as the origin of the vertebrate jaw from gill arches. In his original writings he claimed that gill slits had changed into a variety of vertebrate organs.[1][3]/nFrom 1850 to 1852, the zoologist and geologist Carl Vogt had lived in Nice where he tried unsuccessfully to enlist support for a marine zoological station (one was later established as Observatoire Oceanologique de Villefranche).[4] In Messina, Dohrn and Miklouho-Maclay conceived a plan to cover the globe with a network of zoological research stations, analogous to railway stations, where scientists could stop, collect material, make observations and conduct experiments, before moving on to the next station./nDohrn realised how useful it would be for scientists to arrive at a location and find a ready to use laboratory. Dohrn rented two rooms for the \"Stazione Zoologica di Messina\", but quickly realized the technical difficulties of studying marine life without a permanent structure and support facilities, such as trained personnel and a library./nIn 1870 Dohrn decided that Naples would be a better place for his Station. This choice was due to the greater biological richness of the Gulf of Naples and also to the possibility of starting a research institute of international importance in a large university town that itself had a strong international element./nAfter a visiting a newly opened aquarium in Berlin, the Berliner Aquarium Unter den Linden he decided that charging the general public to visit an aquarium might earn the laboratory enough money to pay a salary for a permanent assistant. Naples, with a population of 500,000 inhabitants, was one of the largest and most attractive cities of Europe and also had a considerable flow of tourists (30,000 a year) that could potentially visit the aquarium./nDohrn overcame the doubts of the city authorities and persuaded them to give him, free-of-charge, a plot of land at the sea edge, in the beautiful Villa Comunale on the condition that he promised to build the Stazione Zoologica at his own expense./nHe opened the station to visiting scientists in September 1873, and to the general public in January 1874./nIn 1875 Dohrn published Der Ursprung der Wirbelthiere und das Princip des Functionswechsels: Genealogische Skizzen which proposed the \"change of function\" theory of the origin of vertebrates./nIn order to promote the international status of the Stazione and to guarantee its economic and hence political independence and freedom of research, Dohrn introduced a series of innovative measures to finance his project. Firstly, the rental of work and research space (the \"Bench system\"), for an annual fee universities, governments, scientific institutions, private foundations or individuals could send one scientist to the Stazione for one year where he or she would find available all that was required to conduct research (laboratory space, animal supply, chemicals, an exceptional library and expert staff). He contributed his own library and obtained donations of books from publishers and authors, including Darwin.[5] These facilities were supplied with no strings attached, in the sense that investigators were completely free to pursue their own projects and ideas./nThis system worked so that when Anton Dohrn died in 1909 more than 2,200 scientists from Europe and the United States had worked at Naples and more than 50 tables-per-year had been rented out. It might be said that international scientific collaboration in the modern sense was born at the Stazione, based on quick and free communication of ideas, methods and results./nThe success of the Stazione Zoologica, and the new way of thinking and funding research are the main legacies of Dohrn. The model was copied a number of times throughout the world. In 1878 Johns Hopkins University founded the Chesapeake Zoological Laboratory, under the direction of W.K. Brooks. Then, in 1888, the Marine Biological Laboratory was founded at Woods Hole and in 1892 the first laboratory on the United States West Coast, the Hopkins Marine Station, opened in California. In Britain, current marine laboratories that originate from this time include the Dunstaffnage Marine Station (today Scottish Association for Marine Science, 1884), the Gatty Marine Laboratory (University of St Andrews, 1884), the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom (Plymouth, 1888), the Dove Marine Laboratory (Newcastle University, 1897), the Fisheries Research Services Marine Laboratory (Aberdeen, 1899), and the Bangor Marine Station (Queen's University of Belfast, 1903)./nDohrn's name has been immortalised in an undersea feature, the Anton Dohrn Seamount, a seamount in the Rockall Trough, to the north-west of the British Isles, which has become known for the great biodiversity which lives on the cold-water coral, Lophelia pertusa, in this region./nThe Carnegie Institution's Department of Marine Biology laboratory at Dry Tortugas, Florida placed the motor vessel Anton Dohrn in service in July 1911 for ocean science work.[6] The vessel served in the United States Navy as the patrol vessel Anton Dohrn (SP-1086) from 1917 to 1919.[7]", "72030943": "Stefan Catsicas, born in 1958, is a Swiss molecular biologist specialised in neurosciences of Italian and Greek origins.

In 1949, her family moved to Taiwan, where she grew up.[3] She attended a prestigious public school, the Taipei First Girls' High School, which is where she was first drawn to science. Even as a high-school student she was particularly drawn to the field of physics and was inspired by the 1957 Nobel Prize in physics awarded to Tsung Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang as well as the experimental physicist Chien Shiung Wu.[4][5]/nJan attended National Taiwan University where she earned her B.S. in physics in 1968.[3] She then began her graduate studies with the intention of studying theoretical physics at Caltech. Two years later, in 1970, she was inspired by her thesis advisor, Max Delbr\u00fcck (winner of the 1969 Nobel Prize), and  Jerome Vinograd to change her field of study to biology.[3] Switching fields involved Jan sitting for a seven-day, open-book, open-library exam in the field of biology after having passed the qualifying exams for physics graduate students and also a placement test in organism biology. Lily Jan's proposal and her subsequent thesis work was focused on structural studies of rhodopsin localization in mammalian photoreceptors and also in plasma membranes.[6] Her co-mentors for her graduate studies were Jean Paul Revel and Max Delbr\u00fcck. Upon joining the Delbr\u00fcck group, Jan was a member of the membrane biology subgroup where she performed challenging experiments in black lipid bilayers in the sub-terranean sub-basement of the electrical engineering building.[3] The Jans have shared that from this point forward Delbr\u00fcck ensured separation of her graduate work from those of her spouse Yuh Nung Jan given his graduate studies with Delbr\u00fcck were focused on the sensory responses of the fungus Phycomyces to light, among other stimuli.[3]/nLily Jan would go on to hold postdoctoral positions in the laboratory of Seymour Benzer at Caltech and subsequently in the laboratory of Stephen Kuffler at Harvard Medical School. Jan and her husband joined the faculty at University of California, San Francisco in 1979 where are leaders of a joint research group. She has been a HHMI investigator since 1984.[4]/nAfter graduating from Caltech with her Ph.D. in 1974, Lily Jan and her husband Yuh Nung Jan took summer courses at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory together. This coursework would mark the beginning their scientific collaboration which has spanned the majority of their careers. After that at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Jan and her husband would both begin postdoctoral fellowships in the group of Seymour Benzer at Caltech. Their first collaborative effort was building an electrophysiology rig in the laboratory towards the purpose of characterizing the neuromuscular junction in Drosophila fly larvae. This effort would lead to their first two collaborative publications[7][8] which were in print by 1976, only nine years after the Jans first met. During this time, the Jans would first observe that a male mutant ShakerKS133 larvae exhibited an exceptionally large excitatory response after motor stimulation. Unraveling whether the mutant phenotype was linked to the nerve or muscle of Shaker mutant larvae would demarcate the beginning of the Jans' investigations on ion channels./nJan and her husband joined the faculty as assistant professors at UCSF in 1979 where they set up a joint lab. The two investigators only got $15,000 each in start-up money and 1,000\u00a0ft2 to share to set up their lab, however have shared they were drawn to UCSF by the people and the atmosphere.[4]/nThe early years of the Jans' research group at UCSF was distinguished by their efforts on cloning the Shaker channel and studies of neural development. In the 1980s, their work on neural development was performed in collaboration with Alain Ghysen and Christine Dambly-Chaudiere. The Jans were tenured in 1983 and were selected as Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigators in 1984. They have shared that from 1983 to 1986 their research goals were challenged by difficulties cloning the Shaker gene. In 1987, they were successful with cloning Shaker and enabling their team to perform functional studies on single potassium ion channels. Their neural development research has been particularly distinguished by breakthroughs in neurogenesis and cell fate specification (cut, numb, atonal, and daughterless)./nSince 1994, the Jan lab has been organized in function and development subgroups lead by each co-PI. The function group of the laboratory is led by Lily and largely focuses on the studies of ion channels, their assembly, and their dynamic response to neural activity.[9] The development subgroup led by Yuh Nung has been engaged with questions surrounding dendrite morphogenesis.[10]/nIn 1967, Lily Jan traveled to Shitou, Taiwan for a hiking trip to celebrate her college graduation. This trip resulted in her meeting Yuh-Nung Jan and the beginning of their relationship. In 1971, they married with a simple ceremony in a Los Angeles courthouse followed by a celebration camping and hiking in Yosemite.[3]/nThe Jans had their first child together a daughter, Emily Huan-Ching Jan, on August 6, 1977. Lily was still involved in research leading up to her due date and went into early stages of labor in the midst of the group meeting of her postdoctorate lab.[3] Just seven weeks later after celebrating the arrival of Emily, the Jans would move across the country to begin the next stages of their research careers at Harvard Medical School./nJust a few years later, the Jans had established their independent research group at UCSF. In 1984, they were named Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigators. That same year on November 7, 1984 the Jans welcomed their second child, a son named Max Huang-Wen Jan after the Jans\u2019 shared Ph.D. advisor, Max Delbr\u00fcck.[3]/nThe Jans have shared that before their children went to college they rarely attended scientific meetings together such that there was always one parent at home with their children.[3] Outside of the lab, they have continued to enjoy their shared interests in hiking, exploration, and nature throughout their careers.

Liu's laboratory. As a Wyss Technology Fellow, Esvelt was involved with the development of gene drive technology.[4] He focuses on the bioethics and biosafety of gene drives.[5][6][7] In 2016, Esvelt was named an Innovator Under 35 by MIT Technology Review.[8]/nEsvelt was born to an elementary school teacher and a Bonneville Power Administration employee, and spent his childhood between Portland and Seattle.[9] Fascinated by biology from an early age, Esvelt first developed an interest in dinosaurs.[10] He discovered his passion lay in genetics after a trip to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, where he saw what evolution was capable of and wished to achieve similar results using science.[10]/nEsvelt displayed a predilection for bold biological projects early on in his academic career. While an undergraduate at Harvey Mudd, he sought to reversibly induce male infertility using the sperm surface protein fertilin beta.[9] During this time, he was also an advocate for directed panspermia as a defense against extinction of all life, an idea he later rejected.[9]/nWhile a graduate student in David Liu's laboratory, Esvelt demonstrated phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE), a method of using bacteriophages to quickly and efficiently engineer proteins, promoters, and other biomolecules.[3] PACE has since been used to engineer proteases,[11] study antibodies in cancer research,[12] and understand the evolutionary dynamics of proteins.[13]/nIn 2013, Esvelt proposed the idea of using CRISPR in gene drives.[14] Although both methods had been in use independent of each other, Esvelt was the first to connect the two, and with colleagues show that CRISPR could make the implementation of gene drives easier and more efficient.[15]/nThe scientific - and ethical - implications of this new, more straightforward method of conducting gene drives were recognized almost immediately. One author compared gene drives to the fictional substance ice-nine, which freezes over any water it comes into contact with, propagating indefinitely as long as there is more accessible water to freeze.[16] While CRISPR-based gene drives have the potential to generate ecosystem alterations that benefit humanity (e.g., eliminating malaria by spreading infertility genes among a population of mosquitoes), unforeseen (or perhaps intentional) such modifications could result in irreparable environmental damage that directly or indirectly causes great harm to people and animals alike.[9] Keenly aware of the adverse effects even a well-intentioned and thought-out gene drive could have, Esvelt consults both scientists and the public in the course of his planning.[5]/nIn the wake of his controversial work on gene drive technology, and the failures of existing public health structures to adequately respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, Esvelt has become more active in biosecurity research.

He evaluated potential sites in Virginia, and on Maryland's Eastern Shore, but finally settled on Solomons, MD home to an active crab processing facility, in part because the people of Solomons gave him a small building from which to base his operations. In 1925, Truitt founded the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory on Solomons Island, as a joint collaboration between the Carnegie Institute in Washington, DC., Gaucher College, and St. Johns College.

J\u00f3runn published these results on male breast cancer in the medical journal Lancet 1995.[5] Her team participated in further definition of the BRCA2 gene on chromosome 13, and found an Icelandic mutation, BRCA2 999del5, in a male breast cancer case at the end of 1995.[6][7] This mutation proved to be common among Icelandic breast cancer patients of both sexes and was also linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer.[8] Although risk of prostate cancer is much lower than risk of female breast cancer among carriers of this founder mutation, it was shown to be strongly associated with poor prognosis.[9] International studies confirmed this association of BRCA2 mutations with aggressive prostate cancer and this was followed up by the EU funded IMPACT study  Targeted prostate cancer screening that has led to a number of publications regarding prostate cancer in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. Extensive studies on the population impact and clinical relevance of this BRCA2 founder mutation followed[10][11][12] as well as studies on mutations and epigenetic inactivation of the BRCA1 gene in Icelandic cancer patients[13][14] in collaboration with the Icelandic Cancer Registry and researchers at the National University Hospital./nAlong with studies on cancer genetics J\u00f3runn studied chromosomal instability in breast tumor tissue using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) and chromosome painting. Chromosomal instability in breast tumors was shown to be associated with mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53.[15] After the discovery of the Icelandic BRCA2 founder mutation J\u00f3runn and her team demonstrated that complex chromosomal changes and end-to-end chromosome fusions were common in breast tumors from BRCA2 mutation carriers.[16] These findings showed that cells lacking functional BRCA2 protein are prone to DNA damage and suggest that BRCA2 has a role in double strand break repair.[17] This also suggested that the telomere sequences at the ends of chromosomes were more sensitive to BRCA2 related repair deficiencies than the rest of the genome.[18][19]/nJ\u00f3runn's research group participated in The International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), that defined mutation patterns that characterize 20 of the commonest human cancers.

He graduated as Doctor of Medicine from the Free University of Brussels in 1892 and began his work at the Pasteur Institute in Paris in 1894, in the laboratory of Elie Metchnikoff, who had just discovered phagocytosis of bacteria by white blood cells, an expression of cellular immunity./nIn 1895 Bordet made his discovery that the bacteriolytic effect of acquired specific antibody is significantly enhanced in vivo by the presence of innate serum components which he termed alexine (but which are now known as complement). Four years later, in 1899, he described a similar destructive process involving complement, \"hemolysis\", in which foreign red blood cells are ruptured or \"lysed\" following exposure to immune serum. In 1900, he left Paris to found an institute in Brussels like Pasteur's, and continued to work extensively on the mechanisms involved in the action of complement. These studies became the basis for complement-fixation testing methods that enabled the development of serological tests for syphilis (specifically, the development of the Wassermann test by August von Wassermann). The same technique is used today in serologic testing for countless other diseases./nWith Octave Gengou, he isolated Bordetella pertussis in pure culture in 1906 and posited it as the cause of whooping cough. He became Professor of Bacteriology at the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles in 1907./nIn March 1916, he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society[2] and in 1930, delivered their Croonian Lecture.[3] In this lecture, Bordet also concluded that bacteriophages, the bacteria-killing \"invisible viruses\" discovered by Felix d'Herelle did not exist and that bacteria destroyed themselves using a process of autolysis. This theory collapsed in 1941 with the publication by Ruska of the first electron microscope pictures of bacteriophages.[4] The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to him in 1919 for his discoveries relating to immunity./nBordet died in 1961 and was interred in the Ixelles Cemetery in Brussels./nThe Bordet railway station in Brussels is named after him./nThe cancer hospital Institut Jules Bordet is also named after him.", "52009954": "Jayant Bhalchandra Udgaonkar (born 1960) is an Indian biochemist, molecular biologist, and former professor of Biology[1] at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune[2][3] till March 2025.

Its eight 'revolutionary principles' are as follows:/n(All from Chishima, 1972)./nAs can be seen from Chishima's principles, neo-haematology effectively called for a rejection of significant established Biological theories such the mitotic theory of cellular division, whilst advocating a belief in the spontaneous generation of microbes and the belief that tissue elements can differentiate and retro-differentiate depending purely upon environmental conditions. Chishima also rejected the chromosome theory of heredity, and embraced a form of lamarckism in line with the Lysenkoite biologists in Russia at the time. \nChishima advocated a dialectical approach to addressing Biological problems, however he diverged sharply from his Soviet counterparts in that he rejected dialectical materialism in favor of what he termed Bio-dialectics, which incorporated spiritual elements into its framework. Much of the spiritual aspect of Chishima's work came from a desire on his part to reconcile the contradictions between Eastern and Western medicine./nNeo-haematology is based on discredited theories and ideas, so by today's standards and even by the standards of its day it has to be considered a pseudoscience, despite this however it still has a small following in America and Japan mostly amongst New Age medicine advocates./n1.

He was the first to introduce the pugmark methodology for the census of tigers in India, a technique he introduced while heading the first tiger census in India in 1972 which later became a popular method used all over India.[8] Based on his observations of Khairi and by maintaining a daily log of Khairi's movements,[15] he conducted research on the behaviour patterns of tigers, especially on the topic of pheromones,[3] which helped the later day research of R. L. Brahmachary on the subject.[8][16] He also introduced the use of tranquilizers for capturing wild tuskers.[2] His studies have been documented by way of several papers published in journals[1][17] and his autobiographical book, Khairi, The Beloved Tigress.[6]/nChoudhury had close ties with other conservationists such as Salim Ali, who supported the initiative to establish Khairi Wildlife Institute, which did not materialise, allegedly due to disinterestedness shown by the authorities.[18] The Government of India awarded him the civilian honour of Padma Shri in 1983.[7] Choudhury, did not survive Khairi for long,[10][12] after the tigress was euthanised by an overdose of tranquilizers when she contracted rabies from a dog bite.[13]", "40836099": "Jeffrey Connor Hall (born May 3, 1945) is an American geneticist and chronobiologist. Hall is Professor Emeritus of Biology at Brandeis University[2] and currently resides in Cambridge, Maine./nHall spent his career examining the neurological component of fly courtship and behavioral rhythms. Through his research on the neurology and behavior of Drosophila melanogaster, Hall uncovered essential mechanisms of the circadian clocks and shed light on the foundations for sexual differentiation in the nervous system.  He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences for his revolutionary work in the field of chronobiology, and nominated for the T. Washington Fellows[3]/nIn 2017, along with Michael W. Young and Michael Rosbash, he was awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for their discoveries of molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm\".[4][5]/nJeffrey Hall was born in Brooklyn, New York and raised in the suburbs of Washington D.C., while his father worked as a reporter for the Associated Press, covering the U.S. Senate. Hall's father, Joseph W. Hall,[6] greatly influenced him especially by encouraging Hall to stay updated on recent events in the daily newspaper. Hall attended Walter Johnson High School in Bethesda, Maryland, graduating in 1963.[7]  As a good high school student, Hall planned to pursue a career in medicine. Hall began pursuing a bachelor's degree at Amherst College in 1963. However, during his time as an undergraduate student, Hall found his passion in biology.[3] For his senior project, to gain experience in formal research, Hall began working with Philip Ives. Hall reported that Ives was one of the most influential people he encountered during his formative years.[8] Hall became fascinated with the study of Drosophila while working in Ives' lab, a passion that has permeated his research. Under the supervision of Ives, Hall studied recombination and translocation induction in Drosophila. The success of Hall's research pursuits prompted department faculty to recommend that Hall pursue graduate school at University of Washington in Seattle, where an entire department was devoted to genetics.[3]/nHall began working in Lawrence Sandler's laboratory during graduate school in 1967. Hall worked with Sandler on analyzing age-dependent enzyme changes in Drosophila, with a concentration on the genetic control of chromosome behavior in meiosis. Hershel Roman encouraged Hall to pursue postdoctoral work with Seymour Benzer, a pioneer in forward genetics, at the California Institute of Technology.[3] In an interview, Hall regarded Roman as an influential figure in his early career for Roman fostered camaraderie in the laboratory and guided nascent professionals.[8] Upon completing his doctoral work, Hall joined Benzer's laboratory in 1971. In Benzer's lab, Hall worked with Doug Kankel who taught Hall about Drosophila neuroanatomy and neurochemistry. Although Hall and Kankel made great progress on two projects, Hall left Benzer's laboratory before publishing results. In Hall's third year as a postdoctoral researcher, Roman contacted Hall regarding faculty positions that Roman had advocated for Hall. Hall joined Brandeis University as an Assistant Professor of Biology in 1974.[3] He is known for his eccentric lecturing style.[according to whom?]/nDuring his time working in the field of chronobiology, Hall faced many challenges when attempting to establish his findings.  Specifically, his genetic approach to biological clocks (see period gene section) was not easily accepted by more traditional chronobiologists.  When conducting his research on this particular topic, Hall faced skepticism when trying to establish the importance of a sequence of amino acids he isolated.  While working on this project the only other researcher working on a similar project was Michael Young.[3]/nHall not only faced hurdles when attempting to establish his own work, but also found the politics of research funding frustrating.  In fact these challenges are one of the primary reasons why he left the field.  He felt that the hierarchy and entry expectations of biology are preventing researchers from pursuing the research they desire.  Hall believed the focus should be on the individual's research; funding should not be a limiting factor on the scientist, but instead give them the flexibility to pursue new interests and hypotheses.  Hall expressed that he loves his research and flies, yet feels that the bureaucracy involved in the process prevented him from excelling and making new strides in the field.[8]/nHall's work with Drosophila courtship behavior began as a collaborative work with Kankel to correlate courtship behaviors with genetic sex in various regions of the nervous systems using fruit fly sex mosaics during the last months of his postdoctoral years in Benzer's laboratory. This work triggered his interest in the neurogenetics of Drosophila courtship and led him to the subsequent career path of investigation into Drosophila courtship.[3]/nIn the late 1970s, through a collaborative work with Florian von Schilcher, Hall successfully identified the nervous system regions in Drosophila that contributed to the regulation of male's courtship songs.[9] Hall realized from this study that courtship singing behavior was one of the elegantly quantifiable features of courtship and decided to study this topic further. In the subsequent research with a postdoctoral fellow in his lab, Bambos Kyriacou, Hall discovered that Drosophila courtship song was produced rhythmically with a normal period of about one minute.[3]/nSuspecting the period mutation for abnormal sleep-wake cycles\u2014generated by Ron Konopka in the late 1960s\u2014might also alter courtship song cycles, Hall and Kyriacou tested the effect of mutations in the period on courtship song.[3]  They found that period mutations affected the courtship song in the same way they changed the circadian rhythms. pers allele produced a shorter (approximately 40 second) oscillation, perl allele produced a longer (approximately 76 second) oscillation, and pero produced a song that had no regular oscillation.[10]/nIn his research, Hall mainly focused on flies with the fruitless gene, which he began studying during his postdoctoral years. The fruitless (fru) mutant was behaviorally sterile. Furthermore, they indiscriminately courted both females and males, but did not try to mate with either. This behavior was identified in the 1960s, but it had been neglected until Hall's group began to investigate the topic further. In the mid-1990s, through a collaborative work with Bruce Baker at Stanford University and Barbara Taylor at Stanford University, Hall successfully cloned fruitless. Through subsequent research with the cloned fruitless, Hall confirmed the previously suspected role of fruitless as the master regulator gene for courtship. By examining several fru mutations, Hall discovered that males performed little to no courtship toward females, failed to produce the pulse song component of courtship song, never attempted copulation, and exhibited increased inter-male courtship in the absence of FruM proteins.[11]/nHall worked primarily with Drosophila to study the mechanism of circadian rhythms. Rather than using the more traditional method of measuring eclosion, Hall measured locomotor activity of Drosophila to observe circadian rhythms.[12]/nIn 1990, while in collaboration with Michael Rosbash and Paul Hardin, Hall discovered that the Period protein (PER) played a role in suppressing its own transcription. While the exact role of PER was unknown, Hall, Rosbash, and Hardin were able to develop a negative transcription-translation feedback loop model (TTFL) that serves as a central mechanism of the circadian clock in Drosophila. In this original model, per expression led to an increase of PER. After a certain concentration of PER, the expression of per decreased, causing PER levels to decrease, once again allowing per to be expressed.[13]/nIn 1997, Hall was a part of group with Susan Renn, Jae Park, Michael Rosbash, and Paul Taghert that discovered genes that are a part of the TTFL are expressed in cells throughout the body. Despite these genes being identified as necessary genes to the circadian clock, there was a variety of levels of expressions in various parts of the body; this variation was observed on the cellular level. Hall succeeded in entraining separate tissues to different light-dark cycles at the same time. Hall didn't discover the element that synchronizes cells until 2003. He found that the pigment dispersing factor protein (PDF) helps control the circadian rhythms, and in turn locomotor activity, of these genes in cells. This was localized to small ventral lateral neurons (sLNvs) in the Drosophila brain. From this data, Hall concluded the sLNvs serve as the primary oscillator in Drosophila and PDF allows for synchrony between cells. He was awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology.[12][14]/nIn 1998, Hall contributed to two discoveries in Drosophila that refined the TTFL model. The first discovery involved the role Cryptochrome (CRY) plays in entrainment. Hall found that CRY is a key photoreceptor for both entrainment and regulation of locomotor activity.[15] He hypothesized CRY may not be just an input to the circadian system, but also a role as a pacemaker itself.  In the same year, Hall discovered how the Drosophila per and timeless (tim) circadian genes were regulated. Hall discovered that CLOCK and Cycle (CYC) proteins form a heterodimer via the PAS domain. Upon dimerizing, the two proteins bind to the E box promoter element of the two genes via the bHLH domain to induce expression of per and tim mRNA.[15]", "3152902": "Paul A. Nelson (born 1958) is an American philosopher, noted for his advocacy of the pseudosciences of young earth creationism and intelligent design.[1]/nNelson is the grandson of the creationist author and Lutheran minister Byron Christopher Nelson (1894\u20131972) and edited a book of his grandfather's writings.[2]  He is married to Suzanne Nelson, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University./nIn 1998, Nelson gained a PhD in philosophy from the University of Chicago./nNelson is a fellow of the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture and of the International Society for Complexity, Information and Design./nThe Discovery Institute's Wedge Document,[3] and other sources have said that Nelson publishes works derived from his dissertation, \"Common Descent, Generative Entrenchment, and the Epistemology in Evolutionary Inference\", in which he criticizes the principle of common descent as it is expounded in the Evolutionary Monographs series./nNelson is frequently cited by opponents of intelligent design as an example of ID's \"big tent\" strategy in action. He has written about \"Life in the Big Tent\" in the Christian Research Journal.[4] In an interview for Touchstone Magazine Nelson said that the main challenge facing the ID community was to \"develop a full-fledged theory of biological design\", and that the lack of such a theory was a \"real problem\".[5]/nAs shown in the Peabody Award-winning documentary Nova: Intelligent Design on Trial, in the Kitzmiller v. Dover trial, Barbara Forrest presented a quote from Nelson to demonstrate that Intelligent Design proponents know that it is not a theory in the scientific sense:/nEasily, the biggest challenge facing the I.D. community is to develop a full-fledged theory of biological design. We don't have such a theory right now, and that's a real problem. Without a theory, it's very hard to know where to direct your research focus. Right now, we've got a bag of powerful intuitions and a handful of notions, such as irreducible complexity, but as yet, no general theory of biological design./nNelson was a contributor to the book Three Views on Creation and Evolution, edited by J. P. Moreland and John Mark Reynolds, in which he, along with Reynolds, represented the young Earth creationist position. In their discussion in that book he and Reynolds acknowledged that \"natural science at the moment seems to overwhelmingly point to an old cosmos.\"[6] Ideas consistent with present-day Young Earth creationism were abandoned around the start of the 19th century.[7] Today, such proposals are rejected by the scientific community,[8] and the courts have ruled Young Earth creationism to be a religious belief.[9]/nIn a discussion with historian of science Ronald Numbers, Nelson made a distinction between his theological understanding of Earth history, which is informed by the biblical account as presented in the book of Genesis, and his advocacy for intelligent design. Nelson acknowledged that his young-Earth views are unpopular with many other intelligent design advocates.[10]/nNelson was a cast member in the 2017 creationist documentary film Is Genesis History?.[11] After the film's release, he published an article stating that the film distorted his arguments and presented \"a false dichotomy\" between naturalistic evolution and young Earth creationism while omitting other viewpoints.[12] Director and Producer Thomas Purifoy wrote a response entitled A Tale of Two Dichotomies in which he presented the full film interview with Nelson as evidence and stated that \"as a philosopher, Paul seemed to be shifting back to viewing things from a philosophical perspective. The film, however, was not about comparing two different philosophies, but two different\u00a0histories.\"[13]", "47193102": "John M Baxter is a Scottish marine biologist and was (now retired) the Principal Adviser - Marine for Scottish Natural Heritage.[1]  He is the chief editor (marine) for the international journal Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems.[2]/nWith Scottish Natural Heritage, Baxter was  involved with the delivery of numerous policy initiatives including the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010 requirements to designate Marine Protected Areas, the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive and Habitats Directive.[1]  He is a member of several advisory groups including the MASTS International Advisory Committee, the Special Committee on Seals and MarLIN Steering Group.[1]/nHe is a Trustee of the Scottish Seabird Centre, a marine conservation and education charity which is based in North Berwick, East Lothian./nBaxter works with various marine climate change groups to provide scientific evidence and advice to politicians and policy makers, including The MarClim Survey in Scotland, he is chair of the expert advisory panel for the UK Marine Climate Change Impacts Partnership and vice-chair of the Ocean Acidification - International Reference User Group.[3]  Baxter is also a trustee at the Scottish Seabird Centre in North Berwick.[4]/nBaxter has published numerous papers and was co-editor of Scotland's Marine Atlas.[3][5]/nIn 2014 he became an honorary professor at the University of St Andrews and Heriot-Watt University.[1][6]/n/nThis article about a biologist from Scotland is a stub.

In particular, Picotti works in proteomics, the large scale analysis of thousands of proteins at a given moment. Whilst proteomics offers the potential for wide-reaching analysis, detail is lost because of a lack of information about the specific proteins themselves.[5]/nPicotti pioneered the combination of limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry (so-called \"LiP-MS\"), which generates a structural barcode (a proteolytic fingerprint) for sentinel proteins.[6][5] Sentinel proteins are proteins whose biological markers change depending on the activation state of a cellular process.[7] By analysing literature for sentinels that were involved in diverse yeast pathways, Picotti identified a few hundred that she could measure using an assay.[5] She has shown that this technique can be used to unravel the thermosensitivity of proteins, as well as used it to realise a map of protein-metabolite interactions.[6] LiP-MS can monitor for the conformational change of proteins in complex environments, allowing for the visualisation of the dynamic 3D proteomes. She has since used LiP-MS to study protein aggregation in neurodegenerative disease.[8]", "27794457": "Don Wayne Fawcett (March 14, 1917 - May 7, 2009) was a pioneer of electron microscopy and one of its greatest practitioners for studying the organization of cells and tissues. His greatest achievement was his description of the structure of spermatozoa and the male reproductive system./nDon Fawcett was born in 1917 on a farm in Iowa, where his father and grandfather had raised purebred sheep and cattle until his father's poor health forced the family to leave the farm and move to Boston, where Fawcett's father managed a successful wool business. Fawcett attended high school at the Boston Latin School. Upon graduation, he matriculated at Harvard College in 1934, followed by Harvard Medical School in 1938, where he connected with anatomy professor George B. Wislocki. \"I stole as much time as I could from my course work to do independent research on projects that included studies on the vascular bundles of aquatic mammals, and the amedullary bones[1] of the Florida manatee\", he recalled./nWhile in college, Fawcett illustrated a book on athletic bandaging that had been written by the football team's physician. This may have been his only contribution as an illustrator; his later and more widely popular books were illustrated by Sylvia Collard Keen. In the summers, Fawcett worked on Bailey Island off the coast of Maine, where he embalmed and prepared small sharks for sale to colleges for comparative anatomy courses. This early interest in anatomy served him well when he trained in surgery at Harvard. Fawcett's predominant memory of his clinical training was being on duty in the emergency ward the night of the infamous Cocoanut Grove Nightclub disaster of 1942, which claimed 492 lives in one of the deadliest fires in American history. \"We had been having a quiet evening when, without advance notice, we received 115 seriously burned patients within an hour and a half. Mobilizing all of the off-duty staff that I could reach, I continued on duty for 30 hours doing all I could to relieve the pain and dress the burns of the victims.\" He received his M.D. in 1942./nFawcett served as a battalion surgeon and captain in the European Theater of World War II, but, before shipping out, he married Dorothy Secrest Fawcett, his wife for 68 years, who survived him. After the war, Fawcett chose a career in research instead of surgery. He returned to Harvard, where he served as an instructor./nFawcett perfected the art and technology of microscopy in the early days of cell biology, which emerged as a modern field after the electron microscope became more widely available in the 1940s. He would routinely cut thin sections at home, before venturing in the early morning hours to his lab at Harvard, where he viewed them with the microscope that would do so much to reveal the secrets of form and function. He kept a microtome at home, and it was rumored that he also had a private collection of diamond knives to help achieve his unparalleled results./nTom Pollard, a student at Harvard during Fawcett's chairmanship, recalls how Fawcett used his skills in the darkroom to produce spectacular prints of electron micrographs to illustrate the key features of each image. He may have been most renowned as the first person to describe and depict in detail human spermatozoa, and he published extensively on the anatomy of male reproductive cellular anatomy./nHe sought out Keith Porter, another pioneering electron microscopist, at the Rockefeller Institute. There, with Porter and George E. Palade, Fawcett recalled in 2000 that he, working with his illustrious colleagues, \"undertook a project on the fine structure of ciliated epithelium that revealed the 9+2 pattern of microtubules in the cilia for the first time in a metazoan.\"/nFawcett described the early days of electron microscopy as: \"For morphologists the decade from 1950 to 1960 held the same anticipation and excitement that attends the opening of a new continent for exploration. The electron microscope revealed marvelous order and functional design in the organization of every tissue and organ that was examined and added significantly to our understanding of our own structure (...)\". Fawcett published a collection of his fine-structure micrographs in The Cell, a classic cell biology text that features all the major cell structures,[2]/nIn 1955 Fawcett assumed the position of chair of the Department of Anatomy at Cornell Medical School in New York City and established an electron microscope laboratory. He had become what today might be characterized as the quintessential descriptive scientist; later generations of cell biologists and biochemists would build on his seminal work. After four years at Cornell, Fawcett again returned to Harvard as Hersey Professor of Anatomy and Chairman of the Department. The endowment for his chairmanship had been established by Ezekiel Hersey in 1770 with a gift of 1,000 pounds, and, Fawcett recalled, \"My salary reflected the size of that endowment.\"/nFawcett, together with Keith Porter, Montrose Moses, Morgan Harris, Hans Ris, Hewson Swift, and J. Herbert Taylor, founded the American Society for Cell Biology in 1960, and was elected as its first president in 1961. They charged themselves with organizing the inaugural scientific meeting of the embryonic society in Chicago where Fawcett was elected its first president.  In 1972, Fawcett was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences.[3]/nIn 1976 Fawcett resigned the chairmanship and became Senior Associate Dean for Preclinical Science, a position for which, by his own description, he was ill-suited. After spending some time annually in Africa as examiner in the School of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Nairobi, Kenya, where he indulged his profound love of and talent for animal and nature photography, Fawcett left Boston in 1985 to take the position of senior research scientist and director of electron microscopy at the International Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases in Nairobi. There, he worked in parasitology in a well-equipped laboratory financed by the World Bank and other international agencies. Its mission was to find methods of controlling two parasitic diseases, theileriosis (also known as East Coast Fever) and trypanosomiasis, which together killed hundreds of thousands of cattle annually in East and Central Africa. Fawcett relished the freedom from administrative duties that he enjoyed there. With just a small German microscope and all the accessories he needed, Fawcett could devote all his energy to studying what he considered an interesting new field. He found that he was able to \"add significantly to what was then known about the parasites and their arachnid and dipteran vectors.\"/nIn 1981, Fawcett became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.[4]/nFawcett is the author of The Cell, a classic cell biology text,[2] and was the author of several editions of Bloom and Fawcett: A Textbook of Histology, the definitive histology textbook to generations of students.[5]\nHe published over 200 papers on the ultrastructure of cells and organelles./nWhen Fawcett retired from his work in Africa, he and Dorothy established a new home in Montana in 1988, because the rural environment suited them and they wanted to be close to family./nDespite his leadership roles, Fawcett was uncommonly solitary in his work and private in his personal life./nSimilarly, in later years, though Fawcett was devoted to his and Dorothy's four children (Robert, Mary, Dona, and Joseph) his colleagues cannot recall ever meeting them. A contributing factor may have been that Fawcett suffered profoundly from migraine headaches, which he did not reveal to his colleagues and for which he delayed seeking treatment for many decades\u2014a choice that may have caused him to withdraw for hours of silent endurance\u2014until he finally agreed to seek medical attention./nFawcett died at his home in Missoula, Montana on May 7, 2009, at the age of 92./nHis greatest professional legacy, according to Harvard colleague Dan Goodenough, may have been his talent for identifying and recruiting young talent, including Susumu Ito, Betty Hay (who succeeded him as Chair of Anatomy at Harvard and later as President of the ASCB), and Jean-Paul Revel, also to become an ASCB president. Fawcett recruited dozens of postdoctoral fellows, many of whom also went on to become leaders of cell biology. He \"guided\" his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s by procuring for them modest start-up funds, finding them a lab or bench, and wishing them well. They were left completely free to pursue their own research questions alone or through other relationships they may have developed./nGoodenough describes him as \"fair, generous, and austere,\" recounting how Fawcett encouraged his early interest in black-and-white photography at a time when Goodenough was a graduate student and couldn't even dream of purchasing good equipment. Fawcett unhesitatingly lent him his fine cameras, lenses, and darkroom equipment. Yet, Fawcett never failed to greet a young faculty member to Harvard with the admonition that they had not a prayer of being asked to stay on the senior faculty./nTom Pollard, the chair of Cell Biology and Anatomy at Johns Hopkins for many years and now at Yale, says that Fawcett \"changed my life.\" Pollard describes how, after accepting a neurology residency at University of California, San Francisco, Fawcett, who had attended a talk that Pollard had given as a medical student, called him and asked him to consider basic science instead. Pollard rerouted back to Harvard, where Fawcett gave him a princely start-up fund of US$500 and left him to follow his curiosity./nIn 1988, the Fawcett Lecture was established at Harvard Medical School in Fawcett's honor.", "4561949": "Melissa G.

She dedicated her career to applying the evolving computational technologies to support advances in biology and medicine, most notably the creation of protein and nucleic acid databases and tools to interrogate the databases.  She originated one of the first substitution matrices, point accepted mutations (PAM). The one-letter code used for amino acids was developed by her, reflecting an attempt to reduce the size of the data files used to describe amino acid sequences in an era of punch-card computing./nHer PhD degree was from Columbia University in the department of chemistry, where she devised computational methods to calculate molecular resonance energies of several organic compounds.  She did postdoctoral studies at the Rockefeller Institute (now Rockefeller University) and the University of Maryland, and joined the newly established National Biomedical Research Foundation in 1959. She was the first woman to hold office in the Biophysical Society and the first person to serve as both secretary and eventually president.[2]/nDayhoff was born an only child in Philadelphia, but moved to New York City when she was ten.[3] Her academic promise was evident from the outset\u00a0\u2013 she was valedictorian (class of 1942) at Bayside High School, Bayside, New York, and from there received a scholarship to Washington Square College of New York University, graduating magna cum laude in mathematics in 1945 and getting elected to Phi Beta Kappa.[4][5]/nDayhoff began a PhD in quantum chemistry under George Kimball in the Columbia University Department of Chemistry. In her graduate thesis, Dayhoff pioneered the use of computer capabilities\u00a0\u2013 i.e. mass-data processing\u00a0\u2013 to theoretical chemistry; specifically, she devised a method of applying punched-card business machines to calculate the resonance energies of several polycyclic organic molecules. Her management of her research data was so impressive that she was awarded a Watson Computing Laboratory Fellowship. As part of this award, she received access to \"cutting-edge IBM electronic data processing equipment\" at the lab.[6][7]/nAfter completing her PhD, Dayhoff studied electrochemistry under Duncan A. MacInnes at the Rockefeller Institute from 1948 to 1951. In 1952, she moved to Maryland with her family and later received research fellowships from the University of Maryland (1957\u20131959), working on a model of chemical bonding with Ellis Lippincott. At Maryland, she gained her first exposure to a new high-speed computer, the IBM model 7094. After this ended, she joined the National Biomedical Research Foundation in 1960 as associate director (a position she held for 21 years).[5] At the NBRF, she began to work with Robert Ledley, a dentist who had obtained a degree in physics and become interested in the possibilities of applying computational resources to biomedical problems. He had authored one of the earliest studies of biomedical computation, \"Report on the Use of Computer in Biology and Medicine.\"[8] With their combined expertise, they published a paper in 1962 entitled \"COMPROTEIN: A computer program to aid primary protein structure determination\" that described a \"completed computer program for the IBM 7090\" that aimed to convert peptide digests to protein chain data. They actually began this work in 1958, but were not able to start programming until late 1960.[8]/nIn the early 1960s, Dayhoff also collaborated with Ellis Lippincott and Carl Sagan to develop thermodynamic models of cosmo-chemical systems, including prebiological planetary atmospheres.  She developed a computer program that could calculate equilibrium concentrations of the gases in a planetary atmosphere, enabling the study of the atmospheres of Venus, Jupiter, and Mars, in addition to the present day atmosphere and the primordial terrestrial atmosphere. Using this program, she considered whether the primordial atmosphere had the conditions necessary to generate life. Although she found that numerous small biologically important compounds can appear with no special nonequilibrium mechanism to explain their presence, there were compounds necessary to life that were scarce in the equilibrium model (such as ribose, adenine, and cytosine).[2]/nDayhoff also taught physiology and biophysics at Georgetown University Medical Center for 13 years, served as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and was elected councillor of the International Society for the Study of the Origins of Life in 1980 after 8 years of membership. Dayhoff also served on the editorial boards of three journals: DNA, Journal of Molecular Evolution and Computers in Biology and Medicine.[2]/nIn 1966, Dayhoff pioneered the use of computers in comparing protein sequences and reconstructing their evolutionary histories from sequence alignments. To perform this work, she created the single-letter amino acid code to minimize the data file size for each sequence. This work, co-authored with Richard Eck, was the first application of computers to infer phylogenies from molecular sequences. It was the first reconstruction of a phylogeny (evolutionary tree) by computers from molecular sequences using a maximum parsimony method. In later years, she applied these methods to study a number of molecular relationships, such as the catalytic chain and bovine cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and the src gene product of Rous avian and Moloney murine sarcoma viruses; antithrombin-III, alpha-antitrypsin, and ovalbumin; epidermal growth factor and the light chain of coagulation factor X; and apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, C-I and C-III.[2]/nBased on this work, Dayhoff and her coworkers developed a set of substitution matrices called the PAM (Percent Accepted Mutation), MDM (Mutation Data Matrix), or Dayhoff Matrix. They are derived from global alignments of closely related protein sequences. The identification number included with the matrix (ex. PAM40, PAM100) refers to the evolutionary distance; greater numbers correspond to greater distances. Matrices using greater evolutionary distances are extrapolated from those used for lesser ones.[9] To produce a Dayhoff matrix, pairs of aligned amino acids in verified alignments are used to build a count matrix, which is then used to estimate at mutation matrix at 1 PAM (considered an evolutionary unit). From this mutation matrix, a Dayhoff scoring matrix may be constructed. Along with a model of indel events, alignments generated by these methods can be used in an iterative process to construct new count matrices until convergence.[10]/nOne of Dayhoff's most important contributions to bioinformatics was her Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, a book reporting all known protein sequences (totaling 65) that she published in 1965.[11] This book published a degenerate encoding of amino acids. It was subsequently republished in several editions.  This led to the Protein Information Resource database of protein sequences, the first online database system that could be accessed by telephone line and available for interrogation by remote computers.[12] The book has since been cited nearly 4,500 times.[2] It and the parallel effort by Walter Goad which led to the GenBank database of nucleic acid sequences are the twin origins of the modern databases of molecular sequences.  The Atlas was organized by gene families, and she is regarded as a pioneer in their recognition. Frederick Sanger's determination of the first complete amino acid sequence of a protein (insulin) in 1955, led a number of researchers to sequence various proteins from different species. In the early 1960s, a theory was developed that small differences between homologous protein sequences (sequences with a high likelihood of common ancestry) could indicate the process and rate of evolutionary change on the molecular level. The notion that such molecular analysis could help scientists decode evolutionary patterns in organisms was formalized in the published papers of Emile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling in 1962 and 1965./nDavid Lipman, director of the National Center for Biotechnology Information, has called Dayhoff the \"mother and father of bioinformatics\".[13]/nDayhoff's husband was Edward S. Dayhoff, an experimental physicist who worked with magnetic resonance and with lasers.[14] They had two daughters who are also academics, Ruth and Judith.[15]/nJudith Dayhoff has a Mathematical Biophysics PhD from University of Pennsylvania and is the author of Neural network architectures: An introduction and coauthor of Neural Networks and Pattern Recognition.[15][16][17][18]/nRuth Dayhoff graduated summa cum laude in Mathematics from the University of Maryland and focused on Medical Informatics while doing her MD at Georgetown University School of Medicine.[14] During medical school, she co-authored a paper and a chapter in The Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure with her mother, describing a new way to measure how closely proteins are related.[14] Her husband Vincent Brannigan is Professor Emeritus of Law and Technology at the University of Maryland School of Engineering. Ruth was a founding Fellow of the American College of Medical Informatics.  She pioneered the integration of Medical Imaging and invented the Vista Imaging System.  She was chosen for the National Library of Medicine's project on the 200 women Physicians who \"changed the face of medicine.\"[14] She serves as director of Digital Imaging in Medicine for the United States Department of Veteran's Affairs.[5]/nDayhoff's Atlas became a template for many indispensable tools in large portions of DNA or protein-related biomedical research. In spite of this significant contribution, Dayhoff was marginalized by the community of sequencers. The contract to manage GenBank (a technology directly related to her research), awarded in the early 1980s by the NIH, went to Walter Goad at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The reason for this attitude was unknown, with theories ranging from sexism to a clash of values with the experimental science community.[19] Despite the success of Dayhoff's Atlas, experimental scientists and researchers considered their sequence information very valuable and were often reluctant to submit it to such a publicly available database.[20]/nDuring the last few years of her life, she focused on obtaining stable, adequate, long-term funding to support the maintenance and further development of her Protein Information Resource. She envisioned an online system of computer programs and databases, accessible by scientists all over the world, for identifying protein from sequence or amino acid composition data, for making predictions based on sequences, and for browsing the known information. Less than a week before she died, she submitted a proposal to the Division of Research Resources at NIH for a Protein Identification Resource. After her death, her colleagues worked to make her vision a reality, and the protein database was fully operational by the middle of 1984.[2]/nDayhoff died of a heart attack at the age of 57 on February 5, 1983.[3] A fund was established after her death in 1984 to endow the Margaret O. Dayhoff Award, one of the top national honors in biophysics. The award is presented to a woman who \"holds very high promise or has achieved prominence while developing the early stages of a career in biophysical research within the purview and interest of the Biophysical Society.\"[21] It is presented at the annual meeting of the Biophysical Society and includes an honorarium of $2,000./nShe was survived by her husband, Edward S. Dayhoff of Silver Spring; two daughters, Ruth E. Dayhoff Brannigan of College Park, and Judith E. Dayhoff of Silver Spring, and her father, Kenneth W. Oakley of Silver Spring.[5]/nHer seminal contributions as the mother of the science of bioinformatics, now routinely used as part of the process for naming bacteria, were acknowledged with a bacterium being named after her in 2020, Enemella dayhoffiae.[22]", "1481776": "Walther Flemming (21 April 1843 \u2013 4 August 1905) was a German biologist and a founder of cytogenetics./nHe was born in Sachsenberg (now part of Schwerin) as the fifth child and only son of the psychiatrist Carl Friedrich Flemming (1799\u20131880) and his second wife, Auguste Winter. He  graduated from the Gymnasium der Residenzstadt, where one of his colleagues and lifelong friends was writer Heinrich Seidel./nFlemming trained in medicine at the University of Prague, graduating in 1868. Afterwards, he served in 1870\u201371 as a military physician in the Franco-Prussian War. From 1873 to 1876 he worked as a teacher at the University of Prague. In 1876 he accepted a post as a professor of anatomy at the University of Kiel. He became the director of the Anatomical Institute and stayed there until his death./nWith the use of aniline dyes he was able to find a structure[where?] which strongly absorbed basophilic dyes, which he named chromatin. He identified that chromatin was correlated to threadlike structures in the cell nucleus \u2013 the chromosomes (meaning coloured bodies), which were named thus later by German anatomist Wilhelm von Waldeyer-Hartz (1841\u20131923). The Belgian scientist Edouard Van Beneden (1846\u20131910) had also observed them, independently. The centrosome was discovered jointly by Walther Flemming in 1875 [1][2] and Edouard Van Beneden in 1876.[3][4]/nFlemming investigated the process of cell division and the distribution of chromosomes to the daughter nuclei, a process he called mitosis from the Greek word for thread. However, he did not see the splitting into identical halves, the daughter chromatids. He studied mitosis both in vivo and in stained preparations, using as the source of biological material the fins and gills of salamanders. These results were published first in 1878[5] and in 1882 in the seminal book Zellsubstanz, Kern und Zelltheilung (1882; Cell substance, nucleus and cell division). On the basis of his discoveries, Flemming surmised for the first time that all cell nuclei came from another predecessor nucleus (he coined the phrase omnis nucleus e nucleo, after Virchow's omnis cellula e cellula)./nFlemming is also known for his philanthropy. He weekly fed those who were homeless, donating every year, 20% of his salary to homeless shelters. He taught especially young children who were too poor to attend school about mathematics and science./nFlemming was unaware of the work of Gregor Mendel (1822\u201384) on heredity, so he did not make the connection between his observations and genetic inheritance. Two decades would pass before the significance of Flemming's work was truly realized with the rediscovery of Mendel's rules. The Science Channel named Flemming's discovery of mitosis and chromosomes as one of the 100 most important scientific discoveries of all time, and one of the 10 most important discoveries in cell biology.[6]/nFlemming's name is honoured by a medal awarded by the German Society for Cell Biology (Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Zellbiologie).[7]", "64461876": "Barbara Helen Tedlock (born September 9, 1942- September 11,2023) was an American cultural anthropologist and oneirologist. She was a Distinguished Professor of Anthropology at the State University of New York, Buffalo.

The collection featured cultural perspectives that challenge the typical Western conception of dreaming as a phenomenon existing completely separate from objective reality.[4]/nTedlock examined how linguistic conventions mediate the performance and interpretation of dream experience. She explored how communications about dreams reveal patterns and variations around how different cultures perceive the role and significance of dreaming. For example, the K\u02bciche\u02bc Maya people use the first-person pronoun \"I\" to narrate dreams with the understanding that this \"I\" does not necessarily relate to the conscious self of the dream teller. Likewise, the use of third person pronouns, particularly in relating negative dreams, communicates distance between the dream teller and the experience of the dream self.[5]/nTedlock rejected the existence of any hard boundary between anthropologist and the peoples with whom they interact in the field. She advocated for narrative ethnography as a methodological innovation that honored and more accurately represented the intertwining, interdependent relationship between anthropologist and the subjects of their research.[6]/nFrom 1993 to 1997, Tedlock, with collaborator and husband Dennis Tedlock, edited American Anthropologist, the American Anthropological Association's flagship journal.[7] In 1998, she became the chair of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Buffalo.[3] Tedlock serves on the Anthropology and Humanism advisory board.[8]/nTime and the Highland Maya (1992)[9]/nThe Beautiful and the Dangerous: Encounters with the Zuni Indians (2001)[10]/nThe Woman in the Shaman's Body: Reclaiming the Feminine in Religion and Medicine.

She made diploids which she used to demonstrate for the first time that hyphal fusion, nuclear migration, the formation of a dikaryon ending in sexual reproduction are all controlled by a positive stimulus triggered by the meeting of unlike alleles of the A and B factors. This is in contrast to the oppositional inhibition of the final stages of sexual reproduction by the meeting of like alleles in flowering plants. Using elegant genetic and molecular techniques with different genetic stocks including gene deletions and gene fusions, she has shown that the A factor is a supergene of several multiallelic genes encoding proteins with homeodomains binding to DNA. These trigger sexual development by the association of A proteins with different homeodomains sequences (HD1 and HD2). A factors contain several duplicate genes coding for the A protein but it is only necessary for any one of these genes to be allelic unmatched to trigger the whole sexual development. Other domains characteristic of transcription factors found in mammalian cells suggest that helical regions adjacent to the homeodomain may discriminate between compatible and incompatible protein associations.[19]/nThe British Mycological Society awarded her an Honorary Membership in 2002.[10]", "67050558": "Natasha Mhatre is a researcher in Canada at Western University whose research focuses on animal communication.[1] Focusing on insect biomechanics,[2] she is an assistant professor and NSERC Canada Research Chair in invertebrate neurobiology.[3]/nMhatre earned her Bachelor of Science from Mumbai University in 1999, and her Master of Science and doctorate from the Indian Institute of Science in 2002 and 2008, respectively.[4]/nMhatre's work has covered insect communication and biomechanics.

At her parents' suggestion, she attended University of Oregon with intentions on following in her brother's footsteps to apply to law school. Her sophomore year, Dasso held a summer position in Pete H. von Hippel's laboratory where she studied the function of T4 DNA polymerase, which is now commonly used by researchers to mutate genes of interest and conduct DNA-related studies.

Years earlier, Nishimoto had shown that cells without the RCC1 protein attempted to divide before completing DNA replication, resulting in catastrophic damage to chromosomes; he also identified the gene, RCC1, that made the protein. Nishimoto first sent a postdoctoral researcher, Hideo Nishitani, to conduct RCC1 experiments in Newport's lab at UCSD. Then, Dasso went to Japan to complete more experiments.

They further demonstrated that other components of the nuclear transport machinery are similarly re-purposed as cells divide to perform transport-independent activities that are essential for accurate chromosome segregation. In particular, nuclear pore complex proteins, called nucleoporins, localize to mitotic spindles and kinetochores; this localization is essential for proper spindle assembly and cell cycle progression.[5][2]/nDasso's group has developed CRISPR-based strategies for selective degradation of individual nucleoporins.

Created by writer Roy Thomas and originally designed by penciler Gil Kane, he debuted as a tragic, sympathetic adversary of the superhero Spider-Man in The Amazing Spider-Man #101 (October 1971).[1] For years, Morbius frequently clashed with Spider-Man and other superheroes while occasionally regaining his reason and helping those he regarded as allies. The 1992 Marvel Comics \"Rise of the Midnight Sons\" crossover event then revived and revised several horror-themed Marvel characters to present them as lead protagonists in new titles. The event launched the new series Morbius the Living Vampire, which ran from 1992 to 1995 and now presented the title character as a lethal anti-hero and vigilante. After the cancellation of this series, various stories shifted back and forth between portraying Morbius as a conflicted and brutal anti-hero or a tragic character subject to episodes of madness and murder (once again, most often fighting Spider-Man)./nMichael Morbius is depicted as a famous biochemist who contracts a rare blood disease which he then tries to cure by using a combination of experimental chemicals, electroshock therapy, and genetic samples of vampire bats. The experiment mutates him into a \"pseudo-vampire\" or \"living vampire\", a life form with abilities and traits resembling, but not identical to, those of truly supernatural and \"undead\" creatures such as vampires (which exist in the Marvel Universe).[2] To keep his blood disease in remission, Morbius must now regularly feed on fresh human blood or face rapid illness followed by death. Initially, Morbius's mutation affects his ability to reason while experiencing hunger. This leads to blackouts and acts of violence that result in murder and villainy, occasionally followed by lucid periods during which he regrets causing harm.[2] A mixture of electricity and Spider-Man's blood restores his humanity for several years, but he later reverts to being a pseudo-vampire. During the \"Rise of the Midnight Sons\", a mixture of poison and genuine demon blood alters Morbius' physiology slightly while also restoring his mental capacity, allowing him greater control and awareness even while experiencing bloodlust. A new \"anti-viral\" serum involving Spider-Man's blood also allows him to regain humanity for hours at a time.[3][4] Concluding he now has greater control over his condition and wishing to regain some semblance of a normal life, Morbius creates a new cover identity of Dr. Morgan Michaels, while at night secretly acting as a lethal vigilante who only feeds on \"the blood of the guilty.\" Later on, another mutagenic serum saves his life but results in Morbius once again being vulnerable to temporary madness and a loss of his faculties when his bloodlust is too strong. As a result, he abandons his Morgan Michaels identity and becomes a fugitive again.[5]/nThe character has appeared in several media adaptations outside of comics. In the 1990s animated series Spider-Man, Morbius is a recurring character voiced by Nick Jameson. In contrast to the comics, the cartoon depicted Morbius both as a regular ally of the character Blade and as a being who feeds on human plasma through his hands rather than with his fangs. Jared Leto portrayed Michael Morbius in the Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) live-action feature film Morbius (2022), with Matt Smith co-starring as Milo, a composite character also based on Morbius and several other characters./nMorbius debuted in The Amazing Spider-Man #101 (published in August 1971 and cover dated October 1971). His creation followed the comic book industry's self-censorship board, the Comics Code Authority, updating its policies in February 1971, which included lifting a ban on comic book stories depicting vampires and certain other supernatural characters.[6] Morbius' introduction was the first issue of Marvel Comics' flagship Spider-Man series written by someone other than character co-creator and then editor-in-chief Stan Lee, who was busy writing a screenplay for an unproduced science fiction movie.[7] Lee bequeathed the role of series writer to his right-hand editor Roy Thomas./nIn 2009, Roy Thomas said there was interest in having the company's flagship character Spider-Man fight a vampire, possibly even the famous Count Dracula. \"We were talking about doing Dracula, but Stan wanted a costumed villain. Other than that, he didn't specify what we should do.\" Thomas added that part of the character conception came from the 1957 film The Vampire, a science fiction film he saw in his youth that depicted a man turned into a vampire by radiation rather than magic.[8] Thomas and penciller Gil Kane then discussed and created the character together, deciding it was more appropriate for the science-fiction based Spider-Man to fight a villain given pseudo-vampiric traits via scientific rather than supernatural means.[9] Kane based the character's look on that of actor Jack Palance.[10] Thomas said the name \"Morbius\" was not deliberately taken from the antagonist Doctor Morbius in the 1956 film Forbidden Planet.[7] The initial two-story arc emphasized that Morbius, like other Spider-Man villains such as the Lizard, was not truly a malicious villain but a tragic and sympathetic character who had unwittingly been changed into a monster, in this case as a result of trying to cure his own rare but fatal blood disease. The story also introduced Morbius' lover Martine Bancroft and revealed that his first victim had been his scientific colleague and best friend Emil Nikos. Later on, Giant-Size Spider-Man #1 (July 1974) did depict Spider-Man and Dracula together in a story, but the two characters only briefly cross paths while unaware of each other's true nature./nAfter their initial meeting, Morbius collided again with Spider-Man in Marvel Team-Up #3\u20134 (July \u2013 September 1972) and the one-shot Giant-Size Super-Heroes #1 (June 1974). Morbius went on to star in Vampire Tales, a black-and-white horror comics magazine published by Marvel's sister company, Curtis Magazines, appearing in all but two of the mature audience title's 11 issues (August 1973 \u2013 June 1975).[11] The first Morbius solo story was written by Steve Gerber, while the rest of the stories, save for the last three, were written by Don McGregor, with penciling by Rich Buckler and by Tom Sutton, primarily. These stories focused on Morbius as more of a tragic anti-hero, one subject to blackouts and violence but who could also act altruistically towards allies and those he saw as victims of unjust circumstances./nAfter his first two Vampire Tales stories, Morbius concurrently became the star of his own feature in Marvel's bimonthly Adventure into Fear anthology series, beginning with issue #20 (February 1974) and continuing through issue #31 (December 1975), the last issue of the series.[12] These were written, successively, by Mike Friedrich, Steve Gerber, Doug Moench and Bill Mantlo, working with a wide variety of pencillers./nMorbius was then seen as a tragic figure lamenting his past and willing to stand trial for his actions in The Savage She-Hulk #9\u201312 and 25.[13] These stories also showed him willing to lend his expertise to help others who suffered from a mutation or \"curse\" they did not choose. This continued when Morbius is seen researching the condition of the Werewolf (Jack Russell) in West Coast Avengers (vol. 2) #5.[14]/nFollowing sporadic appearances as a villain throughout the next 16 years, Morbius was retooled as part of the 1992 \"Rise of the Midnight Sons\" crossover event, the purpose of which was to launch a new line of horror- and supernatural-themed comics following the success of Ghost Rider (vol. 3). \"Rise of the Midnight Sons\" featured the new Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch) and Johnny Blaze (the previous Ghost Rider) seeking out the \"Midnight Sons\", different unique individuals who would eventually be crucial to stopping the demonic Lilith from laying waste to humanity (as well as potentially other threats just as great). This led directly into the new series Morbius the Living Vampire, which would run for 32 issues (September 1992 \u2013 April 1995). Morbius the Living Vampire #1 showed the title character being mutated further, which altered his abilities slightly, revealed he had untapped \"psionic\" power, and gave him a more rational, introspective nature. Morbius takes on the role of a lethal vigilante, vowing only to feed on killers who are truly evil and beyond remorse.[4]  The next month, Morbius the Living Vampire #2 retroactively explained much of the Living Vampire's villainy in the past as the result of his initial mutation altering his brain and making him \"insane\", a condition now alleviated with his latest mutation. Morbius also discovers that his blood disease is no longer in remission and is slowly killing him. This introduces an ongoing series sub-plot wherein Morbius and his trusted friend Dr. Jacob Weisenthal regularly research treatments and anti-viral serums that may put his disease and his condition as a living vampire both into remission. With his ability to reason restored and his newfound purpose as a vigilante rather than a villain, Morbius is seen creating a new cover identity for himself, that of human hematologist Dr. Morgan Michaels./nRather than only pitting Morbius against Marvel heroes or previously established villains as had been done in the past, new enemies were introduced and created specifically to fight the Living Vampire. These included Dr. Thaddeus Paine,[15] the Basilisk II (Wayne Gifford),[16] Vic Slaughter,[17] Bloodthirst (a demonic presence in Morbius' mind and body who later manifests his own body in issue #20),[18] and Bloodbath.[19] Along with these foes, Morbius the Living Vampire featured recurring appearances by Simon Stroud. Introduced as a rogue CIA agent hunting the Man-Wolf in Creatures on the Loose #37, Stroud had first encountered Morbius in Adventure into Fear #27 and was now determined to end the Living Vampire's life./nTo increase awareness and the popularity of Morbius the Living Vampire, a reprint series entitled Morbius Revisited was published from 1992 to 1993. The series featured material originally published in Adventure into Fear #27\u201331. Along with this, Morbius appeared in short solo stories featured in the anthology series Midnight Sons Unlimited (1993\u20131995), as well as in Marvel Comics Presents #144, the one-shot Strange Tales: Dark Corners #1 (May 1998), Amazing Fantasy (vol. 2) #17 (March 2006), and the one-shot Legion of Monsters: Morbius #1 (September 2007)./nAs he was now a vigilante and part of the Midnight Sons, Morbius engaged in several team-ups with heroes and anti-heroes throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. He frequently crossed paths with the sorcerer Dr. Strange as well as the Ghost Rider and the Nightstalkers, a group which included Blade as well as Hannibal King, a \"quasi-vampire\" who was similar to Morbius in that he tried to curb his bloodlust so as not to compromise his morals but, unlike Morbius, was a truly supernatural vampire rather than a scientific mutation. In Morbius the Living Vampire #12, Blade is possessed by a demon and, against his will, kills Morbius. Morbius is immediately resurrected in Spirits of Vengeance #13./nDuring the 1993 Marvel Comics crossover event Maximum Carnage, Morbius and his longtime adversary Spider-Man temporarily become uneasy allies to stop a New York City murder spree led by the spree killer Carnage.[20] In Peter Parker: Spider-Man #77\u201380 (1997), Morbius again teams up with Spider-Man to stop HYDRA agent Loxias Crown, who then becomes another pseudo-vampire called the Hunger.[21]/nMorbius the Living Vampire series writer Len Kaminski had regular conflicts with series penciller Ron Wagner. The two were collaborators who used the \"Marvel method\" of comic book scripting, meaning Kaminski would plot out the stories, Wagner would then determine more of the narrative details by illustrating the scenes (potentially adding ones) and creating the narrative pace, after which Kaminski would see the art and any notes Wagner had, then either ask for changes or accept the art and fill in the final dialogue and captions. As time went on, Kaminski claimed Wagner often complained about his stories to the editorial staff and left \"snide margin notes [in the art] in which he made his personal opinion of my plots clear.\" Wagner alleged he expressed concerns Kaminski's stories were too introspective and character-focused when a series about a violent vampire who hunted evil people needed to have more action and bloodshed. According to Kaminski, he was willing to discuss the story and series direction further but Wagner ignored his attempts at contact.[22] Marvel Comics sided with Wagner, replacing Kaminski with issue #9 by asking series colorist Gregory Wright to step in as writer.[22] A one-shot special, tentatively titled Spider-Man/Venom/Morbius was scheduled for 1993, but never published due to Kaminski's departure from the series. Wagner remained as series penciler until issue #15, then left as well./nUnder writer Gregory Wright, the series Morbius the Living Vampire featured the resurrection of Michael's former lover Martine Bancroft in issues #13\u201317. The story line ended with Martine now alive again due to mystical forces, but no longer able to experience her full range of emotions. Throughout the rest of the series, Martine shifts from supporting character to occasional antagonist as she sometimes clashes with Morbius due to resentment over the circumstances of her resurrection and the pursuit of restoring her emotions sometimes placing other in danger./nWright stayed as writer on Morbius the Living Vampire until issue #23. Pat Mills wrote issue #24 in 1994, after which Lisa Trusiani took over as series writer. She remained in this role until issue #32, when the series was cancelled due to declining sales and waning fan interest. The series ends with Morbius being mutated once again by an anti-viral serum that saves his life, but results in his now once again losing his ability to reason and experiencing blackouts when his bloodlust is too strong. This leads him to abandon his vigilante life and the double identity of Dr. Morgan Michaels.[5] The final story arc of the series does not resolve whether or not Morbius' blood disease is still killing him, despite his vampiric regenerative abilities, or if the newest anti-viral system finally put the disease back into remission. It also does not resolve the fact that Martine is left a true undead vampire who is obsessed with Morbius (though this is finally resolved in 2010; see below). Since the series' cancellation, there has been no further depiction of Morbius' 1990s supporting cast of his friend Jacob Weisenthal or his love interests Mandy Tyler and Lena Ivana./nFor the next several years, Morbius once again made sporadic appearances as an uneasy ally or outright villain who encountered other superheroes, particularly Spider-Man./nIn 2010, Morbius and Martine both appear in The Amazing Spider-Man #622, written by Fred Van Lente and illustrated by Joe Quinones. The story features Martine, having now become a true, undead vampire, fighting Morbius and Spider-Man. Morbius ends Martine's life by driving a stake through her heart and then scattering her ashes./nIn 2011, the Marvel Comics series Legion of Monsters (vol. 2) featured Morbius, Jack Russell, and other supernatural-themed characters as a loose-knit team hunting more dangerous monsters. Morbius then appeared in the 2011 crossover event \"Spider-Island\", after which he was seen being incarcerated at the Raft, a prison made for supervillains./nOn October 17, 2012, Marvel announced that Morbius would appear in a new comic book series by writer Joe Keatinge and artist Richard Elson. Morbius the Living Vampire (vol. 2) began publication in January 2013. Unlike the 1990s series that featured Morbius as a violent anti-hero, this series referred to him as a \"hunted, haunted fugitive\", who was now dealing with weakened abilities and mental depression following his escape from the Raft. The series featured the vampire protagonist once again attempting to cure himself of his condition while dealing with New York gangs, including the crime lord known as the Rose. It also expanded Morbius' pre-Living Vampire history, revealing more information about his mother and his childhood friendship with Emil Nikos. Morbius the Living Vampire (vol. 2) met with mixed reviews and low sales, and was cancelled after nine issues.[23]/nDuring the 2019 crossover event Absolute Carnage, Morbius was seen as one of several characters opposing the mass murderer Carnage and the Cult of Knull. In late 2019, Morbius starred in a new series, now simply titled Morbius, written by Vita Ayala with art by Marcelo Ferreira, Francisco Mobili, and Roberto Poggi. The series featured several appearances by Spider-Man, as well as new character Elizabeth Nikos, sister of Morbius' friend, scientific collaborator, and then victim Emil Nikos. Although plans and promotions were released for at least eight issues, the series was abruptly put on hiatus after issue #5 when the COVID-19 pandemic forced Marvel Comics to halt or slow down several operations. Rather than continue the series, it was later officially cancelled.[24]/nIn 2021, Marvel published a one-shot entitled Morbius: Bond of Blood, written by Ralph Macchio, with art by Tom Reilly and Chris O'Halloran. The one-shot featured the first appearance and death of Christos Nikos, son of Emil Nikos.[25]/nMichael Alexander Morbius is born and raised in Greece by his single mother, and experiences a largely isolated childhood due to a rare and fatal blood condition. His only true friend during this time is a boy named Emil Nikos who, like him, is interested in medicine and science. Intellectually gifted, Morbius spends much of his isolation reading and studying. In time, he becomes a highly respected and Nobel Prize-winning biochemist and biologist with a medical degree in hematology. As an adult, Morbius researches a means to cure his own fatal condition, hiring Emil Nikos as his research partner and a woman named Martine Bancroft as his office assistant. Martine and Michael fall in love and become engaged to be married.[2]/nAfter years of research, Michael Morbius attempts a radical cure on himself involving chemical treatments, samples of vampire bat DNA, and electroshock therapy. The experiment puts the blood disease into remission, but radically mutates Morbius into a \"living vampire\" with enhanced abilities. To keep his disease in remission, Morbius must now feed on fresh blood regularly or risk death. His appearance and personality also shift, making him now prone to bouts of rage, paranoia, and bloodlust. During one of these early bouts of bloodlust and madness, Morbius' first victim is his friend Emil.[2] Horrified by his actions and mutation, Morbius leaves for New York to conduct more research in secret. He encounters the scientist-turned-monster known as the Lizard and the adventurer Spider-Man, who at the time is dealing with a mutation that has left him with four extra arms. Samples of Morbius' blood leads the Lizard to revert to his human form of Curt Connors and allows Spider-Man to lose his extra limbs.[2] It is discovered that a few of Morbius' victims did not die and are now infected with a form of his own mutation, giving them increased strength and bloodlust but no further superhuman abilities. Morbius and Martine synthesize an antidote for these victims, but the serum does not work on Morbius' own condition. Overtaken by bloodlust, Morbius attacks Martine, turning her into a pseudo-vampire as well. After using their serum to cure her, Morbius flees rather than endanger Martine again.[2]/nMorbius eventually leaves New York, moving location frequently to avoid capture. During this time, he rescues Amanda Saint from a Satanic cult known as Demon-Fire,[26] then encounters John Jameson, who at the time is cursed to transform into the Man-Wolf. Alongside the Man-Wolf, Morbius battles Spider-Man again.[27] Later, Morbius encounters Reverend Daemond, the Caretakers of the planet Arcturus IV, the Cat People of the Land Within and Tara the Girlchild,[28] the extra-dimensional demon known as Helleyes,[29] and the Living Eraser.[30] He also meets other monsters, such as the Werewolf (Jack Russell),[31][32] the Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze),[32] and the Man-Thing (Ted Sallis),[32] and superhuman adventurers such as Blade,[33] the original X-Men[34] and the Human Torch[35] and the Thing,[30] both members of the Fantastic Four. During this time, he continues to frequently clash with Spider-Man./nLater, Morbius meets rogue CIA agent Simon Stroud and together they fight a group of new pseudo-vampires created by Morbius's bites and resulting infection. One of these pseudo-vampires bites and infects Martine, turning her into a living vampire as well. Thanks to Morbius' efforts, Martine is cured and the other pseudo-vampires destroyed. Morbius then flees, believing he is still a danger to Martine.[36] After this, he befriends desperate landowner Alicia Twain (later avenging her murder)[37] and battles Morgana St. Clair, an enigmatic vampire expert living in England who is a member of a Satanic cult known as the Brotherhood of Judas.[38] Morbius later enlists help in finding a cure for his pseudo-vampirism from his old friend Ronson Slade, a scientist. Slade, however, becomes a werewolf and Morbius is forced to kill him.[39]/nDuring another battle with Spider-Man, Morbius succeeds in feeding on a sample of the hero's radioactive blood. By chance, Morbius is then hit by a lightning bolt at the same time. Morbius survives the lightning strike and discovers he is seemingly human again, his appearance, sanity, and normal human traits restored, though his blood disease has returned and he now requires frequent treatment and blood transfusions.[40] While continuing to research how to stabilize a full cure, Dr. Michael Morbius agrees to stand trial for his several crimes over the years and hires attorney Jennifer Walters (whose identity as the She-Hulk is not publicly known at the time). Later, Morbius learns of Walters' status as the She-Hulk and that she suffers from sometimes erratic transformations. He gives her a serum based on research regarding his own condition and Walters finds herself now able to change form at will (though with effort). In court, Walters' argues that Morbius' crimes as a living vampire were due in large part to his \"medical condition\" affecting his ability to reason, while adding that most of Morbius' victims survived and were cured of pseudo-vampirism by the biochemist himself. Taking this into account, the court finds Morbius guilty of involuntary manslaughter rather than murder.[13]/nFor the next few years of his life, Morbius continues to research his disease while acting as a consultant to others. He becomes a closer friend to the Werewolf (Jack Russell) and offers information to the Avengers that helps them on a case. Eventually, despite all of his efforts, Morbius reverts to being a living vampire again.[41] Working alongside several allies, the sorcerer Doctor Strange is able to use the \"Montesi Formula\" (a spell found in the Darkhold) to banish all undead vampires from Earth's dimension. Morbius is unaffected since he is a scientific mutation and not a supernatural creature. The only other vampire to be unaffected is Hannibal King, a vampire detective who refused to ever feed on living people and so was spared from the spell's effects. Years later, alongside the sorcerers Doctor Strange and Brother Voodoo, Morbius battles Marie Laveau and witnesses the return of true vampires to Earth.[42]/nFrustrated by his repeated failures to cure himself, Morbius takes refuge in the sewers of New York City and discovers a community of underground dwellers who offer to help him in exchange for protection. The community brings Morbius \"bad ones\" to feed on and Morbius believes from their descriptions that these people brought to him are killers themselves. After feeding on several victims, Morbius is confronted by Spider-Man, who accuses him of becoming a serial killer. Discovering the underground community deems anyone living on the surface to be a \"bad one\", Morbius is horrified to realize he has murdered people at random. Disgusted with himself, Morbius flees into the sewers and falls deeper into depression.[43]/nSoon after Spider-Man and Morbius' confrontation in the sewers, Johnny Blaze and the new Ghost Rider (whose human host is Danny Ketch) learn that Lilith the Mother of All Demons has returned to Earth and intends to lay waste to humanity with help from her children and descendants, the Lilin. The Ghost Rider experiences a vision of several individuals who together can oppose Lilith, an alliance known as \"the Nine\" or \"the Midnight Sons.\" Seeing that Morbius is one of the Midnight Sons, the Ghost Rider and Blaze track him down with the aid of Martine Bancroft and her ally Dr. David Langford, a biochemist she hopes can cure Michael at last. Secretly, Langford is working with a villainous scientist named Dr. Thaddeus Paine who intends to kill Morbius and then conduct research on his mutated body; Langford's \"cure\" will actually simply kill. Not knowing this, and wishing to sabotage the effort to help Morbius, Lilith sends one of her Lilin to use their own demonic blood to poison Langford's serum.[3]/nAfter a brief battle with the Ghost Rider and Blaze, Morbius is subdued and taken to Langford's lab, where he is given the false cure. The result of Langford's serum mixed with demon blood creates a new mutagenic agent, altering the Living Vampire's abilities and appearance while also largely restoring his sanity and true personality. Confused by his new state, Morbius seeks out his old friend and colleague, Dr. Jacob Weisenthal, a general practitioner. Meanwhile, Martine discovers Langford's treachery and he kills her. Morbius arrives moments later, feeding on Langford and then realizing he feels no guilt over ending the life of a corrupt and remorseless killer. When the Ghost Rider and Blaze arrive on the scene, Morbius explains the situation and vows he is not an enemy of the innocent. From now on, if he must feed on living people, it will be \"the blood of the guilty,\" villains \"who deserve to die.\"[3] The Ghost Rider accepts this, warning Morbius that this vow may not be easy to follow. Days later, Morbius and the other Midnight Sons hold their first official alliance meeting and join forces against Lilith.[44] Despite his agreement to fight Lilith, Morbius is immediately looked on with suspicion by the Midnight Sons known as the Nightstalkers, a trio of vampire hunters and occult investigators that includes Hannibal King (whose vampirism has returned), the half-vampire Blade, and Frank Drake, the last living mortal descendant of Dracula.[44]/nOver the next year, Morbius confronts several new foes, including Dr. Paine,[15] the Basilisk II (Wayne Gifford),[16] Vic Slaughter,[17] and Bloodbath.[19] During the initial battle with Vic Slaughter and his team the Hardcases, Martine Bancroft's tombstone is damaged by gunfire. Enraged, Morbius kills the Hardcases and drains Slaughter of some blood, but then buries the villain alive rather than killing him outright. Morbius leaves, believing his bite no longer infects people with partial pseudo-vampirism. Morbius later discovers that if he drains a certain amount from a victim, the infection of his bite is actually more powerful than before. Vic Slaughter rises from near-death as a new living vampire, his abilities equal to Morbius.[45]/nDespite not being trusted by many of them, Morbius continues to join the Midnight Sons in battles against evil whenever they need his help. He also aids Spider-Man, Venom, the Black Cat and other superheroes against a gang of supervillains led by spree killers Carnage and Shriek during the crossover event called Maximum Carnage.[46] During a battle with the dream-empowered villain Nightmare, Morbius learns that his new mutation due to demon blood has made him immortal in the traditional sense, meaning he can die from injury but no longer ages.[47] Soon afterward, Blade is influenced by outside forces and becomes a corrupted version of himself called Switchblade. He kills several allies, including Morbius.[48] Soon afterward, Blade is cured of his possession and his victims magically restored, including Morbius.[49]/nFrom Dr. Paine, Morbius learns that his blood disease is not in full remission and will eventually still kill him despite constantly feeding on fresh blood and his otherwise impressive regenerative abilities.[15] With help from Jacob Weisenthal, Morbius researches how to at least alleviate his condition if a cure is impossible. With newly obtained samples of Spider-Man's radioactive blood, Morbius and Weisenthal create an \"anti-viral\" serum that restores his human form for several hours at a time. Now able to operate for part of the day as a normal man, Morbius creates the cover identity of Dr. Morgan Michaels and attains a job as a hematologist at St. Jude's Memorial Hospital in New York.[17] As a hematologist, Morbius is able to steal collected blood donations to briefly alleviate his bloodlust in between feeding on living people, although the preservatives and anti-coagulants used with donated blood means it will poison Morbius if he ingests too much of it. He also attains a hyperbolic chamber and dialysis equipment, allowing him to oxygenate his blood and cleanse his system as he sleeps.[17]/nJack Russell tracks Morbius to St. Jude's Hospital, offering to help the man learn how to live with his newest mutation rather than attempt to fight it. Morbius refuses this viewpoint, arguing that being a living vampire is a curse he should not accept.[48] Later, fearing his condition is worsening, Morbius attempts to cure himself with \"necro-technology\" used by the Nightstalkers, but this fails. Morbius also attempts feeding on the blood of the vampire Hannibal King to see if it affects him, only to discover his body simply rejects vampire blood since it is \"lifeless.\"[50]/nAt the hospital, Morbius meets and is romantically pursued by Mandy Tyler, the executive administrative assistant of the hospital's hematology department. Mandy later learns of Morbius' true nature and tells him she accepts it. On a date, Mandy reveals she is part of a private fetish club whose members emulate vampires by drinking blood. Morbius meets the club's leader, Brian DeWolff. Formerly the vigilante called the Wraith, DeWolff is secretly using his psionic powers to turn the club members into followers who will perform terrorist acts against the NYPD. With the help of the cyborg Deathlok, Morbius halts the \"vampire cult\" from committing a terrorist bombing and then seemingly kills DeWolff.[51]/nThanks to traces of Lilin blood still in Morbius' body, the spirit of a Lilin called Bloodthirst begins guiding the Living Vampire's mind. Bloodthirst influences Morbius to use the Darkhold, a book of corrupt magic, to resurrect Martine Bancroft. Morbius then realizes this was a scheme by the Lilin, who use Martine's body so that one of their own, a being called Parasite, may now have a body.[52] Bloodthirst then takes full possession of Morbius' body and attacks the Midnight Sons with the help of Martine/Parasite. With help from Dr. Strange, Morbius reasserts control over his own body. To defeat Parasite, Morbius then kills Martine's body, forcing the Lilin spirit out of her so it can be destroyed. Later, Martine's true spirit is revived and restored to her body, but the resurrection process leaves her a true undead vampire, unable to feel touch. She also claims to lack her full ability to experience emotions, including the love she used to have for Michael.[52] Martine moves into Morbius' home, but becomes frustrated by her new condition.[18] Soon afterward, Morbius expels the traces of Lilin blood in his body so that Bloodthirst cannot influence him further. Bloodthirst is able to manifest a new vampiric body for himself and seriously injures both Jacob and Mandy before Morbius finally destroys him. Morbius decides to distance himself from Mandy to protect her.[18]/nMorbius later encounters Lena Ivana, a woman kidnapped from her home in Eastern Europe and then forced into sex work in New York City. After freeing her, Morbius becomes enamored with Lena. In contrast, she fears Morbius after seeing how quickly he kills criminals. Despite this, Morbius hopes to see her again and suggests to Lena she seeks medical treatment from \"Dr. Morgan Michaels.\" Unaware this is the living vampire who frightens her, Lena finds herself drawn to Dr. Michaels. Lena then takes a job at St. Jude's Memorial Hospital as well, working in the morgue and seeing Dr. Michaels often.[53]/nMartine becomes obsessed with having her humanity restored, accusing her former lover of stealing her emotions and dismissing her from his life. Morbius points out that Martine's changed attitude and lack of love for him cannot be due to a lack of emotions because she clearly feels anger, resentment, hope, frustration, and envy. Though he promises to continue searching for a way to cure her of being undead, he says that he and Martine cannot resume a relationship due to their feelings for each other changing. After fighting Morbius and then hurling herself through a window, Martine leaves but rents a nearby apartment so she can continue spying on her former lover. She then begins a casual romantic relationship with Jack Russell.[53]/nLena Ivana's influence leads Morbius to reconsider his vow to only feed on the guilty, realizing he does not investigate his criminal victims enough to fully realize if they are in need of help or can be reformed. He decides it is better to abstain from feeding and simply allow himself to die rather than continue to justify murder. Realizing his friend intends to commit suicide, Jack Russell confronts Morbius and they fight each other. Weakened by the fight and a lack of blood for several days, Morbius is then exposed to the rising sun and quickly burns. Jacob Weisenthal arrives and administers his latest attempt at a cure for Morbius' mutation, but the pseudo-vampire seemingly dies. Jacob and Jack Russell arrange for a midnight burial attended by the Midnight Sons, Martine, and Lena. Possibly thanks to Jacob's latest anti-viral serum, Morbius suddenly heals and regains consciousness, rising from his grave.[54]/nAs a result of Jacob's serum, Morbius seems to lose his bloodlust and only temporarily achieves a partial vampiric appearance every night at midnight. Jacob becomes alarmed that Morbius is experiencing blackouts again and may be feeding without realizing it, but Michael insists he is cured and continues pursuing Lena romantically. Enraged with jealousy, Martine meets with Lena and tells her Dr. Morgan Michaels is actually the Living Vampire, Michael Morbius. Feeling betrayed, Lena leaves Michael. Morbius then realizes he is experiencing bloodlust again and losing his reason as he regains his full vampiric appearance. After blacking out, Morbius realizes he has attacked and fed on a random person. Jacob's latest \"cure\" has only made him once again a monster who loses all reason and sanity when he feels the need to feed, no longer able to maintain any kind of morality or any vow to only feed on the \"blood of the guilty.\" Driven by his bloodlust and once again a danger to anyone around him, Morbius abandons his Morgan Michaels identity and leaves behind both Jacob and St. Jude's Memorial Hospital.[5] Although Jacob's serum did not cure his pseudo-vampirism, it evidently put his blood disease back into remission, as it is never mentioned again that the disease is still killing him.[15]/nOnce again a fugitive, Morbius escapes detection for some time while occasionally clashing with Spider-Man. An encounter with the mutant Nate Grey leads Morbius' hunger to temporarily increase.[55] Frightened that his condition is worsening, Morbius seeks out help from hematologist Dr. Andrea Janson. Before he can be helped, he is captured and tortured by HYDRA agent Loxias Crown. He then assists both Spider-Man and S.H.O.C. against the terrorist organization and drains Crown of blood before leaving him for dead.[21] Rather than die, Crown becomes a new pseudo-vampire called the Hunger and creates a cult of pseudo-vampire followers.[56] Later, Morbius is kidnapped and biologically engineered to be more powerful so he can oppose the Hunger. He is freed by Spider-Man and Blade, but the identity of who kidnapped and experimented on him is never revealed.[57]/nYears later, the Superhuman Registration Act is passed, obligating anyone with superhuman abilities to register with S.H.I.E.L.D. and comply with its authority. For a time, Morbius submits to the SRA and joins an effort to capture Blade.[58] Later, during an invasion from the Marvel Zombies universe of Earth-2149, Morbius is seen as a member of A.R.M.O.R. and fights a zombie version of himself.[59] Shortly afterward, Morbius forms a new version of the Midnight Sons with Jennifer Kale, Daimon Hellstrom, Jack Russell and the Man-Thing. Together, they contain a zombie outbreak on an isolated island, briefly encountering the Hood in the process.[60] Morbius also helps the Man-Thing revive the Punisher (Frank Castle) into the monster called Franken-Castle.[61]/nWhen Morbius concludes that Spider-Man's blood cells may help cure Jack Russell of being the Werewolf, he steals samples of the Web-Slinger's blood. Spider-Man learns Morbius is behind the theft from Martine Bancroft, who has allowed herself to become a true undead vampire. The hero finds Morbius and Martine arrives, declaring once more her desire to reunite with her former lover and offering to kill his frequent enemy Spider-Man as proof of her love. Morbius refuses to endanger Spider-Man and argues that Martine's feeling for him is only a longing for completion because her soul has not been intact since her resurrection. Seeing that Spider-Man cannot bring himself to kill even a vampire, Morbius takes action himself and kills Martine with wood driven through the heart, causing her body to disintegrate to ashes that are then scattered. Despite their history as enemies, the Web-Slinger voluntarily donates more blood samples to Morbius to aid in his research.[62]/nAfter briefly working with Doctor Octopus,[63] Morbius accepts an offer to become a researcher at Horizon Labs, given access to advanced equipment in exchange for sharing his research with company head Max Modell. To keep his identity hidden from the other researchers who may not approve of this, Morbius stays hidden and is referred to only as Number Six, since he occupies Lab 6. Peter Parker later learns the truth of Number Six's identity during the \"Spider-Island\" affair. Morbius is later confronted by the authorities and taken to the supervillain prison known as the Raft, but escapes during a large-scale breakout. Taking refuge in the neighborhood of Brownsville, he becomes a local protector, leading to confrontations with the newest criminal to call himself the Rose (Phillip Hayes). During this time, he develops a friendship with Bucky Barnes and encounters his long-estranged father, Makarioa Morbius.[64]/nDuring a journey to Barcelona, Morbius is captured by local vampires. He then joins forces with Domino, Diamondback and Outlaw to defeat them before Domino helps him escape a vampire hunter.[65] Morbius later becomes involved in a Vampire Civil War and is rescued from Dracula's disciples by the Wasp and the Man-Wolf.[66] When the spree killer Carnage and the Cult of Knull threaten humanity, Morbius joins the efforts to oppose them. Later, Morbius finds himself hunted by Elizabeth Nikos, the sister of his longtime friend, scientific collaborator and first victim Emil Nikos. Not long after that, Morbius also meets Emil's son, Christos Nikos, who hopes the Living Vampire's genetics may cure him of his own fatal illness. These efforts fail and Christos dies.[67]/nDuring the \"Beyond\" story line, Morbius briefly fights the new Spider-Man (Ben Reilly, a clone of Peter Parker) before fleeing. After taking a sample of Reilly's blood, which is identical to Parker's on a cellular level, Morbius realizes Spider-Man's radioactive blood will no longer work in creating even a temporary cure for his pseudo-vampirism.[68] Upon being taken to the Beyond Corporation's secret facility on Staten Island, Morbius' genetic template is used to help create Creature Z, a \"binary clone\" of Morbius himself and a genetic duplicate of the Lizard. Morbius helps Misty Knight and Colleen Wing fight Creature Z and is able to destroy it with his own blood.[69]/nEven before he contracted the disease of pseudo-vampirism, Michael Morbius already possessed a genius-level intellect. He is an M.D.[3] with a Ph.D in biochemistry. A biologist specializing in hematology,[70] Michael Morbius is an expert radiologist and a Nobel laureate.[3] His own condition as a \"living vampire\" and his frequent studies of superhumans such as Spider-Man, the She-Hulk, Martine Bancroft (when she was resurrected as an undead vampire), and the Werewolf (Jack Russell) have made him an authority on superhuman mutation, including those influenced by supernatural or magical forces./nExperimental procedures have turned Michael Morbius into a pseudo-vampire or living vampire. As opposed to a true undead vampire who is reanimated by supernatural forces, Morbius is still a living being with no inherent supernatural or magical energies (though he has at times been temporarily affected or tainted by demonic forces). As such, his abilities, traits and weaknesses are similar to, but do not exactly align with, those of true undead vampires that inhabit the Marvel Universe./nMorbius' senses are somewhat enhanced, granting him greater hearing, taste and smell, as well as night vision.[71] His talons are able to easily tear through flesh, bone, and wood (though not metal or concrete). Morbius' mutation has altered and increased the strength of his skeleton, as well as his muscle tissue. He has superhuman strength. allowing him to lift nearly two tons of weight.[72] He has resistance to physical injury a few times greater than that of an average human being, making it more difficult to burn him, pierce his organs or break his bones./nMorbius has advanced regenerative abilities (though his healing factor is not as strong as that of Dracula, the Lord of the Vampires or the mutant Wolverine).[73] Given time, he can recover from many and multiple wounds that would be fatal for a normal human being. Bullet wounds can be fully healed in hours, while more severe damage such as broken bones, major damage to organs and severe burns may take a few days to recover (fresh blood will also enhance his cellular regeneration). If the injuries are severe enough and he is not given time to heal before further injury or is unable to ingest sufficient blood in due time, he will succumb to his wounds and die. Morbius has also concluded that he would be unable to regenerate lost limbs and organs if they were completely destroyed./nMorbius has psionic abilities that allow him to hypnotize others.[74] The strength of this hypnosis varies from person to person, allowing Morbius to either influence them subtly or alter their short-term memory of a recent event. Some people, such as those who are aware of Morbius' hypnotic abilities, seem more resistant to this power. Morbius' psionic power also allows for a limited telekinetic-like ability that allows him to glide on air currents and aids him in climbing surfaces such as walls. While gliding, his top speed is believed to be roughly 35\u00a0mph./nMorbius has often used specialized clothing to aid him. His original costume had bat-like wings attached underneath the sleeves to aid him in gliding. He later wore a reinforced leather outfit to provide extra protection in battle. Later on, he used Horizon Labs resources to develop personal body armor.[75]/nMost of Morbius' victims die from blood loss, even those he does not drain completely. On rare occasion, Morbius' bite has infected a victim with a mutation similar but weaker to his own, giving them some enhanced strength and a desire for blood, but no psionic or healing abilities. This occurred with his former fianc\u00e9 Martine Bancroft, as well as the characters Jefferson Bolt (seen in Marvel Team-Up #3), Emilio (seen in Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man #7), Nate Grey (in X-Man #24), and a homeless woman named Roxy (Legion of Monsters: Morbius #1). When Morbius was temporarily infected by demonic Lilin blood, his bite caused the bounty hunter Vic Slaughter to become another living vampire with near-equal powers and abilities to his. On one occasion, Morbius bit Blade, who is himself a dhampir (or \"half-vampire\"), a being halfway between being a vampire and a normal human being, and the result was that Blade temporarily became a true vampire named Switchblade./nWhile he was infected with demonic Lilin blood, Morbius was able to collapse his body into a near-liquid, putty-like state that allowed him to pass through cracks in doors and other barriers. He lost this ability after expelling the Lilin blood from his body./nAs he is not a true undead vampire, Morbius is unaffected by religious symbols or objects considered holy and he is not affected by wood or silver more than other metals or substances that may damage his body.[76] While he is vulnerable to direct sunlight, he will not be reduced to ashes by it as happens with true undead vampires. Instead, Morbius' skin will take several minutes to blister and burn and it will take several minutes more before he risks being overwhelmed by pain and dehydration. If he is weakened, the burns may become more severe more rapidly, killing him after only a few minutes. Even if he is not in direct sunlight, ambient radiation from the sun weakens his abilities and health unless he is properly protected by lead or concrete barriers./nTo keep his blood disease from returning at an accelerated rate that will quickly kill him, Morbius must regularly drain and feed on blood from living people. He does not require blood on a daily basis, but his need does increase the longer he goes without blood or if he is injured or engages in strenuous activity. Throughout his life since his mutation, Morbius has often been vulnerable to losing all reason and moral inhibition when he is overwhelmed by his bloodlust, causing him to feed and not realize his own actions until minutes later./nTrue undead vampires in the Marvel Universe are sometimes able to survive by draining blood from animals, recently deceased people or even other vampires (the vampire Hannibal King survived for a time by feeding on the recently buried dead). Morbius, however, is unable to be nourished from these same sources and must rely on blood from living human beings. As a stop-gap, Morbius has used collected blood from blood banks when he is desperate to keep his bloodlust at bay; however, the chemical preservatives and anti-coagulants used by blood banks make donated blood a poor source of nourishment for Morbius and it will poison him if he ingests such samples regularly or in great enough quantities./nOn more than one occasion, Spider-Man's radioactive blood (used in tandem with electricity or other chemical agents) has put Morbius' vampiric mutation into remission for hours or even years at a time, leaving him a non-powered human being with normal human vulnerabilities.[40] On a few occasions, however, Morbius has been greatly injured while in his human form and, instead of dying, the shock of the injuries has triggered his pseudo-vampiric form and abilities to immediately return.[17]/nIn the House of M series, Michael Morbius appears in a flashback as one of the scientists (along with Jonas Harrow and Farley Stillwell) behind Luke Cage's powers.[88]/nMorbius the Living Vampire appears in Dead of Night featuring Werewolf by Night #4 as one of the anomalous beings contained and experimented on by the Babylon Group. When Jack Russell attempts to escape from the Babylon Group with his infant daughter, the facility tries to stop him by unleashing Morbius and the Frankenstein Monster. In the ensuing brawl, Morbius' heart is punched out by the Monster.[89]/nA zombie version of Morbius the Living Vampire appears in the 2008\u20132009 Marvel Zombies 4 miniseries. The real Morbius is defeated and abducted by his zombie version, who somehow found a way from Earth-2149 in the Marvel Zombies Universe into Earth-616 in the mainstream Marvel Universe. The zombie Morbius holds the real one captive while using a latex mask to look normal.[59] It is revealed that he plans to infect every member of the Fifty State Initiative with the zombie virus. Morbius' captivity is later inadvertently uncovered by an A.R.M.O.R. team member, whom he tries to warn of an impending attack. The warning comes too late, however, as the zombie Morbius attacks the team member and infects her, thus creating a violent chain of events after she attacks another team member.[90] Toward the end of the crisis, the real Morbius appears out of nowhere and grabs a tree, which he uses as a stake and stabs his zombie version from behind and straight into the heart, killing him instantly.[91]/nThe Ultimate Marvel version of Morbius the Living Vampire is more akin to a traditional vampire, the son of Dracul and brother of Vlad III Dracula himself.[92] He has all of the powers and abilities associated with the usual interpretation of Dracula. This version of Morbius, however, seems to be heroically struggling against his baser instincts and is, in fact, a vampire hunter. He meets Spider-Man in a typical misunderstanding, centering on a cabal of vampires attacking Ben Urich. He tries to stop Urich from becoming a vampire, in which he succeeds, despite the conflict. When Spider-Man is bitten by a vampire, Morbius sniffs Spider-Man and determines that the young superhero is immune to vampirism.[93]/nDuring the \"Spider-Geddon\" story line, different versions of Morbius the Living Vampire are seen:/nIn this new universe, Morbius the Living Vampire is fused with Morpheus and is an enemy of the hero known as the Arachknight (a fusion of Spider-Man and the Moon Knight).[96]/nMichael Morbius appears in the newspaper strip The Amazing Spider-Man. He returns to New York, seemingly cured of his pseudo-vampirism, and with a fianc\u00e9, Martine Bancroft. However, at night, he begins exhibiting his old symptoms and comes into conflict with Spider-Man. It is later revealed that Bancroft is behind his troubles and gained her own vampiric abilities after she was attacked and killed by Dracula.", "29039745": "Georges Chapouthier (born 27 March 1945 in Libourne) is a French neuroscientist and philosopher./nGeorges Chapouthier is the son of Odette Mazaubert and Fernand Chapouthier (1899\u20131953).

He was prevented from doing much fieldwork himself, but received and described bird specimens from A.O. Hume, Samuel Tickell, Robert Swinhoe among others. His Natural History of the Cranes was published posthumously in 1881.[2][3]/nOn 23 December 1810, Blyth was born in London.[4] His father, a clothier, died in 1820 and his mother sent him to Dr. Fennell's school in Wimbledon. He took an interest in reading, but was often to be found spending time in the woods nearby. Leaving school in 1825, he went to study chemistry, at the suggestion of Dr. Fennell, in London under Dr. Keating at St. Paul's Churchyard. He did not find the teaching satisfactory and began to work as a pharmacist in Tooting, but quit in 1837 to try his luck as an author and editor. In 1836, he produced an annotated edition of Gilbert White's Natural History of Selborne which was reprinted in 1858.[5][6]/nHe was offered the position of curator at the museum of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1841. He was so poor that he needed an advance of 100 pounds to make the trip to Calcutta. In India, Blyth was poorly paid (the Asiatic Society did not expect to find a European curator for the salary that they could offer), with a salary of 300 pounds per year (which was unchanged for twenty years), and a house allowance of 4 pounds per month. He married in 1854, and tried to supplement his income by writing under a pseudonym (Zoophilus) for the Indian Sporting Review, and traded live animals between India and Britain to wealthy collectors in both countries. In this venture he sought the collaboration of eminent people such as Charles Darwin and John Gould, both of whom declined these offers.[7][8][9]/nAlthough a curator of a museum with many responsibilities, he contributed mainly to ornithology, often ignoring the rest of his work. In 1847, his employers were unhappy at his failure to produce a catalogue of the museum. Some Asiatic Society factions opposed Blyth, and he complained to Richard Owen in 1848:/nThey intrigue in every way to get rid of me; accuse me of being an Ornithologist, and that the society did not want an ornithologist...I could astonish you by various statements of what I have to put up with but forbear./nHe also found the ornithologist  George Robert Gray, keeper at the British Museum, uncooperative in helping him with his ornithological research far away in India. He complained to the trustees of the museum but it was dismissed with several character references in favour of Gray including Charles Darwin.[10]/nBlyth's work on ornithology led him to be recognized as the father of Indian ornithology a title later transferred to Allan Octavian Hume.[11]/nMr. Blyth, who is rightly called the Father of Indian Ornithology, was by far the most important contributor to our knowledge of the Birds of India. As the head of the Asiatic Society's Museum, by intercourse and correspondence, formed a large collection for the Society, and enriched the pages of the Society's Journal with the results of his study. Thus he did more for the study of the birds of India than all previous writers. There can be no work on Indian Ornithology without reference to his voluminous contributions. .../nHe married a widow, Mrs. Hodges (born Sutton) who had moved to India, in 1854. She however died in December 1857, a shock which led to his health deteriorating from then on.[8]/nEdward Blyth wrote three articles on variation, discussing the effects of artificial selection and describing the process in nature as restoring organisms in the wild to their archetype (rather than forming new species). However, he never actually used the term \"natural selection\".[12] These articles were published in The Magazine of Natural History between 1835 and 1837.[13][14][15][16][17][18]/nIn February 1855 Charles Darwin, seeking information on variations in domesticated animals of various countries, wrote to Blyth who was \"much gratified to learn that a subject in which I have always felt the deepest interest has been undertaken by one so competent to treat of it in all its bearings\" and they corresponded on the subject.[19] Blyth was among the first to recognise the significance of Alfred Russel Wallace's paper \"On the Law which has regulated the introduction of Species\" and brought it to the notice of Darwin in a letter written in Calcutta on 8 December 1855:/nThere can be no doubt of Darwin's regard for Edward Blyth: in the first chapter of On the Origin of Species he wrote \"Mr. Blyth, whose opinion, from his large and varied stores of knowledge, I should value more than that of almost any one, ...\"[22]/nIn 1911, H.M. Vickers considered Blyth's writings as an early understanding of natural selection[23] which was noted in a 1959 paper, where Loren Eiseley claimed that \"the leading tenets of Darwin's work \u2013 the struggle for existence, variation, natural selection and sexual selection \u2013 are all fully expressed in Blyth's paper of 1835\".[24][25] He also cited a number of rare words, similarities of phrasing, and the use of similar examples, which he regarded as evidence of Darwin's debt to Blyth. However, the subsequent discovery of Darwin's notebooks has \"permitted the refutation of Eiseley's claims\".[26] Eiseley argued that Blyth's influence on Darwin \"begins to be discernible in the Darwin Note-book of 1836 with the curious word 'inosculate'. It is a word which has never had a wide circulation, and which is not to be found in Darwin's vocabulary before this time.\" This was incorrect: an 1832 letter written by Darwin commented that William Sharp Macleay \"never imagined such an inosculating creature\". The letter preceded Blyth's publication, and indicates that both Darwin and Blyth had independently taken the term from Macleay whose Quinarian system of classification had been popular for a time after its first publication in 1819\u20131820. In a mystical scheme this grouped separately created genera in \"osculating\" (kissing) circles.[27]/nBoth Ernst Mayr and Cyril Darlington interpret Blyth's view of natural selection as maintaining the type:/nIn this negative formulation, natural selection only preserves a constant and unchangeable type or essence of created form, by eliminating extreme variations or unfit individuals that deviate too far from this essence. The formulation goes back to the ancient Greek philosopher Empedocles, and the theologian William Paley set out a variation on this argument in 1802, to refute (in later pages) a claim that there had been a wide range of initial creations, with less viable forms eliminated by nature to leave the modern range of species:[29][30]/nThe way Blyth himself argued about the modification of species can be illustrated by an extract concerning the adaptations of carnivorous mammals:/nStephen Jay Gould writes that Eiseley erred in failing to realize that natural selection was a common idea among biologists of the time, as part of the argument for created permanency of species. It was seen as eliminating the unfit, while some other cause created well-fitted species. Darwin introduced the idea that natural selection was creative in giving direction to a process of evolutionary change in which small hereditary changes accumulate.[29] John Wilkins indicates that Blyth considered that species had \"invariable distinctions\" establishing their integrity, and so was opposed to transmutation of species as if it occurred, \"we should seek in vain for those constant and invariable distinctions which are found to obtain\". Darwin held the opposite view, and did not read Blyth until after formulating his own theory. In contrast to Eiseley's claim that Blyth felt that Darwin had plagiarised the idea, Blyth remained a valued correspondent and friend of Darwin's after the idea was published.[30]/nBlyth returned to London on 9 March 1863 to recover from ill health. He was to get a full year's pay for this sick leave. He however had to borrow money from John Henry Gurney and continued his animal trade. \nAround 1865, he began to help Thomas C. Jerdon in the writing of the Birds of India but had a mental breakdown and had to be kept in a private asylum. He was a corresponding member of the Zoological Society and was elected an extraordinary member of the British Ornithological Union, nominated by Alfred Newton. He later took to drinking and was once held for assaulting a cab driver. He died of heart disease on 27 December 1873 and is buried in a family grave in Highgate Cemetery.[7][9]/nAlthough Blyth spent most of his time in the museum in India, he was aware and interested in the study of birds in life. Prior to moving to India, he conducted some experiments to examine if cuckoo eggs (or more generally foreign eggs) were detected and removed by the hosts by placing eggs of one species in the nests of others. In 1835 he wrote that he had experimentally found chaffinches to remove a foreign egg when placed in their clutch. He also suggested the idea of replacing the original clutch with another clutch but with a single foreign egg and suggested based on his own results that either the foreign eggs would be discarded or that the birds would abandon the nest.[33][34] Blyth also examined the patterns of moult in various bird groups.[35]/nBlyth edited the section on \"Mammalia, Birds, and Reptiles\" in the English edition of Cuvier's Animal Kingdom published in 1840, inserting many observations, corrections, and references of his own. His Catalogue of the mammals and birds of Burma was published posthumously in 1875.[7][4]/nWorking in the scientific field of herpetology, from 1853 through 1863, he described over three dozen new species of reptiles[36] and several new species of amphibians.[37]/nAvian species bearing his name include Blyth's hornbill, Blyth's leaf warbler, Blyth's hawk-eagle, Blyth's olive bulbul, Blyth's parakeet, Blyth's frogmouth, Blyth's reed warbler, Blyth's rosefinch, Blyth's shrike-babbler, Blyth's tragopan, Blyth's pipit, and Blyth's kingfisher.

In 1966 he was appointed deputy director, and in 1967 director of the Application Center of the institute. In the years 1938-1944,  with Paul Giroud he studied the adaptation of Rickettsia prowazekii, the agent responsible for typhus, by the inoculation of a rabbit by the respiratory route.

He was four years old when his father, Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e Raoul Panthier, died following gas poisoning during World War I. As ward of the state, Ren\u00e9 Panthier studied medicine at the Faculty of Medicine in Paris. He became Paris Hospital intern in 1934 and trained at the Pasteur Hospital under the supervision of a renowned infectious clinician, Ren\u00e9 Martin.[10][11] He completed a thesis on hemorrhagic fevers under the supervision of Paul Giroud. He defended his Medical Degree in September 1939,[12] a few days after Britain and France declared war on Germany following Poland invasion./nIn September 1939, Panthier was called and assigned to a military field hospital. He was released from service in August 1940 in Castres after the Germans invaded France. He resumed his research on typhus under the direction of Paul Giroud in the vaccine department of the Pasteur Institute in Paris. He participated in one of the first French movement of resistance fighters, the Arm\u00e9e des Volontaires (A.V.). Following the arrest, on 11 February 1942, of Marie-Auguste Chabaud, research assistant in the leprosy laboratory of the Pasteur Institute and head of the AV group in the 15th district of Paris, he was sent quickly on a mission by Jacques Trefou\u00ebl, director of the Pasteur Institute, first at the Pasteur Institute in Algiers (Algeria) and then at La Roche Beaulieu[13] in the remaining free part of France (Zone libre), to create production centers for typhus vaccine.[14] At that time, the Pasteur Institute faced a sensitive issue\u00a0: the German authorities requisitioned serums and vaccines while typhus raged in French prison camps in Germany. Decision was made to produce typhus vaccine on a large scale using the Durand - Giroud process. The vaccine produced in the unoccupied territories was sent to the prison camps.[15] Upon his return to occupied Paris in May 1943, he participated in the subversive activities of the Wizard (Jean Millet/William Savy) network of the Special Operation Executive, and became an underground agent (P2) from March to September 1944.[16] Wizard network tasks led to the identification of a secret ammunition dump containing 2,000 V1 rockets ready to fire in the stone quarries at St-Leu-d'Esserent, near Paris. Bomber command stove it between 27 June and 5 August 1944.[17] He was entrusted in November 1944 the establishment of a medical service responsible for the reception of prisoners, deportees and refugees in Lille at the northern tip of France. Recalled at his request in the Far East Expeditionary Force, he volunteered to participate in the reduction of one of the last pockets of Third Reich resistance along the Atlantic coast of France, in Royan. He was injured on 15 April 1945 by a mortar shrapnel during military operation. He embarked as a lieutenant doctor on 5 November 1945 aboard the victory ship Kings Point Victory for Indochina where he was appointed chief medical officer of the Indochina-South military laboratory and head of the bacteriology laboratory of the Pasteur Institute in Saigon (currently Ho Chi Minh City). He was demobilized in Marseille on 28 February 1947 and returned to the Pasteur Institute in Paris./nHe then entered the influenza laboratory directed by Ren\u00e9 Dujarric de la Rivi\u00e8re. At the latter's request, he tried to apply the method used by Paul Giroud and Paul Durand to the typhus bacteria for the influenza virus. This strategy revealed unsuccessful\u00a0; it did not replace the preparation of the influenza vaccine on eggs. He met Paule Descola who was preparing her M.D. thesis on polioviruses], in Jean Vieuchange's laboratory at the Pasteur Institute.[18] He married her in March 1948. Four children were born from this union: Marie-Lise, Gilles, Jean-Jacques and Jean-No\u00ebl. During the winter of 1948, he and his collaborators isolated the first strains of influenza virus in France./nHe was appointed in July 1949 director of the Hellenic Pasteur Institute. The Second World War and the ensuing Greek Civil War left the Pasteur Institute in Athens in a sorry state. A the end of this mission he was appointed honorary director of the Hellenic Pasteur Institute. He returned to the Pasteur Institute in Paris in 1952 to work on the yellow fever virus. He set up research laboratories and the production of yellow fever vaccine according to the method of Max Theiler, Nobel Prize in medicine in 1951. He developed in particular a method of titration of yellow fever antibodies by a neutralization test. He also ensured an increasing production of the influenza vaccine./nIn 1962 he joined the Pasteur Institute in Guinea as director. The situation of this Pasteur Institute in Kindia was therefore difficult because of the political tensions between France and Guinea, which had just gained independence. Upon his return to the Pasteur Institute in Paris, he extended his activity to other viruses transmitted by insects (arboviruses). He contributed several epidemiological and virological studies on viral infections in France and in Africa.[19][20][21][22] With his collaborators, he isolated in France strains of arboviruses pathogenic for humans, including West Nile virus (1964).[5][23][24][25][26]/nIn March 1964, the situation at the Pasteur Institute was worrying. A study commission for the reform of the Pasteur Institute, made of Elie Wollman, Ren\u00e9 Panthier and Bernard Virat was established.

His main works were A General Synopsis of Birds (1781\u20131801) and General History of Birds (1821\u20131828). He was able to examine specimens of Australian birds which reached England in the last twenty years of the 18th century, and was responsible for providing English names for many of them. He named some of Australia's most famous birds, including the emu, sulphur-crested cockatoo, wedge-tailed eagle, superb lyrebird, Australian magpie, magpie-lark and pheasant coucal. He was also the first to describe the hyacinth macaw. Latham has been called the \"grandfather\" of Australian ornithology./nJohn Latham was born on 27 June 1740 at Eltham in northwest Kent. He was the eldest son of John Latham (died 1788),[1] a surgeon, and his mother, who was a descendant of the Sothebys, in Yorkshire.[2]/nHe was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and then studied anatomy under William Hunter and completed his medical education in London hospitals. In 1763 at the age of 23 he began working as a physician in the village of Darenth, near Dartford in Kent. In the same year he married Ann Porter. They had four children of whom a son John (1769-1822) and a daughter Ann (1772-1835) survived childhood.[3]/nLatham retired from his medical practice aged 56 in 1796 and moved to live near his son at Romsey  in Hampshire. His wife died in 1798 and Latham remarried the same year to Ann Delamott. His son who had invested in a series of inns became heavily indebted and was declared bankrupt in 1817. Latham lost much of his wealth in supporting his son. In 1819 Latham sold his house in Romsey and moved with his wife to live with his daughter's family in Winchester. His second wife died in 1821 and then in the following year his son committed suicide.[3]/nLatham died aged 96 in Winchester on 4 February 1837 and was buried in Romsey Abbey.[3]/nA General Synopsis of Birds was Latham's first ornithological work and contained 106 illustrations by the author. It described many new species which Latham had discovered in various museums and collections. In this work, like Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, he did not attach importance to the names of the species which he described. Later, Latham realised that only the use of the Linnean binomial system would give him the honour of originating the species' scientific names. Thus he published in 1790, a Index Ornithologicus where he specified a binomial name for all the species which he had previously described. However, it was too late, as Johann Friedrich Gmelin had already published his own version of Linnaeus' Systema Natur\u00e6 in which he gave a scientific name to Latham's species; taking into account the rules of nomenclature, Gmelin has priority. Nevertheless, there are around eighty bird species for which Latham's 1790 publication is cited as the authority. These include the emu, the black swan, the hyacinth macaw, the sulphur-crested cockatoo, and the noisy friarbird.[4]/nA supplement to the Index Ornithologicus containing additional scientific names was published as Supplementum indicis ornithologici sive systematis ornithologiae with the year of 1801 on the title page. Although there is circumstantial evidence that the supplement was not available until 1802, for the purposes of zoological nomenclature the evidence for a later publication date has not been deemed sufficient to justify changing the year.[5]/nWorking from drawings, Latham appears to have had difficulty in distinguishing the different species and some he described more than once under different names. In his Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici he described the Australian noisy miner four times: as the chattering bee-eater (Merops garrulus), the black-headed grakle (Gracula melanocephala), the hooded bee-eater (Merops cucullatus), and the white-fronted bee-eater (Merops albifrons).[6][7] This has caused some confusion in the ornithological literature as to the correct scientific name.[8] Latham's 1801 Latin supplement is the authority for around seventy species of birds, almost all of which occur only in Australasia. They include the Pacific gull, the barking owl, the noisy miner, the Australian magpie and the magpie-lark.[4]/nBeginning in 1821, when Latham was in his eighties, he published an expanded version in eleven volumes of his earlier work with the title A General History of Birds. The ornithologist Alfred Newton later wrote in Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica that: \"his defect as a compiler, which had manifest itself before, rather increased with age, and the consequences were not happy.\"[9]/nLatham maintained a regular correspondence with Thomas Pennant, Joseph Banks, Ashton Lever and others.

Ledyard Stebbins.[4][6] She joined the faculty of Occidental College in Los Angeles in 1968, then was hired by UC Davis in 1973,[4] and at the time of her death in 2000 was an adjunct professor and executive associate director of the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory (VGL) at UC Davis.[1][3]/nShe married Michael Bowling in 1981.[4]  Both members of the couple shared a strong interest in genetics; prior to their marriage, Ann used Michael's stud book research in her own 1980 study of genetic diseases.[7] Michael Bowling wrote a number of articles on Arabian horse genetics for general-interest publications,[a] and the pair collaborated on a study of mtDNA in Arabian bloodlines.[11] Their daughter Lydia attended veterinary school and UC Davis and became a veterinarian.[12][13][14]/nBowling developed some of the first blood typing and DNA parentage tests for horses, and became a genetics consultant to several horse breed registries, including The Jockey Club, Arabian Horse Association (originally Arabian Horse Registry of America), American Quarter Horse Association, and the American Morgan Horse Association.[2] Beginning in 1976, she published research on animal blood types,[15][16][17] and developed tests using blood type to establish parentage.[18] She advocated for adopting blood typing for parentage verification of registered animals. Numerous breed registries did so.[2]  In the course of this research, she also studied the phenomenon of chimerism, which sometimes created inconsistent results in parentage testing.[19]/nBy the late 1990s, as the science of parentage testing evolved, she researched the effectiveness of DNA typing and concluded that it was as effective as blood typing for verifying parentage.[20]  Her lab pioneered the DNA-based parentage verification of horses and camelids \u2014species for which Bowling herself had conducted research[b]\u2014using  microsatellites as biomarkers.[21] This testing program also expanded to include eight other types of mammals.[21]/nBowling applied her work on identifying parentage to help preserve the genetic diversity of the Przewalski's horse. Among other work, she reconstructed the herd book of the captive Askania Nova herd in Ukraine using parentage testing data.[2]  She studied the genetics of Mustangs in the Great Basin and located genetic markers linking them to other domesticated horse breeds.[22]  She also performed research on the blood types of the Paso Fino breed.[23]/nSome of the more unusual work the VGL performed was a 1996 investigation by Scotland Yard, which sought help from the lab to identify the source of a blood sample associated with a murder. The lab identified the sample as being from a dog that was at the crime scene, and this information helped crack the case by leading investigators to a suspect who was the owner of the dog.  Bowling was the director of the laboratory at the time, and as a result of this work, expanded the lab's scope so it could continue to help identify animals present at crime scenes and those animals which themselves were victims of crimes such as theft or animal abuse.  From this beginning, the VGL also later helped create a national canine database used to prosecute cases of dogfighting.[21] Bowling also published articles on parentage in mules, including a case where she proved the rare occurrence of a fertile mule mare by parentage testing.[c]/nFrom very early in her career, Bowling wrote about educating horse breeders on genetic diseases in purebred animals and how to deal with these conditions.[24] She performed a number of studies on the Arabian horse breed, including research into one of the genetic diseases that affects Arabians, cerebellar abiotrophy (CA). In 1985, she created a breeding herd at UCD of horses known to carry CA, and this small group provided preliminary DNA data for researchers.[25] Bowling's own studies of CA were unpublished at the time of her death, but she is credited with demonstrating that the condition had a recessive mode of genetic inheritance and was likely the result of a single mutated allele.[26]  A DNA marker test for the condition was developed by her successors at UCD, which became available to the public in 2008.[27] In 2011, the causative mutation for cerebellar abiotrophy was identified, and the condition was conclusively established as an autosomal recessive.[28]/nBowling also studied genetic conditions in other horse breeds, including hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP) in the American Quarter Horse. In 1996, her research found that the origin of this genetically dominant disorder traced to a single stallion,[29] later identified publicly as Impressive.[30]/nBowling's study of equine coat color genetics originally coincided with her studies of animal parentage.[15][d]  Research related to equine coat colors dovetailed with genetic disease research when she studied overo spotting patterns seen in Paint horses.[31]  She was part of a research team that studied lethal white syndrome (LWS), a fatal condition in newborn foals.[32][33]  She had authored an early study in 1977 that ruled out neonatal isoerythrolysis as a cause of death.[34] In 1983, the team linked LWS to a coat color spotting pattern,[32] later identified as frame overo, which is seen in the American Paint Horse and related breeds.[35]  In 1997 Bowling was one of three researchers to identify the gene responsible for LWS, and in the process identified the condition as the equine version of Hirschsprung disease.[36][37]/nWhile researching lethal white syndrome, Bowling also studied the phenomenon of cropouts; spotted offspring born from two minimally-marked parents.[31]  She also worked with the team that mapped the cream gene,[38] which is a dilution gene with no deleterious effects, though a misconception exists that cream colors might be linked to lethal white syndrome.[39][40]/nIn addition to her work on deleterious mutations associated with horse genetics, Bowling studied genetic disorders in the Australian shepherd dog that appeared to be linked to the merle coat color.[41]/nIn the 1990s, Bowling was one of the leaders in the horse genome project.[42] This work was also important to human medicine, as there are at least 90 genetic conditions that can affect both humans and horses.[43] The horse genome was first sequenced in 2006,[44] and was fully mapped by 2009.[45]/nBowling owned Arabian horses, and was a co-founder of the New Albion Stud along with her husband Michael and her parents, Bill and Claire Trommershausen.[2]  Ann and her parents had owned half-Arabians when they lived in Colorado; Michael Bowling had owned Arabians since 1962.  They started the farm in September 1980, about the same time that Ann and Michael married, and placed an emphasis on bloodlines descended from the Crabbet Arabian Stud. The farm continued to be operated by her husband and daughter after Bowling's death.[14]  Bowling's study of mitochondrial DNA in Arabians found that pedigree records kept by the American registry for Arabian horses were generally reliable from the time of importation forward.  But her work also brought into question a belief commonly held by Arabian breeders that horses imported from the desert identified by specific historic dam lines or \"strains\" in their pedigrees actually traced to specific matrilineal groups.  Bowling also found that some mare lines claimed to originate from the same desert-bred \"strain\" were not related at all, and some mares whose pedigrees claimed they were of different strains turned out to be distantly related.[11]/nBowling was the author or coauthor of two books and 93 scientific journal articles,[4] including:/nBooks/nJournals", "35200165": "Professor Rudolf Konrad Allemann is a Distinguished Research Professor and Pro Vice-Chancellor International and Student Recruitment and Head of the College of Physical Sciences and Engineering at Cardiff University.[1] Allemann joined Cardiff University in 2005, after working at the University of Birmingham, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ETH Zurich and the UK MRC National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill.

Baum eventually transferred to Dalhousie University to work alongside Ransom A. Myers and complete her MSc and PhD.[3] Baum wrote her thesis on the declining shark population[4] and subsequently received the Governor General's Academic Medal.[5] Upon graduating, Baum completed a two year David H. Smith Conservation Research post-doctoral fellowship at Scripps Institution of Oceanography,[6] followed by a Schmidt Ocean Institute postdoctoral fellowship at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis.[7]/nIn 2009, Baum began studying the effects that fishing practices have on coral reefs in Kiritimati.[8] As a professor at the University of Victoria, she was named among 126 recipients of the 2012 Sloan Fellowships from the Alfred P.

He is Tintin's friend, an absent-minded professor and half-deaf physicist, who invents many sophisticated devices used in the series, such as a one-person shark-shaped submarine, the Moon rocket, and an ultrasound weapon. Calculus's deafness is a frequent source of humour, as he repeats back what he thinks he has heard, usually in the most unlikely words possible. He does not admit to being near-deaf and insists he is only a little hard of hearing in one ear, making use of an ear trumpet to hear better./nCalculus first appeared in Red Rackham's Treasure (more specifically in the newspaper prepublication of 4\u20135 March 1943[2]), and was the result of Herg\u00e9's long quest to find the archetypal mad scientist or absent-minded professor. Although Herg\u00e9 had included characters with similar traits in earlier stories, Calculus developed into a much more complex figure as the series progressed./nCalculus is a genius, who demonstrates himself throughout the series to be an expert in many fields of science, holding three PhDs in nuclear and theoretical physics, and planetary astronomy. He is also an experienced engineer, archaeologist, biologist and chemist. Many of his inventions precede or mirror similar technological developments in the real world (most notably the Moon rocket, but also his failed attempt at creating a colour television set). He seeks to benefit humankind through his inventions, developing a pill that cures alcoholism by making alcohol unpalatable to the patient, and refusing under great duress to yield his talents to producing weapons of mass destruction. Calculus is also shown to be in the midst of inventing steerable roller skates during The Red Sea Sharks, although the final product is never shown, with the invention being only merely a sideshow in the overall plot. Much of Calculus's more dangerous work is criticized by Captain Haddock, although Calculus usually interprets this the other way round: his deafness often leads him to misinterpret Haddock's words, preventing him from hearing his real opinion./nCalculus's deafness is a frequent source of humour in his interactions with other people, as he often repeats back what he thinks he has heard, usually in the most unlikely words possible. Additionally, he often diverts the subject of a conversation by responding to a misinterpreted remark. For example, \"But I never knew you had....\" leads Calculus to respond, \"No, young man, I am not mad!\" In the same book he believes that Tintin and Haddock are talking about his sister, before remembering a few moments later that he does not have a sister. He is not perturbed by his handicap, even if it is a source of deep frustration to his friends. He himself does not admit to being near-deaf and insists that he is \"only a little hard of hearing in one ear.\"/nIn the course of the Moon books, however, Calculus leads a team of scientists and engineers working on a major rocket project, motivating him to adopt an ear trumpet, and later a hearing aid, and for the duration of the adventure he has near-perfect hearing. This made him a more serious character, even displaying leadership qualities that had not been shown before or since. However, after completing the journey to the Moon, Calculus discarded his hearing aid, forcing his friends to readjust to his hearing impairment (aside from one panel in The Castafiore Emerald, when Tintin is seen speaking to him through his ear-trumpet); this restored the humour surrounding him, though it could be that he finds his deafness useful since it enables him to focus on his work (something useful for The Calculus Affair, since he was referencing ultrasonic sound)./nCalculus maintains a laboratory at Marlinspike Hall, in which he conducts various experiments. He is fairly protective of his work, on occasion hiding his scientific endeavours from Tintin and Haddock (which gets him into trouble in The Calculus Affair). His lab is also stripped of all its apparatus in the same book. On an earlier occasion, during his efforts to find an antidote to Formula Fourteen in Land of Black Gold, Calculus almost destroyed half of Marlinspike in an explosion./nAlthough generally a mild-mannered (if somewhat oblivious) figure, Calculus flies into an uncharacteristic rage if he feels insulted or ridiculed. He is especially provoked if he ever hears Haddock (or anyone else) call him a \"goat\". On one famous occasion in Destination Moon, he displays uncontrollable ire (\"Goat, am I?\") when an irritated Haddock accuses him of \"acting the goat\" (\"acting like a goat\" in the Golden Press American English translation) by attempting to build a Moon rocket. His subsequent tirade and blatant disregard for security terrifies the usually ebullient Captain; he even lifts the director of security barring his way onto a coat hook. Another occasion is in Flight 714 to Sydney when, due to some misunderstanding, he physically assaults Laszlo Carreidas and has to be held back with great effort by Haddock and Tintin. In the same book, despite his deafness, he hears Captain Haddock tell him that he's \"acting the goat\", but Haddock quickly prevents the severe reaction from occurring. Earlier in Red Rackham's Treasure Calculus is shown with a frown for a few moments when he thinks that the Captain lied to him that Tintin had gone for a row, when Tintin actually was diving to search for treasure. Despite his gentle nature, Calculus is rather sensitive about his work and does not appreciate being ridiculed or belittled for his scientific efforts./nIn spite of all this, his friends stick by him come what may. Haddock invited him to stay at Marlinspike Hall after Calculus discovered it is the captain's ancestral home and bought it in his name thanks to money he had earned through selling the patent for his shark-submarine. He did this because Haddock and Tintin had provided him with the opportunity to test the submersible when they were searching for Red Rackham's Treasure. Tintin and Haddock crossed the world on at least two occasions (Prisoners of the Sun and The Calculus Affair) in order to save him from kidnappers./nHe occasionally comments that he was a great sportsman in his youth, with a very athletic lifestyle. He is a former practitioner of the French martial art savate, although a demonstration in Flight 714 to Sydney shows him to be more than a bit rusty./nCalculus is partly modeled on inventor Auguste Piccard (1884\u20131962), Herg\u00e9 stated in an interview with Numa Sadoul: \"Calculus is a reduced scale Piccard, as the real chap was very tall. He had an interminable neck that sprouted from a collar that was much too large... I made Calculus a mini-Piccard, otherwise I would have had to enlarge the frames of the cartoon strip.\"[3] The Swiss physics professor held a teaching appointment in Brussels when Herg\u00e9 spotted his unmistakable figure in the street. In The Castafiore Emerald, Bianca Castafiore mentions that Calculus is \"famous for his balloon ascensions\", an ironic reference to Piccard./nPhilippe Goddin has suggested that Calculus' deafness was inspired by Paul Eydt, whom Herg\u00e9 had known at Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle where Tintin's adventures had first appeared.[4] Cuthbert Calculus' original French name is \"Tryphon Tournesol\" and Tryphon was the name of Herg\u00e9's plumber.[4]/nIn contrast to his unquestionable scientific merits, Calculus is a fervent believer in dowsing, and carries a pendulum for that purpose. Herg\u00e9 himself was a believer in the subject: dowser Victor Mertens had used a pendulum to find the lost wedding ring of Herg\u00e9's wife in October 1939.[4]/nBefore Calculus appeared in Red Rackham's Treasure, Herg\u00e9 had featured other highly educated but eccentric scholars and scientists, such as the following:/nCalculus's introduction appears to have supplied Herg\u00e9 with the bizarre nature he wished to portray in a man of science. Other figures of high education were shown as more stable and level-headed. The members of the archaeological expedition who fall victim to The Seven Crystal Balls show no apparent signs of eccentricity. The most prominent member of this group is Calculus's friend Hercules Tarragon, with whom he attended university. Tarragon is a large, ebullient man, possessing a jovial nature, but not necessarily eccentric./nWhile he sometimes appears aloof when absorbed in his work, Calculus corresponds with other scientists and also collaborates with many of them on his projects. He works with Mr. Baxter and Frank Wolff on the Moon rocket and corresponds with ultrasonics expert Professor Alfredo Topolino of Nyon in The Calculus Affair./nCalculus is the only main character in the Tintin series to display signs of attraction to women. This is notably evident in his interactions with Bianca Castafiore, with whom he is smitten during her long stay at Marlinspike Hall in The Castafiore Emerald. During her stay, his botanic experiments lead him to create a new variety of rose, which he names in her honour. Nonetheless, he happily congratulates Captain Haddock on his \"engagement\" to Castafiore (in fact a media hoax which he unwittingly fuelled)./nCalculus is also distressed by Castafiore's imprisonment in Tintin and the Picaros, and is adamant on going to her defence. In the same book, he is charmed by the unattractive Peggy Alcazar (wife of General Alcazar) and kisses her hand after she bluntly criticizes Tintin and Haddock (a remark that Calculus mistakes for a warm greeting)./nCalculus also featured frequently in the 1957\u20131963 Belvision TV series, as well as in other adaptations of the comics. The Belvision TV series is notable for depicting Calculus with perfect hearing./nCalculus' original French name was \"Tournesol\" which is the French term for sunflower. In the 1970s and 1980s, he starred in a series of cartoon television commercials for Fruit d'or products which included cooking oil and mayonnaise made from sunflower oil. Some of the ads would conclude with him floating up into the air to demonstrate how they kept a good healthy balance.

She graduated with distinction in physics from University of Cape Town in 1929, and then studied in Berlin with the nuclear physicist Lise Meitner in 1930\u201332, publishing a prize-winning[4] paper on delta rays produced by alpha particles in 1933.[5] In 1932, she returned to South Africa to marry the (later) renowned bacteriologist Max Sterne,[6] the inventor of the most effective livestock vaccine for anthrax. Because married women were not then permitted to work at University, Tikvah and Max established a home laboratory where they worked together. Their sons, Jonathan and Michael, were born in 1935 and 1936. From then on, Tikvah Alper combined demands of motherhood (Jonathan was born profoundly deaf), marriage and career. These included pre- and post-war spells in England, where she worked with the pioneer radiobiologist, Douglas Lea.[7] Over ten years from 1937, Tikvah retrained and then also worked as a teacher of the deaf. Her physics training and technical skills were evident in her published research on making speech articulation visible, for use in speech training for deaf children[8] She became head of the Biophysics section of the South African National Physics Laboratory in 1948./nDespite their growing scientific renown, in 1951, Max Sterne and Tikvah Alper were forced to leave South Africa because of their outspoken opposition to apartheid. Tikvah found an (unpaid) research post at the MRC Radiobiology Laboratories at the Hammersmith Hospital, London, directed by Hal Gray, whom she had met on earlier visits. Here, work focussed on the mechanisms of the effects of radiation on cell biology. The complexities of the effects of radiation on different cell types, and their interaction with other physiological and chemical processes began to be mapped out at this time, and continued through the 1950s and 60s. She was Director of the Radiobiology Unit from 1962 until her retirement in 1974. Her classic text Cellular Radiobiology[9] was published in 1979. Tikvah Alper continued an active professional life in retirement, culminating in a \"brilliant lecture to the Radiation Research Society in Dallas, USA at the age of 83..\".[4][10] She died in Sarisbury, Hampshire, England, in 1995,[11] and was survived by her husband Max, sons Jonathan and Michael, six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren./nScrapie is a fatal infectious disease of the neural system of sheep; one of a class of brain diseases that can affect cattle (BSE) and humans (Kuru, nCJD). Scrapie had been thought to be caused by a 'slow virus' \u2013 one that could take years to show as a change in behaviour or movement. By the mid-1960s, it was established that cells could only replicate via DNA. Radioactivity stops cell replication by 'killing' DNA. Alper found that radiation did not kill the infective agent in scrapie, suggesting that a virus was unlikely to be the infective agent. The infective agent had to be smaller and simpler than (viral) DNA. Alper also found that the agent remained active under ultraviolet light. DNA is inactive under UV light. Instead, the agent was killed by light at 237\u00a0nm, a wavelength specific to polysaccharide inactivation. Alper and colleagues[12] reported these properties of the scrapie agent \u2013 a finding that was greeted with astonishment in many quarters, for it appeared to contravene the central dogma that holds that replication (and hence the growth of the disease and its infectious properties) can only proceed via DNA. However, once these empirical findings were accepted, several theories developed to accommodate the peculiar properties of the scrapie agent. The most widely accepted theory today is the prion theory, which posits a 'rogue' protein as the infectious source. However, Alper could not accept that a protein 'mutation' was the agent. Firstly, her UV radiation studies did not indicate a protein agent and, secondly, isolated prions did not induce scrapie. Her own theories concerning the agent were developed in the last years of her life and suggested a more dynamic and complex story.[13]", "51813630": "Elsie Akosua Biraa Effah Kaufmann FGA, FBSE, FGhIE, PE (born 7 September 1969)[1][2] is a Ghanaian academic, academic administrator, biomedical engineer, and current host of the National Science and Maths Quiz.[3][4][5] In December 2020, Elsie Kaufmann was appointed an associate professor at the University of Ghana,[6] and was appointed the Dean of the School of Engineering Sciences on 1 August 2022.[7]/nThe daughter of educators, she hails from Assin in the Central Region.[8] Her father, Yusuf K.

Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, Knox eventually partnered with anatomist and former teacher John Barclay and became a lecturer on anatomy in the city, where he introduced the theory of transcendental anatomy. However, Knox's incautious methods of obtaining cadavers for dissection before the passage of the Anatomy Act 1832 and disagreements with professional colleagues ruined his career in Scotland. Following these developments, he moved to London, though this did not revive his career./nKnox's views on humanity gradually shifted over the course of his lifetime, as his initially positive views (influenced by the ideals of \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire) gave way to a more pessimistic view. Knox also devoted the latter part of his career to studying and theorising on evolution and ethnology; during this period, he also wrote numerous works advocating scientific racism. His work on the latter further harmed his legacy and overshadowed his contributions to evolutionary theory, which he used to account for racial differences./nRobert Knox was born in 1791[1] in Edinburgh's North Richmond Street, the eighth child of Mary (n\u00e9e Scherer) and Robert Knox (d. 1812), a teacher of mathematics and natural philosophy at Heriot's Hospital in Edinburgh. As an infant, he contracted smallpox, which destroyed his left eye and disfigured his face.[2] He was educated at the Royal High School of Edinburgh,[3] where he was remembered as a 'bully' who thrashed his contemporaries \"mentally and corporeally\". He won the Lord Provost's gold medal in his final year.[4]/nIn 1810, he joined medical classes at the University of Edinburgh. He soon became interested in transcendentalism[5] and the work of Xavier Bichat.[6] He was twice president of the Royal Physical Society, an undergraduate club to which he presented papers on hydrophobia and nosology.[7] The final recorded event of his university years was his just failing the anatomy examination. Knox joined the \"extramural\" anatomy class of the famous John Barclay. Barclay was an anatomist of the highest distinction, and perhaps the greatest anatomical teacher in Britain at that time. Redoubling his efforts, Knox passed competently the second time around./nKnox graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 1814, with a Latin thesis on the effects of narcotics which was published the following year.[8] He joined the army and was commissioned Hospital Assistant on 24 June 1815, after having studied for a year under John Abernethy at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London. He was sent immediately to Belgium to attend the wounded from the Battle of Waterloo and returned two weeks later with the first batch of wounded aboard a hospital ship; during the voyage he successfully employed Abernethy's technique of leaving wounds open to the air.[9] His army work at the Brussels military hospital (near Waterloo) impressed upon him the need for a comprehensive training in anatomy if surgery were to be successful. Knox was intelligent, critical and irritable. He did not suffer fools gladly and\u2014in an aside with terrible consequences for his future career\u2014he was critical of the surgical work of Charles Bell with casualties at the Battle of Waterloo. After a further trip to Belgium he was placed in charge of Hilsea hospital near Portsmouth, where he experimented with non-mercurial cures for syphilis.[10]/nIn April 1817, he joined the 72nd Highlanders and sailed with them to South Africa. There were few army surgeons in the Cape Colony but Knox found the people healthy and his duties were light. He enjoyed riding, shooting and the beauty of the landscape with which he felt in spiritual harmony\u2014an early expression of his transcendental world view.[11] Knox developed an interest in observing racial types, and disapproved of what he saw as the Boers' contempt for the indigenous peoples. However, after an abortive Xhosa rebellion against the colonial forces, he was involved in a retaliatory raid commanded by Andries Stockenstr\u00f6m, a magistrate and future Lieutenant Governor.[11][12] Relations with Stockenstr\u00f6m were marred when Knox accused O. G. Stockenstr\u00f6m, Andries' brother, of theft, a charge apparently prompted by ill feeling between British and Boer officers. A court martial acquitted O. G. of the charge and Andries called Knox's conduct shameful.[13] One of Stockenstr\u00f6m's supporters, a former naval officer named Burdett, challenged Knox to a duel. Knox initially refused to fight, and Burdett \"soundly horse whipped him on the parade before every Officer of the Garrison.\" Knox then grabbed a sabre and inflicted a slight wound to Burdett's arm. Knox's promotion to Assistant Surgeon was cancelled and he returned to Britain in disgrace, arriving on Christmas Day 1820.[14] He remained only until the following October, after which he went to Paris to study anatomy for just over a year (1821\u201322). It was then that he met both Georges Cuvier and \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, who were to remain his heroes for the rest of life, to populate his later medical journalism, and to become the subject of his hagiography, Great artists and great anatomists.[15] While in Paris he befriended Thomas Hodgkin, with whom he shared a dissecting room at l'H\u00f4pital de la Piti\u00e9.[16]/nKnox returned to Edinburgh by Christmas 1822. On 1 December 1823 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. During these years he communicated a number of well-received papers to the Royal and Wernerian societies of Edinburgh on zoological subjects, including a paper suggesting that the \"Hottentot\" or \"Bosjesman\" Khoe and San people descended from \"Mongolic\" Chinese people.[17] Soon after his election he submitted a plan to the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh for a Museum of Comparative Anatomy, which was accepted, and on 13 January 1825 he was appointed curator of the museum with a salary of \u00a3100.[18]/nIn 1825, John Barclay offered him a partnership at his anatomy school in Surgeon's Square, Edinburgh. In order for his lectures to be recognised by the Edinburgh College of Surgeons, Knox had to be admitted to its fellowship; a formality, but, at \u00a3250, an expensive one.[19] At this time most professorships were in the gift of the town council, resulting in such uninspiring teachers as the professor of anatomy Alexander Monro, who put off many of his students (including the young Charles Darwin who took the course 1825\u20131827). This created a demand for private tuition, and the flamboyant Knox\u2014in sole charge after Barclay's death in 1826\u2014had more students than all the other private tutors put together./nHe turned his sharp wit on the elders and the clergy of the city, satirising religion and delighting his students. Knox routinely referred to the Bridgewater Treatises as the \"bilgewater treatises\" and his 'continental' lectures were not for the squeamish. John James Audubon was in Edinburgh at the time to find subscribers for his Birds of America. Shown round the dissecting theatre by Knox, \"dressed in an overgown and with bloody fingers\", Audubon reported that \"The sights were extremely disagreeable, many of them shocking beyond all I ever thought could be. I was glad to leave this charnel house and breathe again the salubrious atmosphere of the streets\".[20] Knox's school flourished and he took on three assistants, Alexander Miller, Thomas Wharton Jones and William Fergusson./nLittle is known of Knox's wife, Susan Knox, whom he married in 1824.[21] According to Knox's friend Henry Lonsdale the marriage was kept secret as she was 'of inferior rank.'[22] During his time in Edinburgh, Knox lived at 4 Newington Place[23] with his sisters Mary and Jessie, while Susan and his four children lived at Lilliput Cottage in Trinity, west of Leith. They had seven children, but only two of them survived into adulthood.[24]/nBefore the Anatomy Act of 1832 widened the supply, the main legal supply of corpses for anatomical purposes in the UK were those condemned to death and dissection by the courts. This led to a chronic shortage of legitimate subjects for dissection, and this shortage became more serious as the need to train medical students grew, and the number of executions fell. In his school Knox ran up against the problem from the start, since\u2014after 1815\u2014the Royal Colleges had increased the anatomical work in the medical curriculum. If he taught according to what was known as 'French method' the ratio would have had to approach one corpse per pupil./nAs a consequence, body-snatching became so prevalent that it was not unusual for relatives and friends of someone who had just died to watch over the body until burial, and then to keep watch over the grave after burial, to stop it being violated./nIn November 1827, William Hare began a new career when an indebted lodger died on him by chance. He was paid \u00a37.10s (seven pounds & ten shillings) for delivering the body to Knox's dissecting rooms at Surgeons' Square. Now Hare and, his friend and accomplice, William Burke, set about murdering the city\u2019s poor on a regular basis. After 16 more transactions, each netting \u00a38-10, in what later became known as the West Port Murders, on 2 November 1828 Burke and Hare were caught, and the whole city convulsed with horror, fed by ballads, broadsides, and newspapers, at the reported  deeds of the pair.[25] Hare turned King's evidence, and Burke was hanged, dissected and his remains were displayed./nKnox was not prosecuted, which outraged many in Edinburgh. His house was attacked by a mob of 'the lowest rabble of the Old Town,' and windows were broken.[26] A committee of the Royal Society of Edinburgh exonerated him on the grounds that he had not dealt personally with Burke and Hare, but there was no forgetting his part in the case, and many remained wary of him./nAlmost immediately after the Burke and Hare case, the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh began to harry him, and by June 1831 they had procured his resignation as the Curator of the museum he had proposed and founded.[27] In the same year he was obliged to resign his army commission to avoid further service in the Cape.[28] This removed his last source of guaranteed income, but fortunately his classes were more popular than ever, with a record 504 students.[29] His school moved to the grander premises of Old Surgeons' Hall in 1833 but his class declined after Edinburgh University made its own practical anatomy class compulsory in the mid-1830s.[30][31] Knox continued to purchase cadavers for his dissection class from such shadowy figures as the 'Black Bull Man,' but after the 1832 Anatomy Act made bodies more available to all anatomists, he quarrelled with HM Inspector of Anatomy over the supply of bodies, and his competitive edge was lost.[32][33] In 1837 Knox applied for the chair in pathology at Edinburgh University but his candidature was blocked by eleven existing professors, who preferred to abolish the post rather than appoint him.[34] In 1842 he was unable to make payments to the Edinburgh funeratory system, from which bodies were supplied to private schools, and he relocated to Glasgow where, still short of subjects for dissection, he closed his school in 1844. In 1847 the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh found him guilty of falsifying a student's certificate of attendance (a not uncommon practice in private schools) and refused to accept any further certificates from him, effectively banning him from teaching in Scotland.[35] In the same year he was expelled from the Royal Society of Edinburgh and had his election retrospectively cancelled.[36]/nKnox left for London after the death of his wife (the remaining children were left with a nephew). He found it impossible to find a university post, and from then until 1856 he worked on medical journalism, gave public lectures, and wrote several books, including his most ambitious work, The Races of Men in which he argued that each race was suited to its environment and \"perfect in its own way.\"[37] Additionally, Knox wrote a book on fishing in Scotland, which became his best-selling work.[38] In 1854 his son Robert died of heart disease; Knox tried for a posting to the Crimea but at 63 was judged too old.[39]/nIn 1856 he became the pathological anatomist to the Free Cancer Hospital, London. He joined the medical register at its inception in 1858 and practiced obstetrics in Hackney. On 27 November 1860 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Ethnological Society of London, where he spoke in public for the last time on 1 July 1862.[40] He continued working at the Cancer Hospital until shortly before his death on 20 December 1862, at 9 Lambe Terrace in Hackney.[41] He was buried at Brookwood Cemetery near Woking, Surrey.[42]/nKnox's interest in race began as an undergraduate. His relevant political views were radical: he was an abolitionist and anti-colonialist who criticised the Boer as \"the cruel oppressor of the dark races.\"[11]:\u200a99\u200a Knox is generally considered to be a polygenist;[43][44][45] however, some have argued that he was a monogenist,[46] including biographer Alan Bates, who considers such claims to be \"exaggerated\".[47] Robert Knox once wrote that he believed all human races to descend from an original 'Caucasian' race.[48] In his best-selling work, The Races of Men (1850), a \"Zoological history\" of mankind, Knox exaggerated supposed racial differences in support of his project, asserting that, anatomically and behaviourally, \"race, or hereditary descent, is everything\". He offered crude characterisations of each racial group: for example the Saxon (in which race he included himself) \"invents nothing\", \"has no musical ear\", lacks \"genius\", and is so \"low and boorish\" that \"he does not know what you mean by fine art\".[11]:\u200a45\u200a No race was without its redeeming features, however; Knox described Saxons as \"[t]houghtful, plodding, industrious beyond all other races, [and] a lover of labour for labour's sake\".[11]:\u200a45\u200a Such supposed racial characteristics meant that each race was naturally fitted for a particular environment and could not endure outside of it. While Knox maintained that all races were capable of some form of civilized life, he maintained that a vast gulf stood between the limited attainments available to the 'negroid' and to most 'mongoloid' races on one hand and the much greater past achievements and future potential of white men on the other. The Black, Knox remarked, 'is no more a white man than an ass is a horse or a zebra'.[49]:\u200a99\u200a Ultimately however, all races were \"[d]estined ... to run, like all other animals, a certain limited course of existence\", it mattering \"little how their extinction is brought about\".[49]:\u200a302\u200a In 1862 Knox took the opportunity of a second edition of The Races of Men to defend the \"much maligned races\" of the Cape against accusations of cannibalism, and to rebuke the Dutch for treating them like \"wild beasts\".[50]/nFrom the perspective of a Lowland Scot Protestant, Knox's racist works espoused extreme racial hostility to Celts in general (including the Highland Scots and Welsh people, but particularly the Irish people).[51] Due to what he observed to be a prevalence of the \"peculiar Mongol face\" in many Highland Scots, Knox once suggested that he considered Highland Scots to descend from an early migration of \"Mongol races\".[52] He considered the \"Caledonian Celt\" as touching \"the end of his career: they are reduced to about one hundred and fifty thousand\" and that the \"Welsh Celts are not troublesome, but might easily become so.\" For Knox, \"the Irish Celt is the most to be dreaded\" and openly advocated their ethnic cleansing around the time that the Great Famine was happening, stating in The Races of Men: A Fragment (1850): \"The source of all evil lies in the race, the Celtic race of Ireland. There is no getting over historical facts. Look at Wales, look at Caledonia; it is ever the same. [...] The race must be forced from the soil; by fair means, if possible; still they must leave. The Orange club of Ireland is a Saxon confederation for the clearing the land of all Papists and Jacobites; this means Celts. If left to themselves, they would clear them out, as Cromwell proposed, by the sword; it would not require six weeks to accomplish the work. But the Encumbered Estates Relief Bill will do it better.\"[53]/nIn his writings Knox synthesised a perspective on nature from three of the most influential natural historians of his time. From Cuvier, he took a consciousness of the great epochs of time, of the fact of extinction, and of the inadequacy of the biblical account. From \u00c9tienne Geoffroy St-Hilaire and Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville, he gained a spatial and thematic perspective on living things. If one had the skill, all living beings could be arranged in their correct placing in a notional table, and one would see both internally and externally the elegant variation of their organs and anatomy according to the principles of connection, unity of composition and compensation./nGoethe is another crucial addition to the Knoxian way of looking at nature. Goethe thought that there were transcendental archetypes in the living world which could be perceived by genus. If the natural historian were perspicacious enough to examine the creatures in this correct order he could perceive\u2014aesthetically\u2014the archetype that was immanent in the totality of a series, although present in none of them./nKnox wrote that he was concerned to prove the existence of a generic animal, \"or in other terms, proving hereditary descent to have a relation primarily to genus or natural family\". This way, he could lay claim to a stability in the natural order at the level of the genus, but let species be extinguished. Man was a genus; not a species./nAccording to Richards, The Races of Men advocated \"a common material origin of life and its evolution by a process of saltatory descent\"; that is to say, new species arose not by gradual change but by sudden leaps due to shifts in embryonic development.[54] Knox tentatively concluded that \"simple animals ... may have produced by continuous generation the more complex animals of after ages . . . the fish of the early world may have produced reptiles, then again birds and quadrupeds; lastly, man himself?\" Newly formed species survived or perished according to external conditions, which acted as \"potent checks to an infinite variety of forms\". For one contemporary reviewer, his claim that \"Species is the product of external circumstances, acting through millions of years\" was \"bold, disgusting, and gratuitous atheism.\" In modern terms, he proposed a theory of saltatory evolution, in which \"deformations\" in embryonic development produced \"hopeful monsters\" that, if fortuitously suited to the prevailing environmental conditions, gave rise to new species in a single, macroevolutionary leap. In 1857 he wrote: \"The conversion of one of these species into another cannot be so difficult a matter with Nature, especially when all or most of the specific characters are already present in the young. Thus a given species may perish, but another of the same consanguinit\u00e9 takes its place in space: it is a question of time... Thus parent\u00e9 extends from species to genus and from genus to class and order, in characters not to be misunderstood.\"/nKnox is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of African lizard, Meroles knoxii.[55]", "45063467": "David Mahan Knipe is the Higgins Professor of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics in the Department of Microbiology at the Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts[1] and co-chief editor of the reference book Fields Virology.[2]  He returned to the Chair of the Program in Virology at Harvard Medical School in 2019, having previously held the position from 2004 through 2016 and served as interim Co-Chair of the Microbiology and Immunobiology Department from 2016 through 2018./nKnipe was educated at Case Western Reserve University, receiving a B.A. summa cum laude in biology in 1972.  At CWRU, he conducted research with Dr. Robert D. Goldman and showed that microfilaments in mammalian cells were actin filaments through the binding of purified heavy meromyosin to decorate the microfilaments in permeabilized cells.[3]  He continued his studies in cell biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, earning his Ph.D. in 1976; his thesis research focused on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) under the supervision of Dr. David Baltimore and Dr. Harvey Lodish.  Knipe first separated and translated the VSV mRNAs in vitro to identify their coding potential.  He then showed that the VSV glycoprotein (G) and membrane (M) proteins are assembled into virions by two separate pathways.  The pathway for G protein helped defined the secretory pathway for membrane glycoprotein assembly and the pathway for the M protein defined a cytosolic pathway for membrane protein assembly.[4][5][6][7]/nFollowing the completion of his graduate studies, he trained as post-doctoral fellow on molecular genetics of herpes simplex virus (HSV) at the University of Chicago with Dr. Bernard Roizman.  Knipe developed a cotransfection method for marker rescue mapping of mutations and introduction of new sequences into the HSV genome and showed that the ICP4 gene mapped in the repeated sequences of the short component of the viral genome.[8]  This methodology was used to map viral glycoproteins, plaque morphology, and drug resistance markers, and to construct a genital herpes vaccine candidate.[9]/nIn 1979, Knipe joined the faculty at Harvard Medical School as an assistant professor of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics and established his own lab to study HSV.  He showed that HSV replicates its DNA in defined compartments in the infected cell nucleus.[10][11]  They further showed that the viral genome associated with the nuclear lamina for immediate-early transcription.  This work revealed that intranuclear proteins are localized to specific sites to carry out their functions, much as cytoplasmic proteins were known to localize to specific sites.  This led to new areas of study of intranuclear compartmentalization of DNA virus replication.  Knipe's research has shown that host cell DNA repair and recombination proteins are localized to the viral replication compartments and that some of these inhibit viral replication while some are essential for viral replication.[12]  He discovered the molecular basis of herpes simplex virus lytic and latent infection through the definition of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in which: viral proteins promote euchromatin modifications on viral chromatin and transcription of lytic genes in epithelial cells; and the viral latency-associated transcript promotes heterochromatin modifications on viral chromatin and silencing of lytic genes in neurons.[13][14][15]  He defined the structure of viral chromatin during latent infection of neurons and the mechanisms by which viral DNA is kept silenced during latent infection.[16][17][18]  He has also defined the cellular proteins that recognize herpesviral DNA in the nucleus and initiate innate signaling and restrict viral gene expression and identified viral proteins that block host innate responses.[19][20][21][22]  His work has shown that replication-defective viruses can serve as a genital herpes vaccine and as a vaccine vector\u2014one of these genital herpes vaccines, HSV-529, is the leading candidate in phase I clinical trials.[9][23][24]/nKnipe has received several honors and awards including:/nKnipe is married to Suzanne Knipe; they have two daughters and four grandchildren.", "67509548": "Eve Billing (1923\u20132019) was a UK plant pathologist specialising in diseases of fruit trees especially fire blight caused by Erwinia amylovora bacteria.

David Mech spent 25 summers observing wolves...\"[5] on Ellesmere Island.  Mech said that his research on the wolves at Ellesmere Island was different because it is  one of the few places where the wolves are not afraid of people, making that experience one of the best in his life.[6]  This project  in 1986 when photographer Jim Brandenburg told him of white wolves he had seen on Ellesmere Island during an assignment for National Geographic.[4] Mech recognized the rare  opportunity to study wolves that had never been hunted and had little fear of humans.  Also there were no trees or bushes to hide them from view in the tundra.  In the summer Mech found the den near the military and weather base at Eureka.  They witnessed the interactions within the family unit and the wolves hunting musk oxen.  This type of research had not been done before. In an interview Mech said \"The kind of stuff I got here was not just the objective behavioral stuff, but the kind of thing you get from living with a pet of some sort. You get an insight into the thing.

He was the Deputy Reich Health Leader (Reichsgesundheitsf\u00fchrer) and Plenipotentiary for Cancer Research in the Reich Research Council. In his autobiography Arzt im Kampf (A Physician's Struggle), he equated medical and military power in their battle for life and death./nBlome was tried at the Doctors' Trial in 1947 on charges of practicing euthanasia and conducting experiments on humans. He only admitted that he had been ordered in 1943 to experiment with plague vaccines on concentration camp prisoners. In reality, starting in 1943 he \"assumed responsibility for all research into biological warfare sponsored by the Wehrmacht\" and the SS.[1] Although he was acquitted of war crimes charges at the Nuremberg Doctors' Trial, this was mainly due to the intervention of the United States as his earlier admissions were well known. It was generally accepted that he had indeed participated in chemical and biological warfare experiments on concentration camp inmates.[2]/nAfter attending elementary school and secondary school in Dortmund , Blome graduated from high school in 1912 and then studied medicine. He served in the German Army during World War I. In 1918 or 1919, Blome joined the Freikorps. He also joined Marinebrigade Ehrhardt and Organisation Consul. In 1920, he participated in the Kapp Putsch, in which he was wounded. Blome was an early member of the Nazi Party, which he joined in 1922, and the Sturmabteilung.[3][4]/nAs Plenipotentiary for Cancer Research in the Third Reich, Blome had a longstanding interest in the \"military use of carcinogenic substances\" and cancer-causing viruses. According to Ute Deichmann's book Biologists under Hitler, in 1942 he became director of a unit affiliated with the Central Cancer Institute at the University of Posen (Pozna\u0144 in Poland, annexed by Germany in 1939). Although he claimed that the work at this institute involved only 'defensive' measures against biological weapons, Heinrich Himmler, Hermann Goering, and Erich Schumann, head of the Wehrmacht's Science Section, strongly supported the offensive use of chemical and biological weapons against Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States. In 1943, Schumann wrote to Dr. Heinrich Kliewe, one of the Wehrmacht's biological warfare experts that \"in particular, America must be attacked simultaneously with various human and animal epidemic pathogens as well as plant pests.\"[5] According to Kliewe, plague, typhoid, cholera and anthrax were being developed as weapons, as well as a new \"synthetic medium for the spread of these bacteria\" which would allow them to remain virulent for eight to twelve weeks.[6]/nAs part of the Nazi biological warfare program code-named Blitzableiter (Lightning Rod), Blome's institute was therefore \"a camouflaged operation for the production of biological warfare agents\", and its construction was overseen by Karl I. Gross, an S.S. officer and specialist in tropical diseases, who had conducted lethal experiments on 1,700 prisoners at the Mauthausen concentration camp.[7] It was surrounded by a ten-foot high wall, guarded by a special S.S. unit, and designed to prevent the accidental release of the various biological agents being produced there. By May 1944, the institute had sections devoted to physiology-biology, bacteriology and vaccines, radiology, pharmacology, cancer statistics and a tumor farm, and had received at least 2.7 million Reichsmarks in funding from the Wehrmacht and S.S. in 1943\u201345.[8]/nBlome worked on methods of storage and dispersal of biological agents like plague, cholera, anthrax, and typhoid, and also infected prisoners with plague in order to test the efficacy of vaccines. At the University of Strassburg, a \"special unit\" headed by Prof. Eugen von Haagan and employing researchers like Kurt Gutzeit and Arnold Dohmen, tested typhus, hepatitis, nephritis, and other chemical and biological weapons on concentration camp inmates.[9] Gutzeit was in charge of hepatitis research for the German Army, and he and his colleagues carried out virus experiments on mental patients, Jews, Russian POWs and Gypsies in Sachsenhausen, Auschwitz and other locations.[10] In October 1944, Himmler also ordered Blome to experiment with plague on concentration camp prisoners.[11]/nIn 1943, Blome proposed spreading malaria \"artificially by means of mosquitoes\" and experimented on prisoners at Dachau and Buchenwald with lice in order to cause typhus epidemics.[12] Eduard May, director of the Entomological Division of the SS Institute for Practical Research in Military Science, received a commission to experiment on concentration camp prisoners with \"humanly harmful insects\" starting in October 1943, which was closely connected with Blome's biological warfare program.[13] May collaborated with him in experiments on \"the artificial mass transmission of the malaria parasite to humans\", with infected mosquitoes dropped from planes. In addition, the Wehrmacht's Veterinary Section, which included research projects on animal diseases being conducted by Erich Traub at the Insel Riems (Riems Island) Institute, was developing methods to spread these by aircraft over Britain, the U.S. and the Soviet Union.[14] Like Kurt Blome's cancer research institute in Posen, the State Research Institute at Insel Riems was a dual use facility during the Second World War where at least some biological warfare experiments were conducted. It was founded in 1909\u201310 to study foot-and-mouth disease and by World War II employed about 20 scientists and a staff of about 70\u2013120. From 1919 to 1948, its director was Otto Waldmann. Hans-Christoph Nagel, a veterinarian and biological warfare expert for the German Army, was in charge of research into the use of animal and insect diseases as biological weapons. Like Blome, Traub was also employed by the U.S. government after the war as a biological warfare expert.[15]/nBlome also worked on aerosol dispersants and methods of spraying nerve agents like Tabun and Sarin from aircraft, and tested the effects of these gases on prisoners at Auschwitz.[11] I.G. Farben had developed nerve gas in 1936 as a result of its research into insecticides, and Blome's duties included preparing defensive measures against possible Allied use of insect-borne biological weapons, either in a first strike or in retaliation for German use of such weapons. As early as September 1940, Wolfram Sievers, director of the S.S. Ahnenerbe Institute, had warned Blome of the need to expand the production of insecticides to deal with this eventuality.[16] This led Blome to experiment with the dispersal of insecticides, fungicides and nerve gas from aircraft, especially after Hitler had ordered a \"drastic increase\" in the production of Tabun and Sarin at I.G. Farben's Dyhernfurth factory in eastern Germany. On orders from Himmler in 1944, Blome also tested these on inmates at Auschwitz.[17]/nBlome fled from Posen in January 1945 just ahead of the Red Army, and was unable to have the facilities completely destroyed. He informed Walter Schreiber, head of the Wehrmacht's Military Medical Inspectorate, that he was \"very concerned that the installations for human experiments that were in the institute and recognizable as such, would be very easily identified by the Russians.\"[18] He relocated to the town of Geraberg in Thuringia, where the Wehrmacht and SS had already constructed another biological warfare facility disguised as a cancer research institute. Blome brought his biological cultures with him from Poland, and was still promising Hitler a Wunderwaffe or 'miracle weapon' that would turn the tide of war in Germany's favor, but the Geraburg facility was captured by the U.S. Army in April 1945, along with its records and equipment.[19]/nThroughout the war, the German and Japanese biological warfare programs exchanged information, samples, and equipment by submarine. The last of these submarines departed from Japan as late as May 1945. The Japanese destroyed many of the records about these contacts and the biological warfare program prior to their own surrender in August 1945. In the 1930s, Hitler had ordered a group of officers led by Otto Muntsch to study Japan's use of chemical and biological weapons against China. These programs of scientific cooperation and exchange were formalized in a series of agreements in 1938\u201339. Hojo Enryo, a Japanese Army doctor and expert in biological weapons \"frequently visited the Robert Koch Institute as well as companies under German occupation to collect information about research on bacteriological warfare\" and gave a lecture on this subject at the Berlin Military Academy of Medicine in October 1941.[20] Gerhard Rose, who was \"the German expert on tropical diseases and epidemic typhus\" and later a defendant at the Nuremberg Doctors Trial, supplied samples of the yellow fever virus to Unit 731 that they had been unable to obtain from the United States.[21] Blome's own institute in Posen was very similar in design to Unit 731's facility in Pingfan, Manchuria.[22]/nBlome was arrested in Munich on 17 May 1945 by the United States Counter Intelligence Corps (an army intelligence service). He had no papers except his driving licence. After some weeks of custody, during which the CIC checked on his identity, Blome was taken to Kransberg Castle (a medieval castle north of Frankfurt). After his arrival at the castle a secret message was transmitted to Operation Alsos, an Anglo-American team of experts, tasked with investigating the state of German and Italian weapons technology towards the end of the war:/nIn 1943 Blome was studying bacteriological warfare, although officially he was involved in cancer research, which was however only a camouflage. Blome additionally served as deputy health minister of the Reich. Would like you to send investigators?\"[23]/nIt is believed that American intervention saved Blome from the gallows in exchange for information about biological warfare, nerve gas, and providing advice on to the American chemical and biological weapons programs.[24] In November 1947, two months after his Nuremberg acquittal, Blome was interviewed by four representatives from Camp Detrick, Maryland, including H.W. Batchelor, in which he \"identified biological warfare experts and their location and described different methods of conducting biological warfare.\"[25]/nBlome was hired by Sidney Gottlieb to work on the MK-Ultra program.[26]/nIn 1951, he was hired by the U.S. Army Chemical Corps under Project 63, one of the successors to Operation Paperclip, to work on chemical warfare. His file neglected to mention Nuremberg. Denied a visa by the U.S. Consul in Frankfurt, he was employed at European Command Intelligence Center at Oberursel, West Germany.[27] He worked there on a never-declassified top secret project labeled in Blome's foreign scientist case file as \"Army, 1952, Project 1975\".[28]/nHe was not arrested or charged with war crimes again after his acquittal at the Nuremberg Doctors' Trial in 1947. He also continued to practice medicine in West Germany, and was active in politics as a member of the national-conservative German Party.

She published many monographs on the collections of the Natural History Museum[6] and novel specimens deposited in the museum from various dredges.[7] She also identified 34 species of sponge new to science from the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition.[8] Stephens took part in the Clare Island Survey in 1909 and 1910, surveying the fresh and marine sponges as well as other marine invertebrates.[9] She worked extensively with her fellow museum worker, Eileen Barnes, an artist who illustrated many of Stephens' publications./nIn 1920 Stephens married Robert Francis Scharff, who was the then acting Director of the National Museum of Ireland and Keeper of the Natural History Division. Due to the marriage bar in Ireland, Stephens had to resign her post in the Museum.[10] Once retired, Stephens appears to have stopped any scientific research,[11] which was not unusual for married women at that time.[12] They had one daughter, Marjorie Patience, born in 1921. Scharff subsequently retired in 1921 and the family moved to Worthing, where Scharff died in 1934. Stephens died in 1959 in London.[13] The lack of an obituary to Stephens has been attributed to the fact that she outlived many of those she worked with during her 15-year career in Ireland,[4] such as Matilda Cullen Knowles, Eileen Barnes and Robert Lloyd Praeger.", "204127": "Charles Bonnet (French: [b\u0254n\u025b]; 13 March 1720 \u2013 20 May 1793) was a Genevan[1] naturalist and philosophical writer. He is responsible for coining the term phyllotaxis to describe the arrangement of leaves on a plant.[2] He was among the first to notice parthenogenetic reproduction in aphids and established that insects respired through their spiracles. He was among the first to use the term \"evolution\" in a biological context. Deaf from an early age, he also suffered from failing eyesight and had to make use of assistants in later life to help in his research./nBonnet was born in Geneva, the son of Pierre Bonnet and Anne-Marie Lullin de Ch\u00e2teauvieux. Although originally from France, the family had been driven into Geneva by religious persecution of Protestants in the 16th century. At age seven he lost his hearing, which pushed him into an interest in the natural world.[3] His schoolmates troubled him due to the hearing handicap and the parents took him out and had a private tutor.[citation needed] Bonnet seems never to have left the Geneva region, and does not appear to have taken any part in public affairs except for the period between 1752 and 1768, during which he was a member of the council of the republic. The last twenty five years of his life he spent quietly in the country, at Genthod, near Geneva, where he died after a long and painful illness on 20 May 1793. His wife was a lady of the family of De la Rive. They had no children, but Madame Bonnet's nephew, the celebrated Horace-B\u00e9n\u00e9dict de Saussure, was brought up as their son.[4]/nBonnet made law his profession, but his favourite pursuit was the study of natural science. The account of the ant-lion in No\u00ebl-Antoine Pluche's Spectacle de la nature, which he read in his sixteenth year, turned his attention to insect life. He procured RAF de R\u00e9aumur's work on insects, and with the help of live specimens succeeded in adding many observations to those of R\u00e9aumur and Pluche. In 1740, Bonnet communicated to the Academy of Sciences a paper containing a series of experiments establishing what is now termed parthenogenesis in aphids or tree-lice, which obtained for him the honour of being admitted as the youngest corresponding member of the academy.[4] During that year he had been in correspondence with his uncle Abraham Trembley who had recently discovered the hydra. This little creature became the hit of all the salons across Europe once philosophers and natural scientists saw its amazing regenerative capabilities.[5]  In 1741, Bonnet began to study reproduction by fusion and the regeneration of lost parts in the freshwater hydra and other animals; and in the following year he discovered that the respiration of caterpillars and butterflies is performed by pores, to which the name spiracles has since been given. In 1743, he was admitted a fellow of the Royal Society; and in the same year he became a doctor of laws\u2014his last act in connection with a profession which had ever been distasteful to him.[4] In 1753, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and on 15 December 1769 a foreign member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters.[6]/nHis first published work appeared in 1745, entitled Trait\u00e9 d'insectologie, in which were collected his various discoveries regarding insects, along with a preface on the development of germs and the scale of organized beings. Botany, particularly the leaves of plants, next attracted his attention; and after several years of diligent study, rendered irksome by the increasing weakness of his eyesight, he published in 1754 one of the most original and interesting of his works, Recherches sur l'usage des feuilles dans les plantes (Research on the use of leaves in plants). In this book, he observes that gas bubbles form on plant leaves that have been submerged in water, indicating gas exchange; and among other things he advances many considerations tending to show (as was later done by Francis Darwin) that plants are endowed with powers of sensation and discernment. But Bonnet's eyesight, which threatened to fail altogether, caused him to turn to philosophy. In 1754 his Essai de psychologie was published anonymously in London. This was followed by the Essai analytique sur les facult\u00e9s de l'\u00e2me (Analytical essay on the faculties of the soul) (Copenhagen, 1760), in which he develops his views regarding the physiological conditions of mental activity. He returned to physical science, but to the speculative side of it, in his Considerations sur les corps organis\u00e9es (Amsterdam, 1762), designed to refute the theory of epigenesis, and to explain and defend the doctrine of pre-existent germs. In his Contemplation de la nature (Amsterdam, 1764\u20131765; translated into Italian, German, English and Dutch), one of his most popular and delightful works, he sets forth, in eloquent language, the theory that all the beings in nature form a gradual scale rising from lowest to highest, without any break in its continuity. His last important work was the Paling\u00e9n\u00e9sie philosophique (Geneva, 1769\u20131770); in it he treats of the past and future of living beings, and supports the idea of the survival of all animals, and the perfecting of their faculties in a future state. Bonnet's complete works appeared at Neuch\u00e2tel in 1779\u20131783, partly revised by himself.[4]/nIn 1760 he described a condition now called Charles Bonnet Syndrome,[7]  in which vivid, complex visual hallucinations (fictive visual percepts) occur in psychologically normal people. He documented it in his 87-year-old grandfather,[8] who was nearly blind from cataracts in both eyes but perceived men, women, birds, carriages, buildings, tapestries and scaffolding patterns. Most people affected are elderly with visual impairments, however the phenomenon does not occur only in the elderly or in those with visual impairments; it can also be caused by damage elsewhere in their optic pathway or brain./nBonnet's philosophical system may be outlined as follows. Man is a compound of two distinct substances, mind and body, the one immaterial and the other material. All knowledge originates in sensations; sensations follow (whether as physical effects or merely as sequents Bonnet will not say) vibrations in the nerves appropriate to each; and lastly, the nerves are made to vibrate by external physical stimulus. A nerve once set in motion by a particular object tends to reproduce that motion; so that when it a second time receives an impression from the same object it vibrates with less resistance. The sensation accompanying this increased flexibility in the nerve is, according to Bonnet, the condition of memory. When reflection\u2014that is, the active element in mind\u2014is applied to the acquisition and combination of sensations, those abstract ideas are formed which, though generally distinguished from, are thus merely sensations in combination only. That which puts the mind into activity is pleasure or pain; happiness is the end of human existence.[4]/nBonnet's metaphysical theory is based on two principles borrowed from Leibniz: first, that there are not successive acts of creation, but that the universe is completed by the single original act of the divine will, and thereafter moves on by its own inherent force; and secondly, that there is no break in the continuity of existence. The divine Being originally created a multitude of germs in a graduated scale, each with an inherent power of self-development[citation needed]. At every successive step in the progress of the universe, these germs, as progressively modified, advance nearer to perfection; if some advanced and others did not there would be a gap in the continuity of the chain. Thus not man only but all other forms of existence are immortal[citation needed]. Nor is man's mind alone immortal; his body also will pass into the higher stage, not, indeed, the body he now possesses, but a finer one of which the germ at present exists within him. It is impossible, however, to reach absolute perfection, because the distance is infinite.[4]/nIn this final proposition, Bonnet violates his own principle of continuity, by postulating an interval between the highest created being and the Divine[citation needed]. It is also difficult to understand whether the constant advance to perfection is performed by each individual, or only by each race of beings as a whole. There seems, in fact, to be an oscillation between two distinct but analogous doctrines\u2014that of the constantly increasing advancement of the individual in future stages of existence, and that of the constantly increasing advancement of the race as a whole according to the successive evolutions of the globe.[4] In Philosophical Palingesis, or Ideas on the Past and Future States of Living Beings (1770), Bonnet argued that females carry within them all future generations in a miniature form. He believed these miniature beings, sometimes called homonculi, would be able to survive even great cataclysms such as the biblical Flood; he predicted, moreover, that these catastrophes brought about evolutionary change, and that after the next disaster, men would become angels, mammals would gain intelligence, and so on.[citation needed]/nBonnet had an influence on other philosophers and pre-evolutionary thinkers; James Burnett, Lord Monboddo is known to have studied his publications on insects and to have been influenced as he developed concepts on progression of species (evolution).[9][10]", "40803679": "Nora Lilian Alcock, also known as Nora Lilian Lepart[1] and Nora Lilian Leopard,[2] (18 August 1874 \u2013 31 March 1972) was a pioneer in the field of plant pathology and the first government-appointed plant pathologist in Scotland./nNora Lilian Scott was born in 1874, the daughter of Sir John Scott,[3] the Judicial Advisor to the Khedive of Egypt, and Edgeworth Leonora Hill. It appears she had no formal higher education. She married Nathaniel Henry Alcock, a radiologist, in 1905 and moved to Canada. When he died of cancer in 1913, she and her four children returned to Britain.[4]/nUpon her return to London, Alcock obtained a post at the Plant Pathology Laboratory of the Ministry of Agriculture, Kew Gardens.[4] During her appointment, Alcock developed expertise in mycology under the directorships of Sir John Fryer, John Ramsbottom, and Professor Dame Helen Gwynne-Vaughan.[5] Alcock became a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1922, and in 1924, she moved to Edinburgh for the position of plant pathologist in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.[4] Her post was based at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh and focused on using healthy seeds to increasing food production.[5] She retired in 1937.[5] The following year she visited Australia, where she spent six months studying local flora.[6]/nAs a result of her research on fungal diseases, in particular red core disease in strawberries, Alcock was awarded an MBE in 1935. Her work developed disease-resistant strains and catalogued seed-borne diseases.[4]/nIn 1924 Alcock became the first person to hold the new post of Plant Pathologist in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.[4]/nHer biography was written by Charles Edward Foister.[4]/nA memorial plaque dedicated to Alcock can be found at the Royal Botanic Gardens of Edinburgh.[7]/nDuring the Second World War, she taught botany to prisoners of war. She was a member of the National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs and the Edinburgh Soroptimists.[5]", "105825": "Dorothy Mary Crowfoot Hodgkin OM FRS HonFRSC[10][11] (n\u00e9e Crowfoot; 12 May 1910 \u2013 29 July 1994) was a Nobel Prize-winning English chemist who advanced the technique of X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of biomolecules, which became essential for structural biology.[10][12]/nAmong her most influential discoveries are the confirmation of the structure of penicillin as previously surmised by Edward Abraham and Ernst Boris Chain; and mapping the structure of vitamin B12, for which in 1964 she became the third woman to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Hodgkin also elucidated the structure of insulin in 1969 after 35 years of work.[13]/nHodgkin used the name \"Dorothy Crowfoot\" until twelve years after marrying Thomas Lionel Hodgkin, when she began using \"Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin\". Hodgkin is referred to as \"Dorothy Hodgkin\" by the Royal Society (when referring to its sponsorship of the Dorothy Hodgkin fellowship), and by Somerville College. The National Archives of the United Kingdom refer to her as \"Dorothy Mary Crowfoot Hodgkin\"./nDorothy Mary Crowfoot was born in Cairo, Egypt,[14] the oldest of the four daughters whose parents worked in North Africa and the middle East in the colonial administration and later as archaeologists. Dorothy came from a distinguished family of archaeologists.[15] Her parents were John Winter Crowfoot (1873\u20131959), working for the country's Ministry of Education, and his wife Grace Mary (n\u00e9e Hood) (1877\u20131957), known to friends and family as Molly.[16] The family lived in Cairo during the winter months, returning to England each year to avoid the hotter part of the season in Egypt.[17]/nIn 1914, Hodgkin's mother left her (age 4) and her two younger sisters Joan (age 2) and Elisabeth (age 7 months) with their Crowfoot grandparents near Worthing, and returned to her husband in Egypt. They spent much of their childhood apart from their parents, yet they were supportive from afar. Her mother would encourage Dorothy to pursue the interest in crystals first displayed at the age of 10. In 1923, Dorothy and her sister would study pebbles that they had found nearby streams using portable mineral analysis kit. Their parents then moved south to Sudan where, until 1926, her father was in charge of education and archaeology. Her mother's four brothers were killed in World War I and as a result she became an ardent supporter of the new League of Nations.[18][19]/nIn 1921 Hodgkin's father entered her in the Sir John Leman Grammar School in Beccles, England,[11] where she was one of two girls allowed to study chemistry.[20] Only once, when she was 13, did she make an extended visit to her parents, then living in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, where her father was Principal of Gordon College. When she was 14, her distant cousin, the chemist Charles Harington (later Sir Charles), recommended D. S. Parsons' Fundamentals of Biochemistry.[21] Resuming the pre-war pattern, her parents lived and worked abroad for part of the year, returning to England and their children for several months every summer. In 1926, on his retirement from the Sudan Civil Service, her father took the post of Director of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem, where he and her mother remained until 1935.[22]/nIn 1928, Hodgkin joined her parents at the archaeological site of Jerash, in present-day Jordan, where she documented the patterns of mosaics from multiple Byzantine-era Churches dated to the 5th\u20136th centuries. She spent more than a year finishing the drawings as she started her studies in Oxford, while also conducting chemical analyses of glass tesserae from the same site.[23] Her attention to detail through the creation of precise scale drawings of these mosaics mirrors her subsequent work in recognising and documenting patterns in chemistry. Hodgkin enjoyed the experience of field archaeology so much that she considered giving up chemistry in favour of archaeology.[24] Her drawings are archived by Yale University.[15]/nHodgkin developed a passion for chemistry from a young age, and her mother, a proficient botanist, fostered her interest in the sciences. On her 16th birthday her mother gave her a book by W. H. Bragg on X-ray crystallography, \"Concerning the Nature of Things\", which helped her decide her future.[25] She was further encouraged by the chemist A.F. Joseph, a family friend who also worked in Sudan.[26]/nHer state school education did not include Latin, then required for entrance to Oxbridge. Her Leman School headmaster gave her personal tuition in the subject, enabling her to pass the University of Oxford entrance examination.[citation needed]/nWhen Hodgkin was asked in later life to name her childhood heroes, she named three women: first and foremost, her mother, Molly; the medical missionary Mary Slessor; and Margery Fry, the Principal of Somerville College.[27]/nIn 1928 at age 18 Hodgkin entered Somerville College, Oxford, where she studied chemistry.[26] She graduated in 1932 with a first-class honours degree, the third woman at this institution to achieve this distinction.[28]/nIn the autumn of that year, she began studying for a PhD at Newnham College, Cambridge, under the supervision of John Desmond Bernal.[29] It was then that she became aware of the potential of X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of proteins. She was working with Bernal on the technique's first application to the analysis of a biological substance, pepsin.[30] The pepsin experiment is largely credited to Hodgkin, however she always made it clear that it was Bernal who initially took the photographs and gave her additional key insights.[31] Her PhD was awarded in 1937 for research on X-ray crystallography and the chemistry of  sterols.[2]/nIn 1933 Hodgkin was awarded a research fellowship by Somerville College, and in 1934, she moved back to Oxford. She started teaching chemistry with her own lab equipment. The college appointed her its first fellow and tutor in chemistry in 1936, a post which she held until 1977. In the 1940s, one of her students was Margaret Roberts (later Margaret Thatcher)[32] who, while Prime Minister, hung a portrait of Hodgkin in her office at Downing Street out of respect for her former teacher.[26] Hodgkin was, however a life-long Labour Party supporter.[33]/nIn April 1953, together with Sydney Brenner, Jack Dunitz, Leslie Orgel, and Beryl M. Oughton, Hodgkin was one of the first people to travel from Oxford to Cambridge to see the model of the double helix structure of DNA, constructed by Francis Crick and James Watson, which was based on data and technique acquired by Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin. According to the late Dr Beryl Oughton (married name, Rimmer), they drove to Cambridge in two cars after Hodgkin announced that they were off to see the model of the structure of DNA./nHodgkin became a reader at Oxford in 1957 and she was given a fully modern laboratory the following year.[34] In 1960, Hodgkin was appointed the Royal Society's Wolfson Research Professor, a position she held until 1970.[35] This provided her salary, research expenses and research assistance to continue her work at the University of Oxford. She was a fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford, from 1977 to 1983.[36]/nHodgkin was particularly noted for discovering three-dimensional biomolecular structures.[12] In 1945, working with C.H. (Harry) Carlisle, she published the first such structure of a steroid, cholesteryl iodide (having worked with cholesteryls since the days of her doctoral studies).[37]/nIn 1945, Hodgkin and her colleagues, including biochemist Barbara Low, solved the structure of penicillin, demonstrating, contrary to scientific opinion at the time, that it contains a \u03b2-lactam ring. The work was not published until 1949.[38][nb 1]/nIn 1948, Hodgkin first encountered vitamin B12,[39] one of the most structurally complex vitamins known, and created new crystals. Vitamin B12 had first been discovered at Merck earlier that year. It had a structure at the time that was almost completely unknown, and when Hodgkin discovered it contained cobalt, she realized the structure actualization could be determined by X-ray crystallography analysis. The large size of the molecule, and the fact that the atoms were largely unaccounted for\u2014aside from cobalt\u2014posed a challenge in structure analysis that had not been previously explored.[40]/nFrom these crystals, she deduced the presence of a ring structure because the crystals were pleochroic, a finding which she later confirmed using X-ray crystallography. The B12 study published by Hodgkin was described by Lawrence Bragg as being as significant \"as breaking the sound barrier\".[40][41] Scientists from Merck had previously crystallised B12, but had published only refractive indices of the substance.[42] The final structure of B12, for which Hodgkin was later awarded the Nobel Prize, was published in 1955.[43]/nInsulin was one of Hodgkin's most extraordinary research projects. It began in 1934 when she was offered a small sample of crystalline insulin by Robert Robinson. The hormone captured her imagination because of the intricate and wide-ranging effect it has in the body. However, at this stage X-ray crystallography had not been developed far enough to cope with the complexity of the insulin molecule. She and others spent many years improving the technique./nIt took 35 years after taking her first photograph of an insulin crystal for X-ray crystallography and computing techniques to be able to tackle larger and more complex molecules like insulin. Hodgkin's dream of unlocking the structure of insulin was put on hold until 1969 when she was finally able to work with her team of young, international scientists to uncover the structure for the first time. Hodgkin's work with insulin was instrumental in paving the way for insulin to be mass-produced and used on a large scale for treatment of both type one and type two diabetes.[44] She went on to cooperate with other laboratories active in insulin research, giving advice, and traveling the world giving talks about insulin and its importance for the future of diabetes. Solving the structure of insulin had two important implications for the treatment of diabetes, both making mass production of insulin possible and allowing scientists to alter the structure of insulin to create even better drug options for patients going forward.[44]/nHodgkin's soft-spoken, gentle and modest demeanor hid a steely determination to achieve her ends, whatever obstacles might stand in her way. She inspired devotion in her students and colleagues, even the most junior of whom knew her simply as Dorothy. Her structural studies of biologically important molecules set standards for a field that was very much in development during her work life. She made fundamental contributions to the understanding of how these molecules carry out their tasks in living system./nHodgkin's mentor Professor John Desmond Bernal greatly influenced her life: scientifically, politically, and personally. Bernal was a key scientific adviser to the UK government during the Second World War. He was also an open and vocal member of the Communist Party and a faithful supporter of the Soviet regime until its invasion of Hungary in 1956. He is a chemist who believed in equal opportunity for women. In his laboratory, Hodgkin extended work that he began on biological molecules including sterols. She helped him to make the first X-ray diffraction studies of pepsin and crystalline protein. Hodgkin always referred to him as \"Sage\". They were lovers before she met Thomas Hodgkin.[45] The marriages of both Dorothy and Bernal were unconventional by the standards of the present and of those days.[46]/nIn 1934, at the age of 24, Dorothy began experiencing pain in her hands causing them to become swollen and distorted. She was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, and went to a clinic in Buxton for thermal baths and gold treatments.[47] After some treatment, Hodgkin returned to the lab, where she struggled to use the main switch on the x-ray equipment due to the condition of her hands. She had to create a lever on her own in order to utilize the switch.[48] Her condition would become progressively worse and crippling over time, with deformities in both her hands and feet, and prolonged periods of pain. While Hodgkin spent a great deal of time in a wheelchair in her later years, she remained scientifically active in her career.[49]/nIn 1937, Dorothy Crowfoot married Thomas Lionel Hodgkin, an historian's son, who was then teaching an adult-education class in mining and industrial communities in the north of England after he resigned from the Colonial Office.[50]  He was an intermittent member of the Communist Party and later wrote several major works on African politics and history, becoming a well-known lecturer at Balliol College in Oxford.[51]  As his health was too poor for active military service, he continued working throughout World War II, returning to Oxford on the weekends, where his wife remained working on penicillin. The couple had three children: Luke[52] (b. 1938. d. Oct. 2020), Elizabeth[53] (b. 1941) and Toby[54] (b. 1946). The oldest son, Luke, became a mathematics instructor at the new University of Warwick. Their daughter, Elizabeth, followed her father's career as a historian. Their younger son, Toby, studied botany and agriculture. Overall, Thomas Hodgkin spent extended periods of time in West Africa, where he was enthusiastic supporter and chronicler of the emerging postcolonial states./nHodgkin published as \"Dorothy Crowfoot\" until 1949, when she was persuaded by Hans Clarke's secretary to use her married name on a chapter she contributed to The Chemistry of Penicillin. By then she had been married for 12 years, given birth to three children and been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS).[55]/nThereafter she would publish as \"Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin\", and this was the name used by the Nobel Foundation in its award to her and the biography it included among other Nobel Prize recipients;[55] it is also what the Science History Institute calls her.[56][57]  For simplicity's sake, Hodgkin is referred to as \"Dorothy Hodgkin\" by the Royal Society, when referring to its sponsorship of the Dorothy Hodgkin fellowship,[58] and by Somerville College, after it inaugurated the annual lectures in her honour./nThe National Archives of the United Kingdom refer to her as \"Dorothy Mary Crowfoot Hodgkin\"; on a variety of plaques commemorating places where she worked or lived, e.g. 94 Woodstock Road, Oxford, she is \"Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin\". In 2022, the Department of Biochemistry in Oxford renamed its much expanded building after Hodgkin, calling it the \"Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin Building\".[59]/nBetween the 1950s and the 1970s Hodgkin established and maintained lasting contacts with scientists in her field abroad\u2014at the Institute of Crystallography in Moscow; in India; and with the Chinese group working in Beijing and Shanghai on the structure of insulin./nHer first visit to China was in 1959. Over the next quarter century she travelled there seven more times, the last visit a year before her death.[60] Particularly memorable was the visit in 1971 after the Chinese group themselves independently solved the structure of insulin, later than Hodgkin's team but to a higher resolution. During the subsequent three years, 1972\u20131975, when she was President of the International Union of Crystallography she was unable to persuade the Chinese authorities, however, to permit the country's scientists to become members of the Union and attend its meetings./nHer relations with a supposed scientist in another \"People's Democracy\" had less happy results. At the age of 73, Hodgkin wrote a foreword to the English edition of Stereospecific Polymerization of Isoprene, published by Robert Maxwell as the work of Elena Ceausescu, wife of Romania's communist dictator. Hodgkin wrote of the author's  \"outstanding achievements\" and \"impressive\" career.[61] Following the overthrow of Ceausescu during the Romanian Revolution of 1989, it was revealed that Elena Ceausescu had neither finished secondary school nor attended university. Her scientific credentials were a hoax, and the publication in question was written for her by a team of scientists to obtain a fraudulent doctorate.[62]/nBecause of Hodgkin's political activities, and her husband's association with the Communist Party, she was banned from entering the US in 1953 and subsequently not allowed to visit the country except by CIA waiver.[63]/nIn 1961 Thomas became an advisor to Kwame Nkrumah, President of Ghana, a country he visited for extended periods before Nkrumah's ouster in 1966. Hodgkin was in Ghana with her husband when they received the news that she had been awarded the Nobel Prize./nShe acquired from her mother, Molly, a concern about social inequalities and a determination to do what she could to prevent armed conflict. Dorothy became particularly concerned about the threat of nuclear war. In 1976, she became president of the Pugwash Conference and served longer than any who preceded or succeeded her in this post. She stepped down in 1988, the year after the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty imposed \"a global ban on short- and long-range nuclear weapons systems, as well as an intrusive verification regime\".[4] She accepted the Lenin Peace Prize from the Soviet government in 1987 in recognition of her work for peace and disarmament./nDue to distance, Hodgkin decided not to attend the 1987 Congress of the International Union of Crystallography in Australia. However, despite increasing frailty, she astounded close friends and family by going to Beijing for the 1993 Congress, where she was welcomed by all./nShe died in July 1994 after a stroke, at her husband's home in the village of Ilmington, near Shipston-on-Stour, Warwickshire.[13]/nThe National Portrait Gallery, London lists 17 portraits of Dorothy Hodgkin[64] including an oil painting of her at her desk by Maggi Hambling[65] and a photograph portrait by David Montgomery.[66]/nGraham Sutherland made preliminary sketches for a portrait of Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin in 1978.  One sketch is in the collection of the Science History Institute and another at the Royal Society in London.  The portrait was never finished.[57][67][68]/nA portrait of Dorothy Hodgkin by Bryan Organ was commissioned by private subscription to become part of the collection of the Royal Society.

Astaurov went to the Flerov gymnasium where his contemporaries included B.V. Kedrovsky, Nikolay Timofeev-Ressovsky, Alexander Gurwitsch, and G.K. Khrushchov. Astaurov was very good at drawing and learned piano with Boris Chaliapin under professor Feodor Koenemann. After graduating in 1921 he joined the Moscow University and after receiving a degree in 1927 he went to study zoology under N. K. Koltsov. In 1926 he went to work in the laboratory of Sergei Chetverikov, to study the genetics of Drosophila populations. His studies were on the mutant tetraptera with four wings. He went to study the genetics and breeding of Arabian and Bactrian camels in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan from 1928 to 1929. His PhD could not be completed due to the arrest and deportation of Chetverikov based on the allegations made by Trofim Lysenko that Mendelian geneticists were fascists under Stalin's rule.[1] Astaurov moved to Tashkent and joined the sericulture and silk research institute there. He demonstrated artificially induced parthenogenesis in silkworm eggs. In 1936 he returned to Moscow and was able to complete his doctorate. In 1942, after the death of Dmitriy Filatov, Astaurov continued to work at the Laboratory of Developmental Mechanics in Moscow and was made head of the department from 1947. After 1948, although not directly targeted by Lysenko, he was decreed to not work on silkworm but instead to study fish. After Stalin's death, he returned to study silkworm.

With his father's tutoring, Maelstrom became a brilliant geneticist. After his father is incapacitated in an experiment, Maelstrom swears revenge on the Inhuman race and becomes a would-be conqueror./nMaelstrom has first contact with Earth's metahumans when he sends his superpowered minions\u2014Phobius, Gronk, and Helio\u2014to the scientific island facility Hydro-Base to steal an Anti-Terrigen mist compound. This substance can undo the effects of the Terrigen Mist and deprive the Inhumans of their abilities. Maelstrom's Minions, however, are defeated by heroes the Thing and Stingray. They are assisted by two Inhumans, Gorgon and Karnak. This leads to an encounter with another of Maelstrom's minions\u2014Deathurge\u2014who kills the defeated trio. Mister Fantastic and the Inhuman Triton deduce that their opponent may have originated from the old site of Attilan, which was an undersea location./nThe Thing, Gorgon and Karnak travel via submarine to the old location, and discover a base where they are subsequently captured. The heroes later escape and together with the Inhuman king Black Bolt battle Maelstrom. The heroes hold off Maelstrom while Black Bolt intercepts and defuses a missile carrying the anti-Terrigen mist compound that is programmed to destroy Attilan. The Thing weakens Maelstrom by using the compound on the villain, and the heroes escape as the base self-detonates. Maelstrom's last act is to order Deathurge to kill him.[3]/nMaelstrom and his minions, however, are later revealed to be alive, as courtesy of advanced science their minds were transferred into new, cloned bodies. Maelstrom then attempts to siphon the energies of the Eternals, but is thwarted by the superhero team the Avengers, and after commanding Deathurge to kill him yet again, transfers his consciousness to a new clone body.[4] Maelstrom then attempts to stop the Earth's rotation and absorb the kinetic energy, but is drawn into conflict with the Avengers once more. The android Vision discovers a way to overload Maelstrom's power source and his body becomes discorporate and floats free from Earth.[5]/nMaelstrom later encounters the Titanian Eternal Kronos, and learns of the existence of the entity Oblivion. Becoming Oblivion's avatar, Maelstrom then becomes determined to achieve Oblivion's goal of non-existence on a universal scale. Maelstrom assumes the powers of the entity Anomaly, becoming the embodiment of the abstract principle of anomaly. This brings Maelstrom into conflict with the agent of the entity Eon, the cosmic hero Quasar, in the Outer Void (realm of Oblivion). After several battles, Quasar finally defeats Maelstrom when caught off-guard and the power of Quasar's quantum bands consumes him.[6] Maelstrom is later revived by his minions, but learns he had a son, Ransak, that would have been wiped from existence had he succeeded. Ashamed, he shrinks himself out of sight.[7]/nEventually, Maelstrom returns, attempting to destroy the universe by creating a device known as the Cosmic Crunch. He battles the Great Lakes Avengers, who are powerless to stop him. In order to be prepared, he hires Batroc the Leaper and his brigade to help him. During the final battle, Maelstrom is tricked into killing himself by Mr. Immortal after he tells him that the grand secret of the universe was eternal loneliness. His soul is later collected by Doorman, who was recently chosen by Oblivion as its new angel of death, replacing Deathurge, who was captured by Mr. Immortal.[8]/nMaelstrom was later encountered by Drax the Destroyer and Quasar when they were killed and sent to the realm of Oblivion. He came into possession of Phyla's Quantum Bands and used them to feed her to the Dragon of the Moon. He was eventually defeated by Drax and Wendell Vaughn and Phyla was able to escape from the Dragon\u2014killing it in the process. However, it turns out that this was simply a ruse for Oblivion to gain a new Avatar of Death\u2014Phyla-Vell.[9]/nMaelstrom can absorb, channel, and otherwise project all forms of kinetic energy for his own purposes, such as strength enhancement, concussive blasts, force field generation, and size shifting.

Meyer (Director of Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture) titled \"The origin of biological information and the higher taxonomic categories\", appeared in the peer-reviewed journal, Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington. Meyer's article was a literature review article, and contained no new primary scholarship itself on the topic of intelligent design. The following month, the publisher of the journal, the Council of the Biological Society of Washington, released a statement repudiating the article and stating that their former editor Richard M. Sternberg had, in an unusual manner, handled the entire review process without consultation or review from an associate editor.[2] The position of editor was unpaid and voluntary, and Sternberg had put in his resignation from it six months earlier.[3] Sternberg disputes the Council's statement and asserts that the paper was appropriately peer reviewed by three biologists who \"concluded that [the paper] warranted publication\".[4]/nThe same statement from the Council vowed that proper review procedures would be followed in the future and endorsed a resolution published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which states that there is no credible scientific evidence supporting intelligent design.[5] On September 18, the Discovery Institute issued a statement praising the publication of Meyer's paper in a peer-reviewed journal and chastising the National Center for Science Education for stating that the paper should not have been published.[6]  The Biological Society of Washington's president, Roy McDiarmid called Sternberg's decision to publish Meyer's article \"a really bad judgment call on the editor's part\" and said it was doubtful whether the three scientists who peer reviewed the article and recommended it for publication were evolutionary biologists.[7]/nThe event has been used to support an unsubstantiated but common narrative of persecution.[8][9]/nRichard M. Sternberg is an American evolutionary biologist who has completed a BS degree from University of South Carolina and has two PhDs; the first from 1995 in molecular evolution from Florida International University, and a second in systems science from Binghamton University. He did post-doctoral work between 1999 and 2001 at the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) at the Smithsonian Institution,[10] on the phylogeny of crabs.[11]/nIn February 2001 he began work as an invertebrate taxonomist for the National Institutes of Health at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, later becoming a staff scientist. The position allowed time for research work, and he continued at the NMNH, now as an unpaid research associate. Soon after starting work, he agreed to take on the unpaid position of Managing Editor of the peer-reviewed scientific journal, Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington,[3][11] a taxonomic journal which usually publishes descriptions of newly identified species. Also in 2001, he joined the editorial board of the Baraminology Study Group, a young earth creationist \"creation science\" attempt to identify and classify the created kinds mentioned in scripture.[12] He has stated that he is an outside critic and remained skeptical of their young earth beliefs.[13] Around this time he was sympathetic to historic ideas of structuralism of patterns in nature, but could not go from that to inferring the existence of a designer. He occasionally met proponents of intelligent design, and in 2002 presented a lecture on formal causation to the ISCID intelligent design group's \"Research And Progress in Intelligent Design\" (RAPID) conference.[11][14]/nIn October 2003 Sternberg resigned from being editor of the Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington, with a commitment to edit issues over the coming year. Early in 2004 intelligent design advocate Stephen C. Meyer contacted Sternberg about a manuscript that he was thinking of submitting to the journal. Sternberg advised him he would have to become a member of the Society, and in a few weeks Meyer sent him copies of the manuscript with evidence of membership. Sternberg went ahead with the review and editing process,[3][11] and Meyer's article appeared in the journal on 4 August 2004. This was already scheduled to be the second last issue that Sternberg would edit.[3] In a statement issued by 10 October 2004 the journal declared that Sternberg had published the paper at his own discretion without following the usual practice of review by an associate editor. The Council and associate editors would have considered the subject of the paper inappropriate for publication as it was significantly outside \"the nearly purely systematic content\" of the journal.[2] The Council endorsed a resolution \"which observes that there is no credible scientific evidence supporting ID as a testable hypothesis\", and that the paper therefore \"does not meet the scientific standards of the Proceedings\".[2]/nSternberg continued in his job as a staff scientist at the National Center for Biotechnology Information until 2007, and continued to hold the unpaid position of Research Associate at the NMNH, which was extended on 15 November 2006 by a further three year appointment as an unpaid 'research collaborator' at the NMNH. After 2007 Sternberg became a research scientist at the intelligent design Biologic Institute, supported by a research fellowship from the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture, of which Stephen Meyer is a co-founder and currently director.[10][15]/nSternberg is a Roman Catholic \"who attends Mass.\"[16] He subscribes to the process structuralism school of thought.[17] In 2005 he said he was not a proponent of intelligent design.[12] He has more recently described his position as one that \"can accept all that is empirically valid in evolutionary biology, while not axiomatically dismissing the position that structures as well as their \"real\" instantiations have an intelligent cause\", and asserts that the universe emanates from Nous (mind), so that his thinking \"is compatible with intelligent design broadly defined.\"[10]\nSternberg serves as a fellow of the International Society for Complexity, Information and Design (ISCID), an intelligent design group.[18] He is also a signatory to the Discovery Institute's Scientific Dissent from Darwinism petition.[19]/nSternberg insists the paper was properly peer reviewed, and rejects the reason given by the journal for disavowing the article, saying:/nAs managing editor it was my prerogative to choose the editor who would work directly on the paper, and as I was best qualified among the editors I chose myself.[4]/nA series of articles in Skeptic criticized the decision to publish the article.  Michael Shermer disputed Sternberg's qualifications as a peer reviewer, stating that it dealt less with the areas Sternberg was qualified to review (systematics and taxonomy) than it did paleontology, for which many members of the society would have been better qualified to peer review the paper; at that time the Society had three members who were experts on Cambrian invertebrates, the subject discussed in Meyer's paper.[20]  A follow-up article by Ed Brayton criticized Sternberg's decision to review the paper, given his ties to a known movement that opposes the theory of evolution:[21]/nSternberg argues that he had the authority to publish Meyer's paper. But having that authority does not excuse the professional and ethical misjudgments. If you know that the publication of a pro-ID paper in a Smithsonian journal is going to cause an outcry, and you have close ties to the ID movement and to the author of this paper specifically, the ethical thing to do would be to excuse yourself from handling that paper and allow someone without those personal and professional ties to the author and subject of the paper to decide whether it should be published. Thus, Sternberg's decision to publish the paper without the normal peer-review process is a flagrant breach of professional ethics that brought disrepute to the Smithsonian./nDoubts were raised whether the reviewers were evolutionary biologists.[7] According to an article by the Society of Academic Authors Meyer said the article grew out of a presentation he made at a conference attended by Richard Sternberg where they discussed the possibility of a paper for society's journal.[7] Observers have pointed to affiliations that in most circumstances would have disqualified Sternberg from reviewing an article on intelligent design.[22]  They note that Sternberg is a Fellow of the International Society for Complexity, Information and Design, a Discovery Institute-affiliated group dedicated to promoting intelligent design. Sternberg is also a signatory of the Discovery Institute's  A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism statement \"We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged.\"[23]/nSternberg claims to have also checked with a Council member and to have followed the standard practice for peer review:/nThree reviewers responded and were willing to review the paper; all are experts in relevant aspects of evolutionary and molecular biology and hold full-time faculty positions in major research institutions, one at an Ivy League university, another at a major North American public university, a third on a well-known overseas research faculty. There was substantial feedback from reviewers to the author, resulting in significant changes to the paper. The reviewers did not necessarily agree with Dr. Meyer's arguments or his conclusion but all found the paper meritorious and concluded that it warranted publication...four well-qualified biologists with five PhDs in relevant disciplines were of the professional opinion that the paper was worthy of publication.[24]/nOf the four \"well-qualified biologists with five PhDs\" Sternberg identifies, one was Sternberg himself, contributing his double doctorate to the total he cited. Sternberg's claim of following proper peer review procedures directly contradicts the published public statement of his former employer, the publisher of the journal, that the proper procedures were not followed resulting in the article's retraction.[2] In previous years the Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington had published yearly lists of all the people who had served as peer reviewers. That list is absent for 2004, the year of the incident. Sternberg has repeatedly refused to identify the three \"well-qualified biologists,\"[25] citing personal concerns over professional repercussions for them./nIn a review of Meyer's article The origin of biological information and the higher taxonomic categories, Alan Gishlick, Nick Matzke, and Wesley R. Elsberry claimed it contained poor scholarship, that it failed to cite and specifically rebut the actual data supporting evolution, and \"constructed a rhetorical edifice out of omission of relevant facts, selective quoting, bad analogies, knocking down straw men, and tendentious interpretations.\"[22] Further examination of the article revealed that it was substantially similar to previously published articles co-authored by Meyer.[26]/nCritics of Sternberg believe that he was biased in the matter, arguing that Sternberg's close personal and ideological connections to the paper's author suggest at least the appearance of conflict of interest.[27] They cite as evidence[28] Sternberg's presentation in 2002 of a lecture on intelligent design at the Research And Progress in Intelligent Design (RAPID)[29] conference where Stephen C. Meyer, the author of the paper Sternberg published, also presented a lecture.[30] The explicit purpose of the RAPID conference was to \"form new collaborations among scientists seeking to do research on the interface between science and faith, particularly within the context of ID\".[31] Only  intelligent design advocates spoke at it, and at least one intelligent design critic was expressly forbidden to attend it.[32] It was organized and hosted by the International Society for Complexity, Information and Design (ISCID), a group dedicated to promoting intelligent design, of which Sternberg is a Fellow.[33] ISCID is affiliated with the Discovery Institute, hub of the intelligent design movement, where Meyer serves as the Program Director of the Center for Science and Culture.[34] Critics also note that Sternberg also sat on the editorial board of the Baraminology Study Group,[27] which studies \"creation biology\" and whose website is hosted by Bryan College, a conservative Christian school named after William Jennings Bryan, who famously opposed Clarence Darrow in the Scopes Trial./nThe American Association for the Advancement of Science, in a position statement describing the events around the controversy, said \"Given these associations, Dr. Sternberg would appear to be, at very least, an advocate for 'intelligent design' and critical of standard peer review processes as they bear on the scientific assessment of the 'intelligent design' hypothesis.\"[35] Critics describe Sternberg's explanation of events, that a pro-intelligent design paper just happened to find its way to a publication with a sympathetic editor ultimately responsible for ensuring proper peer review and editing of his last issue, and that he decided it was appropriate to deal with the review process in person on a subject in which he has a personal interest, as improbable and that \"people who want us to believe that the publication process outlined [by Sternberg and his defenders] was transparent and only had to do with science\" are \"disingenuous.\"[28]/nJournalist Chris Mooney has compared the Sternberg controversy to that of a paper published by climate change deniers Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas in Climate Change, where a sympathetic editor Chris de Freitas allowed it to be published, despite its lack of scientific merit.[36]/nAfter the peer review controversy became public, Sternberg filed a religious discrimination complaint against the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, where he had an unpaid appointment as a research associate,[37][38] while employed by the National Institutes of Health.[39][40]/nSternberg claims that he was \"targeted for retaliation and harassment\" and subject to efforts to remove him from the museum in retaliation for his views in support of intelligent design. He continues to cite a letter by the United States Office of Special Counsel as supporting his version of events, despite the fact that the Office of Special Counsel did not proceed beyond its initial investigation. In its initial investigation, Office of Special Counsel concluded that there was a strategy by several managers to force Sternberg out of the Smithsonian Institution and that there was a strong religious and political component to the actions taken after the publication of the Meyer article. For example, one of the emails sent between Smithsonian employees stated, \"Scientists have been perfectly willing to let these people alone in their churches, but now it looks like these people are coming out and invading our schools, biology classes, museums and now our professional journals. These people to my mind are only a scale up on the fundies of a more destructive kind in other parts of the world. Depressing. Oh, if we only still had Steve Gould to lead the counter-attack\".[41] Pim Van Meurs and other critics observed that the Office of Special Counsel lacked jurisdiction over the matter and so his claim was unlikely to proceed,[42] and that even though it made no official findings or conclusions, the response from the Office of Special Counsel provided Sternberg and the Discovery Institute putative evidence and talking points supporting their claim that the scientific community discriminates against intelligent design proponents.[43][44] In a Wall Street Journal op-ed article, Discovery Institute Senior Fellow David Klinghoffer[45] portrayed Sternberg as a martyr and victim of discrimination,[46] a tactic used often by design proponents.[9]/nIn response, Sternberg's supervisor at the Smithsonian, Jonathan Coddington, responded publicly disputing Sternberg's and Klinghoffer's depiction of events. Coddington states that Sternberg was never dismissed, nor was he a paid employee, and that he was never the target of discrimination, and remained serving at the museum up to that time.[38]/nIn August, 2005 the Office of Special Counsel dropped Sternberg's religious discrimination complaint against the Smithsonian Institution. It was determined that as an unpaid research associate at the Smithsonian, Sternberg was not actually an employee, and thus the Office of Special Counsel had no jurisdiction. Nick Matzke, Jason Rosenhouse and other critics have commented that the Office of Special Counsel itself appears biased in its initial handling of the matter, given the links between the religious right and the Republican Party, with George W. Bush appointee James McVay authoring its opinion.[43][47]/nIn a November 2005 National Public Radio report on the affair, Sternberg stated \"I'm not an evangelical, I'm not a fundamentalist, I'm not a young earth creationist, I'm not a theistic evolutionist\". Sternberg said McVay \"related to me, 'the Smithsonian Institution's reaction to your publishing the Meyer article was far worse than you imagined'.\" Barbara Bradley Hagerty, NPR's religion reporter, said Sternberg himself believes intelligent design is \"fatally flawed.\"[48]/nIn December 2006 a partisan report was issued by Mark Souder,[49][50] on the basis of information he and fellow Republican representative and intelligent design advocate Rick Santorum (author of the pro-ID Santorum Amendment) had requested, calling into question the Smithsonian's treatment of Sternberg and repeating many of Sternberg's claims.[15][51][52] The report was commissioned by Souder in his capacity as subcommittee chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform, written by his subcommittee staff, but published by Souder as an individual representative without it being officially accepted into the Congressional Record.[53] This is contrary to oft-repeated claims by the Discovery Institute and other design proponents that the report represents an official position by the Committee supporting Sternberg's claims of discrimination./nObservers have said that facts of the case simply do not support the conclusions of the report nor is the report an official report of the committee.[54] They say that the Discovery Institute is using the report to portray Sternberg specifically, and design proponents in general, as victims of persecution. They also say the Souder report is a repackaging of the Office of Special Council's previous findings from August 2005 and contains nothing new, consisting of \"the OSC findings restated and used as a form of evidence in and of themselves\" and attacks the Smithsonian for \"not accepting the OSC's findings at face value.\"[8] They cite as evidence of a biased motive behind the report the longstanding connections of the report's instigators, Congressmen Souder and Santorum, to the Discovery Institute, whose Program Director is Stephen C. Meyer, author of the paper Sternberg published.  In 2000 Souder co-hosted a congressional briefing on behalf of the Discovery Institute intended to drum up political support for intelligent design and read a defense of intelligent design prepared by the Discovery Institute into the congressional record.[52] Santorum worked with the Discovery Institute's program director Phillip E. Johnson in 2000 and 2001 drafting the pro-intelligent design Santorum Amendment and in March 2006 wrote the foreword for the book, Darwin's Nemesis: Phillip Johnson And the Intelligent Design Movement a collection of essays largely by Discovery Institute fellows honoring Johnson as \"father\" of the intelligent design movement. Contained in the appendix to the Souder report is a letter from the director of the Smithsonian where it is revealed that Sternberg demanded that they give him a $300,000 grant to make up for his allegedly lost research time; he was turned down.[15] Sternberg's appointment as a Smithsonian Institution research associate was from January 2004 through January 2007.  Research associates are not employees of the Museum and appointments are typically awarded for up to three years./nAs one of the Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns, the Institute conducted extensive lobbying and public relations efforts on Sternberg's behalf, including arranging for articles by Institute Fellows to be published in the mainstream press.[55][56][57][58] The April 2008 film featuring Ben Stein promoting intelligent design, Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed, included interviews with Sternberg and claims that his \"life was ruined\".

Cetacean Sightings Network, a whale sightings report system that relies heavily on Citizen science.[6] The B.C. Cetacean Sightings Network facilitates the reporting of whale sightings through the WhaleReport mobile app. Details on whale locations are then used by the WhaleReport Alert System to notify nearby vessels of cetaceans in their vicinity and to encourage them to take precautionary or evasive action.[7] Data from the B.C. Cetacean Sightings Network is also used to encourage the practice of land-based whale watching. In 2015, the B.C. Cetacean Sightings Network partnered with the Whale Trail, a Seattle-based organization dedicated on identifying potential land-based whale watching sites in the Pacific Northwest. Land-based whale watching is viewed as a zero-impact alternative to traditional boat-based whale watching. As of recent[when?], the WhaleTrail B.C. has identified 39 such sites.[8] In addition, sightings data is available to academic researchers, industry, and NGOs to aid conservation-based research projects. Discoveries involving sightings data include a newly discovered hot spot of Pacific white-sided dolphin in the Howe Sound area in 2010, and the discovery of a feeding ground utilized by Gray whales in Baynes Sound.[9]/nBarrett-Lennard has made significant research contributions relating to the conservation of killer whales. Through DNA analysis, Barrett-Lennard and his colleagues have shown that the killer whale population in the northeastern Pacific ocean is divided into at least nine sympatric sub-populations.[10] His research focuses on evidence of sympatric speciation in killer whale subpopulations inhabiting the northeastern Pacific. His work has shown that killer whale sub-populations vary significantly in their diet,[11] behaviour,[12] and feeding grounds.[13] His work has unveiled wide variability in the diet of killer whale sub-populations. Barrett-Lennard's most cited study showed that the Southern resident killer whale is primarily piscivorous, and 96% of its diet is salmonids.[14] The same study also discovered a distinct preference for mammalian prey by the Southern Transient Killer Whale sub-population.[15] He has also shown that offshore killer whales may prey on Pacific sleeper shark, the first identified observation of the species being targeted as prey.[16] In 2008, Barrett-Lennard's research was used by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife to officially list the Southern Resident Killer Whale as an endangered species[17][18]/nBarrett-Lennard's most recent work focuses on the use of drone-based aerial photogrammetry to remotely observe health and body condition of killer whales.[19] His team has showed that images captured by drones can be used to estimate blubber fat reserves and subsequently body condition by analyzing features such as head shape and eyepatch proportions.[20] Barrett-Lennard has also used drones to remotely monitor the respiratory microbiome of killer whales by aerially capturing samples of exhaled breath or \"blow\" [21]/nBarrett-Lennard has been a featured speaker at the annual B.C Marine Mammal Symposium in Vancouver, British Columbia.

She also writes in the popular press examining popular culture and media from a scientific viewpoint.[25][26][27]/nHer first book, The Epigenetics Revolution,[3] describes how epigenetic modifications allow the same DNA to express different characteristics; she likens DNA to a script for a play rather than a template. The same script can produce different productions of the play.[28]/nShe used the example of Audrey Hepburn's slight figure to explain the possible impacts of epigenetics.[28] Hepburn's figure was a result of lifelong illnesses brought on by her deprivation during the Dutch famine of 1944\u201345 during World War II. Carey's book says we aren't simply born with pre-set genes and the way genes function can be altered 'epigenetically' by our environments or diets. These changes can subsequently impact future generations.[28] The book discusses controversies which are a part of this rapidly developing field and explores explanations other than epigenetics for some findings.[29]/nPeter Forbes of The Guardian wrote that while the book does not simplify scientific terminology for the general reader, it \"is the first to set out the epigenetics stall for the general reader, and anyone seriously interested in who we are and how we function should read this book\".[30] Other reviewers also found the book \"a bit jargon heavy\",[31]  while some felt this was \"not so much her fault as the nature of biology\".[32] Alexander Badyaev writes that \"you cannot help but admire the author who is so fluent in such a great diversity of topics\".[33]/nCarey's second book, Junk DNA: A Journey Through the Dark Matter of the Genome,[4] examines developments in the study of junk DNA, or noncoding DNA. DNA that doesn't code for proteins has been dismissed as nonfunctional until recently. She explains the \"most fundamental reason for the shift in emphasis is the sheer volume of junk DNA that our cells contain. One of the biggest shocks when the human genome sequence was completed in 2001 was the discovery that over 98 per cent of the DNA in a human is junk. It doesn't code for any proteins.\"[4]:\u200a2\u200a Carey describes how this Junk DNA/nmaintains the integrity of our chromosomes; regulates the ways the protein-coding genes are expressed; influences how we age and generally introduces incredible degrees of subtlety and flexibility into how we use the relatively small numbers of genes that code for proteins\u00a0... [and] contributes to all sorts of situations, from the correct control of gene expression in female cells to the regulation of pathways that drive cancer. From Ernest Hemingway's mutant cat to exoneration of the innocent through DNA fingerprinting, junk DNA impacts on an astonishing range of biological phenomena.[34]/nThe book uses analogy to explain molecular phenomena. Although there is some criticism that the book's coverage is \"too comprehensive for the general reader\" and \"lacks an overarching, compelling narrative to carry readers through\", reviewer Linda Geddes called it \"a cutting-edge, exhaustive guide to the rapidly changing, ever-more mysterious genome.\"[35] It is recommended for \"any nonspecialist who would like a captivating, thorough, and up-to-date introduction...[to] the bigger picture of our wonderful and messy genome.\"[36]/nCarey describes the controversy and politics around this field: \"At one extreme we have scientists claiming experimental proof is lacking to support sometimes sweeping claims. At the other are those who feel there is a whole generation of scientists (if not more) trapped in an outdated model and unable to see or understand the new order.\"[4]:\u200a6\u200a While some reviewers have criticised her style, a few also attack her science.[37]/nEdited by Carey, Epigenetics for Drug Discovery,[5] is \"written by the leading researchers in this field.

Nightingale which defines epigenetics and explains why it matters;[40] a chapter by Tom D. Heightman and Michael McCullar which  focuses \"on the biochemical mechanisms controlling DNA methylation, consequences of aberrant DNA methylation in complex chronic diseases, existing modulators of DNA methylation used in the clinic, and opportunities for new drugs targeting this central epigenetic mechanism\"[41] and a chapter titled \"Progress in Targeting Epigenetic Readers\" by Chun-Wa Chung.[42]/nThis book is part of the Royal Society of Chemistry's Drug Discovery Series[6] which includes over fifty volumes published since 2010 in the fields of drug discovery and medicinal chemistry. \"Providing comprehensive coverage of this important and far-reaching area, the books encourage learning in a range of different topics and provide valuable reference for scientists working outside their own areas of expertise.\"[6]/nThis book discusses a new technique for genetic modification called CRISPR. This system allows the scientists to precisely and easily manipulate the genes of any living organism in a short period of time.

First published in 1755, in conjunction with the imminent Seven Years' War, the map was subsequently used during the Treaty of Paris (1783) to define the boundaries of the newly independent United States and has been resolving border disputes since./nJohn Mitchell was born in 1711 in Lancaster County, Virginia to a relatively well off merchant and planting family. He went to Scotland to study at the University of Edinburgh, earning the M.A. in 1729, then studying medicine until 1731 but without receiving the M.D. He then returned to Virginia to practice medicine; by 1735 he had set up his practice at Urbanna. In his spare time he studied natural history and became known as a botanist. He was elected to the original American Philosophical Society in 1744.[2] In 1745, Mitchell argued that a series of epidemics occurring in Virginia were due to unsanitary troop ships from Britain./nMitchell and his wife, Helen (about whom almost nothing is known, including her maiden name), suffered themselves from ill health. So in 1746, they moved to Britain's milder climate. En route, their ship was captured by a French privateer; although they were released, their belongings (and Mitchell's botanical samples) were confiscated, and they arrived in London with only Mitchell's small fund of investments to their name. Mitchell did not try to compete with the metropolitan doctors; instead, he established himself as an expert on exotic botany. He was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society in November 1748, his candidature citation describing him as \"A Gentleman of great merit and Learning, who Some time Since communicated to the Royal Society a very curious dissertation concerning the Colour of the skin in Negroes, and who from his long residence in Virginea, & from his great application to the Study of Natural history, especially Botany, is very well acquainted with the vegetable productions of North America, being desirous of being admitted a fellow of the Royal Society, is recommended by us from our personal knowledge of him as highly deserving the Honour he desires, as we believe he will be (if chosen) a usefull and valuable member of our Body.\"[3]/nHe continued to live in London, often touring the country estates of his aristocratic friends/patrons, occasionally writing articles and pamphlets, and living the life of a gentleman of modest means.[citation needed] His wife probably died soon after they reached London;[citation needed] Mitchell himself died in 1768.[citation needed]/nMitchell's main claim to historical fame is his large map of the North American colonies that was first published in Philadelphia then in London in 1755 and was reprinted several times during the second half of the 18th century. It is the most comprehensive map of eastern North America made during the colonial era and was used as a primary map source during the Treaty of Paris for defining the boundaries of the newly independent United States.  It remained important for resolving border disputes between the United States and Canada as recently as the 1980s.[4]/nMitchell wrote a paper in 1744 called An Essay upon the Causes of the Different Colours of People in Different Climates, submitted to the Royal Society in London by his correspondent Peter Collinson.  In the paper, Mitchell claimed that the first race on earth had been a brown and reddish colour.  He wrote \"that an intermediate tawny colour found amongst Asiatics and Native Amerindians\" had been the \u201coriginal complexion of mankind\u201d, and that other races came about by the original race spending generations in different climates.[5]", "27237858": "Detlef Weigel (born 1961 in Lower Saxony, Germany) is a German American[2] scientist working at the interface of developmental and evolutionary biology./nWeigel was an undergraduate in biology and chemistry at the universities of Bielefeld and Cologne. In 1986, he graduated with a Diploma in biology for this thesis on Drosophila neurogenesis with the late Jos\u00e9 Campos-Ortega. In 1988, he moved to the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in T\u00fcbingen. During his PhD work with Herbert J\u00e4ckle\u00a0[de],[citation needed] he discovered the founding member of an important class of transcription factors, the Forkhead/FOX proteins.[3][4] In 1988, he graduated with a PhD (summa cum laude) from the University of T\u00fcbingen./nWeigel began to work with plants during his postdoctoral research with Elliot M. Meyerowitz at Caltech, where he cloned the floral regulator LEAFY from Arabidopsis thaliana.[5] From 1993 to 2002, he was an Assistant and then Associate Professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla. In 2002, he accepted an appointment as Scientific Member and Director at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, where he founded the Department for Molecular Biology. He is also an adjunct professor at the Salk Institute and the University of T\u00fcbingen. In 2012, Weigel co-founded the plant bioinformatics startup company Computomics in T\u00fcbingen.\nHe is a deputy editor of the eLife.[6] He also served on the Life Sciences jury for the Infosys Prize in 2013./nDuring the 1990s, Weigel mostly studied the development of individual flowers and how the onset of flowering is regulated. His group made important discoveries in both areas. Together with Ove Nilsson, he demonstrated that transfer of the LEAFY gene from Arabidopsis thaliana to aspen trees was sufficient to reduce the time to flowering from years to months.[7] Weigel and his team isolated the FT gene,[8] which was later found to be an important component of the mobile signal inducing flowering.[9] New genetic tools developed by his group led to the discovery of the first microRNA mutant in plants.[10]/nThrough his study of factors that control the onset of flowering, a quintessential adaptive trait, Weigel became interested in more general questions of evolution. Apart from work on genetic variation in environment-dependent developmental processes, his group is known for the generation of extensive genomic resources, such as the first haplotype map for a non-mammalian species.[11][12] To further exploit and advance the understanding of genetic variation, Weigel and colleagues initiated the 1001 Genomes project for Arabidopsis thaliana. Related to this is a new area of interest, in genetic barriers. In collaboration with Jeffery Dangl, his group discovered that such barriers in plants are often associated with autoimmunity. They could show that in certain hybrid offspring, specific gene products contributed by one of the parents may be inappropriately recognized as foreign and pathogenic, and thus trigger pervasive cell death throughout the plant.[13] Most of the causal genes encode components of the immune system, indicating that there are constraints on the assembly of an optimal immune system.[14] Several cases have been examined in detail and shown to be due to direct protein-protein interactions.[15][16]", "67444197": "Nina Antonivna Karavanska[a] (n\u00e9e Strokata[b]; 31 January 1926 \u2013 2 August 1998) was a Ukrainian dissident, Soviet microbiologist and immunologist. She was a member of the dissident movement in the USSR, a co-founder of the Ukrainian Helsinki Group and one of the leading human rights activists in Odesa during the Soviet period. She is the author of about 23 scientific papers in the field of clinical microbiology and immunology. She spoke Russian, Ukrainian, English, German, Polish, and Romanian. She was the wife of Sviatoslav Karavansky./nNina Antonivna Strokata was born on 31 January 1926[1] (according to other sources in 1925) in the Ukrainian city of Odesa, which was then part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic within the Soviet Union. After graduating from high school, she entered the Odesa Medical Institute (now - Odesa National Medical University), which she graduated in 1947. In the following years, Strokata worked as a specialist in various Ukrainian cities (including from 1951 to 1952 at the Odesa Medical Institute).[2]/nAfter graduating from the institute, she worked as a junior researcher, an assistant at the Department of Epidemiology, and then an assistant at the Department of Microbiology of the institute. According to the distribution, Nina Strokata was sent to the local district hospital for two years in Tatarbunary Raion, and later as the head of the medical department./nIn 1961, Strokata met one of the activists of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, Sviatoslav Karavansky, who at that time had just returned to his homeland after 16 years in prison. He arrived in Odesa after the amnesty. They later married. A year later she returned to Odesa, continued to work at the medical institute. In 1963, she was accepted as a junior researcher at the Central Research Laboratory at the university, where she worked until 1971. At that time she had prepared her PhD thesis. Karavansky resumed his studies at the evening department of the philological faculty of Odesa State University (now the I. I. Mechnikov Odesa State University), and also joined the opposition struggle. He prepared and distributed samizdat in Odesa, and promoted the Ukrainian language. In November 1965, Sviatoslav Yosypovych was arrested for the second time and two days later he was sent without trial to serve a 25-year term.[3][citation needed] Since then, Nina Karavanska was fighting against the illegal arrests and convictions of her husband, despite the fact that the management of the institute demanded that she give up her husband.[1]/nAfter her husband was detained, the KGB tried to persuade Nina to denounce Sviatoslav for his actions, but the latter remained with him and did not leave her husband.[3] In December 1966, Nina Karavanska appealed to the head of the camp where her husband was staying, as well as to Leonid Brezhnev, General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, and to the French communist newspaper L'Humanit\u00e9. The petition stated:/n\"For 18 years, the camp administration has been unable to influence prisoner S.I. Karavansky, and his family is not allowed to maintain contact with him. Therefore, I, the wife of S.I. Karavansky, ask for him to be shot in order to end my husband's many years of suffering and the endless conflicts between Karavansky and the administration.\"[1]/nDespite this request, in April 1970, Sviatoslav Karavansky was sentenced in prison to an additional term of 5 years in prison and 3 years in exile. Attempts to defend the man in court led to the judge issuing a separate decision, which he sent to the Odesa Medical Institute, \"to take measures of public influence against Nina Antonovna Strokata in order to instill in her a sense of high patriotic duty as a citizen of the USSR.\"[c] The result of this decision was the persecution of Strokata, condemnation of her behavior in the team and in the administration. Prolonged harassment at work ended with her dismissal in May 1971.[3] As Strokata could not get a job in Odesa, she went to the city of Nalchik, where she was hired as a teacher at a medical school. In the autumn of the same year, she exchanged her apartment in Odesa for housing in Nalchik, and on 5 December, she settled there with the family of Yuri-Bohdan Shukhevych.[1]/nAt that time, a doctor, Oleksiy Prytyk, was arrested in Odesa. He admitted that Strokata had brought samizdat from Kyiv and Lviv, and he and Oleksiy Riznikov had distributed it. All three were charged with anti-Soviet agitation, distributing and reading samizdat, and raising funds to help political prisoners.[3] As a result, on 6 December 1971, Strokata was arrested. She was accused of distributing the Ukrainian Herald, samizdat, and writing a letter in defense of Yuli Daniel. In connection with this arrest, Ihor Kalynets and Viacheslav Chornovil set up a Public Committee in Lviv to protect Strokata, which included Vasyl Stus, Leonid Tymchuk, Pyotr Yakir and others. It was the first open human rights organization in Ukraine. But in early 1972, almost all the members of the committee were imprisoned. They managed to publish only two documents - a statement on the establishment of the committee and a bulletin \"Who is N.A. Strokata (Karavanska)?\" In addition, the American Society of Microbiologists, among others, defended Strokata, and elected her a member.[1]/nOn 19 May 1972,[3] Karavanska was sentenced under Part 1 of Article 62 of the Criminal Code of the Ukrainian SSR to four years in a maximum security camp on charges of \"conducting anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda.\" The woman was serving her sentence in the women's department of the ZhKh-385/3 camp, located in the village of Barashevo, Tengushevsky District, Mordovia.[1] Even during her nine-month stay in the KGB prison, Karavanska's health deteriorated, and her condition in the camp deteriorated significantly. In captivity, she participated in the hunger strikes of women political prisoners. In particular, Daria Husyak, Nadiya Svitlychna, Iryna Senyk, Iryna Kalynets, Stefania Shabatura, etc. were in the camp with her.[3] Strokata spent the last days of her term in the oncology hospital.[1] At the end of 1975, she was released from a concentration camp with a ban on returning to Ukraine.[3] In response, Strokata renounced Soviet citizenship./nAfter her release, Karavanska settled in Tarusa, Kaluga Oblast, where she was monitored by security forces for a year. Life in the north affected the health of Strokata. So in October of the following year, 1976, she became seriously ill and was taken to a local regional hospital, where she was discharged at her request in November. This decision was due to the desire to go for treatment in the capital's hospital with more experienced staff. Karavanska went to one of these hospitals without asking permission from the police on 20 November and lay there until 4 January of the following year. On 17 January, the court fined the woman 20\u00a0Rbls for this violation, and on 3 February, she was again placed under supervision for another six months. In the following years, this term was extended several more times./nAs early as 1976, Karavanska became one of the founding members of the Ukrainian Helsinki Group, which was founded by Soviet dissidents to promote the Helsinki Accords. She took an active part in this movement, in particular, all documents and appeals of the group were created with the participation of Karavanska and signed. In addition, she also maintained contact with the Moscow Helsinki Group.[1]/nOnly then, that is 10 years after the arrest of Sviatoslav Karavansky, was Nina allowed a one-day meeting with her husband. After he was released in 1979, the couple tried to get permission to return to Ukraine, but failed. Fearing another imprisonment of Sviatoslav, who had spent 31 years in concentration camps by that time, the Karavanskys left for Vienna on 30 November of that year. On 11 December, they arrived in the United States, where they settled in Denton, Texas./nThere Karavanska spoke, wrote articles, told the Ukrainian diaspora and other Americans the truth about the national liberation movement in Ukraine, organized moral and material support for Soviet prisoners and their families, and conducted public work.[3] There she became a member of the Foreign Representation of the Ukrainian Helsinki Group.[1] In 1980 she published the book \"Ukrainian Women in the Soviet Union: Documented Persecution,\" and in 1981 - \"A Family Torn Apart.\"[2] On 2 August 1998, Nina Antonivna Karavanska-Strokata died in Denton.[3]/nStrokata published two books about her public work:/nOn 8 November 2006, President Viktor Yushchenko posthumously awarded Strokata the Order for Courage of the First Degree \"for civil courage, devotion in the struggle for the establishment of the ideals of freedom and democracy, and on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Ukrainian Public Group to promote the implementation of the Helsinki Accords.\"[4]", "23535083": "Anwar Nasim (born 7 December 1935)[1] is a Pakistani molecular biologist and geneticist who was the president of Pakistan Academy of Sciences from 2015\u20132017.

Astroviruses have an icosahedral shape made of 20 identical equilateral triangular sides and are plus-sense, meaning the genetic information can be directly translated into proteins. Human astroviruses have a genome with approximately 7,000 bases. This genome encodes three important proteins: nonstructural proteins 1a and 1ab and the viral capsid protein (CP). The Tao Lab has determined the structure of the capsid protein core and surface spike. The lab also discovered that the capsid protein has a similar structure in astroviruses and the hepatitis E virus. The Tao Lab is currently investigating structural changes to the capsid protein that allows for the virus to infect a host cell even when treated with protease, which is used to slow the progression of other RNA virus infections.[12]/nThe Tao Lab is working to better understand the Orsay virus life cycle. Caenorhabditis elegans is a model organism in biology research. Orsay virus is the only type of virus known to infect C. elegans worms. Orsay infection in C. elegans is chronic and not lethal. Since C. elegans are frequently handled in the lab and can remain infected with Orsay virus for a long time, they are a convenient way to study Orsay virus. The positive sense, single-stranded Orsay genome encodes an RNA polymerase, a viral capsid protein (CP) and a nonstructural protein delta. Previous Tao Lab research has discovered that bound CP-delta proteins form a fiber that is part of the infectious virion. The CP-delta head fiber is involved in receptor binding and host entry, helping the virus infect its host cell. The delta protein on its own is involved in nonlytic viral egress.[12][13]/nInfluenza viruses, also called the \u201cflu\u201d and known for the annual vaccine, are a serious public health concern. There are four types of influenza viruses: A, B, C, and D. Influenza D Virus (IDV) was first isolated in 2011. IDV infects cattle, pigs, and other ruminants. The Tao Lab aims to understand how the IDV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) compares to the Influenza A Virus nonstructural protein 1. The lab also hopes to uncover the mechanism that creates IDV matrix proteins M1 and M2. Understanding the structure and function of NS1 and M1 proteins will help the lab understand IDV replication and pathogenesis.[12]", "43949577": "Armin Dale Kaiser (November 10, 1927 \u2013 June 5, 2020)[1] was an American biochemist, molecular geneticist, molecular biologist and developmental biologist.[2]/nKaiser received in 1950 his bachelor's degree from Purdue University and in 1955 his PhD from Caltech in biology.

He was the director of the Central Institute of Microbiology and Experimental Therapy in Jena from 1953 to 1976, a member of the Academy of Sciences of the German Democratic Republic (i.e. of East Germany), and professor of bacteriology at the University of Jena.[2] He was awarded the National Prize of the GDR in 1949 and 1952.[1] In the late 1960s he got involved in an effort to save the historic center of Jena, protesting against the \"socialist\" urban development plans.[3]/nIn 1931 he started studying medicine at the University of Frankfurt on Main. A year later he joined the Nazi Party and the Sturmabteilung (SA). He quit the latter in 1935 (after the Night of the Long Knives).[4] Little else is known about his political involvement during this period because his name does not appear in the 200,000-page records recovered from the Nazi Party Chancellery.[5] He gained the Dr. med. degree in 1938. During his studies he was also an assistant at the Institute of Colloid Research at Frankfurt under Raphael Eduard Liesegang.[2] In 1937 Kn\u00f6ll started cooperating with Jenaer Glaswerk Schott and Gen. which developed all-glass bacterial filters. He developed an accurate measuring procedure for checking the filters. In return the company offered him the opportunity to establish and manage its bacterial lab\u2014a full-time job Kn\u00f6ll began in November 1938. At the glass works he established a still existing collection of defined strains of different microorganisms as basis for filter checking.[6]/nThe Schott glass works were associated with Carl Zeiss AG. This led Kn\u00f6ll to cooperate with the Zeiss factory in the development of phase contrast and fluorescent microscopy.[6] In 1944 he participated in the isolation of nucleosides in living bacteria using phase contrast microscopy.[2] In the same year this successful cooperation led to the transformation of the four-employee lab into the Institute of Microbiology, also known as the Schott-Zeiss-Institute because it was financially supported by the two firms.[6]/nDuring World War II, Kn\u00f6ll's attention was also drawn to penicillin. In 1942 his institute delivered penicillin on laboratory scale. Nazi Germany did not manage to achieve industrial scale production of penicillin before the war ended. After end of the war, Jena fell into the Soviet occupation zone, and the Soviet military administration ordered an immediate expansion in penicillin production.[6] As a result of the rapid increase in the size of the operation, the fermentation section of the Institute of Microbiology became known as Jenapharm in 1947. In 1950 the Institute of Microbiology officially became an independent nationally owned factory, the VEB Jenapharm, and Kn\u00f6ll was appointed its director. The company's portfolio quickly grew to include streptomycin, vitamins, analgesics, and transfusion solutions. Its workforce expanded to hundreds of employees by the end of the 1940s.[6]/nIn 1949 Kn\u00f6ll obtained his Habilitation degree,[1] and a year later he became professor of bacteriology at the University of Jena, but he also continued to lead Jenapharm. There Kn\u00f6ll initiated BCG production, which was used for the tuberculosis vaccination regime in the GDR.[2] The scope of this operation was large enough that a separate building was erected on Jena's Beutenberg Hill in 1952.[6]/nA year later Kn\u00f6ll left Jenapharm to become the director of the newly founded Institute of Microbiology and Experimental Therapy (IMET) built on the same Beutenber Hill, according to his directions. In 1956 the institute became part of the East German Academy of Sciences, and its name changed to Central Institute of Microbiology and Experimental Therapy (ZIMET).[6] With this occasion Kn\u00f6ll became a member of the Academy.[3] In the twenty years that Kn\u00f6ll led ZIMET, the institute became one of the largest in the GDR with over 1000 employees, and engaged in research and development in antibiotics, biotechnology, experimental therapy, medical and environ microbiology, microbial genetics, and steroids.[6] At ZIMET Kn\u00f6ll continued to work on problems concerning the miniaturization and automation of microbiological methods. He developed a system of apparatuses for the selection of antibiotic producing microorganisms, and the evaluation of antibiotic activity. He is credited with a complete description of the life cycle of Sarcina maxima in 1973.[2]/nImmediately after World War II ended, following Soviet leadership, reconstruction in Jena had emphasized preserving the historically developed structure of East German cities, as well as regional building styles. This policy changed in the 1960s when the central government put emphasis on new and modern buildings. In Jena this change was materialized by an urban plan centered around building a massive skyscraper, the Jen-Tower, within the intimate urban core of the city in 1968\u20131969. The skyscraper was meant to be a research facility for the VEB Zeiss, and also to symbolize architecturally the victory of socialism in Germany. Walter Ulbricht, the Socialist Unity Party leader, personally pushed for these developments in early 1968 during a visit to Jena. To accommodate this massive structure, VEB Zeiss would raze much of the old inner city. The activists that fought against the tower's construction nicknamed it \"penis jenensis\" taking advantage of its tall cylindrical shape.[3]/nCollegium Jenense was a thirteenth-century Dominican cloister that was the principal site of the University of Jena from its founding until the mid-nineteenth century. Both Goethe and Alexander von Humboldt had lectured within its walls. The Collegium was not located exactly on the building site of the Zeiss skyscraper, but it was meant to be demolished to make room for an adjacent recreational center that was intended to be connected to the tower. In 1969 Kn\u00f6ll dedicated himself to saving this site.[3] Taking advantage of his fame he pressured the architect Hermann Henselmann, the city's mayor, the university's rector, Zeiss' general director and other local authorities. He also enlisted several colleagues in this effort, including the physicist Max Steenbeck who also served as technical adviser to Walter Ulbricht. The authorities tried to choke off his efforts by deprecating them. They accused Kn\u00f6ll of \u201cdeviously\u201d misinforming his fellow citizens about the collegium's fate, and questioned his Institute's overall loyalty to the regime.[3]/nTaking advantage of the economic difficulties that VEB Zeiss faced at the time, Kn\u00f6ll demanded immediate assurances that the Collegium would not be demolished until the firm actually had the money to build the recreation center. This was an effective tactic and two years later the state officially conceded that the recreational center would not be built and that the collegium would be spared. The height and breadth of the tower was also reduced. Nevertheless, when it was completed in 1971 it had 27 stories. After its completion the tower became a white elephant, and VEB Zeiss sought to escape the cost of maintaining it. The Council of Ministers shifted ownership of the building to the University of Jena, despite its protestations.[3]/nZIMET was officially closed in 1991 by a decision of Academy of Sciences of the GDR, and its divisions were spun into five separate institutes in 1992. One of these successors, the Hans Kn\u00f6ll Institute for Natural Products Research (HKI), was named after him.[6] The institute was admitted in the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community in 2003.[7]", "17112634": "Ralf Baumeister (born September 1, 1961 in Schwabach) is a German professor (Bioinformatics and Molecular Genetics)./nHe is currently co-director of the School of Life Sciences at Freiburg University's Institute of Advanced Studies.\nHe uses the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans in his studies./n/nThis article about a German biologist is a stub.

Originally trained in biochemistry and physiology,[1] Diamond is commonly referred to as a polymath, stemming from his knowledge in many fields including anthropology, ecology, geography, and evolutionary biology.[2][3] He is a professor of geography at UCLA.[4]/nIn 2005, Diamond was ranked ninth on a poll by Prospect and Foreign Policy of the world's top 100 public intellectuals.[5]/nDiamond was born on September 10, 1937, in Boston, Massachusetts. Both of his parents were  Ashkenazi Jewish. His father, Louis Diamond, was a physician who emigrated from Chi\u0219in\u0103u in present-day Moldova, then known as Bessarabia. His mother, Flora n\u00e9e\u00a0Kaplan, was a teacher, linguist, and concert pianist.[6] Diamond began studying piano at age six; years later, he would propose to his wife after playing Brahms' Intermezzo in A major for her.[7]/nBy the age of seven he developed an interest in birdwatching.[1] This became one of his major life passions and resulted in a number of works published in ornithology.[8]/nHe attended the Roxbury Latin School and studied biochemical sciences at Harvard College, graduating in 1958. He obtained his PhD from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1961, with a thesis on the physiology and biophysics of membranes in the gallbladder.[4][9][10]/nAfter graduation from Cambridge, Diamond returned to Harvard as a Junior Fellow until 1965, and, in 1968, became a professor of physiology at UCLA Medical School. While in his twenties he developed a second, parallel, career in ornithology and ecology, specialising in New Guinea and nearby islands, which he began visiting from 1964.[1] Later, in his fifties, Diamond developed a third career in environmental history and became a professor of geography at UCLA, his current[update] position.[10] He also teaches at LUISS Guido Carli in Rome.[11] He is a lecturer on the biodiversity management course at the European Institute of Innovation for Sustainability (EIIS) in Rome.[12] He won the National Medal of Science in 1999.[13]/nDiamond originally specialized in salt absorption in the gall bladder.[9][14] He has also published scholarly works in the fields of ecology and ornithology,[15][16] but is arguably best known for authoring a number of popular-science books combining topics from diverse fields other than those he has formally studied. Because of this academic diversity, Diamond has been described as a polymath.[17][18]/nDiamond has written multiple popular science articles and books, notably The Third Chimpanzee (1991); Guns, Germs, and Steel (1997, awarded a Pulitzer Prize); Collapse (2005), The World Until Yesterday (2012), and Upheaval (2019). For a list, see Jared Diamond bibliography \u00a7\u00a0Books./nDiamond's first popular book, The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal (1991), examines human evolution and its relevance to the modern world, incorporating evidence from anthropology, evolutionary biology, genetics, ecology, and linguistics. The book traces how humans evolved to be so different from other animals, despite sharing over 98% of our DNA with our closest animal relatives, the chimpanzees. The book also examines the animal origins of language, art, agriculture, smoking and drug use, and other apparently uniquely human attributes. It was well received by critics and won the 1992 Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc Prize for Science Books[19] and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize.[20]/nHis second and best known popular science book, Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, was published in 1997. It asks why Eurasian peoples conquered or displaced Native Americans, Australians, and Africans, instead of vice versa. It argues that this outcome was not due to genetic advantages of Eurasian peoples themselves but instead to features of the Eurasian continent, in particular, its high diversity of wild plant and animal species suitable for domestication and its east/west major axis that favored the spread of those domesticates, people, technologies\u2014and diseases\u2014for long distances with little change in latitude./nThe first part of the book focuses on reasons why only a few species of wild plants and animals proved suitable for domestication. The second part discusses how local food production based on those domesticates led to the development of dense and stratified human populations, writing, centralized political organization, and epidemic infectious diseases. The third part compares the development of food production and of human societies among different continents and world regions. Guns, Germs, and Steel became an international best-seller, was translated into 33 languages, and received several awards, including a Pulitzer Prize, an Aventis Prize for Science Books[19] and the 1997 Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science.[21] A television documentary series based on the book was produced by the National Geographic Society in 2005.[22][23]/nIn his third book, Why is Sex Fun?, also published in 1997, Diamond discusses evolutionary factors underlying features of human sexuality that are generally taken for granted but that are highly unusual among our animal relatives. Those features include a long-term pair relationship (marriage), coexistence of economically cooperating pairs within a shared communal territory, provision of parental care by fathers as well as by mothers, having sex in private rather than in public, concealed ovulation, female sexual receptivity encompassing most of the menstrual cycle (including days of infertility), female menopause, and distinctive secondary sexual characteristics.[24]/nDiamond's next book, Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, published in 2005, examines a range of past societies in an attempt to identify why they either collapsed or continued to thrive and considers what contemporary societies can learn from these historical examples. As in Guns, Germs, and Steel, he argues against explanations for the failure of past societies based primarily on cultural factors, instead focusing on ecology. Among the societies mentioned in the book are the Norse and Inuit of Greenland, the Maya, the Anasazi, the indigenous people of Rapa Nui (Easter Island), Japan, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and modern Montana./nThe book concludes by asking why some societies make disastrous decisions, how big businesses affect the environment, what our principal environmental problems are today, and what individuals can do about those problems. Like Guns, Germs, and Steel, Collapse was translated into dozens of languages, became an international best-seller, and was the basis of a television documentary produced by the National Geographic Society.[25] Collapse was also nominated for the Royal Society Prize for Science Books.[19] When it was nominated, Diamond was the only author to have won the award twice previously,[26] though he did not win a third time./nFifteen archaeologists, cultural anthropologists, and historians from the American Anthropological Association criticized Diamond's methods and conclusions, working together with the larger association to publish the book Questioning Collapse as a counter to Diamond's claims.[27] In response, Diamond, as an editor at the time for the journal Nature, published an official review in the journal negatively covering the book,[28] without mentioning that the book was a critique of his own work. The authors and the publisher, Cambridge University Press, called out Diamond for his conflict of interest on the subject.[29][30]/nIn 2008, Diamond published an article in The New Yorker entitled \"Vengeance Is Ours\",[31] describing the role of revenge in tribal warfare in Papua New Guinea. A year later, two indigenous people mentioned in the article filed a lawsuit against Diamond and The New Yorker, claiming the article defamed them.[32][33][34] In 2013, The Observer reported that the lawsuit \"was withdrawn by mutual consent after the sudden death of their lawyer.\"[6]/nIn 2010, Diamond co-edited (with James Robinson) Natural Experiments of History, a collection of seven case studies illustrating the multidisciplinary and comparative approach to the study of history that he advocates. The book's title stems from the fact that it is not possible to study history by the preferred methods of the laboratory sciences, i.e., by controlled experiments comparing replicated human societies as if they were test tubes of bacteria. Instead, one must look at natural experiments in which human societies that are similar in many respects have been historically perturbed. The book's afterword classifies natural experiments, discusses the practical difficulties of studying them, and offers suggestions on how to address those difficulties.[35]/nIn The World Until Yesterday, published in 2012, Diamond asks what the western world can learn from traditional societies. It surveys 39 traditional small-scale societies of farmers and hunter-gatherers with respect to how they deal with universal human problems. The problems discussed include dividing space, resolving disputes, bringing up children, treatment of elders, dealing with dangers, formulating religions, learning multiple languages, and remaining healthy. The book suggests that some practices of traditional societies could be usefully adopted in the modern industrial world today, either by individuals or else by society as a whole.[citation needed]/nIn  Upheaval: How Nations Cope with Crisis and Change Diamond examines whether nations can find lessons during crises in a way like people do. The nations considered are Finland, Japan, Chile, Indonesia, Germany, Australia, and the U.S.[36] Diamond identifies four modern threats: nuclear weapons, climate change, limited resources, and extreme inequality.[37]/nAnand Giridharadas, reviewing for The New York Times, claimed the book contained many factual inaccuracies.[38] Daniel Immerwahr, reviewing for The New Republic, reports that Diamond has \"jettisoned statistical analysis\" and the associated rigour, even by the standards of his earlier books, which have themselves sometimes been challenged on this basis.[39]/nDiamond is married to Marie Cohen, granddaughter of Polish politician Edward Werner.

Beginning in the late 1990s Zuker and Ryba identified and characterized the receptors and the cells mediating each of the five basic taste modalities: sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami. They then demonstrated that individual taste receptor cells are tuned to encode individual taste qualities, and are hardwired to trigger innate behaviors (like attraction to sweet and aversion to bitters)./nIn 2003, Zuker and Ryba were the first to use targeted expression of a novel receptor (RASSL) to activate a neural circuit in a behaving mouse, and profoundly changed its behavior:  By expressing RASSL in sweet or bitter taste receptor cells they could drive the animal to be attracted, or averse, to the otherwise tasteless RASSL ligand./nIn a set of milestone studies exploring the peripheral and central coding of taste, and combining molecular genetics, physiology, imaging, animal behavior, and optical control of neural circuits, Zuker and collaborators identified the circuits driving responses to the different taste stimuli, and showed that by manipulating the neurons representing sweet and bitter taste in the brain they could directly control an animal\u2019s internal representation, sensory perception, and behavioral actions./nZuker\u2019s laboratory has also helped uncover the fundamental difference between liking sweet (i.e. the role of the taste system, activated by both sugars and artificial sweeteners) and wanting sugar (i.e. the strong desire for sugar). They showed that, in addition to the tongue, sugar acts in the gut to activate a novel neural circuit that communicates to the brain the presence of sugar. This gut-to-brain communication axis (also-known-as the gut-brain axis) is not activated by artificial sweeteners and functions as the principal conduit driving preference for sugar./nPrior to working on mammalian taste, his lab focused on signal transduction pathways in Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), including vision, mechanotransduction and thermosensation./n2001 Elected Member, American Academy of Arts and Sciences/n2004 Elected Member, National Academy of Sciences/n2006 Elected member, National Academy of Medicine/n2014 Elected Fellow, American Association for the Advancement of Science", "47128177": "Gurcharan Singh Kalkat (17 June 1926 \u2013 27 January 2018)[1] was an Indian agricultural scientist and the founder chairman of the Punjab State Farmers Commission (PSFC), known for his contributions in bringing the green revolution to Punjab.[2] The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest Indian civilian honour of Padma Shri in 1981[3] and followed it up with the third highest Indian civilian award of Padma Bhushan in 2007.[4]/nGurcharan Singh was born on 17 June 1926 in the Indian state of Punjab.[5][dead link] He graduated in agriculture from Punjab Agricultural College, Lyallpur in 1947 and secured a master's degree in agriculture from the University of Punjab in 1956.

Fairbank, then an assistant professor of physics at Amherst, to pursue biophysics at Yale.[11]/nIn 1953, he completed a PhD in biophysics at Yale University, where his doctoral research focused on the inactivation of viruses by heat and ionizing radiation.[12][13] He studied medicine at the University of Rochester for two years, quitting two days into a pediatrics rotation.[13] Then he became a postdoctoral researcher in biophysics at Yale University investigating bacterial spores.[14] From 1960 to 1963, he worked as a biophysicist at the General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady, New York.[12][15] In 1964, Woese joined the microbiology faculty of the University of Illinois Urbana\u2013Champaign, where he focused on Archaea, genomics, and molecular evolution as his areas of expertise.[10][12][15] He became a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana\u2013Champaign's Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology, which was renamed in his honor in 2015, after his death.[15]/nWoese died on December 30, 2012, following complications from pancreatic cancer, leaving as survivors his wife Gabriella and a son and daughter.[16][17][18]/nWoese turned his attention to the genetic code while setting up his lab at General Electric's Knolls Laboratory in the fall of 1960.[13] Interest among physicists and molecular biologists had begun to coalesce around deciphering the correspondence between the twenty amino acids and the four letter alphabet of nucleic acid bases in the decade following James D. Watson, Francis Crick, and Rosalind Franklin's discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953.[19] Woese published a series of papers on the topic. In one, he deduced a correspondence table between what was then known as \"soluble RNA\" and DNA based upon their respective base pair ratios.[20] He then re-evaluated experimental data associated with the hypothesis that viruses used one base, rather than a triplet, to encode each amino acid, and suggested 18 codons, correctly predicting one for proline.[13][21] Other work established the mechanistic basis of protein translation, but in Woese's view, largely overlooked the genetic code's evolutionary origins as an afterthought.[19]/nIn 1962, Woese spent several months as a visiting researcher at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, a locus of intense activity on the molecular biology of gene expression and gene regulation.[13] While in Paris, he met Sol Spiegelman, who invited Woese to visit the University of Illinois after hearing his research goals; at this visit Spiegelman offered Woese a position with immediate tenure beginning in the fall of 1964.[13] With the freedom to patiently pursue more speculative threads of inquiry outside the mainstream of biological research, Woese began to consider the genetic code in evolutionary terms, asking how the codon assignments and their translation into an amino acid sequence might have evolved.[13][22]/nFor much of the 20th century, prokaryotes were regarded as a single group of organisms and classified based on their biochemistry, morphology and metabolism. In a highly influential 1962 paper, Roger Stanier and C. B. van Niel first established the division of cellular organization into prokaryotes and eukaryotes, defining prokaryotes as those organisms lacking a cell nucleus.[23][24] Adapted from \u00c9douard Chatton's generalization, Stanier and Van Niel's concept was quickly accepted as the most important distinction among organisms; yet they were nevertheless skeptical of microbiologists' attempts to construct a natural phylogenetic classification of bacteria.[25] However, it became generally assumed that all life shared a common prokaryotic (implied by the Greek root \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc (pro-), before, in front of) ancestor.[24][26]/nIn 1977, Carl Woese and George E. Fox experimentally disproved this universally held hypothesis about the basic structure of the tree of life.[27] Woese and Fox discovered a kind of microbial life which they called the \u201carchaebacteria\u201d (Archaea).[5] They reported that the archaebacteria comprised \"a third kingdom\" of life as distinct from bacteria as plants and animals.[5] Having defined Archaea as a new \"urkingdom\" (later domain) which were neither bacteria nor eukaryotes, Woese redrew the taxonomic tree. His three-domain system, based on phylogenetic relationships rather than obvious morphological similarities, divided life into 23 main divisions, incorporated within three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eucarya.[3]/nAcceptance of the validity of Woese's phylogenetically valid classification was a slow process. Prominent biologists including Salvador Luria and Ernst Mayr objected to his division of the prokaryotes.[28][29] Not all criticism of him was restricted to the scientific level. A decade of labor-intensive oligonucleotide cataloging left him with a reputation as \"a crank,\" and Woese would go on to be dubbed as \"Microbiology's Scarred Revolutionary\" by a news article printed in the journal Science.[6] The growing body of supporting data led the scientific community to accept the Archaea by the mid-1980s.[13] Today, few scientists cling to the idea of a unified Prokarya./nWoese's work on Archaea is also significant in its implications for the search for life on other planets. Before the discovery by Woese and Fox, scientists thought that Archaea were extreme organisms that evolved from the microorganisms more familiar to us. Now, most believe they are ancient, and may have robust evolutionary connections to the first organisms on Earth.[30] Organisms similar to those archaea that exist in extreme environments may have developed on other planets, some of which harbor conditions conducive to extremophile life.[31]/nNotably, Woese's elucidation of the tree of life shows the overwhelming diversity of microbial lineages: single-celled organisms represent the vast majority of the biosphere's genetic, metabolic, and ecologic niche diversity.[32] As microbes are crucial for many biogeochemical cycles and to the continued function of the biosphere, Woese's efforts to clarify the evolution and diversity of microbes provided an invaluable service to ecologists and conservationists. It was a major contribution to the theory of evolution and to our knowledge of the history of life.[19]/nWoese wrote, \"My evolutionary concerns center on the bacteria and the archaea, whose evolutions cover most of the planet's 4.5-billion-year history. Using ribosomal RNA sequence as an evolutionary measure, my laboratory has reconstructed the phylogeny of both groups, and thereby provided a phylogenetically valid system of classification for prokaryotes. The discovery of the archaea was in fact a product of these studies\".[12]/nWoese also speculated about an era of rapid evolution in which considerable horizontal gene transfer occurred between organisms.[27][33] First described by Woese and Fox in a 1977 paper and explored further with microbiologist Jane Gibson in a 1980 paper, these organisms, or progenotes, were imagined as protocells with very low complexity due to their error-prone translation apparatus (\"noisy genetic transmission channel\"), which produced high mutation rates that limited the specificity of cellular interaction and the size of the genome.[34][35] This early translation apparatus would have produced a group of structurally similar, functionally equivalent proteins, rather than a single protein.[27] Furthermore, because of this reduced specificity, all cellular components were susceptible to horizontal gene transfer, and rapid evolution occurred at the level of the ecosystem.[33][36]/nThe transition to modern cells (the \"Darwinian Threshold\") occurred when organisms evolved translation mechanisms with modern levels of fidelity: improved performance allowed cellular organization to reach a level of complexity and connectedness that made genes from other organisms much less able to displace an individual's own genes.[33]/nIn later years, Woese's work concentrated on genomic analysis to elucidate the significance of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) for evolution.[37] He worked on detailed analyses of the phylogenies of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and on the effect of horizontal gene transfer on the distribution of those key enzymes among organisms.[38] The goal of the research was to explain how the primary cell types (the archaeal, eubacterial, and eukaryotic) evolved from an ancestral state in the RNA world.[12]/nWoese shared his thoughts on the past, present, and future of biology in Current Biology:[11]/nThe \"important questions\" that 21st century biology faces all stem from a single question, the nature and generation of biological organization. . . . Yes, Darwin is back, but in the company of . . . scientists who can see much further into the depths of biology than was possible heretofore. It is no longer a \"10,000 species of birds\" view of evolution\u2014evolution seen as a procession of forms. The concern is now with the process of evolution itself.[11]/nI see the question of biological organization taking two prominent directions today. The first is the evolution of (proteinaceous) cellular organization, which includes sub-questions such as the evolution of the translation apparatus and the genetic code, and the origin and nature of the hierarchies of control that fine-tune and precisely interrelate the panoply of cellular processes that constitute cells. It also includes the question of the number of different basic cell types that exist on earth today: did all modern cells come from a single ancestral cellular organization?[11]/nThe second major direction involves the nature of the global ecosystem. . . . Bacteria are the major organisms on this planet\u2014in numbers, in total mass, in importance to the global balances. Thus, it is microbial ecology that . . . is most in need of development, both in terms of facts needed to understand it, and in terms of the framework in which to interpret them.[11]/nWoese considered biology to have an \"all-important\" role in society. In his view, biology should serve a broader purpose than the pursuit of \"an engineered environment\":[11]/nWhat was formally recognized in physics needs now to be recognized in biology: science serves a dual function. On the one hand it is society's servant, attacking the applied problems posed by society. On the other hand, it functions as society's teacher, helping the latter to understand its world and itself. It is the latter function that is effectively missing today.[11]/nWoese was a MacArthur Fellow in 1984, was made a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1988, received the Leeuwenhoek Medal (microbiology's highest honor) in 1992, the Selman A. Waksman Award in Microbiology in 1995 from the National Academy of Sciences,[39] and was a National Medal of Science recipient in 2000. In 2003, he received the Crafoord Prize from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences \"for his discovery of a third domain of life\".[40][41]  He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2004.[42] In 2006, he was made a foreign member of the Royal Society.[10]/nMany microbial species, such as Pyrococcus woesei,[43] Methanobrevibacter woesei,[44] and Conexibacter woesei,[45] are named in his honor./nMicrobiologist Justin Sonnenburg of Stanford University said \"The 1977 paper is one of the most influential in microbiology and arguably, all of biology. It ranks with the works of Watson and Crick and Darwin, providing an evolutionary framework for the incredible diversity of the microbial world\".[19]/nWith regard to Woese's work on horizontal gene transfer as a primary evolutionary process, Professor Norman R. Pace of the University of Colorado at Boulder said, \"I think Woese has done more for biology writ large than any biologist in history, including Darwin... There's a lot more to learn, and he's been interpreting the emerging story brilliantly\".[46]", "9936538": "Dame Julia Margaret Polak, DBE, FMedSci (26 June 1939 \u2013 11 August 2014)[1] was an Argentine-born Polish pathologist who lived in England.

Daisy subsequently manifested superpowers inherited from Zabo's mutated genetic code.[32]/nThe Hood hired him as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.[33]/nLater, he was seen with Cobra (who was now operating as King Cobra), Firebrand and the Mauler, who attacked Yellowjacket, the Constrictor and other Initiative staff and trainees.[34]/nHyde worked with Boomerang, Tiger Shark, and Whirlwind to manipulate Venom III into procuring Norman Osborn's fortunes. This was thwarted by Venom and Green Goblin as Osborn threw a bomb into Hyde's mouth, causing him to spit out blood. Osborn then warned Hyde and the other villains that if they ever cross him again, he will kill everyone that they ever loved before they are tortured to death.[35]/nHyde joins the Grim Reaper's new Lethal Legion, claiming embarrassment over Norman Osborn blowing a bomb up in his mouth.[36]/nHyde appears as a member of the Hood's crime syndicate during an attack on the New Avengers.[37]/nHyde was selected to be a part of the \"beta team\" of the Thunderbolts, alongside Boomerang, the Shocker, Gunna and Centurius.[38]/nLater, Hyde began a drug operation in California where he came into conflict with Robbie Reyes after his car had some of Hyde's pills inside. Hyde's mercenaries chase Robbie down during the race in order to retrieve the car and the pills. Robbie is gunned down by the mercenaries when he mistakes them for police and they torch the scene. Robbie is revived as a demonic being called the Ghost Rider who sports a flaming helmet-like head. In this form, Robbie drives off in the car, now similarly ablaze. The Ghost Rider defeats a few mercenaries and soon disappears in an explosion.[39] Robbie eventually fights and defeats Zabo, becoming something of a local hero and urban legend.[40] Having regrouped and refined his Hyde formula into new blue pills, Calvin Zabo gradually takes over the L.A. criminal underground with his \"Blue Hyde Brigade\", which includes Guero and his gang, longtime enemies of Robbie, calling themselves the \"Blue Kr\u00fce.\"[41]/nDuring the \"Avengers: Standoff!\" storyline, Hyde was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D.[42] Mister Hyde was knocked out by Warwolf.[43]/nDuring the \"Opening Salvo\" part of the Secret Empire storyline, Hyde is recruited by Baron Helmut Zemo to join the Army of Evil.[44] During HYDRA's takeover of the United States, Hyde is one of a few Army of Evil members not in a stasis pod and is shown leading a group of HYDRA soldiers to invade New Attilan and capture the Inhumans.[45] He, alongside HYDRA's Avengers, catch his daughter Daisy and her team, the Secret Warriors. During interrogation, Daisy uses her powers to destroy the Helicarrier they are in, forcing Hyde to retreat.[46]/nThe process that transforms Calvin Zabo into his Mister Hyde persona are growth hormones caused by ingestion of a chemical formula.[47] As his body adjusted to its new form, Hyde's strength, stamina, durability, and healing were all boosted to uncommon levels. Hyde's powers are so sufficient that he can stand up and face Joe Fixit in a fight.[48] He was shown tearing apart an armored car door with ease.[49] Through further experimental procedures over the years, his abilities have been increased beyond their original limits. Zabo must consume his special serum periodically for him to remain as one identity from another. However, mental stress or pain could impair this transformation into Hyde. He employs a wristwatch-like device supplied with the formula that injects itself directly into his bloodstream, thus enabling to transform himself by button pushing.[50]/nDue to the nature of these transformations, Hyde's skin is warped. This gives his face a distorted look reminiscent of Lon Chaney, Sr.'s make-up used in The Phantom of the Opera./nZabo is also an intelligent research scientist with a Ph.D. in medicine and biochemistry. When assuming his Hyde form, he loses those skills./nMarc Buxton of Den of Geek ranked Mister Hyde 15th in their \"Marvel\u2019s 31 Best Monsters\" list and called him a \"monstrous force worthy of his classic monster namesake.\"[51]/nIn the timeline of the Age of Apocalypse storyline, Mister Hyde (as well as the Cobra) is a near-feral and cannibal \"scavenger\". He is known to prowl graveyards and attack anyone entering his territory.[52]/nMister Hyde appeared in the Elseworlds crossover comic book Daredevil/Batman: Eye for an Eye. Two-Face partnered with Hyde for a series of technological robberies. In truth, Two-Face had implanted Hyde's brain with the material needed to \"grow\" an experimental \"organic\" computer chip and fed Hyde pills to keep him enraged. Once grown, the chip would kill Hyde, its current growth also weakening Hyde's strength as his energy is diverted to support the chip (Batman noting during the fight that Hyde should normally have a punch that could knock Superman into orbit). Hyde berates Two-Face, proud he has abandoned his past as Zabo and insults Two-Face for hanging onto his Harvey Dent side, as well as using a coin to decide between right and wrong. Two-Face is glad the process will kill Hyde. In the end, Daredevil uses his past friendship with Dent to talk Two-Face into supplying the antidote for the chip, which saves Hyde's life.[53]/nMister Hyde appears as a member of the Hood's Masters of Evil.[54] Before the Red Guard attacks Santo Rico, Hyde leaves the team alongside the Cobra, Crossbones, and Thunderball.[55] Hyde was later seen as an Army scientist.[56]/nA zombified Mister Hyde appears in Marvel Zombies 4. He is seen attacking the new Midnight Sons, trying to bite one of them, but he is quickly killed by the Man-Thing when he rips the zombie Hyde apart and then, holding a huge boulder, drops it down on him, crushing the zombie Hyde to death instantly.[57]/nMister Hyde is the antagonist of the first two issues of this alternate universe retelling of Thor's origin. Thor, confused and partially amnesiac, stops Hyde from hassling an innocent woman.

John Theodore Archibald Reed, rector of Leckhampstead, and Anna Maria Dayrell. We know little about Anna's childhood or education. Her father, a rector, probably encouraged an interest in science as part of her home schooling. There were plenty of books around the home, since Anna's father collected Bibles printed in various languages. Her sisters Henrietta (1807\u201360) and Frances (1810\u201372) stimulated an interest in botany and art, although Anna's diaries indicate that at first she was intrigued by geology.[1]/nIn 1831, at 26, she married Rev. Dr Thomas John Hussey, rector of Hayes, Kent, who was a well-connected astronomer and scientist in his own right. They had six children, one of whom was also given the name Anna Maria Hussey. Only two survived to adulthood.[2]/nHussey was a strong willed woman who approached her personal researches with an enthusiasm that she did not quite feel for her role as a clergyman's wife. She resisted when she was called upon by \"every old woman in the parish\" and she chafed at her husband's reminders of her duties.[3]/nDuring her most creative period, she maintained an active and candid correspondence with her mycological mentor, Reverend M. J. Berkley, which provides many details of her daily life and work. In his lifetime, Berkeley described over 6,000 new species of fungi. He assisted Hussey with identifications and she supplied him with specimens. She was also acquainted with Charles Badham, a scholar of classical literature, and mycologist M. C. Cooke, who cites Hussey in his 1875 Fungi: Their Nature and Uses and called her \"friend\".[3]/nIn the 1840s, she contributed writings (possibly including a romantic serial) to The Surplice, a magazine edited by her husband. She also wrote at least one less romantic story, called 'Matrimony', for Frazer's Magazine \u2013 but all these pieces were anonymous, following the conventions of the time.[4]/nAnna Maria Hussey had an interest in natural history and knew Charles Darwin at nearby Down House. One of her brothers, George Varenne Reed, became tutor to Darwin's sons.[4] Hussey (together with her younger sister, Frances Reed) developed an expertise in fungi, corresponding with and sending specimens to the leading mycologist of the day, Rev. Miles Joseph Berkeley.[5]\nHussey's approach to mycology came from the artistic end, rather than from the scientific fields of systematics, field work, or microscopy.[6] She and her sister made watercolour paintings of some of the species they encountered and in 1847 a number of Hussey's illustrations were published as plates in A treatise on the esculent funguses of England by Charles David Badham. These went uncredited, however, as noted by a contemporary reviewer.[7]/nAt the same time, she produced (as Mrs T. J. Hussey) the first volume of an ambitious and expensive work entitled Illustrations of British Mycology, containing 90 colour plates of species collected and illustrated by herself or by her sister, together with descriptions, personal observations, anecdotes, and comments. Illustrations of British mycology is not simply a taxonomic litany of fungi. It is instead a catalog of Anna's experiences with, and knowledge of, fungi. She hoped that her work would inspire future mushroom enthusiasts, especially young people. To that end, she provided instructions on hunting and caring for specimens caught in the countryside.

This is possible thanks to the presence in the soil of perchlorates, a highly hygroscopic kind of chlorine salts which seem to be ubiquitous over the Martian surface. These salts have the capability of catching water vapour from the environment up to the point of becoming solved in it forming concentrated solutions or brines. It is an extreme case of hygroscopy known as deliquescence./nThe eutectic temperature of these brines allows its permanence in liquid state under the registered Martian environmental conditions in the study area of Curiosity, close to the equator, where they are the least favourable for this to happen. Therefore, it is expected that the phenomenon is more intense in terms of duration of the liquid phase in higher latitudes./nThe presence of liquid water on present day Mars entails transcendent consequences in a number of aspects of the planet's exploration. Firstly, it casts a new light on the comprehension of Martian environment, and can be the key to understand some morphological features of the surface, such as the so-called Recurrent Slope Lineae (RSLs). In addition, the discovery has posed the necessity for taking special precautions to avoid biological contamination of the planet with terrestrial organisms carried on board the spacecraft to be sent in the next missions, since the availability of liquid water multiply the possibilities for them to survive and thrive in certain places.

He studied medicine at St George's Hospital, London, graduating as a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (the standard combined medical degree at the University of London at that time) in 1908. He then joined the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and became a Doctor of Medicine in 1913 with a dissertation on the tsetse fly (Glossina palpalis) and sleeping sickness./nIn 1919 he married Amy Frances Thomas-Peter from Cornwall. The marriage had no issue./nIn 1910 he joined the Colonial Medical Service, where he worked in Uganda on the north shore of Lake Victoria. Upon the outbreak of World War I, Carpenter was called to service in the British Army Medical Corps. He was stationed with the troops at the border between Uganda and German East Africa. In December 1914 he was appointed Medical Officer at the fort in Kakindu, southern Uganda. As it turned out, he had plenty of spare time, and spent it studying the local butterflies. \"The hosts of butterflies at Kakindu passed beyond anything I had ever see; some days are quite unforgettable\".[2]/nFrom May 1916 to January 1918, he worked in Tanganyika (former German E. Africa), 200 miles south to south-east of Lake Victoria. Here he conducted experiments on palatability with young insectivorous monkeys. He tested the edibility of cryptic and aposematic insects. This was propitious, because later, back at Oxford, both he and E.B. Poulton worked on the role of predators in shaping mimicry. The standard theory was that cryptic forms were palatable, and aposematic forms were distasteful, implying that palatable mimics of distasteful forms could gain protection from predation. The question at stake was whether the observations, which dated from work by naturalists in the 19th century, could be accounted for by natural selection./nIn England the geneticist R.C. Punnett, and in America the ornithologist W.L. McAtee, doubted both that birds could distinguish distasteful forms, and that their predation was heavy enough to bring about the colour forms found in butterflies. Punnett's 1915 Mimicry in butterflies rejected selection as the main cause of mimicry. He noted:/nFor Punnett, none of these observations were explained by gradual selectionism. Instead he thought mimicry had arisen from sudden mutational jumps (saltations). Once a mimic was formed by mutation, natural selection might play a conservative role./nHowever, one by one, each of these objections were shown to be without substance. Evidence from field observations and experiments showed that birds were often the agents of selection in insects.[3][4][5] Evidence that small-scale mutations were common arrived as soon as breeding experiments were designed to detect them: it was a consequence of experimental methods that early mutations were so noteworthy. Explanations for polymorphism were advanced by E.B. Ford and Dobzhansky and colleagues, who developed experimental methods for populations in the wild.[6][7] The question of polymorphism is discussed further in polymorphism (biology)./nThe gradual coming-together of field observations and experimental genetics is part of the evolutionary synthesis which took place in the middle of the twentieth century.[8] The small 1933 book on mimicry by Carpenter and E.B.

In 2006 he was appointed Senior Lecturer at Harvard Medical School.[6][7][8]/nAt Boston Children's Hospital in 1968 Anderson began vaccine research to prevent Hib disease along with David H. Smith and Richard Insel.  Because animal tests of their first vaccine - a purified polysaccharide - were inconclusive, Anderson and his colleagues tested the vaccines on themselves, finding a useful antibody response.[9]  Clinical trials in Finland demonstrated the vaccine's effectiveness in children, but not in infants.  This vaccine was approved for use in 1986./nAfter moving to the University of Rochester they developed a polysaccharide conjugate vaccine that worked in infants, too.  This vaccine \u2013 and alternative versions thereafter developed - became a part of standard childhood immunization regimens in 1990 and has been credited with reducing Hib disease by 99%.[10][11]/nThe conjugate vaccine technique Anderson and his colleagues developed led to a Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) vaccine that was introduced in developed countries 2000.

She did chores around the house to help her fund a trip to Space Camp in seventh grade. The camp inspired her to take more math and science classes in school. Rubin became the third Space Camp alumni to fly in space.[7] Her father, Jim, still resides in Napa and her mother, Ann Hallisey, lives in Davis, California.[8]/nKathleen Rubins graduated from Vintage High School in Napa, California, in 1996. She received a Bachelor of Science degree in molecular biology from the University of California, San Diego, and a Ph.D. degree in cancer biology from Stanford University Medical School Biochemistry Department and Microbiology and Immunology Department. She was a member of the Kappa Lambda chapter of the Chi Omega sorority while attending UC San Diego./nFor as long as she can remember, Rubins had always wanted to be an astronaut. Her initial understanding was that she would have to become a fighter pilot first and progress from there, but after getting involved with public health HIV prevention in high school she developed an interest in viruses and microbiology and decided to pursue that first instead. Some of her hobbies include flying airplanes and jumping out of them, scuba diving, and entering triathlons, in which she was a member of the Stanford triathlon team.[9]/nRubins conducted her undergraduate research on HIV-1 integration in the Infectious Diseases Laboratory at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. She analyzed the mechanism of HIV integration, including several studies of HIV-1 Integrase inhibitors and genome-wide analyses of HIV integration patterns into host genomic DNA. She obtained her Ph.D. from Stanford University and, with the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Rubins (who was responsible for building its underlying microarray) and colleagues developed the first model of smallpox infection. She also developed a complete map of the poxvirus transcriptome and studied virus-host interactions using both in-vitro and animal model systems./nRubins accepted a Fellow/Principal Investigator position at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research (MIT/Cambridge, Massachusetts) and headed a lab of researchers studying viral diseases that primarily affect Central and West Africa. Work in the Rubins Lab focused on poxviruses and host-pathogen interaction as well as viral mechanisms for regulating host cell mRNA transcription, translation and decay.[10] In addition, she conducted research on transcriptome and genome sequencing of Ebolavirus, Marburgvirus, and Lassa mammarenavirus, and collaborative projects with the U.S. Army to develop therapies for Ebola and Lassa./nDr. Rubins also conducted research regarding space radiation and its effects on astronauts.[11] The authors of this study investigated whether or not the Risk of Exposure-Induced Death (REID) that NASA had accepted was accurate enough. Much of the radiation in space is from ion exposure and solar cycle activity. The authors of the Nature paper concluded that although there are limitations in estimating the radiation levels that astronauts are exposed to while in space, more research needs to be done on the subject./nAnother study that Dr. Rubins was involved with was the life-cycle analysis of a family of viruses including the smallpox virus.[12] The researchers utilized fluorescent protein-based reporters to monitor and analyze the function of the Vaccinia virus. This study was important in starting to work on treatment for diseases like mpox. The mpox is a zoonotic disease originating from the rainforest around Central and West Africa.[13] One can contract mpox when coming in contact with the virus from an animal, human, or any material that has been infected with the virus.[14] In 2003, there was a small mpox outbreak in the United States, which provided more motivation for the study to be conducted.[15] The results of this study provided useful information for the tracking of viral activity and replication. As of January\u00a02023[update], there is still no cure for mpox, but it can be controlled.[13]/nRubins was a part of the research team that investigated the effects of microgravity on RNA isolation and PCR analysis. The experiments occurred between April 19 and May 3, 2017. Operations required the use of the WetLab-2 hardware suite consisting of microgravity-compatible STT (ACT2 or Finger Loop syringe), SPM, bubble-removing Pipette Loader (PL), reaction tube centrifugation rotor and a Cepheid SmartCycler\u00ae for thermocycling/fluorescence readout.[16] This study was conducted while on board the International Space Station (ISS). The experiment performed was one of the first successful ones in the WetLab-2, a research station built for microbiology in space. The results of this study were incredibly valuable for the future of space exploration and analysis of space environment samples./nRubins was selected in July 2009 as one of 14 members of NASA Astronaut Group 20.

Rubins and the other astronauts were conducting research on how to diagnose an illness, or identify microbes growing in the International Space Station and determine whether or not they represent a health threat.[24] San Diego graduate, Kate Rubins, used a commercially available machine to sequence mouse, virus and bacteria DNA.[25] Aboard the ISS, she used a hand-held, USB-powered DNA sequencer called the MinION made by Oxford Nanopore Technologies to determine the DNA sequences of mouse, E. coli bacteria, and lambda phage virus.[26][27] It was a part of the Biomolecule Sequencer experiment, the goal of which was \"to provide evidence that DNA sequencing in space is possible, which holds the potential to enable the identification of microorganisms, monitor changes in microbes and humans in response to spaceflight, and possibly aid in the detection of DNA-based life elsewhere in the universe.\"[28]/nDuring her first stay in space, she also spent 12 hours and 46 minutes outside the station on two separate spacewalks.[29] She made these two spacewalks with veteran spacewalker Jeffrey Williams.[30] During her first spacewalk, Dr. Rubins successfully installed the first International Docking Adapter, which allows U.S. commercial spacecraft to dock.[31] On her second spacewalk, Rubins installed new, high definition cameras. Rubins also captured the SpaceX Dragon commercial resupply spacecraft and sent back experiment samples to Earth./nRubins returned to Earth on October 30, 2016, after 115 days in space.[32]/nRubins launched on her second mission on October 14, 2020 (her 42nd birthday) with Russian cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Sergey Kud-Sverchkov aboard Soyuz MS-17.[33] She returned to Earth on April 17, 2021, at 10:55 AM local (Kazakhstan) time, following the launch of Soyuz MS-18./nRubins was on the ISS at the time of the 2020 United States elections and cast her absentee ballot from the station.[34]/nDuring her second stay in space, she made her third career spacewalk with Victor J. Glover, and her fourth with Soichi Noguchi in March 2021.[35]/nWhile on the ISS during her most recent trip, Rubins continued research for the Cardinal Heart experiment which included cancer therapies and heart conditions. Microgravity significantly affects heart tissues that perform work and exert an opposite force to gravity and is known to cause molecular and structural abnormalities in cells and tissues that can lead to disease. The investigation could provide new understanding of similar heart issues on Earth and help identify new treatments.[36] This study was analyzing the effects of low-gravity on heart muscles. Dr. Rubins and other scientists generated 3D engineered heart tissue. This research could provide important information for heart problems not only for astronauts returning home, but also for any citizen on Earth./nNASA has announced the next group of astronauts to be a part of the Artemis program that will put the first American woman on the Moon.[37] Dr. Rubins is among the astronauts announced on the Artemis Team.[38] The Artemis program aims to not only place an American woman on the Moon but also survey the entire surface of the Moon to gain a better understanding for the possibility of human life on Mars./nRubins has a total of 5 honors and awards so far in her career.

Kluyver famously expressed the idea with the aphorism: \"From elephant to butyric acid bacterium \u2013 it is all the same\".[6] The paper, and other work from Kluyver's lab, helped support both the concept of biochemical unity as well as the idea of \"comparative biochemistry\", which Kluyver envisioned as biochemically equivalent to comparative anatomy. The concept established a theoretical basis for studying chemical processes in bacteria and extrapolating those processes to higher organisms.[7]/nThe concepts of \"biochemical unity\" and \"comparative biochemistry\" were both very influential and probably Kluyver's most significant work. Kluyver's best known student, C. B. van Niel, commented on his mentor's scientific influence and noted that by the middle of the 20th century, his work on biochemical unity was no longer cited. His aphorism was sufficiently widespread that in 1961 Fran\u00e7ois Jacob and Jacques Monod paraphrased it, without mentioning Kluyver, as \"that old axiom 'what is true for bacteria is also true for elephants'\" to justify the genetic code's universality.[8] His career was profoundly influenced[clarification needed] by World War II and the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands./nKluyver is associated with the Delft school of microbiology where he was the successor to Martinus Beijerinck.[4] In 1926 he became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[9] He is considered the father of comparative microbiology.

It focused on the work of one of Lindner's employees, Ziedler, and how he purified a pure form of the yeast by using acidified beer wort. Lindner described S. pombe as \"thoroughly peculiar\" and called it a \"fission yeast\" due to its lack of asexual reproduction through budding. Lindner's report also included a drawing of their observations with a microscope.[4] The text of the original article was later translated from German into English by translator Ted Crump.[6]/nIn 1907, Lindner discovered Endomyces fibuliger, a filamentous and ascopore-forming yeast that he observed to generate septate hyphae (hyphae that possess a septa that divides their cells) with many branches in addition to undergoing budding.[7] He died on 4 January 1945,[8] in Donaueschingen.[1]", "72982385": "Alan Friedlander is an American marine ecologist and fisheries scientist focusing on protecting ocean habitats and incorporating traditional indigenous knowledge into contemporary conservation management.[1] Friedlander was the lead author of the first study to describe inverted biomass pyramids in un-fished coral reef ecosystems.[2] He has authored or contributed to over 400 publications, book chapters, and articles that have been cited over 15,000 times.[3] As chief scientist for National Geographic's Pristine Seas Project, Friedlander has led over 40 expeditions resulting in the creation of 26 new marine reserves protecting more than 6.5 million square kilometers of remote and exceptional ocean habitats.[4]/nAlan Marc Friedlander was born in Baltimore, Maryland, in November 1958.[5] Friedlander received his B.S. in Biology from Roanoke College in 1980.[6] After serving two years in the Peace Corps in Tonga[6][7] working with local fishing communities, he went on to receive an M.S. in Oceanography from Old Dominion University in 1987.[8] Following that, he worked in the US Virgin Islands, first as a fisheries biologist with the territorial government and then as a marine biologist with the Virgin Islands National Park.[9][10] He then went on to obtain a Ph.D. in Zoology (Marine Biology) from the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa in 1996.[7][8] He then conducted post-doctoral research with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Pacific Grove, California.[8][11][12]/nOver the past 40 years,[8] Friedlander has spent more than 12,000 hours underwater \u2013 from coral reefs to the poles and to depths of thousands of meters \u2013 researching to better understand the functioning of marine ecosystems.[13] While in Tonga, he learned the value of a healthy ocean to indigenous communities, sparking his interest in traditional ecological knowledge and its importance in contemporary marine resource management.

At that time this was considered to be improbable and the paper was rejected by several American journals before eventually being published in Europe.[1] Years later it was discovered that the required factor was vitamin B12, or cyanocobalamin. He developed a nutritional assay method for vitamin B12 using Euglena that was used for many years in hospitals to test for B12 levels in blood, eventually being replaced by other methods[2]/nAfter graduating from Cornell, he joined an independent research laboratory, the Haskins Laboratories founded by the physicist Franklin Cooper and the entomologist and geneticist Caryl Haskins. Initially this was based in Massachusetts, near M.I.T., but then it moved to a building on East 43rd Street in New York City, where Hutner was joined by a newly arrived Italian scientist, Luigi Provasoli, who had spent time in the laboratory of Andre Lwoff in Paris. In New York, during the 1940s through the 1960s, Haskins Labs became known for studies of protistan nutrition and the development of culture media and culture assay methods. Hutner was one of the first to appreciate the importance of organic complexing agents in trace metal nutrition of cells . This had significant implications for the development of culture media and also in the understanding of microbial ecology.[3] With his colleague Luigi Provasoli he showed that photosynthetic organisms could be \u2018bleached\u2019 by the antibiotic streptomycin \u2013 an early clue of the endosymbiotic hypothesis about the origin of chloroplasts from a prokaryotic ancestor.[4]/nAt 43rd St., Hutner became known for nurturing young students at a time when this was not a typical pattern, and the lab served as an incubator for many talented high school and undergraduate students.  Some went on to become productive scientists, including the two Nobel laureates, Joshua Lederberg and David Baltimore. While full-time at the lab, Hutner also spent several years on the faculties of Columbia University and Fordham University in this period. He also edited, with Lwoff (and later in a second edition with Michael Levandowsky), a multivolume compendium, the Biochemistry and Physiology of Protozoa, that was for many years a standard reference;[5][6][7][8]/nIn 1970 the lab was required to leave its quarters at 43rd St. Cooper and Provasoli went to Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, but Hutner preferred to remain in New York and moved his part of the lab to Pace University in Lower Manhattan, where he became a professor. Cooper developed the New Haven lab into an institute for the study of speech, language, and reading. It remains today an independently chartered nonprofit organization under the name of Haskins Laboratories, while maintaining close ties with Yale University and University of Connecticut./nIn New York, Hutner's component, focused on microbiological research, has become a department of Pace University and is also named Haskins Laboratories, but the two identically named laboratories no longer have formal ties. At Pace the lab became a center for metabolic studies of protistan parasites, as well as studies of behavioral ecology and sensory physiology of free-living protists.

Telomerase is a two component enzyme (RNA and protein components) that maintains telomere length, which protects the ends of all chromosomes from damage or dysfunction.  Since telomere length tends to shorten with age in humans leading to cellular senescence, telomerase was a potential key factor in promoting human aging from human cancer cells that led to the successful cloning of the first human telomerase gene in early 1994.[19][20]/nFollowing the RNA component of telomerase cloning, Villeponteau worked on Telomerase Therapeutics at Geron. He helped with the cloning effort that eventually identified the protein component of human telomerase in mid-1997. For the successful human RNA telomerase cloning effort, Villeponteau was the senior scientist in the team of four Geron scientists that won the 1997 Distinguished Inventor Award in Washington DC. His subsequent work at Geron provided more evidence that telomeres and telomerase are significant factors in human aging.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27] Geron's academic collaborators Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider later shared the 2009 Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine with Jack Szostak for their early discovery of how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase./nIn 1997 Villeponteau proposed the Heterochromatin Loss Model Of Aging,[22] which proposed that the epigenetics of heterochromatin structure plays an important role in aging.  Heterchromatin is a repressor of gene expression and its loss leads to inappropriate gene expression with senescence.  The model suggests that heterochromatin provides a fundamental epigenetic mechanism that underlies most of the changes in gene expression in senescence. Recent research in Drosophila has supported this heterochromatin loss model[28] and suggest that heterochromatin loss with age may be a unifying theory of aging[29]/nFrom 2002 to 2008, Villeponteau worked for the Reno, NV biotech company Sierra Sciences in several science advisory positions.  Sierra Sciences is a biotech company founded by Bill Andrews that develops drugs for telomerase activation and has filed many telomerase-related patents./nIn 2008 Villeponteau joined Genescient as Vice President of Research.  Genescient (an Irvine biotech spinoff of the University of California/UCI that was cofounded by Gregory Benford) uses advanced genomics and machine learning technologies to develop drugs and nutraceuticals for age-related disease.[30]  At Genescient, Villeponteau worked with UCI professors Michael R. Rose, Larry Mueller, and Anthony Long to understand the genetic difference in long-lived Methuselah flies, which live 3 to 4 times longer than wild-type flies.[31][32]/nGeron Corporation was the first company to develop human embryonic stem cell lines in the mid-1990s. As the Champion of Telomerase Therapeutics at Geron, Villeponteau was interested in the status of telomerase in embryonic stem cells.  As it turns out, embryonic stem cells have very high levels of telomerase.  However, other aspects of embryonic stem cells were not ideal for human therapeutics (e.g. the formation of teratoma cancers), so many scientists and practitioners focused instead on adult stem cells, which do not typically generate tumors. In 2008, Villeponteau formulated a botanical mix that provided telomere support and boosted adult stem cell populations.  Extensive work at Genescient showed definitively that the formulation can double maximum Drosophila life span under specific stress conditions[33]/nIn 2009 Villeponteau cofounded Centagen, which is a biotech company dedicated to developing stem cell technologies that can rejuvenate human adult stem cells from blood, bone marrow, or adipose tissue.  Stem cell numbers and/or function decline with age.  Many stem cell scientists hypothesize that stem cells hold the key to regenerating youthful function./n1. Biotech company Centagen, Inc./n2.

Introduced in 1991, she is the civilian spouse of Starfleet crew member Miles O'Brien (played by Colm Meaney) appearing occasionally in later seasons of the series Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987\u20131994), and more frequently as a supporting character throughout Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993\u20131999), as well as in related media such as novels. The producers wanted her as a regular character on Deep Space Nine, but Chao was only available part-time./nKeiko was introduced as a romantic interest for the recurring Next Generation character of Chief O'Brien, and stories involving her and the couple's children allowed Star Trek to expand its narrative beyond weekly space missions.[1] She is a professional botanist, and becomes a teacher on Deep Space Nine, where her husband has been stationed. She is of Japanese ancestry, which is reflected in Keiko's and Miles' Japanese-Irish marriage ceremony, and by her observance of other family traditions.[2]/nKeiko is played by Chinese-American actress Rosalind Chao,[3] who had first come to public attention playing Soon-Lee, the Korean wife of Max Klinger, in the final episode of M*A*S*H and in its spin-off AfterMASH. Actress Patti Yasutake \u2013 who would later play nurse Alyssa Ogawa on The Next Generation \u2013 auditioned unsuccessfully for the role.[4]/nChao also auditioned for the role of Tasha Yar, the Enterprise security chief from season 1.[5]/nThe character was introduced in the fourth season episode of The Next Generation, \"Data's Day\", which depicts her imminent wedding to Miles \u2013 which she temporarily cancels \u2013 as one of several subplots in which the main-cast character Data is involved. The words in their wedding were based on Captain Kirk's in the original series 1966 episode \"Balance of Terror\", according to writer Ronald D. Moore.[6]/nThe character appeared prominently the following season in the episode \"Disaster\", in which she gives birth to Keiko and Miles' first child Molly in the crew lounge Ten-Forward during a shipwide crisis.[6] Keiko is a central character in the sixth season episode \"Rascals\", in which she is temporarily transformed into a child and played by Caroline Junko King.[6][7]/nChao was offered a full-time role on Deep Space Nine, which she turned down because the demands on her would be too strenuous.[3] Keiko instead appears irregularly, with a focus on the impact of Miles\u2019s job on the O'Briens' relationship. Finding limited opportunity to use her botanical expertise, and concerned about the educational opportunities on the station for her daughter and others' children, she starts a school, where Jake Sisko and Nog are also students./nThe first season episode \"In the Hands of the Prophets\" shows Keiko in conflict with religious leader Vedek Winn over her teaching of science and a secular perspective on elements of Winn's Bajoran faith. In the fourth season episode \"Body Parts\", Keiko and her unborn child are injured, and to save the fetus it is placed into Major Kira's uterus to carry to term, as an in-story explanation for actress Nana Visitor's pregnancy. The couple and Kira form an awkward ad hoc family for the duration of the pregnancy, until their son Kirayoshi is born, in the fifth season episode \"The Begotten\". Meanwhile, Keiko has a central role in the fifth season episode \"The Assignment\", when she is possessed by a malevolent entity. During the Dominion War late in the series, Keiko and the children are evacuated from the war zone. After the war, Keiko and her family relocate to Earth, where Miles will be an instructor at Starfleet Academy./nKeiko has appeared in over twenty Star Trek novels.[8] Examples include The Fall: Revelation and Dust,[9] Warpath,[10] Warped,[11] and The Tempest.[12]/nKeiko was also released as a toy figurine, Playmates no. 65121.[13]/nViewers and critics had mixed reactions to the character. Some criticized her as unlikable and \"shrewish\", based on her abrupt (and short-lived) cancellation of her wedding to Miles, and her domestic expectations of him in Deep Space Nine episodes.[2] Appearing in only 8 episodes of The Next Generation, and 19 episodes of Deep Space Nine, she did not get as much character development as the primary characters, with an article on The Mary Sue complaining that her traits are largely a series of \"cultural stereotypes, likely checked off by a writer\u2019s room of non-Asian writers who really just weren\u2019t sure how to write a fully fleshed-out Asian character.\"[2] IndieWire ranked Keiko as only the 14th best out of 17 regular and recurring characters on The Next Generation.[1] A Screen Rant article argued, \"It's a struggle to come up with any compelling reasons why Keiko needed to exist\", and that the character overall \"hurt\" The Next Generation.[8]/nHowever, To Boldly Go: Essays on Gender and Identity in the Star Trek Universe argues that Keiko and Miles have the only successful long-term relationship in the entire Star Trek universe, noting that they are married in the fourth season of The Next Generation, have two children, and are still committed to each other at the conclusion of Deep Space Nine after nearly a decade.[14] CBR praised the character and her relationship with Miles as a realistic depiction of the strains that marriage can involve, and ranked Keiko the 7th best recurring character in all of Star Trek.[15][16] SyFy described her as \"fascinating\", rating her among the 21 most interesting supporting characters of the franchise.[17]/nIn 2020, ScreenRant suggested that Keiko and Miles would make a good spin-off series.[18]", "33529740": "R\u00fctger Wever was a German scientist, known for his significant contributions to the field of Chronobiology, including some of the first experiments on humans in time isolated environments./nR\u00fctger Wever's research focused on the human circadian rhythm, and how humans behave when placed in an environment where they have no external time cues and are free to choose their own sleep/wake and light/dark schedules. Working with his close collaborator J\u00fcrgen Aschoff, he had an underground bunker constructed in Andechs, Germany, for use as a laboratory in which human subjects could be shielded from any external time cues, including variations in light, temperature, and electromagnetic fields. Between 1964 and 1989, this bunker was used to conduct 418 studies in 447 human volunteers.[1]/nOne of the key findings of these experiments was that when free to self-select their schedules, humans run on an approximately 25-h day.[2] More recent experiments have shown that the intrinsic period of the human circadian pacemaker is actually 24.1-24.2 h.[3] However, when subjects are free to self-select their schedules, they choose to go to bed at a much later circadian phase, resulting in a lengthening of the sleep/wake cycle period due to the delaying effects of light exposure at these nighttime circadian phases.[4][5]/nAnother seminal finding that came out of the Andechs bunker experiments, was the discovery that human sleep/wake cycles could desynchronize from the circadian rhythm of core body temperature.[6] This phenomenon, called 'Spontaneous Internal Desynchrony', typically occurred in subjects after a duration of days to weeks. Strikingly, the length of the sleep/wake cycle varied significantly (from 12 h in some subjects to 68 h in others), while the core body temperature rhythm maintained a period close to 25 h. Under these conditions, subjects were typically unaware of the change in their sleep/wake cycle period.[7] The exact biological basis of this desynchronization remains unknown./nThe Andechs bunker was used to study human circadian rhythms under a range of conditions, including visual blindness and depression. The results improved understanding of the mechanisms that synchronize the circadian pacemaker to the environment, and had important implications for understanding the cyclicity of many affective disorders./nWever's background in Physics allowed him to develop some of the first mathematical oscillator models of the human circadian rhythm. This work helped to show that coupled oscillator models can reproduce many of the features of Spontaneous Internal Desynchrony,[8] and set the groundwork for later development of more sophisticated models.", "31661964": "Reuben Lasker (December 1, 1929 \u2013 March 12, 1988) was a fisheries scientist known for his contributions to larval ecology, particularly the Stable Ocean Hypothesis./nLasker was born to Theodore and Mary Lasker in Brooklyn, New York, on December 1, 1929.

This work in collaboration with Michael J Reed lead to  sulfamate-based drugs such as Irosustat (BN83495, STX64) [11][12][13] and E2MATE (PGL2001) that have completed many clinical trials in the UK, Europe, USA and Australia in women's health, including for hormone replacement therapy and endometriosis,[14][15] post-menopausal ER+ hormone dependent breast cancer,[16][17][18][19][20] advanced/metastatic or recurrent estrogen receptor-positive endometrial cancer[21][22] and castration-resistant prostate cancer[23][24] and Irosustat was also evaluated as a combination therapy with an oral epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients.[25] Irosustat is still progressing clinically. E2MATE/PGL2001 was well tolerated and for endometriosis first clinical trials showed that local endometrial STS could be reduced by 91% by a single dose of only 4\u00a0mg/per week of the drug alone and 96% in combination with a progestin.[15] A Phase II, multicentre, randomised, two-arm, parallel group, double-blind, placebo controlled, clinical study was initiated.[14] Results are awaited. In randomised phase II trials using Irosustat vs the current standard of care (megestrol acetate) in recurrent/metastatic post-menopausal endometrial cancer patients results showed clinical activity and a good safety profile. Pharmacodynamic proof of concept for Irosustat was demonstrated in prostate cancer patients with suppression of the non-sulfated androgens testosterone, androstenediol and DHEA. The most recent IRIS [26] and IPET [27] breast cancer clinical trials [19][20] met their clinical endpoints; results were discussed [28][29] and clinical benefit demonstrated for Irosustat both as a monotherapy in early breast cancer and in combination with an aromatase inhibitor.

The traditions of the biostation laid by Pavel Baranov, Ilariya Raikova,[c. 3] Oleg Zalensky and Kirill Stanyukovich found a decent continuation in the activities of Khudoyor Yusufbekov./nDuring his work at the Pamir Biostation, Khudoyor Yusufbekov strengthened the material and technical base of the biological station with trucks, laboratory equipment, and chemical reagents in order to improve the conditions of the Pamir expeditionary survey and continued to improve methods for improving the desert and steppe pastures of the Pamir-Alay, by studying the structure of vegetation, and the topographical and ecological conditions of high-mountain pastures in a wide geographical and high-altitude range./nAs a result, he developed a system of improving the feeding grounds of the Pamirs and the Alay Valley, differentiated by eco-geographical regions and high-altitude belts, and presented the findings in the form of a monograph published in 1968./nIn 1968, Khudoyor Yusufbekov was elected a Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences of the Tajik SSR./nIn 1969, the monograph \u00ab\u0423\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0431\u0438\u0449 \u0438 \u0441\u0435\u043d\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u041f\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430 \u0438 \u0410\u043b\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043d\u044b\u00bb (\"Improvement of pastures and hayfields of the Pamir and Alai Valley\") was presented as a thesis (Moscow, the Williams All-Union Feed Institute), which Khudoyor Yusufbekov successfully defended to receive the degree of Doctor of Agricultural Sciences.[1][2][3][6][11][13][14]/nIn October 1968, the President of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR Mstislav Keldysh arrived in the Pamirs and visited the Pamir Botanical Garden. He was accompanied by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Tajik SSR Abdulakhad Kakharov\u00a0[ru], the President of the academy of the Tajik SSR, Muhammad Osimi, and the First Secretary of the Gorno-Badakhshan Oblast Committee of the Communist Party of Tajikistan, Moyonsho Nazarchoev\u00a0[ru]. Khudoyor Yusufbekov reported in details history of Pamir study to the high-ranking guests, about its natural resources, about the problems that needed to be solved in the field of biology, agriculture and, at the end, having justified the question of the necessity of creating a biological institute in the Pamirs, he asked the support of Mstislav Keldysh in consideration and resolution of this issue in Moscow. With the expansion and deepening of research at the Pamir Biological station, as well as growth of the number of scientific staff and taking into account the unique conditions in Pamir and in order to coordinate all studies related to the arid mountain areas, he stressed out the importance of this./nSoon, the president of the Academy of Sciences of the Tajik SSR, Muhammad Osimi, and Khudoyor Yusufbekov were invited to Moscow to participate in the discussion of the establishment of a biological institute. At a joint meeting of the Presidium of the USSR Academy of Sciences and the USSR State Committee on Science and Technology, the issue was resolved positively.[3][15][16] In 1969, all the biological agencies of Pamir such as the Pamir Biological Station in the Eastern Pamir (3860 m above sea level), Pamir Botanical Garden near the town of Khorugh (2320 m above sea level), and the outpost in Ishkashim (2600 m above sea level) were combined by Khudoyor Yusufbekov into the Pamir Biological Institute,[11] the first director of which he became[7] after its foundation (1969\u20141981).[1][8] Currently, the institute is named after him (1992).[17]/nKhudoyor Yusufbekov's scientific and organizational abilities were revealed at the post of director of the institute. Along with scientific work, he also led a great deal of organizational activity. He determined the structure of the units of the Institute. Along with the traditional lines of research, he started scientific works on zoology, genetics plant breeding, and nature protection./nIn 1970\u20141975, Khudoyor Yusufbekov developed a scheme for the master plan for development of the Anatoly Gursky Pamir Botanical Garden.[8] To develop the scientific base, expand the areas of the botanical garden and preserve typical biological objects, more than 600 hectares of land in the vicinity of the botanical garden were obtained. In addition, 19 hectares of irrigated lands were connected to the territory of the garden, on the basis of which experimental sections of the Institute's units were organized. During the years of Khudoyor Yusufbekov's direct leadership (since 1965 till September 1990) of the fruit growing laboratory, situated at the altitude of 2700\u20133500 m, the area dedicated to the collection of global flora increased by 7 times, and the collection itself increased by 10 times, up to 4000 species and subspecies.[3] The collections of plants in the garden are arranged according to geographical principles, and the irrigated territory is divided into 5 floristic departments: Central Asia and East Asia, Europe and the Caucasus, North America, the Himalayas, and the Hindu Kush. Inside the departments, the plants are arranged in generic complexes, taking into account ecological features of the species. In accordance with specifics of the objects of research in the garden, three groups were formed: dendrology, fodder and medicinal plants, and floriculture. The main task of the Pamir Botanical Garden was the introduction of plants. It exchanged seeds of highland flora and planting material with 112 gardens inside the USSR and 118 gardens from 39 major botanical centers of Europe (East Germany, West Germany, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia), North America (Canada and the United States), and other countries of the world. In 1972, a pumping station was built, thanks to which the waters of the river Shahdara raised to a height of 180 m. This enabled expanding the irrigated territory from 22 to 118 hectares at an altitude of 2140\u20132360 m, by over 5 times. The area of 4 floristic departments increased by 2 \u2014 4 times. A laboratory, residential buildings, and the road and irrigation systems inside the garden of the Institute were built.[18][19][20]/nIn Darvaz, a support center for introduction and acclimatization of subtropical and citrus plants in an 8 hectare area. Initiated in 1975 under his leadership, the experiments on introduction of citrus and other subtropical cultures in Darvaz proved the prospects for development of citrus cultivation in the Kalayikhumb district of the GBAO. At the Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk Sovkhoz (state farm), a lemon orchard was planted on a 1 hectare area, as well as pomegranate and fig gardens on 8 hectares. To the same extent, studies of shape diversity and distribution of sea buckthorn were successfully launched in 1976. Several forms of low-thorned sea buckthorn with high oil content were identified. Expediency of cultivating sea buckthorn on pebbles in floodplains of Pamir rivers was proved./nKhudoyor Yusufbekov's scientific interests covered a wide range of issues related to study of the nature of the Pamirs. Along with solving the problem of improving pastures, he collected significant material on protection, restoration and purposeful reconstruction of the vegetation of the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region. In the monograph \"\u0420\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0417\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041f\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430 \u0438 \u043e\u043f\u044b\u0442 \u0435\u0451 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0438\" (\"The Vegetation of the Western Pamirs and the Experience of Its Reconstruction\"), written jointly by Okmir Agakhanyants\u00a0[ru; uk], the Pamirs' territorial resources were analyzed, and he introduced the concept of a testing ground for land development (\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0433\u043e\u043d \u043c\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438) of the Western Pamir. In that ground, he singled out 12 classes of land and provided valid recommendations for economic development of each of them. In the monograph, the model of the development of the Pamir, developed by Khudoyor Yusufbekov, is presented in the most complete form. Its constituent elements were the issues of complex vegetation reconstruction on sandy slopes and pebbles, furrowless watering on steep rocky slopes, reconstruction of vegetation of ancient terraces, mudflow cones of erosion, etc. Mountain slopes that had been eroded were supposed to be used in particular for orchards and meadowing between the plants by sowing perennial legumes. The scheme for reconstructing the vegetation of eroded slopes was not only developed, but also successfully tested in Shugnan, Rushan and Ishkashim districts of the GBAO./nRecommendations for the integrated reconstruction of vegetation on sands and gravels also found wide application in production. From just 1965 to 1980, the Gorno-Badakhshan forest organizarton created poplar and apricot plantations on an area of 1500 hectares. In the following years, planting works on blown sands and rocky terrain were conducted annually across an area of 300\u2013350 hectares.[11][18]/nThe main ideas and methods related to the plant development of the Pamirs were described by Khudoyor Yusufbekov in addition to the previously published works in the monographs \"\u041c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0434\u044b \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u041f\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0435\" (\"Methods of cultivating useful plants in the Pamirs\", 1972), \"\u0422\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0435\u043d \u043d\u0430 \u041f\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0435\" (\"Teresken in the Pamirs\", 1972), \"Pamir\" (1973) and in numerous brochures, collections and articles. At present more than 300 scientific works have been published.[3][8][11][18]/nA lot of work was done to prepare and grow the scientific staff of the Institute, taking into account the specific difficulties and the remoteness of the Pamirs from major scientific centers. By the end of 1975, the Pamir Biological Institute staff numbered over 100 people, of which 45 were researchers. Scientists from other regions of the Soviet Union were invited to work at the Institute, and concrete measures were taken to train personnel on the ground through postgraduate study and competition. During the period of the leadership of Khudoyor Yusufbekov, two doctoral and more than 30 candidate dissertations were defended by just the staff of the biostation and the institute alone. At the same time, communication with many research institutes of the USSR Academy of Sciences was established: Timiryazev Institute of Plant Physiology, Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy (IAE), the Institute of Botany, the Pavlovsky Institute of Zoology and Parasitology of the Academy of Sciences of the Tajik SSR, and other scientific research institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.[18][21]/nKhudoyor Yusufbekov's love for the nature of the Pamirs and his concern for the preservation of the natural environment and scientific history of the Pamirs also manifested in the fact that under his leadership the Museum \"The Nature of the Pamir\" was organized. Later, even when he was the rector of the Tajik Agricultural Institute, he continued to take an interest in the work and development of the museum, which is now very popular among visitors, including foreigners. Khudoyor Yusufbekov, wherever he worked, created museums in which it was possible to get acquainted with the history and achievements of science in a visual form. He believed that all this served the birth of innovative research and the continuation of scientific development in the future.[2][18]/nIn May 1981, Khudoyor Yusufbekov was transferred to work in Dushanbe at the post of rector of the Tajik Agricultural Institute of the Main Administration of Agricultural Higher Educational Institutions of the Ministry of Agriculture of the USSR (1981\u20141986).[c. 4] Here he paid much attention to development of research work at the departments and attraction of the students to the scientific research activities in the scientific and student councils. He systematically organized conferences, meetings, and symposiums on many aspects of agricultural science. The educational base of the Institute was strengthened so the students would master practical skills in solving specific production issues; for that, new educational facilities based on the sovkhoz \"Yavan-2\" of the Yavan district were organized. Khudoyor Yusufbekov made significant efforts to complete the construction of a new building of the zoological engineering faculty, which was completed in 1987. Khudoyor Yusufbekov organized new departments for the preparation of highly qualified specialists of fruit and wine growing, a laboratory for collective use of scientific devices at the agronomic faculty, a laboratory of computing machinery at the faculty of economics, and three new chairs at the institute. Under him, entrance examinations using computers were held for the first time, he also created a museum dedicated to the history of the Institute. As an specialist in the introduction of new species, Khudoyor Yusufbekov made an optimal decision to reconstruct and place green spaces on the territory adjacent to the institute. He conducted teaching activities at the department of agriculture, lectured at the course \"Meadow Fodder Production\" for students. He was the Chairman of the specialized scientific councils for protection of Ph.D. theses on specialties \"Plant Growing\" and \"Selection and Seed Farming\". While he had this job, Khudoyor Yusufbekov still continued to conduct scientific management of the subjects of research of the Pamir Botanical Garden and the laboratory of high-altitude fruit growing, as well as supervising the work of the graduate students.[1][2][6][11][13][22]/nKhudoyor Yusufbekov was the Academician Secretary of the Biological Department of the Academy of Sciences of Tajik SSR (1986\u20141990). He had a wide range of scientific interests in the field of biology. The Biological department of the Academy of Sciences of the Tajik SSR was one of its subunits. It consisted of scientific instituts devoted to biology-related issues like: botany, zoology and parasitology (the institute was named after academician Yevgeny Pavlovsky), physiology and biophysics of plants, gastroenterology, general genetics and safety, and rational utilization of natural resources. The Pamir Biological Institute, later named after Khudoyor Yusufbekov himself, was also included here. In 1989, he became the Member of the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences of the Tajik SSR. On his initiative, being at the same time the chairman of the Pamir scientific research base and a Member of the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences of the Tajik SSR, the Department of Pamir Studies from the Rudaki Institute of Language and Literature was relocated to Khorog from Dushanbe; the Department of Social and Economic Research of the Pamir Research Base in the Pamirs was established, later on the basis of these two departments after his death (11/27/1990), in 1991 the Institute of Humanities in the Pamirs was established[c. 5][1][2][6][10][11][13][17][23]/nIn 1990, Khudoyor Yusufbekovich Yusufbekov fell sick, passing away at the Dushanbe hospital No. 4 on November 27 of that year. On the request of the leadership of the Tajik SSR and the Academy of Science of the Tajik SSR, his body had been transported by plane to the town of Khorog where he was buried in the Pamir Botanical Garden, on the top of the highest hill.[1][2][6][11][24]/nHe participated in the work of all-Union, republican scientific councils and editorial boards of scientific journals:/nThe pre-revolutionary period of research on the nature of the Pamirs is associated with the names of zoologists Alexei Pavlovich Fedchenko and Nikolai Severtzov, geologists Ivan Mushketov and Dmitriy Ivanov\u00a0[ru], botanists Olga Fedchenko, Arnold Regel\u00a0[ru], Sergey Korzhinskiy\u00a0[ru], Nikolai Vavilov and others.

He then focused on exploring the molecular machines, the ion channels, that generate bioelectricity in the brain, peripheral nervous system, heart, muscles, vessels and hormone-secreting endocrine systems and are responsible for multiple pathologies.[5][6] He played a pioneering role in the analysis of ion channels permeable to sodium, calcium and potassium. He played a pioneering role in the study of their pharmacology by introducing many toxins, many venoms and important drugs for hypertension (calcium blockers) or diabetes (antidiabetic sulfonylureas)[5][6][7] The most recent work of his team has completed these pharmacological studies and amplified the discovery of new substances from venom with strong potential therapeutic possibilities. They have also led to the discovery of several new classes of ion channels essential for the sensory perception of mechanical stimuli, heat, cold and acidity. TREK/TRAAK channels, TASK channels and ASIC channels.[5][6][8] These families of channels play an essential role in pain perception but also in synaptic transmission and neuroprotection at the cerebral level, particularly for polyunsaturated fatty acids of the \u026f\u025c type. TREK channels play a central role in depression.[9] The TASK and TREK channels are a major therapeutic target for gaseous anesthetics.[5][6][10]/nPreviously, Michel Lazdunski and his team had made pioneering discoveries on the CFTR[5][11] channel associated with cystic fibrosis, which indicated the direction to follow for current therapeutic developments on some forms of this genetic disease.", "70459316": "Leroy James Lowe (born May 22, 1963) is a Canadian biologist best known for his \u201cLow Dose Theory of Carcinogenesis\u201d, the \u201cBroad-spectrum approach to Cancer Therapy\u201d, and for his efforts to define \u201cThe Human Affectome\u201d in the field of neuroscience.[1][2] He is the Co-Founder and President of Getting to Know Cancer, the Founder and President of Neuroqualia, and a faculty member at the International Business at the Nova Scotia Community College./nIn 1986, Lowe obtained a B.Sc. and a Diploma in Engineering at Saint Mary\u2019s University and then joined the Canadian Airforce.

The aim of the project was to produce a series of overarching reviews of the cancer hallmarks that would collectively assess biologically disruptive chemicals that might be acting in concert with other seemingly innocuous chemicals and contributing to various aspects of carcinogenesis.[8][9]/nResearchers were organized into twelve teams, and in total, the researchers reviewed 85 examples of chemicals for actions on key pathways/mechanisms related to carcinogenesis.\u00a0 The taskforce concluded that low-dose exposures to disruptive chemicals that are not individually carcinogenic may be capable of instigating and/or enabling carcinogenesis.[10][11]/nIn the other half of the Halifax Project, Lowe focused on the fact that cancer research had centered primarily on molecular targets for therapeutics, which had achieved notable successes in some cancers, but noted that disease relapse is still common in many cancers due to disease heterogeneity.\u00a0 Lowe noted that attempts to treat this sort of relapse often involves simple combinations of chemotherapy that cannot reach enough molecular targets so many refractory cancers are unstoppable.[2][6]/nIn this effort, 180 researchers were organized into twelve teams using the Hallmarks of Cancer as an organizing framework. The researchers then tried to identify friendlier chemicals, many of which come from plants and foods that could be combined to reach many targets (key anticancer receptors, pathways, and mechanisms) with little to no toxicity at therapeutic doses. \u00a0This was intended to address the two major issues of therapeutic resistance and cost./nThe interdisciplinary teams reviewed each hallmark area and nominated a wide range of high-priority targets (74 in total) that could be modified to improve patient outcomes. For these targets, corresponding low-toxicity therapeutic approaches were then suggested, many of which were phytochemicals. The task force concluded that a broad-spectrum approach should be feasible from a safety standpoint, that the approach would be relatively inexpensive to implement, and that it should help us address stages and types of cancer that lack conventional treatment, and potentially reduce risk of relapse.[2][12]/nLowe\u2019s research and focus on feelings and emotions began in 2001 when he was working on his PhD in Management. Although his first PhD attempt was interrupted, he explained that while he spent a decade-and-a-half focused on cancer research, he continued to follow the research on feelings and emotions and ultimately had the idea that affective neuroscientists needed a comprehensive and robust functional model that could serve as a common focal point for research in the field.[13] To develop this model, Lowe used the same approach that he used for the Halifax project. He launched an NGO called Neuroqualia[14] and described the problem on a dedicated project website.

He is currently the Nathan Smith Professor of Molecular and Systems Biology at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth. He and his colleague Jennifer Loros have mentored numerous students and postdoctoral fellows, many of whom presently hold positions at various academic institutions./nBorn in Ludlow, Massachusetts on May 9, 1952, Jay Dunlap grew up in York, Pennsylvania as the third of four children.[1] Dunlap became interested in biochemical oceanography during a high school summer program and decided to pursue this interest in college. He graduated with a B.S. in oceanography and a B.S. in chemistry from the University of Washington in 1974.[1]/nDunlap originally planned to pursue oceanography in his graduate studies. However, after meeting with John Woodland Hastings, who studied the circadian regulation of bioluminescence in marine organisms, Dunlap decided to study biology in graduate school at Harvard University. While studying with Hastings, Dunlap changed his field of study to circadian biology.[1][2]/nFor his postdoctoral fellowship, Dunlap attended the University of California, Santa Cruz and started working with Jerry Feldman, who had successfully isolated clock gene mutants in Neurospora that have abnormally long or short circadian-oscillation periods. Dunlap was unable to clone frequency, a gene that has an important role in the transcription-translation negative feedback-loop (TTFL) that drives circadian rhythms in Neurospora, as the Santa Cruz lab did not have the molecular tools necessary to study Neurospora's molecular biology in depth.[3] Dunlap learned basic molecular techniques as he worked alongside fellow biology graduate students in other labs. At one point, Dunlap worked with Harry F. Noller, a renowned biochemist whose lab had \"unofficially adopted\" Dunlap.[3]/nIn 1984, Dunlap secured a junior faculty position at the Department of Biochemistry at Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth. He became a professor of Biochemistry in 1994 before being named the Inaugural Chair of the Department of Genetics in 1999. In 2010, Dunlap was named Nathan Smith Professor, and in 2016, he was appointed inaugural chair of the Department of Molecular and Systems Biology which subsumed Genetics and other departments.[4]/nWorking closely with Jennifer Loros' laboratory, Dunlap's research has primarily focused on the molecular basis of circadian rhythms using Neurospora as a model system to further understand the mammalian circadian clock. Although clock gene mutations were also identified in Drosophila and Chlamydomonas,[1] Dunlap studied Neurospora in his postdoctoral work, as a wider array of biochemical and genetic tools were applicable to the species at the time.[3] Neurospora was a simple model organism and a powerful tool to study molecular genetics; its then-unknown molecular clock presented a great opportunity for exploration.[4]/nBased on the work of Dunlap and others, clock genes are now understood to encode proteins that participate in a self maintaining negative feedback loop: transcriptional activators drive expression of specific clock gene mRNAs, which are translated into clock proteins, which enter the nucleus and act to depress the activity of the transcriptional activators driving the expression of the clock genes.[5] However, clock genes were not yet cloned when Dunlap began his research as an assistant professor in 1984. Dunlap correctly predicted that single cells, including mammalian cells, can act as autonomous oscillators with their own intrinsic circadian rhythms.[6]/nDunlap deciphered the circadian system by framing and addressing three problems in cellular metabolism:/nPrior to the adoption of transcriptional reporters such as luciferase, studies of the Neurospora circadian clock utilized the rhythmic development of asexual spores (conidia), assayed using a race tube.[7] Conidial production peaks in the subjective night\u2014a behavioral phenotype lacking in arrhythmic strains. During her graduate work, Jennifer Loros observed mutant frq9 as a recessive, arrhythmic, and phenotypically null allele at the frq gene.[8] Her observation, combined with the ability to transform Neurospora with exogenous DNA, provided the basis for a novel strategy to clone frq, namely by transformation-based rescue of the null mutant behavioral phenotype. Utilizing a bidirectional chromosome walk beginning at oli, a gene on the same linkage group as frq, Dunlap and colleagues walked over 200kb across frq.[3] The location of frq was verified in 1986 through transformation of cosmids into frq9 and by rescuing the circadian rhythm. frq was thus the second clock gene to be cloned, following Drosophila per.  Furthermore, the lab manually sequenced roughly 9kb and conducted transcript mapping on the frq genomic region; the results were published in Nature in 1989.[3] In subsequent work, Dunlap and colleagues showed that frq was rhythmically expressed and were able to manipulate the expression of frq sufficiently to create a null mutant. They implemented a system in which a heterologous promoter\u2014induced in a manner that did not affect the clock\u2014could be used to drive regulated expression of frq. Using this system, they demonstrated that the product of frq acted to repress its own synthesis; it was autoregulatory. Dunlap and colleagues observed that the continual over-expression of frq resulted in arrhythmicity, and they defined the phase of clock's rhythm to be the time at which the cell returned to normal expression levels of frq. They concluded, in a Science article in 1994, that the core pacemaker of the Neurospora clock is regulated via negative feedback by clock proteins, and frq determines its own expression through auto-regulation via negative feedback, demonstrating that intracellular, auto-regulatory negative feedback is the basis of a circadian oscillator.[9][10]/nDunlap's work on the auto-regulatory mechanism included modeling the circadian clock's negative feedback loop and discovering the roles and connections between activators (which he identified as proteins with PAS domains) and repressors (products of the clock genes).[11] Additionally, Dunlap demonstrated the role of protein phosphorylation in the clock mechanism and has done research involving the role of these proteins (namely Casein Kinase 2) on the temperature compensation mechanism. In 2009, Dunlap and colleagues showed that the FRQ protein is phosphorylated at over 100 sites in a highly reproducible and time-of-day-specific manner[12] and that casein kinase 2 establishes and maintains temperature compensation within the circadian clock.[13] Four years later in 2013, Dunlap and colleagues found that FRQ is an Intrinsically Disordered Protein whose stability is determined by its interaction with partner protein FRH. Additionally, Dunlap and colleagues discovered that the daily phosphorylation of FRQ governs its ability to interact with the proteins in the negative element complex.[14] The kinetics of these circadian processes, Dunlap discovered, are heavily influenced by progressive phosphorylation of FRQ.[15]/nAfter identifying frq as a clock gene whose product's abundance tends to be variable and rhythmic, Dunlap, Loros, and colleagues showed how environmental regulation of its expression led to understanding the molecular basis of circadian entrainment by light: through the induction of expression of frq by light.[16]/nIn 1995, Loros and Dunlap worked to uncover the molecular basis underlying how light resets the clock, a mechanism later shown in collaborative work with Hitoshi Okamura to be conserved in mammals.[17] The daily cycle in frq transcript levels, combined with the ability of light to acutely induce frq expression, explained light resetting (the advances and delays seen on a phase response curve). If light was provided and induced frq-mRNA when it was rising to peak levels (late subjective night), light would rapidly bring frq-mRNA levels to peak values, resulting in an advance. If light induced frq-mRNA while its levels were falling (early subjective night), frq-mRNA would rapidly go back to peak levels causing a phase delay. The results of this investigation led to the conclusion that the light induction of frq is responsible for the phase-specific advances and delays observed in Neurospora and provided a general explanation for how the unidirectional response of a clock component to an environmental signal (light) could result in a bidirectional time-of-day specific clock response (advances or delays): the basis for circadian entrainment.[2] These experiments eventually led to the universal recognition of entrainment via light-induced changes in a specific variable of the circadian oscillator, later observed in Drosophila and mammals./nThe mechanism through which frq is induced by light was unknown at the time that entrainment was explained, and studies aimed at identifying the proteins responsible for light-induction of frq led to the identification of White Collar-1 and White Collar-2 as components of the circadian activator complex.[18] Work by Giuseppe Macino had shown White Collar-1 to associate via PAS domains with White Collar-2 to create the White Collar Complex; Dunlap, Loros and colleagues showed how this heterodimeric complex is the transcription factor that acts in the dark to drive expression of frq, thereby acting as the activator in the circadian negative feedback loop. This observation associated specific biochemical activities, DNA binding and transcriptional activation, with known clock proteins, allowing the formulation of the oscillator as a single step transcription-translation negative feedback loop.[18] Later, in 1997, the first mammalian clock gene (CLOCK) was shown to encode a protein similarly having PAS domains and, later, to associate via PAS domains with a different protein, BMAL1, again forming a heterodimeric protein complex that acted as a transcriptional activator; similar proteins were identified in 1998 in Drosophila. This confirmed a common model for the transcription-translation negative feedback loops in fungi and animals: a positive element composed of two different proteins interacting via PAS domains drives expression of negative elements such as FRQ or PER that, in association with other proteins, represses the activity of heterodimeric activators: negative feedback.[19] These observations contributed to the naming of Circadian Rhythms as first runner up to Breakthrough of the Year in Science magazine in 1997./nAlthough it was established that heterodimeric WC-1/WC-2 transcription factor was required for light-induction of frq, researchers believed that WC-1 and WC-2 did not have a direct role in the process of photoreception. WC-1/WC-2 transcription factor was instead assumed to be the final target of a signal transduction cascade initiated by the action of light on a distinct blue light photoreceptor. In 2002, Dunlap and colleagues biochemically studied WC-1/WC-2 in vitro to show that WC-1 bound FAD as a cofactor (also shown independently by Yi Liu), and analysis of binding to DNA by the WC-1/WC-2 complex showed that light resulted in a structural change in the heterodimer. The dose response and action spectrum for this in vitro structural change in WC-1 was FAD-dependent and matched the in vivo dose response and action spectrum for light-suppression of circadian banding determined by Briggs and colleagues in 1967. These findings revealed that WC-1 is a blue light photoreceptor and a circadian photoreceptor; the signal transduction cascade from photoreceptor to transcription factor happens all within the same protein.[21][15] WC-1 is the founding member for the family of blue-light photoreceptors common to all fungi.[22] Circadian photoreceptors were later identified in animals and green plants and shown to be distinct from WC-1./nIn 1989, Dunlap's work with Jennifer Loros led to the first targeted screen for genes regulated by the circadian clock, paving the way for the systematic dissection of clock output pathways.[23] The term \"clock-controlled genes\" (CCGs) was coined in this study. CCGs are defined as genes whose level of expression is regulated by the circadian clock but whose activities do not impact the operation of the clock. Circadian control of gene expression is now widely thought to be the principal means through which clocks control the biology of the cells in which they operate.  Subsequent work expanded the universe of CCGs in Neurospora, and later in mammalian cells,[24] and revealed the connection between the circadian and cell cycles in which the clock regulates the DNA damage response which, in turn, can regulate the clock.[25] The search for CCGs finally culminating in the complete description of the circadian transcriptome of Neurospora where as much as 40% of the genome is controlled on a daily basis by the clock.[26]/nJay Dunlap\u2019s graduate work at Harvard with J.W. Hastings focused on bioluminescence in the marine organism Gonyaulax. Their work uncovered the structure of Gonyaulax luciferin. After purifying luciferase, they determined that it was regulated through daily synthesis and destruction.[3] This was one of the first clock-regulated enzymes whose method of regulation was determined under experimental conditions. One part of the mechanism is that Gonyaulax produces luciferin and luciferase at night when the emitted light can be seen, while production of the substrate and protein decreases at dawn. The realization that a complete understanding of this biochemical process would also require a combined genetics approach led Dunlap to begin his study of the circadian clock of the Neurospora.[2]/nDunlap and colleagues later developed bioluminescence as a reporter for gene expression in Neurospora. Prior to the use of bioluminescence the only assay for rhythmicity in Neurospora was the daily cycle in asexual development (conidiation). As a result, strains bearing mutations that interfered with development could not be accurately assayed for rhythmicity. Dunlap, along with Jennifer Loros, Arun Mehra, and Van Gooch, adapted firefly luciferase for expression in Neurospora, thereby greatly expanding the ability to analyze strains.[7] frq-promoter-driven luciferase is an exquisitely sensitive reporter for the core oscillator and has been used show that developmental rhythms that do not require frq are not truly circadian,[27] and that daily phosphorylation of FRQ protein, but not daily turnover of FRQ protein, is required for closing of the negative feedback loop.[28] The novel method used by Dunlap and his colleagues to characterize and use the luciferase gene improved expression by 3 log orders and allowed for the correction of several errors in the Neurospora literature. Dunlap and Loros collaborated with Cassius Stevani to show that bioluminescence of the basidiomycete (mushroom) Neonothopanus gardneri is regulated by circadian rhythms through regulated expression of the luciferase, luciferin, and a required reductase.[29] N. gardneri is found growing beneath palms in the Amazonian forest and the nocturnal bioluminescence is believed to be used by the fungus to attract insects at night as an aid to spore dispersal.[30]/nDunlap and his colleagues have contributed greatly to advancements in the use of technology within the field of molecular biology. These methodological advancements have had major implications for both fungal biology and chronobiology and their future directions. For example, Dunlap's lab developed the first gene replacement for Neurospora in 1991. These technologies as well as Dunlap's support greatly contributed to the sequencing of the Neurospora genome (which was accomplished in 2002). Subsequently, Dunlap and his team improved gene replacements. He spearheaded the push to knock out all 10,000 genes in the Neurospora genome and construction of a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism map. Finally, Dunlap revolutionized the role of luciferase expression by examining codon bias and is using its implications in Neurospora and other organisms.[7]/nDunlap continues to investigate the circadian clock, using Neurospora and other organisms, such as Aspergillus fumigatus.[31] As a result of the Neurospora crassa Genome Project,[32] the results of which were published in 2003, and the development of knockouts for every gene, which are stored at the Fungal Genetics Stock Center, Dunlap believes the molecular basis for the circadian clock of Neurospora may be the first to be completely understood. Due to the highly conserved nature of biological clocks, clock mechanisms have evolved relatively few times and are similar between species. Knowledge of Neurospora systems may lead to applications with relevance to human health. The circadian nature of cellular processes in humans may be leveraged to target cancerous cells more effectively and treat sleep abnormalities./nDunlap is also interested in the interaction between biological clocks and metabolic processes. While circadian rhythms govern aspects of metabolism, metabolic products may feedback to an organism's internal clock.[33] This form of communication may prove to be an adaptive feature of biological clocks and enable beneficial responses to changes in environment. Additionally, Dunlap works with William Cannon and Jennifer Hurley to develop mathematical models describing circadian clock function. This effort will make use of statistical techniques to model both reactions occurring in metabolism and the overall clock./nDunlap has also been involved in work examining the hierarchical network of transcription factors that govern circadian output. The core oscillator generates rhythmic activity of the heterodimeric circadian activator (WC-1/WC-2 or CLOCK/BMAL1), but the peak activity is restricted to one time of day. Thus, in Neurospora, the core oscillator that generates time creates rhythmic activity of the WC-1/WC-2 heterodimer that peaks in the morning. WC-1/WC-2 sits on top of a network of transcription factors where different tiers of regulators work together to act as a dynamic filter for time information, changing the morning peak activity of WC-1/WC-2 into a signal that can drive circadian gene expression at all times of day. A part of this is the transcription factor ADV-1.[34] This factor, found in Neurospora, responds to light and regulates genes involved in processes such as cell growth./nRecently, Dunlap looked into the evolutionary conservation of the circadian clock among species. Specifically, he found that proteins conserved in biological clock mechanisms among three species (Drosophila melanogaster, Neurospora crassa and Mus musculus) all exhibit high amounts of intrinsic protein disorder. Intrinsically disordered proteins do not have a stable secondary structure. Throughout the day, these proteins have different levels of disorder. The changing levels of disorder allow for a stable circadian rhythm. Dunlap concluded that because disordered proteins are so conserved among different species, the proteins must be essential for the control of the circadian rhythms across species.[35]/nIn his most recent work, Dunlap's lab examined regulators of the mRNAs encoding the Casein Kinase 1 protein; one such regulator is an RNA-binding protein translated from the prd-2 gene. They examined two mutations (created by inversion of a part of the prd-2 gene) and found that these mutations drastically affected Casein Kinase levels. These mutations caused circadian periods much greater than 24 hours. He and his colleagues genetically increased the Casein Kinase 1 levels and found that the period was restored when Casein Kinase 1 levels increased. They concluded that the circadian period is dependent on Casein Kinase 1 levels.[36]/nDuring Dunlap's time at Santa Cruz, one of the biology graduate students he met was Jennifer Loros. They forged a permanent relationship and were married on September 1, 1984. They have two children.

It describes abuses spanning over 18 years (during the tenures of Chancellor Michael Hooker, Chancellor James Moeser, Chancellor Holden Thorp), including \"no-show\" classes that had little to no faculty oversight. Approximately half of the enrollees in these \"no-show\" classes were athletes./nWhen the Wainstein Report was released in 2014, Folt acknowledged \"It is just very clear that it was an academic issue with the way the courses were administered, and it is clearly an athletics issue.\" The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, the regional accreditation body for UNC, took the nearly unprecedented step of placing UNC on a year of probation, wherein any further missteps would lead to the university's accreditation being removed, effectively dooming the entire university. Folt brought forth reforms on several levels, and the probation was consequently lifted with no further sanctions after a year./nWhile not nearly as important for the well-being of the university as a whole, UNC also faced the possibility of serious sanctions from the NCAA. Under Folt's leadership, the university later went on to deny that the academic fraud was specifically benefiting athletics in its defense to the NCAA, broadly attempting to insulate the UNC administration from the findings of the Wainstein Report and the allegations of UNC whistleblower Mary Willingham. One of the key assertions the university made in its own defense was that the NCAA did not have jurisdiction, since the university created and offered \"no-show\" courses not as part of a systemic effort to benefit athletes, but the student body in general.[16] While citing the failure of multiple UNC administrators to cooperate with the investigation, the NCAA's Committee on Infractions did not hold UNC responsible, finding that \"no-show\" classes were not specifically designed to benefit athletes.[17] This finding led both fans and media across the country to question \"the integrity of the NCAA, suggesting that UNC's case would open the doors for other universities to set up similar no-show classes so long as non-athletes could enroll.\"[18]/nDuring her term as chancellor, Folt had to deal with the controversy over the monument Silent Sam, which at times included demonstrators outside her office.[19] Folt resigned as chancellor on January 14, 2019, effective end of the spring semester, stating: \"There has been too much recent disruption due to the monument controversy\".

He shifted to the Pennsylvania State University to obtain MS in genetics in 1979, and subsequently a similar master's degree from University of Wisconsin, Madison in 1981. His master's degree was on evolutionary genetics of salmonid fish. Captivated by the emerging research on mitochondrial DNA, in 1981 he joined Allan Wilson, a renowned biochemist at the Department of Biochemistry, University of California, Berkeley, under whose supervision he got a PhD in 1986. His research was on human mtDNA variation, a follow-up of the work of Rebecca Cann, who was just completing her doctoral thesis from the same supervisor. He continued as Postdoctoral Fellow in 1986 at Berkeley and completed it in 1988.[1][2]/nIn 1989, he joined the Human Genome Center at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley, as a Staff Scientist. Then he worked as an Associate Research Scientist at the Department of Human Genetics, Cetus Corporation, Emeryville, California for a year. In 1990, he entered the faculty of Assistant Professor the Department of Anthropology, Pennsylvania State University as assistant professor. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1994 and a full professor in 1998. During 1996-1997 he served as a visiting professor at the Zoology Institute, University of Munich, Germany. In 1999, he got an appointment in the Department of Evolutionary Genetics, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, as the Group Leader. He concurrently serves as an Honorary Professor of Biological Anthropology at the University of Leipzig./nHe has been an Associate Editor of the Journal of Human Evolution (from 1990 to 1993),  Human Biology (1993\u20131997), BioEssays (2004 to present), Anthropological Science, (2004 to present), Evolutionary Biology (Springer Nature, 2007 to present), BMC Genetics (2008 to present), Gene (2009\u20132010), Investigative Genetics (2009 to present), EMBO Reports (2010 to present), and Language Dynamics and Change (2010 to present).

He started under the supervision of Allan Wilson and following the pioneering work of his senior graduate student, Rebecca Cann. Cann had collected data from different human populations, including those of Asians, Africans, and Europeans. Then Stoneking added data from aboriginal Australians and New Guineans. In 1987, after a year of pending, their paper was published in Nature in which their findings indicated that all living humans were descended through a single mother, who lived ~200,000 years ago in Africa.[3] The common hypothetical mother is dubbed Mitochondrial Eve, and the concept directly implies recent African origin of modern humans, hence, the underpinning of the so-called \"Recent Out of Africa\" theory.[4] In spite of criticisms, and religious antagonisms, even after two decades he still holds this view to be as valid as any scientific theory since a number independent research also corroborates their original human mtDNA phylogenetic tree.[5]/nStoneking has appeared in[12]", "39100385": "Michael Menaker (May 19, 1934 \u2013 February 14, 2021),[1] was an American chronobiology researcher, and was Commonwealth Professor of Biology at University of Virginia. His research focused on circadian rhythmicity of vertebrates, including contributing to an understanding of light input pathways on extra-retinal photoreceptors of non-mammalian vertebrates, discovering a mammalian mutation for circadian rhythmicity (tau mutation in golden hamsters), and locating a circadian oscillator in the pineal gland of bird. He wrote almost 200 scientific publications.[2]/nMenaker grew up in New York City and attended Swarthmore College./nAfter graduating from Swarthmore College in 1955 with a B.A. in biology, Menaker went on to Princeton University.[3] In the lab of Colin Pittendrigh,[4][5] the father of research on biological clocks, Menaker studied the endogenous circadian rhythm of bats (Myotis lucifugus).[6]/nHe graduated from Princeton University with a Ph.D. in 1960, and continued postdoctoral studies in Donald Griffin's lab [5] at Harvard University.[3] As he continued to study bats, his interest shifted from circadian rhythms to hibernation patterns.[7] When Menaker joined faculty at University of Texas at Austin in 1962,[4] he transitioned to studying circadian rhythms in the house sparrow (Passer domesticus)[8] and the golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus).[9]/nMenaker has held academic positions at the University of Texas, University of Oregon, and more recently, at University of Virginia, where he has been the Commonwealth Professor of Biology since 1987.[3] He served as Chairman of the Biology Department at Virginia from 1987 to 1993.[3] He has mentored several experts in the field of chronobiology, including Joseph Takahashi,[10] Chair of the Neuroscience Department at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; Heidi Hamm, Chair of the Pharmacology Department at Vanderbilt University; and Carl Johnson Professor of Biological Sciences at Vanderbilt University. He has authored almost 200 papers and maintained grant funding to support his research for over 60 years.[5]/nIn 1968, Menaker provided evidence for the existence of extra-retinal photoreceptors that were sufficient for photoentrainment by measuring rhythmic locomotor behavior as the output signal of the house sparrows (Passer domesticus) circadian clock. He demonstrated that photoentrainment could occur in the absence of optic neurons, evidence for the presence of an extra-retinal photoreceptor(s) coupled to the House Sparrow circadian clock.[11] In this experiment, bilaterally enucleated house sparrows were exposed to an artificial light-dark cycle. They were kept in constant darkness to determine their free-running period and subsequently allowed to entrain to light cues. Locomotor activity was recorded through observing perching behavior of the sparrows. He tested three possible confounding variables for entrainment: (1) temperature fluctuation, (2) post-enucleation retinal fragments remaining in the eye, and (3) ectoparasites that might transfer light information through their movements in the birds' skin. To study the effects of temperature on circadian rhythms, Menaker exposed the enucleated sparrows to an electroluminescent panel. Menaker treated sparrows with Dry-Die, an anti-parasitic agent, to eliminate any possible effects of light transferring by ectoparasites. Since the sparrows did not entrain during tests of temperature fluctuation and the sparrows remained entrained 10 months after enucleation, a point at which any excess of the functional retina would have degraded, Menaker ruled out these possible confounding variables.[8] Menaker's lab concluded the sparrows were able to entrain to environmental light cues. These results demonstrate that retinal light receptors are not necessary for photoentrainment, indicating there is an extra-retinal photoreceptor(s) contributing to circadian locomotor activity. Menaker's findings in enucleated sparrows were consistent with Aschoff's Rule, and he concluded that the retinae and the extra-retinal receptor(s) both contribute to the photoentrainment process./nIn 1979, Menaker and Natille Headrick Zimmerman expanded on Menaker's previous work with house sparrows, by exploring the influence of the pineal gland and hypothalamus on circadian rhythms. They transplanted the pineal tissue of one sparrow into the anterior chamber of the eyes of an arrhythmic, pinealectomized sparrow. Prior to the transplantation procedure, the donor birds were entrained to a 12:12 light:dark photoperiod cycle. This allowed them to compare the onset of activity, measured by perching patterns, of the donors before pineal transplantation and the recipients after transplantation. Upon receiving pineal tissue transplantation, previously arrhythmic sparrows experienced the reestablishment of rhythmicity. In fact, their reestablished circadian oscillations resembled the circadian oscillation pattern for locomotor activity of the donor sparrows. The 20% of the sparrows who had successful transplantations showed temporary arrhythmicity in constant darkness for a period of 10 to 100 days, which was not always evenly distributed in the 24-hour day; the sparrows, however, eventually became rhythmic once again.[12] Menaker concluded the pineal gland is a driving oscillator within a multi-component system./nIn 1988, Martin Ralph and Menaker serendipitously came across a tau mutant male golden hamster in a shipment from their commercial supplier, Charles River Laboratories, that was observed to have a circadian period significantly shorter than what is characteristic of that breed. These golden hamsters are recognized for their narrow range of periods with a typical mean of 24 hours.[13] Thus, rather than overlooking this abnormal male hamster, Menaker conducted breeding experiments to produce homozygous tau mutants with a period of 20 hours and heterozygous tau mutants with a period of 22 hours. The pattern of inheritance from this shortened tau indicated the genetic cause of this phenotype was isolated to a single allele, providing a genetic approach to the determination of the biological mechanism.[14] This accidental forward genetic screen yielded the first specimen that could be studied for genetic insight into mammalian circadian mechanisms./nThe first major finding with this strain was that the oscillator had to be located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).[14] To test this conclusion, Menaker and colleagues conducted experiments whereby the SCN from a tau mutant hamster was transplanted through a neural graft to a wild-type hamster with an ablated SCN. After this procedure, the formerly wild-type hamster displayed a shortened period which resembled the tau mutant. This result led to the conclusion that the SCN is sufficient and necessary for mammalian circadian rhythms.[14]/nFurther investigation of the SCN as a central structure of circadian rhythms by Silver, et al. found that the SCN can control circadian rhythmicity by a diffusive signal.[15] They transplanted the SCN as previously done by Menaker, but they encapsulated the graft thus preventing outgrowth by mutant SCN neurons. Even with the SCN restrained in this way the wild type hamster displayed a shorter period consistent with the period of the SCN donated by the mutant tau hamster, suggesting the SCN emits diffusable factors to control circadian rhythms.[15] That same year, Gianluca Tosini and Menaker also determined that hamster retinas cultured in vitro produced a consistent circadian rhythm, as measured by melatonin levels.[16] This suggests that there are multiple oscillators, or multiple neurons that compose a single oscillator sufficient for circadian outputs./nIt was still uncertain as to exactly which genetic locus the tau mutation was found, and which protein it affected. In 2000, Menaker collaborated with other scientists in the field to use genetically directed representational difference analysis (GDRDA), a new technique in molecular genetics that allowed them to accomplish this goal.[17]/nGDRDA works by first generating polymorphic genetic markers for a monogenic trait (which the tau has already been proven to be) that can be directly identified in the genome. This is done by separating progeny from a cross, based on the phenotype of interest and then creating amplicons of pooled DNA from each group. With these groups of amplified DNA, it can be determined which loci are enriched in the group exhibiting the phenotype of interest. These enriched loci are the genetic markers for the trait of interest./nThe genetic markers for the tau mutants mapped to chromosome 22. The region of conserved synteny was the gene casein kinase I epsilon (CKIe). This is consistent with CKIe's homology to the Drosophila circadian control gene doubletime (dbt). From this work it was also shown that CK1e could interact with the mammalian PERIOD protein in vitro and effect the expression of Per1. From this work, the Takahashi lab successfully validated the tau mutant genetically by discovering the affected locus and subsequently established a model of circadian protein interaction by which the effects of the tau mutation could be explained./nAlthough previous studies demonstrate that methamphetamine (MAP) has a significant effect on the circadian behavior of rats, suggesting evidence of the SCN-independent, MAP-sensitive circadian oscillator (MASCO), Menaker and colleagues chose to look at MASCO in mice.[18] The work done by Menaker and colleagues looked at the effects of chronic MAP expression on two strains of intact and SCN-lesioned mice in constant dark and constant light conditions./nMAP in the drinking water generated circadian locomotor rhythmicity in SCN lesioned mice. When MAP was removed, the free-running locomotor rhythm persisted for as long as fourteen cycles. This study also showed that small increases in MAP caused an increase in daily wheel-running activity and the length of the circadian period for intact mice and SCN-lesioned mice in constant dark and constant light conditions. The observations of Menaker and colleagues indicate that MASCO, a circadian oscillator, functions separately from the \"master clock\" of the SCN and is sufficient for locomotor circadian rhythm control./nThis study disproves the \"hourglass\" mechanism hypothesis for MASCO proposed by Ruis, et al. This hypothesis states that the spontaneous consumption of MAP in drinking water by rodents results in lengthened bouts of activity, followed by sleep. The cycle is reinforced when the animal awakes and drinks once more.[19] Menaker and colleagues tested SCN-lesioned, arrhythmic mice in constant darkness and found that when the MAP was no longer consumed at rhythmic intervals, constant rhythms in locomotor behavior were still found. In another trial, MAP was alternated every other day with water, and locomotor rhythm persisted on days with just the water. Both of these findings made clear that the \"hourglass\" hypothesis for the mechanism of MASCO was not valid.[20]/nMenaker and colleagues investigated if MASCO affected the molecular feedback loop underlying the currently accepted model for circadian rhythmicity in mammals. This investigation was done by treating arrhythmic mice lacking or with mutations to various genes in this feedback loop with MAP dosages. These genes included mutations and deletions to Per1, Per2, Cry1, Cry2, Bmal1, Npas2, CLOCK and CK1e. All of these mutants continued to respond and exhibit changes in free-running rhythms in the presence of MAP, despite mutational breaks in the feedback loop for circadian oscillation. In these arrhythmic animals, regardless of mutation or knockout of critical clock genes, MAP restored rhythm of circadian properties.  This suggests that the molecular mechanism for MASCO is radically different from the known and accepted circadian oscillation model in mammals, and the feedback loop is not necessary for the generation of circadian locomotor rhythmicity by MAP.[21]/nMenaker's lab group at University of Virginia was focused on the organization of circadian systems in vertebrates. The lab is working with a transgenic rat model with Per1 gene linked to a luciferase reporter to track the circadian expression patterns of the Per1 gene in brain and peripheral tissues. They anticipate this data to address if the clocks in all tissues remain in synchrony with a change in light cycle, and the clock-related signals from the brain to peripheral tissues [1]./nMenaker discovered another mutant hamster, this time showing a free-running period of 25 hours in conditions of constant darkness.[22] Menaker's graduate student, Ashli Moore, was a teaching assistant in his colleague's animal behavior course when an undergraduate student insisted on trading in her hamster for one that had a period more closely resembling that of her classmates' hamsters. Menaker bred this mutant hamster with three different females to produce litters with Mendalian ratios of wild-type and heterozygous mutants. He subsequently bred homozygous mutants with a free-running period of 28 hours. Menaker's lab is currently in collaboration with Carla Green's molecular biology lab at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center to study this mutant hamster line further.[22]", "57122799": "Nikos Kyrpides (Greek: \u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03c0\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2) is a Greek-American bioscientist who has worked on the origins of life, information processing, bioinformatics, microbiology, metagenomics and microbiome data science.[1][2][3] He is a senior staff scientist at the Berkeley National Laboratory,[4] head of the Prokaryote Super Program[5] and leads the Microbiome Data Science program[6] at the US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute.[7]/nKyrpides was born in Serres, Greece, where he studied biology at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and received his PhD in molecular biology and biotechnology from the University of Crete. He pursued postdoctoral studies in microbiology with Carl Woese at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and in bioinformatics with Ross Overbeek at the Argonne National Laboratory. From 1999 to 2004 Kyrpides worked in the biotech industry in Chicago, where he led the development of genome analysis and bioinformatics. He joined the United States Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) in 2004 to lead the Genome Biology Program and develop the data management and comparative analysis platforms for microbial genomes and metagenomes. Kyrpides became the Metagenomics Program head in 2010 and founded the Prokaryotic Super Program in 2011, which he still leads with the Microbiome Data Science Group./nKyrpides's early work focused on the origins and evolution of the genetic code. In collaboration with Christos Ouzounis, he developed a series of hypotheses for the transfer of information from proteins to nucleic acids known as reverse interpretation.[8][9][10] With the advent of genomics, Kyrpides turned his interest to the study and understanding of the last universal common ancestor. With Ouzounis he coined the acronym \"LUCA\" at a conference organized by Patrick Forterre at Les Treilles, France, and performed some of the first comparative genome analysis to predict the gene content of the LUCA.[11][12] Kyrpides's work on the information processing systems revealed several previously-unsuspected relationships, suggesting new models for the evolution of those processes. He identified previously-undetected relationships between the eukaryotic and bacterial translation machinery, suggesting that the rudiments of translation initiation would have been present at the universal-ancestor stage.[13][14] Kyrpides's work on the evolution of transcription helped change the understanding of the nature and organization of archaeal transcription machinery, which (at the time) was that transcription in Archaea was strictly similar to that in eukaryotes. Kyrpides and Ouzounis demonstrated the parallel existence of a large number of bacterial-type transcription factors in archaeal genomes.[15][16][17]/nHe led the development of several pioneering data-management systems in microbial genomics and metagenomics, which are widely used in the scientific community (with several thousand users worldwide).[18] These include systems for data management and curation of genome projects and their associated metadata, such as the Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD),[19] and comparative-genomics systems such as ERGO[20] and the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG).[21][22]/nKyrpides's current research focuses on microbiome research, with an emphasis on microbiome data science. This includes the understanding of structure and function of various microorganisms and microbial communities and the elucidation of the evolutionary dynamics shaping the microbial genomes. To accomplish that, his group is developing novel methods for enabling large-scale comparative analysis and mining and visualizing big data. He proposed and published the first study on the use of standard benchmarking data for the evaluation of method accuracy in metagenomics.[23] This approach has become the standard in the field.[24] Some of Kyrpides's recent research in microbiome data science include the exploration of Earth\u2019s virome,[25][26] the identification of new bacterial phyla[27] the prediction of novel folds using metagenomic sequences,[28] and the characterization of new protein families from microbiome data./nKyrpides began the MikroBioKosmos (MBK) initiative in Greece in 2007, with the goal of exploring and commercially using microbial national resources. MikroBioKosmos became a scientific society, with Kyrpides its first president. He is a founding member of two bioinformatics societies in Greece: the Hellenic Society of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (HSCBB) in 2010 and Hellenic Bioinformatics in 2016. Kyrpides is also a board member[29] of the international Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC),[30] which aims to enable genomic data integration, discovery and comparison with international, community-driven standards./nHe began the Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea (GEBA) project at the JGI and the Microbial Earth Project with Hans-Peter Klenk, Philip Hugenholtz and Jonathan Eisen in 2007,[31] with the goal of improving the genome characterization of phylogenetically-diverse cultured microbes.[32] The latter project evolved into an international effort to sequence all the type strains of bacteria and archaea,[33] through a series of GEBA 1,000-genome projects.[34][35][36][37] The rapid growth of microbial genome sequences at the end of 2010, without a parallel venue for describing those projects in a standardized manner, led to the need for a new scientific forum which would be a clearinghouse for capturing and presenting this information to the community. This idea led Kyrpides, George Garrity and Dawn Field to launch a new scientific journal: Standards in Genomic Sciences (SIGS), which became part of BioMed Central.[38][39]/nKyrpides proposed the development of a Microbial Environmental Genomics Administration in 2009, analogous to NASA, for the study and exploration of the most abundant life on the planet.[40] In 2016, following the enormous growth of microbiome data, he outlined the need for a common infrastructure for microbiome data analysis and proposed the development of a National Microbiome Data Center (NMDC), later renamed to National Microbiome Data Collaborative.[41][42] With Emiley Eloe-Fadrosh, Kyrpides organized the first NMDC workshop to launch this initiative at the Joint Genome Institute. This was followed by additional workshops in 2017 hosted by the American Society for Microbiology to promote the initiative.[43]/nKyrpides has received several awards, including the 2018 USFCC/J.

However, his education was interrupted for five years by the Second World War, during which he served in the Royal Air Force. His contribution to development of radar earned him an MBE./nHuxley was the first PhD student of Laboratory of Molecular Biology of the Medical Research Council at Cambridge, where he worked on X-ray diffraction studies on muscle fibres. In the 1950s he was one of the first to use electron microscopy to study biological specimens. During his postdoctoral at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he, with fellow researcher Jean Hanson, discovered the underlying principle of muscle movement, popularised as the sliding filament theory in 1954. After 15 years of research, he proposed the \"swinging cross-bridge hypothesis\" in 1969, which became modern understanding of the molecular basis of muscle contraction, and much of other cellular motility.[7][8]/nHuxley worked at University College London for seven years, and at Laboratory of Molecular Biology for fifteen years, where he was its Deputy Director from 1979. Between 1987 and 1997, he was professor at Brandeis University in Massachusetts, where he spent the rest of his life as emeritus professor./nHuxley studied physics at Christ's College, Cambridge in 1941. During his second year, his education was interrupted by the Second World War, and he joined the Royal Air Force as a radar officer. He worked on the development of radar equipment during 1943 to 1947, for which he was later honoured a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). His expertise in mechanical and electrical devices became useful throughout his scientific career. After completing his service, he returned to Cambridge for his final year, and he received his BA in physics in 1948. The war had completely diminished his interest in physics, particularly on the horrors of atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He therefore joined Cambridge University to become the first PhD student in a newly formed Laboratory of Molecular Biology, then a small Medical Research Council (MRC) unit founded by Max Perutz and John Kendrew, who supervised him. (The LMB was then a small \"hut\" near the famous Cavendish Laboratory.) He was initially given X-ray analysis of proteins, but he turned to muscle. (The protein study was given to the other student Francis Crick, of the eventual DNA fame.) From there he earned his PhD in 1952 in molecular biology. For his thesis titled Investigations in Biological Structures by X-Ray Methods. The Structure of Muscle, he used low-angle, X-ray scattering of live muscle fibers.[9]/nFollowing his PhD, Huxley continued research on the structure and function of muscle. Since Cambridge did not have electron microscopy, which began to be used for biological studies at the time, he went to Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a postdoctoral fellow on a Commonwealth Fellowship in late summer of 1952. He work in F. O. Schmitt's laboratory where he was joined by Jean Hanson in 1953. Their collaboration proved to be fruitful as they discovered the so-called \"sliding filament theory\" of muscle contraction. Their publication in the 22 May 1954 issue of Nature became a landmark in muscle physiology.[10][11] He returned to MRC unit of Cambridge in the late spring of 1954. Using X-ray diffraction he found the molecular interaction in the muscle fibres. The LMB was then equipped with electron microscope, but still had technical issues. Knowing his potential the University College London appointed him to the faculty, and moved there to join Bernard Katz's biophysics department in 1955. For his purpose he was bought a new electron microscope with fund from the Wellcome Trust. His innovative contribution was making a modified version of thin-sectioning microtome, by which he could make histological sections of only 100\u2013150 \u00c5 in thickness. Based on his LMB X-ray diffraction images, the new technique immediately helped him to establish the cross-bridge concept (interaction site of the muscle proteins, myosin and actin).[12] As the MRC unit was enlarged he was invited back in 1962, with a research fellowship at King's College for five years and then a more permanent one at Churchill College. He became the joint Head of the Structural Studies Division of the LMB in 1975, and its Deputy Director in 1979. In 1969, on the basis of his work over more than 15 years, he finally formulated the \"swinging cross-bridge hypothesis\" of muscle contraction,[13]  which is the molecular basis of muscle contraction.[14] The concept itself became directly fundamental to other types of cell motility.[7] In 1987 he joined the biology faculty at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, where he also served as Director of the Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center, and becoming emeritus from 1997 until his death.[15]/nHe was made an MBE in 1948.

Researchers carried out seasonal monitoring of cetaceans using non-invasive DTAGs, developed at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). The tags attach using suction cups which eventually fall off. They record sound and motion and transmit data back to researchers. The objective of this work was to better understand the behavior, social structure and population distribution of beaked whales.[30][34]/nAguilar de Soto's Ph.D. thesis addressed Acoustic and diving behaviour of the short finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus) and Blainville's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris) off the Canary Islands. Implications on the effects of man-made noise and boat collisions (trans., 2006).[17] The combination of recorded whale \"clicks\" and \"buzzes\" with speed, orientation, and depth data from the DTAGs revealed an unsuspected picture of how the whales hunt.  Described in the Journal of Animal Ecology (2008), pilot whales make high-speed dives to pursue large deep-dwelling prey and then return to the surface to breathe and rest.[1][34][11]\nThe amount of energy involved in such sprints is far greater than a minimum cost. This research indicates that marine ecologists must address use of three-dimensional space, prey field distribution and the metabolism of energy expenditure as factors in models of marine foraging.[11]\nAguilar de Soto's research on these \u201ccheetahs of the deep sea\u201d is causing scientists to rethink  their understanding of diving and feeding behaviors. It may influence policies for the management of whale-watching and shipping.[34][10]/nWith the R.V. Cornide de Saavedra, Aguilar de Soto helped to evaluate the effects of a submarine volcanic eruption off El Hierro Island, occurring from 10 October 2011 to 5 March 2012.[35][36]/nAlso in 2012, Aguilar de Soto co-authored an article in Marine Mammal Science discussing the acoustic camouflage of Blainville's beaked whales.   Blainville's beaked whales avoid detection from killer whales by maintaining complete silence during ascents and at less than 170 metres (560\u00a0ft)   below the surface.  Vocalizations consistent with echolocation and communication occur only in the latter part of descents and the deepest phase of dives, in which social group members synchronize their movement.[37]/nWith Andrea Fais and other researchers from multiple international centers, Aguilar de Soto  carried out a complete acoustic sampling of sperm whales, in the deep waters off the Canary Islands.[38] After covering an area of 52,933 square kilometres (20,438\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)  along  2,668 kilometres (1,658\u00a0mi) of acoustic line-transects,[39] the scientists estimated that the current population of sperm whales in Canary waters was around 224 individuals.  They compared that data with strandings involved in collisions with ships.  Data from the CetAVist project between 2012 and 2015 indicated that the Canary Islands is one of the places in the world with the most records of stranding of cetaceans due to collision with ships. In addition, the study highlighted that the mortality of sperm whales due to collisions may exceed the natural growth capacity of the species in the archipelago, leading to a decline in population.\nAs a result of this study, a number of steps were recommended to address this issue. Some recommendations have been implemented, such as the inclusion of relevant information in the training of ship captains who study at the ULL Nautical Engineering School.[38][40][41]/nIn 2017, Aguilar de Soto coauthored a study on the family of beaked whales (Ziphiidae). It includes the first known underwater video recording of living True's beaked whales (Mesoplodon mirus), one of the least known and rarely seen beaked whales in the world.[42][22] The recording was made off the coast of the Azores from a small inflatable boat as part of the Master Mind student program. The teacher and students did not recognize the species or realize that it was a historical first.[16] The presence of True's beaked whales in the footage was later confirmed by Aguilar de Soto.[42]", "61513754": "Marc Tischkowitz is a British medical geneticist.

His conception and co-development of Cre-Lox conditional mutagenesis has provided a means to further perceive the mechanistic underpinnings of disease, and continues to be used by scientists worldwide.[11][12][13][14][15] Prior to the development of conditional mutagenesis, the use of homologous recombination was limited to systemic gene targeting and mutation.[16] Marth's use of Cre-Lox conditional mutagenesis established the presence and functions of multiple and in some cases previously unknown enzymes participating in protein glycosylation, an area of research that has become a focus of exploration of the genetic and metabolic origins of disease.[17][18] Marth also used Cre-Lox mutagenesis to establish a reproducible method for obtaining animal models of essential X chromosome-linked genes.[19]/nMarth's early studies of glycosylation and glycan linkages revealed a profound effect on immunity and contributed to the genesis of the related sub-field termed glycoimmunology.[17][20][21] Marth's laboratory discovered connections between aberrant glycan linkages and autoimmune diseases including the fact that the exposure of cryptic immature glycan linkages in mammals could initiate chronic sterile inflammation leading to the development of autoimmunity.[5][18] Those findings indicated that autoimmunity can be precipitated by the presence of abnormal glycan structures within the body.[20][22]/nMarth's laboratory has also taken a close look at the molecular and cellular bases of Type 2 diabetes and the role that protein glycosylation plays in the origin of the disease.[23][24] Their research demonstrated that acquired pancreatic beta cell  dysfunction was the major contributor of disease onset and corroborated views that genetic variation was unlikely to be the primary cause of obesity-associated Type 2 diabetes in humans.[23][25] Instead, their findings revealed that altered pancreatic beta cell glycosylation resulting from elevated fatty acid levels in obesity disabled glucose sensing, resulting in hyperglycemia with glucose intolerance.[2][26] Marth's research team further found that this pathway was induced in human patients with Type 2 diabetes and was responsible for a significant amount of the insulin resistance present in experimentally-induced obesity-associated diabetes.[2][27]/nThe pathological underpinnings of inflammatory diseases including sepsis have also been the subject of research by Marth's laboratory.[3][5][28] Marth and colleagues discovered the first physiological purpose of the Ashwell-Morell Receptor (AMR), a hepatocyte lectin discovered by Gilbert Ashwell and Anatol Morell.[18][29] Marth's studies revealed the presence of an intrinsic mechanism of secreted protein aging and turnover first proposed by Ashwell and Morell in the 1960s, and which participates in controlling the half-lives and functions of secreted and cell surface glycoproteins.[18][30] Their studies further identified how AMR function can be modulated for therapeutic purposes.[3]/nIn 2008, Marth published an initial enumeration of the building blocks of life, all of which fall under the four types of cellular macromolecules (glycans, lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins).[31][32] This accounting has become an educational feature of cell biology texts.

He is the author of Evolution of Infectious Disease (1994) and Plague Time: The New Germ Theory of Disease (2002), and is currently director of the program in Evolutionary Medicine at the Biology Department of the University of Louisville./nEwald is known for his \"theory of virulence\u201d, suggesting that \"the deadlier the germ, the less likely it is to spread\",[1] and his theory that many common diseases of unknown origin are likely the result of chronic low-level infections from viruses, bacteria or protozoa./nEwald received his BSc in 1975 from the University of California, Irvine, in biological sciences and his PhD in 1980 from the University of Washington, in zoology, with specialization in ecology and evolution.[2] He was formerly a professor of biology at Amherst College, and is currently director of the program in evolutionary medicine in the Biology Department of the University of Louisville.[3]/nEwald asserts, along with a growing body of studies, that many common diseases of unknown origin are likely the result of chronic low-level infections from viruses, bacteria or protozoa.[4] For example, cervical cancer can be caused by the human papilloma virus,[5] some cases of liver cancer are caused by hepatitis C or B[6] and the bacteria Helicobacter pylori has been proven to cause stomach ulcers.[7] Ewald argues that many common diseases of currently unknown etiology, such as cancers, heart attacks, stroke and Alzheimer's, may likewise be also caused by chronic low-level microbial infection.[8]/nEwald disagrees with the popular theory that genes alone dictate chronic disease susceptibility. Ewald, whose background is in evolutionary biology, points out that any disease causing gene that reduces survival and reproduction would normally eliminate itself over a number of generations. Ewald says that \"chronic diseases, if they are common and damaging, must be powerful eliminators of any genetic instruction that may cause them.\"[9] One example of this is schizophrenia; patients with this mental illness rarely reproduce. Ewald argues that, just by evolutionary pressures, schizophrenia would have already been eliminated if its causes were strictly genetic; he suggests that in the future, an infectious cause of schizophrenia will be discovered.[10]/nEwald explains that purely genetic causes of chronic disease will persist only if a genetic instruction provides a compensating benefit (for example, the disease sickle cell anemia is caused by a genetic mutation that, in heterozygotes, protects against malaria, which kills millions worldwide each year).[9]/nFurther evidence for a non-genetic etiology of diseases like schizophrenia, Ewald also points out, comes from concordance studies on identical twins, which measure the percentage of identical twins who both develop a disease. A concordance of 100% indicates a primarily genetic disease, which is not really influenced by environmental factors like infection, nutrition, or toxins. Huntington's disease, for example, has a concordance rate of 100%, indicating a predominately genetic etiology. However, when the concordance rate is lower, this indicates environmental factors like infectious microbes or toxin exposure are playing a causal role. Schizophrenia's concordance is approximately 35-60%, suggesting, says Ewald, that microbes are etiologically involved.[2] Another example is breast cancer: Ewald notes that in the case of identical twins, when one twin develops breast cancer, the other twin has only a 10% to 20% chance of developing the disease, and this concordance rate of just 20% again indicates that environmental factors like infectious microbes or toxins are likely playing large causal roles in breast cancer./nEwald's curiosity regarding the evolutionary process of infections was sparked by a bad case of diarrhea he had in 1977.[11] His first thought during this bout was that his body was using diarrhea to expel the pathogen and he should avoid anti-diarrheal medication. Looking at the problem from the standpoint of the organism, expulsion was not an evolutionary benefit. The only benefit to the pathogen causing the sickness would be the potential transmission to other hosts; much like the particulate expelled during coughing, diarrhea can be a means of distribution. Another major influence on Ewald's thinking in evolutionary biology terms was the HIV virus, which once caught, initially remains inactive for years thus allowing it to spread, before the chronic disease of AIDS finally manifests, incapacitates, and eventually kills the host.[12]/nIn 2010, Utne Reader magazine named Ewald as one of the \"25 Visionaries Who Are Changing Your World\" for his research on the link between infections and cancers.[13]", "23994464": "Diane Edmund Griffin (born May 5, 1940)[1] is the university distinguished professor and a professor in the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, where she was the department chair from 1994-2015.

The S&S has been implemented in many gene-finding and mutation detection tools  that are used extensively in major clinical and research institutions around the world for uncovering mutations in thousands of patients with numerous diseases, including cancers and inherited disorders.[8][9][10][11][12] It is increasingly used in the Next Generation Sequencing era, as it is widely realized that >50% of all diseases and adverse drug reactions in humans and other animals possibly occur within the splicing regions of genes.[13][14][15][16][17][18][19] The S&S algorithm has been cited in ~4,000 publications on finding splicing mutations in thousands of cancer and inherited disorders./nDr. Senapathy offered a new hypothesis on the origin of introns, split genes and splice junctions in eukaryotic genes. As the split structure of genes is central to eukaryotic biology, their origin has been a major question in biology. Dr. Senapathy proposed the \"split gene theory,\" which states that the split structure arose due to the origin of split genes from random DNA sequences, and provided tangible evidence from genome sequences of several organisms.[1][2][4][5]  He also showed that the splice junctions of eukaryotic genes could have originated from the stop codon ends of the Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in random DNA sequences based on analysis of eukaryotic genomic DNA sequences. Dr. Marshall Nirenberg, the Nobel Laureate who had deciphered codons, communicated the papers to the PNAS.[1][2] Senapathy has published his other scientific findings in journals including Science, Nucleic Acids Research, PNAS, Journal of Biological Chemistry, and Journal of Molecular Biology, and is the author of several patents in the genomics field./nSenapathy has a Ph.D. in molecular biology from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India.

Dr. Senapathy founded Genome International in 1992 for developing computational biology research, products and services/nDr. Senapathy has provided major contributions in RNA splicing biology, impacting the understanding of the structure, function, and origin of the eukaryotic exons, introns, splice junctions, and split genes, and the applications of these findings in human medicine that has positively affected thousands of patients with hundreds of diseases including cancers and inherited disorders. His research is an example of the application of basic molecular biology research findings to human medicine with profound impact, and a variety of basic science and other practical applications in animals and plants./nThe split gene theory answers major questions of why and how the split genes of eukaryotes originated. It states that if coding sequences for biological proteins originated from random primordial genetic sequences, the random occurrence of the 3 stop codons out of 64 codons would limit the open reading frames (ORFs) to a very short length of ~60 bases. Thus, coding sequences for biological proteins with average lengths of ~1,200 bases, and long coding sequences of 6,000 bases, can practically never occur in random sequences. Thus, genes had to occur in pieces in a split form, with short coding sequences (ORFs) that became exons, interrupted by very long random sequences that became introns. When the eukaryotic DNA was tested for ORF length distribution, it exactly matched that from random DNA, with very short ORFs that matched the lengths of exons, and very long introns as predicted, supporting the split gene theory.[1][2]  Thus, introns are relics left over from their random sequence origin, and thus are earmarked to be removed at the primary RNA stage, although incidentally they may have few genetic elements useful to the cell. The Nobel Laureate Dr. Marshall Nirenberg, who deciphered the codons, communicated the paper to the PNAS.[1] New Scientist covered this publication titled \"A long explanation for introns\".[20]/nNoted molecular biologist and biophysicist Dr. Colin Blake from the Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics and Oxford Centre for Molecular Sciences, University of Oxford, commented on Dr. Senapathy's theory that:[21] \"Recent work by Dr. Senapathy, when applied to RNA, comprehensively explains the origin of the segregated form of RNA into coding and non-coding regions. It also suggests why a splicing mechanism was developed at the start of primordial evolution. The presence of random sequence was therefore sufficient to create in the primordial ancestor the segregated form of RNA observed in the eukaryotic gene structure.\"/nDr. Senapathy's research also elucidates the origin of the splice junctions of eukaryotic genes, again the major questions of why and how the splice junction signals originated. Dr. Senapathy predicted that, if the split gene theory was true, the ends of these ORFs that had a stop codon would have become the ends of exons that would occur within introns, and that would define the splice junctions. Senapathy found that almost all splice junctions in eukaryotic genes contained stop codons exactly at the ends of introns, bordering the exons as predicted.[2] In fact, these stop codons were found to form the \"canonical\" AG:GT splicing sequence, with the three stop codons occurring as part of the strong consensus signals. Senapathy had observed that mutations in these stop codon bases within splice junctions were the cause of the majority of diseases caused by splicing mutations, emphasizing the importance of stop codons in the splice junctions. Thus, the basic split gene theory led to the hypothesis that the splice junctions originated from the stop codons.[2] Dr. Marshall Nirenberg supported the publication of this paper in the PNAS. New Scientist covered this publication titled \"Exons, Introns and Evolution\".[22]/nResearch based on the split gene theory sheds lights on other basic questions of exons and introns. The exons of eukaryotes are generally short (human exons average ~120 bases, and can be as short as 10 bases) and introns are usually very long (average of ~3,000 bases,  and can be several hundred thousands bases long), for example genes RBFOX1, CNTNAP2, PTPRD and DLG2. Dr. Senapathy has provided a plausible answer to these questions, which has remained the only explanation so far. Based on the split gene theory, exons of eukaryotic genes, if they originated from random DNA sequences, have to match the lengths of ORFs from random sequence, and possibly should be around 100 bases (close to the median length of ORFs in random sequence). The genome sequences of living organisms, for example the human, exhibits exactly the same average lengths of 120 bases for exons, and the longest exons of 600 bases (with few exceptions), which is the same length as that of the longest random ORFs. In addition, the introns can be very long, based on the split gene theory, which is found to be true in eukaryotic organisms./nThis work also explains why the genomes are very large, for example, the human genome with three billion bases, and why only a very small fraction of the human genome (~2%) codes for the proteins and other regulatory elements.[23][24]  If split genes originated from random primordial DNA sequences, it would contain a significant amount of DNA that would be represented by introns. Furthermore, a genome assembled from random DNA containing split genes would also include intergenic random DNA. Thus, the nascent genomes that originated from random DNA sequences had to be large, regardless of the complexity of the organism. The observation that the genomes of several organisms such as that of the onion (~16 billion bases [25]) and salamander (~32 billion bases [26]) are much larger than that of the human (~3 billion bases[23][24] ) but the organisms are no more complex than human provides credence to this split gene theory. Furthermore, the findings that the genomes of several organisms are smaller, although they contain essentially the same number of genes as that of the human, such as those of the C. elegans (genome size ~100 million bases, ~19,000 genes)[27] and Arabidopsis (genome size ~125 million bases, ~25,000 genes),[28] adds support to this theory. The split gene theory predicts that the introns in the split genes in these genomes could be the \"reduced\" (or deleted) form compared to the larger genes with long introns, thus leading to reduced genomes.[1][4] In fact, researchers have recently proposed that these smaller genomes are actually reduced genomes, which adds support to the split gene theory.[29]/nDr. Senapathy's research also addresses the origin of the spliceosomal machinery that edits out the introns from the RNA transcripts of genes. If the split genes had originated from random DNA, then the introns would have become an unnecessary but integral part of the eukaryotic genes along with the splice junctions at their ends. The spliceosomal machinery would be required to remove them and to enable the short exons to be linearly spliced together as a contiguously coding mRNA that can be translated into a complete protein. Thus, the split gene theory shows that the whole spliceosomal machinery originated due to the origin of split genes from random DNA sequences, and to remove the unnecessary introns.[1][2]/nDr. Senapathy had also proposed a plausible mechanistic and functional rationale why the eukaryotic nucleus originated, a major unanswered question in biology.[1][2]  If the transcripts of the split genes and the spliced mRNAs were present in a cell without a nucleus, the ribosomes would try to bind to both the un-spliced primary RNA transcript and the spliced mRNA, which would result in a molecular chaos. If a boundary had originated to separate the RNA splicing process from the mRNA translation, it can avoid this problem of molecular chaos. This is exactly what is found in eukaryotic cells, where the splicing of the primary RNA transcript occurs within the nucleus, and the spliced mRNA is transported to the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes translate them into proteins. The nuclear boundary provides a clear separation of the primary RNA splicing and the mRNA translation./nThese investigations thus led to the possibility that primordial DNA with essentially random sequence gave rise to the complex structure of the split genes with exons, introns and splice junctions. They also predict that the cells that harbored these split genes had to be complex with a nuclear cytoplasmic boundary, and must have had a spliceosomal machinery. Thus, it was possible that the earliest cell was complex and eukaryotic.[1][2][4][5] Surprisingly, findings from extensive comparative genomics research from several organisms over the past 15 years are showing overwhelmingly that the earliest organisms could have been highly complex and eukaryotic, and could have contained complex proteins,[30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37] exactly as predicted by Senapathy's theory./nThe spliceosome is a highly complex machinery within the eukaryotic cell, containing ~200 proteins and several SnRNPs. In their paper [34] \"Complex spliceosomal organization ancestral to extant eukaryotes,\" molecular biologists Dr. Lesley Collins and Dr. David Penny state \"We begin with the hypothesis that ... the spliceosome has increased in complexity throughout eukaryotic evolution. However, examination of the distribution of spliceosomal components indicates that not only was a spliceosome present in the eukaryotic ancestor but it also contained most of the key components found in today's eukaryotes. ... the last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes appears to show much of the molecular complexity seen today.\" This suggests that the earliest eukaryotic organisms were highly complex and contained sophisticated genes and proteins, as the split gene theory predicts./nThe split gene theory culminated in the Shapiro-Senapathy algorithm, which aids in the identification of splicing mutations that cause numerous diseases and adverse drug reactions.[3][7] This algorithm is increasingly used in clinical practice and research not only to find mutations in known disease-causing genes in patients, but also to discover novel genes that are causal of different diseases. In addition, it is employed in finding the mechanism of aberrant splicing in individual patients as well as cohorts of patients with a particular disease. Furthermore, it is used in defining the cryptic splice sites and deducing the mechanisms by which mutations in them can affect normal splicing and lead to different diseases. It is also employed in addressing various questions in basic research in humans, animals and plants./nThese contributions have impacted major questions in eukaryotic biology and their applications to human medicine. These applications may expand as the fields of clinical genomics and pharmacogenomics magnify their research with mega sequencing projects such as the All of Us project that will sequence a million individuals, and with the sequencing of millions of patients in clinical practice and research in the future.", "70459523": "Manuel \u00c1lvarez-Ur\u00eda Rico-Villademoros is a Spanish cell biologist who held the presidency of the Royal Academy of Medicine of the Principality of Asturias (Spain) for more than a decade until 2015.

On hearing of the British attack on Copenhagen in 1807, Fabricius returned to Kiel, damaging his already fragile health. He died on 3 March 1808, at the age of 63.[3] His daughter died in an accident in Paris, but he was survived by two sons, who both studied medicine.[2]/nThe evolutionary ideas of Fabricius are not well known. He believed that man originated from the great apes and that new species could be formed by the hybridization of existing species.[6] He also has been called the \"Father of Lamarckism\" because of his belief that new species could form from morphological adaptation.[6][7] Fabricius wrote about the influence of environment on development of species and selection phenomena (females preferring the strongest males).[6][8]/nFabricius is considered one of the greatest entomologists of the 18th century.[3] He was a greater observer of insects than his more botanically-minded mentor, Carl Linnaeus. Fabricius named 9,776 species of insects, compared to Linnaeus' tally of around 3,000.[8]  He identified many species of Tenebrionidae from the Egyptian Sinai on the basis of other entomologists' collections.[9]/nFabricius added two distinct areas to the classification system.  He considers both artificial and natural characteristics. Artificial characteristics allow for the determination of a species, and natural ones allow for the relationship to other genera and varieties.[8]/nIn contrast to Linnaeus' classification of the insects, which was based primarily on the number of wings, and their form, Fabricius used the form of the mouthparts to discriminate the orders (which he termed \"classes\").[8] He stated \"those whose nourishment and biology are the same, must then belong to the same genus.\"[10] Fabricius' system remains the basis of insect classification today, although the names he proposed are not. For instance, his name for the order containing the beetles was \"Eleutherata\", rather than the modern \"Coleoptera\", and he used \"Piezata\" for Hymenoptera; his term Glossata is still in use, but for a slightly smaller group among the Lepidoptera, rather than the whole order. Fabricius also foresaw that the male genitalia would provide useful characters for systematics, but could not apply that insight himself.[10]/nFabricius was the first to divide the Staphylinidae (rove beetles), which Linnaeus had considered a single genus that he called \"Staphylinus\", establishing in 1775 the genus Paederus.

In 2018 she became Chair of the Department of Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School.[1]  She is known for discovering the pulsatile behavior of the tumor suppressor protein p53[2] and uncovering its significance for cell fate,[3][4] and for her contributions to the culture of mentoring in science.[5][6] She lives in Boston, Massachusetts./nLahav earned her PhD in 2001 from the Technion, where she studied transcriptional regulation in the laboratory of Yona Kassir. She then performed postdoctoral work in the laboratory of Uri Alon at the Weizmann Institute of Science./nIn her postdoctoral work in the Alon lab, Lahav investigated the response of p53 to DNA damage. p53 is highly studied due to its role as \"guardian of the genome\";[7] in response to DNA damage, p53 activation may lead to a delay in the cell cycle to allow DNA repair, or may cause the cell to undergo senescence or apoptosis. Previous work had shown that the feedback loop between p53 and its regulator Mdm2 could theoretically cause oscillations in the level of p53.[8] Oscillations were in fact observed in cells exposed to radiation, using a Western blot technique that measures the average p53 level in a population of cells.[8] Lahav developed a novel system for following p53 levels and Mdm2 levels simultaneously in individual living cells[2] and demonstrated that individual cells show discrete pulses of p53 after gamma irradiation. Genetically identical cells showed different numbers of pulses: 0, 1, 2 or more.  Although the size of the pulse does not change with increasing levels of DNA damage, the average number of pulses does increase.[2]  In later work, Lahav showed that these pulses are not an autonomous oscillation intrinsic to the p53:Mdm2 feedback loop, but are recurrently initiated by upstream signals of continuing DNA damage.[9] This finding suggests that p53 may measure the intensity of some signals in a digital manner (number of pulses), not in an analog manner (higher concentrations of p53).[10]/nLahav then discovered that DNA damage caused by UV-irradiation results in a different p53 behavior, leading to a single pulse that increases in size and duration with increasing damage.[11] This led her to hypothesize that the dynamic behavior of p53 contained information on the nature of the damage to DNA and determined the nature of the response by the damaged cell. She developed a method for forcing a cell damaged by gamma irradiation to adopt the p53 dynamics seen in UV irradiation, based on precisely timed additions of the Mdm2 inhibitor Nutlin-3. Cells damaged using gamma irradiation without drug treatment showed cell cycle arrest and then recovered, while the same cells treated with drug to simulate UV-type p53 dynamics entered senescence and failed to divide.[4] These results led Lahav to investigate whether the schedule of drug administration might affect the response to common types of combination therapy in cancer, in which drugs are given in combination with radiation therapy.  She found that if radiation was given shortly after addition of an Mdm2 inhibitor the treatment enhanced the effect of radiation, whereas a longer gap between the two treatments led to resistance.[12][13] There is growing consensus that dynamics are important for signaling in multiple biological pathways.[14]/nLahav has measured the cell-to-cell variation in p53 response in colon cancer cells responding to damage by the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin[15] and has argued that this variation may underlie the phenomenon of fractional kill, in which a fraction of cancer cells survive chemotherapeutic treatment and subsequently grow, causing a recurrence of the cancer./nLahav joined the Department of Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School in 2004.

He was a member of the Polish resistance movement and the Armia Krajowa, and he fought during the Warsaw Uprising. According to his own account,[1] he became interested with genetics when he discovered, among ruins of a German police station and while performing an act of sabotage, a German book on the experiments of George Wells Beadle and Boris Ephrussi./nAfter the war, he finished medical studies at the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w. In 1947, S\u0142onimski emigrated and settled in France, as members of Armia Krajowa were prosecuted by the newly established communist government in Poland. Once in Paris, he joined the group of Boris Ephrussi at Sorbonne University and started working in the field of genetics. In 1952 he obtained his Ph.D./nBetween 1971 and 1991, S\u0142onimski was the director of Centre de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique Mol\u00e9culaire of the French CNRS in Gif-sur-Yvette./nS\u0142onimski never broke the contacts with his home country, Poland. Since 1980, he was heading the Solidarit\u00e9 France-Pologne, organizing aid for Poland.[2] He frequently hosted Polish intelectualists and dissidents, such as Adam Michnik, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Maria and Leszek Ko\u0142akowski. When martial law was introduced in Poland in 1981, he organized financial support for scientists repressed by the government.[3] The money was smuggled and distributed in Poland by two Polish couriers: Wac\u0142aw Gajewski, a professor of genetics, and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kunicki-Goldfinger, a professor of microbiology.[3] S\u0142onimski gave them the code names \"Eukaryote\" and \"Prokaryote\", as Gajewski was working on fungi, and Kunicki-Goldfinger was a microbiologist./nPiotr S\u0142onimski did pioneering work on yeast mitochondrial genetics.[1] He was one of the first to show that genetic information is passed outside of the nucleus in mitochondria,[4] and his subsequent, much cited work led to establishment of the field of mitochondrial genomics. In 1980, he discovered that some parts of the introns in yeast mitochondria encode an enzyme\u2014which he called a maturase\u2014that aids the splicing and the maturation of mRNA.[5]", "41787575": "Haruko Obokata (\u5c0f\u4fdd\u65b9 \u6674\u5b50, Obokata Haruko, born 1983) is a former stem-cell biologist and research unit leader at Japan's Laboratory for Cellular Reprogramming, Riken Center for Developmental Biology. She claimed in 2014 to have developed a radical and remarkably easy way to generate stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency (STAP) cells that could be grown into tissue for use anywhere in the body. In response to allegations of irregularities in Obokata's research publications involving STAP cells, Riken launched an investigation that discovered examples of scientific misconduct on the part of Obokata. Attempts to replicate Obokata's STAP cell results failed. The ensuing STAP cell scandal gained worldwide attention./nObokata was born in Matsudo, Chiba, Japan, in 1983. She attended Toho Senior High School, which is attached to Toho University, and graduated from Waseda University with a B.S. degree in 2006, and an M.S. degree in applied chemistry in 2008. Obokata later joined the laboratory of Charles Vacanti at Harvard Medical School, where she was described as \"a lab director\u2019s dream\" with \"fanatical devotion\".[3] In 2011, Obokata completed her Ph.D. in Engineering at the Graduate School of Advanced Engineering and Science at Waseda University.[4][5] Obokata became a guest researcher at the Riken Center for Developmental Biology in 2011, and in 2013 became head of the Lab for Cellular Reprogramming.[6][7][8]/nAccording to an Asahi Shimbun news report, Obokata offered to retract her doctoral dissertation following allegations that she plagiarized  segments of her dissertation from publicly available documents from the U.S. National Institute of Health website.[9] In October 2014, an investigative panel appointed by Waseda University gave Obokata one year to revise her dissertation or lose her degree.[10] In 2015, Waseda University announced that it was revoking Obokata's doctoral degree.[11]/nAt Riken, Obokata studied stem cells in collaboration with Vacanti, Teruhiko Wakayama, and Yoshiki Sasai, with two of her research papers accepted for publication in Nature in 2013.[12][13][14][15] In a note to Vacanti, Sasai wrote that Obokata had discovered \"a magic spell\" that led to their experimental success,[16] described later in The Guardian as \"a surprisingly simple way of turning ordinary body cells\u2026into something very much like embryonic stem cells\" by soaking them in \"a weak bath of citric acid.\" This procedure was reported to \"wash away [the cells'] developmental past,\" transforming them into \"cellular infants, able to multiply abundantly and grow into any type of cell in the body, a superpower known as pluripotency.\" Upon publication of the papers, Obokata \"was hailed as a bright new star in the scientific firmament and a national hero.\"[17]/nWithin days of publication of the Nature articles, \"disturbing allegations emerged [...] images looked doctored, and chunks of [...] text were lifted from other papers.\"[18] Critics noted that images in the published articles were similar to those published in Obokata's doctoral thesis, the latter involving different experiments than those presented in the Nature publications.[19]/nIn 2014 Riken launched an investigation into the issue,[20] and announced on April 1 that Obokata was guilty of scientific misconduct on two of the six charges initially brought against her.[21] The Riken investigation document reported:/nIn manipulating the image data of two different gels and using data from two different experiments, Dr. Obokata acted in a manner that can by no means be permitted. This cannot be explained solely by her immaturity as a researcher. Given the poor quality of her laboratory notes it has become clearly evident that it will be extremely difficult for anyone else to accurately trace or understand her experiments, and this, too, is considered a serious obstacle to healthy information exchange. Dr. Obokata\u2019s actions and sloppy data management lead us to the conclusion that she sorely lacks, not only a sense of research ethics, but also integrity and humility as a scientific researcher.[22][23]/nObokata apologised for her \"insufficient efforts, ill-preparedness and unskillfulness\", and claimed she had only made \"benevolent mistakes\"; she denied the charge that she had fabricated results, and denied that she lacked ethics, integrity, and humility. Obokata also reported that her STAP cells existed. The Guardian reported that although Obokata's collaborators initially supported her, \"one by one they relented and asked Nature to retract the articles.\"[24] In June 2014, Obokata agreed to retract both papers.[25][26][27][28]/nNear the time of retraction, \"genetic analysis showed that the Stap cells didn\u2019t match the mice from which they supposedly came.\" Although Obokata claimed not to know how this was possible, \"the obvious, and rather depressing, explanation is that her so-called Stap cells were just regular embryonic stem cells that someone had taken from a freezer and relabelled.\"[29] In July 2014, Obokata participated, with monitoring by a third party, in Riken's effort to experimentally reproduce the original STAP cell findings. Those efforts failed to replicate the results originally reported.[30]/nAlthough cleared of misconduct, Sasai was criticized for inadequate supervision of Obokata, and he described himself as \"overwhelmed with shame\".[31] After spending a month in hospital, Sasai took his own life on August 5, 2014.[32][33]/nObokata resigned from Riken in December 2014.[34][35]/nIn a February 2015 article, The Guardian reported that Obokata was guilty of \"unbelievable carelessness\", having \"manipulated images and plagiarised text.\" Obokata was also described as exhibiting hubris: \"If Obokata hadn\u2019t tried to be a world-beater, chances are her sleights of hand would have gone unnoticed and she would still be looking forward to a long and happy career in science. [...] By stepping into the limelight, she exposed her work to greater scrutiny than it could bear.\"[36]/nIn 2016, Obokata's book Ano hi (\u3042\u306e\u65e5- That Day) was published by Kodansha. In her account of the controversy, Obokata relates her association with Wakayama, writing that \"crucial parts of the STAP experiments were handled only by Wakayama\", that she received the STAP cells from Wakayama, and that Wakayama \"changed his accounts of how the STAP cells were produced.\"[37] Obokata later wrote \"I feel a strong sense of responsibility for the STAP papers [...], \"I never wrote those papers to deceive anyone,\" and \"STAP was real.\"[38]/nA short essay by Obokata appeared in the May 17, 2018, issue of Shukan Bunshun magazine, in which she described herself as \"a person who has been hounded\".[39]", "50012346": "Vijaya Lakshmi Melnick  (born 19 November 1937)[1] is an India-born American academic specializing in biological and environmental sciences and immunology.

After being privately tutored, he went to King's College London. He was the author of A Manual of British Butterflies and Moths[2] (1857\u201359) and with the German entomologist Philipp Christoph Zeller, a Swiss, Heinrich Frey and another Englishman, John William Douglas of The Natural History of the Tineina (1855\u201373). He undertook editing William Buckler's and John Hellins' work, following their deaths: The Larvae of the British Butterflies and Moths.[3] He was also a prolific editor of entomological periodicals, including the Entomologist's Weekly Intelligencer (1856\u201361) and the Entomologist's Monthly Magazine (1864 until his death \u2013 the magazine continues to be published).[4]/nStainton was a very wealthy man and his house in Lewisham, \"Mountsfield\", was one of London's more substantial residences set in its own park. Other wealthy entomologists often stayed at Mountsfield when visiting London, notably Alexander Henry Haliday and Deiterich Carl August Dohrn. The zoologist Nicholas Aylward Vigors was a close friend. Such people, sought by the growing number of scientific societies, wielded enormous influence on scientific development.  Stainton was a regular visitor to both Haliday's house in Lucca and to Dohrn's in Stettin. He was a member of both the Entomological Society of London and the Stettin Entomological Society. Besides this, from 1856, he encouraged interest in entomology among the wider public by holding weekly 'open evenings' at his house. Anyone over the age of 14 could freely visit Mountsfield on such evenings, perhaps to have a specimen identified; to view his collection; use his library; or simply to learn more about entomology from Stainton himself, or other guests who may have been present. The home of his family no longer stands but a Stainton road runs beside Mountsfield Park.[5]", "15835350": "Jeffrey Ivan Gordon[1] (born c. 1947) is a biologist and the Dr. Robert J. Glaser Distinguished University Professor and Director of the Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology at Washington University in St. Louis.[2]  He is internationally known for his research on gastrointestinal development and how gut microbial communities affect normal intestinal function, shape various aspects of human physiology including our nutritional status, and affect predisposition to  diseases.[3]  He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, and the American Philosophical Society.[4]/nGordon received his bachelor's degree in Biology at 1969 at Oberlin College in Ohio. Over the next four years, Gordon received his medical training at the University of Chicago and graduated with honors in 1973.   After two years as intern and junior assistant resident in Medicine at Barnes Hospital, St Louis, Gordon joined the Laboratory of Biochemistry at the National Cancer Institute as a Research Associate in 1975.  He returned to Barnes Hospital in 1978 to become Senior Assistant Resident and then Chief Medical Resident at Washington University Medical Service. In 1981 he completed a fellowship in medicine (Gastroenterology) at Washington University School of Medicine.  In the following years, Gordon rose quickly through the academic ranks at Washington University: Asst. Prof. (1981\u20131984); Assoc. Prof. (1985\u20131987); Prof. (1987\u20131991) of Medicine and Biological Chemistry. In 1991, he became head of the Dept. Molecular Biology & Pharmacology (1991\u20132004). Gordon is currently the Director of the Center for Genome Sciences (2004\u2013present) at Washington University in St. Louis./nGordon's early career focused on the development of cell lineages within the gastrointestinal tract.  His laboratory initially combined the use of transgenic mouse models and biochemical approaches to elucidate the mechanisms of gut epithelial development along the duodenal-colonic and crypt-villus axes.  Early studies also provided important insight into biochemical properties of lipid handling and transport in the digestive system. Dr. Gordon and colleagues later combined laser capture microdissection, and functional genomics to characterize specified cell populations within the gastrointestinal tract, including multipotent stem cells./nGordon played a pivotal role in the study of protein N-myristoylation, a co-translational modification by which a myristoyl group is covalently attached to an N-terminal glycine residue of a nascent polypeptide. Gordon and his colleagues were instrumental in characterizing the mechanism by which N-myristoyltransferase (the enzyme that catalyzes the myristoylation reaction) selects its substrates and its catalytic mechanism.[5]/nGordon's group published a series of elegant studies that describe the ability of components of the commensal microbiota to induce specific responses in the host intestinal epithelium.   One of these responses, the induction of intestinal cell surface fucose residues, is elicited by a prominent human intestinal symbiont, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, which can harvest and use the host fucose as a carbon and energy source.[6] Gordon's group published a seminal study in which functional genomics were used to document the genome-wide intestinal epithelial response to microbial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract.[7] Dr. Gordon's laboratory has investigated epithelial cell interaction with human-associated pathogens, including uropathogenic Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori, and Listeria monocytogenes./nGordon and his laboratory are currently focused on understanding the mutualistic interactions that occur between humans and the 10\u2013100 trillion commensal microbes that colonize each person's gastrointestinal tract.   To tease apart the complex relationships that exist within this gut microbiota, Dr. Gordon's research program employs germ-free and gnotobiotic mice as model hosts, which may be colonized with defined, simplified microbial communities. These model intestinal microbiotas are more amenable to well-controlled experimentation./nGordon has become an international pioneer in the study of gut microbial ecology and evolution, using innovative methods to interpret metagenomic and gut microbial genomic sequencing data.  In recent studies, Dr. Gordon's lab has established that the gut microbiota plays a role in host fat storage and obesity.[8] Gordon and co-workers have used DNA pyrosequencing technology to perform metagenomics on the intestinal contents of obese mice, demonstrating that the gut microbiota of fat mice possess an enhanced capacity for aiding the host in harvesting energy from the diet.[9] A study of the microbial ecology of obese human subjects on two different weight loss diets indicate that the same principles may be operating in humans.[10] His group has applied the sequencing of bacterial and archaeal genomes to describe the microbial functional genomic and metabolomic underpinnings of microbial adaptation to the gastrointestinal habitat.[11][12] This approach has been extended to describe the role of the adaptive immune system in maintaining the host-microbial relationship.[13]/nGordon is the lead author of an influential 2005 National Human Genome Research Institute white-paper entitled \u201cExtending Our View of Self: the Human Gut Microbiome Initiative (HGMI)\u201d.

The other notable systems biologist at time was Henrik Kacser at the University of Edinburgh. Given that his early work had a significant mathematical and computational component, he was ideally positioned to consider a more quantitative approach to studying the properties of cellular networks. It was against this background that he turned to the relatively new field called metabolic control analysis as a means to understand the principles of metabolic regulation. Before the development of metabolic control analysis, understanding metabolism was based on qualitative arguments which resulted in some incorrect conclusions (rate-limiting steps). Much of Fell's research for the next 20 years focussed on extending and applying metabolic control analysis to metabolism. This work culminated in the publication of his textbook, Understanding the control of metabolism.[3] In 1986 he published with his graduate student Rankin Small, one of the earliest flux-balance models where they used linear programming to examine the efficiency in the conversion of glucose into fat.[9] He was also one of the first researchers to use the Gillespie method for stochastic simulation in cellular biology,[10] a method that is now routinely used in systems biology.  In the late 1990s his research started shifting more towards stoichiometric analysis with particular emphasis on elementary modes[11] and the analysis of larger networks such as those involved in photosynthesis[12] and whole genome scale models in a variety of organisms including one of the first genome scale models of Arabidopsis.[13]/nOther than his textbook, which has been cited 1464 times (Sept, 2018), his top ten publications include:[14] two publications related to the evolutionary age of metabolism using small-world analysis, the definition of a pathway in terms of elementary modes, three reviews on metabolic control analysis including a republication[15] of the seminal work, Control of Flux by Kacser and Burns,[16] two research papers on metabolic control analysis,  one of the earliest papers on the use of flux-balance analysis, one of the earliest papers that describes a model the MAPK pathway in EGF signalling, and well as the earliest paper that describes the whole genome-scale model of the plant Arabidopsis.", "70459613": "Katrina Ray is a biologist and the chief editor of Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology./nRay has a bachelor's degree in microbiology from the University of Manchester and a PhD from Imperial College London where she studied Shigella flexneri.[1]/nRay has worked at the Institut Pasteur, the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, and the Karolinska Institutet.[1] She started working at Nature Reviews in 2010 and has worked in Nature Reviews Rheumatology and also Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology where she became the chief editor in 2014.[1]/nHer research focusses on gastroenterology, infection, microbiota, neurogastroenterology, and viral hepatitis.[1][2] She has advocated for people to consider gut microbes as a \"human microbial organ.\"[3]/nRay lives in London, England.[1]", "54796510": "Amir Ishemgulov (Russian: \u0410\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u041c\u0438\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0430\u0445\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0418\u0448\u0435\u043c\u0433\u0443\u043b\u043e\u0432; 22 May 1960 \u2013 29 October 2020) was a Russian biologist and politician of Bashkir ethnicity,[3] Doctor of Biological Sciences,[2][3][1] professor.[1][2][3]/nIshemgulov was born on 22 May 1960, in Bashkortostan, RSFSR, Soviet Union.[3]/nHe was a distant relative of the writer Zainab Biisheva.[3] She took part in his upbringing.

His laboratory discovered that apical-basal polarisation of the transmembrane protein Crumbs - a key apical determinant - depends upon both a Cdc42-driven positive feedback loop as well as mutual antagonism between apical and basolateral determinants.[6][7] The Cdc42-driven positive feedback loop involves recruitment of Cdc42 complexes by Crumbs, followed by Cdc42-mediated polarisation of the cytoskeleton, including both actin filaments and microtubules, that allow transport of Crumbs-containing vesicles by the microtubule motor protein Dynein and the actin motor protein Myosin-V.[8][9] How Cdc42 polarises the cytoskeleton remains an important unsolved problem, but Cdc42 appears to act primarily via activating the kinases aPKC and Pak1 in Drosophila follicle cells.[10]/nHis laboratory also discovered that planar cell polarisation of the atypical myosin Dachs by the Fat and Dachsous cadherins is responsible for polarising tension at adherens junctions and thus influencing the orientation of cell shapes and cell divisions within the plane of the epithelium.[11] His lab subsequently found that this involved recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase FbxL7 to Fat, in order to degrade Dachs on one side of the cell, such that Dachs binds to Dachsous on the opposite side of the cell.[12]/nThompson's laboratory found that cell divisions in epithelia can also be oriented by mechanical forces arising from adjacent tissues growing at different rates.[13] In order for the mitotic spindle to orient in response to planar forces, highly columnar pseudostratified epithelial cells must round up at mitosis in a process that involves the Aurora A and B kinases, activation of Rho-mediated actomyosin contractility, remodelling of adherens junctions, and removal of the Lgl protein from the plasma membrane to allow spindle orienting factors to interact with Dlg/Scrib proteins and thereby align the spindle within the plane of the epithelium.[14][15]/nWhile epithelial cell polarity and cell proliferation are fundamental to the construction of an epithelium, and can influence the form of the entire tissue, epithelial morphogenesis also depends fundamentally on anchorage to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Thompson's lab showed that synthesis and enzymatic remodelling of the ECM were crucial to the shaping of Drosophila melanogaster tissues, particularly for formation of the adult fly wings, legs and halteres during metamorphosis.[16][17][18]/nThompson's lab discovered several components of the Hippo signaling pathway in Drosophila melanogaster (including Kibra,[19] Spectrins,[20] Mask[21]) and that this pathway functions to sense mechanical strain during development of epithelial cells in vivo,[22] as well as to sense nutritional status via the hormonal Insulin/IGF-1 and PI3K-Akt pathway,[23] in order to control cell proliferation, cellular morphology, and invasive cell migration. His lab has also had a major interest in the role of the Hippo pathway in mammals, including humans, where (unlike Drosophila) the pathway also responds to input from Integrin-Src family kinase signals to enable the mechanical control of epithelial cell proliferation and tissue regeneration,  .[24][25]", "23372065": "Jaroslav Flegr (born 12 March 1958) is a Czech parasitologist, evolutionary biologist, and author of the book Frozen Evolution.[2] He is professor of biology at the Faculty of Science, Charles University in Prague,[3] and is a member of the editorial board of the journal Neuroendocrinology Letters.[4]/nHis work on how toxoplasmosis\u2014an infection caused by the protozoan parasite T. gondii\u2014influences personality,[5] sex ratios,[6] and rates of traffic accidents,[7][8] has received coverage in The Atlantic,[9] Salon,[10] and The Guardian.[11] Flegr maintains that toxoplasmosis might increase the rate of traffic accidents by as much as one million collisions per year.[12][13][14] He also believes that T. gondii contributes to suicides and mental disorders such as schizophrenia.[9]/nFrozen Evolution is a popular science book which aims to explain current developments in evolutionary biology to a wide audience.

Using the oocyte nuclear protein nucleoplasmin, he provided the first demonstration that nuclear protein uptake is mediated by a specific polypeptide domain (11). This work identified a selective entry mechanism which implied the existence of a signal sequence within the protein specifying entry and cellular mechanisms for signal recognition and the physical movement of the protein through the nuclear pore complex./nHe subsequently established that nuclear protein accumulation occurs in two major steps, an energy-dependent binding of the nuclear protein to the nuclear membrane/nuclear pore complex and a subsequent energy-dependent translocation of the protein through the nuclear pore complex (12)./nThe first signal shown to be both necessary and sufficient to target proteins to the nucleus was identified in SV40 Large T antigen (14, 15, 16). However, this seven amino acid sequence (PKKKRKV) did not serve as a useful identifier of functional nuclear localization sequences in other proteins. Detailed mapping of the sequence in nucleoplasmin revealed a longer sequence motif within which two domains of basic amino acids are separated by a spacer of ten other amino acids (17). Detailed analysis of the bipartite nuclear localization sequence in nucleoplasmin revealed novel characteristics including the fact that the spacer length could be increased but not decreased without loss of function and that potential phosphorylation sites within the linker region have the potential to regulate signal function (17). Many  nuclear localization sequences showing these characteristics have since been identified  the bipartite nuclear localization sequence has emerged as the major nuclear localization sequence in cellular proteins and the sequence motif is the most successful identifier of functional nuclear localization sequences in proteins (18). He suggested a model for the possible functional interaction of the basic domains of the bipartite nuclear localization sequence with sites a putative receptor (19). The broad outline of this model was confirmed ten years later by the crystallographic analysis of importin alpha complexed with a bipartite nuclear localization sequence peptide (20,21)./nHe has held senior positions in the pharmaceutical industry and in academia and made significant contributions to research in gene regulation in HIV and in Alzheimer's disease (22,23)./n1.\thttps://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=dingwall+colin&oq=dingwall/n7.\tBonner WM.

He enjoys international recognition as an authority on the basic biology and medical significance of atypical bacterial organisms and is considered a pioneer and an expert on the role of these unusual bacteria in the persistence and expression of kidney and urological infectious diseases./nDomingue was named a Fellow of the American Academy for Microbiology (1973) and a Fellow of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (1975).[1][2] In 1995, he received the prestigious Palmes Academiques Medal (Chevalier) from the country of France./nDomingue was born in 1937 in Lafayette, Louisiana. He was educated at Southwestern Louisiana Institute (presently University of Louisiana at Lafayette), receiving the Bachelor of Science degree in three years (bacteriology with minors in chemistry and French); matriculating to graduate school at the University of Southwestern Louisiana (presently University of Louisiana at Lafayette)(graduate courses in bacteriology, atomic physics and advanced qualitative organic chemistry; served as instructor of laboratory courses in bacteriology and immunology in university); Louisiana State University(basic medical sciences) and Tulane University where he earned the doctorate (1964); holds the PhD degree in medical microbiology and immunology; followed by a postdoctoral research fellowship in microbiology/infectious diseases and a residency in clinical microbiology under the mentorship of the late distinguished bacteriologist/immunologist, Erwin Neter at The Children's Hospital of the University at Buffalo./nHe first became interested in the role of atypical bacterial forms after noting that a large number of patients with urinary tract infections suffer from continual relapsing illness. Using a direct phase microscope, he examined the urine specimens of several patients with urinary tract infections and found atypical bacteria in his samples./nHe began to investigate atypical bacteria (cell wall-defective, L-forms and difficult-to-culture bacteria) striving to better understand their biology and the role they play in causing disease. Over the course of the next 30 years, he was able to explain much of the mystery behind how the bacteria are able to persist in the body, and published a wide array of clinical and experimental studies on the subject./nDomingue worked with a team that included pre and post-doctoral students and fellows along with faculty colleagues and laboratory assistants. Together they discovered that L-form bacteria are able to form tiny dense bodies within parent cells that already lack cell walls. They noted that the forms, which they called electron dense bodies were so small that they could pass through bacterial filters that normally withheld ordinary bacteria with cell walls.[3][4]/nThe electron dense bodies could persist inside tissue culture cells in the laboratory. After applying these data to the human condition, Domingue reasoned that in some patients who suffer from chronic bacterial infections, the disease process could be related to the fact that bacteria are able to differentiate into the resistant electron dense bodies that he observed in tissue cultures.[5]/nIn 1974, he and his graduate student, Mary Green, along with Paul Heidger, a faculty collaborator, published two landmark companion papers in the journal Infection and Immunity.[3][4] The papers detail how L-form bacteria inside an experimental human embryonic kidney tissue culture system are able to persist in cells and explains how they are able to revert into the cell wall-containing parent bacterial form. They also proposed a detailed reproductive cycle for L-form bacteria, followed by electron microscopy of the microorganisms./nThese papers set the stage for Domingue and his team to delve even further into the role that cryptic atypical bacteria play in causing persistent and recurrent infections. In 1997, he and a colleague, the late Hannah Woody published an invited extensive review article on chronic bacterial infection in Clinical Microbiological Reviews.[5] Among their conclusions was the claim that \"difficult to culture and dormant bacteria are involved in the latency of infection and that these persistent bacteria may be pathogenic.\"/nHe implicated atypical bacteria in several kidney-related diseases including pyelonephritis,[6][7] glomerulonephritis, idiopathic hematuria,[8] and interstitial cystitis.[9] He also speculated about their role in other diseases such as rheumatic fever, tuberculosis, syphilis, and rheumatoid arthritis./nIn the review Domingue stated, \"Clearly, any patient with a history of recurrent infection and persistent disability is sending the signal that the phenomenon (infection with atypical bacteria) could be occurring. The so-called autoimmune diseases in which no organism can be identified by routine testing techniques are particularly suspect.\"[5] He went on to conclude, \"Bacteriologic advances, which include special culture media and stains, electron microscopy and molecular techniques such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction), have revealed an increasing number of previously unidentifiable organisms in a variety of pathological conditions. It is unwise to dismiss the pathogenic capacities of any microbe in a patient with a mysterious disease.\"[5] Over the course of his thirty-nine-year career Domingue published numerous papers, monographs, and book chapters devoted to atypical bacterial research. He delivered many invited international and national lectures about bacterial persistence and expression of disease and wrote a book on the subject, Cell Wall-Deficient Bacteria: Basic Principles and Clinical Significance.[10]/nAlthough Domingue's primary research focus was on bacterial L-forms, he also published extensively on the biological significance of the enterobacterial common antigen of gram negative bacteria\u2013 its antigenicity, immunogenicity, and vaccine potential against urinary tract infections.[11][12]/nHe studied the immunological consequences of a vasectomy, as well as the role of various gram negative pathogens in the host-pathogen interaction in pyelonephritis, and the effects of antibiotics and chemotherapy on urinary tract infections.[13][14]/nHe also published microbiological and immunological studies on bacteria that produce chorionic gonadotropin-like hormone and their role in an experimental tumor model.[15]", "66658617": "Reinhard F.

Truman, Stocker revealed how this change in segment identity \u2013 or the surgical displacement of appendages \u2013 affects the connections of sensory neurons from the appendage towards the central brain.[4][5][6][7][8][9][10] The developmental neurogenetics of the sensory systems in Drosophila melanogaster then emerged as Stocker's main research interest throughout his further career./nIn 1976 Stocker returned to the University of Basel, and in 1978 accepted a position as post-doctoral researcher (Assistant docteur) at the Institute of Zoology (later Department of Biology) at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, where he was tenured as post-doctoral fellow (Ma\u00eetre-assistant) in 1980. Summarized in his Habilitation at the University of Fribourg from 1985, Stocker's studies combined dye-filling of neurons, electron microscopy and the manipulation of the developmental fate of neurons by homeotic mutations.[11] Adopting the Gal4-UAS method for the cell-type specific manipulation of neurons as established by Brand and Perrimon in 1993 (Development 118, 401-415), this allowed him and his co-workers to describe at unprecedented detail and completeness the first relay of the olfactory system, the antennal lobe, and how it develops during metamorphosis. These studies were instrumental to map the wiring of olfactory sensory neurons expressing different olfactory receptor genes to these glomeruli and to understand the functional significance of this wiring for the combinatorial coding of odours.[12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22] They were also the basis for his promotion as Professor (Professeur associ\u00e9) at the University of Fribourg in 1993, and were cited by the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences in awarding him the Th\u00e9odore-Ott-Prize in 2007./nOver the years the Stocker lab at Fribourg University provided early insight into the neurogenetic and developmental bases of chemosensation and sexual behaviour[23][24][25][26][27][28][29] as well as into the origin of chemosensory neurons and their fate across metamorphosis.[30][31][32][33][34][35][36] From the 1990s on, Stocker and his co-workers furthermore established larval D. melanogaster as a study case for research into the behavioural neurogenetics of chemosensation and chemosensory learning, and the central brain circuits serving these functions (see Scientific publications: 34., 39., 47., 48., 50., 51., 55.-57., 59.-78.).[33][37][38][39][40][41][42][19]/nAcross his career, Stocker's scientific interests thus gradually shifted from the sensory periphery towards the central nervous system and behaviour. This \u2018outside-in\u2019 approach was grounded in a precise and complete description of the anatomy and development of the neuronal systems under study. Characteristic of his work furthermore  is the pioneering, early-adopting use of new methods and technology, including electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, cell-type specific transgene expression, and the use of larval Drosophila melanogaster as a study case for the brain and behavioural sciences./nAfter his retirement from the University of Fribourg in 2011, Stocker published a book of fiction.[43]/n2007: Th\u00e9odore Ott Prize of the Swiss Academy of Medical Science/n2008-today: Editorial board of The Journal of Comparative Neurology/nTechnical collaborators and lab management: Martine Schorderet, Nana\u00eb Gendre/nPhD students: Markus Lienhard, Madeleine Tissot, Klemens St\u00f6rtkuhl, Fran\u00e7ois Python, Julien Colomb, Mareike Selcho, Dennis Pauls/nPost-docs: Hans Schmid, Klemens St\u00f6rtkuhl, Gertrud Heimbeck, Bertram Gerber, Ariane Ramaekers, Nicola Grillenzoni, Andreas Thum/n2004: \"Neurofly\", Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland/n2007: \"Swiss Drosophila Meeting\", Fribourg/n2009: \"Swiss Society of Neuroscience\", Fribourg/n2010: \"Swiss Drosophila Meeting\", Fribourg/n2010: \"Drosophila Maggot Meeting: Neural Circuits to Behavior\", Bangalore, India/n78.

He was born in Charrecey, France, into a family of modest means. He was the son of Jean-Marie Tr\u00e9maux, a farmer and Claudine Renaudin, and had at least two sisters. Details of his final years are very sketchy and no details of his death and final resting place are known.[1]/nTr\u00e9maux distinguished himself in many fields. He entered the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in 1840 and received the second Prix de Rome in Architecture in 1845. As a trained architect, he worked at the Schneider establishments in Le Creusot. He was interested in urbanism and the construction of the Suez Canal in Egypt./nInterested in natural history, he traveled to Algeria, Tunisia, Upper Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia in 1847\u20131848, where he made many drawings and was one of the first persons to produce photographic images of these regions. From Alexandria, he traveled up the Nile to Nubia. In 1853\u20131854, he undertook a second photographic trip to Libya, Egypt, Asia Minor, Tunisia, Syria and Greece. Having spent seven years in the region, he returned from these trips with many illustrations and photographic images, some of the first photographs ever made of the region and its people.[2]/nWith 21 photographs and 56 lithographs made after his photos, relatively few have survived, and their condition is poor. According to Chief Curator of Photography at the Israel Museum, Nissan N. Perez, his photographs \"reveal that Tr\u00e9maux had an interest in anthropological photography, and, had he succeeded, it might have been a most important survey of Oriental types and customs, and not, as it is today, a mere gallery of curiosities.\"[3]/nNevertheless, his published works, such as the Voyages series of 1852 to 1862, were the first books on Egypt, Sudan, Palestine and other Middle Eastern regions with illustrations based on photographs by the author.[4]/nTr\u00e9maux is also the author of a work that caused a sensation at the 1867 Universal Exhibition in Paris titled, Origine et transformations de l'homme et des autres \u00eatres  (Origin and transformations of man and other beings, 1865). In this book he proposed an  evolutionary theory that racial differences have \"a natural basis\" in biology and geology, referred to nowadays as the theory of punctuated equilibria.[5]/nBetween 1852 and 1868, Tr\u00e9maux produced a number of distinct groups of photographic plates to accompany texts on the geography, architecture, and people of regions in Africa and Asia Minor. Produced with the support of the French government, these high quality publications combined an array of graphic techniques in ways that had not previously been attempted. His surviving images are salted paper prints, engravings, tinted and colour lithographs and photolithographs.[6]/nArticles/nBooks/nThis article includes material translated from the French Wikipedia, fr:Pierre Tr\u00e9maux", "65118531": "Adamu Abu Kasim is a Nigerian botanist and professor of science.[1] He was appointed as vice chancellor of Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai by Abubakar Sani Bello, assumed office in December 2019.[2][3][4]/nAdamu Abu Kasim was born in Dukku, in Rijau, Niger State.

At a science round table of the committee, when asked for her views on how much water should be returned to the River Murray, Marohasy argued that there was no need for additional flows at that time and that we should test the results of current environmental measures before committing to more.[11]/nMarohasy was instrumental in establishing a joint programme with the Institute of Public Affairs and the University of Queensland, funded by Western Australian philanthropist, Bryant Macfie (A top 20 Shareholder in Strike Resources Limited [1] [2][permanent dead link]).[12][13]/nIn a 2005 Australian Broadcasting Corporation interview she claimed that... \"[i]t's not clear that climate change is being driven by carbon dioxide levels\".[14]/nOn the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio National program, Ockham's Razor, Marohasy said in 2005... \"I agree with Professor Flannery that we need to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide levels\", later adding \"But I completely reject the concept of 'sustainability science' and I am tired of being told the sky is about to fall in\".[15]/nIn a 2008 interview on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio National program, Counterpoint, she claimed recent cooling by starting with the extreme temperature peak of the 1998 El Ni\u00f1o[16] event.[17]/nIn 2020, during and in the aftermath of the Black Summer Bushfires, Marohasy argued that climate change was not a contributing factor, and that the extent of the natural disaster was not as severe as some claimed.[18][19]/nMarohasy disagreed with the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), claiming in the Australian media [20] that  Cyclone Marcia's warning should be for a category 3 cyclone. BOM's Cyclone Marcia warning was for a category 5 cyclone.[21] Marohasy cited data from Middle Percy Island station[22] showing maximum wind gusts of 208 kilometres per hour.[23] BOM stated however, that the strongest winds of the cyclone were on the eastern side, some 40 kilometres per hour faster - typical for cyclones in the southern hemisphere. The cyclone was gaining in strength. Middle Percy Island was on the western side of the cyclone. Middle Percy Island measuring equipment was destroyed by the cyclone and therefore the BOM data stream ceased. Marohasy's claim, that BOM's category 5 warning was based solely on computer modeling, was rejected by Bureau chief Rob Webb./nJonathan Nott,[24] a James Cook University specialist in extreme natural events, said the bureau numbers showed it was a category 5 rather than a 3. \u201cI would agree with the bureau,\u2019\u2019 Nott said. \u201cPercy didn\u2019t get the strongest winds.

After graduation from regional school in 1883, he attended a gymnasium of the Institute of History and Philology of the town of Nizhyn. Between 1890 and 1894, he studied natural history at the faculty of physics and mathematics of Kazan University and then at the medical faculty of Kharkiv University. He worked as a military medical doctor until he successfully passed the exams for Master\u2019s Degree at Kharkiv University in 1899. In 1890, he was appointed for the position of privatdozent at Kharkiv University. In 1916, Taliev defended his Doctoral Thesis in Petrograd University titled \u201cA study of the process of species formation in living nature\u201d. In 1917, he was selected as a Dean of the Natural History Section of Kharkiv People\u2019s University. In 1918, Taliev was nominated for the Professor position of Petrovsky (later Timiryazev) Agricultural Academy.[2]/nTaliev was the author of a very popular botany textbook for agricultural, pedagogical and other higher educational institutions named \"Fundamentals of Botany in Evolutionary Presentation\" (first edition, 1907; sixth edition, 1931)[3] and of many other manuals for students. For a half a century, students of many universities in Russia and the USSR learned to identify higher plants according to Taliev\u2019s guides. In addition, Taliev compiled the guides for meadow and weed plants, which were reprinted several times. Valery Taliev was a masterful populariser of scientific knowledge. His books \u201cThe Structure and Life of Plants\u201d (1924), \u201cThe Unity of Life\u201d (1925), and \u201cThe Biology of our Plants\u201d (1925) are examples of Russian popular science literature.[1]/nValery Taliev was one of the first scientists who investigated the importance of anthropogenic factors in the evolution and spreading of plants. He outlined major parameters of the origin and spreading of weed plants, of the flora of riverbanks, and proposed a direct role of man in changing the balance between forests and steppes. The phenomenon of steppe floral communities over riverbanks is usually explained by the concept of glacial refugia. Taliev developed an alternative anthropogenic concept for the explanation of the origin of these plants rejecting the relict character of flora present on limestone, chalk, and sand deposits and considering these deposits as the consequences of human activity that destroyed upper soil layers. Although the glacial refugia concept is now widely accepted, it is also evident that, during the Holocene, the post-glacial spreading of plants was facilitated and constrained by human activity, and determination of the level of human impact and its direction is an important scientific task. Taliev viewed weed flora as invasive, having the southern origin, and evolved in drier continental climates.[4] He mentioned the characteristic features of weeds as their adaptation to keep humidity and decrease transpiration which is now explained by the features and type of their photosynthetic metabolism. The anthropogenic factor, according to Taliev, was also essential in the formation of steppes. Taliev considered the absence of forest in southern Russia as a consequence of the activity of the early settlers who destroyed forests and opened the new areas for plant spreading./nTaliev considered that the evolutionary process is not derivable from one stereotype scheme and could proceed by different ways. He analyzed multiple cases of evolutionary development in the defined directions and mentioned that evolution involves the building up of new pathways over already existing cycles of individual development. Taliev explained directed evolution by the physical and chemical reasons and suggested that in the course of evolution, repetitive phenomena or a progressive increase in a morphological or physiological feature, or, conversely, its weakening, can be associated with the concept of chemical series, such as in hydrocarbons. Thus, Taliev anticipated the role of anisotropy of chemical reactions in biological evolution, which is currently considered as an important basis of evolutionary pattern formation.[5] Based on the geographical distribution of plants, Taliev related the reason for the splitting of characters to the external conditions, considering that polychroism and polymorphism in plants are associated with a certain geographical area defined as the \u201ccenter of speciation\u201d.[6] \u00a0He represented the speciation in the genus Tulipa in the form of a stream flowing out of the primary center, common to a whole group of adjacent systematic lines, and gradually fading in its diversity,[7] in the transition to new conditions, a more or less significant outbreak of a new speciation process resulting in a new evolutionary adaptation. In the ideas of the series of variability he anticipated the law of homological series of Nikolai Vavilov, while in the concept of center of speciation he anticipated Vavilov's concept of species and the centers of their origin.[8] In relation to post-glacial events, Taliev linked the evolutionary variability of plants to their spreading to new geographical areas determined by human activity. The quantitative side of evolution, according to Taliev, is determined by the principle that he defined as the principle of maximum productivity. It corresponds to the maximum power principle of Lotka.[9] This principle explains the property of ascendency, i.e. the ability of ecosystems to prevail against disturbance through the autocatalytic feedbacks incorporated in their organization.[10]", "62333386": "G\u00e9rard Orth (7 February 1936 \u2013 4 September 2023) was a French virologist, emeritus research director at the CNRS, honorary professor at the Pasteur Institute./nG\u00e9rard Orth had devoted his research to the study of the role of viruses in the genesis of human cancers.

When he was one and a half years old, he fell into a fireplace and suffered a burn injury on his left hand. There was no doctor in the small village, but one of the men examined the boy. \"The fingers of the left hand are mostly gone,\" he said, \"and the left arm, the left foot, and the right hand are burned; I don't know how badly.\"[2]/nIn 1883, Noguchi entered Mitsuwa elementary school. Thanks to generous contributions from his teacher Kobayashi and his friends, he was able to receive surgery on his badly burned hand. He recovered about 70% mobility and functionality in his left hand through the operation./nNoguchi decided to become a doctor to help those in need. He apprenticed himself to Dr. Kanae Watanabe (\u6e21\u90e8 \u9f0e, Watanabe Kanae), the same doctor who had performed the surgery. He entered Saisei Gakusha, which later became Nippon Medical School. He passed the examinations to practice medicine when he was twenty years old in 1897. He showed signs of great talent and was supported in his studies by Dr. Morinosuke Chiwaki. In 1898, he changed his first name to Hideyo after reading a Tsubouchi Sh\u014dy\u014d novel of college students whose character had the same name\u2014Seisaku\u2014as him. The character in the story was an intelligent medical student like Noguchi but became lazy and ruined his life.[3]/nIn 1900 Noguchi travelled on the America Maru to the United States, where he obtained a job as a research assistant with Dr. Simon Flexner at the University of Pennsylvania and later at the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research. He thrived in this environment.[4]  At this time his work concerned venomous snakes.  In part, his move was motivated by difficulties in obtaining a medical position in Japan, as prospective employers were concerned that his hand deformity would discourage potential patients. In a research setting, he did not have a handicap. He and his peers learned from their work and from each other. In this period, a fellow research assistant in Flexner's lab was Frenchman Alexis Carrel, who would go on to win a Nobel Prize in 1912.[5]/nNoguchi's work later attracted the Prize committee's scrutiny.[6] In the 21st century, the Nobel Foundation archives were opened for public inspection and research. Historians found that Noguchi was nominated several times for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine: in 1913\u20131915, 1920, 1921 and 1924\u20131927.[7] During the 1920s, his work was being increasingly criticized for inaccuracies.[citation needed] In 1921, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.[8]/nWhile working at the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research in 1911, he was accused of inoculating orphan children with syphilis in the course of a clinical study.[9] He was acquitted of any wrongdoing at the time but, since the late 20th century, his conduct of the study has come to be considered an early instance of unethical human experimentation. At the time, society had not developed a consensus about how to conduct human experimentation and feelings varied about the medical research community. Antivivisectionists linked their concerns for animals with concerns about humans.[10] The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children was founded in the late 19th century after the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals./nIn 1913, Noguchi demonstrated the presence of Treponema pallidum (syphilitic spirochete) in the brain of a progressive paralysis patient, proving that the spirochete was the cause of the disease.[11]  Dr. Noguchi's name is remembered in the binomial attached to another spirochete, Leptospira noguchii.[12]/nIn 1918, Noguchi traveled extensively in Central America and South America working with the International Health Board to conduct research to develop a vaccine for yellow fever, and to research Oroya fever, poliomyelitis and trachoma. He believed that yellow fever was caused by spirochaete bacteria instead of a virus. He worked for much of the next ten years trying to prove this theory. His work on yellow fever was widely criticized as taking an inaccurate approach that was contradictory to contemporary research, and confusing yellow fever with other pathogens. In 1927-28 three different papers appeared in medical journals that discredited his theories.[13] It turned out he had confused yellow fever with leptospirosis. The vaccine he developed against \"yellow fever\" was successfully used to treat the latter disease./nIn 1911 and 1912 at the Rockefeller Institute in New York City, Noguchi was working to develop a syphilis skin test similar to the tuberculin skin test. The subjects were recruited from clinics and hospitals in New York. In the experiment, Noguchi injected an extract of syphilis, called luetin, under the subjects' upper arm skin. Skin reactions were studied, as they varied among healthy subjects and syphilis patients, based on the disease's stage and its treatment. Of the 571 subjects, 315 had syphilis. The remaining subjects were \"controls;\" they were orphans or hospital patients who did not have syphilis. The hospital patients were already being treated for various non-syphilitic diseases, such as malaria, leprosy, tuberculosis, and pneumonia. Finally, the controls were normal individuals, mostly children between the ages of 2 and 18 years.[14] Critics at the time, mainly from the anti-vivisectionist movement, noted that Noguchi violated the rights of vulnerable orphans and hospital patients. There was concern on the part of anti-vivisectionists that the children would get syphilis from Noguchi's experiments.[15][16]/nIt became a public scandal and the media discussed it. The editor of Life pointed out:/nIf the researcher had said to these patients: \"Have I your permission to inject into your system a concoction more or less related to a hideous disease?\"\u2014the invalids might have declined.[17]/nIn Noguchi's defense, Rockefeller Institute business manager Jerome D. Greene wrote a letter to the anti-vivisection society, which had protested the experiment. Greene pointed out that Noguchi had tested the extract on himself before administering it to subjects, and his fellow researchers had done the same, so it was impossible that the injections could cause syphilis. However, Noguchi himself was diagnosed with untreated syphilis in 1913, for which he refused treatment from Rockefeller Hospital.[16] At the time, Greene's explanation was considered a demonstration of the importance of the studies and care the doctors were taking in research. In May 1912 the New York Society for the Prevention for Cruelty to Children asked the New York district attorney to press charges against Noguchi; he declined.[18]/nIn the United States, it was not until the late 20th century that sufficient consensus developed about human experimentation to gain passage of laws to protect subjects. Along the way, more protocols were developed about informed consent and rights of patients/subjects.[16]/nFollowing the death of British pathologist Adrian Stokes of yellow fever in September 1927,[19] it became increasingly evident that yellow fever was caused by a virus, not by the bacillus Leptospira icteroides, as Noguchi believed.[citation needed]/nFeeling his reputation was at stake, Noguchi hastened to Lagos to carry out additional research. However, he found the working conditions in Lagos did not suit him. At the invitation of Dr. William Alexander Young, the young director of the British Medical Research Institute, Accra, Gold Coast (modern-day Ghana), he moved to Accra and made this his base in 1927./nHowever, Noguchi proved a very difficult guest and by May 1928 Young regretted his invitation. Noguchi was secretive and volatile, working almost entirely at night to avoid contact with fellow researchers. The diaries of Oskar Klotz, another researcher with the Rockefeller Foundation,[20] describe Noguchi's temper and behavior as erratic and bordering on the paranoid. His methods were haphazard./nAccording to Klotz, he inoculated huge numbers of monkeys with yellow fever, but failed to keep proper records. He may have believed himself immune to yellow fever, having been inoculated with a vaccine of his own development. Possibly his erratic and irresponsible behavior was caused by the untreated syphilis with which he was diagnosed in 1913, and which may have progressed to neurosyphilis.[citation needed]/nDespite repeated promises to Young, Noguchi failed to keep infected mosquitoes in their specially designed secure housing. In May 1928, having failed to find evidence for his theories, Noguchi was set to return to New York, but was taken ill in Lagos./nHe boarded his ship to sail home, but on 12 May was put ashore at Accra and taken to a hospital with yellow fever. After lingering for some days, he died on 21 May.[21]/nIn a letter home, Young states, \"He died suddenly noon Monday. I saw him Sunday afternoon \u2013 he smiled \u2013 and amongst other things, said, \u201cAre you sure you are quite well?\" \"Quite.\" I said, and then he said \"I don\u2019t understand.\"[22]/nSeven days later, despite exhaustive sterilisation of the site and most particularly of Noguchi's laboratory, Young himself died of yellow fever.[23]/nWhile Noguchi was influential during his lifetime, later research was not able to reproduce many of his claims, including having discovered the causes of polio, rabies, syphilis, trachoma, and yellow fever.[24]  His finding that Noguchia granulosis causes trachoma was questioned within a year of his death, and overturned shortly thereafter.[25][26] His identification of the rabies pathogen was wrong,[27]  because the medium he invented to cultivate bacteria was seriously prone to contamination.[28] A fellow Rockefeller Institute researcher said that Noguchi \"knew nothing about the pathology of yellow fever\" and criticized him for being unwilling to issue retractions for false claims, saying, \"I don't think that Noguchi was an honest scientist\".[29] Noguchi's failures have often been attributed to his tendency to work in isolation without the skeptical eye of fellow researchers.[13][30] What are considered flaws in the Rockefeller Institute's system of peer review is also a frequent subject of criticism.[31]/nNoguchi's most famous contribution is his identification of the causative agent of syphilis (the bacteria Treponema pallidum) in the brain tissues of patients with partial paralysis due to meningoencephalitis.[32] Other lasting contributions include the use of snake venom in serums, the identification of the leishmaniasis pathogen and of Carrion's disease with Oroya fever. His claim to have grown a culture of syphilis is considered irreproducible.[citation needed]/nNoguchi was honored with Japanese and foreign decorations. He received honorary degrees from a number of universities./nHe was self-effacing in his public life, and he often referred to himself as \"funny Noguchi.\" Those who knew him well said that he \"gloated in honors.\"[33] When Noguchi was awarded an honorary doctorate at Yale, William Lyon Phelps observed that the kings of Spain, Denmark and Sweden had conferred awards, but \"perhaps he appreciates even more than royal honors the admiration and the gratitude of the people.\"[34]/nNoguchi's remains were returned to the United States and buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City.[43]/nIn 1928, the Japanese government awarded Noguchi the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star, which represents the second highest of eight classes associated with the award.[44]/nIn 1979, the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR) was founded with funds donated by the Japanese government[45] at the University of Ghana in Legon, a suburb north of Accra.[46]/nIn 1981, the Instituto Nacional de Salud Mental (National Institute of Mental Health) \"Honorio Delgado - Hideyo Noguchi\" was founded with founds of the Peruvian Government and the JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency) in Lima - Per\u00fa.[47]/nDr. Noguchi's portrait has been printed on Japanese 1000-yen banknotes since 2004.[48] In addition, the house near Inawashiro where he was born and brought up is preserved. It is operated as part of a museum to his life and achievements./nNoguchi's name is honored at the Centro de Investigaciones Regionales Dr. Hideyo Noguchi at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Yucat\u00e1n.[49]/nA 2.1\u00a0km street in Guayaquil, Ecuador downtown is named after Dr. Hideyo Noguchi./nThe Japanese Government established the Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize in July 2006 as a new international medical research and services award to mark the official visit by Prime Minister Jun'ichir\u014d Koizumi to Africa in May 2006 and the 80th anniversary of Dr. Noguchi's death.[50]  The Prize is awarded to individuals with outstanding achievements in combating various infectious diseases in Africa or in establishing innovative medical service systems.[51]  The presentation ceremony and laureate lectures coincided with the Fourth Tokyo International Conference on African Development in late April 2008.[52] In 2009, the conference venue was moved from Tokyo to Yokohama as another way of honoring the man after whom the prize was named. In 1899, Dr. Noguchi worked at the Yokohama Port Quarantine Office as an assistant quarantine doctor.[53]/nThe Prize is expected to be awarded every five years.[54] The prize has been made possible through a combination of government funding and private donations.[55]", "5349842": "Richard Anthony Jefferson (born 1956) is an American-born molecular biologist and social entrepreneur who developed the widely used reporter gene system GUS,[3] conducted the world's first biotech crop release, proposed the Hologenome theory of evolution, pioneered Biological Open Source and founded The Lens.  He is founder of the social enterprise Cambia and a professor of Biological Innovation at the Queensland University of Technology.  In 2003 he was named by Scientific American as one of the world's 50 most influential technologists, and is renowned for his work on making science-enabled innovation more widely accessible.[4][5]  He was profiled in 'Open & Shut: The Basement Interviews',[6] and other major media, including in an Economist Feature 'Grassroots Innovator' in 2001.[7]/nBorn in Santa Cruz, California, Jefferson studied at the University of California, Santa Barbara at the College of Creative Studies, and obtained his BA (Molecular Genetics) in 1978. He then moved to the University of Colorado Boulder for his Ph.D., where he first developed the GUS reporter system, isolating, sequencing and characterizing the first microbial glucuronidase,[3][8] and creating transgenic technology for Caenorhabditis elegans[9]/nAs a postdoctoral researcher he worked at the Plant Breeding Institute in Cambridge, England: there he adapted the GUS assay for the use in plants.[3] His GUS system was a breakthrough in plant molecular sciences, useful for the development of efficient transformation methods for crop plants, and cell and developmental biology.  In 1986-87 he sent all the components of the GUS system (DNA and strains) together with a comprehensive users' manual to nearly a thousand labs worldwide, before publication, pioneering a biological open source paradigm and a rapid uptake of the technology.   The GUS system and its novel mode of dissemination was said to be essential for development of transformation of the most important crops, including soybean, maize, cotton and rice.   The work has been cited in the primary literature almost 15,000 times.,[10] and has been licensed by every major company in crop genetics./nDuring his postdoc in Cambridge, he also initiated and managed, with his colleague Michael W. Bevan, the world's first field release of a transgenic food crop (June 1, 1987), in Trumpington, near Cambridge, UK.[11][12]  The planting date of the experiment was serendipitously one day before that of Monsanto, in Jerseyville, Illinois, which has been widely but incorrectly viewed as the first such trial.[13][14]/nIn 1989, driven by a need to see the tools of science more broadly accessible and more effectively used in complex environments, Jefferson joined the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) as senior scientist, the first molecular biologist in this position. Since then he traveled, worked and taught in many developing countries. He left the organization in 1991 to start a non-profit private social enterprise, Cambia.  Cambia soon moved to Australia, due to Jefferson's involvement in the Asian rice biotechnology programs of the Rockefeller Foundation,[11] and the proximity to almost half the world's agricultural population./nIn September 1994, Jefferson first articulated the Hologenome Theory of Evolution, at a presentation at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, at a Symposium \"A Decade of PCR\" [15]    This theory was developed from his molecular and genetic work on glucuronide metabolism by vertebrate-associated microbes, including the role of glucuronidases, sulfatases and other enzymes in modulating and effecting enterohepatic circulation of steroid hormones.  The levels, ratios and timing of steroid hormone de-conjugation (activation) and resorption modulates virtually all aspects of vertebrate ontogeny, physiology and reproduction.   The premise for his theory was that natural selection acts on the holobiont comprising a 'scaffold genome' and myriad microbial constituents in diverse ecosystems, selecting for persistence of the set of genetically encoded capabilities./nIn January 1997, the hologenome theory was extended, informed by further work on the molecular genetics of enteric microbial glucuronide metabolism,  to emphasize the central role of microbially-mediated hormone modulation (MHM) as an essential component of multi-cellularity and vertebrate biology.  This led Jefferson to coin the term ecotherapeutics, or ecological therapeutics, stating that a major route to improved performance or health of animals or plants would be through the adjustment of microbial populations and their genetic capabilities (microbiota, often now called the microbiomes).[16]/nThe development of theory and its logic were also outlined in detail in his blog in 2007,[17] and summarized in a cover article Jan 9, 2013, by Carrie Arnold in New Scientist [18]/nIn 1999, Jefferson was appointed as Author-in-Chief to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity for the landmark study, submitted to the UN General Assembly, on the contentious genetic technology, colloquially called 'Terminator Technology'.  In this study [19] he coined and defined the term GURT - Genetic Use Restriction Technology and its variants./nAt Cambia, and with the initial funding and partnership with Rockefeller Foundation's agriculture program, Jefferson and the Cambia staff started to develop key new tools - including the pCambia vectors,[20] released in 1997, and which now are the most widely used plasmids in plant biotechnology./nThe continuous distribution of thousands of these tools without restrictions throughout the world, the dozens of conducted training courses, and the newly invented open technologies advanced what would become the Biological Open Source initiative, formally launched in 2005.   In that year Jefferson and colleagues published a landmark paper in Nature [21] in which they described a new biological open source invention, TransBacter./nAgrobacterium-mediated gene transfer was by far the most common tool for agricultural biotechnology, but due to complex and extensive patenting, and aggressive pursuit of dominant patents by Monsanto, the use of the tool was constrained to merely academic pursuits or by use of multinational corporations under license.    Using Patent Lens - the most popular global open full-text patent search engine - founded by Jefferson and his colleague Carol Nottenburg in 1999 as CambiaIP Resource - Cambia published the world's first open patent landscape.[22]  Using the evidence and clarity obtained from this patent landscape, Jefferson and his colleagues designed and created an effective alternative technology that would not be constrained by any of the existing patents (of which there were by then almost a thousand).  The technology, called Transbacter involved using three taxes of benign plant-associated bacteria modified with the gene-transfer components from Agrobacterium, to efficiently transfer genes to diverse crop species.  \"Transbacter\" was made available under the first BiOS (Biological Open Source) license, for free to anyone and sent to hundreds of labs worldwide, and was licensed by public sector, small enterprise and multinationals under open principles, with commitments to share improvements with other licensees.    The open patent landscape, initially authored by patent experts Nottenburg and Carolina Roa-Rodriguez and later updated by several other Cambia staff, in addition to many other landscapes serve as prototypes of Jefferson's subsequent initiative; open Innovation Cartography [23]/nIn 2009, with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, The Lemelson Foundation and the Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation, Jefferson moved with part of Cambia to the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Brisbane, Australia, as Professor of Science, Technology & Law, to direct the global activities on open Innovation Cartography.[24]/nKnown also for his expertise in intellectual property,  Jefferson remains active in the promotion of open source biological innovation which has been covered extensively by global media.[25] He served on the World Economic Forum's Global Agenda Council on Intellectual Property for four years, and is on the WEF's Global Agenda Council on the Economics of Innovation.   In 2013 Cambia launched The Lens[26] to replace the older Patent Lens and enable broader innovation-focused navigation platforms.   Jefferson is considered a global leader in social entrepreneurship and is an Outstanding Social Entrepreneur of the Schwab Foundation,[27] and a plenary speaker at the Skoll World Forum.[28] Jefferson was also a keynote speaker at Consilience 2016, organised by National Law School of India University, Bengaluru on Intellectual Property and the Commons.[29]", "6365656": "Yuen Kwok-yung GBS JP (Chinese: \u8881\u570b\u52c7; born 30 December 1956) is a Hong Kong microbiologist, physician and surgeon.

During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, he has acted as expert adviser to the Hong Kong government.[1]/nYuen graduated from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong in 1981 with distinction in Medicine. Initially trained as a surgeon, he switched successfully to a physician and, subsequently, a clinical microbiologist. He worked at the United Christian Hospital, and after 6 years service, left to join a research team at the Queen Mary Hospital.[2] In the outbreak of avian influenza virus H5N1 in 1997 in Hong Kong, Yuen was the first to report in the Lancet about the unusual clinical severity and high mortality of infected patients, which could be identified by the in-house molecular test at his laboratory.[3] Yuen became the Scientific co-director between the HKU-Pasteur Research Centre and the University of Hong Kong in 2000.Overseeing the research of microbes which are used by the Hong Kong government to control and contain epidemics.[4] During the global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, he led his team in the discovery of SARS-CoV-1,[5] and subsequently traced its genetic origins to wild bats.[6] For these achievements he was honoured by Time Asia magazine as one of its \"Asian heroes of the year\" in 2003.[5]/nHe has led his team in the discovery of other disease agents, such as the novel Human coronavirus HKU1, bat coronavirus HKU2 to HKU13, Laribacter hongkongensis and many other bacteria named after Hong Kong or China.[7]/nYuen is currently the Chair of Infectious Disease at the Department of Microbiology of the University of Hong Kong.

He is also a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering (Medicine and Health section)./nYuen is involved in the research on SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.[8] He was an early advocate of wearing masks even by healthy individuals, citing asymptomatic cases and a large number of virus strands in saliva of an infected person.[9]/nYuen's information videos on preventing the spread of the virus are published on the website of the University of Hong Kong.[10]/nYuen caused controversy when he and co-author David Lung published an op-ed article titled \"The pandemic originated from Wuhan and the lessons from 17 years ago have been forgotten.\" in the Chinese-language newspaper Ming Pao, stating that the trading and consumption of wild animals was a result of the inferior culture of Chinese people. The authors later retracted the article and apologised for the statement.[11]/nIn an interview with the BBC, Yuen accused the Chinese authorities of covering up the scale of the virus. He claimed that he alerted mainland health officials on 12 January 2020 to suspected human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This warning was not made public until 19 January. He also accused the authorities of destroying evidence: \"When we went to the Huanan supermarket, of course, there was nothing to see because the market was clean already. So, you may say that the crime scene is already disturbed. Because the seafood market was cleared, we cannot identify the animal host, which has given the virus to humans.\", said Yuen.[12][13]/nYuen was one of the lead authors of an article in Clinical Infections Diseases, published in August 2020, which described the first proven case of a COVID-19 reinfection of a patient with a different strain of SARS-CoV-2.[14]/nOn 6 December 2020, during the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong, Yuen said that the wave had been expected and urged the public to remain vigilant with regard to social contacts on Christmas. At the same time, he expressed his confidence that the wave would remain under control if the city went back to the social distancing measures that had been in place in July.[15]/nIn an opinion article published by Kwong together with fellow microbiologists Lung and Kelvin Chiu in Ming Pao on 25 August 2021, the authors argued that it would be impossible to eradicate COVID-19 due to the constant appearance of new strains, as well as the presence of asymptomatic cases, which distinguished it from smallpox, the only disease which had been successfully eradicated. They urged Hongkongers to get vaccinated as soon as possible.[16]/nOn 22 November 2021, a public health investigation concluded with the finding that one of two cases of the Omicron variant at a quarantine hotel had likely been infected by the other. The first case had been wearing valve-equipped face masks, and sometimes none, when stepping out of his room, which allegedly led to a contamination of the corridor and the infection of a person staying in the opposite room. Yuen ascribed the transmission to the use of valve masks, which he called \"selfish\" by design as they did not filter the exhaled air, which he said was \"not good\".[17] On 24 November, the Centre for Health Protection forbade the use of valve masks effective from the following day, and exhorted the public to refrain from using them.[18]/nOn 29 November 2021, a team led by Yuen succeeded in isolating the Omicron variant.[19]/nOn 19 January 2022, Yuen published a statement justifying the culling of 2,000 hamsters by the Hong Kong government sparking backlash from animal rights activist groups.[20]/nOn 23 January 2022, Yuen warned that if a recent outbreak with the Omicron variant in Kwai Chung Estate with over 100 cases failed to be contained, this could result in that outbreak to last up to three months and to have a major impact on businesses.[21] He reiterated his earlier statements that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was there to stay, and questioned the heavy focus of the government on zero coronavirus cases; the zero-Covid policy should be considered as a means to \"buy time\" to increase the vaccination rate, not as a way for anti-pandemic measures to end.[22] In relation to Chief Executive Carrie Lam having removed her mask after taking her seat at a press briefing a day earlier, Yuen assessed the risk of transmission in that situation as low but urged experts and leaders to \"set an example\" themselves by wearing a mask, as he himself would wear two.[23]/nOn 10 February 2022, Yuen suggested that, in view of insufficient resources to handle the pandemic, the infected with no or mild COVID-19 symptoms isolate at home and unvaccinated elderly, or chronic patients they live with, be moved to spaces at centres such as AsiaWorld-Expo to avoid cross-infection.[24][25]/nIn an article published in early March 2022, Yuen and his team identified Omicron variants with specific spike proteins that will give it antibody evasive properties. This finding showed how the new Omicron variant can lower the efficiency of vaccines in use.[26]/nOn 15 July, Yuen and his team published an article outlining the next course of action for the Hong Kong government during COVID- 19. His team commented on the fact that Covid-19 cannot be cleared completely, and the government should shift their priority from lowering cases to boosting vaccination rates to achieve hybrid-immunity.[27]/nOn 5 December, Yuen and his team helped create\u00a0a nasal spray that is effective against Omicron. The vaccine has gained the approval of the Chinese National Medical Products administration and is projected to manufacture 200 million doses by Wantai BioPharm.

He has been Professor of Molecular Immunology in the Division of Cancer Therapeutics at the Institute of Cancer Research, London since 2020./nHis contributions in biotechnology include chairing the Scientific Advisory Board of Cambridge Antibody Technology from its launch until its IPO, of Quadrant Healthcare until its acquisition by Elan, and of Kymab until its acquisition by Sanofi. He was an SAB member of Domantis until acquisition by GSK, and a Non-Executive Board member of Aptuscan until its acquisition by Avacta. He is a co-founder of two start-up companies, Orbit Discovery and Quadrucept Bio./nHis research has focussed on antibody and T cell receptor gene diversity, gene rearrangement and aberrant rearrangement of chromosomes (chromosomal translocations) in cancer. He pioneered the method of cDNA cloning, an approach universally used in bioscience and biotechnology, and elucidated the organization, diversity and rearrangement of human antibody genes, which defined the building blocks for construction of therapeutic antibody repertoires. He also pioneered chimaeric antibodies (with the late Michael Neuberger). He discovered the LMO and HOX11 chromosomal translocation oncogene families in T cell leukaemia and the first fusion gene in a solid tumour. He developed the first knock-in gene, now a widely employed approach in gene targeting and gene editing. He also pioneered the design of intracellular antibody single domain fragments (iDAbs) and established approaches to develop these macromolecules (these he called macrodrugs) with warheads to induce cellular phenotypes). He has developed methods to select chemical compound surrogates using single domain intracellular antibody fragments as competitors. These methods have resulted in drug leads for the previously considered undruggable RAS proteins and the hard-to-drug translocation proteins LMO2. His methods allow the use of intracellular antibody fragments to select chemical compounds that bind to disordered proteins within cells. Since 2020, his laboratory work has been focussed on developing methods to deliver intracellular antibody fragments into cells as drugs per se and targeting fusion proteins made from chromosomal translocations./nHe is a Fellow of the Royal Society, a Founder Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences, an EMBO Member and a Fellow of the American Association for Cancer Research Academy. He has been awarded the Colworth Medal, the CIBA prize and the Clotten Foundation Prize in recognition for his work on the diversity and rearrangement of human antibody genes, and on chromosomal translocation genes in cancer aetiology.", "8102444": "Katharine Jeannette Bush (December 30, 1855 \u2013 January 19, 1937)[1] was an American zoologist and marine biologist./nShe was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and was educated in the public and private schools of New Haven, Connecticut.

In 1925 and 1926, he published two volumes of Greek poems belonging to Kostis Palamas[13] and other modern Greek poets.[1] These translations were coauthored with George Katsimbalis, the man portrayed in Henry Miller's novel The Colossus of Maroussi along with Stephanides himself and Lawrence Durrell.[14] They met during World War I and would become lifelong friends and collaborators.[10]/nStephanides returned to Corfu in 1928.[2] The same year, along with his friend Philoctetes Paramythiotis (1893\u20131996), Stephanides founded the first radiological laboratory of the Ionian Islands. They co-directed the X-ray unit until 1938, when Stephanides moved to Thessaloniki.[2][9] A somewhat fictionalized account of Stephanides' work at the radiological laboratory appears in The Durrells series (season 3), with young Margo Durrell acting as his assistant./nIn 1930, Stephanides married Mary Alexander, the granddaughter of a former British consul in Corfu.[1] The couple had one child, Alexia Stephanides-Mercouri (1931\u20132018).[1][2][15] Alexia was a close friend of Gerald Durrell in Corfu, and Stephanides hoped that the two would marry one day, but the outbreak of World War II ruined these plans.[16][17] Alexia went on to marry Spyros Mercouris (1926\u20132018), the brother of Greek actress Melina Mercouri.[15][18] They had two children, Pyrrhus and Alexander Mercouris.[19]/nStephanides grew interested in freshwater biology in the 1930s.[1][20] In 1936, following instructions from the Greek government, he started to work on his scientific magnum opus, a treatise on the freshwater biology of Corfu, which would be published in 1948.[1] During his research, Stephanides discovered three microscopic water organisms, Cytherois stephanidesi, Thermocyclops stephanidesi and Schizopera stephanidesi.[1][3]/nIn the summer of 1935, Stephanides made the acquaintance of the Durrell family, who had recently moved to Corfu.[21] He quickly developed a close friendship with two of the Durrell brothers, Lawrence and Gerald, who would remain his lifelong friends.[1][21] As Gerald Durrell would later recall, Stephanides produced an enormous effect upon him, \"a budding naturalist of ten\" at that time, helping him develop his exploration skills. \"Not many young naturalists have the privilege of having their footsteps guided by a sort of omnipotent, benign and humorous Greek god,\" wrote Durrell.[22]/nThe two Durrell brothers would feature Stephanides in their memoirs of the time they spent in Corfu: Gerald in his Corfu trilogy (which includes the bestseller My Family and Other Animals, first published in 1956),[23][24] and Lawrence in Prospero's Cell (first edition: 1945).[25][26] Stephanides, too, would write memoirs on that period, which consist mostly of reminiscences about Lawrence Durrell and his then-wife, Nancy. Fragments from them were published by the Deus Loci journal in the 1970s and 1980s, while the full version appeared in 2011 under the title Corfu Memoirs in the collection of Stephanides' works Autumn Gleanings.[1]/nDuring 1938 and 1939, Stephanides participated in the anti-malaria campaign in Salonica and Cyprus, organized by the Rockefeller Foundation.[1][20] Earlier, in 1933, Stephanides drew up a report on anti-malaria measures to be performed in Corfu, based on directives from the Corfiot health authorities.[3]/nAs Stephanides came back to Corfu in 1939, for a brief period, he made an acquaintance with Henry Miller, who later remembered: \"Theodore is the most learned man I have ever met, and a saint to boot.\"[27]/nAt the outbreak of World War II, Stephanides had to leave Corfu again and would only return there on rare occasions.[1][2] Nevertheless, he would keep fond memoirs of the island and the influence it produced on him.[1]/nDuring World War II, being a British citizen, Stephanides served as a medical officer (lieutenant, and later major) in the Royal Army Medical Corps of the British Army in continental Greece, Crete, the Sahara and Sicily.[1][3][10][28] In May 1941, Stephanides was in Crete with the Allied forces during the German invasion.[28] As the Allies were retreating across the island to be evacuated by sea, Stephanides walked in boots several sizes too large, which made him limp for some time after that.[29] During the last stage of their long and exhausting march, he and another medical officer took charge of a group of about one hundred walking wounded, and they had to walk in open under the protection of the Red Cross flag, without any weapons or even steel helmets.[30] Eventually, they succeeded in reaching the embarkation beach and were evacuated by H.M.A.S. Perth to Alexandria.[31]/nIn 1946, Stephanides published Climax in Crete, an eyewitness account of the Battle of Crete. Lawrence Durrell wrote a foreword to it, where he remarked: \"For clearness, accuracy, and unselfconsciousness [this account] is quite fit to rank beside the compilations of any modern Purchas... It evokes the atmosphere of Greece and Crete during the German attack with a fidelity I have not seen elsewhere equalled; and to those who were there it will no doubt come as a refreshment after the scrappy sensational prose works of the professional journalists.\"[32] Lawrence's brother, Gerald Durrell, mentioned that Climax in Crete was \"one of the best war books written\".[22] Alan G. Thomas also praised it, saying that it was \"one of the best individual accounts of a campaign written from the human point of view\".[33] Climax in Crete is quoted extensively by English military historian Antony Beevor in his book Crete: The Battle and the Resistance.[34]/nStephanides' parents were killed in Corfu during the 1943 German bombing of the island, while his wife Mary and daughter Alexia had moved to England in 1939 and stayed safe until the end of the war, living with the Durrells in Bournemouth for some time.[1][4]/nAfter his evacuation from Crete, Stephanides served in the Western Desert for two years, and then, in the summer of 1943, he took part in the Allied invasion of Sicily.[4] Stephanides' experiences in the Western Desert are described in his two memoirs entitled Western Desert Scramble and Western Desert and Beyond, which are kept, along with Macedonian Medley; 1917\u20131918, in the Imperial War Museum in London.[35] Neither of these three memoirs have seen print yet, although plans exist to publish Macedonian Medley; 1917\u20131918.[2][6]/nShortly after the end of World War II, Stephanides retired from the British Army and reunited with his family in London.[1] In 1947, he and Mary divorced after 17 years of living together.[36]/nIn 1945\u20131961, Stephanides worked as an Assistant Radiologist at St. Thomas' Hospital, Lambeth district of London.[1][3]/nThe publication of Climax in Crete in 1946 was followed by two scientific works: The Microscope and the Practical Principles of Observation (1947), a detailed guide to microscope operation and use, and the seminal A Survey of the Freshwater Biology of Corfu and of Certain Other Regions of Greece (1948).[3] In 2012, Peter G. Sutton, a British biologist and science teacher, would highly praise A Survey, saying, among other things, that it \"laid the foundation for future naturalists to study the aquatic fauna of Corfu\". Sutton was \"astonished by the fact that so many pathways of knowledge... must all proceed through [Stephanides'] original work on the freshwater biology of the island, or risk error\". He also mentioned that while Stephanides' books, scientific collections and most of his notes were destroyed during World War II in air attacks on Corfu town, A Survey was saved by good fortune.[20]/nIn July 1967, Stephanides came to Corfu, helping Gerald Durrell and Christopher Parsons complete the BBC travel documentary The Garden of the Gods.[37] Both Stephanides and Durrell appeared in the film.[2]/nOwing to his meticulousness, excellent knowledge of Corfu and Greece, and strong command of both the English and Greek languages, Stephanides was asked by the Durrell brothers to proofread a number of their books, such as Gerald's My Family and Other Animals[38] or Lawrence's Prospero's Cell,[39] Pope Joan[40] and The Greek Islands.[41]/nAfter he published two collections of his own poems entitled The Golden Face (1965) and The Cities of the Mind (1969), Stephanides was highly praised as a poet.[3] In 1973, he published a third collection of his poems, Worlds in a Crucible.

He traveled to Holland to publish his book De la nature which in time gained notoriety due to the peculiar opinions presented in the book. Upon his return to Paris in 1778 he was appointed royal censor and private secretary to Antoine-Jean Amelot de Chaillou. During the French Revolution he lost all employment and retired to his home, where he lived in relative seclusion, occupied only with family duties.

He eventually returned to the church and signed a recantation of his errors.[1]/nRobinet is one of the many precursors in the history of evolutionary thought who contributed to the process which later crystallized in the work of Charles Darwin. Jean-Baptiste was led from observations into the idea of the transmutation of species and so into a theory of evolution, which in some important respects anticipated modern ideas. In De la nature, published in 1761, Nature was not God, but necessarily and eternally evolved from Divine essence. Creation is the everlasting work of the Deity, who from eternity has been working and smoothly progressing in the manner of Nature. There are no leaps. All things must have come from unity, which has been infinitely diversified. Kingdoms, classes and species are artificial works of man, of which Nature knows nothing. The orangutan was next to man in the scale of being. All the links of Nature's chain may not yet have been discovered, but they would be discovered before long.[2]/nRobinet represented a teleological point of view in his discussions on evolution. All was produced from a divine, pre-existing, and static master-plan. He wrote that in diverse lower animals, Nature advances, groping towards the excellence of the human being. Some imperceptible progress is made at each step, each new production a variation of the primitive design, becoming very responsive after a number of metamorphoses. The development of the human machine had taken a long succession of arrangements, compositions and dissolutions, additions and deletions, alterations, cancellations, and changes of all kinds.[3]/nRobinet, in collaboration with Charles-Joseph Panckoucke were exponents of the Encyclop\u00e9die, and published a supplement to it in four volumes (1776-1777).

[3] In agriculture phosphorus is supplied to the soil through fertilizer to provide nutrients for crops, but nature has trouble cycling the phosphorus, causing it to accumulate in the soil and water.[11] This can lead to negative environmental impacts such as algal blooms, which can have negative impacts on water sources. [11]/nShe studies how phosphorus cycles in soil and water using a variety of techniques ranging from simple extractions to advanced spectroscopic methods. She uses methods such as 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (P-NMR)  and P k-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy (P-XANES). [2][8] These techniques can examine phosphorus forms and concentrations in soils, manure, plants, and snowmelt to help ensure crops are receiving the phosphorus they need while minimizing loss to water. [2] By studying the cycle, researchers can get a complete picture of how phosphorus moves and gain a better understanding of how to manage it more effectively. [12] The goal is to balance what the crop needs to make sure it has just enough, but not too much fertilizer.[12] Although her research has focused on wheat fields, it is being expanded to other crops at sites in Manitoba and Quebec.

His most famous contributions were to the field of chronobiology, where he proposed a model for the endogenous circadian rhythms governing plant photoperiodism. From these contributions, B\u00fcnning is considered a co-founder of chronobiology along with J\u00fcrgen Aschoff and Colin Pittendrigh.[1]/nB\u00fcnning was born on 23 January 1906 in Hamburg, Germany to Heinrich B\u00fcnning and Hermine B\u00fcnning (born Winkler). A teacher of German, English, mathematics, and biology, B\u00fcnning's father was the primary academic influence on Erwin's early life, passing on to Erwin a passion for botany. B\u00fcnning received his primary education in Hamburg from 1912-1925. B\u00fcnning then attended the University of G\u00f6ttingen and the University of Berlin from October 1925-July 1928, where he studied biology, chemistry, physics, and philosophy. B\u00fcnning earned his Doctorate of Philosophy from the University of Berlin in May 1929. During this time, B\u00fcnning married his wife Eleanore; the two would later have three children.[2]/nIn 1930, B\u00fcnning took an assistantship under Otto Renner at the University of Jena, then one of Germany's largest botanical institutes. During the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany in the early 1930s, Renner stood in open opposition to the Nazis, publicly defending Jewish scientists. Similarly, B\u00fcnning was considered a communist sympathizer, a stance likely influenced by B\u00fcnning's father, a Social Democrat opposed to the Nazis. B\u00fcnning's political beliefs created tension between him and some of his students. In response to this tension, B\u00fcnning left Jena for a lectureship at the East Prussian University of K\u00f6nigsberg.[2] In 1936, B\u00fcnning published his model for plant photoperiodism, wherein he proposed that endogenous (internal) circadian rhythms enable plants to measure day length. B\u00fcnning's model of photoperiodism would go largely unnoticed by the scientific community until 1960 when he chaired the 1960 Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Biological Clocks. There, Colin Pittendrigh drew attention to B\u00fcnning's work and named his 1936 model on plant photoperiodism the B\u00fcnning hypothesis.[1][3][4]/nIn 1938, B\u00fcnning spent a year traveling through Java and Sumatra. His observations on the islands resulted in the book Tropische Regenwalder (Tropical Rainforests). Upon his return to Germany in 1939, B\u00fcnning was conscripted in the German military (World War II). Military authorities appointed B\u00fcnning as an associate professor at the University of Strasbourg. After the war, B\u00fcnning became a full professor at the University of Cologne in 1945 before moving to the University of T\u00fcbingen the next year (1946), where he stayed until his retirement in 1971.[2] At T\u00fcbingen, B\u00fcnning entered into the workspace of his role model Wilhelm Pfeffer, the man who postulated in 1875 that the orientation of plants in space changes with the time of day.[5] B\u00fcnning would later publish a biography on Pfeffer.[2]/nOver his career, B\u00fcnning published over 260 papers in the fields of plant physiology and general biology, as well as a very popular textbook on plant physiology. B\u00fcnning suffered by drinking Alzheimer's and died on 4 October 1990 in T\u00fcbingen, Germany, after contracting pneumonia.[2] Following his death, the German newspaper Schw\u00e4bisches Tagblatt described B\u00fcnning as one of the greatest botanists of the 20th century.[1]/nChanges in the positioning of plant leaves over the course of the day were observed as early as the 4th century B.C. by Androsthenes, Alexander the Great\u2019s historian. This phenomenon, however, was not researched further until 1729 when Jean-Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan provided experimental data that mimosa plants close their leaves at night, a movement that persists rhythmically in constant darkness.[5] In 1875, Wilhelm Pfeffer, B\u00fcnning\u2019s role model, put forward that these movements might be controlled by an endogenous biological clock.[5] This theory formed the foundation for B\u00fcnning\u2019s later work.[5]/nPrior to B\u00fcnning\u2019s work, the prevailing hypothesis on circadian rhythms was the \"hourglass\" hypothesis, which postulates that circadian rhythmicity within an organism is entirely driven by the external light-dark cycle and that an organism's \"hourglass\" is reset each day.[6] B\u00fcnning, however, proposed that biological clocks are endogenous and synchronize to daily stimuli. Unlike in the hourglass hypothesis, B\u00fcnning's hypothesis proposes that circadian rhythmicity derives from an interaction between light and a circadian pacemaker, not external stimuli alone.[6] The general premise of B\u00fcnning's hypothesis became a model for circadian time keeping across species off of which many chronobiologists, even into the present, base their models.[7]/nIn the early-1930s, B\u00fcnning proposed that organisms rely on a circadian rhythm of sensitivity to light to measure photoperiod. He demonstrated that plants open and close their leaves and insects eclose according to circadian rhythms, even in continuous light or darkness.[8]  His crossing experiments with bean plants of different periods in 1935 demonstrated that the next generation had periods of intermediate durations, supporting the suggestion that circadian rhythms are heritable.[9]  B\u00fcnning also demonstrated that an artificial photoperiod can induce flowering at inappropriate times, supporting his model of endogenous oscillators entrained to external stimuli. To create artificial photoperiods, B\u00fcnning exposed plants to a light-dark cycle indicative of a specific season, such as the long days and short nights of summer. By entraining the plants to a spring or summer photoperiod, B\u00fcnning was able to induce flowering, even if the actual season were fall or winter.[8][10]  From his results, B\u00fcnning proposed that biological clocks have sensors for both light and dark, and their relationship aids photoperiodic timekeeping.[11]/nHis published works provided key synthesis of existing evidence for biological clocks across species, including plants, flies, and fungi.  His 1958 work, \"The Physiological Clock\", was hailed as a milestone in the field of chronobiology, and his later works on plant physiology helped apply his work on photoperiodism to practical uses.[12]  In 1935 he demonstrated that plants with different inherent periods would become desynchronized in constant conditions.[13] This work provided evidence for the dismissal of the \"Factor X\" hypothesis, which held that circadian rhythms were not endogenous, and were instead reliant on an unknown external stimulus, some \"Factor X.\"[14]/nB\u00fcnning was the pioneer of the \"B\u00fcnning Hypothesis,\" later known as the External Coincidence model. This model proposed a circadian rhythm of photoperiodic photosensitivity in plants. As day length increases with the spring and summer seasons, for example, light hits a plant's photosensitive phase, triggering a physiological or behavioral response. The  B\u00fcnning Hypothesis proposed that light has two functions for an organism:[15]/n1.  Light is the primary Zeitgeber for the synchronization of biological rhythms.[16]/n2.  Light triggers photoinductive responses during certain phases of the circadian cycle.[16]/nB\u00fcnning received many honors in his life both in the field of chronobiology and botany. In 1960, he chaired in the 25th Cold Spring Harbor Symposium, \"Biological Clocks\".\n[4] The next year, B\u00fcnning was elected Corresponding Member of the Botanical Society of America.[17] During his life he was also elected honorary member of the Japanese Botanical Society, the German Botanical Society, the American Society of Plant Physiologists, and the Swiss Botanical Society.[12] He became an elected member of the American Philosophical Society, the Heidelberg Academy for Sciences and Humanities, the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities, and the German Academy of Scientists, Leopoldina. In addition, he was elected a Foreign Associate of the American National Academy of Sciences (1968),[12] Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London, and an Honorary Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences (1986).[2]/nIn 1973  B\u00fcnning won the Charles Reid Barnes Life Membership Award[18] for \"meritorious work in plant biology.\"[19] The Universities of Glasgow (1974), Freiburg (1976), and Erlangen (1977) conferred honorary doctorates on him,[20] as did the University of G\u00f6ttingen[2]\nB\u00fcnning is considered by many to be the father of the field of chronobiology.[2][20] His work on measuring the free-running period of plant rhythms and experiments with cross-breeding strains of plants with different periods aided in the development of that field.[2][20] B\u00fcnning was invited by M. K.

Because of his knowledge he was drafted in 1941 to the German air force as a radio technician.There he met members of the resistance and established a covert radio connection with the Western Allies. In 1944 Reichardt was arrested by the Gestapo and sentenced to death, but escaped, and hid in Berlin until the end of the war./nFrom 1946 to 1950 he studied physics at the Technical University of Berlin. From 1950 he was a doctoral student of Ernst Ruska, studying solid state semiconductors at the Fritz-Haber-Institut of the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, and received his doctorate in 1952. From 1952 to 1954 he was an assistant at the Institute where his teacher Max von Laue was a large influence to his later research. During the war, Reichardt had known Bernhard Hassenstein, who had studied optomotor turning behaviour after the war. Realising these experiments could be formalised in a similar way to electronics experiments, he developed interdisciplinary theories of motion perception. In 1954, Reichardt became a Postdoctoral Fellow at the California Institute of Technology at the invitation of Max Delbr\u00fcck. From 1955 he was assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in G\u00f6ttingen under Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer. In 1958 he founded together with Bernhard Hassenstein and Hans Wenking the cybernetics research group at the Max-Planck-Institute of Biology in T\u00fcbingen.

From joint work (with Bernhard Hassenstein and Hans Wenking) on the visual system of insects and its effect on the flight orientation, the correlation model developed the idea that the visual system of man could be similarly investigated, and led to a general theory of motion perception/nSee Motion perception#First-order motion perceptionIn the 1950s, Reichardt, along with Hassenstein proposed a model of how a neuron receiving input from photoreceptors, which only respond to changes in luminance, could be used to compute motion. Each photoreceptor, responded to a change in luminance at a given location in visual space. Comparison of the phase shift of activity in adjacent cells indicated the direction of movement from one neuron's receptive field to the other.

He was co-discoverer of bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) and experimented with the possibility of phage therapy.[2] D'H\u00e9relle has also been credited for his contributions to the larger concept of applied microbiology.[3]/nd'H\u00e9relle was a  self-taught microbiologist. In 1917 he discovered that \"an invisible antagonist\", when added to bacteria on agar, would produce areas of dead bacteria. The antagonist, now known to be a bacteriophage, could pass through a Chamberland filter. He accurately diluted a suspension of these viruses and discovered that the highest dilutions (lowest virus concentrations), rather than killing all the bacteria, formed discrete areas of dead organisms. Counting these areas and multiplying by the dilution factor allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the original suspension.[4] He realised that he had discovered a new form of virus and later coined the term \"bacteriophage\".[5][6]\nBetween 1918 and 1921 d'Herelle discovered different types of bacteriophages that could infect several other species of bacteria including Vibrio cholerae.[5] Bacteriophages were heralded as a potential treatment for diseases such as typhoid and cholera, but their promise was forgotten with the development of penicillin. Since the early 1970s, bacteria have continued to develop resistance to antibiotics such as penicillin, and this has led to a renewed interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat serious infections.[7]/nF\u00e9lix d'H\u00e9relle's place of birth has been debated, but current research has concluded that he was born in France.[8] F\u00e9lix d'H\u00e9relle's father, Hubert Augustin F\u00e9lix Haerens d'Herelle,[9] died at the age of 30 when F\u00e9lix was six years old. From 7 to 17 years of age, d'H\u00e9relle attended school in Paris, including the Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet and Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand high schools. In the fall of 1891, d'H\u00e9relle traveled to Bonn, Germany where he attended lectures at the University of Bonn for several months. Between the ages of 16 and 24, d'H\u00e9relle traveled extensively via money given by his mother. At 16, he started to travel through western Europe by bike. At 17, after finishing school, he traveled through South America. Afterwards, he continued his travels through Europe, including Turkey, where he, at 20, met his wife, Marie Caire./nAt 24, now the father of a daughter, d'H\u00e9relle and his family moved to Canada. He built a home laboratory and studied microbiology from books and his own experiments. Through the influence of a friend of his late father, he earned a commission from the Canadian government to study the fermentation and distillation of maple syrup to schnapps. His father's friend pointed out that Pasteur \"made a good beginning by studying fermentations, so it might be interesting to you, too.\"[citation needed] He also worked as a medic for a geological expedition, even though he had no medical degree or real experience. Together with his brother, he invested almost all his money in a chocolate factory, which soon went bankrupt.[10][11] During this period, d'Herelle published his first scientific paper, \"De la formation du carbone par les v\u00e9g\u00e9taux\" in the May 1901 issue of Le Naturaliste Canadien. d'H\u00e9relle contended in the paper that the results of his experiments indicated that carbon was a compound, not an element.[12]/nWith his money almost gone and his second daughter born, he took a contract with the government of Guatemala as a bacteriologist at the General Hospital in Guatemala City. Some of his work included organizing defenses against the dread diseases of the time: malaria and yellow fever. He also studied a local fungal infection of coffee plants, and discovered that acidifying the soil could serve as an effective treatment. As a side job, he was asked to find a way to make whiskey from bananas. Life in the rough and dangerous environment of the country was hard on his family, but d'H\u00e9relle, always adventurer at heart, rather enjoyed working close to \"real life\", compared to the sterile environments of a \"civilized\" clinic. He later stated that his scientific path began on this occasion./nIn 1907, he took an offer from the Mexican government to continue his studies on fermentation. He and his family moved to a sisal plantation near M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n. Disease struck at him and his family, but in 1909, he had successfully established a method to produce sisal schnapps./nMachines for mass production of sisal schnapps were ordered in Paris, where he oversaw the machines' construction.  Meanwhile, in his spare time, he worked for free in a laboratory at the Pasteur Institute. He was soon offered the job of running the new Mexican plant, but declined, considering it \"too boring\". He did, however, take the time to attempt stopping a locust plague at the plantation using their own diseases. He extracted bacteria pathogenic to locusts from their guts. This innovative approach to locust plagues anticipated modern biological pest control using Bacillus thuringiensis also known as Bt./nD'H\u00e9relle and his family finally moved to Paris in early 1911, where he worked again as an unpaid assistant in a lab at the Pasteur Institute. He got attention in the scientific community the same year, when the results of his successful attempt to counter the Mexican locust plague with Coccobacillus were published.[3]/nAt the end of the year, restless d'H\u00e9relle was again on the road, this time in Argentina, where he was offered a chance to test these results on a much larger scale. Thus, in 1912 and 1913, he fought the Argentinian locust plagues with coccobacillus experiments. Even though Argentina claimed his success was inconsistent, he himself declared it a full success, and was subsequently invited to other countries to demonstrate the method./nDuring World War I, d'H\u00e9relle and assistants (his wife and daughters among them) produced over 12 million doses of medication for the allied military. At this point in history, medical treatments were primitive, compared to today's standards. The smallpox vaccine, developed by Edward Jenner, was one of the few vaccines available. The primary antibiotic was the arsenic-based salvarsan against syphilis, with severe side effects. Common treatments were based mercury, strychnine, and cocaine. As a result, in 1900, the average life span was 45 years, and World War I did not change that to the better./nIn 1915, British bacteriologist Frederick W. Twort discovered a small agent that infects and kills bacteria, but did not pursue the issue further. Independently, the discovery of \"an invisible, antagonistic microbe of the dysentery bacillus\" by d'H\u00e9relle was announced on 3 September 1917. The isolation of phages by d'Herelle works like this:/nIn early 1919, d'H\u00e9relle isolated phages from chicken feces, successfully treating a plague of chicken typhoid with them.[13] After this successful experiment on chicken, he felt ready for the first trial on humans. The first patient was healed of dysentery using phage therapy in August 1919. Many more followed./nAt the time, none, not even d'H\u00e9relle, knew exactly what a phage was.  D'H\u00e9relle claimed that it was a biological organism that reproduces, somehow feeding off bacteria. Others, the Nobelist Jules Bordet chief among them, theorized that phages were inanimate chemicals, enzymes specifically, that were already present in bacteria, and only trigger the release of similar proteins, killing the bacteria in the process. Due to this uncertainty, and d'H\u00e9relle using phages without much hesitation on humans, his work was under constant attack from many other scientists. It was not until the first phage was observed under an electron microscope by Helmut Ruska in 1939 that its true nature was established./nIn 1920, d'H\u00e9relle travelled to Indochina, pursuing studies of cholera and the plague, from where he returned at the end of the year. D'H\u00e9relle, officially still an unpaid assistant, found himself without a lab; d'H\u00e9relle later claimed this was a result of a quarrel with the assistant director of the Pasteur Institute, Albert Calmette. The biologist Edouard Pozerski had mercy on d'H\u00e9relle and lent him a stool (literally) in his laboratory. In 1921, he managed to publish a monograph, The Bacteriophage: Its Role in Immunity about his works as an official Institute publication, by tricking Calmette. During the following year, doctors and scientists across western Europe took a heightened interest in phage therapy, successfully testing it against a variety of diseases. Since bacteria become resistant against a single phage, d'Herelle suggested using \"phage cocktails\" containing different phage strains./nPhage therapy soon became a boom, and a great hope in medicine. In 1924, 25 January, d'H\u00e9relle received the honorary doctorate of the University of Leiden,[14] as well as the Leeuwenhoek medal, which is only awarded once every ten years. The latter was especially important to him, as his idol Louis Pasteur received the same medal in 1895). The next year, he was nominated eight times for the Nobel prize, though he was never awarded one.[15]/nAfter holding a temporary position at the University of Leiden, d'H\u00e9relle got a position with the Conseil Sanitaire, Maritime et Quarantenaire d'Egypte in Alexandria. The Conseil was put in place to prevent plague and cholera spreading to Europe, with special emphasis on the sanitary concerns about muslim pilgrim groups returning from Mecca and Medina./nD'H\u00e9relle then used phages he collected from plague-infected rats during his 1920 visit to Indochina on human plague patients, with claimed success. The British Empire initiated a vast campaign against plague based on his results./nIn 1926, the British government in India requested anti-plague phages for trials at the Haffkine Institute. The Institute had trouble maintaining the phages. D'H\u00e9relle took unpaid leave from the Quarantine board of Egypt and went to Bombay at his own expense./nThe Haffkine Institute had not used  Martin's medium, which included macerated pig stomach and beef muscle that would offend Muslims and Hindus. The institute's medium used a hydrochloric acid digest of goat tissue. D'Herelle solved the problem by digestion with papaya juice (a source of papain)./nThereafter Lt Col J. Morison, acting director of the Haffkine Institute, became convinced of the effectiveness of phages. Morison wrote to the Government of India to invite d'H\u00e9relle noting that he was \"a consummate technician, and a \"most inspiring worker.\"/nD'H\u00e9relle returned to India to work on cholera. He collaborated with the assistant director of the Haffkine Institute, Major Reginald Malone and M.N. Lahiri, who conducted experiments at the Campbell Hospital in Calcutta. The Campbell Hospial team also worked with Russian bacteriologist Igor Nicholas Asheshov (1891\u20131961), who was working in Patna. Experiments were conducted both in hospitals and in the field./nD'H\u00e9relle and co-workers added phages to wells near camps crowded with many pilgrims. Cases of cholera in the camps were subsequently much lower. The phages were distributed to village head men in Assam and Bengal along with instructions./nHowever, this was a period when Gandhi's Satyagraha was leading to non-cooperation by Indians. Many of the head men did not collaborate and fewer still reported back on the effectiveness. As a result, the experiment was disbanded in 1937.[16]/nD'H\u00e9relle refused a request the following year by the British government to work in India, as he had been offered a professorship at Yale University, which he accepted. Meanwhile, European and US pharmaceutical companies had taken up the production of their own phage medicine, and were promising impossible benefits./nTo counteract this trend, d'Herelle agreed to co-found a French phage-producing company, piping the money back into phage research. All of the companies suffered from production problems, as results from commercial phage medicine were erratic./nProduction problems were most likely due to the attempt to mass-produce phages when they were barely understood. The phages may have been damaged and/or too low in concentration. Another possibility is that incorrect diagnoses led to the use of the irrelevant types of phages that were not adapted to the host bacteria of interest. Many studies on the proposed healing effects of phages were also poorly designed and conducted./nThis situation led to many influential members of the scientific community turning against d'H\u00e9relle. The problems may have been compounded by d'H\u00e9relle's reputed bad temper, which was said to have made enemies of several other scientists./nIn about 1934, d'H\u00e9relle went to Tbilisi, Georgia. He was welcomed to the Soviet Union as a hero, bringing knowledge of salvation from diseases ravaging the eastern states. He was even awarded with an honorary doctorate from Tbilisi State University in 1934.[17]/nD'H\u00e9relle may have accepted Stalin's invitation for two reasons. Firstly, he was said to be enamored with communism.\nSecondly, d'H\u00e9relle was happy to be working with his friend, Professor George Eliava, founder of the Tbilisi Institute, in 1923.[18] Eliava had become friendly with d'Herelle during a visit to the Pasteur Institute in Paris in 1926, and had used that occasion to learn about phages./nD'H\u00e9relle worked at the Tbilisi Institute off and on for about a year. He even dedicated one of his books to Comrade Stalin: \"The Bacteriophage and the Phenomenon of Recovery,\" written and published in Tbilisi in 1935. Indeed, d'H\u00e9relle may have planned to take up permanent residence in  Tbilisi, as he had started to build a cottage on the grounds of the institute. The same building would later house the Georgian headquarters of the NKVD.[19]/nFortunes turned abruptly for d'H\u00e9relle when Eliava fell in love with the same woman as Lavrenty Beria, head of the secret police. Eliava was executed and denounced as an enemy of the people during one of Stalin's purges. As a result, d'H\u00e9relle fled Tbilisi, never to return. His book was banned from distribution./nThe Georgian period in d'H\u00e9relle's career has been investigated by author and medical scientist David Shrayer-Petrov./nPhage therapy boomed, despite all problems, driven by the military on both sides in an effort to keep the troops safe, at least from infections. D'H\u00e9relle could not really enjoy this development; he was kept under house arrest by the German \"Wehrmacht\" in Vichy, France. He used the time to write his book \"The Value of Experiment\", as well as his memoirs, the latter being 800 pages in length./nAfter D-Day, the new antibiotic drug penicillin became public knowledge and found its way into the hospitals in the west. As it was more reliable and easier to use than phage therapy, it soon became the method of choice, despite  side effects and problems with resistant bacteria. Phage therapy remained a common treatment in the states of the Soviet Union, though, until its deconstruction./nF\u00e9lix d'H\u00e9relle was stricken with pancreatic cancer and died a forgotten man in Paris in 1949. He was buried in Saint-Mards-en-Othe in the department of the Aube in France.[20]/nIn the 1960s F\u00e9lix d'H\u00e9relle's name appeared on a list published by the Nobel Foundation of scientists who had been worthy of receiving the Nobel Prize but did not, for one reason or another. D'Herelle was nominated for the prize ten times.[21]/nHowever, France has not completely forgotten F\u00e9lix d'H\u00e9relle. There is an avenue that bears his name in the 16th arrondissement in Paris./nD'H\u00e9relle became widely known for his imaginative approaches to important problems in theoretical, as well as applied, microbiology. At the same time, he was widely reviled for his self-advertisement, his exaggerated claims of success and his sharp financial practices. He also had a talent for making enemies among powerful senior scientists./nD'H\u00e9relle's main legacy lies in the use of phage in the molecular revolution in biology. Max Delbr\u00fcck and the \"phage group\" used bacteriophages to make the discoveries that led to the origins of molecular biology. Much of the initial work on the nature of genetic expression and its regulation was performed with bacteriophages by Francois Jacob, Andre Lwoff and Jacques Monod. In fact, immediately before his studies of the structure of DNA, James Watson had earned his Ph.D. by working on a bacteriophage-related project in Salvador Luria's laboratory. A more detailed account of the use of phage in major biological discoveries can be found on the page, bacteriophage./nAs one of the earliest applied microbiologists, d'H\u00e9relle's microbe-centered worldview has been noted for its prescience, since microbes are playing increasingly important roles in bioremediation, microbial fuel cells, gene therapy, and other areas with relevance to human well-being.[3]/nThe family Herelleviridae, a group of bacteriophages in order Caudovirales, was named in honor of F\u00e9lix d'H\u00e9relle./nThe novel Arrowsmith written by Sinclair Lewis with scientific help from Paul de Kruif was based to a certain extent on the life of d'H\u00e9relle.

They asked her about the vials they had confiscated in 2016, and Jazayeri said that she had agreed to transport the growth factors to Soleimani as a favor, without knowing that this was prohibited. According to court documents, she also told the agents that the proteins were to be used for \"medical purposes such as stem cell research, cancer research, and transplantation\"./nEight months later, on 24 October 2018, a federal grand jury indicted all three scientists under seal \u2014 or behind closed doors \u2014 on two counts of conspiring to export goods to Iran without authorization.

A second edition was published in 1999.[12]/nHis ever-expanding interests led him into plant population genetics, a field that he essentially founded.  His particular interest was in the population genetics of Inbreeding species, and included wild plants such as Collinsia, Avena barbata and Avena fatua.  His interest in inbreeding species probably stemmed from his interactions with Ledyard Stebbins, who was also at U.C. Davis, and had predicted that wild inbreeding plant populations should be devoid of genetic variation. As a plant breeder who had done selection on inbreeding species in cultivated plants, Allard knew that there was ample genetic variation within \"pure lines.\" It is easy to see how he would have become intrigued with inbreeding wild species. And indeed starting in the early 1960s he worked with experimental populations of wheat, barley, and lima beans as well as the wild plants Collinsia, Avena barbata, and Avena fatua investigating a wide variety of issues important to the population genetics of inbreeding species.  He published numerous foundational papers on the effects of mating systems, selection, gene-environment interactions, linkage disequilibrium, and genetic drift on the genetic variation of inbreeding plant populations.[13][14][15][16][17][18][19]/nStarting at the latter part of the 1960s and to the end of his career, Allard and co-workers focused primarily in a new area for his lab, that of ecological genetics, particularly in the plant Avena barbata. This work was greatly assisted at the end of the 1960s and throughout the 1970s and 1980s by the use of molecular markers known as isozymes combined with traditional quantitative genetics and morphological single-marker traits[20][21][22][23]\n[24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34] as well as more advanced molecular techniques as these became available in the 1980s and 1990s and were applied to Avena barbata[35] and other species such as wild and cultivated barley[36][37] and pines.[38]/nAn over-riding theme of Allard's lifetime work was the demonstration of \"favorable epistatic combinations of alleles of different loci\", or multilocus gene complexes in wild and cultivated plants that were assembled in and adapted to specific habitats. To illustrate this theme his last two papers focused on two in-breeding species (the slender wild oat Avena barbata and barley Hordeum vulgare) and one outcrossing species, corn (Zea maize).[39][40]", "10953520": "Richard L.

Her first was in the 1950s and 1960s when she pioneered the field of cytoplasmic genetics by discovering transmission of genetic traits through chloroplast DNA,[2] the first known example of genetics not involving the cell nucleus. The academic community did not acknowledge the significance of her contribution until after the second wave of feminism in the 1970s.[3] Her second career began in the early 1970s and was in cancer genetics; she proposed and investigated the roles of tumor suppressor genes./nSager was born on February 7, 1918, in Chicago, Illinois, one of three daughters of Leon B. Sager, an advertising executive, and Deborah Borovik Sager. Following Sager's birth, her mother died from the influenza epidemic of the time. Sager and her sisters, Esther and Naomi, were raised by their step mother Hannah. At 16 Sager had graduated from New Trier High school. After, she attended the University of Chicago and earned her S.B. in mammalian physiology in 1938. Following, she attended the Rutgers University and received her M.S. in plant physiology in 1944.[4] During World War II Sager had left academia to work as a secretary and an apple farmer. Following the war Sager had received her Ph.D. in maize genetics from Columbia University under Marcus M. Rhodes.[5] In 1944 she married Seymour Melman; in 1973 she married Arthur Pardee.

Unlike what would be expected if the trait were passed down following traditional Mendelian inheritance, she found that the offspring only showed the streptomycin sensitivity/resistance trait of one of their parents.[4] This research provided evidence for non-Mendelian uniparental inheritance; it also showed that there are multiple independent genetic systems in Chlamydomonas.[2] She found further evidence when she mapped the streptomycin sensitivity/resistance trait and found a stable, nonchromosomal inheritance system that she proposed may have arisen before chromosomes.[4] She was the first person to publish extensive genetic mapping of a cellular organelle.[6]/nShe joined Columbia University's zoology department as a research associate in 1955, supported by funding from the United States Public Health Service and the National Science Foundation.[7] She was promoted to senior research associate in the early 1960s, but she had difficulty obtaining a faculty position due to initial skepticism surrounding cytoplasmic inheritance from the scientific community, as well as gender discrimination.[7][8] It wasn't until 1966, 18 years after receiving her doctorate, that Hunter College invited her to be a professor of biology.[2]/nSager changed her research focus to cancer biology in the 1970s, with a specific focus on breast cancer, and spent time researching at London's Imperial Cancer Research Fund Laboratory from 1972 to 1973, where she met her future husband, Arthur Pardee.[6] In 1975 she joined the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics at Harvard Medical School as a professor of cellular genetics, where she served as chief of the Division of Cancer Genetics at the affiliated Dana\u2013Farber Cancer Institute. Her research there focused on the genetic and molecular causes of cancer, including investigation of the roles of tumor suppressor genes, DNA methylation, and chromosomal instability in tumor growth and spread.[7] Sager was one of the first people to emphasize the importance of such genes.[6] She identified over 100 potential tumor suppressor genes and performed extensive research into a specific tumor suppressor gene called maspin (mammary serine protease inhibitor)[6] She developed cell culture methods to study normal and cancerous human and other mammalian cells in the laboratory and pioneered the research into \"expression genetics,\" the study of altered gene expression.[5]/nFor more than half a century she demonstrated vision, insight and determination to develop novel scientific concepts in the face of established dogmas.

He served in the US Army during the Korean War and retired as a major after twenty-three years of reserve service in the military. He married Carolyn Cain in 1952, and they had three daughters, Marla, Suzanne, and Carol.[1]/nBeginning in 1958, Traxler taught at the University of Southwest Louisiana at Lafayette, Louisiana for thirteen years, earning a distinguished faculty award from the university in 1965 for his research on petroleum degradation.[2]  He joined the faculty of the University of Rhode Island in 1971 as a professor of microbiology, founding the biotechnology program at the university in 1986.[3]  Traxler had been chairman of two different departments at the University of Rhode Island: Plant Pathology and Entomology, and Food Science and Nutrition, and he was a member of American Society for Microbiology and the Society for Industrial Microbiology. He was also active in the local community in Kingston serving as president of the Tavern Hall Club in 1995. He retired from the university in 1998, and died on 5 December 2010 at his home in South Kingstown, Rhode Island.[1]/nTraxler was the author of over 100 publications primarily on the microbiology of petroleum degradation and food microbiology. His work has been important in the development of technologies to remediate oil spills.

He is remembered for the numerous expeditions he conducted for the New York Zoological Society, his deep dives in the Bathysphere, and his prolific scientific writing for academic and popular audiences./nBorn in Brooklyn, New York and raised in East Orange, New Jersey, Beebe left college before obtaining a degree to work at the then newly opened New York Zoological Park, where he was given the duty of caring for the zoo's birds. He quickly distinguished himself in his work for the zoo, first with his skill in designing habitats for its bird population, and soon also with a series of research expeditions of increasing length, including an expedition around the world to document the world's pheasants. These expeditions formed the basis for a large quantity of writing for both popular and academic audiences, including an account of his pheasant expedition titled A Monograph of the Pheasants and published in four volumes from 1918 to 1922. In recognition of the research conducted on his expeditions, he was granted honorary doctorates from Tufts and Colgate University./nDuring the course of his expeditions, Beebe gradually developed an interest in marine biology, ultimately leading to his 1930s dives in the Bathysphere, along with its inventor, Otis Barton, off the coast of Bermuda. This was the first time a biologist observed deep-sea animals in their native environment and set several successive records for the deepest dive ever performed by a human, the deepest of which stood until it was broken by Barton 15 years later. Following his Bathysphere dives, Beebe returned to the tropics and began to focus his study on the behavior of insects. In 1949, he founded a tropical research station in Trinidad and Tobago which he named Simla, and which remains in operation as part of the Asa Wright Nature Centre. Beebe's research at Simla continued until his death from pneumonia in 1962 at the age of 84./nWilliam Beebe is regarded as one of the founders of the field of ecology, as well as one of the early 20th century's major advocates of conservation. He is also remembered for several theories he proposed about avian evolution which are now regarded as having been ahead of their time, particularly his 1915 hypothesis that the evolution of bird flight passed through a four-winged or \"Tetrapteryx\" stage, which has been supported by the 2003 discovery of Microraptor gui./nCharles William Beebe was born in Brooklyn, New York, son of the newspaper executive Charles Beebe. Although some sources have described him as an only child,[3] he had a younger brother named John who died in infancy.[4][5] Early in his life, his family moved to East Orange, New Jersey, where he began to acquire both his fascination with the natural world and his tendency to record everything he saw.[6][7] The American Museum of Natural History, which opened the year that Beebe was born, fostered Beebe's love of nature and was an early influence on him.[8]/nIn September 1891, Beebe began attending East Orange High School.[9] Although Beebe did not formally drop his first name \"Charles\" until 1915, before attending high school he was already commonly known as \"William Beebe\", as he would be known from this point onward.[10][11] During his high school years Beebe developed an interest in collecting animals, particularly after receiving his first gun at the age of sixteen, and trained himself in taxidermy to preserve them. When he was unable to collect a specimen for himself, he often obtained it from a supply house known as Lattin's, or by trading with other collectors.[12] Beebe's first article was published while he was still in high school, a description of a bird called a brown creeper, which appeared in the January 1895 issue of the magazine Harper's Young People.[13]/nIn 1896, Beebe was accepted with advanced placement to Columbia University.[14] While attending university, Beebe frequently split his time between the university and the American Museum of Natural history, many of whose researchers were also professors at Columbia.[15] At Columbia he studied under Henry Fairfield Osborn, and developed a close relationship with him which would endure until Osborn's death in 1935.[16]/nWhile attending Columbia, Beebe persuaded his professors to sponsor him and several fellow students taking research trips to Nova Scotia, where he continued his hobby of collecting, as well as attempting to photograph difficult-to-observe scenes of birds and other animals. Several of Beebe's photographs from these expeditions were purchased by Columbia professors to use as slides during their lectures. During these trips, Beebe also developed an interest in dredging, the practice of using nets to haul up animals that lived deep underwater and attempting to study them before they died or disintegrated.[17] Beebe never applied to receive a degree from Columbia,[18] although years later he was granted honorary doctorates from both Tufts and Colgate University.[19]/nIn November 1897, Frank Chapman sponsored Beebe to become an associate member of the American Ornithologists' Union, and the following month Beebe gave his first professional lecture on ornithology to a society called Uncle Clarence's Bergen Point Culture Club.[20] In 1899, although he had completed all of the required courses for a degree in science from Columbia except for mathematics, he decided to forgo his studies in favor of an invitation from Osborn to work at the New York Zoological Park which was about to open.[2] Several factors contributed to this decision, including both excitement at being part of the zoo, and the sense that his studies were putting too much of a strain on his family's finances.[21]/nOsborn appointed Beebe to the position of assistant curator of ornithology.[3][22] As assistant curator, one of his principal jobs was to breed and rear the zoo's birds in order to sustain their population.[23] Beebe placed much importance on the birds being given as much space as possible, and proposed the building of a \"flying cage\" the size of a football field.[24] This was eventually built, although at less than half the size that Beebe had originally requested.[25] While Beebe's flying cage was criticized as being based on an inaccurate understanding of birds' needs, it ultimately proved very successful.[26]/nIn 1901, Beebe returned to Nova Scotia on his first expedition for the zoo, intending to collect marine animals by searching tide pools and with additional dredging.[27] The following year he was promoted from assistant curator to the rank of a full curator, a post he held until 1918.[28] He then went on to serve as an honorary curator from 1919 to 1962./nOn August 6, 1902, Beebe was married to Mary Blair Rice, better known by her pen name Blair Niles.[29][30] Blair subsequently accompanied Beebe on several of his expeditions, and as a writer herself, frequently assisted Beebe with his own writing.[31][32] Beebe and Blair regarded their honeymoon, another trip to Nova Scotia, as a further opportunity for collecting.[33]/nThe following February, Beebe, and Blair went on an expedition to the Florida Keys, because Beebe was suffering from a throat infection and the zoo believed that the warm climate would be beneficial to his health. This expedition was Beebe's introduction to the tropics, with which he developed a long-standing fascination.[34] In July 1903, at the request of a lawyer named Louis Whealton whom the zoo's director William Temple Hornaday regarded as a potential donor to the zoo, Beebe and Blair went on another expedition to Virginia's Barrier Islands. Although it was intended as an expedition for the zoo, Beebe described it as \"our third honeymoon this year\".[35]/nBy the end of 1903, at the age of 26, Beebe had published more than thirty-four articles and photographs in the past year. For his contributions to science, he was elected a fellow in the American Association for the Advancement of Science.[36]/nIn December 1903, to avert another bout of Beebe's throat ailment, Hornaday sent him on an expedition to Mexico which would last until the following April.[37] Since Mexico was still largely unstable at this point, he and Blair traveled on horseback and lived mostly in tents, and both carried revolvers for self-protection.[38] Although the purpose of the expedition was to discover, identify and collect Mexico's birds,[39] it has also been described as yet another honeymoon between him and Blair.[31][40] Beebe's first book, titled Two Bird Lovers in Mexico, was an account of this expedition. The last chapter was written by Blair and was an explanation of how to plan and execute a vacation in the wilderness.[41][42] The book was enthusiastically well received.[43]/nBeebe's second book, The Bird, Its Form and Function, was published in 1906.[44] This book was a reworking of a manuscript that Beebe had submitted to Henry Holt in 1902, but which Holt had asked him to expand into a major work on birds.[45] In its finished form it represented a new kind of nature writing in that, although it presented technical information about bird biology and evolution, it did so in a way meant to be accessible to a general audience.[46][47] It also represented an important turning point for Beebe, because in contrast to his youthful fascination with adding animals to his collection, in this book he was beginning to emphasize the importance of wildlife conservation.[47] Regarding the killing of animals for the sole purpose of collecting, the book states:/nAnd the next time you raise your gun to needlessly take a feathered life, think of the marvelous little engine which your lead will stifle forever; lower your weapon and look into the clear bright eyes of the bird whose body equals yours in physical perfection, and whose tiny brain can generate a sympathy, a love for its mate, which is sincerity and unselfishness suffers little when compared with human affection.[48]/nAlthough Beebe continued to shoot animals when it was necessary for examining them scientifically, he no longer regarded adding to a collection as a valid reason to take a life.[49] In 1906 Beebe presented his own collection, which had grown to 990 specimens during his earlier years as a collector, as a gift to the zoo for educational and research purposes. For this gift, he was made a life member of the New York Zoological Society. The same year, he was also elected a fellow of the New York Academy of Sciences.[50]/nIn 1907, the journal Zoologica was founded by Osborn and Hornaday specifically as a place for Beebe to publish his research. The first issue of the journal contained twenty papers, ten of which were written by Beebe, and two more of which were jointly written by him and Lee Saunders Crandall, the zoo's assistant curator of birds.[51] The following year Beebe received a promotion from the Zoological Society, placing him on equal footing with the research scientists at the Museum of Natural History. This promotion explicitly granted him two months off each year, for further research expeditions.[52] The first expedition conducted under his new privileges, beginning in February 1908, took him to Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela to research birds and insects. During this expedition Beebe captured 40 live birds for the zoo, belonging to 14 different species.[53][54]/nAt this point in his life, Beebe was forming a close friendship with then-president Theodore Roosevelt, which would last until Roosevelt's death in 1919. Beebe admired Roosevelt's skill as a field naturalist as well as his advocacy of conservation, and Roosevelt's fame made his support highly valuable in Beebe's scientific endeavors. Roosevelt in turn admired Beebe's writing and his respect for the natural world.[55][56] Roosevelt frequently provided praise for Beebe's books, and went on to write introductions to Beebe's books Tropical Wild Life and Jungle Peace.[57]/nIn February 1909, Beebe and Blair traveled to British Guiana, in the hope that with Roosevelt's support, it might be possible to establish a permanent field research station there.[58] Another goal of this expedition was to find and capture a hoatzin, a bird whose clawed wings caused it to be considered an important link in the evolution of birds from reptiles. Beebe made extensive documentation of hoatzin behavior through field glasses, but their plans to capture one were foiled when they had to return home early due to Blair breaking her wrist. Despite their failure to obtain their most sought-after prize, the expedition still returned with 280 live birds of 51 species, 33 of which were new to the zoo, although several of these died or escaped during the long trip back to New York.[59][60] Beebe summarized this expedition in his book Our Search for a Wilderness, which was enthusiastically well-reviewed.[61]/nIn December 1909, businessman and philanthropist Anthony R. Kuser proposed to the zoo that Beebe be allowed to go on a voyage around the world to document the world's pheasants, which would be financed by Kuser.[62] Hornaday strongly objected to this proposal, describing Kuser as an \"evil genius\" who was attempting to steal Beebe away from his duties at the zoo.[63] However, the zoo ultimately decided in Kuser's favor, partly because the scientific papers produced by Beebe's trip to Guiana had been beneficial to the zoo's reputation.[64] Hornaday appointed Crandall as the zoo's acting curator of birds, giving him the duty of caring for its birds in Beebe's absence.[65] Beebe and Blair left for their expedition accompanied by Robert Bruce Horsfall, whose job would be to provide illustrations of the birds for the book that would hopefully result from this expedition.[66]/nAfter crossing the Atlantic Ocean on the RMS Lusitania to London, where they gathered the supplies they would need for their expedition, Beebe and his team traveled across the Mediterranean Sea to Egypt, through the Suez Canal, and across the Indian Ocean to Ceylon, where they began their task of documenting the native wildfowl.[67] From Ceylon they traveled to Calcutta, with the goal of capturing the species of pheasants which live only in the Himalayas.[68] By this point Beebe was beginning to conflict with Horsfall, who was unaccustomed to such expeditions.[69] After Beebe had finished his documentation in the eastern part of the range, Horsfall refused to accompany Beebe in the western part of the range, causing Beebe to leave him in the town of Jorepokhri and continue his work in the Western Himalayas without him.[70] Horsfall rejoined them in Calcutta, from which they sailed to Indonesia.[71] The next ship took them to Singapore, where Beebe established a base of operations for the next stage of his expedition.[72]/nThe expedition's next destination was Sarawak, on the island of Borneo.[71] By the time they left Sarawak, the conflict between Beebe and Horsfall had grown to such a degree that Beebe decided Horsfall was endangering the expedition and must be sent home. In response to Beebe's dismissal, Horsfall retorted that he had been ill-treated by Beebe from the beginning of the expedition and that his subsequent actions had been for the express purpose of revenge.[73] Continuing without Horsfall, Beebe and Blair traveled to Batavia in Java,[74] to the island of Madura just to the north, and to Belitung between Borneo and Sumatra.[72]/nFinished in Java, Beebe and his crew sailed north from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur to begin exploring Malaya.[72] After Malaya, the next portion of their expedition took them to Burma, where they arrived in Rangoon and traveled by rail to Myitkyina.[75] In Burma Beebe succumbed temporarily to a bout of depression, and it was several days before he was able to resume working or continue the expedition.[76] He attributed his recovery to the pile of penny dreadful novels he discovered in his bungalow at Pungatong, which he then read constantly for the next few days.[77][78]/nThe last portion of Beebe's journey took him to China, from which they made an unplanned visit to Japan to escape a riot as well as a surge of bubonic plague.[79] When the plague and riots had subsided, Beebe returned to China to document the local pheasant species, then made a second visit to Japan to study pheasants kept in the Imperial Preserves there. In Japan, Beebe was given two cranes by the Imperial Household in exchange for a pair of swans, which were unknown in Japan.[80]/nHis expedition was completed after a total of 17 months, Beebe and Blair crossed the Pacific to San Francisco, then crossed the United States to return to their home in New York. Their expedition had obtained live or stuffed specimens of nearly all the pheasants he had sought, and also produced extensive notes about their behavior.[81] Some of these pheasants, such as Sclater's impeyan or Himalayan monal, had never before been seen in the wild by Americans or Europeans.[82] Beebe's observations of sexual dimorphism in pheasants during this expedition led him to become the first biologist to correctly understand the mechanism by which this aspect of sexual selection operates.[83] based on his observations he also proposed a new evolutionary model of pheasant ancestry, involving a period of rapid diversification followed by more typical and gradual changes. Although this evolutionary model is now taken for granted, in William Beebe's time it was a novel idea.[84]/nIn January 1913, Blair left Beebe for Reno intending to divorce him, since at this time in history it was easier to obtain a divorce in Reno than in most other areas of the United States. The divorce was granted on August 29, 1913, after Blair had spent the minimum requirement of six months as a resident in Reno.[85] Obtaining a divorce in Reno required a person to demonstrate that their spouse had committed either adultery or extreme cruelty; Blair's complaint accused Beebe of the latter,[86] claiming that during the pheasant expedition he had threatened to commit suicide by \"throwing himself in the river, shooting himself through the roof of the mouth with a revolver, and by cutting his throat with a razor.\"[87] Beebe made very little effort to contest the divorce and did not appear in court to offer any testimony.[31][87] Although newspapers at the time reported Blair's accusations uncritically, with headlines such as \"Naturalist was cruel\",[88] modern biographers consider it more likely that Blair resorted to hyperbole to make a divorce case.[31] A week after her divorce from Beebe, Blair was remarried to their next-door neighbor Robin Niles, suggesting that the true reason for the divorce may have been cuckoldry.[89] On the other hand, some biographers have suggested that Beebe suffered a nervous breakdown during the expedition and that he may have contributed his own part to Blair's alienation.[90]/nBlair's departure came as a shock to Beebe, and he was severely depressed for more than a year afterward.[89] Despite her assistance during the pheasant expedition, Beebe excised any mention of her from the monograph he was preparing based on the data gathered during it.[91]/nBy the end of 1914, Beebe's pheasant monograph was essentially complete in the manuscript. While the text was written by Beebe, the illustrations were provided by several artists: Robert Bruce Horsfall, who had accompanied Beebe on the expedition, painted the environmental scenes for the illustrations' backgrounds, while the pheasants themselves were painted by other artists including George Edward Lodge, Charles R. Knight, and Louis Agassiz Fuertes.[92] Due to the elaborate nature of the book's color artwork, no American publisher was considered capable of reproducing it. The publisher which Beebe chose for his work was George Witherby and Sons of London, as a result of their success publishing the artwork of John James Audubon.[93] The reproduction of the illustrations themselves was to be handled by several companies in Germany and Austria. Reproductions of the illustrations were in the process of being printed when World War I began, holding up the completion of the project for the next four years.[94]/nBeebe undertook an expedition to Brazil in 1915, to capture more birds for the zoo.[95] This expedition was an important turning point for Beebe in several ways. Beebe had far more field experience than either of the two others accompanying him on the expedition, G. Inness Hartley and Herbert Atkins, making this his introduction to the role of a mentor.[96] During this expedition, Beebe was also amazed to discover the number and variety of organisms living under a single tree and pioneered the method of studying a small area of wilderness for an extended amount of time. This expedition marked the beginning of a shift for Beebe from ornithology to the study of tropical ecosystems.[95]/nIn 1916, Beebe traveled to Georgetown in pursuit of his earlier goal of establishing a permanent field research station in Guiana. After following several leads which came to nothing, his goal was realized when George Withers, who owned a rubber plantation on the Mazaruni River, offered him the use of a large house on his property for this purpose.[97] Soon after Beebe and his researchers moved into the plantation house, which was known by the name of Kalacoon, they were paid a visit by Theodore Roosevelt and his family. Roosevelt subsequently wrote an article about the station for Scribner's Magazine, which helped to build public support for the station.[98]/nThe establishment of the Kalacoon research station enabled Beebe to research the ecology of the surrounding jungle in far more detail than had been possible during his earlier expeditions. Using Kalacoon as his base of operations, Beebe performed a novel type of study: methodically dissecting a small area of jungle, and all of the animals which inhabit it, from the top of the canopy to below the ground. In a second study, Beebe performed the same task for a much larger area of jungle, approximately a quarter-mile (0.4\u00a0 km) square.[99] During his first season at Kalacoon in 1916, Beebe brought back 300 living specimens for the zoo. This time he succeeded at capturing a hoatzin, the bird that he had narrowly missed during his earlier trip to Guiana, although he was unable to keep it alive for the zoo during the trip back to New York./nBeebe summarized his discoveries at Kalacoon in his 1917 book Tropical Wild Life in British Guiana, which inspired many other researchers to plan trips to Kalacoon or to establish their own field research stations of the type that Beebe had pioneered.[100]/nBeebe was eager to serve in World War I, but at 40 he was considered too old for regular service. With Roosevelt's help, he secured a post-training American pilot for a flight squadron on Long Island. His training work was halted when, veering to avoid a photographer who had run in front of his airplane as he landed, he crashed on landing and severely injured his right wrist.[101] During a second trip to Kalacoon while his wrist healed, Beebe was further devastated to discover that due to wartime demand for rubber, the entire jungle surrounding the house had been clear-cut to make room for rubber trees. Since the purpose of Kalacoon station had been to study the jungle, the jungle's destruction left Beebe with no choice but to close the station and return with its supplies to New York.[102][103] Combined with his earlier loss of Blair, the effect of losing Kalacoon plunged Beebe into depression. This did not go unnoticed by Beebe's mentor Osborn, who expressed concern about it in a letter to Madison Grant, writing \"I find that he is worried and far from well. [...] Without telling him so, we must take care of him.\"[104]/nIn October 1917, Beebe had his opportunity to serve in the war. With the help of a letter of recommendation from Roosevelt, he was given the duty of flying aerial photography planes over German gun emplacements. He also spent time in trenches and accompanied a Canadian Indian platoon on a night raid.[105] Beebe subsequently wrote several articles describing his war experience for Scribner's Magazine and Atlantic Monthly.[104] Beebe generally did not make the exact nature of his military service clear in his writings about it, although he expressed his general dismay at the realities of the war.[106] The best-known of these accounts is provided by the opening paragraph of his 1918 book Jungle Peace:/nAfter creeping through slime-filled holes beneath the shrieking of swift metal; after splashing one's plane through companionable clouds three miles above the little jagged, hero-filled ditches, and dodging other sudden-born clouds of nauseous fumes and blasting heart of steel; after these, one craves thoughts of comfortable hens, sweet apple orchards, or the ineffable themes of opera. And when nerves have cried for a time \"enough\" and an unsteady hand threatens to turn a joystick into a signpost to Charon, the mind seeks amelioration\u2014some symbol of worthy content and peace\u2014and for my part, I turn with all desire to the jungles of the tropics.[107]/nBeebe's position in the Zoological Society changed in 1918: He was given the title of Honorary Curator of Birds and was made the director of the newly created Department of Tropical Research.[103] With his new position, Beebe no longer had the duty of caring for the zoo's animals, freeing him to devote himself fully to his writing and research.[108] Beebe's duties as curator were passed to Lee Crandall, the former Assistant Curator who had worked under Beebe,[109] although Crandall continued to rely on Beebe for help treating illness in birds, and caring for the exotic birds brought back from Beebe's expeditions.[108]/nThe first volume of Beebe's pheasant monograph was published that fall, although the ongoing war made it unclear when the remaining three volumes would be published. The first volume was highly praised by reviewers, and received the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1918.[104][110] In January 1919 Roosevelt, who was severely ill by this point, wrote to Beebe from his hospital bed congratulating Beebe on the publication of his monograph. His letter of congratulation to Beebe was the last letter that Roosevelt wrote before his death.[111][112] Volume II of the monograph was published in 1921, and volumes III and IV were published in 1922.[113] The completed work, titled A Monograph of the Pheasants, has been considered by some reviewers to be possibly the greatest ornithological monograph of the twentieth century.[114]/nIn 1919, Osborn helped secure Beebe a new research station in Guiana to replace Kalacoon: Beebe was offered Kartabo Point, an outpost of a New York-based mining corporation.[115] Beebe was enthusiastic about the new station, and it proved very successful for conducting the same detailed analyses of wildlife within small areas that had been performed at Kalacoon.[116] At Kartabo Beebe discovered the phenomenon known as an ant mill, a column of ants following itself in an endless loop until nearly all of them died of exhaustion.[117][118]/nBeebe was eager to undertake an expedition to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, intending to obtain more detailed data in support of evolution than Charles Darwin had been able to collect in his earlier visit. In 1923, Harrison Williams agreed to finance such an expedition, and Beebe was provided with a 250-foot (76\u00a0m) steam yacht called the Noma for this purpose along with a support crew. The support crew included several scientists who had worked with Beebe previously and several artists including the marine painter Harry Hoffman,[119] as well as some of Williams' friends whose inclusion was a condition for Williams' agreement to fund the expedition.[120] Passing through the Sargasso Sea on the way to the Gal\u00e1pagos, Beebe was fascinated by the diversity of life that could be found in the sargassum weed floating on the surface and spent several days scooping the weed from the water to examine the creatures that lived in it.[121]/nBeebe's first expedition to the Gal\u00e1pagos lasted twenty days, broken into two ten-day periods, between which the Noma was forced to return to Panama for fresh water and coal.[122] During this expedition he documented the unique ways that animals that inhabit the Gal\u00e1pagos have evolved in response to the absence of predators. The Gal\u00e1pagos animals generally showed no fear of humans, causing the team to have a high degree of success at capturing live specimens for the zoo.[123] Beebe also discovered a previously unknown bay on Genovesa Island (also known as Tower Island) in the Gal\u00e1pagos, which he named Darwin Bay, and documented the diversity of animal life that inhabited it.[124] During the return to New York from this expedition, Beebe continued to dredge animals from the sea, using a pair of new devices he had devised to assist himself with this: a \"pulpit\", an iron cage affixed to the bow of the ship that enabled its occupant to examine the surface of the sea more closely; and a \"boom walk\", a 30-foot (9.1\u00a0m) boom jutting from the side of the ship from which he suspended himself.[125] The book in which Beebe summarized this expedition, titled Gal\u00e1pagos: World's End, was an instant best-seller and remained on the New York Times top ten list for several months.[126]/nIn 1924, Beebe went on another expedition to his Guiana research station of Kartabo, intending to continue the detailed documentation of the tropical ecosystem that he had begun at Kalacoon. The paper which finally resulted from this study was published in Zoologica in 1925 and was the first study of its kind in the developing field of tropical ecology.[127] Beebe continued to battle depression during this trip to Kartabo, both over his earlier loss of Blair, and over the death of his mother Nettie, who had died shortly before the beginning of the expedition.[128]/nDespite his ongoing research in Guiana, what Beebe desired most was to return to the Gal\u00e1pagos, this time with a properly fitted-out scientific research vessel that possessed the ability to dredge animals from beneath the ocean.[129] In 1925, Beebe set out on a second Gal\u00e1pagos expedition, The Arcturus Oceanographic Expedition,[130][131] backed by Williams and several other donors.[132] His ship for this expedition was the steam yacht Arcturus, presented to the New York Zoological Society by Executive Committee member Henry D. Whiton. Arcturus, at 280\u00a0ft (85.3\u00a0m), was considerably larger than the Noma and was capable of being at sea for extended periods of time.[133] The Arcturus was outfitted with Beebe's pulpit and boom walk from the Noma, as well as cages and tanks for live animals, chemicals and vials to preserve dead ones, and a darkroom for developing film and studying the bioluminescent animals they hoped to encounter.[134]/nThe Arcturus did not encounter the thick mats of sargassum in the Sargasso Sea that Beebe was hoping to study, but Beebe and his crew experienced great success dredging creatures from the sea off the coast of Saint Martin and Saba.[135] In the Pacific, they encountered a strange boundary between two currents of very different temperatures, containing a vast diversity of life on the border between the two. He sailed along the border between the currents for several days to document it, theorizing that it could be the cause of the unusual climate which South America had recently been experiencing. Beebe's study of these currents, and their effect on the climate of South America, is the earliest known study of the phenomenon known as El Ni\u00f1o.[136]/nAnchoring near Darwin Bay, Beebe made his first attempt at studying sea animals in their native environment by descending into the ocean in a diving helmet.[137] Beebe continued to perform helmet dives throughout his Gal\u00e1pagos expedition, documenting several previously unknown sea animals.[138] In addition to his helmet dives, Beebe applied the same method of research that he had pioneered in the tropics to a small area of ocean, sailing in circles around it for ten days to document all actions and interactions of marine life within that area. This study yielded a collection of 3,776 fish of 136 species, many of them also new to science.[139]/nWhile anchored off the Gal\u00e1pagos, Beebe and his crew noticed volcanic activity on Albemarle Island, and set out to investigate it. Anchoring in a small cove, Beebe and his assistant John Tee-Van searched for an active crater where they could observe the eruption and were nearing exhaustion by the time they found one. As he observed the crater, Beebe realized that the air surrounding it was filled with noxious gases, and narrowly avoided suffocation before staggering away from it.[140] Observing the eruption from his ship for another two days, as well as again at a later point in the expedition, Beebe recorded how numerous birds and marine animals were killed after either failing to escape the lava or drawing too close to it in an attempt to scavenge other animals that had died.[141]/nDuring the return from the Gal\u00e1pagos through the Sargasso Sea, Beebe once again failed to find the thick mats of Sargassum whose study had been one of the primary goals of the expedition. Searching for a way to satisfy his expedition's donors, Beebe hit upon the idea of documenting the marine life of the Hudson Gorge just beyond the shore of New York City. Applying the same techniques to studying the Hudson Gorge that he had used in the Gal\u00e1pagos, Beebe encountered a surprising variety of sea animals, many of which had previously been thought to be exclusive to the tropics.[142]/nShortly after Beebe's return from this expedition, Anthony Kuser requested that Beebe produce a condensed, popular version of his pheasant monograph.[143] The book which resulted from this, titled Pheasants: Their Lives and Homes (also known by the title Pheasants of the World), was released in 1926 and received the John Burroughs Medal.[144][145] During the course of writing this book, Beebe was reminded of many experiences during the pheasant expedition which he had not included in his original monograph, and wrote an additional book titled Pheasant Jungles about his adventures during this expedition.[143] While A Monograph of the Pheasants had been a factual account of this expedition, Pheasant Jungles was a somewhat fictionalized account, in which Beebe altered some aspects of his experience to appeal to a wider audience.[146]/nIn 1927, Beebe went on an expedition to Haiti to document its marine life. Anchoring his ship the Lieutenant in the harbor of Port-au-Prince, he performed over 300 helmet dives examining the area's coral reefs and classifying the fish that inhabited them.[147] These dives involved several technological innovations: a watertight brass box which could be used to house a camera for underwater photography, and a telephone which was incorporated into the diving helmet, allowing the diver to dictate observations to someone on the surface instead of having to take notes underwater.[148] Within a hundred days, Beebe and his team had created a catalog of species inhabiting the area nearly as long as what had been assembled on the neighboring island of Puerto Rico in the past four hundred years. In 1928 Beebe and Tee-Van published an illustrated and annotated list of 270 such species, which was expanded in 1935 bringing the total to 324.[149] Beebe provided an account of this expedition in his 1928 book Beneath Tropic Seas, which was the first of his books to receive less than enthusiastic reviews, due to its episodic structure.[150]/nAs he gained experience with helmet diving, Beebe soon became an enthusiastic advocate of it, believing it to be something that should be experienced by everyone who had the opportunity to do so.[151] He later went so far as to suggest that beachfront homes would someday contain their own underwater gardens, to be experienced with the help of diving helmets:/nIf you wish to make a garden, choose some beautiful slope or reef grotto and with a hatchet chop and pry off coral boulders with waving purple sea-plumes and golden sea-fans and great particolored anemones. Wedge these into crevices, and in a few days, you will have a sunken garden in a new and miraculous sense. As birds collect about the luxuriant growths of a garden in the upper air, so hosts of fish will follow your labors, great crabs and starfish will creep thither, and now and then fairy jellyfish will throb past, superior in beauty to anything in the upper world, more delicate and graceful than any butterfly.[152]/nBy this point in his life Beebe was developing a close friendship with Helen Ricker, an American romance novelist who went by the pen name of Elswyth Thane, who had met Beebe in 1925. Very little of their early correspondence survives, but Elswyth had idolized Beebe for years, and her first novel Riders of the Wind was devoted to him. The novel was an account of a young woman who falls in love with and eventually marries, a much older adventurer who strongly resembled Beebe.[153][154] Beebe and Elswyth were married on September 22, 1927, when Beebe was 50. Due to Elswyth's tendency to misrepresent her age, conflicting accounts exist of how old she was when she and Beebe were married,[155] ranging from 23[91] to 28.[155] Elswyth and Beebe had an open marriage, in which neither expected sexual exclusivity from the other so long as their life together was not damaged.[156]/nAlthough Riders of the Wind was partially based on Beebe's pheasant expedition,[157] Elswyth did not enjoy Beebe's current research.[150] She disliked the heat of the tropics and was unwilling to go with Beebe to Kartabo. As a compromise, Beebe decided to continue his marine research in Bermuda, where she and Beebe had spent their honeymoon.[158] Bermuda's governor Louis Bols introduced Beebe to Prince George, who was fascinated by Beebe's books, and Prince George persuaded Beebe to take him helmet diving. Governor Bols and Prince George subsequently offered Beebe Nonsuch Island, a 25-acre (0.10\u00a0km2) island off the east coast of Bermuda, for use as a research station.[159]/nWith the financial help of his sponsors, Beebe planned to use his new research station on Nonsuch Island to conduct a thorough study of an 8-mile (13\u00a0km) square area of ocean, documenting every living thing they could find from the surface to a depth of 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km).[160] However, Beebe's ability to research the deep ocean using these methods was constrained by the inherent limitations of dredging, which could only provide an incomplete picture of the animals living there. Beebe compared the knowledge that could be gained of the deep ocean from dredging to what a visitor from Mars could learn about a fog-shrouded earthly city by using a dredge to pick up bits of debris from a street.[161] Beebe began planning to create an underwater exploration device, which he could use to descend into the depths and observe these environments directly.[162] The New York Times carried articles describing Beebe's plans, which called for a diving bell with the shape of a cylinder.[163][164]/nThese articles caught the attention of Otis Barton, an engineer who had long admired Beebe and who had his own ambition to become a deep-sea explorer. Barton was convinced that Beebe's design for a diving vessel would never be capable of withstanding the extreme pressure of the deep ocean,[165] and with the help of a friend who arranged a meeting with Beebe, proposed an alternative design to him. Barton's design called for a spherical vessel, which was the strongest possible shape for resisting high pressure.[166] Barton had the good fortune that years earlier, Theodore Roosevelt had proposed a similar idea to Beebe, and Beebe approved of Barton's design. Beebe and Barton made a deal: Barton would pay for the sphere and all of the other equipment to go with it. In return, Beebe would pay for other expenses such as chartering a ship to raise and lower the sphere, and as the owner of the sphere, Barton would accompany Beebe on his expeditions in it.[167] Beebe named their vessel the Bathysphere, from the Greek prefix bathy- meaning \"deep\" combined with \"sphere\".[168]/nFrom 1930 to 1934, Beebe and Barton used the Bathysphere to conduct a series of dives of increasing depth off the coast of Nonsuch Island, becoming the first people to observe deep-sea animals in their native environment.[169] The Bathysphere was lowered into the ocean using a steel cable, and a second cable carried a phone line which the Bathysphere's occupants used to communicate with the surface, as well as an electrical cable for a searchlight to illuminate animals outside the Bathysphere.[170] Beebe's observations were relayed up the phone line to be recorded by Gloria Hollister,[171] his chief technical associate who was also in charge of preparing specimens obtained from dredging.[172] Beebe and Barton made a total of 35 dives in the Bathysphere,[173] setting several consecutive world records for the deepest dive ever performed by a human.[169] The record set by the deepest of these, to a depth of 3,028 feet (923\u00a0m) on August 15, 1934, lasted until it was broken by Barton in 1949.[174]/nIn 1931, Beebe and Barton's Bathysphere dives were interrupted for a year due to technical problems and uncooperative weather. An additional difficulty in 1931 was the death of Beebe's father, and Beebe left Nonsuch Island for a week to attend his father's funeral.[175] A second year-long interruption occurred in 1933, and was caused in part by a lack of funds due to the Great Depression.[176] Although Beebe and Barton performed no dives in 1933, their work gathered a large amount of publicity when the Bathysphere was displayed in a special exhibit for the American Museum of Natural History, and later at the Century of Progress World's Fair in Chicago, where they shared the fair's Hall of Science with Auguste Piccard.[177] Beebe and Barton also obtained publicity for their dives from several articles Beebe wrote describing them for National Geographic, and from an NBC radio broadcast in which Beebe's voice transmitted up the phone line from inside the Bathysphere was broadcast nationally over the radio.[178]/nAlthough Beebe attempted to ensure that Barton would receive credit as the Bathysphere's inventor and Beebe's fellow diver, the popular media tended to ignore Barton and pay attention only to Beebe.[179] Barton was often resentful of this, believing Beebe to be deliberately hogging the fame.[180] Beebe in turn lacked patience for Barton's unpredictable moods and felt that Barton did not display the proper respect for the natural world.[181] Still, Beebe and Barton both had something the other needed: Beebe for his experience as a marine biologist and Barton for his mechanical skill.[182] Out of pragmatic concern for the success of their lives, they managed to resolve their disagreements well enough to work together at Nonsuch Island,[183] although they did not remain on good terms afterward.[184]/nLikely, Beebe became romantically involved with Hollister during his work at Nonsuch Island. An entry in Beebe's personal journal, written in a secret code that he used when describing things he wished kept secret, reads \"I kissed her [Gloria] and she loves me.\"[185][186] It is unclear whether Elswyth knew of Beebe's affair with Gloria, but if she did she appears to not have minded it. In addition to the open nature of their marriage, Elswyth described in a 1940s interview with Today's Woman magazine that she enjoyed the knowledge that Beebe was attractive to women.[187]/nBeebe continued to conduct marine research after 1934, but he felt that he had seen what he wanted to see using the Bathysphere and that further drives were too expensive for whatever knowledge he gained from them to be worth the cost.[188] With the help of Beebe's friend the physician Henry Lloyd, Beebe conducted an expedition in the West Indies examining the stomach contents of tuna, which uncovered previously unknown larval forms of several species of fish.[189] Shortly after returning, Beebe set out on a longer expedition to the waters around Baja California, financed by the Californian businessman Templeton Crocker on board his yacht the Zaca. The goal of this expedition was to study the area's undersea fauna utilizing dredging and helmet diving, and Beebe and his team were surprised by the diversity of animals that they encountered there.[190] In 1937 Beebe went on a second expedition aboard the Zaca, documenting the native wildlife along the Pacific Coast from Mexico to Colombia. During this expedition, rather than focusing on either sea animals as he had at Nonsuch Island or on birds as he had earlier in his life, he attempted to document all aspects of the ecosystem.[191] Beebe described his two expeditions onboard the Zaca in his books Zaca Venture and The Book of Bays, in which he emphasized his concern for threatened habitats and his dismay at human destruction.[192]/nDuring the two Zaca expeditions Beebe was accompanied by his longtime assistant John Tee-Van as well as Jocelyn Crane, a young carcinologist who had first worked for Beebe at Nonsuch Island in 1932,[193] and who would subsequently be among Beebe's most cherished associates for the rest of his life.[194] Like Hollister before her, Crane would eventually become Beebe's lover during the long expeditions that Beebe made without Elswyth's companionship.[195] During this time Beebe was also forming a close friendship with Winnie-the-Pooh's creator A. A. Milne, who wrote of Half Mile Down \"I don't know which I envy you most: all those moral and physical qualities which you have and I lack, or all that wonder of a new world. [...] One of the few things in the world of which I am really proud is that I know Will Beebe.\"[196]/nAlthough Beebe continued to use Nonsuch Island as his base of operations throughout the 1930s, with the onset of World War II in 1939 it was announced that the ferry linking Bermuda to New York would soon be making its final run, requiring Beebe and his team to hastily abandon their station there.[197] Transportation to and from Bermuda resumed in 1940, and Beebe returned there in May 1941, but the environment was slowly being transformed due to the war. A large number of military ships made docking difficult, most of the island's reefs were being destroyed to construct an airfield, and the combination of construction activity and pollution observed the sea life impossible. Appalled by the destruction, Beebe finally rented his station at Nonsuch Island to a military contractor and returned to New York.[198]/nWith the loss of their station in Bermuda, Beebe and Elswyth gave up on their compromise of finding a research station where they could both be happy. Elswyth, who was most content in temperate environments, began searching for a home in New England where she could continue her writing. Meanwhile, Beebe began searching for a new tropical research station to replace Kartabo, which had fallen victim to deforestation just like Kalacoon before it.[199] Beebe eventually helped Elswyth purchase a small farm near Wilmington, Vermont, where he visited her frequently. Elswyth explained in a magazine interview that she was uncomfortable on Beebe's expeditions, so the two of them had agreed that they would keep their careers separate from their private lives.[200]/nWith the financial assistance of Standard Oil and the Guggenheim Foundation, Beebe established his next research station in Caripito, a small city in Venezuela around 100 miles (160\u00a0km) west of Trinidad and Tobago.[201] Beebe and his team used this station to study the ecology of the region and recorded how its inhabitants were affected by its cycle of wet and dry seasons.[202] One important study which resulted from this region was the first documentation of rhinoceros beetles using their horns in competition between males, proving that their horns were an adaptation for sexual selection rather than for defense against predators.[203] Although Beebe's research at Caripito was productive, he felt that the extremity of its wet-dry cycle made it impractical as a research station,[204] and the expanding oil operations in the region were in danger of destroying the local environment.[202] For these reasons, Beebe did not return to Caripito after his first season there.[204]/nIn the spring of 1944, Jocelyn Crane returned to Venezuela to search for a location for a new field station to replace the one at Caripito. The location that she found, known as Rancho Grande, had initially been intended as a palace for Venezuela's dictator Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez in the  Henri Pittier National Park. The palace's construction had been left unfinished after G\u00f3mez's death, and since then the building's vast corridors and ballrooms had become the home of jaguars, tapirs and sloths.[205] Unlike Beebe's other tropical research stations, which had been located in lowland regions, Rancho Grande was located on a mountainside in what Beebe described as \"the ultimate cloud jungle\".[206] Creole Petroleum, a Venezuelan spin-off of Standard, agreed to cover the cost of the station and finished a small portion of the vast structure for Beebe and his team to use. Beebe and his team began work there in 1945, staying as guests of the Venezuelan government.[205]/nRancho Grande was located at a mountain pass in a branch of the Andes known as the Venezuelan Coastal Range, which was an important migration route for butterflies, and the station proved very lucrative in the study of insects.[207] During his work at Rancho Grande, Beebe broke his leg in a fall from a ladder, and the forced immobility which resulted from having his leg in a cast presented him with a new opportunity for observing the area's wildlife. At his request, he and his chair were transported into the nearby jungle, and as he sat motionless the wild animals around him soon began to go about their business without noticing his presence.[208] His immobility also presented him with the opportunity to spend hours at a time observing a pair of bat falcons through binoculars, documenting the behavior of their two chicks and every prey item fed to them by their parents. His observations documented several behaviors which were new to science, including the first documented example of play in birds.[209]/nAlthough Beebe and his team enjoyed rewarding seasons at Rancho Grande in 1945 and 1946, they did not return there in 1947. The reason they gave in their annual report was that the previous two seasons had produced so much material that they needed an additional year to analyze it, but in reality, this was more the result of insufficient funding as well as the unstable state of Venezuelan politics. Beebe returned to Rancho Grande in 1948, where he completed several technical papers about the migration patterns of birds and insects, as well as a comprehensive study of the area's ecology which he coauthored with Jocelyn Crane. Realizing that the area's politics might soon put an end to their research there, in spring of 1948 Jocelyn made a side trip to Trinidad and Tobago in hope of finding a site for a research station where the politics would be more secure.[210] Finally, when the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat installed Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez as Venezuela's dictator, Beebe decided that he could no longer continue to work in Venezuela.[211] Beebe described his experiences at Rancho Grande in his 1949 book High Jungle, which was the last of Beebe's major books.[212]/nIn January 1950, the New York Zoological Society celebrated to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Beebe's work for them.[213] He was by this point the only remaining member of the zoo's original staff,[214] and had produced more scholarly papers and publicity than any other employee. Letters and testimonials poured in from other scientists with whom Beebe had worked, attesting to their admiration of him and his influence on them. One letter from the Harvard biologist Ernst Mayr wrote that Beebe's work had been an inspiration to his own, particularly A Monograph of the Pheasants and Beebe's books about jungle wildlife.[215]/nThe product of Jocelyn Crane's search for a potential research station in Trinidad and Tobago was a house on a hill overlooking the Arima Valley, which was known as Verdant Vale.[216] In 1949, Beebe bought this estate to use a permanent research station to replace Rancho Grande. Beebe renamed the estate Simla, after the hill in India that featured in Rudyard Kipling's writings.[194][217] He later described the sense of destiny that marked his introduction to the estate:/nWe had climbed the winding road in a tropical downpour. As we came out below the outermost wall, the sun broke through, three house wrens sang at once, and a double rainbow sprayed the valley with infrared and ultraviolet. We would not have been human if we had refused to recognize omens.[217]/nAt Simla Beebe and his team worked closely together with Asa and Newcome Wright, the owners of the adjacent Spring Hill estate, who provided accommodations for them while water and electricity were connected at Simla.[218] Although the initial purchase of Simla had contained only the house and 22 acres (0.089\u00a0km2) of the forest surrounding it, Beebe soon realized that this was insufficient for the research he wished to conduct, and purchased another neighboring estate known as St. Pat's which contained an additional 170 acres (0.69\u00a0km2).[219] In 1953, Beebe donated both properties to the New York Zoological Society for one dollar,[211] giving him the position of one of the society's \"Benefactors in Perpetuity\".[220]/nResearch at Simla formally began in 1950.[221] Beebe's research at Simla combined elements of many different earlier stages of his research, including observations of the life cycles of the area's birds, detailed analyses of every plant and animal in small areas of forest, and studies of insect behavior.[222] Insects were the focus of the scientific papers he produced during this period, marking a transition from his past areas of study into the field of entomology.[223] Local children periodically brought animal specimens to Beebe at Simla and asked him to classify them. Remembering the early studies of his own childhood, in which he had brought specimens to the American Museum of Natural History, he was happily working with them.[224]/nIn 1952, on his seventy-fifth birthday, Beebe retired from his position as the director of the NYZS's Department of Zoological Society and became Director Emeritus, while Jocelyn Crane was promoted to Assistant Director.[220][223] In honor of his lifetime of work as a naturalist, Beebe was awarded the Theodore Roosevelt Distinguished Service Medal in 1953.[1][225] Beebe's last major expedition occurred in 1955, retracing the route he had taken during his pheasant expedition 45 years earlier, with the intention of discovering how the populations he had previously studied were faring in response to human encroachment.[226][227] Jocelyn accompanied him on this expedition for the purpose of documenting Asia's fiddler crabs. Although Jocelyn's studies during this expedition served as part of the basis for her monograph Fiddler Crabs of the World,[228] Beebe never published the results of his own observations during it.[227]/nDuring Beebe's later years, Simla was an important gathering point for researchers in many other areas of biology. Other biologists who visited to conduct studies there and exchange ideas with Beebe included myrmecologist Ted Schneirla, ethologist Konrad Lorenz, entomologist Lincoln Brower, ethologist Donald Griffin, and ornithologist David Snow.[229] Snow became a regular visitor to Simla,[230] and in return Beebe provided financial assistance for some of Snow's own research.[231] Beebe devised an unusual method for determining how he would react to his visitors at Simla. His terrace there was decorated with statues of characters from Winnie-the-Pooh that had been a gift from A. A. Milne. Visitors who recognized these characters as Milne's creations were greeted by Beebe with enthusiasm, while those who did not recognize them were just endured by Beebe until they left.[210][232]/nBeebe remained active well into his old age. In 1957, at the age of eighty, he was still capable of climbing slippery tree trunks to study bird nests.[233] However, by 1959 his strength had lessened enough that long hikes and tree climbing were no longer practical for him, and he contented himself with work that could be conducted in the laboratory, such as dissecting birds' nests to analyze their method of construction.[234] Beebe also began to be afflicted with a throat ailment which may have been Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, although lacking a complete understanding of what caused it, Beebe and his doctors referred to it as \"mango mouth\". Beebe was reluctant to accept speaking engagements because of the effect this had on his voice, although he continued to give lectures on occasion with Jocelyn's help.[235]/nIn an account of his final meeting with Beebe, Henry Fairfield Osborn, Jr. describes how during Beebe's last few years he gradually succumbed to illness, eventually becoming nearly immobile and incapable of speech.[236] However, Beebe's personal physician A. E. Hill provides a differing account, stating that Beebe remained lucid and able to move about without assistance almost until his last day, apart from the periods of time during which his \"mango mouth\" temporarily slurred his speech.[237] Both accounts agree that throughout his final years Beebe remained fond of playing practical jokes on his visitors at Simla,[237] and retained his sense of humor even within days of his death.[236]/nWilliam Beebe died of pneumonia at Simla on June 4, 1962.[238][239] According to his wishes, he was buried in Mucurapo Cemetery in Port of Spain. Memorial services were held in both Trinidad and Tobago and New York City so that Beebe's friends in both parts of the world could attend. Following Beebe's death, Jocelyn succeeded him as the director of the Department of Tropical Research and continued to run the Simla station along with the rest of Beebe's former staff.[240]/nBeebe had frequently worried that Elswyth would write a biography of him after his death. To prevent this possibility, he left all of his papers and journals to Jocelyn. After Elswyth died in 1984, Jocelyn donated Beebe's papers to the Department of Rare Books and Special Collections at Princeton University's Firestone Library.[241] Even in the possession of Firestone Library, Beebe's papers remained inaccessible without Jocelyn's permission, and most scholars were prevented from using them until Jocelyn offered access to the writer, Carol Grant Gould, to write Beebe's biography.[242]  The Archives of the Wildlife Conservation Society also holds several collections related to the Department of Tropical Research./nWilliam Beebe was more famous in the United States than any other American naturalist before the days of television.[244] As a scientific writer who participated in both the popular and academic worlds, he occupied a similar role to the role later occupied by Stephen Jay Gould. Beebe was a well-known figure in the Roaring Twenties of New York City and was friends with numerous other well-known figures of the period, including Fannie Hurst and the cartoonist Rube Goldberg.[245] Although he was not physically handsome in the traditional sense, he tended to dominate every social and professional situation due to his enthusiasm, intelligence, and charisma.[246] As a result of his much-publicized divorce from Blair and his later marriage to Elswyth, he was also known for his stormy relationships with women.[245]/nBeebe described his religious beliefs as a combination of Presbyterianism and Buddhism. His religion was largely the result of seeking to combine his sense of awe and wonder at the natural world with a scientific understanding of its workings.[247] He was highly critical of efforts to use science to justify political ideologies, such as socialism[248] or the belief that women were inferior to men.[249] Beebe also disapproved of the eugenic ideas advocated by many biologists in the early 20th century, including some of his contemporaries at the zoo, although this was largely out of fear that these ideas would alienate friends of the zoo and cause divisions among its staff.[250]/nBeebe had a troubled relationship with some of his superiors at the zoo, particularly Hornaday, who was resentful of Beebe's constant demands for more funding and staff, as well as the fact that as Beebe's career progressed he gradually devoted less and less time to care for the zoo itself.[251] One particular point of disagreement was Beebe's forgetfulness about returning books which he had borrowed from the Zoological Society's Library, which would occasionally go missing for years as a result.[252] However, Hornaday never publicly expressed his disagreements with Beebe and did not hesitate to defend Beebe's work when others criticized it.[253]/nBeebe had high expectations of the people working under him on all of his expeditions,[254] although he never revealed the exact characteristics that he looked for in potential employees.[255] Henry Fairfield Osborn Jr. recounts one incident in which Beebe turned down a scientist who wished to work with him when the scientist described boredom with his current duties as one of his reasons for requesting this. In response to this request, Beebe retorted:/nBoredom is immoral. All a man has to do is see. All about us, nature puts on the most thrilling adventure stories ever created, but we have to use our eyes. I was walking across our compound last month when a queen termite began building her miraculous city. I saw it because I was looking down. One night three giant fruit bats flew over the face of the moon. I saw them because I was looking up. To some men, the jungle is a tangled place of heat and danger. But, to the man who can see, its vines and plants form a beautiful and carefully ordered tapestry. No, I don't want any bored men around me.[24]/nBeebe nonetheless exhibited a high degree of loyalty to those employees who were capable of meeting his standards. When he felt that the pressure of working under him had become too great, he would announce that his birthday was approaching, and his staff would have several days free from work to celebrate it. On one such occasion, when a scientist working under Beebe whispered to him that he knew it was not in fact Beebe's birthday, Beebe responded \"A man should have a birthday when he needs one\".[256]/nWilliam Beebe was a pioneer in the field now known as ecology. His theory that organisms must be understood in the context of the ecosystems they inhabit was completely new for its time and has been highly influential.[257][258] The method he invented of methodically analyzing all organisms within a small area of wilderness has become a standard method in this field.[259] Beebe was also a pioneer in the field of oceanography, setting a precedent with his Bathysphere dives which many other researchers would follow.[260]/nE. O. Wilson, Sylvia Earle and Ernst Mayr have all described Beebe's work as an influence on their own choice of careers.[215][249] Among the most significant of Beebe's influences on other researchers was Rachel Carson, who regarded Beebe as both a friend and an inspiration.[261] Carson dedicated her 1951 book The Sea Around Us to Beebe, writing \"My absorption in the mystery and meaning of the sea have been stimulated and the writing of this book aided by the friendship and encouragement of William Beebe.\"[258] Due to Beebe's renewed emphasis on field research at a time when laboratory studies were becoming the dominant trend in biology, more recent field researchers such as Jane Goodall and George Schaller are also sometimes considered his intellectual descendants.[262]/nBy writing for a scientific as well as the popular audience, Beebe did much to make science accessible to the general public.[114][263] This was particularly significant in the area of conservation, of which he was one of the most important early advocates.[47] With his many writings about the dangers of environmental destruction, Beebe helped to raise public awareness about this topic.[264] However, Beebe's prolific writing for a popular audience had a downside, in that other scientists of his time were reluctant to hold him in high accord because they regarded him as a popularizer.[114]/nDuring the course of his career, Beebe authored over 800 articles and 21 books, including his four-volume pheasant monograph. He had a total of 64 animals named after him, and he described one new species of bird and 87 species of fish (see Category:Taxa named by William Beebe). While 83 of the fish that he described were done so in a conventional manner, the remaining four were done so based on visual observations.[263]/nA lingering controversy exists in ichthyology over the validity of the four species Beebe described based on visual descriptions only, which he had observed during his Bathysphere dives.[265] The naming of a new species ordinarily requires obtaining and analyzing a type specimen, something which was obviously impossible from inside the Bathysphere.[266] Some of Beebe's critics claimed that these fish were illusions resulting from condensation on the Bathysphere's window, or even that Beebe willfully made them up, although the latter would have been strongly at odds with Beebe's reputation as an honest and rigorous scientist.[267] While many of Beebe's observations from the Bathysphere have since been confirmed by advances in undersea photography,[226] it is unclear whether others fit the description of any known sea animal.[268] One possibility is that although these animals indeed exist, so much remains to be discovered about life in the deep ocean that these animals have yet to be seen by anyone other than him.[269]/nIn addition to his descriptions of new taxa, the crab Leptuca beebei (Crane, 1941), commonly known as Beebe's fiddler crab, was named in his honor.[270]/nAlong with his analysis of pheasant phylogeny and his studies of life in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, Beebe regarded one of his most important contributions to the field of evolutionary biology to be his hypothesis that the ancestors of birds passed through what he referred to as a \u201cTetrapteryx stage\u201d, with wings on both their front and hind limbs. Beebe based this theory on his observation that the hatchlings and embryos of some modern birds possess long quill feathers on their legs, which he regarded as an atavism; he also noticed vestiges of leg-wings on one of the specimens of Archaeopteryx. Beebe described his idea in a 1915 paper published in Zoologica, titled \"A Tetrapteryx Stage in the Ancestry of Birds\".[271]/nGerhard Heilmann discussed Beebe's Tetrapteryx hypothesis at considerable length in his 1926 book The Origin of Birds. Heilmann examined hatchlings of many other bird species, both closely related to those studied by Beebe and belonging to more primitive species, in hope of finding additional evidence for the leg-wings which Beebe had documented. After failing to find such evidence, Heilmann ultimately rejected Beebe's Tetrapteryx hypothesis, and this remained the consensus among ornithologists for the next several decades.[272] Beebe, however, continued to advance his Tetrapteryx hypothesis as late as the 1940s.[273]/nIn 2003, Beebe's Tetrapteryx hypothesis was supported by the discovery of Microraptor gui, a small feathered dinosaur which possessed asymmetrical flight feathers on both its front and hind limbs. Beebe's Tetrapteryx hypothesis is now regarded as prescient for its prediction of both the anatomy and likely gliding posture of Microraptor gui,[274] which Richard O. Prum has described as \"[looking] as if it could have glided straight out of the pages of Beebe\u2019s notebooks.\"[275] This animal's discovery has had the effect of resurrecting Beebe's theory that leg feathers played an important role in the origin of bird flight.[276]/nFollowing William Beebe's death in 1962, his research station at Simla remained in operation under Jocelyn Crane's management,[277] under the new name of the William Beebe Tropical Research Station.[278] However, because Jocelyn's research required her to travel north for extended periods, by 1965 she had little time to keep the station running.[279] By 1971, the station had fallen into disuse and was declared closed.[280] Meanwhile, as Asa Wright's health began to fail in her old age, her friends began to fear that after her death her neighboring estate of Spring Hill might be lost to developers and established a trust to buy the estate and convert it into the Asa Wright nature center.[281] In 1974, Beebe's property was donated to the newly established Asa Wright Nature Center.[282]/nNow under the management of the Asa Wright Nature Center, the William Beebe Tropical Research Station has gradually been renovated. It is now once again actively involved in research and an important gathering place for scientists.[283] It is also a popular destination for birdwatchers, who can observe the same populations of hummingbirds, tanagers and oilbirds that William Beebe studied decades earlier.[279]", "69379040": "Elizabeth L.

The lab has been referred to as the \"Ghost Lab\" for Matzinger's choice to conduct the first nine months of her research alone with a focus on chaos theory. In 2013, while reorganizing the Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, NIAID transferred Matzinger's section to the Laboratory of Immunogenetics.[6]/nIn 2015, Matzinger recorded an eight-part series on the danger model of the immune system, covering transplant rejection, tumors, autoimmunity, T cells, parasites, and alarmins.[7]/nThe Self/Non-self Model proposed by Macfarlane Burnet and Frank Fenner in 1949 faced challenges in the late 1980s as immunologists recognized that T cells depend on antigen-presenting cells showcasing materials and sending co-stimulatory signals. Driven by the writings of Thomas Kuhn on paradigm shifts in science, Charles Janeway made a 1989 proposal that the innate immune system was the real gatekeeper of immune system responses. He also theorized that the innate immune system used ancient pattern-recognition receptors to make these decisions, recognizing a pathogen by its unchanging characteristics./nIn her 1994 article \"Tolerance, Danger, and the Extended Family\", Matzinger extended the danger model, arguing that antigen-presenting cells respond to \"danger signals\" released from cells undergoing unprogrammed cell death when injured or stressed, as opposed to apoptosis (controlled cell death). The alarm signals released by these cells let the immune system know that there is a problem requiring an immune response. She argued that T cells and the immune response they orchestrate occurs not because of a neonatal definition of \"self\", as in the previous model, nor because of ancient definitions of pathogens, as in Janeway's argument, but because of a dynamic and constantly updated response to danger as defined by cellular damage.[8]/nThe danger model is broad, covering topics as diverse as transplantation, maternal/fetal immunity, autoimmunity, cancer treatments, and vaccines. Matzinger argues that prior models failed to explain why immune system responses vary based on the specific threat's location and severity. Prior models also fail to explain how the immune system rejects tumors, induces autoimmune diseases, or generates allergic responses./nSome immunologists still maintain Janeway's ideas, believing that the immune response is mainly fueled by innate evolutionarily conserved \"pattern recognition receptors\" that recognize similarities between microorganisms, minimizing the effects of unprogrammed cell death./nSeung-Yong Seong and Matzinger have proposed exposed hydrophobic regions on biological compounds as among the damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) of the danger model. Facing stressors, cells misfold and denature their proteins, exposing hydrophobic regions that aggregate into clumps to avoid exposure to the water-filled environment.[9]/nIn a 2013 article in Nature Immunology, Matzinger highlighted the danger model's primary implication that bodily tissues drive immune responses. As research continues to show the bacteria of each organ's microbiome guiding its function and outputs, Matzinger theorizes that microbes may be shown as driving immune system responses.[10] Matzinger argues that DAMPs may explain why toll-like receptors respond to both external and endogenous ligand signals with her danger model suggesting a multitude of signalling pathways determining the extent and nature of each immune system response./nRegulatory T cells have been shown suppressing immune responses, exemplified by the autoimmune IPEX syndrome occurring when the master regulator of these Treg cells is dysfunctional.[11] Matzinger has incorporated Treg cells into her danger model, arguing that their regulation activity is not absolute, based on transplant organs being rejected at higher rates if infected, showing that danger signals continue to dictate the immune response.[12]/nCriticisms of the danger model focus on two key points: First, Matzinger argued that tumors persist to cause cancer because their cells undergo programmed cell death, failing to release danger signals for an immune response. However, recent research has shown the immune system detecting and destroying some tumors. Second, the danger model explains transplant rejection as the result of surgery-induced damage, but this explanation fails to account for greater tolerance of autotransplantation, the movement of tissue between parts of the same body.[13]/nTerms coined by Matzinger, such as \"professional antigen-presenting-cell\", \"danger signal\", and \"DAMPs\", are frequently repurposed for explanations of the self/non-self model of the immune system. The immunologist Russell E. Vance has argued that immunological paradigms like the danger model are inevitably inaccurate representations of distinct mechanisms generated under evolutionary pressure.[14]/nIn 1978, Matzinger published her fourth paper in the Journal of Experimental Medicine, listing her Afghan Hound, Galadriel Mirkwood, as a coauthor to write in a third-person active voice.[15] Upon identifying the misconduct, she was banned from publishing in the journal.[16]/nAt the 1986 K\u00f6ln Film Festival, Polly Matzinger won the Award for Special Excellence in Educational Films for the German translation of Immunity: The Inside Story.

She began her career as a science teacher.[5] In 1955 she married Victor Hazan, an Italian-born, New York-raised Sephardic Jew who subsequently gained fame as a wine writer, and the couple moved to New York City a few months later.[6]/nHazan had never cooked before her marriage. As she recounted in the introduction to her 1997 book Marcella Cucina:/n\"... there I was, having to feed a young, hard-working husband who could deal cheerfully with most of life's ups and downs, but not with an indifferent meal. In Italy, I would not have wasted time thinking about it. My mother cooked, my father cooked, both my grandmothers cooked, even the farm girls who came in to clean could cook. In the kitchen of my New York apartment there was no one.\"/nShe began by using cookbooks from Italy, but then realized that her clear memory of the flavors she had tasted at home allowed her to reproduce them herself. \"Eventually I learned that some of the methods I adopted were idiosyncratically my own,\" she recalled, \"but for most of them I found corroboration in the practices of traditional Italian cooks.\"/nHazan began giving cooking lessons in her apartment and opened her own cooking school, the School of Classic Italian Cooking, in 1969.[1] In the early 1970s, Craig Claiborne, who was then the food editor of the New York Times, asked her to contribute recipes to the paper[citation needed]. She published her first book, The Classic Italian Cook Book, in 1973. In 1980, having been published in a version adapted for a British readership by Anna Del Conte, it won an Andr\u00e9 Simon Award. A sequel, More Classic Italian Cooking, followed in 1978; the two were collected in one volume, Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking, in 1992. Her 1997 book Marcella Cucina won the James Beard Foundation book award for Best Mediterranean Cookbook and the Julia Child Award for Best International Cookbook  the following year.[7] She wrote in Italian, and her books were translated by her husband.[1]/nHazan's cookbooks concentrate on strictly traditional Italian cookery, without American or British influence[citation needed]. To that end, her recipes call for ingredients typical of the Italian home (with some concessions for ones not readily available outside Italy). They are also designed to fit into an Italian menu of two balanced 'principal courses' followed by a salad and dessert. Although Hazan prefers the painstaking approach of both preparing food by hand rather than machine and cooking it on burners atop the stove rather than in the oven, her recipes can yet be simple, one of the most popular of them (by her own report) consisting simply of a chicken roasted with two lemons in its cavity.[8] Her celebrated recipe for Italian tomato sauce is frequently cited by the cooking section of the New York Times./nAmong the techniques Hazan suggests are:[importance?]/nHazan frequently[vague] prefaces her recipes with descriptions of how the food is eaten in Italy, or with her own memories of it. For example, her recipe for coffee ice with whipped cream, included in Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking, begins:/n\"Granita di caff\u00e8 con panna was the most welcome sign that Italian caf\u00e9s used to put out in summer. On an afternoon slowed down by the southern sun, it was one of the best ways to while away the time, watching life dawdle by as you let the granita's crystals melt on the tongue, spoonful by spoonful, until the roof of your mouth felt like an ice cavern pervaded by the aroma of strong coffee. Unfortunately and inexplicably, granita has largely disappeared. You can easily make it at home, however, and with the food processor it is even easier to do than it used to be.\"/nHazan has been credited[9][by whom?] with starting a craze for balsamic vinegar, something she later regretted because she thought people were overusing it.[10][11]/nCraig Claiborne said of Hazan's work, \"No one has ever done more to spread the gospel of pure Italian cookery in America\".[3] The food critic Jeffrey Steingarten, who once travelled[importance?] to the Hazans' second home in Venice for a cooking lesson, predicted that Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking \"will become the essential Italian cookbook for an entire generation\"[This quote needs a citation]. In a review of Marcella's Italian Kitchen for salon.com, Craig Seligman criticized Hazan's \"impatient and judgmental tone\", but added: \"... her recipes are so beautiful and so reliable and, most of the time, so brilliantly simple that what can you do but venerate her and love her in spite of herself?\" [12]/nIn 1998, Hazan retired from her cooking school, and she and Victor moved to Longboat Key, Florida. There Hazan found that she could no longer get some of the Italian ingredients she had taken for granted in New York, and she decided to write a cookbook for people in the same situation. The result was Marcella Says ..., published in 2004./nHazan taught courses at the French Culinary Institute. In 2003, she was made a Knight of the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity.[13]/nMarcella Hazan died on September 29, 2013, in Longboat Key, Florida.[1]/nHer son, Giuliano, is also a noted cookery writer and teacher.", "42001": "Antonie Philips van Leeuwenhoek[note 2] FRS (/\u02c8\u0251\u02d0nt\u0259ni v\u0251\u02d0n \u02c8le\u026av\u0259nhu\u02d0k, -h\u028ak/ AHN-t\u0259-nee vahn LAY-v\u0259n-hook, -\u2060huuk; Dutch: [\u02c8\u0251nto\u02d0ni v\u0251n \u02c8le\u02d0u.\u0259(n)\u02cc\u0266uk] \u24d8; 24 October 1632 \u2013 26 August 1723) was a Dutch microbiologist and microscopist in the Golden Age of Dutch science and technology. A largely self-taught man in science, he is commonly known as \"the Father of Microbiology\", and one of the first microscopists and microbiologists.[5][6][7][8] Van Leeuwenhoek is best known for his pioneering work in microscopy and for his contributions toward the establishment of microbiology as a scientific discipline./nRaised in Delft, Dutch Republic, Van Leeuwenhoek worked as a draper in his youth and founded his own shop in 1654. He became well-recognized in municipal politics and developed an interest in lensmaking. In the 1670s, he started to explore microbial life with his microscope./nUsing single-lensed microscopes of his own design and make, Van Leeuwenhoek was the first to observe and to experiment with microbes, which he originally referred to as dierkens, diertgens or diertjes.[note 3] He was the first to relatively determine their size. Most of the \"animalcules\" are now referred to as unicellular organisms, although he observed multicellular organisms in pond water. He was also the first to document microscopic observations of muscle fibers, bacteria, spermatozoa, red blood cells, crystals in gouty tophi, and among the first to see blood flow in capillaries. Although Van Leeuwenhoek did not write any books, he described his discoveries in chaotic letters to the Royal Society, which published many of his letters in their Philosophical Transactions.[10]/nAntonie van Leeuwenhoek was born in Delft, Dutch Republic, on 24 October 1632. On 4 November, he was baptized as Thonis. His father, Philips Antonisz van Leeuwenhoek, was a basket maker who died when Antonie was only five years old. His mother, Margaretha (Bel van den Berch), came from a well-to-do brewer's family. She remarried Jacob Jansz Molijn, a painter and the family moved to Warmond around 1640. Antonie had four older sisters: Margriet, Geertruyt, Neeltje, and Catharina.[11] When he was around ten years old his step-father died. He was sent to live in Benthuizen with his uncle, an attorney.  At the age of 16 he became a bookkeeper's apprentice (casher) at a linen-draper's shop at Warmoesstraat in Amsterdam,[12] which was owned by William Davidson. Van Leeuwenhoek left there after six years.[13][14]/nIn July 1654 Van Leeuwenhoek married Barbara de Mey in Delft, with whom he fathered one surviving daughter, Maria (four other children died in infancy). He would live and study for the rest of his life at Hypolytusbuurt in a house he bought in 1655. He opened a draper's shop, selling linen, yarn and ribbon to seamstresses and tailors.[15]  His status in Delft grew throughout the years. In 1660 he received a lucrative job as chamberlain for the sheriffs in the city hall, a position which he would hold for almost 40 years. His duties included maintaining the premises, heating, cleaning, opening for meetings, performing duties for those assembled, and maintaining silence on all matters discussed there./nIn 1669 he was appointed as a land surveyor by the court of Holland; at some time he combined it with another municipal job, being the official \"wine-gauger\" of Delft and in charge of the city wine imports and taxation.[16] His wife had died in 1666, and in 1671, Van Leeuwenhoek remarried to Cornelia Swalmius with whom he had no children.[17]/nVan Leeuwenhoek was a contemporary of another famous Delft citizen, the painter Johannes Vermeer, who was baptized just four days earlier. It has been suggested that he is the man portrayed in two Vermeer paintings of the late 1660s, The Astronomer and The Geographer, but others argue that there appears to be little physical similarity. Because they were both relatively important men in a city with only 24,000 inhabitants, living both close to the main market, it is likely they knew each other. Van Leeuwenhoek acted as the executor of Vermeer's will when the painter died in 1675.[18][note 4]/nVan Leeuwenhoek's religion was \"Dutch Reformed\" and Calvinist.[19] Like Jan Swammerdam he often referred with reverence to the wonders God designed in making creatures great and small, and believed that his discoveries were merely further proof of the wonder of creation.[20][21]/nWhile running his draper shop, Van Leeuwenhoek wanted to see the quality of the thread better than what was possible using the magnifying lenses of the time. He developed an interest in lensmaking, although few records exist of his early activity. By placing the middle of a small rod of soda lime glass in a hot flame, one can pull the hot section apart to create two long whiskers of glass. Then, by reinserting the end of one whisker into the flame, a very small, high-quality glass lens is created. Significantly, a May 2021 neutron tomography study of a high-magnification Leeuwenhoek microscope[22] captured images of the short glass stem characteristic of this lens creation method. For lower magnifications he also made ground lenses.[23] To help keep his methods confidential he apparently intentionally encouraged others to think grinding was his primary or only lens construction method./nAfter developing his method for creating powerful lenses and applying them to the study of the microscopic world,[24] Van Leeuwenhoek introduced his work to his friend, the prominent Dutch physician Reinier de Graaf. When the Royal Society in London published the groundbreaking work of an Italian lensmaker in their journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, de Graaf wrote to the editor of the journal, Henry Oldenburg, with a ringing endorsement of Van Leeuwenhoek's microscopes which, he claimed, \"far surpass those which we have hitherto seen\". In response, in 1673 the society published a letter from Van Leeuwenhoek that included his microscopic observations on mold, bees, and lice.[25]/nVan Leeuwenhoek's work fully captured the attention of the Royal Society, and he began corresponding regularly with the society regarding his observations. At first he had been reluctant to publicize his findings, regarding himself as a businessman with little scientific, artistic, or writing background, but de Graaf urged him to be more confident in his work.[26] By the time Van Leeuwenhoek died in 1723, he had written some 190 letters to the Royal Society, detailing his findings in a wide variety of fields, centered on his work in microscopy. He only wrote letters in his own colloquial Dutch; he never published a proper scientific paper in Latin. He strongly preferred to work alone, distrusting the sincerity of those who offered their assistance.[27] The letters were translated into Latin or English by Henry Oldenburg, who had learned Dutch for this very purpose.[citation needed] He was also the first to use the word animalcules to translate the Dutch words that Leeuwenhoek used to describe microorganisms.[9] Despite the initial success of Van Leeuwenhoek's relationship with the Royal Society, soon relations became severely strained. His credibility was questioned when he sent the Royal Society a copy of his first observations of microscopic single-celled organisms dated 9 October 1676.[28] Previously, the existence of single-celled organisms was entirely unknown. Thus, even with his established reputation with the Royal Society as a reliable observer, his observations of microscopic life were initially met with some skepticism.[29]/nEventually, in the face of Van Leeuwenhoek's insistence, the Royal Society arranged for Alexander Petrie, minister to the English Reformed Church in Delft; Benedict Haan, at that time Lutheran minister at Delft; and Henrik Cordes, then Lutheran minister at the Hague, accompanied by Sir Robert Gordon and four others, to determine whether it was in fact Van Leeuwenhoek's ability to observe and reason clearly, or perhaps, the Royal Society's theories of life that might require reform. Finally in 1677,[30] Van Leeuwenhoek's observations were fully acknowledged by the Royal Society.[31]/nAntonie van Leeuwenhoek was elected to the Royal Society in February 1680 on the nomination of William Croone, a then-prominent physician.[note 5] Van Leeuwenhoek was \"taken aback\" by the nomination, which he considered a high honour, although he did not attend the induction ceremony in London, nor did he ever attend a Royal Society meeting.[33] He had his portrait painted by Jan Verkolje with the certificate signed by James II of England on the table beside him./nBy the end of the seventeenth century, Van Leeuwenhoek had a virtual monopoly on microscopic study and discovery. His contemporary Robert Hooke, an early microscope pioneer, bemoaned that the field had come to rest entirely on one man's shoulders.[34] In 1673, his first letter was published in the journal of the Royal Society of London. He was visited over the years by many notable individuals who gazed at the tiny creatures. One of the first was Jan Swammerdam.[35] Around 1675 it was Johan Huydecoper. The latter being very interested in collecting and growing plants for his estate Goudestein and in 1682 manager of the Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam. Christiaan Huygens, Leibniz (1676), John Locke (1678, 1685),  James II of England (1679), William III of Orange, Mary II of England and Thomas Molyneux (in 1685). In October 1697, Van Leeuwenhoek visited the Tsar Peter the Great on his boat, moored in the Schie or the Arsenaal.[36] On this occasion he presented the Tsar with an \"eel-viewer\", so Peter could study blood circulation whenever he wanted.[37] In 1706 it was Govert Bidloo; in 1714 Richard Bradley (botanist), in 1716 Herman Boerhaave and Frederik Ruysch.[35] To the disappointment of his guests, Van Leeuwenhoek refused to reveal the cutting-edge microscopes he relied on for his discoveries, instead showing visitors a collection of average-quality lenses.[38]/nAntonie van Leeuwenhoek made more than 500 optical lenses. He also created at least 25 single-lens microscopes, of differing types, of which only nine have survived. These microscopes were made of silver or copper frames, holding hand-made lenses. Those that have survived are capable of magnification up to 275 times. It is suspected that Van Leeuwenhoek possessed some microscopes that could magnify up to 500 times. Although he has been widely regarded as a dilettante or amateur, his scientific research was of remarkably high quality.[39]/nThe single-lens microscopes of Van Leeuwenhoek were relatively small devices, the largest being about 5\u00a0cm long.[40][41] They are used by placing the lens very close in front of the eye. The other side of the microscope had a pin, where the sample was attached in order to stay close to the lens. There were also three screws to move the pin and the sample along three axes: one axis to change the focus, and the two other axes to navigate through the sample./nVan Leeuwenhoek maintained throughout his life that there are aspects of microscope construction \"which I only keep for myself\", in particular his most critical secret of how he made the lenses.[42] For many years no one was able to reconstruct Van Leeuwenhoek's design techniques, but in 1957, C. L. Stong used thin glass thread fusing instead of polishing, and successfully created some working samples of a Van Leeuwenhoek design microscope.[43] Such a method was also discovered independently by A. Mosolov and A. Belkin at the Russian Novosibirsk State Medical Institute.[44] In May 2021 researchers in the Netherlands published a non-destructive neutron tomography study of a Leeuwenhoek microscope.[22] One image in particular shows a Stong/Mosolov-type spherical lens with a single short glass stem attached (Fig. 4). Such lenses are created by pulling an extremely thin glass filament, breaking the filament, and briefly fusing the filament end. The nuclear tomography article notes this lens creation method was first devised by Robert Hooke rather than Leeuwenhoek, which is ironic given Hooke's subsequent surprise at Leeuwenhoek's findings./nVan Leeuwenhoek used samples and measurements to estimate numbers of microorganisms in units of water.[45][46] He also made good use of the huge advantage provided by his method. He studied a broad range of microscopic phenomena, and shared the resulting observations freely with groups such as the British Royal Society.[47] Such work firmly established his place in history as one of the first and most important explorers of the microscopic world. Van Leeuwenhoek was one of the first people to observe cells, much like Robert Hooke.[48] Van Leeuwenhoek wrote his letters in Dutch and sent them to the Royal Society; the letters were then translated into English. He corresponded with Antonio Magliabechi.[49]/nVan Leeuwenhoek has been recognized as the first person to use a histological stain to color specimens observed under the microscope using saffron.[61] He used this technique only once.[62][63]/nLike Robert Boyle and Nicolaas Hartsoeker, Van Leeuwenhoek was interested in dried cochineal, trying to find out if the dye came from a berry or an insect.[64][65][66][67]/nHe studied rainwater, the seeds of oranges, worms in sheep's liver, the eye of a whale, the blood of fishes, mites, coccinellidae, the skin of elephants, Celandine, and Cinchona.[49]/n/nBy the end of his life, Van Leeuwenhoek had written approximately 560 letters to the Royal Society and other scientific institutions concerning his observations and discoveries. Even during the last weeks of his life, Van Leeuwenhoek continued to send letters full of observations to London. The last few contained a precise description of his own illness. He suffered from a rare disease, an uncontrolled movement of the midriff, which now is named van Leeuwenhoek's disease.[68] He died at the age of 90, on 26 August 1723, and was buried four days later in the Oude Kerk in Delft.[69]/nIn 1981, the British microscopist Brian J. Ford found that Van Leeuwenhoek's original specimens had survived in the collections of the Royal Society of London. They were found to be of high quality, and all were well preserved.[70][71][72] Ford carried out observations with a range of single-lens microscopes, adding to our knowledge of Van Leeuwenhoek's work.[73] In Ford's opinion, Leeuwenhoek remained imperfectly understood, the popular view that his work was crude and undisciplined at odds with the evidence of conscientious and painstaking observation. He constructed rational and repeatable experimental procedures and was willing to oppose received opinion, such as spontaneous generation, and he changed his mind in the light of evidence.[39]/nOn his importance in the history of microbiology and science in general, the British biochemist Nick Lane wrote that he was \"the first even to think of looking\u2014certainly, the first with the power to see.\" His experiments were ingenious, and he was \"a scientist of the highest calibre\", attacked by people who envied him or \"scorned his unschooled origins\", not helped by his secrecy about his methods.[29]/nThe Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital in Amsterdam, named after Van Leeuwenhoek, is specialized in oncology.[74] In 2004, a public poll in the Netherlands to determine the greatest Dutchman (\"De Grootste Nederlander\") named Van Leeuwenhoek the 4th-greatest Dutchman of all time.[75]/nOn 24 October 2016, Google commemorated the 384th anniversary of Van Leeuwenhoek's birth with a Doodle that depicted his discovery of \"little animals\" or animalcules, now known as unicellular organisms.[76]/nThe Leeuwenhoek Medal, Leeuwenhoek Lecture, Leeuwenhoek crater, Leeuwenhoeckia, Levenhookia (a genus in the family Stylidiaceae), Leeuwenhoekiella (an aerobic bacterial genus), and the scientific publication Antonie van Leeuwenhoek: International Journal of General and Molecular Microbiology are named after him.[77]", "9238": "Ernst Walter Mayr (/\u02c8ma\u026a\u0259r/; 5 July 1904 \u2013 3 February 2005)[1][2] was one of the 20th century's leading evolutionary biologists. He was also a renowned taxonomist, tropical explorer, ornithologist, philosopher of biology, and historian of science.[3] His work contributed to the conceptual revolution that led to the modern evolutionary synthesis of Mendelian genetics, systematics, and Darwinian evolution, and to the development of the biological species concept./nAlthough Charles Darwin and others posited that multiple species could evolve from a single common ancestor, the mechanism by which this occurred was not understood, creating the species problem. Ernst Mayr approached the problem with a new definition for species. In his book Systematics and the Origin of Species (1942) he wrote that a species is not just a group of morphologically similar individuals, but a group that can breed only among themselves, excluding all others. When populations within a species become isolated by geography, feeding strategy, mate choice, or other means, they may start to differ from other populations through genetic drift and natural selection, and over time may evolve into new species. The most significant and rapid genetic reorganization occurs in extremely small populations that have been isolated (as on islands)./nHis theory of peripatric speciation (a more precise form of allopatric speciation which he advanced), based on his work on birds, is still considered a leading mode of speciation, and was the theoretical underpinning for the theory of punctuated equilibrium, proposed by Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould. Mayr is sometimes credited with inventing modern philosophy of biology, particularly the part related to evolutionary biology, which he distinguished from physics due to its introduction of (natural) history into science./nMayr was the second son of Helene Pusinelli and Otto Mayr. His father was a district prosecuting attorney at W\u00fcrzburg[4] but took an interest in natural history and took the children out on field trips. Mayr learnt all the local birds in W\u00fcrzburg from his elder brother Otto. He also had access to a natural history magazine for amateurs, Kosmos. His father died just before he was thirteen. The family then moved to Dresden, where he studied at the Staatsgymnasium in Dresden-Neustadt and completed his high school education. In April 1922, while still in high school, he joined the newly founded Saxony Ornithologists' Association. There he met Rudolf Zimmermann, who became his ornithological mentor. In February 1923, Mayr passed his high school examination (Abitur) and his mother rewarded him with a pair of binoculars.[5]/nOn 23 March 1923 on one of the lakes of Moritzburg, the Frauenteich, he spotted what he identified as a red-crested pochard. The species had not been seen in Saxony since 1845 and the local club argued about the identity. Raimund Schelcher (1891\u20131979) of the club then suggested that Mayr visit his classmate Erwin Stresemann on his way to Greifswald, where Mayr was to begin his medical studies.[5] After a tough interrogation, Stresemann accepted and published the sighting as authentic. Stresemann was very impressed and suggested that, between semesters, Mayr could work as a volunteer in the ornithological section of the museum. Mayr wrote about this event, \"It was as if someone had given me the key to heaven.\"[5] He entered the University of Greifswald in 1923 and, according to Mayr himself, \"took the medical curriculum (to satisfy a family tradition) but after only a year, he decided to leave medicine and enrolled at the Faculty of Biological Sciences.\"[6] Mayr was endlessly interested in ornithology and \"chose Greifswald at the Baltic for my studies for no other reason than that ... it was situated in the ornithologically most interesting area.\"[6] Although he ostensibly planned to become a physician, he was \"first and foremost an ornithologist.\"[6] During the first semester break Stresemann gave him a test to identify treecreepers and Mayr was able to identify most of the specimens correctly. Stresemann declared that Mayr \"was a born systematist\".[7] In 1925, Stresemann suggested that he give up his medical studies, in fact he should leave the faculty of medicine and enrol into the faculty of Biology and then join the Berlin Museum with the prospect of bird-collecting trips to the tropics, on the condition that he completed his doctoral studies in 16 months. Mayr completed his doctorate in ornithology at the University of Berlin under Dr. Carl Zimmer, who was a full professor (Ordentlicher Professor), on 24 June 1926 at the age of 21. On 1 July he accepted the position offered to him at the museum for a monthly salary of 330.54 Reichsmark.[8]/nAt the International Zoological Congress at Budapest in 1927, Mayr was introduced by Stresemann to banker and naturalist Walter Rothschild, who asked him to undertake an expedition to New Guinea on behalf of himself and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. In New Guinea, Mayr collected several thousand bird skins (he named 26 new bird species during his lifetime) and, in the process also named 38 new orchid species. During his stay in New Guinea, he was invited to accompany the Whitney South Sea Expedition to the Solomon Islands. Also, while in New Guinea, he visited the Lutheran missionaries Otto Thiele and Christian Keyser, in the Finschhafen district; there, while in conversation with his hosts, he uncovered the discrepancies in Hermann Detzner's popular book Four Years among Cannibals: New Guinea, in which Detzner claimed to have seen the interior, discovered several species of flora and fauna, while remaining only steps ahead of the Australian patrols sent to capture him. He returned to Germany in 1930./nMayr moved to the United States in 1931 to take up a curatorial position at the American Museum of Natural History, where he played the important role of brokering and acquiring the Walter Rothschild collection of bird skins, which was being sold in order to pay off a blackmailer. During his time at the museum he produced numerous publications on bird taxonomy, and in 1942 his first book Systematics and the Origin of Species, which completed the evolutionary synthesis started by Darwin./nAfter Mayr was appointed at the American Museum of Natural History, he influenced American ornithological research by mentoring young birdwatchers. Mayr was surprised at the differences between American and German birding societies. He noted that the German society was \"far more scientific, far more interested in life histories and breeding bird species, as well as in reports on recent literature.\"[9]/nMayr organized a monthly seminar under the auspices of the Linnean Society of New York. Under the influence of J.A. Allen, Frank Chapman, and Jonathan Dwight, the society concentrated on taxonomy and later became a clearing house for bird banding and sight records.[9]/nMayr encouraged his Linnaean Society seminar participants to take up a specific research project of their own. Under Mayr's influence one of them, Joseph Hickey, went on to write A Guide to Birdwatching (1943). Hickey remembered later, \"Mayr was our age and invited on all our field trips. The heckling of this German foreigner was tremendous, but he gave tit for tat, and any modern picture of Dr E. Mayr as a very formal person does not square with my memory of the 1930s. He held his own.\" A group of eight young birdwatchers from The Bronx later became the Bronx County Bird Club, led by Ludlow Griscom. \"Everyone should have a problem\" was the way one Bronx County Bird Club member recalled Mayr's refrain.[9] Mayr said of his own involvement with the local birdwatchers: \"In those early years in New York when I was a stranger in a big city, it was the companionship and later friendship which I was offered in the Linnean Society that was the most important thing in my life.\"[9]/nMayr also greatly influenced the American ornithologist Margaret Morse Nice. Mayr encouraged her to correspond with European ornithologists and helped her in her landmark study on song sparrows. Nice wrote to Joseph Grinnell in 1932, trying to get foreign literature reviewed in the Condor: \"Too many American ornithologists have despised the study of the living bird; the magazines and books that deal with the subject abound in careless statements, anthropomorphic interpretations, repetition of ancient errors, and sweeping conclusions from a pitiful array of facts.\u00a0 ... in Europe the study of the living bird is taken seriously. We could learn a great deal from their writing.\" Mayr ensured that Nice could publish her two-volume Studies in the Life History of the Song Sparrow. He found her a publisher, and her book was reviewed by Aldo Leopold, Joseph Grinnell, and Jean Delacour. Nice dedicated her book to \"My Friend Ernst Mayr.\"[9]/nMayr joined the faculty of Harvard University in 1953, where he also served as director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology from 1961 to 1970. He retired in 1975 as emeritus professor of zoology, showered with honors. Following his retirement, he went on to publish more than 200 articles, in a variety of journals\u2014more than some reputable scientists publish in their entire careers; 14 of his 25 books were published after he was 65. Even as a centenarian, he continued to write books. On his 100th birthday, he was interviewed by Scientific American magazine./nMayr died on 3 February 2005 in his retirement home in Bedford, Massachusetts, after a short illness. He had married fellow German Margarete \"Gretel\" Simon in May 1935 (they had met at a party in Manhattan in 1932), and she assisted Mayr in some of his work./nMargarete died in 1990. He was survived by two daughters (Christa Menzel and Susanne Harrison), five grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.[10][11]/nThe awards that Mayr received include the National Medal of Science, the Balzan Prize, the Sarton Medal of the History of Science Society, the International Prize for Biology, the Loye and Alden Miller Research Award, and the Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science. In 1939 he was elected a Corresponding Member of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union. He was awarded the 1946 Leidy Award from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.[12] He was awarded the Linnean Society of London's prestigious Darwin-Wallace Medal in 1958 and the Linnaean Society of New York's inaugural Eisenmann Medal in 1983. For his work, Animal Species and Evolution, he was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1967.[13] Mayr was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1988.[1] In 1995 he received the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Distinguished Achievement in the Sciences of the American Philosophical Society, of which he was already a member.[14][15]\nMayr never won a Nobel Prize, but he noted that there is no prize for evolutionary biology and that Darwin would not have received one, either. (In fact, there is no Nobel Prize for biology.) Mayr did win a 1999 Crafoord Prize. It honors basic research in fields that do not qualify for Nobel Prizes and is administered by the same organization as the Nobel Prize. In 2001, Mayr received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[16]/nMayr was co-author of six global reviews of bird species new to science (listed below)./nMayr said he was an atheist in regards to \"the idea of a personal God\" because \"there is nothing that supports [it]\".[17]/nAs a traditionally-trained biologist, Mayr was often highly critical of early mathematical approaches to evolution, such as those of J.B.S. Haldane, and famously called such approaches \"beanbag genetics\" in 1959. He maintained that factors such as reproductive isolation had to be taken into account. In a similar fashion, Mayr was also quite critical of molecular evolution studies such as those of Carl Woese. Current molecular studies in evolution and speciation indicate that although allopatric speciation is the norm, there are numerous cases of sympatric speciation in groups with greater mobility, such as birds. The precise mechanisms of sympatric speciation, however, are usually a form of microallopatry enabled by variations in niche occupancy among individuals within a population./nIn many of his writings, Mayr rejected reductionism in evolutionary biology, arguing that evolutionary pressures act on the whole organism, not on single genes, and that genes can have different effects depending on the other genes present. He advocated a study of the whole genome, rather than of only isolated genes. After articulating the biological species concept in 1942, Mayr played a central role in the species problem debate over what was the best species concept. He staunchly defended the biological species concept against the many definitions of \"species\" that others proposed./nMayr was an outspoken defender of the scientific method and was known to critique sharply science on the edge. As a notable example, in 1995, he criticized the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI), as conducted by fellow Harvard professor Paul Horowitz, as being a waste of university and student resources for its inability to address and answer a scientific question. Over 60 eminent scientists, led by Carl Sagan, rebutted the criticism.[18][19]/nMayr rejected the idea of a gene-centered view of evolution and starkly but politely criticised Richard Dawkins's ideas:/nThe funny thing is if in England, you ask a man in the street who the greatest living Darwinian is, he will say Richard Dawkins. And indeed, Dawkins has done a marvelous job of popularizing Darwinism. But Dawkins' basic theory of the gene being the object of evolution is totally non-Darwinian. I would not call him the greatest Darwinian./nMayr insisted that the entire genome should be considered as the target of selection, rather than individual genes:/nThe idea that a few people have about the gene being the target of selection is completely impractical; a gene is never visible to natural selection, and in the genotype, it is always in the context with other genes, and the interaction with those other genes make a particular gene either more favorable or less favorable. In fact, Dobzhansky, for instance, worked quite a bit on so-called lethal chromosomes which are highly successful in one combination, and lethal in another. Therefore people like Dawkins in England who still think the gene is the target of selection are evidently wrong. In the 30s and 40s, it was widely accepted that genes were the target of selection, because that was the only way they could be made accessible to mathematics, but now we know that it is really the whole genotype of the individual, not the gene. Except for that slight revision, the basic Darwinian theory hasn't changed in the last 50 years./nDarwin's theory of evolution is based on key facts and the inferences drawn from them, which Mayr summarised as follows:[28]/nIn relation to the publication of Darwin's Origins of Species, Mayr identified philosophical implications of evolution:[29]", "55911448": "Ram Rajasekharan (born 25 December 1960) is an Indian plant biologist, food technologist and a former director of the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), a constituent laboratory of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.

When Edward Pole died, Darwin married Elizabeth and moved to her home, Radbourne Hall, four miles (6.4\u00a0km) west of Derby. The hall and village are these days known as Radbourne.

Dr. Fox, of Derby, considers the disease which occasioned it to have been angina pectoris; but Dr. Garlicke, of the same place, thinks this opinion not sufficiently well founded.

This took seven years. The result was two publications: A System of Vegetables between 1783 and 1785, and The Families of Plants in 1787. In these volumes, Darwin coined many of the English names of plants that we use today.[14]/nDarwin then wrote The Loves of the Plants, a long poem, which was a popular rendering of Linnaeus'  works. Darwin also wrote Economy of Vegetation, and together the two were published as The Botanic Garden. Among other writers he influenced were Anna Seward and Maria Jacson./nDarwin's most important scientific work, Zoonomia (1794\u20131796), contains a system of pathology and a chapter on 'Generation'. In the latter, he anticipated some of the views of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, which foreshadowed the modern theory of evolution. Erasmus Darwin's works were read and commented on by his grandson Charles Darwin the naturalist. Erasmus Darwin based his theories on David Hartley's psychological theory of associationism.[15] The essence of his views is contained in the following passage, which he follows up with the conclusion that one and the same kind of living filament is and has been the cause of all organic life:/nWould it be too bold to imagine, that in the great length of time, since the earth began to exist, perhaps millions of ages before the commencement of the history of mankind, would it be too bold to imagine, that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which THE GREAT FIRST CAUSE endued with animality, with the power of acquiring new parts, attended with new propensities, directed by irritations, sensations, volitions, and associations; and thus possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering down those improvements by generation to its posterity, world without end![16]/nErasmus Darwin also anticipated survival of the fittest in Zo\u00f6nomia mainly when writing about the \"three great objects of desire\" for every organism: \"lust, hunger, and security.\"[16] A similar \"survival of the fittest\" view in Zo\u00f6nomia is Erasmus' view on how a species \"should\" propagate itself. Erasmus' idea that \"the strongest and most active animal should propagate the species, which should thence become improved\".[16] Today, this is called the theory of survival of the fittest. His grandson Charles Darwin posited the different and fuller theory of natural selection. Charles' theory was that natural selection is the inheritance of changed genetic characteristics that are better adaptations to the environment; these are not necessarily based in \"strength\" and \"activity\", which themselves ironically can lead to the overpopulation that results in natural selection yielding nonsurvivors of genetic traits./nErasmus Darwin was familiar with the earlier proto-evolutionary thinking of James Burnett, Lord Monboddo, and cited him in his 1803 work Temple of Nature./nErasmus Darwin offered the first glimpse of his theory of evolution, obliquely, in a question at the end of a long footnote to his popular poem The Loves of the Plants (1789), which was republished throughout the 1790s in several editions as The Botanic Garden. His poetic concept was to anthropomorphise the stamen (male) and pistil (female) sexual organs, as bride and groom. In this stanza on the flower Curcuma (also Flax and Turmeric) the \"youths\" are infertile, and he devotes the footnote to other examples of neutered organs in flowers, insect castes, and finally associates this more broadly with many popular and well-known cases of vestigial organs (male nipples, the third and fourth wings of flies, etc.)/nWoo'd with long care, CURCUMA cold and shy\nMeets her fond husband with averted eye:\nFour beardless youths the obdurate beauty move\nWith soft attentions of Platonic love./nDarwin's final long poem, The Temple of Nature was published posthumously in 1803. The poem was originally titled The Origin of Society. It is considered his best poetic work. It centres on his own conception of evolution. The poem traces the progression of life from micro-organisms to civilised society. The poem contains a passage that describes the struggle for existence.[17]/nHis poetry was admired by Wordsworth, while Coleridge was intensely critical, writing, \"I absolutely nauseate Darwin's poem\".[13]\nIt often made reference to his interests in science; for example botany and steam engines./nThe last two leaves of Darwin's A plan for the conduct of female education in boarding schools (1797) contain a book list, an apology for the work, and an advert for \"Miss Parkers School\".[18]/nThe school advertised on the last page is the one he set up in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, for his two illegitimate children, Susanna and Mary./nDarwin regretted that a good education had not been generally available to women in Britain in his time, and drew on the ideas of Locke, Rousseau, and Genlis in organising his thoughts. Addressing the education of middle-class girls, Darwin argued that amorous romance novels were inappropriate and that they should seek simplicity in dress. He contends that young women should be educated in schools, rather than privately at home, and learn appropriate subjects. These subjects include physiognomy, physical exercise, botany, chemistry, mineralogy, and experimental philosophy. They should familiarise themselves with arts and manufactures through visits to sites like Coalbrookdale, and Wedgwood's potteries; they should learn how to handle money, and study modern languages. Darwin's educational philosophy took the view that men and women should have different capabilities, skills, interests, and spheres of action, where the woman's education was designed to support and serve male accomplishment and financial reward, and to relieve him of daily responsibility for children and the chores of life.[19] In the context of the times, this program may be read as a modernising influence in the sense that the woman was at least to learn about the \"man's world\", although not be allowed to participate in it. The text was written seven years after A Vindication of the Rights of Woman by Mary Wollstonecraft, which has the central argument that women should be educated in a rational manner to give them the opportunity to contribute to society./nSome women of Darwin's era were receiving more substantial education and participating in the broader world. An example is Susanna Wright, who was raised in Lancashire and became an American colonist associated with the Midlands Enlightenment. It is not known whether Darwin and Wright knew each other, although they definitely knew many people in common. Other women who received substantial education and who participated in the broader world (albeit sometimes anonymously) whom Darwin definitely knew were Maria Jacson and Anna Seward./nThese dates indicate the year in which Darwin became friends with these people, who, in turn, became members of the Lunar Society. The Lunar Society existed from 1765 to 1813./nBefore 1765:/nAfter 1765:/nDarwin also established a lifelong friendship with Benjamin Franklin, who shared Darwin's support for the American and French revolutions. The Lunar Society was instrumental as an intellectual driving force behind England's Industrial Revolution./nThe members of the Lunar Society, and especially Darwin, opposed the slave trade. He attacked it in The Botanic Garden (1789\u20131791), and in The Loves of Plants (1789), The Economy of Vegetation (1791), and the Phytologia (1800).[20]/nIn 1761, Darwin was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.[1]/nIn addition to the Lunar Society, Erasmus Darwin belonged to the influential Derby Philosophical Society, as did his brother-in-law Samuel Fox (see family tree below). He experimented with the use of air and gases to alleviate infections and cancers in patients. A Pneumatic Institution was established at Clifton in 1799 for clinically testing these ideas. He conducted research into the formation of clouds, on which he published in 1788. He also inspired Robert Weldon's Somerset Coal Canal caisson lock./nIn 1792, Darwin was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia.[21]/nPercy Bysshe Shelley specifically mentions Darwin in the first sentence of the 1818 Preface to Frankenstein to support his contention that the creation of life is possible. His wife Mary Shelley in her introduction to the 1831 edition of Frankenstein wrote that she overheard her husband talk about Darwin's experiments with Lord Byron about unspecified \"experiments of Dr. Darwin\" that led to the idea for the novel.[22]/nContemporary literature dates the cosmological theories of the Big Bang and Big Crunch to the 19th and 20th centuries. However, Erasmus Darwin had speculated on these sorts of events in The Botanic Garden, A Poem in Two Parts: Part 1, The Economy of Vegetation, 1791:[23]/nRoll on, ye Stars! exult in youthful prime,\nMark with bright curves the printless steps of Time;\nNear and more near your beamy cars approach,\nAnd lessening orbs on lessening orbs encroach; \u2014\nFlowers of the sky! ye too to age must yield,\nFrail as your silken sisters of the field.\nStar after star from Heaven's high arch shall rush,\nSuns sink on suns, and systems, systems crush,\nHeadlong, extinct, to one dark centre fall,\nAnd death and night and chaos mingle all:\n\u2014 Till o'er the wreck, emerging from the storm,\nImmortal Nature lifts her changeful form,\nMounts from her funeral pyre on wings of flame,\nAnd soars and shines, another and the same!/nDarwin was the inventor of several devices, though he did not patent any: he believed this would damage his reputation as a doctor. He encouraged his friends to patent their own modifications of his designs.[24]/nIn notes dating to 1779, Darwin made a sketch of a simple hydrogen-oxygen rocket engine, with gas tanks connected by plumbing and pumps to an elongated combustion chamber and expansion nozzle, a concept not to be seen again until one century later.[27][28]/n/nErasmus Darwin House, his home in Lichfield, Staffordshire, is a museum dedicated to him and his life's work.

She began by observing and collecting bird and animal specimens in California and joined the San Diego Society of Natural History (San Diego Natural History Museum) in 1878 as an associate member.[1][7] Smith became the first woman with full membership in the Society in 1879, and also served as the Society's librarian and recording secretary for several years during the 1880s.[8]/nSmith met David Starr Jordan, a noted ichthyologist from Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, while he was visiting San Diego in 1879. The circumstances of their meeting are uncertain, but Jordan may have heard Smith read her paper at a meeting of the San Diego Society of Natural History about a new species of fish.[9] At about this time, she had discovered the blind goby Othonops eos living in caves underneath Point Loma Peninsula. Jordan was impressed and encouraged her to continue her studies as one of his zoology students at IU. Smith accepted Jordan's offer, and spent the summer of 1880 touring Europe with Jordan and some of his colleagues and students. After returning to the United States, she spent two years studying at IU before an illness in the family caused her to return to San Diego in 1882 without earning an undergraduate degree.[5][1]/nSmith met fellow IU student Carl H.

In addition, the Smithsonian Institution had asked her to make a collection of surf perch from the San Diego area.[1][6] With her family's involvement in newspaper publishing in California, it is not surprising that she also worked as a journalist, becoming a reporter for the San Diego Union, possibly its first woman reporter, while continuing to write and edit scholarly papers.[12]/nFollowing Smith's marriage to Carl Eigenmann in 1887, the couple immediately left for Harvard University, where they studied the Agassiz collections of South American fishes and collaborated on research.

Evelyn Hutchinson, he completed his doctoral thesis on the copper cycle of lakes in Connecticut. Subsequently, he continued to be interested in the productivity of lakes, but gradually expanded his studies to encompass salt water, ultimately moving into biological oceanography./nRiley's oceanographic work focused on the influences affecting the population ecology of plankton systems in coastal and open ocean waters.  His early work correlated phytoplankton production with regulating factors such as nutrients, light and zooplankton abundance.  From this empirical base he went on to develop ecosystem models that explained the annual cycle of plankton ecosystems, most notably in his analysis of the Georges Bank region.[3] His final publication concerned patchiness in plankton,[4] the potential role of diel vertical migration in this, and reflected on what this implied for plankton modelling studies, including his own 1946 study.[3]/nAfter an extended period at Yale, in 1965 Riley moved to become a professor, and the director, at the Institute of Oceanography at Dalhousie University.

He began working with J\u00fcrgen Aschoff at the age of 17.[1]/nRoenneberg attended both the University College London and Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich where he began by studying physics. He switched to medicine in order to focus on the science of the human body, but ended up studying biology. As a postdoctoral fellow, he studied again under J\u00fcrgen Aschoff, studying annual rhythms in the body, then moved to the United States to study the cellular basis of biological clocks under Woody Hastings at Harvard University.[1]/nIn 1991, he began the tradition of giving the Aschoff's Ruler prize to a chronobiologist who has advanced the field.[2]/nHe is currently the vice-chair of the Institute for Medical Psychology of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, the head of the Centre for Chronobiology, the president-elect of the European Biological Rhythms Society, the president of the World Federation of Societies for Chronobiology, and a member of the Senior Common Room of Brasenose College, University of Oxford. From 2005 to 2010 he was the coordinator of \"EUCLOCK\" and coordinator of the Daimler-Benz-Foundation network \"ClockWORK\", and from 2010 to 2012 was the member at large of the Society for Research of Biological Rhythms[3]/nAside from human chronobiology, Roenneberg has significantly contributed to other aspects of the chronobiology field. He has done extensive work on dinoflagellates, a unicellular organism, and has been able to show that even this simple organism is capable of possessing two independent rhythms, providing evidence that a single cell can have two different oscillators. In addition, his work on dinoflagellates has been able to show that these two independent oscillators differ to a significant extent in that they respond differently when treated with various light pulses. They found that the two oscillators have varying sensitivities to different types of light. The B-oscillator is most sensitive to blue light while the A oscillator is sensitive to both blue and red light.[4][5][6]/nRoenneberg has also completed work on Neurospora crassa, determining the masking qualities of entrainment through a Frequency (gene)-null circadian oscillator. He observed in the period of spore production (conidia bands) the phenomenon of masking, an unexpected effect on circadian entrainment due to a particular zeitgeber (such as light[7] or temperature). Masking has significant implications not only for future studies \u2013 which must attempt to demask affected data \u2013 but also in relation to entrainment in everyday life.[8]/nOne of Till Roenneberg's most renowned accomplishments is the development of the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ). As a collaboration with Martha Merrow at LMU Munchen, the MCTQ samples sleep and circadian rhythm data from more than 25,000 participants. Unlike other chronotyping methods, which address the psychology of sleep, the MCTQ measures the phase angle of entrainment,[9] the difference between an organism's intrinsic circadian period and the environmental light cycle. Thus, this questionnaire is the first to use a biological foundation, rather than psychology to determine the basis of sleep schedules.[10]/nQuestions about work day and free day sleep schedules, work details, and lifestyle provide data to aid in the understanding of the interplay of biological clocks and social influences. Such research has led Roenneberg to his theory of social jet lag. The MCTQ categorizes each participant into one of seven chronotype groups and utilizes data on participants\u2019 midsleep phase and sleep debt to survey what \u201ctype\u201d of sleeper each person is, such as late sleepers, slightly late sleepers, early sleepers, and others. From these data, the MCTQ offers methods to make up for sleep debt (if any), and offers suggestions on what to do to wake up earlier or sleep later./nThis chronotype questionnaire is important because it delves into the social aspects of circadian rhythms. By testing behavior rather than directly testing genetic factors, the MCTQ may offer new information regarding how the effects of external factors, including geographic location, seasons, obesity, social jet lag, or shift work,[11] may relate to genetic predispositions of circadian rhythms.[12]/nRoenneberg released a book in March 2012 titled Internal Time: Chronotypes, Social Jet Lag, and Why You're So Tired where he explains the concepts behind circadian rhythm to the masses. One of the major points in his book is, \"Early birds and night owls are born, not made.\"[1]   Roenneberg wanted to rid people of labels such as \"lazy\" that frequently get placed upon those who wake up late. With this book, he wanted to deliver his point that these sleep patterns are due to people's genetics and are not from choice. He discusses how everyone is born with an internal clock, and living a lifestyle in dissonance with this inherent biological clock puts individuals at greater risk for health problems. Roenneberg introduces the term \u201csocial jet lag,\" saying it is more dangerous than normal jet lag because social jet lag forces individuals to persistently go against their biological clock in a consistent light/dark cycle.  In this book, he defines social jet lag as \u201cthe difference between midsleep on free days and midsleep on work days.\" Free days are defined as days without an alarm clock, where one naturally wakes up, and work days where one wakes up with an alarm clock. Midsleep is defined as the midpoint of an individual's sleeping period.[13] One of the significant health risks of social jet lag is obesity,[14] and Roenneberg claims that for every hour of social jet lag, the probability of being overweight increases by approximately 33%.[15] In fact, social jet lag is so prevalent that Roenneberg claims that 87% of the population of Central Europe suffers from social jet lag to some degree.[1][16]/nRoenneberg also claims that adolescents, biologically, have an internal clock that causes their midsleep to fall later than young infants and adults. Thus, teenagers are not lazy, but are simply following their internal rhythms by going to sleep later and waking up later. This late midsleep pattern changes after adolescence, but at different points for men and women. Women's midsleep changes around age eighteen, while men's midsleep changes at the age of twenty-one. Forcing teenagers to wake up early, against their internal rhythms, leads to stress. As many studies have shown, stress leads to unhealthy decisions such as smoking and drinking.[17]/nSome of Roenneberg's publications include:[18][19]", "35759231": "Miroslav Zei (25 July 1914 \u2013 2 November 2006) was a Slovene biologist, specialist in marine biology, oceanography and ichthyology./nZei was born in Nabre\u017eina near Trieste in 1914.

In 2009, its name changed to the World Transformation Movement.[26]/nIn 1995, Griffith, Macartney-Snape and the Foundation for Humanity's Adulthood (the World Transformation Movement's name at the time) were the subject of an Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) Four Corners program[4] and a Sydney Morning Herald newspaper article in which it was alleged that Macartney-Snape used speaking appearances at schools to promote the foundation, which was described as a cult, and that Griffith \"publishes work of such a poor standard that it has no support at all from the scientific community\".[27]/nIn 1998, the Australian Broadcasting Authority censured the ABC for unbalanced and inaccurate reporting and breaching the ABC code of practice, with The Bulletin describing the Four Corners program as a \"hatchet job\".[5] Griffith objected to being described as a \"prophet of the posh\" and portrayed as a form of deity as he was during the media controversy, but he was comfortable being referred to as a prophet in a secular sense, and he regards many contemporary thinkers as prophets, including\u00a0James Darling, Charles Darwin, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Thomas Huxley, Stephen Hawking and Laurens van der Post.[5][22]/nBoth the ABC and Herald publications became the subject of defamation actions in the NSW Supreme Court.[28][29] In 2007, the ABC was ordered to pay Macartney-Snape almost $500,000 in damages, and with costs, the payout was expected to exceed $1 million.[29] The jury found that what the ABC said about Griffith was defamatory (it would tend to disgrace Griffith or lower public opinion of him),[30] but the judge dismissed the case after the defences of truth, qualified privilege and comment were considered.[29][31][32] Griffith appealed that decision, and the NSW Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal[33][34] on the basis of qualified privilege and comment being upheld, but it found that the defamatory allegation that the ABC made about Griffith was not justified.[35][4] The proceedings against the Herald were resolved when it published an apology to the foundation in 2009.[36]/nIn 2020, an article by Griffith published in The Spectator Australia under the heading 'The science of bushfires'[37] about his biological analysis of the dangers of eucalypts in light of the 2019\u201320 Australian bushfire season resulted in him appearing on Alan Jones's 2GB radio program,[38] and on the Richo & Jones Sky News Australia television program.[39] Griffith's analysis also generated interest in the United Kingdom.[40]", "25765040": "Oscar Riddle (September 27, 1877 \u2013 November 29, 1968) was an American biologist.  He is known for his research into the pituitary gland and for isolating the hormone prolactin./nRiddle was born and raised on a farm in Cincinnati, Indiana, where he was one of eight siblings. He received a B.S. in biology from Indiana University in 1902 and a PhD in zoology at the University of Chicago in 1907. He taught physiology and biology in Saint Louis, Missouri and Puerto Rico, and he embarked on natural history expeditions to the Orinoco River in South America and Cuba. In 1912 he was appointed a research associate at the Carnegie Institution's Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island.[1][2] He stayed with the Cold Spring Harbour institution for the rest of his career, until his retirement in 1945./nRiddle was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1926, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1934,[3] and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1939.[4]/nOscar Riddle published many dozens of original research reports in the 30 years 1916-1945.[2] His research spanned endocrinology, the physiology of reproduction, animal pigmentation, and the nature and functional basis of sex. He is most remembered for his research into the major pituitary hormone prolactin. It was shown by other researchers in 1928 that an aqueous mash of pituitary cells can induce lactation in female mammals. Riddle and his colleagues were the first to isolate prolactin, which was named by Riddle in 1932.[2][5] Also around 1932 Riddle was earliest to show that the prolactin protein induces the secretion of crop milk in pigeons and other birds.[2] During the 1930s he participated in leading-edge demonstrations on the effects of prolactin injections in animals.[2]/nRiddle was a devout atheist and held the conviction that religion poses a serious threat to scientific advancements.[6] He garnered national attention for a speech debunking superstition in 1936. His speech was delivered to the American Association for the Advancement of Science and was published in the journal Science and covered by the New York Times. Riddle was featured on the cover of Time (magazine) in January 1939.[citation needed] In 1958, Riddle was named the Humanist of the Year by the American Humanist Association.

Erdmann's work centered around the reproduction of protozoa, with a particular interest in tissue culture and in vitro cellular reproduction. Her work as a protozoologist earned her a graduate student lecturing position at Yale University, though her time in America was cut short by anti-German sentiment surrounding World War I. After a forcible incarceration and then deportation in 1919, Erdmann took a research position at the Institute for Cancer Research at the Charit\u00e9 Hospital of the Friedrich\u2010Wilhelms University of Berlin.  There she instituted the first department for experimental cytology in Germany.  She worked at the University for almost 10 years before receiving on official professorship in 1929. Her work was interrupted yet again with the rise of Nazism in 1933, when she was stripped of her professorship position. She died in Berlin in 1935./nAfter passing the required examination in 1892, she moved first to England and then later Romania to work as a teacher, ultimately ending with a position at a Volksschule in Hamburg in 1899. In 1900, she earned first-class honors in the examination for teaching.[3]/nIn 1903, Erdmann left her teaching position to continue her studies. She took courses in zoology and botany in Berlin, Zurich, Marburg and Munich. She worked with living animal materials at the Naples Zoological Station, and passed the university qualifying examination in 1907 which she received from the Realgymnasium in Kassel (Hessen). She received a Ph.D. in biology from the University of Munich in 1908, working in the laboratory of Richard Hertwig. Her dissertation, Experimentelle Untersuchung der Massenverh\u00e4ltnisse von Plasma, Kern und Chromosomen in dem sich entwickelnden Seeigelei, (Experimental investigation of the mass ratios of plasma, nucleus and chromosomes in the developing sea urchin egg)[4] established her career as a protozoologist. She was one of the first women doctoral students in Germany, as women had only been allowed to pursue doctoral research beginning in the year 1900./nAfter receiving her Ph.D., Erdmann went on to work as a research assistant at the Institute for Infectious Diseases at the Robert Koch Institute and Charit\u00e9 Hospital of Berlin, where she worked from 1908 to 1913. Working with August von Wassermann, Erdmann attempted to develop vaccines against Cyanophilia viruses (now recognized at H7 High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza [5]) in chickens.[6]  In 1913, she received a one-year fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation to conduct cytological research at the Osborn Zoological Laboratory at Yale University. At Yale, she worked with Ross Granville Harrison, the noted developmental biologist on methods to propagate cells in vitro.  After her fellowship ended, she received an offer from Harrison to return to Yale as a lecturer\u2014remarkable, given Yale's charter had to be changed to admit a woman as faculty.  From 1915 to 1918, she was a member of the Yale faculty and the first woman member of the Yale Graduate Faculty. In 1915 she was named a research associate at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in Princeton, where she spent summers studying tissue culture techniques. Erdmann was able to successfully culture chicken bone marrow cells as part of her attempts to attenuate the cyanolophia virus.[7] These studies were important for future work in the fields of hematology and virology. In addition, her work on the survival of Paramecium cultures led to important insights on cellular senescence and methods of genetic transmission.[8]/nHer work at Yale and Princeton was interrupted by World War I. Wartime hysteria cast suspicion on German citizens; as a German citizen working in biology, people began to suspect Erdmann of culturing malicious bacteria. In 1918 Erdmann was accused of poisoning the New Haven drinking water supply and introducing chicken cholera to the U.S.[9] She lost her job at Yale in February 1918, and was jailed from May until September, when she was bailed out by Harrison and a number of her female friends.  She was then deported to Germany the following spring.[10]/nErdmann struggled to find work in Germany, and it was a full year before she got a position at the Institute for Cancer Research at the Charit\u00e9 Hospital of the Friedrich\u2010Wilhelms University of Berlin.  There she established a department of experimental cell research, the first of its kind in Germany. She received faculty status in the Zoology department at the university in 1920. She was appointed to the medical faculty in 1923, and promoted to Associate Professor with full civil service status in 1929. In April 1930, her department was officially separated and named the Institute of Experimental Cytology (Institut f\u00fcr  Experimentell Zellforschung), where she served as director./nAt the institute, she introduced tissue culture methods that she had learned in the U.S. Among her many contributions was the demonstration that cancer could be propagated by cell-free filtrates containing viruses [11] She was the first German woman to lead a university institute.[12] Erdmann also founded the periodical Archiv f\u00fcr experimentelle Zellforschung in 1925 and served as its editor until her death. She conceived the idea of an International Society for Experimental Cytology and served as permanent its general secretary.[2]/nWhen the Nazis came to power in 1933, she was banned from laboratory work after having been denounced by the eugenicist Henry Zeiss and the orthopedic surgeon Hermann Gocht, as being Jewish. When this turned out to be untrue, she was accused of helping her Jewish students to secure positions and emigrate.[13] Her institute was then closed and she was forced to retire.[10]  She was jailed in the spring of 1933 for two weeks by the Gestapo, but was released due to international pressure. However, in 1934 the German Government opened another institute for experimental cytology under her direction. She was active until her death, having recently completed a manuscript.[14]/nIn 1992, the German section of the European Tissue Culture Association created a research fund in Dr. Erdmann's name. In 2016, the Rhoda Erdmann House opened on the Life Sciences North Campus of Humbold University of Berlin. Due to its curved shape and green metal facade, the Rhoda Erdmann House on Philippstra\u03b2e is known as the \"Green Amoeba.\"[15]/nAnna Maria Rhoda Erdmann was born in Hersfeld, Hessen, on 5 December 1870.[1]  The daughter of Anna Maria and Dr. Heinrick E. Erdmann (who was a high school teacher), Erdmann grew up in a family of scientists and physicians.[16]  Erdmann attended St. John's school for girls in Hamburg, where she trained to be a teacher of high-school and middle-school aged girls. Erdmann then worked as a teacher for around 9 years before her later career advancements, because it was the nearly the only academically inclined career for women in Germany.[17] Following her long and eventful career in research, Erdmann died in Berlin[10] on 24 August 1935 at the age of 64 from a heart attack.[2]/nRhoda Erdmann is considered a role model and pioneer as she was a member of the first generation of women who were able to pursue a career in the academic field. She was a contributor to a book called \"Leading Women in Europe\" where she spoke of her experiences and the difficulties faced when competing with male scientists.[17] She had the perspective that the views women working in science were often overshadowed by men in the field. Erdmann noticed that women were often assigned simpler routine tasks that kept them too busy to perform their own research. In her biography Erdmann notes that she had to \"carve out her academic standing for herself by hard work\".[17]", "795842": "William Henry Dallinger FRS (5 July 1839 \u2013 7 November 1909) was a British minister in the Wesleyan Methodist Church. He was also an accomplished scientist, being the first to study the complete lifecycle of unicellular organisms under the microscope and studying the adaptation of such organisms to temperature.[1]/nHe made numerous contributions to microscopy, and was president of the Quekett Microscopical Club from 1889 to 1892. Dallinger was awarded three honorary doctorates, the Ll.D. from Victoria College, Toronto in 1884, the D.Sc. from Dublin in 1892, and the D.L.C. from Durham in 1896./nDallinger was married to Emma Ion Goldsmith (1842-1910). They had one child, son Percy Gough (1867-1930)./nDallinger was one of the first to carry out a controlled evolution experiment. In the late 19th century, he cultivated small unicellular organisms in a custom-built incubator over a time period of seven years (1880\u20131886). Dallinger slowly increased the temperature of the incubator from an initial 60\u00a0\u00b0F up to 158\u00a0\u00b0F. The early cultures had shown clear signs of distress at a temperature of 73\u00a0\u00b0F, and were certainly not capable of surviving at 158\u00a0\u00b0F. The organisms Dallinger had in his incubator at the end of the experiment, on the other hand, were perfectly fine at 158\u00a0\u00b0F. However, these organisms would no longer grow at the initial 60\u00a0\u00b0F. Dallinger concluded that he had found evidence for Darwinian adaptation in his incubator, and that the organisms had adapted to live in a high-temperature environment. Unfortunately, Dallinger's incubator was accidentally destroyed in 1886, and Dallinger could not continue this line of research./nDallinger was an early supporter of Darwinism. He accepted natural selection and considered creationism to be \"absolutely untenable\". He believed there was no conflict between religion and science and there was no reason to try and reconcile the Book of Genesis with geology.[2]", "71967942": "Marianne Krall Henderson (born September 1, 1962) is an American biomedical scientist specialized in biobanks and biorepositories.

He met and befriended Lithuanian students here and learned the Lithuanian language./nIn 1905, he moved to Paris, studied at Sorbonne University Nature-history faculty and graduated in 1909. Since 1904 he was a member of the Lithuanian society Lituania. Together with another early twentieth-century Lithuanian activist, Micha\u0142 R\u00f6mer, Ivanauskas gave lectures about Lithuania in Paris in 1905./nIn 1909, he again entered Saint Petersburg University, as Russian Empire did not recognize foreign diplomas, and finished with a first-grade diploma in 1910. During his studies, he was active in Lithuanian student society, and was elected as chairman./nIn 1910, in Saint Petersburg, he established the natural sciences visual devices laboratory Zootom, which prepared various biological, botanical, anatomical and mineralogical devices. In the summertime, he travelled around Lithuania collecting material for his devices. In 1914 and 1917, Ivanauskas participated in scientific expeditions into Northern Russia (Murmansk and Arkhangelsk) and Norway. In 1918 Ivanauskas returned to Lithuania and together with his wife Honorata opened a Lithuanian school./nIn 1920, he moved to Kaunas and worked as an adviser in the Ministry of Agriculture of Lithuania, also helped organize Higher courses, that later became the University of Lithuania. Together with Konstantinas Regelis organized Kaunas Botanical Park in 1923. Together with his wife, he started organizing the annual National day of birds and Tree planting days./nHe was a professor in University of Lithuania (later Vytautas Magnus University) from 1922 until 1940,[2] and in 1929, became the head of the Zoology Department. He became a professor at the re-established Vilnius University between 1940 and 1941. He returned to this position in 1944, which he held until 1956. He simultaneously held a professorship at the Kaunas Medical Institute from 1954 until 1970./nAmong his other achievements, he is known for opening one of the first bird banding stations in Europe, at Vent\u0117 Cape in 1929. He also founded the Zoological Museum in 1918, the Kaunas Botanical Garden in 1923, \u017duvintas reserve in 1937, and the Kaunas Zoo in 1938./nIvanauskas published 37 books and brochures, the most famous of them - Birds of Lithuania. Since 1941 he was a full member of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences./nBorn as Tadeusz Iwanowski in Lebiodka, Grodno Region of today's Belarus, in a Catholic Lithuanian noble family loyal to the heritage of Grand Duchy of Lithuania, he did not know the Lithuanian language until 1905. Even so, Ivanauskas considered himself to be Lithuanian and dedicated his life to Lithuania. He opened the first Lithuanian school with his wife in 1918. There was a noted episode during Polish\u2013Lithuanian War, as one of his brothers during ceasefire transferred Tadas' taxidermical collection through the front line into Lithuania./nThe other three brothers of Ivanauskas identified themselves with the other two nationalities of former Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, two (Jerzy Iwanowski\u00a0[be; pl] - politician and engineer and Stanis\u0142aw Iwanowski - lawyer) chose to become Polish, and one Vac\u0142a\u016d Ivano\u016dski (politician) - Belarusian (although he would live in interwar Poland).", "61416687": "Suranganie Dharmawardhane Flanagan is a Sri Lankan molecular biologist and biochemist.

She researches the architectural features of large RNA molecules and RNA remodeling enzymes using experimental biochemistry and crystallography. such as self-splicing introns and other noncoding RNAs. She has focused her research to understand how large RNAs assemble into specific, stable tertiary structures, and also how ATP-dependent enzymes in the cell recognize and remodel RNA. Specifically, she was successful in crystallizing and solving the structure of a group IIC intron from the bacterium Oceanobacillus iheyensis[5] and moves through the stages of splicing.[6] Pyle's research may be helpful in drug development as RNA's tertiary structure could provide insight into druggable biomolecules.[7][8]", "42231": "Aristid Lindenmayer (17 November 1925 \u2013 30 October 1989) was a Hungarian biologist. In 1968 he developed a type of formal language today called L-systems or Lindenmayer systems. Using those systems Lindenmayer modelled the behaviour of cells of plants. L-systems nowadays are also used to model whole plants./nLindenmayer worked with yeast and filamentous fungi and studied the growth patterns of various types of algae, such as the blue/green bacteria Anabaena catenula. Originally the L-systems were devised to provide a formal description of the development of such simple multicellular organisms, and to illustrate the neighbourhood relationships between plant cells. Later on, this system was extended to describe higher plants and complex branching structures./nLindenmayer studied chemistry and biology at the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University of Budapest from 1943 to 1948.

His works led to the fundamental understanding of cell polarity in response to cell signaling./nAfter the pivotal discovery of PKC by Yasutomi Nishizuka, in the mid 1980s, Ohno and his colleagues found novel PKC isotypes (nPKC) and atypical PKC isotypes (aPKC).[1][2] These findings showed that PKC family plays various rules in cell signaling.[3]/nOn the other hand, the concept of cell polarity arises primarily through the localization of specific proteins to specific areas of the cell membrane. In 1988, Kenneth J. Kemphues and his colleagues identified par (partitioning defective) genes that are involved in cell-fate specification in Caenorhabditis elegans.[4] In the mid 1990s, Kemphues research group cloned Par1 and Par3 genes in C. elegans, showing PAR1 is enriched at the posterior periphery in the cell while PAR3 is found at the anterior periphery./nIn 1998, Ohno's research group found that aPKC is essential for proper asymmetric cell divisions and co-localizes with PAR3 in C. elegans, indicating the relationship between intracellular signal transduction and cell polarity.[5] Also, they discovered aPKC-specific interacting protein, ASIP, which is a mammalian homologue of C. elegans PAR3.[6] These pioneer works led the significant finding of a conserved PAR3-PAR6-aPKC protein complex regulating cell polarity in response to cell signaling.[7][8]/nOhno was born in 1952 in Niigata Prefecture, Japan.
