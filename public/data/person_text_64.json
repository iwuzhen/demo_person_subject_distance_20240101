H. Kent (born December 12, 1945, in Wellington, New Zealand) is a professor at the University of Chicago. While professor at the Scripps Research Institute in the early 1990s he pioneered modern ligation methods for the total chemical synthesis of proteins.[1][2]  He was the inventor of native chemical ligation together with his student Philip Dawson.[3] His laboratory experimentally demonstrated the principle that chemical synthesis of a protein's polypeptide chain using mirror-image amino acids after folding results in a mirror-image protein molecule which, if an enzyme, will catalyze a chemical reaction with mirror-image stereospecificity.[4] At the University of Chicago Kent and his junior colleagues pioneered the elucidation of protein structures by quasi-racemic & racemic crystallography.[5]", "58871046": "Miguel de La Guardia is a Spanish chemist, who is active in the field of analytical chemistry; he is a full professor of the University of Valencia (UV).[1] He is a member of the editorial board of Spectroscopy Letters, Ciencia (Venezuela), Journal of the Brazilian Chemical Society, Bioimpacts (Iran) and SOP Transactions on Nano-technology,[2] and editor-in-chief of Elsevier's Microchemical Journal.[3]", "19727": "Michael Faraday FRS (/\u02c8f\u00e6r\u0259de\u026a, -di/; 22 September 1791\u00a0\u2013 25 August 1867) was an English scientist who contributed to the study of electromagnetism and electrochemistry. His main discoveries include the principles underlying electromagnetic induction, diamagnetism and electrolysis. Although Faraday received little formal education, as a self-made man, he was one of the most influential scientists in history.[1] It was by his research on the magnetic field around a conductor carrying a direct current that Faraday established the concept of the electromagnetic field in physics. Faraday also established that magnetism could affect rays of light and that there was an underlying relationship between the two phenomena.[2][3] He similarly discovered the principles of electromagnetic induction, diamagnetism, and the laws of electrolysis. His inventions of electromagnetic rotary devices formed the foundation of electric motor technology, and it was largely due to his efforts that electricity became practical for use in technology.[4]", "8801551": "Ruth Mary Rogan Benerito (January 12, 1916 \u2013 October 5, 2013) was an American chemist and inventor known for her work related to the textile industry, notably including the development of wash-and-wear cotton fabrics.
