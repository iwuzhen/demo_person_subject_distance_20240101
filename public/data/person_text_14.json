Much of his early work concerned models of sex ratio evolution and a variety of social insects (such as the Vespidae wasps). This work often took the form of mathematical models built from 'first principles' (such as his 1986 paper written with Robert Trivers). Following his PhD he held postdoctoral positions at the University of Sussex (1981-1982), the University of Michigan (1982-1983), and Princeton University (1983\u201386).[4] He joined the faculty at the University of Utah in 1986./nHis latest work concerns applications of coalescent theory to population genetics, particularly the mtDNA of whale lice, although members of his lab work on a variety of applied and theoretical topics that range from evolutionary ecology and genetics to mathematical biology and coalescent theory. In addition, he recently received an NSF grant to continue his work on the so-called \"missing heritability\" problem. His whale lice work had already shown that a genome should have many weakly deleterious mutations of small effect taken on their own but potentially large effect when taken together.

It was published in 1980 in the journal Biotropica. This study focused on the gaps created in tropical rainforests when trees fall, and sought to answer how so many different species of trees can have reproductive success within these gaps. Denslow considered that depending on the severity of the tree fall, the gaps would be made larger or smaller. She suggested that rainforest trees adapted strategies to improve reproductive success by evolving specific traits that increase the rate of seedling success and recruitment in tree fall gaps of certain size ranges\u2014some species may exploit smaller gaps, while others may exploit larger gaps. The size of the gaps affects many other factors in seedling success, such as the amount of light, humidity, and temperature.

Here, Jucci conducted research on cell permeability and ciliary movement in Actinia.[2][3] He returned to the Institute of Physiology at the University of Naples the following year, seconded to the Zoological Station.[1] By 1930, he had won the Chair of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at the University of Sassari. He remained professor and director of the Institute there until his move to the University of Modena in 1932, where he succeeded Daniele Rosa, invertebrate zoologist and hologenomic theorist of evolution (a now outdated theory with similarities to, but distinct from, the modern hologenome theory of evolution). In 1934 he succeeded to the chair of zoology at the University of Pavia, following the death of Cesare Artom, whose studies of the chromosomal and cellular aspects of heredity Jucci wished to build upon.[1][2]/nAs part of the 1939 anniversary celebrations in honor of Lazzaro Spallanzani, Jucci organized a scientific conference in Pavia. The same year, he founded a \"Center of Genetics\" to allow concentration of research and collaboration in experimental genetics. The center was launched alongside a new scientific journal of genetics, Scientia genetica, a periodical with international circulation and wide participation of researchers from Latin countries. This genetics center was merely the forerunner to what was to become Jucci's Institute of Genetics, established in 1941. Within the faculty of science at the University of Pavia, it was the first such Institute in Italy.[2]  He was its director until 1947, being succeeded by Adriano Buzzati Traverso. At Jucci's instigation, a center for the genetic study of alpine animal and plant populations was established on Mount Terminillo, becoming fully operational in 1954.[2] The Apennine center had seven laboratories, a library and museum, in addition to land for experimentation, and housed the Society of Agricultural Genetics.[5]/nA member of several Italian and foreign academies, Jucci died in Rome on 22 October 1962.[1][2]/nIn all his career, Jucci was inspired by the more general themes of biology, such as evolution, the relationships between genetics, embryology and physiology, and ontogenetic development, and was able to achieve remarkable results in the fields of entomology, comparative physiology, and genetics, documented by about two hundred publications.\nAs for the years within the Roman school of Grassi, he shared the research topics with a debut on the biology of Termitids, a topic of great biological interest, to clarify if the multiple forms assumed by the members of the societies of those Insects are already determined in the egg or depend in some way from external factors. \nGrassi argued that the colony could stop and divert the development of a number of individuals, destined to become perfect insects, inducing them to assume the form and functions of workers, soldiers or royalty, varying proportions and qualities of food; others, like the Americans Snyder and Thompson had believed to demolish the results of the scientist supporting an intrinsic differentiation during the ontogenetic development of all individuals./nFrom the experiments that were objects of his thesis and from successive investigations, that carried on also after the transfer to the agricultural school of Portici, directed from a student of Grassi, Anna Fo\u00e0, Jucci could confirm the thesis of the teacher, moreover already taken from Filippo Silvestri. He noted that, when the royals are absent in society, a change in diet causes the development of some nymphs to stop and induces the differentiation of the mature genital organs, giving rise to the replacement or neotenic reals. The most original part of the work deals with the different metabolisms found in the different forms and initiated by tissues with glandular activity and new to the histology of those Insects. \u00a0With the study of excretory functions in real and neotenic, related to histology, and the detection of anabolic and catabolic products in different organisms, Jucci introduced an original method of comparative physiological research./nAdditionally, among other things, he hypothesized that the examination of the structure of the tentorial glands showed an evolution occurred in the phylogenetic path of the group and considered that, although the systematic position of the Termites (derived from cockroaches, about 150 million years ago, in the Mesozoic, they evolved convergently with ants in appearance and social behavior) and very distant hymenopterans, It would be reasonable to rely on it to help explain the phenomena of convergence of social insects./nDiscovered the existence of the tentorial glands in the species Reticulitermes lucifugus, and made a biometric study of them, he theorized that the mediation of hormonal factors induced by a special diet could have taken to the differentiation of the castes./nHe would have been able to reach a broader understanding of the mechanisms of development of insects, confirming his aforementioned hypothesis, if he had continued his researches. Then, Jucci in the agricultural school of Portici turned his interests to the biology of the silkworm, one of the topics most dealt with in the field of breeding, already studied by Italian scientists as Marcello Malpighi and Agostino Bassi but also by scholars active in China and Japan. Thanks to the great variability of the characters, this species can be seen as a privileged material for genetic experimentation that intends to follow its development in various phases./nHe began research on the development of the Bombyx mori by using a comparative physiological method. It was represented by a curve that highlighted the metabolic aspects both in the univoltine breeds, (whose egg develops only after a pause, so that a single generation lives within a year) and in the bi and polyvoltine, (whose egg hatches as soon as it is laid with a sequence of two or more generations in the year), showing that with a different metabolism the growth would be less, meaning passing from univoltine to polyvoltines. He was able to demonstrate that polyvoltinism is a common feature, that the metabolic capacities can vary depending on the ability of the insect to react to the external environment, and that there are many degrees of transition between uni, bi, and polyvoltinism./nStudying the bivoltinism and the tendency of the fertilized egg to direct development, without pauses, Jucci investigated the existence in the silkworm of natural parthenogenesis. He compared various races to highlight the degree of tendency to parthenogenetic development and to understand if these differences correspond to an uninterrupted development. The tendency to parthenogenesis has been related to the metabolic reactivity and capacity of race and individual since he found a proportionality between the two events. The inheritance of physiological characters in development is developed in the memoir on The hereditary behavior of a physiological character in the silkworm (in Bull. Of the Italian Entomological Society, LVIII [1926], 4-5, pp.\u00a036\u201363).\n[6]\nHe related the different colors of the cocoon, linked to the color of the hemolymph, to the metabolism in the different breeds of silkworms./nBy studying the transmission of the colors in different races, he understood that the emergence of a character derives from cellular biochemical processes, as the cocoon\u2019s color that is related to the permeability to certain substances present in food./nThrough On the pigments of blood, cocoons and eggs in silkworms (in Rend. Dell'Acc. Dei Lincei, class of physical sciences, s. 6, XI [1930], pp.\u00a086\u201390) and a comparative examination between two races, he found that even the early or late moment of the migration of the pigment from the blood to the cocoon is following Mendel\u2019s Laws. With the work On the color of the cocoon and migration, he provided the answer to the question about the dominance or recessiveness of genotypic characteristics in the first generation./nIn his book Maternal inheritance studied in the characteristics of silkworms (in Rivista di zootechnical, II 1925, 5, pp.\u00a015\u201323), after many experiments, he criticized the existence of an inheritance linked to the cytoplasm debated by among the geneticists./nWith his later studies in Naples, he highlighted the high degree of natural immunity present in the moth of the hives against acid-resistant bacteria, because of digestive enzymes of the wax and the presence in the intestine of caterpillars. After that, he tried to provoke the same resistance in other animals with a waxy substances diet. In the following years, he expanded his participation in international scientific events and through the research centers he founded he could deepen his investigation.", "22296651": "Dag Olav Hessen (born 6 July 1956) is a Norwegian writer and biologist, known for his work in the field of ecology./nHe is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.[1] He was awarded the Riksm\u00e5l Society Literature Prize in 2008,[citation needed] and the Fritt Ord Honorary Award in 2010.[2]/n/nThis article about a Norwegian scientist is a stub.

He also performed other research projects in regard to food selection by mammals and other areas of animal reproduction and nutrient intake. Dove was a member of the faculty of the University of Maine./nDove was born in Marion, Iowa, on 11 April 1897.[1][2] He earned his B.S. from Iowa State College, in 1922. He earned an M.S. from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison in 1923, and his Ph.D. in 1927.[3]/nThe horn of the unicorn dates back all the way to ancient times where they were sought after by kings and queens because they were believed to have magical powers as an antidote against poisons. The typical description in the mythology of a unicorn would have the head and neck and the fine-boned, graceful legs of the horse; the beard and divided hooves of the Capridae; (part of the Artiodactyla family) the tail of the oryx; and a single spike spiraling from the forehead./nThe artificial production of unicorns has been suggested a number of times in the past. Fran\u00e7ois Levaillant, 1776, in his \"Travels to Africa,\" describes a process of contriving the horns of an ox.\nDuring more contemporary times has there been articles of accounts of so-called \"unicorned\" sheep in Nepal, and what fascinated him was the manner in which they were created. The process adopted was branding with a red-hot iron the male lambs when they are about two or three months old on their horns when they begin to sprout. The wounds are then treated with a mixture of oil and soot and when they heal, instead of growing at their usual places and spreading, they come out as on through the middle of their skull./nAlthough more recently has scientific scrutiny began to arise over these accounts, trying to disprove them. A majority of naturalists are inclined to say that the mere fact of searing the budding horns would not result in those appendages sprouting out at the summit of the skull instead of still sprouting out of sides as in natural horns do. However it is true that horns of a young animal might be induced to grow together by binding them together, but that would still put an unnatural strain on them and make them grow out bony and unnatural, they would not arise smooth and straight out the middle of the skull as stated in previous research./nOn March, 1933, an operation was performed on a day-old male Ayrshire calf. The two horns were cut placed closely together over the frontal stitches at the intersection of the lines drawn from the original horn spouts. The horn buds were trimmed flat. The frontal periosteum it was expected that the two horns would fuse together into one large horn solidly attached to the skull and located above and between the eyes. The experiment was successful, at the age of two years the two buds have formed together into one large horn molded into the forehead for support. What makes this unicorn different from the other ones is all in the horn, unlike the other unicorns the horn spike grew from the skull instead of upon. A single united sheath covers the horn spike, the horn curves slightly upward toward the tip and gracefully extends the curve of the back and neck when the animal stands at attention. Like that of a mythical unicorn described by Ctesias and Fresnel, the horn sheath is white or grayish-white at the base and is tipped with black. (Had the unicorn been a female, the horn would be tipped with red, since the color appears as a sex-limited factor in this particular breed. This Ayrshire bull, whose Scottish ancestors flourished under King James VI, who, as James I of England put the unicorn on England's coat of arms, is a true unicorn. Although it is an animal with the hereditary potentiality for two horns, he recognizes the power of a single horn which he uses as a prow to pass under fences and barriers in his path.[4]/nThe Unibull was one of W. Franklin Dove's more well known experiments. In this experiment he theorized that the horns didn't grow from the skull but grew into the skull over time from horn buds.[citation needed]  In order to test his hypothesis he conducted his experiments on many animals like sheep, cows, and goats, as well as the famous Unibull./nW. Franklin Dove acknowledged that horns don't actually grow from the skull, but instead, they are actually unattached bits of tissue that eventually root their way into the skull. He also did more in-depth research about horns and learned that people before him have been creating \"unicorn\" animals. For example, some sheep were made into single horned sheep by branding two- or three-month-old lambs on their horn buds and then treating them with a mixture of oil and soot while they were healing so that the horns grew from the middle of the skull.[4] So, Dove reasoned that the positioning of the horns is quite open to natural or artificial variation which would mean that \"unicorns\" were not a total contradiction of the laws of nature. To test his theory, he took a day old calf and surgically removed its horn buds and cut them so that they would fit together, and then implanted them in the center of the calf's head. The circular horn buds were trimmed flat at their point of contact so as to provide a larger fusion surface. It was expected that the two horn buds would fuse together to form one large horn solidly attached to the skull and located somewhat between the eyes to mimic the horn of the unicorn. The experiment was proven to be successful as the bull grew the horn buds fused together and started to form a single, straight horn about a foot in length. The horn functioned very well for the bull, perhaps even better than the normal horns the bulls have. The bull eventually became the leader of its herd and was rarely challenged. An interesting side effect of this horn was the bulls abnormally docile personality.[5] He also created \"unicorns\" out of goats as well as cows. Besides making \"unicorns\" he also made tri-horned animals./nOne of Dove's published research articles, \"Developing Food Acceptance Research\", discusses many aspects of the necessity of developing new methods of food research and the relation to food acceptance among individuals. The article was written shortly after World War II and the purpose was to examine the causes of food nonacceptance. In order to discuss the topic, Dove refers to the unconscious acceptance 'panels' that families held during their meal times. Some of the factors behavioral factors that influence the acceptance of food include: imitation (when a child imitates those choices of their parents), domination (punishment through taking or privileging food), urging (encouragement to eat food for health advantages), and resistance (refusing to partake in foods that are presented). Other areas of consideration for food acceptance included all physical attributes like odor, texture, and flavor; the volume of food presented; the quality of the soil the food was grown on; the manner in which food is stored, as well as the quality of that storage. From all of these, the agriculture of the time was formed./nDove states that the awareness of food acceptance is brought forth with the change to commercial farming where the best product comes from quantity. Home-grown foods were replaced with standardized products. The requirement for processed foods increased when the armies of WWII began to grow. Dove says that the missing link that has not been studied is food acceptability between the consumer and the food.  He also states that many specialized areas need to be studied in regard to food acceptability, including: grading of food quality, quality control, chemists to study treated foods and biologists to study relativity between food gathering and hunger./nThe ultimate conclusion of Dove's research was that attitudes related to food acceptance were due to habits of choosing food made from birth to adulthood, and other factors including climate and socioeconomics and religious characteristics of each region.[6]/nAnother research project Dove conducting involved the relationship between sterility and the copulatory organ in poultry in his article, \"Sex Sterility and the Diminutive Copulatory Organ in Domestic Fowl.\" Cloacas were examined in White Leghorns for a diminutive copulatory organ. Out of 78 individuals, 4 were discovered to be lacking this organ and 3 of the 4 were found to be sterile or have abnormal reproductive results. One of these four had perished and during the necropsy was found to have abnormally small testicles (one-fourth the normal size). The second cockerel was allowed the opportunity to reproduce with twelve female individuals for thirteen days and was unsuccessful in fertilizing any eggs. Of the remaining two, one fertilized a minute portion of an egg sample and the other fertilized practically all eggs of a sample of 24./nIt was determined that a type of sterility can be assumed by examination of the cloaca before placing a male into a mating pen. However, the inability to locate the gland does not always mean it is nonexistent \u2013 it could just be smaller in size.  In this experiment, there was no relation in regard to the size of the gland and the fertility of the cockerel. There were some exceptions in the experiment that Dove writes could have been due to late development of the gonads in comparison to the opposite sex\u2019s.[7]/nDove married Ruth Rebecca Stone (1908\u20131983) on 5 September 1933, in Montgomery, Alabama.

These have enabled him to address very general questions, such as the regulation of protein synthesis and the structure, functions and biogenesis of membrane proteins.[13] Fran\u00e7ois Jacob and Jacques Monod's work on the metabolism of another sugar, lactose, in the same bacterium led them to propose that the expression of genes encoding the enzymes necessary for the metabolism of this sugar is blocked by a repressor, a regulatory protein whose action is itself inhibited in the presence of lactose. The unblocking of the genes thus results from the inhibition of the repressor[14] [15]. This regulation involving a double inhibition was later to be qualified as negative. Based on his work on maltose metabolism, Maxime Schwartz was one of the first to suggest the existence of positive regulation, the expression of genes resulting from the activation of an activator[16]. Positive regulation mechanisms subsequently proved to be extremely frequent in all living cells. The most original aspect of Maxime Schwartz's work on membrane proteins is the demonstration that one of the proteins allowing the transport of maltose through the bacterial envelope serves as a receptor for a bacterial virus, the bacteriophage lambda.[17] It was a novel notion that virus receptors are proteins with a well-defined function for the target cell. This is now a well-established fact for many, many viruses. Maxime Schwartz has also been interested, in collaboration with the laboratory of the American Jonathan Beckwith, in the mechanisms that allow proteins to be placed in various layers of the bacterial envelope. Using genetic methods, he is helping to demonstrate that the signal sequence, located at the amino-terminal end of membrane-through proteins and defined by Gunther Blobel's group, is indeed necessary for the transport of these proteins across the cytoplasm membrane, but is not sufficient.[18][19] Indeed the inactivation by mutation of the signal sequence prevents such a protein from crossing the membrane; on the other hand the single addition of a signal sequence to the end of a cytoplasmic protein is not sufficient to make it cross the membrane./nManaging Director of the Institut Pasteur for two consecutive six-year terms, Maxime Schwartz is striving to continue the work of modernization begun by his predecessors, Jacques Monod, Fran\u00e7ois Gros and Raymond Dedonder. On the Paris campus, he presided over the construction of several new buildings, including the Scientific Information Centre, financed by the bequest from the Duchess of Windsor, and undertook the renovation of most of the laboratories located in older buildings. He also continued the development of the International Network of Pasteur Institutes (which he named), upgrading the equipment of the old institutes, integrating foreign institutes such as those in St. Petersburg and Romania, building a new institute in Cambodia, and initiating the creation of a joint laboratory between the Pasteur Institute and the University of Hong Kong. At the scientific level, it promotes the application of molecular biology techniques to the study of infectious diseases, thus allowing the emergence of several teams of great international reputation. In addition, he works to develop and modernize relations between research and industry, presiding in particular over the creation of the first \"start-ups\" created by researchers from the institute. In 1994, Maxime Schwartz succeeded in getting the American government to admit that the virus isolated by the American Robert Gallo as being the AIDS virus was none other than the virus that the Pasteurian Luc Montagnier had sent him a year earlier; he thus put an end to a 10-year-old controversy involving scientific ethics as well as financial aspects.[20]/nWith the title of Director of Laboratory Programming, Maxime Schwartz worked for 5 years as Scientific Director of the laboratories of the French Food Safety Agency (AFSSA).

As the Director of CBT he was instrumental in re-establishing it as the CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology- an institute where genomics and informatics have been seamlessly integrated. He assumed responsibility as the Director General[6] of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India on 12 November 2006./nHe has held the membership of the Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Council (2004\u20132011). He is currently on the advisory board of the X Prize in Genomics and the scientific advisory board of National Center of Biomedical Ontology (NCBO), Stanford University.[citation needed] He has also been serving as the adjunct professor, Bioinformatics Centre, University of Pune, since 2003 and holds the Joseph Austin McCartney & Ruth McCartney Hauck named Visiting Professorship, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, US, since 2012. He also holds honorary lifetime professorship to the University of Delhi. He is also the academy professor of AcSIR (Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research )./nBrahmachari\u2019s primary research involves elucidating the role of repetitive DNA in genome function in health and disease using a trans-disciplinary approach, integrating structural biology with genomics, molecular biology and information science.[7]/nHe has more than 12 patents, 23 copyrights and over 150 research publications to his credit.[citation needed]/nHis current focus is on leveraging the angle of personalised medicine towards pharmacogenomics with focus on affordable healthcare. He conceptualized and led the Indian Genome Variation Consortium Project to provide the first comprehensive genetic map of the extremely diverse Indian population and identify predictive markers for complex diseases and pharmacogenomics studies.[citation needed] He has also conceptualized the Ayurgenomics project that aims to integrate the principles of personalized medicine from Ayurveda, an ancient Indian medical system with modern genomics to bridge the gap from genotype to phenotype. Brahmachari is the Chief Mentor of CSIR-Open Source Drug Discovery (OSDD) project, a CSIR-led Team India Consortium with global partnership. Emerging as India\u2019s first crowd sourcing initiative, OSDD is today a global translational research platform with more than 7500 participants from 130 countries.[citation needed]. Brahmachari is the Chairman of Scientific Advisory Board of Genotypic, India's first Genomics company./nBrahmachari has been the member of the HUGO Council (2004-2011).[citation needed] He also co-chaired the 13th Human Genome Organization meet with Edison Liu, HUGO president. The meet was held at Hyderabad International Convention Centre, Hyderabad, India.[8][9]/nHe was conferred the Banga Bibhushan Title, the highest state civilian award by the Government of West Bengal in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the field of Life Sciences in 2013.[10]/nHe has been selected as one of the Fierce's Top 10 Biotech Techies for his outstanding contribution to the field of genomics and open source drug discovery.[11] Science has hailed him as \"Open-source guru\" (2012) considering his exceptional contribution in conceptualizing and mentoring India\u2019s first crowd sourcing initiative \u2013 Open Source Drug Discovery.[12]/nBrahmachari received the Life Time Achievement award in Genomics (2018) at the Genomics India Conference, Bengaluru./nBrahmachari has been involved in a lot of controversies. The first involved allegations of behind the scenes lobbying to ensure an extension of his position as the CSIR Director.[13] Another controversy involved allegations that he fostered cronyism at the expense of meritocracy at CSIR. Shiva Ayyadurai, an expatriate scientist reported that \"Our interaction with CSIR scientists revealed that they work in a medieval, feudal environment.\".[14]/nHis claims regarding the first mapping of the Mycobaterium tuberculosis bacterial genome and the identification of a potential anti-tuberculosis drug candidate from the OSDD project invited severe criticism for being inaccurate and misguiding. The Nature article had been corrected multiple times, in an unprecedented fashion due to factual inaccuracies in the reporting by the correspondent [15]", "27015334": "Didier Raoult (French pronunciation: [didje \u0281a.ul(t)]; born 13 March 1952)[1] is a retired[2] French physician and microbiologist specialising in infectious diseases. He taught about infectious diseases at the Faculty of Medicine of Aix-Marseille University (AMU), and in 1984, created the Rickettsia Unit of the university. From 2008 to 2022, Raoult was the director of the Unit\u00e9 de Recherche sur les Maladies Infectieuses et Tropicales Emergentes. He gained significant worldwide attention during the COVID-19 pandemic for vocally promoting hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for the disease, despite the lack of evidence for its effectiveness and the subsequent opposition from NIH and WHO to its use for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients.[3][4]/nAs of 2023, 56 of Raoult's research publications have received an expression of concern from their publishers arising from questions related to ethics approval information, and three other research papers have been retracted.[5][6]/nRaoult was born on 13 March 1952 in Dakar, French West Africa (present-day Senegal). Raoult's father, who came from Brittany, was serving there as a military doctor;[7] his mother, originally from Marseille, was a nurse. His family returned to France in 1961, and settled in Marseille.[8] \nHe was for a time schooled in Nice, then attended a boarding school in Brian\u00e7on.[9]/nA poor student,[7][10] Raoult repeated a year at high school, then dropped out in the second year of high school to board a French merchant ship called Renaissance and spent the next two years at sea.[10][11][12]/nIn 1972, he sat his baccalaur\u00e9at in literature as an independent candidate, and registered at the medical school in Marseille.[13] Believing in a family tradition in medicine, Raoult senior refused to pay for his studies in any other subject.[7] Raoult had wanted to become an obstetrician after qualifying, but his grade in the resident's examination was too low for that choice. He specialised instead in infectious diseases, in the footsteps of his great-grandfather Paul Legendre (1854\u20131936).[14][15][16]/nIn 1982, Raoult married psychiatrist and novelist Natacha Ca\u00efn (born 1960).[17] They have two children,[18] and Raoult has an estranged daughter from a previous marriage, angiologist Magali Carcopino-Tusoli.[19]/nFrom 2008 to 2022, Raoult was the director of the Unit\u00e9 de Recherche sur les Maladies Infectieuses et Tropicales Emergentes, (URMITE; in English, Infectious and Tropical Emergent Diseases Research Unit), which employs more than 200 people.[20] He retired in the summer of 2022,[21] after being allowed to stay on for at most one year after retiring from his professor position on August 31, 2021.[22][23]/nRaoult was awarded the Grand prix de l'Inserm in 2010 [24] and in 2015 shared the \u20ac450,000 prize of the Grand Prix scientifique de la Fondation Louis D. of the Institut de France with biologist Chris Bowler from the Institut de Biologie de l'Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris.[25] The bacteria genus Raoultella was named in his honor[26] by his right-hand man and longest-serving collaborator, Michel Drancourt.[27]/nRaoult initiated the construction of a new building to host the Institut hospitalo-universitaire (IHU) M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection.[28] The IHU Mediterran\u00e9e Infection, which opened in early 2017,[29] is dedicated to the management and study of infectious diseases and combines diagnostic, care, research and teaching activities in one location.[30]/nIn May 2022 the French drug safety agency ANSM announced it would file charges against the IHU for potentially criminal research misconduct during the COVID-19 pandemic.[31]/nIn June 2022, ANSM implemented \"a series of particularly severe sanctions\" against the Raoult-led IHU.[32]/nIn September 2022 it was reported that Raoult's laboratory was being investigated by the Aix-Marseille University for \u201cserious malfunctions,\u201d that in response to this \"scientific misconduct investigation by the University of Aix Marseille\" four papers from Raoult's group appearing in journals published by the American Society for Microbiology had received expressions of concern, and that a criminal investigation had been initiated.[33]/nRaoult has more than 2,300 indexed publications.[34] As of 2008, he was \"classified among the ten leading French researchers by the journal Nature, for the number of his publications (more than two thousand) and for his citation number\".[35] According to ISI Web of Knowledge, he was the most cited microbiologist in Europe in 2014, and the seventh worldwide.[36][37] According to the Thomson Reuters source \"Highly Cited Researchers List\", Raoult is among the most influential researchers in his field and his publications are among the 1% most consulted in academic journals. He is one of the 99 most cited microbiologists in the world and one of the 73 most highly cited French scientists.[38] He is a world reference for Q fever and Whipple's disease.[39] As of January 2022, he had over 194,000 citations and an h-index of 197.[40] He is also on the list of the 400 most cited authors in the biomedical world.[41] Raoult is also one of the 7.3% most self-cited authors, more than 25% of his citations coming from papers he co-authored.[42]/nYet, Raoult's extremely uncommon and high publication rate results from his \"attaching his name to nearly every paper that comes out of his institute\",[43] a practice that has been called \"grossly unethical\" by Steven Salzberg.[44] Since 2013 he has been one of the overseas scientists co-affiliated with the King Abdulaziz University of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia,[45][46] known to \"offer highly cited researchers lucrative adjunct professorships, with minimal requirements for them to be physically present, in return for being listed by them as a secondary affiliation\", and so increase its own institutional citation index.[47]/nOf the 1,836 articles published by Raoult between 1995 and 2020 (amounting to over 120 a year, or approximately one article every three days), 230 were published in two journals edited by Michel Drancourt, who was his right-hand man at the IHU and a close collaborator for over 35 years. Staff members have editorial positions at almost half the journals that have published Raoult's work. The funding of French health institutes according to their number of publications has been suggested to be at the root of his large number of publications.[48]/nIn 2006, Raoult and four co-authors were banned for one year from publishing in the journals of the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), after a reviewer for Infection and Immunity discovered that four figures from the revised manuscript of a paper about a mouse model for typhus were identical to figures from the originally submitted manuscript, even though they were supposed to represent a different experiment.[49] In response, Raoult \"resigned from the editorial board of two other ASM journals, canceled his membership in the American Academy of Microbiology, ASM's honorific leadership group, and banned his lab from submitting to ASM journals\".[49] In response to Science covering the story in 2012, he stated that, \"I did not manage the paper and did not even check the last version\".[50] The paper was subsequently published in a different journal.[51]/nOn 17 March 2020, Raoult announced in an online video that a trial involving 24 patients from southeast France supported the claim that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were effective in treating for COVID-19.[52] On 20 March, he published a preliminary report of his study online in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents.[53]\u00a0 The French Health Minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, was reported as announcing that \"new tests will now go ahead in order to evaluate the results by Professor Raoult, in an attempt to independently replicate the trials and ensure the findings are scientifically robust enough, before any possible decision might be made to roll any treatment out to the wider public\".[54] V\u00e9ran refused to endorse the study conducted by Raoult and the possible health ramifications,  on the basis of a single study conducted on 24 people.[55]/nThe French media also reported that the French pharmaceutical company Sanofi had offered French authorities millions of doses of the drug for use against COVID-19.[54] On 3 April, the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, which publishes the journal, issued a statement that the report on the non-blind, non-randomized study \"does not meet the Society's expected standard, especially relating to the lack of better explanations of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety.\"[56]/nRaoult was one of 11 prominent scientists named on 11 March to a committee to advise on scientific matters pertaining to the epidemic in France.[57] He did not attend any of the meetings and resigned from the committee on 24 March saying that he refused to participate.[58] He denounced the \"absence of anything scientifically sound\", and criticised its members for \"not having a clue\".[59][60] He defended chloroquine as a benchmark drug for lung diseases, saying that it had suddenly been declared dangerous after having been safely used for 80 years.[59] Following reports and a complaint filed in July by the French-speaking Society of Infectious Pathology (Spilf), the departmental council of the French Order of Physicians opened a formal case against Didier Raoult.[61]/nOn May 5, 2021, Elisabeth Bik (who specializes in identifying manipulated images in scientific papers) raised concerns about dozens of Raoult's papers\u2014including ethical, procedural, and methodological problems in a March 2020 paper reporting success in a small hydroxychloroquine trial. Raoult's lawyer subsequently announced that Raoult was accusing and suing the scientific integrity consultant of harassment and blackmail. The French non-profit association Citizen4Science, formed by scientists and citizens, published a press release and a petition that day, denouncing the harassment of scientists and defenders of science integrity,[62] specifically defending Bik and calling on French authorities to intervene and for journalists to look into the matter. Several French newspapers immediately reported Citizen4Science's initiative.[63][64][65][66] The petition was signed by thousands of scientists and others throughout the world. By May 22, 2021 Raoult had begun legal proceedings against Bik.[67] There followed various articles in international mainstream media supporting Bik,[68] and an article in Science updated on June 4, 2021 in issue 6546, reporting over 3,000 signatures for the Citizen4Science petition.[69]/nOn May 18, 2021, Lonni Besan\u00e7on, a French postdoctoral research fellow at Monash University, wrote an open letter supporting Elisabeth Bik.[70] The letter  was co-signed by more than 2200 scientists and 30 scholarly societies.[71]/nOn June 1, 2021, CNRS published a press release[72] denouncing the \"judiciarization of controversy and scientific debates\", condemning Raoult's legal proceedings against Elisabeth Bik. On June 10, 2021 French Senator Bernard Jomier carried the Citizen4Science press release and petition to the French Senate through a written question to  French Minister of Health Olivier V\u00e9ran, requiring action to protect bearers of science integrity.[73]/nIn December 2022, publisher PLOS marked 48 articles by Raoult with expressions of concern \"about the reported research ethics approval information and the article\u2019s adherence to PLOS research ethics policies\".[74]/nIn 2022, five papers received an expression of concern from publishers, warning that they may contain errors or be otherwise untrustworthy.[75]\nIn 2020, another paper was retracted after image manipulations were unmasked.[75]/nIn October 2021, the Mediapart online investigative journal brought to light illegal clinical trials of a treatment against tuberculosis, which Raoult and IHU  had been conducting since 2017. The trial was started without seeking the mandatory approval of the French clinical trial regulator, and continued despite its strenuous objections to its protocol when they eventually sought permission. Many of the patients in the trial were minors, homeless, or illegal residents, and therefore could not legally consent to a trial. \nSeveral suffered severe side effects such as kidney failure from the known toxicity of one of the four antibiotics combined in the trial, and at least one patient contaminated several family members because the treatment was simultaneously ineffective and poorly monitored by IHU.[76][77] A subsequent investigation by the French drug safety agency (ANSM) identified grave ethics and safety breaches in IHU clinical trials. Its report was forwarded to the Marseille prosecutor for potential criminal prosecution, and ANSM additionally threatened to suspend all on-going clinical trials at IHU.[78] The prosecutor opened a formal inquiry for falsification and forgery of documentation and for unjustified medical procedures.[79]", "61716654": "Velia M.

A year later, she finished a graduate program from the same department (BS 120e),[1] emphasising insects and other land arthropods. She investigated their abundance and distribution on the south side and top of Mt. Esja.[2] She pursued studies in ecology at University College of North Wales, Bangor, (1975-1976) and completed a master's there.[1] The research project was on competition for food between closely related freshwater flatworms. She worked under the  supervision of Prof. T. Reynoldson.[2] Hrefna started a doctoral programme in 1977 in the Zoology Department of the University of Liverpool in England and completed it in 1980. Her supervisor there was Professor G.A. Parker who was a pioneer in evolutionary studies emphasising reproductive behaviour and evolution of differences between the sexes and had worked a great deal on the yellow dung fly. Hrefna's doctoral project was in this field, where the emphasis is to interpret animals' behaviour, in the light of ecology and evolution (behaviour ecology/sociobiology). The title of the dissertation is Evolutionary Aaspects of Sexual Dimorphism in Size: Studies on Dung Flies and Three Groups of Birds.[3][4] She was the first woman in Iceland to complete a doctorate in animal ethology. After returning home, she completed teacher certification at the University of Iceland (1982).[1]/nDuring her years of study, she worked one summer at the Icelandic Fisheries Laboratories (1971). In 1973 and 1974 she assisted Prof. Arn\u00fe\u00f3r Gar\u00f0arson (UI) with research on the vegetation in the \u00dej\u00f3rs\u00e1 River Wetlands. In the summers of 1975 and 1977, she worked for Prof. Agnar Ing\u00f3lfsson (UI)  doing research on the distribution of coastal invertebrates in Iceland. She assisted with practical teaching in ecology and zoology with her studies in winter 1974\u20131975. After finishing her doctoral programme, she taught part-time at the Biology Department of the University of Iceland and Hamrahl\u00ed\u00f0 Junior College (two years). In the fall of 1982, she was hired as assistant professor in biology at Iceland University of Education (KHI) and was promoted to associate professor in 1987 and then to professor in 1999. With the merger of Iceland University of Education and the University of Iceland in 2008, she became professor at UI's School of Education. Her students at the School of Education have been pre-service teachers selecting biology/natural science as their major and in-service teachers who have been doing continuing education courses in biology, environmental education and outdoor education. At the University of Iceland, she was the principal teacher in ethology (animal behaviour) first in spring 1981 and then, usually, every other year \u2013 last in 2018. She has supervised students[5] (Icelandic and French) in master's studies in ethology, in addition to many teacher education students in their final projects for B.Ed. and M.Ed. degrees. She has also taught a course on the ethology of horses at H\u00f3lar University College, Iceland (2011-2013).[1]/nHrefna's research in biology has focused on ethology (behavioural ecology).[6] For example, she has worked on the reproductive behaviour of dung flies and arctic char. Since 1996, she has worked with many experts and students on the (social) behaviour of the Icelandic horse,[2][7][8][9] focusing on dominance orders, what determines an individual horse's positioning, and friendship patterns, how their behaviour (aggression, mutual grooming) is affected by group composition in pastures, their behaviour and time budget in the wintertime and with French colleagues on the natural weaning of foals.[10] Her research has received support from the Icelandic Centre for Research, UI's Research Fund[11] and other parties. In addition, the research has been presented at many conferences and meetings in many parts of the world and published in peer reviewed journals.[2]/nHrefna has participated in studies in natural science education, given talks,[12] written articles and chapters in books on educational theory on biology and environmental education,[13][14] written course materials for elementary schools in zoology and made a film on the reproductive behaviour of arctic char in Lake Thingvallavatn, along with Karl Gunnarsson.[15][2]  She belonged to a workgroup of the National Centre for Educational Materials and was for a long time a counsellor at the centre regarding translations and the selection of course materials in biology./nHrefna has been trusted to serve in various committees where full confidence is needed at the University of Iceland and outside it.[1] She was the first woman member of the Student Council's Board of Directors 1973\u20131974.[16] At KHI, for example, she was a department chair, a member of the School Council, semester manager, member of the Continuing Education's Faculty Council, and chair of the selection committee. After merger of the Universities, she was a member of the Faculty Council of the Faculty of Teachers.[1] She was the chair of the Electives Division and is now the School of Education's representative on UI's Promotion Committee.[17] She was on the selection committee of the Agricultural University of Iceland in Hvanneyri and was appointed to the selection committee for the Knowledge Centre in the Faroe Islands.

He chose instead to devote his life to science and academia.  As a working-class boy growing up in England in the 1930s, and during World War II, it was a great achievement for him to win a scholarship to be educated at the prestigious and ancient Leeds Grammar School. He then went on to study at the University of Edinburgh from which he graduated with a BSc, MB ChB, and gained an MD in hospital infection.[2]/nHe worked briefly (from 1959\u20131960) as a house physician in Edinburgh City Hospital before becoming a lecturer in bacteriology at University of Edinburgh Medical School (1961\u20131966). In 1967 he became one of the youngest-ever visiting professors for the World Health Organization (WHO) at Baroda University in India, as well as a WHO SE Asia medical consultant. He toured India extensively, visiting not only towns and cities but also many remote rural areas as part of his WHO project to greatly improve the standards of health and hygiene at various hospitals. He returned from India to become first Reader, then Consultant and finally Professor of Medical Microbiology at Westminster Medical School, University of London./nWhilst continuing as Professor at Westminster Medical School he also simultaneously became Professor of Medical Microbiology at Charing Cross Hospital Medical School (and was one of the founders of the then new hospital), thus running two separate departments (each with its own research and teaching teams) in two different teaching hospitals./nDuring the 1970s and 1980s he played a significant role as a pioneer in the field of bone marrow transplantation.[3] In particular he was closely involved with the treatment of two ground-breaking cases; those of Simon Bostic and  Anthony Nolan.[4] Anthony Nolan's mother went on to found the charitable Anthony Nolan Trust.[5]/nResearch in the fields of bacteriology and medical microbiology were not his only professional interests. Despite his demanding research activities he also developed world-class expertise in the history and development of medicine, from the dawn of civilisation to the then present day, and also became a distinguished and popular lecturer in that subject./nHe was honorary archivist of the Royal College of Pathology of which he was also a Fellow (FRCPath), President of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of Medicine and Pharmacy[6] president of the Medical Sciences Historical Society[7] and a Liveryman of the Society of Apothecaries[8] Worshipful where he was also Director of the DHMSA[9] (the Diploma of the History of Medicine at the Society of Apothecaries), an important and popular course and diploma, to which some students even flew in from across Europe (and one from Canada) each week to attend!

For example, as an authority on the history of medicine he was approached by the Bank of England to suggest a medical theme for the \u00a310 note. He not only suggested Florence Nightingale as a subject but went on to recommend they base their design on a \"classic\" scene of her carrying her famous lamp, which had earned her the nickname \"The Lady with the Lamp,\" around a ward of the Military Hospital at Scutari during the Crimean War. When the Bank of England was unable to track down the particular steel engraving he had recommended he lent them a copy of the rare print from his collection./nThe Florence Nightingale \u00a310 banknote[14] was first issued in February 1975 and proved extremely popular (leading for a while to the \u00a310 note being nicknamed \"a Flo\" by some, as in \"excuse me \u2013 have you got change for a Flo\"). It was not withdrawn until May 1994./nFollowing several brief but popular broadcasts he gave on the dangers of licking postage stamps (particularly in countries that used crude forms of \"cow gum\" made from bones that could contain a worrying variety of still active diseases) he was consulted by De La Rue[15] and the Walsall Security Printing companies who were early pioneers of self-adhesive stamps. One of the resulting projects he became involved with was the development of a set of self adhesive stamps featuring historic post boxes[16] for Gibraltar./nHe appeared a number of times as \"a medical expert\" on television. For example, in the 1970s he was interviewed by Frank Bough on the BBC's then popular \"Nationwide\" programme shown on prime family-time TV.  Selwyn introduced himself on the programme as a microbiologist and bacteriologist with an interest in dermatological matters such as the flora and fauna of our skin. He went on to explain that through his researches he had come to realise most of us were using far too many chemical-based cosmetics and, as a result, disrupting the ecology of our skin. This resulted, he said, in building-up a dependence on more of these otherwise unnecessary cosmetics. He suggested that clean water and small amounts of simple soap were ample and that most of the available cosmetics and personal hygiene products being advertised were not just unnecessary but also potentially harmful especially through habitual over use./nHe worked with the BBC on a number of projects which included, for example, \"Horizon\" documentaries and \"Microbes and Men\" (1974)./nWhilst barely in his 50s Professor Selwyn was diagnosed as suffering from \"multiple system atrophy\" (MSA), and told he might have only around 5\u20139 years left to live.

He is remembered, at least in malacology, as a taxonomist of considerable stature./nThe modern era generally remembers Lamarck for a theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics, called Lamarckism (inaccurately named after him), soft inheritance, or use/disuse theory,[8] which he described in his 1809 Philosophie zoologique. However, the idea of soft inheritance long antedates him, formed only a small element of his theory of evolution, and was in his time accepted by many natural historians. Lamarck's contribution to evolutionary theory consisted of the first truly cohesive theory of biological evolution,[9] in which an alchemical complexifying force drove organisms up a ladder of complexity, and a second environmental force adapted them to local environments through use and disuse of characteristics, differentiating them from other organisms.[10] Scientists have debated whether advances in the field of transgenerational epigenetics mean that Lamarck was to an extent correct, or not.[11]/nJean-Baptiste Lamarck was born in Bazentin, Picardy, northern France,[5] as the 11th child in an impoverished aristocratic family.[Note 2] Male members of the Lamarck family had traditionally served in the French army. Lamarck's eldest brother was killed in combat at the Siege of Bergen op Zoom, and two other brothers were still in service when Lamarck was in his teenaged years. Yielding to the wishes of his father, Lamarck enrolled in a Jesuit college in Amiens in the late 1750s.[5]/nAfter his father died in 1760, Lamarck bought himself a horse, and rode across the country to join the French army, which was in Germany at the time. Lamarck showed great physical courage on the battlefield in the Seven Years' War with Prussia, and he was even nominated for the lieutenancy.[5] Lamarck's company was left exposed to the direct artillery fire of their enemies, and was quickly reduced to just 14 men\u2014with no officers. One of the men suggested that the puny, 17-year-old volunteer should assume command and order a withdrawal from the field; although Lamarck accepted command, he insisted they remain where they had been posted until relieved./nWhen their colonel reached the remains of their company, this display of courage and loyalty impressed him so much that Lamarck was promoted to officer on the spot. However, when one of his comrades playfully lifted him by the head, he sustained an inflammation in the lymphatic glands of the neck, and he was sent to Paris to receive treatment.[5] He was awarded a commission and settled at his post in Monaco. There, he encountered Trait\u00e9 des plantes usuelles, a botany book by James Francis Chomel.[5]/nWith a reduced pension of only 400 francs a year, Lamarck resolved to pursue a profession. He attempted to study medicine, and supported himself by working in a bank office.[5] Lamarck studied medicine for four years, but gave it up under his elder brother's persuasion. He was interested in botany, especially after his visits to the Jardin du Roi, and he became a student under Bernard de Jussieu, a notable French naturalist.[5] Under Jussieu, Lamarck spent 10 years studying French flora. In 1776, he wrote his first scientific essay\u2014a chemical treatise.[12]/nAfter his studies, in 1778, he published some of his observations and results in a three-volume work, entitled Flore fran\u00e7aise. Lamarck's work was respected by many scholars, and it launched him into prominence in French science. On 8 August 1778, Lamarck married Marie Anne Rosalie Delaporte.[13] Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, one of the top French scientists of the day, mentored Lamarck, and helped him gain membership to the French Academy of Sciences in 1779 and a commission as a royal botanist in 1781, in which he traveled to foreign botanical gardens and museums.[14] Lamarck's first son, Andr\u00e9, was born on 22 April 1781, and he made his colleague Andr\u00e9 Thouin the child's godfather./nIn his two years of travel, Lamarck collected rare plants that were not available in the Royal Garden, and also other objects of natural history, such as minerals and ores, that were not found in French museums. On 7 January 1786, his second son, Antoine, was born, and Lamarck chose Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, Bernard de Jussieu's nephew, as the boy's godfather.[15] On 21 April the following year, Charles Ren\u00e9, Lamarck's third son, was born. Ren\u00e9 Louiche Desfontaines, a professor of botany at the Royal Garden, was the boy's godfather, and Lamarck's elder sister, Marie Charlotte Pelagie De Monet, was the godmother.[15] In 1788, Buffon's successor at the position of Intendant of the Royal Garden, Charles-Claude Flahaut de la Billaderie, comte d'Angiviller, created a position for Lamarck, with a yearly salary of 1,000 francs, as the keeper of the herbarium of the Royal Garden.[5]/nIn 1790, at the height of the French Revolution, Lamarck changed the name of the Royal Garden from Jardin du Roi to Jardin des Plantes, a name that did not imply such a close association with King Louis XVI.[16] Lamarck had worked as the keeper of the herbarium for five years before he was appointed curator and professor of invertebrate zoology at the Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle in 1793.[5] During his time at the herbarium, Lamarck's wife gave birth to three more children before dying on 27 September 1792. With the official title of \"Professeur d'Histoire naturelle des Insectes et des Vers\", Lamarck received a salary of nearly 2,500 francs per year.[17] The following year, on 9 October, he married Charlotte Reverdy, who was 30 years his junior.[15] On 26 September 1794 Lamarck was appointed to serve as secretary of the assembly of professors for the museum for a period of one year. In 1797, Charlotte died, and he married Julie Mallet the following year; she died in 1819.[15]/nIn his first six years as professor, Lamarck published only one paper, in 1798, on the influence of the moon on the Earth's atmosphere.[5] Lamarck began as an essentialist who believed species were unchanging; however, after working on the molluscs of the Paris Basin, he grew convinced that transmutation or change in the nature of a species occurred over time.[5] He set out to develop an explanation, and on 11 May 1800 (the 21st day of Floreal, Year VIII, in the revolutionary timescale used in France at the time), he presented a lecture at the Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle in which he first outlined his newly developing ideas about evolution./nIn 1801, he published Syst\u00e8me des Animaux sans Vert\u00e8bres, a major work on the classification of invertebrates. In the work, he introduced definitions of natural groups among invertebrates. He categorized echinoderms, arachnids, crustaceans, and annelids, which he separated from the old taxon for worms known as Vermes.[16] Lamarck was the first to separate arachnids from insects in classification, and he moved crustaceans into a separate class from insects./nIn 1802 Lamarck published Hydrog\u00e9ologie, and became one of the first to use the term biology in its modern sense.[7][18] In Hydrog\u00e9ologie, Lamarck advocated a steady-state geology based on a strict uniformitarianism. He argued that global currents tended to flow from east to west, and continents eroded on their eastern borders, with the material carried across to be deposited on the western borders. Thus, the Earth's continents marched steadily westward around the globe./nThat year, he also published Recherches sur l'Organisation des Corps Vivants, in which he drew out his theory on evolution. He believed that all life was organized in a vertical chain, with gradation between the lowest forms and the highest forms of life, thus demonstrating a path to progressive developments in nature.[19]/nIn his own work, Lamarck had favored the then-more traditional theory based on the classical four elements. During Lamarck's lifetime, he became controversial, attacking the more enlightened chemistry proposed by Lavoisier. He also came into conflict with the widely respected palaeontologist Georges Cuvier, who was not a supporter of evolution.[20] According to Peter J. Bowler, Cuvier \"ridiculed Lamarck's theory of transformation and defended the fixity of species.\"[21] According to Martin J. S. Rudwick:/nCuvier was clearly hostile to the materialistic overtones of current transformist theorizing, but it does not necessarily follow that he regarded species origin as supernatural; certainly he was careful to use neutral language to refer to the causes of the origins of new forms of life, and even of man.[22]/nLamarck gradually turned blind; he died in Paris on 18 December 1829. When he died, his family was so poor, they had to apply to the Academie for financial assistance. Lamarck was buried in a common grave of the Montparnasse cemetery for just five years, according to the grant obtained from relatives. Later, the body was dug up along with other remains and was lost. Lamarck's books and the contents of his home were sold at auction, and his body was buried in a temporary lime pit.[23]\nAfter his death, Cuvier used the form of a eulogy to denigrate Lamarck:/n[Cuvier's] \u00e9loge of Lamarck is one of the most deprecatory and chillingly partisan biographies I have ever read\u2014though he was supposedly writing respectful comments in the old tradition of de mortuis nil nisi bonum./nWhile he was working on Hydrog\u00e9ologie (1802), Lamarck had the idea to apply the principle of erosion to biology. This led him to the basic principle of evolution, which saw the fluids in organs inheriting more complex forms and functions, thus passing on these traits to the organism's descendants.[12] This was a reversal from Lamarck's previous view, published in his Memoirs of Physics and Natural History (1797), in which he briefly refers to the immutability of species.[25]/nLamarck stressed two main themes in his biological work (neither of them to do with soft inheritance). The first was that the environment gives rise to changes in animals. He cited examples of blindness in moles, the presence of teeth in mammals and the absence of teeth in birds as evidence of this principle. The second principle was that life was structured in an orderly manner and that many different parts of all bodies make possible the organic movements of animals.[19]/nAlthough he was not the first thinker to advocate organic evolution, he was the first to develop a truly coherent evolutionary theory.[10] He outlined his theories regarding evolution first in his Floreal lecture of 1800, and then in three later published works:/nLamarck employed several mechanisms as drivers of evolution, drawn from the common knowledge of his day and from his own belief in the chemistry before Lavoisier. He used these mechanisms to explain the two forces he saw as constituting evolution: force driving animals from simple to complex forms and a force adapting animals to their local environments and differentiating them from each other. He believed that these forces must be explained as a necessary consequence of basic physical principles, favoring a materialistic attitude toward biology./nLamarck referred to a tendency for organisms to become more complex, moving \"up\" a ladder of progress. He referred to this phenomenon as Le pouvoir de la vie or la force qui tend sans cesse \u00e0 composer l'organisation (The force that perpetually tends to make order). Lamarck believed in the ongoing spontaneous generation of simple living organisms through action on physical matter by a material life force.[27][26]/nLamarck ran against the modern chemistry promoted by Lavoisier (whose ideas he regarded with disdain), preferring to embrace a more traditional alchemical view of the elements as influenced primarily by earth, air, fire, and water. He asserted that once living organisms form, the movements of fluids in living organisms naturally drove them to evolve toward ever greater levels of complexity:[27]/nThe rapid motion of fluids will etch canals between delicate tissues. Soon their flow will begin to vary, leading to the emergence of distinct organs. The fluids themselves, now more elaborate, will become more complex, engendering a greater variety of secretions and substances composing the organs./nHe argued that organisms thus moved from simple to complex in a steady, predictable way based on the fundamental physical principles of alchemy. In this view, simple organisms never disappeared because they were constantly being created by spontaneous generation in what has been described as a \"steady-state biology\". Lamarck saw spontaneous generation as being ongoing, with the simple organisms thus created being transmuted over time becoming more complex. He is sometimes regarded as believing in a teleological (goal-oriented) process where organisms became more perfect as they evolved, though as a materialist, he emphasized that these forces must originate necessarily from underlying physical principles. According to the paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn, \"Lamarck denied, absolutely, the existence of any 'perfecting tendency' in nature, and regarded evolution as the final necessary effect of surrounding conditions on life.\"[28] Charles Coulston Gillispie, a historian of science, has written \"life is a purely physical phenomenon in Lamarck\", and argued that Lamarck's views should not be confused with the vitalist school of thought.[29]/nThe second component of Lamarck's theory of evolution was the adaptation of organisms to their environment. This could move organisms upward from the ladder of progress into new and distinct forms with local adaptations. It could also drive organisms into evolutionary blind alleys, where the organism became so finely adapted that no further change could occur. Lamarck argued that this adaptive force was powered by the interaction of organisms with their environment, by the use and disuse of certain characteristics./nThe last clause of this law introduces what is now called soft inheritance, the inheritance of acquired characteristics, or simply \"Lamarckism\", though it forms only a part of Lamarck's thinking.[31] However, in the field of epigenetics, evidence is growing that soft inheritance plays a part in the changing of some organisms' phenotypes; it leaves the genetic material (DNA) unaltered (thus not violating the central dogma of biology) but prevents the expression of genes,[32] such as by methylation to modify DNA transcription; this can be produced by changes in behaviour and environment. Many epigenetic changes are heritable to a degree. Thus, while DNA itself is not directly altered by the environment and behavior except through selection, the relationship of the genotype to the phenotype can be altered, even across generations, by experience within the lifetime of an individual. This has led to calls for biology to reconsider Lamarckian processes in evolution in light of modern advances in molecular biology.[33]/nIn his book Philosophie zoologique, Lamarck referred to God as the \"sublime author of nature\". Lamarck's religious views are examined in the book Lamarck, the Founder of Evolution (1901) by Alpheus Packard. According to Packard from Lamarck's writings, he may be regarded as a deist.[34]/nThe philosopher of biology Michael Ruse described Lamarck, \"as believing in God as an unmoved mover, creator of the world and its laws, who refuses to intervene miraculously in his creation.\"[35] Biographer James Moore described Lamarck as a \"thoroughgoing deist\".[36]/nThe historian Jacques Roger has written, \"Lamarck was a materialist to the extent that he did not consider it necessary to have recourse to any spiritual principle... his deism remained vague, and his idea of creation did not prevent him from believing everything in nature, including the highest forms of life, was but the result of natural processes.\"[37]/nLamarck is known largely for his views on evolution, which have been dismissed in favour of developments in Darwinism. His theory of evolution only achieved fame after the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859), which spurred critics of Darwin's new theory to fall back on Lamarckian evolution as a more well-established alternative.[38]/nLamarck is usually remembered for his belief in the then commonly held theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics, and the use and disuse model by which organisms developed their characteristics. Lamarck incorporated this belief into his theory of evolution, along with other common beliefs of the time, such as spontaneous generation.[26] The inheritance of acquired characteristics (also called the theory of adaptation or soft inheritance) was rejected by August Weismann in the 1880s[Note 3] when he developed a theory of inheritance in which germ plasm (the sex cells, later redefined as DNA), remained separate and distinct from the soma (the rest of the body); thus, nothing which happens to the soma may be passed on with the germ plasm. This model allegedly underlies the modern understanding of inheritance./nLamarck constructed one of the first theoretical frameworks of organic evolution. While this theory was generally rejected during his lifetime,[39] Stephen Jay Gould argues that Lamarck was the \"primary evolutionary theorist\", in that his ideas, and the way in which he structured his theory, set the tone for much of the subsequent thinking in evolutionary biology, through to the present day.[40] Developments in epigenetics, the study of cellular and physiological traits that are heritable by daughter cells and not caused by changes in the DNA sequence, have caused debate about whether a \"neolamarckist\" view of inheritance could be correct: Lamarck was not in a position to give a molecular explanation for his theory. Eva Jablonka and Marion Lamb, for example, call themselves neolamarckists.[11][33] Reviewing the evidence, David Haig argued that any such mechanisms must themselves have evolved through natural selection.[11]/nDarwin allowed a role for use and disuse as an evolutionary mechanism subsidiary to natural selection, most often in respect of disuse.[Note 4] He praised Lamarck for \"the eminent service of arousing attention to the probability of all change in the organic... world, being the result of law, not miraculous interposition\".[42] Lamarckism is also occasionally used to describe quasi-evolutionary concepts in societal contexts, though not by Lamarck himself. For example, the memetic theory of cultural evolution is sometimes described as a form of Lamarckian inheritance of nongenetic traits./nDuring his lifetime, Lamarck named a large number of species, many of which have become synonyms. The World Register of Marine Species gives no fewer than 1,634 records.[43] The Indo-Pacific Molluscan Database gives 1,781 records.[44] Among these are some well-known families such as the ark clams (Arcidae), the sea hares (Aplysiidae), and the cockles (Cardiidae). The International Plant Names Index gives 58 records, including a number of well-known genera such as the mosquito fern (Azolla).[citation needed]/nThe honeybee subspecies Apis mellifera lamarckii is named after Lamarck, as well as the bluefire jellyfish (Cyaneia lamarckii). A number of plants have also been named after him, including Amelanchier lamarckii (juneberry), Digitalis lamarckii, and Aconitum lamarckii, as well as the grass genus Lamarckia./nThe International Plant Names Index gives 116 records of plant species named after Lamarck.[45]/nAmong the marine species, no fewer than 103 species or genera carry the epithet \"lamarcki\", \"lamarckii\" or \"lamarckiana\", but many have since become synonyms.

Fuchs is an American cell biologist famous for her work on the biology and molecular mechanisms of mammalian skin and skin diseases, who helped lead the modernization of dermatology. Fuchs pioneered reverse genetics approaches, which assess protein function first and then assess its role in development and disease. In particular, Fuchs researches skin stem cells and their production of hair and skin. She is an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Rebecca C. Lancefield Professor of Mammalian Cell Biology and Development at The Rockefeller University./nFuchs grew up outside Chicago, in a family of scientists\u2014her father, aunt, and sister were also scientists, and her family encouraged her to pursue higher education.[1] She said those influences were especially important to her as a child. During an interview with Faiza Elmasry in 2010, Fuchs said, \"I think like many of the children in our world, I got interested in science just from having a butterfly net and from having a few strainers and some boots and going down to the streams and creeks and being out in the fields.\"[2] Even her mother, who was a homemaker, inspired her to pursue her interest in science at a time when not many women went into scientific fields. \"She was a housewife but she took pride in everything that she did. She encouraged my sister and me in all different ways. My mom always said, 'You're a good cook, you'll make a fine scientist,' when I told her that I like science. So I think those kinds of little things maybe are more important that any of the bigger things.\"[2]/nFuchs earned a B.S. in chemistry in 1972 from the University of Illinois, graduating with highest distinction in the Chemical Sciences. She began as one of only three women in an undergraduate physics class of 200. Fuchs was politically active during college, protesting the Vietnam War and applying to the Peace Corps with the intention of being posted in Chile. However, when she was instead assigned to Uganda, then under the dictatorship of Idi Amin, she elected to go directly to graduate school.[1]/nWhen applying to graduate school, Fuchs refused to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). During an interview in 2009, Fuchs stated, \u201c\u2026I felt that the Graduate Record Examination wasn\u2019t testing my real knowledge, but rather how I could perform in a written exam.\u201d Instead, she submitted a three-page explanation with her applications explaining why she would not be taking the GRE. Though she was accepted everywhere she applied, she admits that her defiant statement would not likely be looked upon the same way today. \u201cI don\u2019t think professors are as open-minded toward rebellious students as they were during the Vietnam War era.\u201d [3]/nFuchs earned her Ph.D. in biochemical sciences from Princeton University in 1977. Her doctoral dissertation was titled \"The biosynthesis and assembly of the peptidoglycan sacculus of Bacillus Megatorium.\"[4] Fuchs began her work on skin biology during her postdoctoral work with Howard Green at MIT. In Green's lab she studied the mechanisms underlying growth and differentiation in epidermal keratinocytes./nFuchs accepted a faculty position at the University of Chicago in 1980 and was the first woman in the biochemistry department.[5] Her first publications there reported the first cloning and sequencing of keratin cDNAs that characterized the two types of keratins.[6][7] At the University of Chicago she was mentored and befriended by Janet Rowley and Susan Lindquist; they eventually all joined the reorganized Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology, in which Fuchs was ultimately appointed the Amgen Professor of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology. In 2002, Fuchs accepted a position at Rockefeller University, where she is currently the Rebecca C. Lancefield Professor of Mammalian Cell Biology and Development and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Fuchs is known for her study of skin, identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying skin disease, developing the field of skin stem cells, and pioneering reverse genetics. Her research group uses laboratory mice and mammalian epithelial stem cell culture as model systems. Recently, she has been devoting her research to studies on the role stem cells play in the regeneration of tissue, as well as the competing demands of proliferation and differentiation in maintaining enough stem cells.[8][9]/nFuchs currently sits on the board of the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation. She was elected president of the American Society for Cell Biology in 2001. In 2009 Fuchs was awarded the United States\u2019 highest honor for scientific contributions, the National Medal of Science, by President Barack Obama.[10][11]/nIn 2015 she was awarded the American Society for Cell Biology's highest scientific honor, the E.B Wilson Medal.[12] In 2020 she received the Canada Gairdner International Award.[13]/nFuchs developed the reverse genetics approach when she began as an assistant professor at the University of Chicago.[14] Reverse genetics seeks to understand the genetic basis of a disease by examining how specific genetic modifications (such as the use of transgenes) affect phenotype, as opposed to forward genetics, which searches for genetic explanations to a specific phenotype. Fuchs first applied the technique by engineering a gene that affected keratin function and disrupted the framework of cells. Inserting this mutant keratin into transgenic mice caused heavy epidermal blistering; analysis showed this blistering to be nearly identical to the dermatological disorder epidermolysis bullosa simplex. Subsequent collaboration with dermatologists to obtain skin samples from patients with the dermatological disorder revealed that a similar mutation in keratin genes indeed underlies the condition.[15]/nFuchs and her team have conducted research on how cancerous stem cells called squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), some of the most common and dangerous cancers worldwide, interact with their microenvironments.[16] By examining skin cancer in mice, she concluded that the speed at which stem cells will divide and how they divide is dependent on their niche. She examined the inhibitory signaling molecule TGF-\u03b2, which is found near the blood vessels of a tumor. Although the effects of TGF-\u03b2 and how it restrains normal skin cell growth had been studied by researchers before Fuchs, she specifically looked at the intermediate steps of tumor progression by creating a TGF-\u03b2 reporter system. She accomplished this by developing tumor cells that expressed a gene commonly found in skin cancer cells, HRasD12V.[citation needed] Her research demonstrated that cancerous stem cells lacking the TGF-\u03b2 signal proliferate more quickly but are sensitive to antiproliferative drugs. In contrast, cancerous stem cells that received the TGF-\u03b2 signal proliferated at a slower rate than those lacking the TGF-\u03b2 signal but were resistant to antiproliferative drugs.[16] She showed the ability of TGF-\u03b2 to cause up-regulation of the glutathione pathway, which allowed the SCCs to counter the radical oxygen species often used in radiotherapy and chemotherapy.[17] Fuchs determined that both the factors internal to the cell and the cell's external surrounding environment have an effect on the stem cells\u2019 niche in both their ability to divide and how they divide.[16][18]/nFuchs is married to a fellow academic, David Hansen, a faculty member at Teachers College, Columbia University.[19][20] Her interests include travel, art, and photography.[20][21]/nThroughout her career, Fuchs has made a point of supporting young female scientists.[2] In an interview with Fiona Watt, an editor-in-chief for JCS, Fuchs details some of the challenges she faced as a woman pursuing a career in science and emphasizes the importance of role models: \"Senior women who are recognized by their peers as being successful have a responsibility to help educate those scientists who haven't quite accepted this important message. And we have a responsibility to maintain the highest scientific and ethical standards and to serve as the best role models we can for the younger generation of outstanding scientists \u2013 both men and women \u2013 who are rising through the ranks. Leading by good example is still the best way to diffuse the now more subtle and less vocal, but nevertheless lingering, discrimination and dogmatism against women scientists within our scientific community.\u201d [1] Because there were few women in leadership roles doing laboratory research when Fuchs began her career, she often faced subtle discrimination. She related a story from her early days in Chicago when a technician from one of the other labs, seeing her setting up her new lab, asked if she was Dr. Fuchs\u2019 new technician. She replied, \u201cI am Dr. Fuchs!\u201d[3]/nFuchs said of the L\u2019Oreal-UNESCO Award, \"It's also a wonderful concept to reward a woman from each of the five major regional areas in which science is being conducted around the world, in a celebration of not only women in science, but also the importance of science in a world community.\"[2]", "18004336": "Emanuel R\u00e1dl (December 21, 1873 \u2013 May 12, 1942) was an original Czech biologist, historian of science, philosopher and a critical supporter of Masaryk\u00b4s pre-war democratic Czechoslovakia.

He worked on the neural system of insects, on phototropism and on the evolution of sight. Influenced by the German biologist and philosopher Hans Driesch, he became interested in philosophy of life and in a large work The History of Biological Theories (in German 1905\u20131909, in English 1930; reprint in 1988) he criticized the evolutionism of the 19th century.[1] At the book's climax at the end of Chapter 33, R\u00e1dl dismisses Darwinism with the words/nWe may therefore sum up the modern position in Driesch's words: 'For those with insight Darwinism has been dead for a long time'...

He wrote books on Czech and German nationalism, on social justice, on the fundamental differences between the West and the East and very early against the misuse of racial theories and against antisemitism. Together with the Protestant theologian J. L. Hrom\u00e1dka he co-founded the Czech Academic YMCA and published numerous booklets on various public topics. In 1934 he presided the 8th International Congress of Philosophy in Prague, but after 1935 he was gradually excluded from public life by a serious illness. He died in 1942 in Prague during the German occupation in almost complete isolation. His posthumous book Consolation from Philosophy, in the oppressive mood of war, is a highly personal profession of faith in the lasting values of truth and religion and evoked a lively discussion after its publication in 1946.[2]/n\"How to save our civilization from decay?

They introduced the application of non-linear dimensionality reduction by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to visualize high-dimensional single-cell RNA sequencing data,[21] and the use of a nearest neighbors graph to represent the data manifold of RNA-defined cell states.[22] The Pe'er group used this formalization to identify discrete cell types or cell states by applying the Louvain community detection method to cluster data,[23] and demonstrated that cells can be ordered along differentiation trajectories from individual samples, due to the asynchrony of cells found in tissue samples.[22] By modeling trajectories as a Markov process, they showed that cells can be assigned probabilities for reaching any given terminal fate along a trajectory.[24] In 2020, the Pe'er and Fabian Theis groups presented CellRank, an algorithm that uncovers cellular dynamics by combining trajectories based on cell-cell similarity with local RNA velocity information, which identifies nascent transcriptional states by the proportion of spliced-to-unspliced RNA transcripts.[25]/nPe'er applies these methods to model biological questions around cellular plasticity and single-cell phenotypic variation in cancer, developmental biology, and immunology, including tumor microenvironments,[26] metastasis[26] and responses to treatments such as immunotherapy. \"We are beginning to understand that plasticity is a key hallmark of cancer,\" said Dr. Pe'er. \"It is the cancer cell's plasticity that allows it to make such a switch to survive.\"/nUpon accepting the International Society for Computational Biology's Overton Prize in 2014, Pe'er said, \"Math is rigorous, and biology is messy, so the trick is to find the pattern in the mess, and machine learning provides a powerful toolbox.\"[13]", "61716859": "Elisabeth Margaretha Harbers-Bik (born 1966) is a Dutch microbiologist and scientific integrity consultant.[1] Bik is known for her work detecting photo manipulation in scientific publications,[2][3][4] and identifying over 4,000 potential cases of improper research conduct,[5] including 400 research papers published by authors in China from a research paper mill company.

She was a full professor, first at Morehouse College, and then at the University of Atlanta from 1953 to her death. Her doctoral dissertation was on the study of chick embryos,[1] and she went on to do research with time-lapse microscopy (then called motion picture microphotography) in tissue cultures.[2]/nIn 1952, Reddick received a Ford science fellowship to study at Cambridge University.[3] Reddick was possibly the first African-American woman scientist to receive this fellowship for study abroad, and she was the first female biology instructor at Morehouse College.[1]/nMary Reddick was born in Atlanta, Georgia in 1914.[3] She graduated from the Laboratory High School and started majoring in biology at Spelman College in 1929 at the age of 15.[1] Spelman is a women's historically black college, affiliated with the University of Atlanta and Morehouse College. This affiliation enabled her to study with an African-American scientist at Morehouse, Samuel Milton Nabrit.[1] Her senior faculty at Spelman were both white female biologists.[1]/nReddick assisted in labs for four years after completing her bachelor's degree in science at Spelman.[3] She was awarded her bachelor's degree in 1935.[1]/nIn 1937, she received a Rockefeller Foundation General Education Board Fellowship, enabling her to gain a Masters of Science degree from the University of Atlanta, with a thesis studying the embryo chick blastoderm.[4]/nAfter gaining her Masters, Reddick began teaching biology at Spelman in 1937.[1] She became the first female biology instructor at Morehouse College in 1939.[1]/nIn 1942, Reddick was awarded a second Rockefeller education fellowship by Radcliffe College, the women's coordinate for Harvard University at that time.[3] Reddick studied techniques for transplanting tissues and nerve cell differentiation in chick embryos there for two years, gaining a second master's degree in biology in 1943 and being awarded a PhD in 1944.[1][3] Her doctoral dissertation was titled The differentiation of embryonic chick medulla in chorioallantoic grafts.[5]  She was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi honor societies.[1] Geraldine Pittman Woods was a classmate.[1] Reddick was the 10th member of Morehouse faculty to earn a doctorate.[1]/nReddick returned to Morehouse, and became the first female to act as chair of the biology department, later promoted to full professor.[1]/nIn 1952, Reddick was possibly the first African-American woman to receive a Ford Foundation science fellowship to study abroad, studying embryology at the School of Anatomy at Cambridge University. She returned to the US in 1953, and joined the faculty at the University of Atlanta, with the rank of full professor and named chair of the biology department.[1] During the 1950s and 1960s she supervised the research of more than 20 students, including Luther Williams.[6] She also gained a research grant from the National Science Foundation.[1] She held the position of Professor there until her death at the age of 51 in 1966.[1]/nReddick began her embryogenesis studies using the developing chicken embryo, specifically White Leghorns and Rhode Island Reds.[4] The larger question she addressed was what the developmental potential was of portions of the early chick blastoderm, when transplanted to the chorioallantoic membrane of a chick in a later stage of development, in \"cut-and-paste\" experiments.[4] These \"cut-and-paste\" experiments supported the hypothesis that the node is necessary and sufficient for specifying differentiation of many derivatives of ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm, but not all.[4] For instance, any cases of liver tissue development that she observed only occurred where there was heart tissue nearby.[4]/nFor her dissertation work at Radcliffe, Reddick studied neurodevelopment of the chick medulla.[7] For these experiments, she used embryos from Plymouth Rock chickens.[7] The goal of her experiments was to understand how much of that area of the brain was already determined and how much was dependent on interactions with surrounding developing tissues, such as notochord, somites, and ectoderm.[7] The results of these experiments supported the hypothesis that while some aspects of the post-otic medulla in chick have already been determined, there needs to be a continuous interaction with surrounding developing tissues.[7]/nSubsequent work addressed several technical problems in assessing cell differentiation.[8] For these experiments, Reddick used White Plymouth Rock chicken embryos.[8] One of the questions she addressed was whether nerve cells in the post-otic chick medulla became syncytial during development.[8] To try to get single developing nerve cells with long processes visible in one plane of focus under the microscope, Reddick used a \"smear\" technique of flattening tissue before fixing and staining it.[8] She also found that what had been thought of as two different cell types, was actually one cell type in different phases of the cell cycle.[8] Some of the cells were mitotic, and others were in the interphase.[8]", "51558808": "Bernhard Schmidt (born 20 May 1906 in Magdeburg, died 23 September 2003 in Esslingen am Neckar) was a German microbiologist.

He was a proponent of natural selection, and a leading figure in the mid-twentieth century modern synthesis. He was secretary of the Zoological Society of London (1935\u20131942), the first Director of UNESCO, a founding member of the World Wildlife Fund, the president of the British Eugenics Society (1959-1962), and the first President of the British Humanist Association./nHuxley was well known for his presentation of science in books and articles, and on radio and television. He directed an Oscar-winning wildlife film. He was awarded UNESCO's Kalinga Prize for the popularisation of science in 1953, the Darwin Medal of the Royal Society in 1956,[1] and the Darwin\u2013Wallace Medal of the Linnaean Society in 1958. He was also knighted in the 1958 New Year Honours, a hundred years after Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace announced the theory of evolution by natural selection. In 1956 he received a Special Award from the Lasker Foundation in the category Planned Parenthood \u2013 World Population./nHuxley came from the Huxley family on his father's side and the Arnold family on his mother's.[2] His great-grandfather was Thomas Arnold of Rugby School, his great-uncle Matthew Arnold, and his aunt, Mrs Humphry Ward. His grandfather Thomas Henry Huxley was raised Anglican but eventually became an advocate of Agnosticism, a word he coined.[3] Thomas was also a friend and supporter of Charles Darwin and proponent of evolution.[citation needed]/nHuxley's father was a writer and an editor Leonard Huxley and his mother was Julia Arnold, a graduate of Somerville College,  Oxford, who had gained a First in English Literature there in 1882. Julia and Leonard married in 1885 and they had four children: Margaret (1899\u20131981), the novelist Aldous, Trevenen and Julian.[2]/nHuxley was born on 22 June 1887, at the London house of his aunt. His mother died in 1908, when he was 21. In 1912, his father married Rosalind Bruce, who was the same age as Julian, and he later acquired half-brothers Andrew Huxley and David Huxley.[2]/nIn 1911, Huxley became informally engaged to  Kathleen Fordham, whom he had met some years earlier when she was a pupil at Prior's Field, the school his mother had run. During 1913 the relationship broke down[2]  and Huxley had a nervous breakdown which a biographer described as caused by 'conflict between desire and guilt'.[4]/nIn the first months of 1914 Huxley had severe depression and lived for some weeks at The Hermitage, a small private nursing home. In August 1914 while Huxley was in Scotland, his brother Trevenen also had a nervous breakdown and stayed in the same nursing home. Trevenen was worried about how he had treated one of his women friends and committed suicide whilst there.[2]/nIn 1919, Huxley married Juliette Baillot (1896\u20131994) a French Swiss woman whom he had met while she was employed as a governess at Garsington Manor, the country house of Lady Ottoline Morrell. Huxley was later unfaithful to Baillot and told her that he wanted an open marriage.[5] One of his affairs was with the poet May Sarton who in turn fell in love with Baillot and had a brief affair with her as well.[5]/nHuxley described himself in print as suffering from manic depression, and his wife's autobiography suggests that Julian Huxley suffered from  a bipolar disorder.[1][6] He relied on his wife to provide moral and practical support throughout his life.[1]/nSir Julian and Lady Juliette Huxley had two sons: Anthony Huxley (1920\u20131992) and Francis Huxley (1923\u20132016), who both became scientists.[citation needed]/nHuxley grew up at the family home in Shackleford, Surrey, England, where he showed an early interest in nature, as he was given lessons by his grandfather, Thomas Henry Huxley. When he heard his grandfather talking at dinner about the lack of parental care in fish, Julian piped up with \"What about the stickleback, Gran'pater?\". His grandfather also took him to visit Joseph Dalton Hooker at Kew.[7] At the age of thirteen Huxley attended Eton College as a King's Scholar, and continued to develop scientific interests; his grandfather had influenced the school to build science laboratories much earlier. At Eton he developed an interest in ornithology, guided by science master W. D. \"Piggy\" Hill. \"Piggy was a genius as a teacher\u00a0... I have always been grateful to him.\"[8] In 1905 Huxley won a scholarship in Zoology to Balliol College, Oxford and took up the place in 1906 after spending the summer in Germany. He developed a particular interest in embryology and protozoa and developed a friendship with the ornithologist William Warde Fowler.[9] In the autumn term of his final year, 1908, his mother died from cancer at  the age of 46. In his final year he won the Newdigate Prize for his poem \"Holyrood\". In 1909 he graduated with first class honours, and spent that July at the international gathering for the centenary of Darwin's birth, held at the University of Cambridge./nHuxley was awarded a scholarship to spend a year at the Naples Marine Biological Station, where he developed his interest in developmental biology by investigating sea squirts and sea urchins. In 1910 he was appointed as Demonstrator in the Department of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at the University of Oxford, and started on the systematic observation of the courtship habits of water birds, such as the common redshank (a wader) and grebes (which are divers). Bird watching in childhood had given Huxley his interest in ornithology, and he helped devise systems for the surveying and conservation of birds. His particular interest was bird behaviour, especially the courtship of water birds. His 1914 paper on the great crested grebe, later published as a book, was a landmark in avian ethology; his invention of vivid labels for the rituals (such as 'penguin dance', 'plesiosaurus race' etc.) made the ideas memorable and interesting to the general reader.[10]/nIn 1912 Huxley was asked by Edgar Odell Lovett to set up the Department of Biology at the newly created Rice Institute (now Rice University) in Houston, Texas, which he accepted, planning to start the following year. Huxley made an exploratory trip to the United States in September 1912, visiting a number of leading universities as well as the Rice Institute. At T. H. Morgan's fly lab (Columbia University) he invited H.\u00a0J. Muller to join him at Rice. Muller agreed to be his deputy, hurried to complete his PhD and moved to Houston for the beginning of the 1915\u20131916 academic year. At Rice, Muller taught biology and continued Drosophila lab work./nBefore taking up the post of Assistant Professor at the Rice Institute, Huxley spent a year in Germany preparing for his demanding new job. Working in a laboratory just months before the outbreak of World War I, Huxley overheard fellow academics comment on a passing aircraft \"it will not be long before those planes are flying over England\"./nOne pleasure of Huxley's life in Texas was the sight of his first hummingbird, though his visit to Edward Avery McIlhenny's estate on Avery Island in Louisiana was more significant. The McIlhennys and their Avery cousins owned the entire island, and the McIlhenny branch used it to produce their famous Tabasco sauce. Birds were one of McIlhenny's passions, however, and around 1895 he had set up a private sanctuary on the Island, called Bird City. There Huxley found egrets, herons and bitterns. These water birds, like the grebes, exhibit mutual courtship, with the pairs displaying to each other, and with the secondary sexual characteristics equally developed in both sexes.[11]/nIn September 1916 Huxley returned to England from Texas to assist in the war effort. He was commissioned a temporary second lieutenant in the Royal Army Service Corps on 25 May 1917,[12] and was transferred to the General List, working in the British Army Intelligence Corps from 26 January 1918, first in Sussex, and then in northern Italy.[13] He was advanced in grade within the Intelligence Corps on 3 May 1918,[14] relinquished his intelligence appointment on 10 January 1919 and was demobilised five days later, retaining his rank.[15][16] After the war he became a Fellow at New College, Oxford, and was made Senior Demonstrator in the University Department of Zoology. In fact, Huxley took the place of his old tutor Geoffrey Smith, who had been killed in the battle of the Somme on the Western Front. The ecological geneticist E. B. Ford always remembered his openness and encouragement at the start of his career.[6][17]/nIn 1925 Huxley moved to King's College London as Professor of Zoology, but in 1927, to the amazement of his colleagues and on the prodding of H. G. Wells whom he had promised 1,000 words a day,[18] he resigned his chair to work full-time with Wells and his son G. P. Wells on The Science of Life (see below). For some time Huxley retained his room at King's College, continuing as Honorary Lecturer in the Zoology Department, and from 1927 to 1931 he was also Fullerian Professor of Physiology at the Royal Institution, where he gave an annual lectures series, but this marked the end of his life as a university academic./nIn 1929, after finishing work on The Science of Life, Huxley visited East Africa to advise the Colonial Office on education in British East Africa (for the most part Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika). He discovered that the wildlife on the Serengeti plain was almost undisturbed because the tsetse fly (the vector for the trypanosome parasite which causes sleeping sickness in humans) prevented human settlement there. He tells about these experiences in Africa view (1931), and so does his wife.[19] She reveals that he fell in love with an 18-year-old American girl on board ship (when Juliette was not present), and then presented Juliette with his ideas for an open marriage: \"What Julian really wanted was\u2026 a definite freedom from the conventional bonds of marriage.\" The couple separated for a while; Julian travelled to the US, hoping to land a suitable appointment and, in due course, to marry Miss Weldmeier. He left no account of what transpired, but he was evidently not successful, and returned to England to resume his marriage in 1931. For the next couple of years Huxley still angled for an appointment in the US, without success.[20]/nAs the 1930s started, Huxley travelled widely and took part in a variety of activities which were partly scientific and partly political. In 1931 Huxley visited the USSR at the invitation of Intourist, where initially he admired the results of social and economic planning on a large scale. Later, back in the United Kingdom, he became a founding member of the think tank Political and Economic Planning./nIn the 1930s Huxley visited Kenya and other East African countries to see the conservation work, including the creation of national parks./nIn 1933, he was one of eleven people[a] involved in the appeal that led to the foundation of the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), an organisation for the study of birds in the British Isles.[21] From 1933 to 1938 he was a member of the committee for Lord Hailey's African Survey./nIn 1935 Huxley was appointed secretary to the Zoological Society of London, and spent much of the next seven years running the society and its zoological gardens, the London Zoo and Whipsnade Park, alongside his writing and research. The previous Director, Peter Chalmers Mitchell, had been in post for many years, and had skillfully avoided conflict with the Fellows and Council. Things were rather different when Huxley arrived. Huxley was not a skilled administrator; his wife said \"He was impatient\u2026 and lacked tact\".[22] He instituted a number of changes and innovations, more than some approved of. For example, Huxley introduced a whole range of ideas designed to make the Zoo child-friendly. Today, this would pass without comment; but then it was more controversial. He fenced off the Fellows' Lawn to establish Pets Corner; he appointed new assistant curators, encouraging them to talk to children; he initiated the Zoo Magazine.[23] Fellows and their guests had the privilege of free entry on Sundays, a closed day to the general public. Today, that would be unthinkable, and Sundays are now open to the public. Huxley's mild suggestion (that the guests should pay) encroached on territory the Fellows thought was theirs by right./nIn 1941 Huxley was invited to the United States on a lecturing tour, and generated some controversy by saying that he thought the United States should join World War II: a few weeks later came the attack on Pearl Harbor. When the US joined the war, he found it difficult to get a passage back to the UK, and his lecture tour was extended. The Council of the Zoological Society\u2014\"a curious assemblage\u2026 of wealthy amateurs, self-perpetuating and autocratic\"[24]\u2014uneasy with their secretary, used this as an opportunity to remove him. This they did by abolishing his post \"to save expenses\". Since Huxley had taken a half-salary cut at the start of the war, and no salary at all whilst he was in America, the council's action was widely read as a personal attack on Huxley. A public controversy ensued, but eventually the Council got its way./nIn 1943 he was asked by the British government to join the Colonial Commission on Higher Education. The commission's remit was to survey the West African Commonwealth countries for suitable locations for the creation of universities. There he acquired a disease, went down with hepatitis, and had a serious mental breakdown. He was completely disabled, treated with ECT, and took a full year to recover. He was 55./nIn 1945, Huxley proposed to melt the polar ice caps by igniting atomic bombs to moderate the world climate in the northern hemisphere, and permit shipping across the top of the world.[25][26]/nHuxley, a lifelong internationalist with a concern for education, got involved in the creation of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and became the organization's first director-general in 1946. His term of office, six years in the Charter, was cut down to two years at the behest of the American delegation.[27] The reasons are not known for sure, but his left-wing tendencies and humanism were likely factors. In a fortnight he dashed off a 60-page booklet on the purpose and philosophy of UNESCO, eventually printed and issued as an official document. There were, however, many conservative opponents of his scientific humanism. His idea of restraining population growth with birth control was anathema to both the Catholic Church and the Comintern/Cominform. In its first few years UNESCO was dynamic and broke new ground; since Huxley it has become larger, more bureaucratic and stable.[28][29] The personal and social side of the years in Paris are well described by his wife.[30]/nHuxley's internationalist and conservation interests also led him, with Victor Stolan, Sir Peter Scott, Max Nicholson and Guy Mountfort, to set up the WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature under its former name of the World Wildlife Fund)./nAnother post-war activity was Huxley's attack on the Soviet politico-scientist Trofim Lysenko, who had espoused a Lamarckian heredity, made unscientific pronouncements on agriculture, used his influence to destroy classical genetics in Russia and to move genuine scientists from their posts. In 1940, the leading botanical geneticist Nikolai Vavilov was arrested, and Lysenko replaced him as director of the Institute of Genetics. In 1941, Vavilov was tried, found guilty of 'sabotage' and sentenced to death. Reprieved, he died in jail of malnutrition in 1943. Lysenko's machinations were the cause of his arrest. Worse still, Lysenkoism not only denied proven genetic facts, it stopped the artificial selection of crops on Darwinian principles. This may have contributed to the regular shortage of food from the Soviet agricultural system (Soviet famines). Huxley, who had twice visited the Soviet Union, was originally not anti-communist, but the ruthless adoption of Lysenkoism by Joseph Stalin ended his tolerant attitude.[31] Lysenko ended his days in a Soviet mental hospital, and Vavilov's reputation was posthumously restored in 1955./nIn the 1950s Huxley played a role in bringing to the English-speaking public the work of the French Jesuit-palaeontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, who he believed had been unfairly treated by the Catholic and Jesuit hierarchy. Both men believed in evolution, but differed in its interpretation as Teilhard de Chardin was a Christian, whilst Huxley was an atheist. Huxley wrote the foreword to The Phenomenon of Man (1959) and was bitterly attacked by his rationalist friends for doing so.[32]/nOn Huxley's death at 87 on 14 February 1975, John Owen (Director of National Parks for Tanganyika) wrote \"Julian Huxley was one of the world's great men\u2026 he played a seminal role in wild life conservation in [East] Africa in the early days\u2026 [and in] the far-reaching influence he exerted [on] the international community\".[33]/nIn addition to his international and humanist concerns, his research interests covered evolution in all its aspects, ethology, embryology, genetics, anthropology and to some extent the infant field of cell biology. Julian's eminence as an advocate for evolution, and especially his contribution to the modern evolutionary synthesis, led to his awards of the Darwin Medal of the Royal Society in 1956,[1] and the Darwin\u2013Wallace Medal of the Linnaean Society in 1958. 1958 was the centenary anniversary of the joint presentation On the tendency of species to form varieties; and the perpetuation of varieties and species by natural means of selection by Darwin and Wallace.[34]/nHuxley was a friend and mentor of the biologists and Nobel laureates Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen,[35] and taught and encouraged many others. In general, he was more of an all-round naturalist than his famous grandfather,[36] and contributed much to the acceptance of natural selection. His outlook was international, and somewhat idealistic: his interest in progress and evolutionary humanism runs through much of his published work.[37] He was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.[38]/nHuxley and biologist August Weismann insisted on natural selection as the primary agent in evolution. Huxley was a major player in the mid-twentieth century modern evolutionary synthesis. He was a prominent populariser of biological science to the public, with a focus on three aspects in particular./nIn the early 20th century he was one of the minority of biologists[39] who believed that natural selection was the main driving force of evolution, and that evolution occurred by small steps and not by saltation (jumps). These opinions are now standard.[40]Though his time as an academic was quite brief, he taught and encouraged evolutionary biologists at the University of Oxford in the 1920s. Charles Elton (ecology), Alister Hardy (marine biology) and John Baker (cytology) all became highly successful, and Baker eventually wrote Huxley's Royal Society obituary memoir.[1][41] Perhaps the most significant was Edmund Brisco Ford, who founded a field of research called ecological genetics, which played a role in the evolutionary synthesis. Another important disciple was Gavin de Beer, who wrote on evolution and development, and became Director of the Natural History Museum. Both these scholars had attended Huxley's lectures on genetics, experimental zoology (including embryology) and ethology. Later, they became his collaborators, and then leaders in their own right./nIn an era when scientists did not travel so frequently as today, Huxley travelled widely in Europe, Africa and the United States. He was therefore able to learn from and influence other scientists, naturalists and administrators. In the US he was able to meet other evolutionists at a critical time in the reassessment of natural selection. In Africa he was able to influence colonial administrators about education and wildlife conservation. In Europe, through UNESCO, he was at the centre of the post-World War II revival of education. In Russia, however, his experiences were mixed. His initially favourable view was changed by his growing awareness of Stalin's murderous repression, and the Lysenko affair.[42] There seems little evidence that he had any effect on the Soviet Union, and the same could be said for some other Western scientists. \"Marxist-Leninism had become a dogmatic religion\u2026 and like all dogmatic religions, it had turned from reform to persecution.\"[43]/nHuxley was one of the main architects of the modern evolutionary synthesis which took place around the time of World War II. The synthesis of genetic and population ideas produced a consensus which reigned in biology from about 1940, and which is still broadly tenable. \"The most informative episode in the history of evolutionary biology was the establishment of the 'neo-Darwinian synthesis'.\"[44] The synthesis was brought about \"not by one side being proved right and the others wrong, but by the exchange of the most viable components of the previously competing research strategies\". Ernst Mayr, 1980.[45]/nHuxley's first 'trial run' was the treatment of evolution in the Science of Life (1929\u201330), and in 1936 he published a long and significant paper for the British Association.[46] In 1938 came three lengthy reviews on major evolutionary topics.[47][48][49] Two of these papers were on the subject of sexual selection, an idea of Darwin's whose standing has been revived in recent times.[50][51] Huxley thought that sexual selection was \"\u2026merely an aspect of natural selection which\u2026 is concerned with characters which subserve mating, and are usually sex-limited\". This rather grudging acceptance of sexual selection was influenced by his studies on the courtship of the great crested grebe (and other birds that pair for life): the courtship takes place mostly after mate selection, not before.\nHuxley tackled the subject of evolution at full length, in what became the defining work of his life. His role was that of a synthesiser, and it helped that he had met many of the other participants. His book Evolution: The Modern Synthesis was written whilst he was secretary to the Zoological Society, and made use of his collection of reprints covering the first part of the century. It was published in 1942. Reviews of the book in learned journals were little short of ecstatic; the American Naturalist called it \"The outstanding evolutionary treatise of the decade, perhaps of the century. The approach is thoroughly scientific; the command of basic information amazing\".[52][53]/nHuxley's main co-respondents in the modern evolutionary synthesis are usually listed as Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, George Gaylord Simpson, Bernhard Rensch, Ledyard Stebbins and the population geneticists J. B. S. Haldane, Ronald Fisher and Sewall Wright. However, at the time of Huxley's book several of these had yet to make their distinctive contribution. Certainly, for Huxley, E. B. Ford and his co-workers in ecological genetics were at least as important; and Cyril Darlington, the chromosome expert, was a notable source of facts and ideas.An analysis of the 'authorities cited' index of Evolution the modern synthesis shows indirectly those whom Huxley regarded as the most important contributors to the synthesis up to 1941 (the book was published in 1942, and references go up to 1941). The authorities cited 20 or more times are: Darlington, Darwin, Dobzhansky, Fisher, Ford, Goldschmidt, Haldane, J. S. Huxley, Muller, Rensch, Turrill, Wright./nGoldschmidt was an influential geneticist who advocated evolution by saltation, and was sometimes mentioned in disagreement. Turrill provided Huxley with botanical information. The list omits three key members of the synthesis who are listed above: Mayr, Stebbins the botanist and Simpson the palaeontologist. Mayr gets 16 citations and more in the two later editions; all three published outstanding and relevant books some years later, and their contribution to the synthesis is unquestionable. Their lesser weight in Huxley's citations was caused by the early publication date of his book. Huxley's book is not strong in palaeontology, which illustrates perfectly why Simpson's later works were such an important contribution./nHuxley coined the terms the new synthesis and evolutionary synthesis;[54] he also invented the term cline in 1938 to refer to species whose members fall into a series of sub-species with continuous change in characters over a geographical area.[55][56] The classic example of a cline is the circle of subspecies of the gull Larus round the Arctic zone. This cline is an example of a ring species.Some of Huxley's last contributions to the evolutionary synthesis were on the subject of ecological genetics. He noted how widespread polymorphism is in nature, with visible morphism much more prevalent in some groups than others. The immense diversity of colour and pattern in small bivalve molluscs, brittlestars, sea-anemones, tubicular polychaetes and various grasshoppers is perhaps maintained by making recognition by predators more difficult.[57][58][59]/nAlthough Huxley believed that on a broad view evolution led to advances in organisation, he rejected  classical Aristotelian teleology: \"The ordinary man, or at least the ordinary poet, philosopher and theologian, always was anxious to find purpose in the evolutionary process. I believe this reasoning to be totally false.\".[60] Huxley coined the phrase Progress without a goal to summarise his case in Evolution the modern synthesis  that  evolutionary progress was \"a raising of the upper level of biological efficiency, this being defined as increased control over and independence of the environment.\"[61] In Evolution in action he wrote that/nNatural selection plus time produces biological improvement\u2026 'Improvement' is not yet a recognised technical term in biology \u2026 however, living things are improved during evolution\u2026 Darwin was not afraid to use the word for the results of natural selection in general\u2026 I believe that improvement can become one of the key concepts in evolutionary biology.Can it be scientifically defined? Improvements in biological machinery\u2026 the limbs and teeth of grazing horses\u2026 the increase in brain-power\u2026 The eyes of a dragon-fly, which can see all round [it] in every direction, are an improvement over the mere microscopic eye-spots of early forms of life.[62] [Over] the whole range of evolutionary time we see general advance\u2014improvement in all the main properties of life, including its general organization. 'Advance' is thus a useful term for long-term improvement in some general property of life. [But] improvement is not universal. Lower forms manage to survive alongside higher\".[63]/nHuxley's views on progressive evolution were similar to those of G. Ledyard Stebbins[64] and Bernhard Rensch,[65] and were challenged in the latter part of the twentieth century with objections from Cladists, among others,  to any suggestion that one group could be scientifically described as 'advanced' and another as 'primitive'. Modern assessments of these views have been surveyed in Nitecki[66] and Dawkins.[67]/nHuxley's humanism[68] came from his appreciation that mankind was in charge of its own destiny (at least in principle), and this raised the need for a sense of direction and a system of ethics. His grandfather T. H. Huxley, when faced with similar problems, had promoted agnosticism, but Julian chose humanism as being more directed to supplying a basis for ethics. Julian's thinking went along these lines: \"The critical point in the evolution of man\u2026 was when he acquired the use of [language]\u2026 Man's development is potentially open\u2026 He has developed a new method of evolution: the transmission of organized experience by way of tradition, which\u2026 largely overrides the automatic process of natural selection as the agent of change.\"[69] Both Huxley and his grandfather gave Romanes Lectures on the possible connection between evolution and ethics[70] (see evolutionary ethics). Huxley's views on God could be described as being that of an agnostic atheist.[71][72]/nHuxley had a close association with the British rationalist and secular humanist movements. He was an Honorary Associate of the Rationalist Press Association from 1927 until his death, and on the formation of the British Humanist Association in 1963 became its first President, to be succeeded by AJ Ayer in 1965. He was also closely involved with the International Humanist and Ethical Union. Many of Huxley's books address humanist themes. In 1962 Huxley accepted the American Humanist Association's annual \"Humanist of the Year\" award./nHuxley also presided over the founding Congress of the International Humanist and Ethical Union and served with John Dewey, Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann on the founding advisory board of the First Humanist Society of New York./nHuxley wrote that \"There is no separate supernatural realm: all phenomena are part of one natural process of evolution. There is no basic cleavage between science and religion;\u2026 I believe that [a] drastic reorganization of our pattern of religious thought is now becoming necessary, from a god-centered to an evolutionary-centred pattern.\"[73] Some believe the appropriate label for these views is religious naturalism.[74]/nMany people assert that this abandonment of the god hypothesis means the abandonment of all religion and all moral sanctions. This is simply not true. But it does mean, once our relief at jettisoning an outdated piece of ideological furniture is over, that we must construct something to take its place.[73]/nHuxley took interest in investigating the claims of parapsychology and spiritualism. He joined the Society for Psychical Research in 1928. After investigation he found the field to be unscientific and full of charlatans.[75] In 1934, he joined the International Institute for Psychical Research but resigned after a few months due to its members' spiritualist bias and non-scientific approach to the subject.[76][77]/nAfter attending s\u00e9ances, Huxley concluded that the phenomena could be explained \"either by natural causes, or, more usually by fraud\".[78] Huxley, Harold Dearden and others were judges for a group formed by the Sunday Chronicle to investigate the materialization medium Harold Evans. During a s\u00e9ance Evans was exposed as a fraud. He was caught masquerading as a spirit, in a white nightshirt.[79]/nIn 1952, Huxley wrote the foreword to Donovan Rawcliffe's The Psychology of the Occult.[80]/nHuxley was a prominent member of the British Eugenics Society,[81] and was Vice-President (1937\u20131944) and President (1959\u20131962). He thought eugenics was important for removing undesirable variants from the human gene pool, though after World War II he believed race was a meaningless concept in biology, and its application to humans was highly inconsistent.[82]/nHuxley was an outspoken critic of the most extreme eugenicism in the 1920s and 1930s (the stimulus for which was the greater fertility of the 'feckless' poor compared to the 'responsible' prosperous classes). He was, nevertheless, a leading figure in the eugenics movement (see, for example, Eugenics manifesto). He gave the Galton memorial lecture twice, in 1936 and 1962. In his writing he used this argument several times: \"no one doubts the wisdom of managing the germ plasm of agricultural stocks, so why not apply the same concept to human stocks?\" The agricultural analogy appears over and over again as it did in the writings of many American eugenicists.[83]/nHuxley was one of many intellectuals at the time who believed that the lowest class in society was genetically inferior.[citation needed] In this passage, from 1941, he investigates a hypothetical scenario where Social Darwinism, capitalism, nationalism and the class society is taken for granted:/nIf so, then we must plan our eugenic policy along some such lines as the following:... The lowest strata, allegedly less well-endowed genetically, are reproducing relatively too fast. Therefore birth-control methods must be taught them; they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive; long unemployment should be a ground for sterilization, or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world; and so on. That is to say, much of our eugenic programme will be curative and remedial merely, instead of preventive and constructive.[84]/nThe sentiment is not at all atypical of the time, and similar views were held by many geneticists (William E. Castle, C. B. Davenport, H. J. Muller are examples), and by other prominent intellectuals./nHuxley advocated ensuring the lower classes have a nutritious diet, education and facilities for recreation:/nWe must therefore concentrate on producing a single equalized environment; and this clearly should be one as favourable as possible to the expression of the genetic qualities that we think desirable. Equally clearly, this should include the following items. A marked raising of the standard of diet for the great majority of the population, until all should be provided both with adequate calories and adequate accessory factors; provision of facilities for healthy exercise and recreation; and upward equalization of educational opportunity. ... we know from various sources that raising the standard of life among the poorest classes almost invariably results in a lowering of their fertility. In so far, therefore, as differential class-fertility exists, raising the environmental level will reduce any dysgenic effects which it may now have.[85]/nConcerning a public health and racial policy in general, Huxley wrote that \"\u2026unless [civilised societies] invent and enforce adequate measures for regulating human reproduction, for controlling the quantity of population, and at least preventing the deterioration of quality of racial stock, they are doomed to decay \u2026\"[86] and remarked how biology should be the chief tool for rendering social politics scientific./nIn the opinion of Duvall, \"His views fell well within the spectrum of opinion acceptable to the English liberal intellectual elite. He shared Nature's enthusiasm for birth control, and 'voluntary' sterilization.\"[87] However, the word 'English' in this passage is unnecessary: such views were widespread.[88] Duvall comments that Huxley's enthusiasm for centralised social and economic planning and anti-industrial values was common to leftist ideologists during the inter-war years. Towards the end of his life, Huxley himself must have recognised how unpopular these views became after the end of World War II. In the two volumes of his autobiography, there is no mention of eugenics in the index, nor is Galton mentioned; and the subject has also been omitted from many of the obituaries and biographies. An exception is the proceedings of a conference organised by the British Eugenics Society.[89]/nIn response to the rise of European fascism in the 1930s, he was asked to write We Europeans with the ethnologist A. C. Haddon, the zoologist Alexander Carr-Saunders and the historian of science Charles Singer. Huxley suggested the word 'race' be replaced with ethnic group. After the Second World War, he was instrumental in producing the UNESCO statement The Race Question,[90] which asserted that:/nA race, from the biological standpoint, may therefore be defined as one of the group of populations constituting the species Homo sapiens\"\u2026 \"National, religious, geographic, linguistic and cult groups do not necessary coincide with racial groups: the cultural traits of such groups have no demonstrated genetic connexion with racial traits. Because serious errors of this kind are habitually committed when the term 'race' is used in popular parlance, it would be better when speaking of human races to drop the term 'race' altogether and speak of ethnic groups\"\u2026 \"Now what has the scientist to say about the groups of mankind which may be recognized at the present time? Human races can be and have been differently classified by different anthropologists, but at the present time most anthropologists agree on classifying the greater part of present-day mankind into three major divisions, as follows: The Mongoloid Division; The Negroid Division; The Caucasoid Division.\" \u2026 \"Catholics, Protestants, Moslems and Jews are not races \u2026 The biological fact of race and the myth of 'race' should be distinguished. For all practical social purposes 'race' is not so much a biological phenomenon as a social myth. The myth 'race' has created an enormous amount of human and social damage. In recent years it has taken a heavy toll in human lives and caused untold suffering. It still prevents the normal development of millions of human beings and deprives civilization of the effective co-operation of productive minds. The biological differences between ethnic groups should be disregarded from the standpoint of social acceptance and social action. The unity of mankind from both the biological and social viewpoint is the main thing. To recognize this and to act accordingly is the first requirement of modern man\u00a0.../nHuxley won the second Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for We Europeans in 1937./nIn 1951, Huxley popularized the term transhumanism for the view that humans should better themselves through science and technology, possibly including eugenics, but also, importantly, the improvement of the social environment./nHuxley was a capable and willing popularizer of science. Well over half his books are addressed to an educated general audience, and he wrote often in periodicals and newspapers. The most extensive bibliography of Huxley lists some of these ephemeral articles, though there are others unrecorded.[91]/nThese articles, some reissued as Essays of a Biologist (1923), probably led to the invitation from H.\u00a0G. Wells to help write a comprehensive work on biology for a general readership, The Science of Life.[30] This work was published in stages in 1929\u201330,[92] and in one volume in 1931. Of this Robert Olby said \"Book IV The essence of the controversies about evolution offers perhaps the clearest, most readable, succinct and informative popular account of the subject ever penned. It was here that he first expounded his own version of what later developed into the evolutionary synthesis\".[93][94] In his memoirs, Huxley says that he made almost \u00a310,000 from the book.[95]/nIn 1934 Huxley collaborated with the naturalist Ronald Lockley to create for Alexander Korda the world's first natural history documentary The Private Life of the Gannets. For the film, shot with the support of the Royal Navy around Grassholm off the Pembrokeshire coast, they won an Oscar for best documentary.[96]/nHuxley had given talks on the radio since the 1920s, followed by written versions in The Listener. In later life, he became known to an even wider audience through television. In 1939 the BBC asked him to be a regular panelist on a Home Service general knowledge show, The Brains Trust, in which he and other panelists were asked to discuss questions submitted by listeners. The show was commissioned to keep up war time morale, by preventing the war from \"disrupting the normal discussion of interesting ideas\". The audience was not large for this somewhat elite programme; however, listener research ranked Huxley the most popular member of the Brains Trust from 1941 to 1944.[97][98]/nLater, he was a regular panelist on one of the BBC's first quiz shows (1955) Animal, Vegetable, Mineral? in which participants were asked to talk about objects chosen from museum and university collections./nIn 1937 Huxley was invited to deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on Rare Animals and the Disappearance of Wild Life./nIn his essay The Crowded World Huxley was openly critical of Communist and Catholic attitudes to birth control, population control and overpopulation. Based on variable rates of compound interest, Huxley predicted a probable world population of 6\u00a0billion by 2000. The United Nations Population Fund marked 12 October 1999 as The Day of Six Billion.[99][100]/nThere is a public house named after Sir Julian in Selsdon, London Borough of Croydon, close to the Selsdon Wood Nature Reserve which he helped establish.", "145842": "Sir Andrew Fielding Huxley OM FRS HonFREng (22 November 1917\u00a0\u2013 30 May 2012) was an English physiologist and biophysicist.[1][2] He was born into the prominent Huxley family. After leaving Westminster School in central London, he went to Trinity College, Cambridge on a scholarship, after which he joined Alan Hodgkin to study nerve impulses. Their eventual discovery of the basis for propagation of nerve impulses (called an action potential) earned them the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1963. They made their discovery from the giant axon of the Atlantic squid. Soon after the outbreak of the Second World War, Huxley was recruited by the British Anti-Aircraft Command and later transferred to the Admiralty. After the war he resumed research at the University of Cambridge, where he developed interference microscopy that would be suitable for studying muscle fibres./nIn 1952, he was joined by a German physiologist Rolf Niedergerke. Together they discovered in 1954 the mechanism of muscle contraction, popularly called the \"sliding filament theory\", which is the foundation of our modern understanding of muscle mechanics. In 1960 he became head of the Department of Physiology at University College London. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1955, and President in 1980. The Royal Society awarded him the Copley Medal in 1973 for his collective contributions to the understanding of nerve impulses and muscle contraction. He was conferred a Knight Bachelor by the Queen in 1974, and was appointed to the Order of Merit in 1983. He was a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, until his death./nHuxley was born in Hampstead, London, England, on 22 November 1917. He was the youngest son of the writer and editor Leonard Huxley by Leonard Huxley's second wife Rosalind Bruce, and hence half-brother of the writer Aldous Huxley and fellow biologist Julian Huxley, and grandson of the biologist T. H. Huxley./nWhen he was about 12, Andrew and his brother David were given a lathe by their parents. Andrew soon became proficient at designing, making and assembling mechanical objects of all kinds, from wooden candle sticks to a working internal combustion engine. He used these practical skills throughout his career, building much of the specialized equipment he needed for his research. It was also in his early teens that he formed his lifelong interest in microscopy.[3]/nHe was educated at University College School and Westminster School in Central London, where he was a King's Scholar. He graduated and won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, to read natural sciences. He had intended to become an engineer but switched to physiology after taking the subject to fulfill an elective.[4]/nHaving entered Cambridge in 1935, Huxley graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1938. In 1939, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin returned from the US to take up a fellowship at Trinity College, and Huxley became one of his postgraduate students. Hodgkin was interested in the transmission of electrical signals along nerve fibres. Beginning in 1935 in Cambridge, he had made preliminary measurements on frog sciatic nerves suggesting that the accepted view of the nerve as a simple, elongated battery was flawed. Hodgkin invited Huxley to join him researching the problem. The work was experimentally challenging. One major problem was that the small size of most neurons made it extremely difficult to study them using the techniques of the time. They overcame this by working at the Marine Biological Association laboratory in Plymouth using the giant axon of the longfin inshore squid (Doryteuthis (formerly Loligo) pealeii), which have the largest neurons known.[5] The experiments were still extremely challenging as the nerve impulses only last a fraction of a millisecond, during which time they needed to measure the changing electrical potential at different points along the nerve. Using equipment largely of their own construction and design, including one of the earliest applications of a technique of electrophysiology known as the voltage clamp, they were able to record ionic currents. In 1939, they jointly published a short paper in Nature reporting on the work done in Plymouth and announcing their achievement of recording action potentials from inside a nerve fibre.[6]/nThen World War II broke out, and their research was abandoned. Huxley was recruited by the British Anti-Aircraft Command, where he worked on radar control of anti-aircraft guns. Later he was transferred to the Admiralty to do work on naval gunnery, and worked in a team led by Patrick Blackett. Hodgkin, meanwhile, was working on the development of radar at the Air Ministry. When he had a problem concerning a new type of gun sight, he contacted Huxley for advice. Huxley did a few sketches, borrowed a lathe and produced the necessary parts./nHuxley was elected to a research fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1941. In 1946, with the war ended, he was able to take this up and to resume his collaboration with Hodgkin on understanding how nerves transmit signals. Continuing their work in Plymouth, they were, within six years, able to solve the problem using equipment they built themselves. The solution was that nerve impulses, or action potentials, do not travel down the core of the fiber, but rather along the outer membrane of the fiber as cascading waves of sodium ions diffusing inward on a rising pulse and potassium ions diffusing out on a falling edge of a pulse. In 1952, they published their theory of how action potentials are transmitted in a joint paper, in which they also describe one of the earliest computational models in biochemistry.[7] This model forms the basis of most of the models used in neurobiology during the following four decades.[8]/nIn 1952, having completed work on action potentials, Huxley was teaching physiology at Cambridge and became interested in another difficult, unsolved problem: how does muscle contract? To make progress on understanding the function of muscle, new ways of observing how the network of filaments behave during contraction were needed. Prior to the war, he had been working on a preliminary design for interference microscopy, which at the time he believed to be original, though it turned out to have been tried 50 years before and abandoned. He, however, was able to make interference microscopy work and to apply it to the problem of muscle contraction with great effect. He was able to view muscle contraction with greater precision than conventional microscopes, and to distinguish types of fiber more easily. By 1953, with the assistance of Rolf Niedergerke, he began to find the features of muscle movement. Around that time, Hugh Huxley and Jean Hanson came to a similar observation. Authored in pairs, their papers were simultaneously published in the 22 May 1954 issue of Nature.[9][10] Thus the four people introduced what is called the sliding filament theory of muscle contractions.[11] Huxley synthesized his findings, and the work of colleagues, into a detailed description of muscle structure and how muscle contraction occurs and generates force that he published in 1957.[12] In 1966 his team provided the proof of the theory, and has remained the basis of modern understanding of muscle physiology.[13]/nIn 1953, Huxley worked at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, as a Lalor Scholar. He gave the Herter Lectures at Johns Hopkins Medical School in 1959 and the Jesup Lectures at Columbia University in 1964. In 1961 he lectured on neurophysiology at Kiev University as part of an exchange scheme between British and Russian professors./nHe was an editor of the Journal of Physiology from 1950 to 1957 and also of the Journal of Molecular Biology. In 1955, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and served on the Council of the Royal Society from 1960 to 1962.[14]/nHuxley held college and university posts in Cambridge until 1960, when he became head of the Department of Physiology at University College London. In addition to his administrative and teaching duties, he continued to work actively on muscle contraction, and also made theoretical contributions to other work in the department, such as that on animal reflectors.[15] In 1963, he was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his part in discoveries concerning the ionic mechanisms of the nerve cell.[4] In 1969 he was appointed to a Royal Society Research Professorship, which he held in the Department of Physiology at University College London./nIn 1980, Huxley was elected as President of the Royal Society, a post he held until 1985. In his Presidential Address in 1981, he chose to defend the Darwinian explanation of evolution, as his ancestor, T. H. Huxley had in 1860. Whereas T. H. Huxley was defying the bishops of his day, Sir Andrew was countering new theories of periods of accelerated change. In 1983, he defended the Society's decision to elect Margaret Thatcher as a fellow on the ground of her support for science even after 44 fellows had signed a letter of protest./nIn 1984, he was elected Master of Trinity, succeeding his longtime collaborator, Sir Alan Hodgkin. His appointment broke the tradition that the office of Master of Trinity alternates between a scientist and an arts man. He was Master until 1990 and was fond of reminding interviewers that Trinity College had more Nobel Prize winners than did the whole of France. He maintained up to his death his position as a fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge, teaching in physiology, natural sciences and medicine.[16] He was also a fellow of Imperial College London in 1980.[17]/nFrom his experimental work with Hodgkin, Huxley developed a set of differential equations that provided a mathematical explanation for nerve impulses\u2014the \"action potential\". This work provided the foundation for all of the current work on voltage-sensitive membrane channels, which are responsible for the functioning of animal nervous systems. Quite separately, he developed the mathematical equations for the operation of myosin \"cross-bridges\" that generate the sliding forces between actin and myosin filaments, which cause the contraction of skeletal muscles. These equations presented an entirely new paradigm for understanding muscle contraction, which has been extended to provide understanding of almost all of the movements produced by cells above the level of bacteria. Together with the Swiss physiologist Robert St\u00e4mpfli, he evidenced the existence of saltatory conduction in myelinated nerve fibres./nHuxley, Alan Hodgkin and John Eccles jointly won the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for their discoveries concerning the ionic mechanisms involved in excitation and inhibition in the peripheral and central portions of the nerve cell membrane\". Huxley and Hodgkin won the prize for experimental and mathematical work on the process of nerve action potentials, the electrical impulses that enable the activity of an organism to be coordinated by a central nervous system.[3] Eccles had made important discoveries on synaptic transmission./nHuxley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1955, and was awarded its Copley Medal in 1973 \"in recognition of his outstanding studies on the mechanisms of the nerve impulse and of activation of muscular contraction.\"[18] Huxley was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1961.[19] He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II on 12 November 1974. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1975 and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1979.[20][21] He was appointed to the Order of Merit on 11 November 1983. In 1976\u201377, he was President of the British Science Association and from 1980 to 1985 he served as President of the Royal Society. In 1986 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering then known as the Fellowship of Engineering.[22]/nHuxley's portrait by David Poole hangs in Trinity College's collection.[23]/nIn 1947, Huxley married Jocelyn \"Richenda\" Gammell (n\u00e9e Pease), the daughter of the geneticist Michael Pease (a son of Edward R.

He was awarded the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Paul Nurse and Leland H. Hartwell for their discoveries of protein molecules that control the division of cells. While studying fertilized sea urchin eggs in the early 1980s, Hunt discovered cyclin, a protein that cyclically aggregates and is depleted during cell division cycles./nHunt was born on 19 February 1943[11] in Neston, Cheshire, to Richard William Hunt, a lecturer in palaeography in Liverpool, and Kit Rowland, daughter of a timber merchant.[12] After the death of both his parents, Hunt found his father had worked at Bush House, then the headquarters of BBC World Service radio, most likely in intelligence, although it is not known what he actually did.[12] In 1945, Richard became Keeper of the Western Manuscripts at the Bodleian Library, and the family relocated to Oxford. At the age of eight, Hunt was accepted into the Dragon School,[11] where he first developed an interest in biology thanks to his German teacher, Gerd Sommerhoff.[12] When he was fourteen, he moved to Magdalen College School, Oxford, where the science prizes now bear his name, becoming even more interested in science and studying subjects such as chemistry and zoology.[12][13][14][15]/nIn 1961, he was accepted into Clare College, Cambridge to study Natural Sciences, graduating in 1964 and immediately beginning work in the university Department of Biochemistry under Asher Korner.[12] There, he worked with scientists such as Louis Reichardt and Tony Hunter.[12] A 1965 talk by Vernon Ingram interested him in haemoglobin synthesis, and at a Greek conference in 1966 on the subject, he persuaded the haematologist and geneticist Irving London to allow him to work in his laboratory at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, staying from July to October 1966.[12] His PhD was supervised by Asher Korner[5] and focused on haemoglobin synthesis in intact rabbit reticulocytes (immature red blood cells), and was awarded in 1968.[5][16][17]/nFollowing his PhD, Hunt returned to New York to work with London, in collaboration with Nechama Kosower, her husband Edward Kosower, and Ellie Ehrenfeld. While there, they discovered that tiny amounts of glutathione inhibited protein synthesis in reticulocytes and that tiny amounts of RNA killed the synthesis altogether. After returning to Cambridge, he again began work with Tony Hunter and Richard Jackson, who had discovered the RNA strand used to start haemoglobin synthesis. After 3\u20134 years, the team discovered at least two other chemicals acting as inhibitors.[12]/nHunt regularly spent summers working at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, which was popular with scientists for its advanced summer courses, and in particular, with those interested in the study of mitosis. The location provided a ready supply of surf clams and sea urchins amongst the reefs and fishing docks, and it was these invertebrates that were particularly useful for the study of the synthesis of proteins in embryogenesis, as the embryos were simply generated with the application of filtered sea water, and the transparency of the embryo cells was well suited to microscopic study.[18]/nIt was at Woods Hole in the Summer of 1982, using the sea urchin (Arbacia punctulata) egg as his model organism, that he discovered the cyclin molecule.[12] Hunt was a keen cyclist and named the protein based on his observation of the cyclical changes in its levels.[19]/nCyclins are proteins that play a key role in regulating the cell-division cycle.[20] Hunt found that cyclins begin to be synthesised after the eggs are fertilised and increase in levels during interphase, until they drop very quickly in the middle of mitosis in each cell division. He also found that cyclins are present in vertebrate cells, where they also regulate the cell cycle. He and others subsequently showed that cyclins bind and activate a family of protein kinases, now called the cyclin-dependent kinases, one of which had been identified as a crucial cell cycle regulator by Paul Nurse. The cyclin mechanism of cell division is fundamental to all living organisms (excluding bacteria) and thus the study of the process in simple organisms helps shed light on the growth of tumours in humans.[21]/nIn 1990, he began work at Imperial Cancer Research Fund, later known as the Cancer Research UK London Research Institute, in the United Kingdom, where his work focused on understanding on what makes cell go cancerous, that is: proliferate uncontrollably, with the ordinary inhibitory signals switched off.[22] Hunt had his own laboratory at the Clare Hall Laboratories until the end of 2010, and remains an Emeritus Group Leader at the Francis Crick Institute.[21][23]  He is a member of the Advisory Council for the Campaign for Science and Engineering.[24]  He has served on the Selection Committee for the Shaw Prize in Life Science and Medicine.[25] In 2010, Hunt joined the Academic Advisory Board of the Austrian think tank Academia Superior, Institute for Future Studies.[26]/nHunt is a highly regarded colleague and mentor in the research community.[27][28] During his career he has supervised numerous PhD students including Hugh Pelham[6] and Jonathon Pines.[8]/nIn addition to his scientific contributions, Hunt is a lifelong advocate for scientific research. After winning the Nobel Prize in 2001, he spent much of his time traveling the world, talking to both popular and specialist audiences. In these talks he offered his characteristic perspective on inquiry, which emphasizes the importance of having fun and being lucky.[29] He also believes that science benefits when power is given to young people.[30]/nIn June 2015, Hunt became the target of an online shaming campaign after remarks he made at a science journalism conference.[31] The controversy forced his resignation from several key research and policy positions, including the European Research Council, and a temporary withdrawal from public life and professional activities.[32]/nHunt was elected a member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) in 1978, serving as a member of the organisation's Fellowship Committee 1990\u20131993, its Meeting Committee 2008\u20132009, and its governing body, the Council, 2004\u20132009.[1] He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1991,[2] his certificate of election reads:[33]/nDistinguished for his studies of the control of protein synthesis in animal cells and for the discovery of cyclin, a protein which regulates the eukaryotic cell cycle. Together with Jackson and their students, he defined steps in formation of the initiation complex in protein synthesis, showing that the 40S ribosomal subunit binds initiator tRNA before it binds mRNA, and that this step was the target of inhibitors such as double-stranded RNA or haem deficiency. They showed that inhibition of protein synthesis is mediated by reversible phosphorylation of initiation factor eIF-2 by two distinct protein kinases and they elucidated the unexpected roles of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase in protein synthesis. With Ruderman and Rosenthal, he demonstrated selective translational control of mRNA in early clam embryos. This led to Hunt's discovery of cyclin as a protein which is selectively destroyed in mitosis. He subsequently cloned and sequenced cyclin cDNA from sea urchins and frogs and showed by elegant mRNA ablation experiments that cyclin translation is necessary for mitosis in frog embryos. He has also shown that cyclin is a subunit of the mitosis-promoting factor which regulates entry into mitosis. His discovery and characterization of cyclin are major contributions to our knowledge of cell cycle regulation in eukaryotic cells./nHunt was elected a fellow of the UK's Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) in 1998,[34] and a foreign associate of the US National Academy of Sciences in 1999.[35]/nIn 2001, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Leland Hartwell and Paul Nurse for their discoveries regarding cell cycle regulation by cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinases. The three laureates are cited \"for their discoveries of key regulators of the cell cycle,\" while Hunt in particular/nis awarded for his discovery of cyclins, proteins that regulate the CDK function. He showed that cyclins are degraded periodically at each cell division, a mechanism proved to be of general importance for cell cycle control.[36]/nIn 2003, Hunt was made an honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (HonFRSE).[3] In 2006, he was awarded the Royal Society's Royal Medal, two of which are presented annually for \"the most important contributions to the advancement of natural knowledge\", in his case for \"discovering a key aspect of cell cycle control, the protein cyclin which is a component of cyclin dependent kinases, demonstrating his ability to grasp the significance of the result outside his immediate sphere of interest\".[37]/nHunt was knighted in the 2006 Birthday Honours for his service to science.[38]/nHunt is married to the immunologist Mary Collins, who was provost of the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Japan, and is now Director of the Blizard Institute Queen Mary University of London.

He published the basic concept of natural selection as a mechanism in evolutionary adaptation and speciation in 1831 (i.e. resulting from positive natural selection, in contrast to its already, widely known, negative role in removal of individuals in the Struggle for Survival), but did not further develop or publicize his ideas. Consequently, when Charles Darwin later published On the Origin of Species in 1859, he and Alfred Russel Wallace were regarded by their scientific peers as having originated (independently of each other) the theory of evolution by natural selection; it has been suggested that Darwin and/or Wallace had encountered Matthew's earlier work, but there is no hard  evidence of this. After the publication of On the Origin of Species, Matthew contacted Darwin, who in subsequent editions of the book acknowledged that the principle of natural selection had been anticipated by Matthew's brief statement, mostly contained in the appendices and addendum of his 1831 book On Naval Timber and Arboriculture./nPatrick Matthew was born 20 October 1790 at Rome, a farm held by his father John Matthew near Scone Palace, in Perthshire.[a] His mother was Agnes Duncan, a relative of Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan.[2]\u2014Patrick Matthew took over the management of Gourdiehill Estate and began in earnest to plant his orchards that would eventually grow to over 10,000 apple and pear trees and would become some of the finest in the entire British Empire. In 1807, Matthew inherited Gourdiehill from Adam Duncan. Admiral Duncan inherited Gourdiehill, Auchmuir and Seaside estates upon the death of his older brother Alexander, who had previously inherited these 3 estates from his parents near the small village of Errol./nMatthew was educated at Perth Academy and the University of Edinburgh, but did not graduate due to the death of his father. Matthew had to take over the responsibilities of managing and running the affairs of a property estate at Gourdiehill. Over the years he successfully nurtured, cultivated, and transformed much of the estate's farmland and pastures into several large orchards of apple and pear trees, numbering over 10,000.[citation needed]  During this time, Matthew became an avid researcher of both silviculture and horticulture. His research and experience at the modest estate framed a strong base of reference to form his own opinions and theories.[3]/nMatthew periodically traveled to Europe between 1807 and 1831 either on business or for his scientific studies.[citation needed] A trip to Paris in 1815 had to be cut short when Napoleon returned from Elba.[citation needed] Between 1840 and 1850, Matthew traveled extensively in what is now northern Germany. Recognizing the commercial potential of Hamburg, he bought two farms in Schleswig-Holstein.[3]/nMatthew married his maternal first cousin, Christian Nicol in 1817,[3] and they had eight children: John (born 1818), Robert (1820), Alexander (1821), Charles (1824), Euphemia (1826), Agnes (1828), James Edward (1830), and Helen Amelia (1833). Robert farmed Gourdiehill in Patrick's old age, Alexander took over the German interests; the other three sons emigrated, initially to the United States.[citation needed] Matthew became interested in the colonization of New Zealand and was instrumental in setting up a \"Scottish New Zealand Land Company\".[citation needed] At his urging, James and Charles Matthew emigrated to New Zealand, where they set up one of the earliest commercial orchards in Australasia using seed and seedlings from Gourdiehill.[4] John Matthew remained in America, sending botanical tree specimens back to his father; these included the first seedlings known to have been planted in Europe of both the Giant Redwood and the Coastal Redwood. A group of trees of these species still thriving near Inchture in Perthshire comes from these seedlings.[citation needed] Matthew gave many more seedlings to friends, relatives and neighbors, and redwoods can be found throughout the Carse of Gowrie; these as well as some elsewhere in Scotland (e.g. at Gillies Hill near Stirling Castle) are thought to have been grown from the seedlings.[citation needed] His reputation as a local celebrity faded in the twentieth century, when he was remembered as a \"character\"[by whom?] who at the end of his life became convinced that \"someone very dear to his heart\" had become a bird, and \"that was the rizzen he wouldna allow the blackies to be shot in his orchard for fear they would shute her, ye ken, although the blackies were sair on the fruit\".[2]/nMatthew's house, Gourdiehill, fell into disrepair in the 1970s and 1980s, and was demolished in 1990 when the grounds became a small housing estate; some of the salvaged stone was incorporated in a rock garden.[5]/nIn managing his orchards, Patrick Matthew became familiar with the problems related to the principles of husbandry in horticulture for food production (and hence, by extension silviculture). In 1831, Matthew published On Naval Timber and Arboriculture to mixed reception.[6][7][8][9][10] Notably, the book contains an addendum that discusses natural selection 28 years before Charles Darwin's publication of On the Origin of Species./nIn 1860, Matthew read in the Gardeners' Chronicle for 3 March a review (by Huxley[11]), republished from The Times, of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, which said Darwin \"professes to have discovered the existence and the modus operandi of natural selection, and described its principles\". A letter by Matthew, published in the Gardeners' Chronicle on 7 April 1860, said that this was what he had \"published very fully and brought to apply practically to forestry\" in Naval Timber and Arboriculture in 1831, as publicised in reviews. He quoted extracts from his book, firstly the opening words of Note B from pages 364\u2013365 of the Appendix, stopping before his discussion of hereditary nobility and entail.[12]/nHe then quoted in its entirety a section from pages 381 to 388 of the Appendix.[13] This lacked a heading, but in the Contents appeared as \"Accommodation of organized life to circumstance, by diverging ramifications\".[14] In it, he commented on the difficulty of distinguishing \"between species and variety\". The change of the fossil record between geological eras implied living organisms having \"a power of change, under a change of circumstances\", in the same way as the \"derangements and changes in organised existence, induced by a change of circumstance from the interference of man\" gave \"proof of the plastic quality of superior life\" which he called \"a circumstance-suiting power\". Following past deluges, \"an unoccupied field would be formed for new diverging ramifications of life\" in \"the course of time, moulding and accommodating their being anew to the change of circumstances\". He proposed that \"the progeny of the same parents, under great difference of circumstance, might, in several generations, even become distinct species, incapable of co-reproduction.\"[12]/nThe self-regulating adaptive disposition of organised life, may, in part, be traced to the extreme fecundity of Nature, who, as before stated, has, in all the varieties of her offspring, a prolific power much beyond (in many cases a thousandfold) what is necessary to fill up the vacancies caused by senile decay. As the field of existence is limited and pre-occupied, it is only the hardier, more robust, better suited to circumstance individuals, who are able to struggle forward to maturity, these inhabiting only the situations to which they have superior adaptation and greater power of occupancy than any other kind; the weaker, less circumstance-suited, being prematurely destroyed.[12]/nHe described this as a \"circumstance-adaptive law, operating upon the slight but continued natural disposition to sport in the progeny\". Matthew then quoted the opening three paragraphs from Part III of his book, Miscellaneous Matter Connected with Naval Timber: Nurseries, pages 106 to 108, on \"the luxuriance and size of timber depending upon the particular variety of the species\" and the need to select seed from the best individuals when growing trees.[12][15]/nOn reading this, Darwin commented in a letter to Charles Lyell dated 10 April:/nNow for a curious thing about my Book, & then I have done. In last Saturday Gardeners' Chronicle, a Mr Patrick Matthews [sic] publishes long extract from his work on Naval Timber & Arboriculture published in 1831, in which he briefly but completely anticipates the theory of Nat. Selection. I have ordered the Book, as some few passages are rather obscure but it, is certainly, I think, a complete but not developed anticipation! Erasmus always said that surely this would be shown to be the case someday. Anyhow one may be excused in not having discovered the fact in a work on Naval Timber.[16]/nDarwin then wrote a letter of his own to the Gardener's Chronicle, stating,/nI have been much interested by Mr. Patrick Matthew's communication in the Number of your Paper, dated April 7th. I freely acknowledge that Mr. Matthew has anticipated by many years the explanation which I have offered of the origin of species, under the name of natural selection. I think that no one will feel surprised that neither I, nor apparently any other naturalist, had heard of Mr. Matthew's views, considering how briefly they are given, and that they appeared in the appendix to a work on Naval Timber and Arboriculture. I can do no more than offer my apologies to Mr. Matthew for my entire ignorance of his publication. If another edition of my work is called for, I will insert a notice to the foregoing effect.[17]/nAs promised, Darwin included a statement in the third (1861) and subsequent editions of On the Origin of Species, acknowledging that Matthew had anticipated \"precisely the same view on the origin of species\" and \"clearly saw...the full force of the principle of natural selection\". The statement referred to the correspondence, and quoted from a response by Matthew published in the Gardener's Chronicle. Darwin wrote that./nUnfortunately the view was given by Mr. Matthew very briefly in scattered passages in an Appendix to a work on a different subject, so that it remained unnoticed until Mr. Matthew himself drew attention to it in the 'Gardener's Chronicle,' on April 7th, 1860. The differences of Mr. Matthew's view from mine are not of much importance: he seems to consider that the world was nearly depopulated at successive periods, and then re-stocked; and he gives, as an alternative, that new forms may be generated without the presence of any mould or germ of former aggregates. I am not sure that I understand some passages; but it seems that he attributes much influence to the direct action of the conditions of life. He clearly saw, however, the full force of the principle of natural selection. In answer to a letter of mine (published in Gard. Chron., April 13th), fully acknowledging that Mr. Matthew had anticipated me, he with generous candour wrote a letter (Gard. Chron. May 12th) containing the following passage:\u2014\"To me the conception of this law of Nature came intuitively as a self-evident fact, almost without an effort of concentrated thought. Mr. Darwin here seems to have more merit in the discovery than I have had; to me it did not appear a discovery. He seems to have worked it out by inductive reason, slowly and with due caution to have made his way synthetically from fact to fact onwards; while with me it was by a general glance at the scheme of Nature that I estimated this select production of species as an \u00e0 priori recognisable fact\u2014an axiom requiring only to be pointed out to be admitted by unprejudiced minds of sufficient grasp.\"[18]/nIn June 1864, after visiting his son who was farming in Schleswig-Holstein, Matthew wrote to Darwin about his pamphlet publishing five of his letters.[19] The title page of this political pamphlet by Matthew stated his claim to be \"solver of the problem of species\".[20] In a letter to Hooker (22 and 28 October 1865), Darwin commented that William Charles Wells, in an essay \"read in 1813 to Royal Soc. but not printed\", had applied \"most distinctly the principle of N. Selection to the races of man.\u2014 So poor old Patrick Matthew, is not the first, & he cannot or ought not any longer put on his Title pages 'Discoverer of the principle of Natural Selection'!.\"[21]/nMatthew, Darwin and Wallace are the only three people considered to have independently discovered the principle of natural selection as a mechanism for speciation (macroevolution).  Others prior to Matthew had proposed natural selection as a mechanism for the generation of varieties or races within a species: James Hutton suggested the mechanism in 1794 as leading to improvement of varieties, and an 1813 paper by William Charles Wells proposed that it would form new varieties. In 1835, after Matthew's book, Edward Blyth published a description of the process as a mechanism preserving the unchanging essence of stable species.[22]/nStephen Jay Gould described American anthropologist Loren Eiseley's research on pre-Darwinian theory in his piece on Natural Selection as a Creative Force,[23]/nThe following kind of incident has occurred over and over again, ever since Darwin. An evolutionist, browsing through some pre-Darwinian tome in natural history, comes upon a description of natural selection. Aha, he says; I have found something important, a proof that Darwin wasn't original. Perhaps I have even discovered a source of direct and nefarious pilfering by Darwin! In the most notorious of these claims, the great anthropologist and writer Loren Eiseley thought that he had detected such an anticipation in the writings of Edward Blyth. Eiseley laboriously worked through the evidence that Darwin had read (and used) Blyth's work and, making a crucial etymological mistake along the way, finally charged that Darwin may have pinched the central idea for his theory from Blyth. He published his case in a long article (Eiseley, 1959), later expanded by his executors into a posthumous volume entitled \"Darwin and the Mysterious Mr. X\" (1979)./nThe rebuttals of these claims tend to require an large investment of effort, sometimes only concluding after years of counterarguments (e.g., Roy Davies' The Darwin Conspiracy: Origins of a Scientific Crime)./nAlthough Darwin insisted he had been unaware of Matthew's work, some modern commentators have held that he and Wallace were likely to have known of it, or could have been influenced indirectly by other naturalists who read and cited Matthew's book./nHowever, there is no direct evidence that Darwin had read the book, and his letter to Charles Lyell stating that he had ordered the book clearly indicates that he did not have a copy in his extensive library or access to it elsewhere. The particular claim that Robert Chambers had read and transmitted Matthew's ideas that are relevant to natural selection is also not supported by the facts. The article in the Chambers's Edinburgh Journal (1832, vol. 1, no. 8, 24 March, p.\u00a063) is not a review but only an abridged excerpt from pp.\u00a08\u201314 of On Naval Timber that amounts to no more than a recipe for pruning and contains nothing of relevance to natural selection. It is headed \"ON THE TRAINING OF PLANK TIMBER\" and ends with \".\u2014 Matthew on Naval Timber.\"[35] Even if it had been penned by Robert Chambers, this does not mean that he had read or understood, leave alone transmitted, the other passages of Matthew's book that do contain anything relevant to natural selection. Further, The Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation contain nothing of relevance about natural selection. Combining these facts, Robert Chambers had probably not read or received the message about natural selection in Matthew's book, likely did not promulgate it in the Vestiges, and probably neither in conversations./nChallenges to Matthew's claim to priority, or those made since he died, have essentially made reference to the same issues, that his description of natural selection was not accessible and it lacked lengthier development. Other criticisms have focussed on the differences between Darwin's and Matthew's versions of natural selection, and sometimes Wallace's too (e.g., Weale 2015). If Matthew's ideas had made the impact on subsequent evolutionary thinking, as claimed, the signals ought to be there, either during Matthew's lifetime, or Darwin's. Yet, modern claims for Matthew's priority have been unable to provide evidence for this, that has withstood fact checking./nHistorian of science, Peter Bowler succinctly summarised some of those main reasons given for why Matthew does not deserve priority for natural selection over Darwin and Wallace,/nSuch efforts to denigrate Darwin misunderstand the whole point of the history of science: Matthew did suggest a basic idea of selection, but he did nothing to develop it; and he published it in the appendix to a book on the raising of trees for shipbuilding. No one took him seriously, and he played no role in the emergence of Darwinism. Simple priority is not enough to earn a thinker a place in the history of science: one has to develop the idea and convince others of its value to make a real contribution. Darwin's notebooks confirm that he drew no inspiration from Matthew or any of the other alleged precursors.[36]/nErnst Mayr's opinion was even more clear-cut:/nPatrick Matthew undoubtedly had the right idea, just like Darwin did on September 28, 1838, but he did not devote the next twenty years to converting it into a cogent theory of evolution. As a result it had no impact whatsoever.[37]/nRichard Dawkins also grants that Matthew had grasped the general concept of natural selection, but failed to appreciate the significance, nor develop it further,/nI agree with W.J. Dempster, Patrick Matthew's modern champion, that Matthew has been unkindly treated by history. 'But, unlike Dempster, I hesitate to assign full priority to him. Partly, it is because he wrote in a much more obscure style than either Darwin or Wallace, which makes it hard to know in some places what he was trying to say (Darwin himself noted this). But mostly it is because he seems to have underestimated the idea, to an extent where we have to doubt whether he really understood how important it was. The same could be said, even more strongly (which is why I have not treated his case in the same detail as Matthew's), of W.C. Wells, whom Darwin also scrupulously acknowledged (in the fourth and subsequent editions of The Origin). Wells made the leap to generalise from artificial to natural selection, but he applied it only to humans, and he thought of it as choosing among races of people rather than individuals as Darwin and Wallace did. Wells therefore seems to have arrived at a form of 'group selection' rather than true, Darwinian natural selection as Matthew did, which selects individual organisms for their reproductive success. Darwin also lists other partial predecessors, who had shadowy inklings of natural selection. Like Patrick Matthew, none of them seems to have grasped the earth-shattering significance of the idea they had lit upon, and I shall use Matthew's name to represent them all. I am increasingly inclined to agree with Matthew that natural selection itself scarcely needed discovering. What needed discovering was the significance of natural selection for the evolution of all life.[38]/nIn response to Sutton's  e-book, Darwin biographer James Moore said many people came towards a similar perception during the 19th century, but Darwin was the only one who fully developed the idea:/nPatrick Matthew has always struck me as a non-issue. Many people understood the issue of natural selection but it was only Darwin who applied it to everything on the planet, as an entire vision of life. That was his legacy. I would be extremely surprised if there was any new evidence had not been already seen and interpreted in the opposite way.[29]/nIn response to Sutton (2015)[33] Darwin and Wallace scholar, John van Wyhe commented,/nThis conspiracy theory is so silly and based on such forced and contorted imitations of historical method that no qualified historian could take it seriously.[39]/nTo coincide with Sutton's presentation to the Carse of Gowrie Sustainability Group, Darwin author, Julian F. Derry sent an open letter, saying,/ncontrary to what Dr Sutton has told you tonight, Patrick Matthew did not influence the course of evolutionary history in the way that is claimed [. \u2026] Dr Sutton is not the myth-buster that he calls himself [and,] has been either, wrong, inaccurate or irrelevant in his conclusions [. \u2026]  Darwin and Wallace were the first to propose adaptive changes via incremental gradualism producing species better suited to their environment, making natural selection sufficiently novel in this sense [. \u2026] The title of Darwin's book could have been inspired by several sources[, \u2026] Chambers likely never saw Matthew's book[, \u2026 and, t]his is how the history will remain, despite Dr Sutton's efforts to have it modified[40]/nThe History of Science website Natural Histories has compiled a comprehensive series of blog posts on Patrick Matthew[41] that have made a close study of his writings, while importantly ensuring an appropriate historical context. The resulting pieces of evidence largely contradict Sutton's claims. This is especially so from a biological context, one that compares and evaluates core differences between Matthew's and Darwin's concepts,[42] especially that relating to relative adaptation (Matthew's power of occupancy), and diversification as an adaptive process (Darwin's principle of divergence),/nIn conclusion, Matthew's theory of evolution is a chimera pairing the old doctrine that natural selection (usually) keeps the species fixed with the catastrophism that allowed for rapid transformation and radiation of species by natural selection after a catastrophe. Darwin's principle of divergence, however, was his final break away from the doctrine that natural selection kept species fixed. The principle of divergence differs from Matthew's ideas in its development (from Darwin's own studies of systematics and an analogy with economics), its causal structure and its consequences. This constitutes a negative paternity test for Matthew. It exculpates Darwin from claims of plagiarising Matthew for the time after he shifted from his early (1844) to his mature theory (1856-58). His early theory, without the principle of divergence, was equally different from Matthew's ideas:/nThis exculpates Darwin for the time from his return from the Beagle voyage till 1844. Hence, the period for which there is no evidence that Matthew's ideas are present in Darwin's work, the records of his development of ideas, and expression of those concepts in his writing can be shown to extend from the time he was leaving for the Beagle voyage, up until the coalescence of his ideas into his cohesive system of evolution by natural selection in 1858. Niles Eldredge, points out the very valid point that seeing Matthew's descriptions at any point during that extended period, would likely have resulted in an integral, preformed model being described by Darwin from the outset, whereas what we actually have in his notes is realisation of the full picture from development of incremental sketches,/nAnd though some have suggested that Darwin, in particular, had actually co-opted Matthew's ideas, it seems to me highly improbable. Recall that Darwin knew that adaptation must be explained, and that there is in fact a causal explanation for adaption that must involve 'generation' (including heredity) as well as heritable variation, as early as Notebook B in late 1837. It took him another year or so to find Malthus and the geometric growth of populations that supplied the third, until-then missing component of a complete theory of selection articulated in Notebooks D and E. Had Darwin read Matthew, he would have seen the whole thing - all three components of natural selection - in one concise statement.[43]/nSutton's claim that Darwin and Wallace plagiarised evolution by natural selection from Matthew also has been refuted by Joachim Dagg,[44]/nThe perspective emerging from this comparison shows at least four unique theories (Matthew, early Darwin, mature Darwin and Wallace), each interesting in its own right. Each theory integrated change in conditions, variability, competition and natural selection in ways that allowed for species transformation somehow. Apart from this similarity, the theories differ significantly from each other in the mechanisms underlying transformation. However, this difference does not lie in the struggle for survival and survival of the fittest, but in the way in which natural selection is integrated with variability, competition and environmental conditions. Transmutation is a convergent result of structurally different mechanisms./nAccepting these irreconcilable differences in theory, a remaining route has been proposed, by which Darwin may have got to gain knowledge of Matthew's evolutionary ideas, that is, by knowledge being passed along a network of associates, by word of mouth, or an equally indirect pathway, such as via the influence of an editor.[30] Evidence that such a network existed could be found if there was documentation of anyone having discussed Matthew's ideas on evolution. However, there is no single contemporary record of anyone having even recognised any value in Matthew's concept. Of the three sources to mention the existence of evolutionary content in On Naval Timber,[45] two were rejections./nMatthew, however, in his able treatise on naval timber seems to think that its indigenous location in such districts arises not so much from preference of soils of the nature above-mentioned, as from its having more power of occupancy in such soils than any other plant of the country; and this opinion he endeavours to support by stating that the Pinus sylvestris, planted in a good or rich soil, attains larger dimensions and its best timber properties, and that it is only driven from this superior soil by the greater power of occupancy possessed by the oak and other deciduous trees, an opinion in which we cannot altogether acquiesce, as we see no reason why the fir, if it grows with such additional vigour in a richer soil, as Mr. Matthew asserts, should, at the same time, be unable to maintain a contest with the oak or other tree.[46]/nwe disclaim participation in his rumination on the law of Nature, or on the outrages committed upon reason and justice by our burthens of hereditary nobility, entailed property, and insane enactments[47]/nOne of the subjects discussed in this appendix is the puzzling one, of the origin of species and varieties; and if the author has hereon originated no original views (and of this we are far from certain), he has certainly exhibited his own in an original manner[48]/nWhile completing a doctoral thesis on Disputes of Plagiarism in Darwin's Theory of Evolution at the University of Zielona Gora, where the journal Filozoficzne Aspekty Genezy (F.A.G.) (Philosophical Aspects of Genesis) is based, Grzegorz Malec published a critical review of Sutton (2015), in which the main difficulty of valid identification of communication pathways was discussed, along with observations on Sutton's alternative approach,/nIf Sutton is right and Darwin was a plagiarist, it will be the most shocking discovery in the history of science. But he must present hard evidence to convince anyone that Darwin read Matthew's book before 1859 and had known those fragments concerning natural selection. Eventually, he should prove that Darwin learned about Matthew's idea from one of his friends or correspondences [\u2026] Sutton's line of reasoning can be reduced to one simple pattern: since Wilkin could read Matthew, then he must have done so, and because he could have discussed his evolutionary views with Joseph Hooker (1817-1911), then he did, and since Hooker could have informed Darwin about Matthew's book, then he did. But all of this is inferred by Sutton without offering any hard evidence that this really happened. Similar situation concerns Mudie, Main, Conrad, Roget, Johnson, Selby, Emmons, Laycock, Powell and Leidy [\u2026]  It seems that Darwin's acknowledgement to Matthew in his letter to The Gardeners' Chronicle, and putting the latter's name in the list of predecessors in the historical sketch in On the Origin of Species, was fair enough.[49]/nNatural Histories analysed the set of pathways that Sutton claims could have conveyed information on evolution from Matthew to Darwin and Wallace,[50] also noting the same arbitrary determinism detected by Malec (above), they explain that,/nSutton [\u2026] has used google, in order to track down the provenience of certain quotes that are often attributed wrongly. He now thinks he has sufficient evidence to conclude that both Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace plagiarized Patrick Matthew (1831. On Naval Timber and Arboriculture) and stole Matthew's idea of evolution through natural selection from it. One part of his exercise [\u2026] was to find phrases in Matthew (1831) that were apparently never used before. Concluding that Matthew was first to coin and use these phrases (called Matthewisms), authors who used the same phrase afterwards were taken to have them from Matthew (1831). These authors were called first to be second [\u2026] the implication being that they all read Matthew's book and, if they didn't cite Matthew, betray this by the use of the phrases in question [\u2026] Let me summarize [\u2026]:/nWriting to Darwin in 1871, Matthew enclosed an article he had written for The Scotsman and, as well as wishing that he had time to write a critique of The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, expressed the belief that there is evidence of design and benevolence in nature, and that beauty cannot be accounted for by natural selection.[69] Such a belief is mainstream natural theology, and reveals how far Matthew was from Darwin in realising the potential of evolutionary explanations: for him as well as others, man was the sticking-point./nThere is little or no evidence that Matthew held these views as a younger man: there is no discussion of a religious nature in Arboriculture./nMatthew's idea on society were radical for their times. Although he was a landowner, he was involved with the Chartist movement, and argued that institutions of hereditary nobility were detrimental to society. It has been suggested that these views worked against acceptance of his theory of natural selection, being politically incorrect at the time (see Barker, 2001). The more likely reason is that the obscurity of the location hid the ideas from many who would have been interested. Only after Darwin's Origin did Matthew come forward in a popular journal, the Gardeners' Chronicle. Matthew also published a book in 1839, Emigration Fields (Black, Edinburgh), suggesting that overpopulation, as predicted by Malthus, could be solved by mass migration to North America and the Dominions./nMatthew supported the invasion of Schleswig-Holstein by Bismarck in 1864: his pamphlet on the event was denounced by the Dundee Advertiser. He also supported the Germans against the French in the Franco-Prussian War (1870\u201371), a war which marked the final unification of the German Empire and the end of the Second French Empire./nIn 1870 Matthew became aware of the terrible housing conditions of the workers in Dundee. In a letter to the Dundee Advertiser he told readers that the death rate of children under five in the town was 40%, and outlined a blueprint for the redevelopment of the city./nWhen the Edinburgh and Northern Railway (E&N) and the Dundee and Perth Railway (D&P) were seeking Parliamentary approval in 1845, it was proposed by their engineers that from Perth both should share a line running along the south bank of the Tay as far as Newburgh, where the D&P would cross to the north bank, and the E&N leave the Tay and head south to a ferry crossing of the Forth.  Matthew had been in a very small minority supporting this, and the D&P as built crossed the Tay at Perth. In 1864, when a bridge crossing the Tay at Dundee was proposed, Matthew urged that a bridge at Newburgh was preferable to a bridge at Dundee, a Newburgh bridge giving much the same reduction in the rail distance between Dundee and the Forth ferry-ports from which passengers could cross to Edinburgh as a bridge at Dundee but doing so by a shorter (and therefore cheaper) crossing of the Tay.[70]  He argued the costs of a Dundee bridge were being grossly under-estimated: \"To erect a substantial bridge, not a flimsy spectral thing, which might or not vanish as a phantom the first storm, or break down under the vibration caused by a heavy, rapid, moving train, would, in my opinion cost nearly double, and probably much more than double, the sum the Engineer states; upon this I stake my judgement against that of the Engineer\", noting in passing, \"from the geological indices, I would expect the foundation to be more regular at Newburgh than at Dundee, consequently better\".[70]/nThe financial crisis of 1866 put an end to the 1864 Tay Bridge proposal, but it was revived in 1869.  Matthew responded with a series of letters to the Dundee papers arguing for a Newburgh bridge, and advancing all manner of additional arguments against a Dundee bridge; it would have a deleterious effect on silting and tidal scour in the Firth;[71] it would prevent navigation upstream of it;[72] it would be torn apart by the centrifugal force from heavy trains rapidly descending the curve at its northern end; it was vulnerable to earthquake, a ship colliding with a pier, or to high wind.[73]/nMatthew's objections were not heeded,[74] and were not persisted in once Parliament had passed the Bill authorising construction of the Tay Bridge.  During construction of the bridge some of Matthew's criticisms were borne out: it became apparent that bedrock could not be found at a depth allowing the use of brick piers; the design had to be modified to use lattice-work iron piers of reduced width, and there was considerable cost overrun. The  bridge opened in June 1878 and was destroyed in a storm in December 1879: the lattice work piers supporting the centre section of the bridge (the high girders) failed catastrophically as a train was crossing the bridge.  The high girders and the train fell into the Tay and about seventy-five lives were lost. Whilst it was recalled in the immediate aftermath of the disaster that Matthew had predicted collapse in a high wind as one of the horrible ends to which a bridge at Dundee could come,[75] the disaster is generally ascribed to defects in the design and manufacture of the lattice work piers introduced into the design well after Matthew's campaign against the bridge./nNotes/nCitations", "61716983": "Tracy Bale is an American neuroscientist and molecular biologist.

He used the botanic garden to demonstrate live plants, but to teach plant ecology he needed students to get out in nature. The action radius from Copenhagen offered by trips by foot was far too small, however. He applied to the government and obtained a grant to take students on longer excursions every year from 1893; every third year these went to western Jutland, once to Bornholm, otherwise to Zealand. His excursion notes were published and are instructive introductions to the environment and plant adaptation in dunes, salt marshes and other habitats:/nHis early experience with vegetation in a tropical region was decisive for his future work. His collections from Lagoa Santa, 2600 plant species, of which some 370 turned out to be new to science,[1] were treated in a monumental 40-volume and 1400-page work, Symbol\u00e6 ad Floram Brasili\u00e6 centralis cognoscendam.

University of S\u00e3o Paulo./nEarly on in Warming's scientific career, the morphological-organogenetic point of was the leading principle in botanical research, and he soon became one of the most prominent workers in this branch of botany. His main works from the early period are his thesis on floral development in Euphorbia and on seed plant ovules./nWarming's doctoral thesis (in Danish) dealt with ontogeny of the cyathia of Euphorbia (Euphorbiaceae)./nPart of the work was published in German the year before the thesis:/nHis studies of pollen and anther formation i Angiosperms and on the inflorescence of Asteraceae were published in von Hanstein's Botanische Abhandlungen:/nHis studies on seed plant ovules were published in French as/nAll these works a still cited in scientific papers by scholars of botany every now and then.[19]/nThrough the 1870s, Warming became much-influenced by Darwinism. The scope of his research changed. First towards understanding ontogenesis in the light of a common descent as seen in De l\u2019Ovule, later towards plant adaptation to environmental conditions. Again, his unparalleled ability to observe plants paired with his tropical experiencewas decisive to the route he chose./nAlthough Warming did not coin the term life-form until 1895 (in Plantesamfund Ch. 2), he commenced work on plant life-form already during his Stockholm years. In the paper/nhe presented a classification based on longevity of the plant, power of vegetative propagation, duration of tillers, hypogeous or epigeous type of shoots, mode of wintering, and degree and mode of branching of rhizomes. The observation were made while raising wild plants from seed under garden conditions. In the late 1880s, after Warming's return to Copenhagen, he swopped research topic with his student Christen Raunki\u00e6r, who had traveled along the North Sea coast from Jutland to  the Netherlands and published on the phytogeography of coastal vegetation.[20] Warming now worked on plant adaptations in dunes and salt marshes, while Raunki\u00e6r studied the morphology of Danish plants, eventually leading him to his plant life-form scheme.[21] Nevertheless, after Raunki\u00e6r had published his life-form scheme, Warming return to this topic in the work/nWarming's new scheme was less simple than Raunki\u00e6r's, taking other environmental factors than wintering into account, especially water/drought stress. Warming did not approve of what he saw as over-simplification in the Raunki\u00e6r scheme.\nWarmings last published work was a renewed attempt to put all plant (including bacteria and algae) life forms into a system./nWarmings published a number of treatises based on his expedition to Southwest Greenland in 1884. One of the most important ones is his observations of the vegetation of Greenland and the history of the flora:/nWarming's collections of leaves, stems and flowers, made during the brief expedition, were examined in detail and the anatomy of a number of species described in a series of papers in Danish. Later, Warming distributed the material family-wise, now ameliorated with collectections made later expeditions and elsewhere in the Arctic, to students, who made further investigations and published the results in English:\nWarming, E. ed. (1908\u20131921) The structure and biology of Arctic flowering plants. Meddelelser om Gr\u00f8nland vol. 36: 1-481 and 37: 1\u2013507./nIt was Eugenius Warming's Lehrbuch der \u00f6kologischen Pflanzengeographie that must be considered as the starting point of self-conscious ecology. This book was the first to use physiological relations between plants and their environment, and in addition biotic interactions to explain the moulding of the assemblages that plant geographers had described and classified, and it would set up a research agenda for decades to come.[22]/nDespite the language barrier, Warming's influence on the development of ecology is remarkable, not the least in Britain and the USA. The British ecologist Arthur Tansley was extremely influenced by reading \u2019Plantesamfund\u2019 (or rather the 1896 German edition). Reading the book made him jump from anatomy to ecology.[1] Tansley used the book as textbook in a university course as early as 1899.[23][24] Similarly, Warming's book was decisive in forming the careers of North American naturalists like Henry Chandler Cowles.[25] Cowles' now classic studies of Lake Michigan sand dune plant communities were directly inspired by Warming's studies of Danish dunes.[26] Also Frederic Clements was much inspired by Warming when starting to working with succession, but more by Oscar Drude in formulating his concept of vegetational climax in his 1916 book.[citation needed]/nA more unexpected avenue of influence went through the American sociologist Robert E. Park, who read Warming's Oecology of Plants and used the ideas of ecological succession as inspiration for a notion of succession in human communities \u2013 a human ecology.[27]/nWarming's influence on later Scandinavian ecology was immense.[opinion] Especially significant was his inspiration to Christen Raunki\u00e6r \u2013 his pupil and successor on the chair of botany at the University of Copenhagen.[citation needed] In addition, he had a direct influence on Danish research, scientific and other, for a couple of decades. After his appointment to the professorship in Copenhagen, he gradually took over Japetus Steenstrups power base, most notably as one of three members of the board of the Carlsberg Foundation for 32 years. Thus, Warming had the upper hand in who should be granted money and who should not./nWarming was a firm believer in adaptation. However, he was a declared Lamarckist. In his popularizing book Nedstamningsl\u00e6ren (The theory of descendence; 1915),[28] he reviewed the direct and indirect evidence for common descent of living organisms and for Darwinian natural selection as a process involved in speciation. His keen observations of how differently the same plant is grown under different circumstances (now known as phenotypic plasticity) led him to question the change of species by infinitesimally small steps as advocated by his contemporary Darwinists of the Biometry school, e.g. Karl Pearson. Warming summarized his view on the ways in which new species could may arise:/nWarming was raised in a Christian Protestant home and he continued to be religious throughout his life. He accepted the evolution by descent of living beings, but believed that laws governing planets\u2019 orbits and other laws governing organic evolution were God-given. In his popular book Nedstamningsl\u00e6ren (translated title: Evolution by descent), he concludes the section on hypotheses about the origin of life writing that, no matter what hypothesis is considered, it just \u201cdefers the grand question: how did life first come into existence, \u00bbin the beginning\u00ab? ... as if we human beings thereby obtained understanding and explanation for anything at all, or circumvented the almighty power that, incomprehensibly to our mind, must have created matter, force, time and infinite space. Science has not disproven the Bible that says:\u00a0\u00bbIn the beginning God created \u2026\u00ab!\u201d.[28] Warming shared this view with many prominent contemporary naturalists, e.g. Alfred Russel Wallace.[29]/nPolitically, Warming was national-conservative, Scandinavist and anti-Prussian. Warming was able to visit his birthplace only a few times in his life because Schleswig was conquered by Prussia and Austria in 1864 and (Northern Schleswig) returned to Denmark in 1920. Warming expressed support, in letters,[4] for France in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War. He made financial contributions to a secret fund that should support Danish-minded Schleswigian farmers in buying farms and prevent Germanization of Northern Schleswig. In a letter of 1898 to his son Jens, he regrets that the H\u00f8jre \u2013 the conservative party \u2013 would lose an upcoming election and expresses concern that anarchy and socialism will eventually rule.[30]/nThe Orchid genus Warmingia Rchb.f. and dozens of vascular plant species (IPN])[31] has been named to his honour. The same is the case for a number of fungi, e.g. the smut fungus Microbotryum warmingii (Rostr.) V\u00e1nky and the gall fungus Arcticomyces warmingii (Rostr.) Savile.

Instead she was inspired by a Stanford lecture of Paul Ehrlich's about overpopulation. His lecture reminded her of something a Harvard professor, Irven DeVore, had said about a species of Indian monkey called langurs among whom males, supposedly because they were crowded, killed infants.[8][1]/nHrdy changed course in mid-year and entered Harvard as a graduate student in 1970 to study primate behavior so she could go to India and find out why these male Hanuman langurs were killing infants. She worked under the supervision of anthropology professor Irven DeVore and evolutionary biologist Robert L. Trivers and E. O. Wilson earning a Ph.D. in Anthropology in 1975.[1]/nSarah Blaffer met Daniel Hrdy at Harvard.

Between 1974 and 1984, she taught for brief periods at University of Massachusetts, Boston; Harvard and Rice University, and worked as a volunteer at her daughter's daycare center until 1984 when she joined the University of California at Davis as a professor of anthropology.[8][12] Hrdy retired in 1996, becoming a professor emerita of anthropology at UC Davis, where she continues to be involved with the Animal Behavior Graduate Group.[14][15]/nSarah Hrdy first heard of langurs during an undergraduate primate behavior class taught by anthropologist Irven DeVore in 1968. DeVore commented on the relationship between crowding and the killing of infants in langur colonies. After graduation, Hrdy returned to Harvard for graduate studies, with the goal of better understanding the phenomenon of infanticide in primates.[1] Working under the supervision of DeVore, Trivers and Wilson provided Hrdy with an introduction to the emerging science of sociobiology\u2014which crystallized at Harvard in the early 1970s.  Sociobiology's comparative evolutionary perspective would shape Hrdy's work for years to come.[1][16]/nAlthough Hrdy had initially gone to Mount Abu to explore the hypothesis that crowding was responsible for infanticide, soon she realized her starting hypothesis was wrong.  Infants were only attacked when males entered the breeding system from outside it.  This led her to what she termed the sexual selection hypothesis for explaining infanticide.  Males are eliminating unweaned infants sired by rival males and in doing so inducing the mother to resume cycling and ovulate again sooner than had she continued to lactate. Turnover in her langur troops occurred roughly on average every 27 months leaving the usurping male only a brief window of opportunity to breed and pass on his genes. If the females are nursing infants, it is likely that they will not ovulate for another year. Killing their dependent infants rendered females fertile again sooner than they otherwise would be.[1][17][18]/nFemale choice is subverted, as females are put under pressure to ovulate and are forced to breed with the infanticidal males. This is where the idea of sexual counter-strategies comes into play. Hrdy hypothesized that by mating with a male who might take over her troupe ahead of time, they protect their infants subsequently born since males were unlikely to kill an infant if there was a chance that it might be their own, a behavior that would be rapidly selected against.[11][18]/nWhile infanticide by males has since been reported across the primate order in prosimians, New and Old World monkeys, and ape, Hrdy found no evidence to suggest a 'genetic imperative' for infanticide in humans.[19][11][18]/nIn 1975, Hrdy was awarded her PhD for her research on langurs. In 1977 it was published in her second book, The Langurs of Abu: Female and Male Strategies of Reproduction.[1][19] However her proposal that infanticide might be an evolved reproductive strategy in primates proved highly controversial, running counter to the then current conviction that primates act for the good of the group rather than to promote the reproductive interests of any individual.[16][20] Nevertheless, her findings have since been replicated in many animals and her explanations are widely accepted.[16] Even Trivers, who once dismissed her ideas about female sexual solicitations of multiple males, admits that her theory regarding female counter strategies to infanticide have \"worn well.\"[11]/nHrdy's third book came out in 1981: The Woman That Never Evolved. She begins chapter one with a sentence indicating that the results of her work suggest female agency should be given a lot more credit than previously assumed. \"Biology, it is sometimes thought, has worked against women.\"[21] Here, Hrdy expands upon female reproductive strategies.[22][23] The book was selected as one of The New York Times' Notable Books of 1981.[24]/nIn 1984, Hrdy co-edited Infanticide: Comparative and Evolutionary Perspectives.[25] It was selected as a 1984\u20131985 \"Outstanding Academic Book\" by Choice, the journal of the Association of College and Research Libraries.[26]/nIn 1999, Hrdy published Mother Nature: A history of mothers, infants, and natural selection. She examines \"human mothers and infants in a broader comparative and evolutionary framework,\"[27] informing and forming views of mother-infant interdependence from a sociobiological viewpoint.[28]/nIn it she described the trade-offs between subsistence and reproduction that mothers have to juggle, sometimes leading to difficult maternal investment \"decisions\".[29][30] Rather than assuming automatic maternal responses, Hrdy views \"maternal instinct\" as a process unfolding in line with local conditions and cues from the infant.[31] She stresses that an ape producing such costly offspring as humans could not have evolved unless mothers had had help from others, and had been what sociobiologists term cooperative breeders.[32]/nHumans evolved to rely on assistance from group members other than the mother, using the term \"allomother\" she first used in her 1975 PhD thesis describing infant-sharing in langurs (from the Greek \"allo\" for \"other than\") to refer to any female or male other than the mother who helps to care for an infant. In the human case allomothers are often a father, grandparents, or older siblings, as well as genetically unrelated helpers, including nannies, and child care groups, who help care for and provision infants, freeing the mother to meet her own needs and in the case of early humans, breed again sooner.[32]/nIn Mother Nature Hrdy argued that apes with the life history attributes of Homo sapiens could not have evolved unless alloparents in addition to parents had helped to care for and provision offspring, \"the Cooperative Breeding Hypothesis\".[33]/nIn 2009 in Mothers and Others, Hrdy explored cognitive and emotional implications for infants growing up in what was (for an ape) a novel developmental context.[34] Instead of relying on the single-minded dedication of their mothers, youngsters had to monitor and engage multiple caretakers as well.  Other apes possess cognitive wiring for rudimentary Theory of Mind, but with cooperative rearing, relevant potentials for mentalizing would have become more fully expressed, and thus rendered more visible to natural selection.  Over generations, those youngsters better at inter-subjective engagement would have been best cared for and fed, leading to directional Darwinian selection favoring peculiarly human capacities for intersubjective engagement.[33][35][36]/nIn 2014, Mothers and Others, together with earlier work, earned Hrdy the National Academy's Award for Scientific Reviewing in honor of her \"insightful and visionary synthesis of a broad range of data and concepts from across the social and biological sciences to illuminate the importance of biosocial processes among mothers, infants, and other social actors in forming the evolutionary crucible of human societies.\"[37]/nBecause of her research on parenting, Hrdy is a strong advocate for making affordable child care a priority.[11]/nTogether with Daniel Hrdy, Sarah Hrdy has endowed fellowships at the Radcliffe Institute as well as The Sarah and Daniel Hrdy Visiting Fellowship in Conservation Biology in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University,[38] followed in 2021 by endowment of the Daniel and Sarah Hrdy Fund for University of California Cooperative Extension research in sustainable agriculture and habitat restoration.[39]", "67025527": "Karl Richard Benjamin Schlossmann (19 February 1885 Puurmani Parish (now P\u00f5ltsamaa Parish, Kreis Dorpat \u2013 17 December 1969 Stockholm) was an Estonian microbiologist.

M. Balfour, FRS (10 November 1851 \u2013 19 July 1882) was a British biologist.[1] He lost his life while attempting the ascent of Mont Blanc. He was regarded by his colleagues as one of the greatest biologists of his day and Charles Darwin's successor./nThe younger brother of politician Arthur Balfour, he was born at Edinburgh in Scotland.  He attended Harrow School, where he tied with Arthur Evans, the future archaeologist of Knossos, for the Natural History Prize.[2] George Griffith, a teacher at Harrow, encouraged and aided him in the pursuit of natural science, a taste for which, especially geology, he had acquired from his mother. Entering Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1870, he was elected a natural science scholar of his college in the following year, and obtained second place in the Natural Science Tripos of December 1873.[3]/nA course of lectures on embryology, delivered by Sir Michael Foster in 1871, turned Balfour's attention to animal morphology.  After the tripos, he was selected to occupy one of the two seats allocated to the University of Cambridge at the Naples zoological station. The research work which he began there contributed in an important degree to his election as a Fellow of Trinity in 1874; and also gave him the material for a series of papers (published as a monograph in 1878) on the Elasmobranch fish, which threw new light on the development of several organs in the Vertebrates, in particular of the uro-genital and nervous systems./nHis next work was a large treatise, Comparative Embryology,[4] in two volumes; the first, published in 1880, dealing with the Invertebrates, and the second (1881) with the Vertebrates. This book displayed a vigorous scientific imagination, controlled by a logical sense that rigidly distinguished between fact and hypothesis, and it quickly won wide recognition, both as an admirable digest of the numberless observations made with regard to the development of animals during the quarter of a century preceding its publication, and as a work of original research./nBalfour's reputation was now such that other universities became anxious to secure his services, and he was invited to succeed Professor George Rolleston at Oxford and Sir Wyville Thomson at Edinburgh. Although he was only a college lecturer, holding no official post in his university, he declined to leave Cambridge, and in the spring of 1882 the university instituted a special Chair of Animal Morphology for his benefit./nHe was a committed Darwinian, though he disagreed with Darwin on the origins of larvae. Darwin assumed that larvae arose from the same stock as adults, but Balfour believed that virtually all larvae are 'secondary', i.e. they \"have become introduced into the ontogeny of species, the young of which were originally hatched with all the characters of the adult\".[5] In the case of echinoderms, he argued that the bilateral larvae must have been introduced after the establishment of the existing classes, and he challenged Haeckel's view that these larvae are evidence that echinoderms evolved from bilateral ancestors./nIn June 1878 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society,[6] and in 1881 was awarded their Royal Medal \"For his numerous and important contributions to animal morphology; and more especially for his investigations respecting the origin of the urogenital organs and the cerebrospinal nerves of the Vertebrata; and for his work on the development of the Elasmobranch fishes.\"/nBalfour never delivered a lecture in his new position. In the first term after his appointment he was prevented from working by an attack of typhoid fever, and went to the Alps for his health. Balfour and the guide Johann Petrus were killed, probably on 19 July 1882, attempting the ascent of the Aiguille Blanche, Mont Blanc, at that time unscaled.[7]/nBesides being a brilliant morphologist, Balfour was an accomplished naturalist. Charles Darwin referred to him as the \"Scottish Cuvier\".[7] Huxley thought he was \"the only man who can carry out my work\", and that the deaths of Balfour and W. K.

McMahon is a professor of Biological Sciences and Pharmacology at Vanderbilt University.[1] McMahon has contributed several important discoveries to the field of chronobiology and vision.  His research focuses on connecting the anatomical location in the brain to specific behaviors. As a graduate student under Gene Block, McMahon identified that the basal retinal neurons (BRNs) of the molluscan eye exhibited circadian rhythms in spike frequency and membrane potential, indicating they are the clock neurons. He became the 1986 winner of the Society for Neuroscience's Donald B. Lindsley Prize in Behavioral Neuroscience for his work. Later, he moved on to investigate visual, circadian, and serotonergic mechanisms of neuroplasticity. In addition, he helped find that constant light can desynchronize the circadian cells in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).[2] He has always been interested in the underlying causes of behavior and examining the long term changes in behavior and physiology in the neurological modular system. McMahon helped identifying a retrograde neurotransmission system in the retina involving the melanopsin containing ganglion cells and the retinal dopaminergic amacrine neurons.[3]/nMcMahon earned his Bachelor of Arts in biology from University of Virginia in 1980. Immediately after graduating, McMahon began a Ph.D. program in biology at Northwestern University. However, in 1981, McMahon found himself back at the University of Virginia where he completed his Ph.D. in biology under Gene D. Block. It was during this time that McMahon discovered the basal retinal neurons of the molluscan eye were the clock neurons. From 1986-1990, McMahon conducted his post-doctoral work in neurobiology at Harvard University with John E. Dowling.[4]/nMcMahon's work on molluscs with Gene Block led to a better understanding of the daily activity of the oscillating pacemaker cells.[5] Prior to this discovery, the identity of neuron types participating in retinal networks was largely known, but the specific physiological roles of the identified morphological structures were poorly understood.[6] In 2011, McMahon and Block found that retinal neurons in molluscs were active during the day, but inactive at night. Electrical stimulation at the tissue level of the retinal neurons during the day did not affect the organism. However, electrical stimulation at night caused a phase shift in the organism. Because stimulation yielded a phase shift, the results suggested that the retina contained a biological clock. McMahon and Block devised a model explaining these phenomena: light during the day does not have much of an effect on the neurons' activity, as they are already active. Light at night, on the other hand, when these neurons are inactive, stimulates them and causes them to fire action potentials. The change in electrical activity manifests itself as a phase shift within the organism.[5] Further research led them to find that phase shifting is a calcium-dependent process. They found that lowering extracellular levels of calcium actually prevents the organism from phase shifting in response to light without affecting the response of the neurons to light.[7] Around the same time, while Block and McMahon were conducting this experiment, other scientists discovered how to clone the period gene, marking an exciting time in the young field of chronobiology./nMcMahon contributed to the understanding of retinal neurophysiology alongside his post-doctoral mentor, John E. Dowling. His early research focused on ion channels that mediate transmission at electrical and glutamatergic synapses and the modulatory effects of dopamine and nitric oxide on retinal synapse networks.[9] Through studies with zebrafish he discovered that the neurotransmitter dopamine decreases the electrical coupling within horizontal cells.[10] Further research showed that it was the increase of cAMP within the cell resulting from dopamine binding to AMPA receptor that led to this decrease in coupling.[10] McMahon and his colleagues also demonstrated that exogenous nitric oxide and zinc can modulate AMPA receptor mediated synaptic transmission at gap junctions in hybrid bass retinal neurons.[9]/nThe work that won McMahon the Donald B. Lindsey Prize for PhD candidates involved locating and isolating specific regions of the eye that possessed circadian rhythms in Bulla gouldiana. Under the mentorship of Gene Block, McMahon recorded from the basal retinal neurons (BRNs), a homogenous group of neurons that are 15-25\u03bcm in diameter, of the snail's eye and found that they could entrain to light/dark cycles, and even oscillate in constant darkness with a consistent intrinsic period.[11] The BRN was later shown to entrain to light/dark cycles, and control physiological and behavioral oscillations within the entire organism.[12] McMahon and Block found an increase in firing frequency and depolarization of the BRNs during the day, but the opposite at night.[12] In addition, electrical activity between action potentials in the optic nerve and the firing of the BRNs were shown to share a 1:1 correlation.[13] In 1984, McMahon also demonstrated that the surgical removal of the photoreceptor layer failed to disrupt circadian rhythm in the Bulla eye, while the removal of the BRNs abolished circadian rhythm. His discovery that a fragment of Bulla retina containing as few as six intact BRN somata were sufficient for circadian rhythmogenesis further supported the BRNs as circadian pacemakers.[11][12] Later work by Dr. Stephan Michel using a surgical reductionist approach provided further evidence that isolated BRNs were capable of circadian oscillations in their conductance.[14]/nMcMahon's lab is currently interested in three areas of research: the role of dopamine on visual function and retinal physiology, links between molecular, intracellular, electrical, and behavioral rhythms in the brain's biological clock, and how perinatal photoperiod affects the serotonergic system and anxious/depressive behavior.[15] Alongside Dao-Qi Zhang, the lab has made significant contributions to the understanding of retinal neural network adaptation by dopaminergic amacrine neurons (DA neurons), revealing a retrograde neurotransmission pathway in the retina specifically involving melanopsin containing ganglion cells. McMahon's lab developed mouse models, which enable in situ electrophysiological recording from DA neurons.[3]/nIn early 2015, McMahon and his graduate students, Jeff Jones and Michael Tackenberg, found that circadian rhythms in mice could be shifted by artificial stimulus to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) using a laser and optical fiber.[16] Using optogenetics, the Vanderbilt researchers were able to change the firing rate of neurons in the SCN so that their firing resembled their normal day and night activity levels. Subsequently, altering the firing rate of the SCN neurons reset the biological clocks of the mice. Prior to this experiment, firing rate was thought to be strictly an output of the SCN. However, the results from this experiment suggest that firing rate is a more complex mechanism that is yet to be fully understood. Although not ready for direct human use, optogenetic stimulation techniques such as the one used by McMahon could potentially be used to treat seasonal affective disorder, reduce the adverse health effects of working a night shift, and even alleviate the symptoms of jet lag.[16]/nIn 2014, McMahon, along with Chad Jackson, Megan Capozzi, and Heng Dai, found that mice exposed to short, winter-like, light cycles showed enduring deficits in photopic retinal light responses and visual contrast sensitivity. Additionally, dopamine levels were significantly lower in short photoperiod mice. These findings suggest that seasonal light cycles experienced during retinal development and maturation have lasting influences on retinal and visual function, likely through developmental programming of retinal dopamine.[17]/nMcMahon's lab generated transgenic Per1::GFP mice in which a degradable form of recombinant jellyfish GFP reporter is driven by the mouse Per1 gene promoter. mPer1\u2010driven GFP fluorescence intensity reports light\u2010induction and circadian rhythmicity in neural structures of the SCN. The Per1::GFP transgenic mouse allows for the simultaneous quantification of molecular clock state and the firing rate of SCN neurons. Thus, this circadian reporter transgene depicts gene expression dynamics of biological clock neurons, giving a new view of this brain function.[18]/nMcMahon has held multiple positions in academia:/nMcMahon has also been a member of many scientific communities.

Their grandfather was an x-ray crystallographer, their father, Howard Eisen a physician, and mother, Laura[10] a biochemist. They moved to Bethesda, Maryland when Eisen was four or five years old. The brothers spent summers in Long Island with their grandparents. Eisen states that he loved frogs and salamanders '\"Even more than I have a frog fetish, I have a swamp fetish. I really like being in swamps.\"'  He was also very interested in math and was captain of the high school math team. Eisen graduated from Walt Whitman High School in 1985.

He is  a self-proclaimed Red Sox fanatic.[11] He and computational biologist James Fraser recorded a video for iBiology about the role baseball statistics influenced their research. Their argument is that sequencing DNA is similar to scoring a baseball game, and that many computational biologists learned to think about science computations from an obsessive interest in baseball stats. The exercise of comparing a specific player's stats to a database of other similar players allows a baseball fan to predict future performance. This same system works with proteins and predicting functions. As tools are developed that break down and track all stats concerning baseball players, so will technology improve with genetics. With both baseball and genetics, tools are being developed that refine the models.[16]  In a lecture in 2015, Eisen stated that he received a computer from his grandfather for his twelfth birthday and spent the next five years teaching himself how to program so that he could keep track of baseball stats.[13]/nHis academic research focuses on the evolution of gene regulation.[17][18][19][20] Despite this focus, Eisen's work has historically spanned very diverse disciplines.

Eisen's reasons for running for Congress included his perception that the Trump administration was unresponsive to climate change and other science-related issues. Another reason Eisen decided to run was his experience watching Cabinet appointees being interviewed by the Senate about climate change. He thought '\u201cIt would be really nice to have scientists ask the questions of the Cabinet appointees, because the senators don\u2019t seem to understand the issue and aren\u2019t asking the right questions.\u201d'[12] He feels that if science is to be on the forefront of policy making, '\"scientists need to run for office.\"' He felt that 2018's California jungle primaries afforded him a better chance at making the final two for the general election, but he did not make the final two (which were Dianne Feinstein and Kevin de Le\u00f3n).[12]/nFor a really long time, scientists have watched political processes erode \u2014 and have watched politicians openly deride science, dismissing the role that science plays in our everyday life.

We should try to figure out what\u2019s going on in the world and then debate the best way to do it, to make the world better.

He studied medicine at the University of Berlin and received his doctorate degree in 1839, and became a Professor of Anatomy at the University of Bonn. Schaaffhausen soon became involved in research in physical anthropology and the study of prehistoric humans in Europe. He is best known for his study of the Neanderthal fossils (together with J.C.

A local schoolmaster Johann Carl Fuhlrott, who was interested in geology and paleontology, learned of the discovery and went to the site to collect the unusual bones. They consisted of the top portion of a skull, a clavicle and scapula, the right and left ulnae, a radius bone, the left hip bone, and the right and left femora. Fuhlrott was immediately struck by the fact that the bones appeared to be completely fossilized and the geological location of the bones in the cave, both suggesting that the bones were extremely old. Fuhlrott, recognizing the possible scientific significance of the find, brought the bones to Schaaffhausen in Bonn for analysis. Schaaffhausen was impressed by the primitive form of the skull and the evidence for their geological antiquity./nFuhlrott and Schaaffhausen presented papers on the fossils and the geology of the Feldhofer Cave at a meeting of the Niederrheinische Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Natur- und Heilkunde (Lower Rhine Society for Natural History and Medical Studies) in Bonn in 1857.

Fuhlrott and Schaaffhausen believed the Neanderthal fossils dated from the Glacial Period when extinct animals such as mammoths and the woolly rhinoceros still lived in Europe, which would make them among the oldest human remains known. This was before scientists believed humans lived during the Ice Age. Furthermore, Schaaffhausen noted that the Neanderthal skull differed from modern human skulls. He argued that the prominent bony ridges over the eyes and the general shape of the skull indicated that it belonged to a savage and barbarous race of human. Schaaffhausen concluded that the bones belonged to the original wild race of humans that lived in Europe before modern European peoples migrated into Europe in prehistoric times./nThe fossils generated considerable debate among anthropologists in Germany and abroad. The prominent German anthropologist Rudolf Virchow rejected Schaaffhausen's interpretation of the fossils, considering them the pathological remains of an ancient human. However, in 1864 William King, professor of geology at Queens College in Galway, Ireland, presented a paper where he argued the Neanderthal fossils belonged to an extinct species of early human that he named Homo neanderthalensis.

In addition to his primary work in plant genetics, Gottlieb was an advocate for rare and endangered plant conservation./nFollowing a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Cornell University in 1957, Gottlieb's career began at Oregon State University in the Botany and Plant Pathology Department. He earned a master's degree in December 1965 with major professor Dr. Kenton Chambers and wrote a thesis on hybridization between species of manzanita (Arctostaphylos) trees in southwestern Oregon.[3]  His PhD at the University of Michigan 1969 examined patterns of diversity and mechanisms of speciation in Stephanomeria. He was a faculty member of the Department of Genetics at the University of California, Davis from 1970 until 2004./nGottlieb researched a broad array of subjects including plant systematics, plant speciation (Quantum Speciation), polyploidy, gene duplication, biochemical evolution of isozymes and molecular genetics, and published more than 120 research papers[4] and received a number of awards including a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship (1975) and Fellowship of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1985). In 1993 he was named Alumni Association Fellow of Oregon State University. In 1965 he earned his master's degree and wrote a thesis on hybridization between species of manzanita in southwestern Oregon./nGottlieb was occupied with new species formation via \"quantum speciation\" throughout his career.   As defined by Verne Grant,[5] and cited by Gottlieb in his 2003 summary of the subject in plants[6] \"we can define quantum speciation as the budding off of a new and very different daughter species from a semi-isolated peripheral population of the ancestral species in a cross-fertilizing organism...as compared with geographical speciation, which is a gradual and conservative process, quantum speciation is rapid and radical in its phenotypic or genotypic effects or both.\" Grant thought that it would be accompanied by inbreeding in the founder population.  Therefore, \"quantum speciation\" would be related to, if not identical with, in Gottlieb's use of the term, sympatric speciation.  In fact Gottlieb's first publication on \"sympatric speciation\" in Stephanomeria', published in 1971,[7] was summarised by him in the above 2003 paper on \"quantum speciation.\"  Gottlieb did not believe that sympatric speciation required disruptive selection to form a reproductive isolating barrier, as defined by Grant, and in fact Gottlieb stated that requiring disruptive selection was \"unnecessarily restrictive\"[7] in identifying cases of sympatric speciation./nIn terminology used by Gottlieb, \"progenitor species \" would be the parental or \"ancestral\" species and the newly formed daughter species was \"derived.\"/nIn his first study of progenitor-derivative pairs of species, Gottlieb examined the diploid, geographically limited, self-pollinating derived species Stephanomeria malheurensis with the  diploid, geographically widespread obligate outcrossing ancestral species Stephanomeria exicua ssp. coronaria.[7] In this case the reproductive isolating barrier was probably a change from outcrossing to selfing, and was maintained by this and a high degree of inter-specific sterility with ssp. coronaria as a result of chromosomal structural differences.  Using what was then the most modern molecular technique, starch gel electrophoresis, to determine the genetics of populations[8] Gottlieb found that S. malheurensis had a subset of the genetic variability of ssp. coronaria. This, as well as its geographical close proximity, led Gottlieb to propose that S. malhurensis was a product of \"quantum speciation.\" Additionally, S. malheurensis was found to be much less adapted to the local habitat than ssp. coronaria (hence the name malhurensis, which in French, \"Malheur\" means unhappiness or misfortune), indicating that it was probably not formed by disruptive selection./nIn his second study of progenitor-derivative pairs of species, Gottlieb looked at the putative progenitor diploid Clarkia rubicunda and its hypothesized derivative, diploid C. franciscana.[9] In 1958, Lews and Raven[10] hypothesized that C. franciscana, which was highly self-pollinating and geographically limited, was derived from the outcrossing and more widespread C. rubicunda by large chromosomal structural rearrangements.  Lewis and Raven hypothesized that C. franciscana had rapidly speciated from C. rubicunda by a mechanism Harlan Lewis called \"catastrophic selection.\"[11][12] As with Stephanomeria, Gottlieb hypothesized that if C. franciscana was a derived species by \"rapid speciation,\" then the derived species should have a genetic compliment that is similar to its progenitor, \"i.e., possess few novel alleles.\"[9] In fact, Gottlieb found that C. franciscana was genetically distinct from C. rubicunda; it did not, as expected, have a subset of the genes found in C. rubicunda. A subsequent analysis published in 1992 on another population of C. franciscana, unknown to Gottlieb 20 years earlier, led to similar conclusions.[13]  Importantly Gottlieb ended his 1973 study of C. franciscana by stating: \"To strengthen phylogenetic analyses of rapid speciation, the criterion is proposed that a species accepted as having had a rapid and recent origin by chromosomal reorganization be substantially similar to its progenitor upon electrophoretic examination.\" In this context Gottlieb equated \"electrophoretic examination\" with genetic examination by the use of isozymes.[8] And, using this criterion, Gottlieb was not able to conclude that C. franciscana was derived from its putative progenitor C. rubicunda, as hypothesized by Lewis and Raven in 1958.[10]/nThe next progenitor-derived pair of species Gottlieb examined were diploid Clarkia biloba and diploid Clarkia lingulata. C. biloba is geographically widespread, while C. lingulata is known from only two populations on the southern periphery of C. biloba; both are highly outcrossing, and there is no evidence that C. lingulata is better adapted to its habitat than C. biloba. They differ from each other by chromosomal structural differences, and hybrids between them are sterile. Lewis and Roberts proposed in 1956[14] that C. lingulata arose from C. biloba rapidly and in close proximity; in 1962,[11] Lewis coined the term \"catastrophic selection\" to define its mode of origin. Gottlieb[15] using starch gel electrophoresis, determined that indeed C. lingulata had a high degree of genetic similarity to C. biloba, with fewer alleles and reduced heterozygosity. Subsequent studies[16][17] confirmed a sister species relationship using chloroplast DNA as well as nucleotide sequences of the gene phosphoglucose isomerase.  Gottlieb stated that this species pair, too, arose from quantum speciation.[6]/nSimilar work was done with species pairs in the genus Layia. Here, the widespread progenitor was the diploid L. glandulosa, while the more restricted was the diploid L. discoidea.  Both are obligate outcrossers, though the former has ray flowers while the latter only has disc flowers.  Further, both are completely interfertile, while L. discoidea is restricted to serpentine habitats. As with the former species pairs, Gottlieb applied the electrophoretic test to these species and found that they had a very high genetic identity for the isozymes studied.[18] Therefore, the Gottlieb and Ford concluded that these two species were related as progenitor and derivative.  Gottlieb proposed that L. discoidea arose relatively recently from adaptation to serpentine soils, also as an example of quantum speciation.[6]/nIn his 2003 review, Gottlieb [6] summarized:/nThe general lesson from the review of these studies is that quantum speciation remains an important and useful concept that can be applied to a greater variety of situations than initially envisaged. The genetic and chromosomal changes need not be as radical as once supposed, and a new species may originate and persist even without novel adaptations./nAnother species pair that Gottlieb studied involved Gaura longiflora and G. demareei; both species are annuals, diploids, highly inter-fertile and obligate outcrossers.[19] In this study Gottlieb demonstrated that G. demareei was genetically highly similar to Gaura longiflora. Although he did not use the words \"quantum speciation\" in this study, Gottlieb concluded that these species pairs represented, as with Clarkia and Stephanomeria above, that \"speciation in annual plants that are obligately outcrossing can occur with minimal genetic differentiation and accords with previous results for self-pollinating species.\" And further, that \"speciation in annual plants appears not to be consistent with the orthodox views of the process (e.g., Mayr, 1963), which propose that organisms acquire reproductive isolation as an important by-product of adapting to habitats different from that of the parental ones, that this process marks a substantial genetic reconstitution, and that it occurs gradually over long periods of time.\"[19]/nAnother subject that intrigued Gottlieb throughout his career was that of polyploidy.  In a commemorative 2014 review, Soltis et al.[20] refer to Gottlieb and Roose's 1976 paper on Tragopogon as a \"classic\" in the field.[21] In Soltis et al.'s words: \"This classic paper addressed the link between genotype and biochemical phenotype and documented enzyme additivity in allopolyploids. Perhaps more important than their model of additivity, however, was their demonstration of novelty at the biochemical level. Enzyme multiplicity\u2014the production of novel enzyme forms in the allopolyploids\u2014can provide an extensive array of polymorphism for a polyploid individual and may explain, for example, the expanded ranges of polyploids relative to their diploid progenitors.\"/nAlthough Gottlieb was not the first to hypothesize that enzyme multiplicity from dimeric isozymes could benefit the adaptedness of polyploids,[22] his work on glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase in 1973 on the allotetraploid Stephanomeria elata[23] was amongst the earliest as well as the first in a wild plant.  Their classic 1976 paper[21] also demonstrated the utility of isozymes in sorting out a complicated systematics in  Tragopogon, the presence of fixed heterozygosity in its polyploids, as well as the occurrence of novel isozymes (multimers) in the Tragopogon allopolyploids./nGottlieb's further studies on polyploidy were concerned with the fates of those genes that were duplicated by an allopolyploidization event. That is, he was interested to know if the homeologus genomes of allopolyploids were changed by being in the same nucleus\u2014were there novel patterns of gene expression that may influence fitness;[24] or, to quote Gottlieb in 1999 do \"...polyploid species evolve differently than their diploid parents\".[25]  To sort this out, Gottlieb maintained that one had to know if any differences one saw in the allopolyploid were indeed differences from polyploidization or were they a \"legacy\" of the diploid progenitors.[26]/nIn 1980, Roose and Gottlieb showed that in the recent (less than 100 years old) allotetraploid Tragopogon miscellus, the genes for alcohol dehydrogenase reflected their expression in the diploid parents\u2014there was no gene silencing, changes in tissue expression, or other effect on the catalytic properties of the enzyme.[27]  In 1999, Ford and Gottlieb[25] found that the tetraploid Clarkia gracilis expressed the same genes for cytosolic phosphoglucose isomerase as the diploid parents; in this case gene silencing was identified in C. gracilis but they concluded that it probably occurred in one of the diploid parents, which was extinct.  This was not the case when Gottlieb and Ford looked at the recent allotetraploids Clarkia delicata and C. similis.[28] In C. similis a gene producing phosphoglucose isomerase (called PgiC2) was silenced after the polyploidization event, while in C. delicata it was polymorphic for a normal gene and a silenced gene.  As the authors concluded PgiC2 in C. delicata \"presents an example of a natural experiment in progress because the defective allele may yet be fixed or lost from the species.\"[28] Further, Ford and Gottlieb[25] postulated that silenced genes in polyploid plants could be repositories of silenced genes for \"plant breeding, for example, to alter metabolism or development of cultivated relatives.\"/nAlthough Gottlieb did much pioneering work on gene duplication in polyploids, he also pioneered studying gene duplication in diploids. He conducted  many studies on various genes in several species, summarizing his work up to 1982 in Clarkia and Stephanomeria with duplicated genes producing  phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and triosephosphate isomerase (TPI).[24] In that review, he reported that PGI in Clarkia was produced in both the cytosol and plastids by one or two nuclear genes controlling the cytosolic PGI and one nuclear gene controlling the plastid PGI.[29][30][31] The cytosolic genes received the majority of his attention, which were found to be either single or duplicated. Further, the duplicated genes were hypothesized to have arisen by translocations rather than by un-equal crossing over.  Gottlieb applied gene duplications in determining the phylogeny of \"Clarkia\", because \"Duplications originating by chromosomal rearrangements have a high probability of being unique.   Thus species with the PGI duplication presumably descended from a single references ancestor and can now be grouped into a monophyletic assemblage...\"[24] He conducted biochemical studies of the cytosolic PGIs in Clarkia xantiana, and found that there was very little difference in PGI's produced by the duplicated genes.[32] In this same review he reported on a \"family\" of duplicated genes in Stephanomeria exigua that controlled the production of ADH. Here Roose and Gottlieb found that several tightly linked genes were inherited as one unit, and that populations could be polymorphic for duplicated and non-duplicated  genes.[33] He reported[24] in Stephanomeria exigua that TPI was produced by two nuclear genes that assorted independently, and that hybrid enzymes between the two loci were not found.[34] In Clarkia species both cytosolic and plastid TPI are produced by duplicated genes, and that both loci have genetic variability.[24][35]/nPost 1982 Gottlieb continued to work on other enzyme systems produced by duplicated loci in different species.  In Clarkia he reported that duplicated genes for 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGD) occurred throughout the genus for both cytosolic and plastid 6-PGD.[36] In homosporus ferns he found a duplicated gene for TPI, resulting in the only case of heterozygosity resulting from gene duplication in ferns\u2014counter to previous theory.[37] In Layia Gottlieb [38] found that isocitrate dehydrognease (IDH) isozymes had one gene controlling plastid IDH and 2-3 duplicated genes controlling cytosolic IDH. In this same study with Layia he found that phosphoglucomutase (PGM) also had one gene controlling plastid PGM, and duplicated cytosolic genes. He also examined six additional genera in the Madieae, and, with Layia representing 7 of the 10 genera in this tribe of the Asteraceae. Since he found that the duplicated cytosolic PGM were found in all the genera, he postulated that the duplication may have been present at the formation of this tribe, and hypothesized that examining PGM in other tribes may help understand phylogenic relationships in the Asteraceae. Further, he asserted that the discovery of duplicated genes in the tribe Madinae, along with the work of others, supported the view that duplicated genes in flowering plants was widespread. Additionally, since all such duplicated genes were unlinked, he favored the view that duplications were the result of overlapping reciprocal translocations rather than by unequal crossing-over. Gottlieb also applied PGM isozymes to species in the genus Clarkia, and found that some species had duplicated plastid PGM, others had duplicated cytosolic PGM, and that their phylogenetic distribution was consistent with earlier work on PGI.[39]/nBy far the majority of Gottlieb's gene duplication work was done with PGI in Clarkia, though he also compared the PGI from the bacteria Escherichia coli with Clarkia, showing that the nuclear encoded chloroplast (plastid) isozyme of  PGI  from Clarkia xantiana when compared to Escherichia coli shared 87.6% of its amino acid sequences. They also predicted that the cytosolic PGI's in higher plants would be considerably different than the plastid PGI's, given the hypothesized prokaryotic origin of plastid DNA, though would be more similar to eucaryotes.[40] In 1996 Gottlieb and Ford[41] reported that the cytosolic duplicated genes PGI1 and PGI2 were ancestral to all Clarkia, but that some species had a silenced PGI2, and that the PGI2 had been silenced at least four times independently. Gottlieb's second to last paper studied PGI duplications in other genera of the Onagraceae.[42] From this work Gottlieb and Ford found that their PGI results supported work based on chloroplast genes and nuclear ITS sequences, and that cytosolic PGI genes showed a greater rate of divergence than that based on chloroplast genes, and therefore supplied more information. Further, they found that the PGI gene duplications of PGI1 and PGI2 occurred well before the \"radiation of extant species\" of Clarkia./nGottlieb's first published scientific paper in 1968 was based on his M.S. Thesis, and concerned itself with the taxonomy of Arctostaphylos viscida and A. canescens.[43] In this he was concerned with hybrids between the two and the taxonomic status of their hybrids, concluding that such hybrids were not eligible for taxonomic status as a previous investigator reported. His next publication in 1971[44] was based on his Ph.D. thesis, and was concerned with phylogenetic relationships in Stephanomeria. This followed in 1972 with a taxonomy of Stephanomeria.[45] During these early years he developed an interest in isozymes, and he published a 1971[8] paper discussing their use in evolutionary studies. Using this new technique he applied isozymes to a taxonomic problem in Stephanomeria, and was able to demonstrate the origin of Stephanomeria malheurensis by quantum speciation (see above).  He continued to apply isozymes to other taxa, and clarified species relationships in other genera such as Clarkia, Layia, Gaura, and Tragopogon, largely relying on gene duplication and silencing results (discussed above)./nFrom 1971 onward Gottlieb used all traditional cytogenetic, ecological, morphological, and molecular techniques as they became available to solve systematics problems, primarily within Clarkia and the Onagraceae as well as Stephanomeria and the Cichorieae.   Isozymes were used during most of his career.  It wasn't until 1986[46][47] that he applied a newer molecular technique: chloroplast DNA variation using Restriction fragment length polymorphism in determining the origin of Heterogaura from Clarkia, as well as clarifying species relationships in Clarkia.  In these two papers Gottlieb and Systma confirmed previous phylogenic results found with earlier isozyme work, as well as exposing limitations of earlier phylogenetic models that only used morphology and reproductive isolation.  Post 1986 he continued working with others using gene duplication of PGM in Clarkia and IDH in Layia (references above), including flavonoids in Stephanomeria.[48] In this latter work he showed that the two progenitor-derivative species S. exigua ssp. coronaria and S. malheurensis were also nearly identical, concordant with earlier genetic studies.  He continued work on the phylogeny of Clarkia, using restriction site mapping of chloroplast DNA[49] and then in 1996 Ford and Gottlieb[41] using  nucleotide sequencing of the duplicated PGI genes further clarified Sections within Clarkia.  In 2002[50] he used an analysis of 18S-26S nuclear rDNA and its ITS and ETS sequences to further examine the phylogeny of Stephanomeria; in this he concluded that the annuals probably evolved more recently than the perennials, and further confirmed the progenitor-derived status of S. malheurensis. In 2006[51] he and others examined sequences of PgiC in Stephanomeria, and showed that it had more resolution for determining species differences than the earlier ITS/ETS results.  In 2003[52] using 18S-26S nuclear rDNA ITS and ETS sequences he expanded his examination of the phylogeny of Stephanomeria  to include all 24 North American genera within the tribe Cichorieae, and produced the first modern comprehensive phylogeny of the group. This work gave him the background for his contributions to the 2006 Flora of North America[53] as well as his contributions to The Jepson Manual in 2012,[54] his last publication./nGottlieb was involved with the description of several new species and subspecies, including new species Stephanomeria malheurensis, new species S. fluminea,[55] a subspecies of Clarkia concinna,[56] and a subspecies of Clarkia mildrediae.[57]/nIn 1984 Gottlieb summarized a large body of literature regarding the genetic control of plant morphology.[58] He was motivated because of \"recent controversies about macroevolution.\"[58] That is, a central tenet of neo-darwinian evolution is that evolution occurs by the accumulation of small genetic changes over time as opposed to the involvement of fewer genes with larger effects.   In his review[58] he concluded that/nMany differences, particularly those of presence versus absence, and those of changed structure, shape, or architectural orientation are frequently governed by one or two genes; discrete phenotypic alternatives are common./nThis paper resulted in a rebuttal by Coyne and Lande in 1985,[59] which was countered by Gottlieb in 1985.[60]  Gottlieb concluded his rebuttal by stating/nI agree with Coyne and Lande...that \"counting gene differences and measuring their effects form in themselves important tests of neo-Darwinism,\" but I find that it is frequently not apparent which genes should be counted, and that the proposed test cannot be convincing in the absence of developmental evidence that identifies the ontogenetic and anatomical details of character divergence./nIn 1986 Gottlieb reviewed the literature in crop plants and reiterated his assertion that plant architecture was controlled by only a few genes.[61]\nA series of subsequent studies in wild plants by Gottlieb bolstered his assertions that important evolutionary changes need not involve many small genes.  In 1988 Gottlieb and Ford reported on floral pigmentation in Clarkia gracilis and discovered a basal spot allele that was unique and normally was unexpressed. They concluded: \"It is an interesting speculation that many loci include alleles that normally remain unexpressed. Segregation following hybridization, frequent in plants, may place such alleles, as well as normally expressed alleles, under new patterns of regulation resulting in the abrupt appearance of novel forms.\"[62] In 1989 Gottlieb concluded that floral spot patterns in Clarkia were controlled by only a few genes, and that \"The flower is a complex structure in which many specialized tissues and cell types form distinctive organs in a precise and orderly manner.  The differentiation of structures is most likely independent of pigmentation pattern, and this is one reason the patterns may be changed by a few genes. Although the patterns may have a simple and readily modified developmental basis, pigment patterns are likely to have complex effects on pollination and eventual seed set.\"[63] Ford and Gottlieb[64] performed an extensive analysis of the genetic control of flower differences between the two closely related species Layia glandulosa and L. discoidea, related as progenitor and derivative, respectively. The two species differ primarily by presence versus absence of ray florets. They confirmed earlier results[65] that the primary difference in ray flowers was due to a single gene. However, they also found a novel floret called \"gibbous,\" and demonstrated that there were numerous gene differences between the species that affected the ray florets size, shape, and color. They concluded:/nCharacterization of evolutionary morphological changes as major or minor is illusory unless founded on genetic analysis: the demonstration that the absence of ray florets in L. discoidea is conferred by a simple genetic difference shows that this was not a large change despite the accretion of a considerable number of differences between the species. The discovery of gibbous fiorets has particular interest because it demonstrates that novel combinations of developmental processes can be readily assimilated without evident adverse effects. The complex admixture of genes with large and small, qualitative and quantitative, effects may prove typical as more instances of morphological evolution are subjected to intensive genetic analysis./nIn his last paper discussing the impact of simple genetic changes having large effects on plant morphology, Ford and Gottlieb in 1992[66] described a naturally occurring recessive gene that converts the petals of Clarkia concinna to sepals, making an eight sepaled plant with no petals. They concluded:/nThe absence of deleterious pleiotropy or fitness-reducing epistatic interactions in bicalyx suggests that mutations with extensive morphological consequences can be successfully accommodated by plant developmental systems.  If such mutants were to become associated with chromosomal rearrangements reducing the fertility of hybrids between them and their progenitors, a process that has occurred repeatedly in Clarkia, the new population would probably be accorded species status.  Although the frequency of establishment of such mutations is unknown, bicalyx demonstrates that the kind of regulatory mutations being studied by plant developmental biologists may contribute to morphological diversification in nature./nGottlieb also examined the genetic effects of single gene mutations by examining the protein expressions in the historically important Round v. Wrinkled isogenic pea genes examined by Gregor Mendel.[67] Being isogenic, these lines only differed at the r-gene locus; however, Gottlieb found that approximately 10% of the proteins were different between these two lines, indicating that these single gene mutations had many pleiotropic effects.  Another study in peas involving genes controlling leaves, tendrils, and stipules did not find evidence of pleiotropy.[68]/nGiven that some of the species Gottlieb worked with were restricted to very small populations, such as Clarkia lingulata, Clarkia franciscana, and Stephanomeria malheurensis, it is not surprising that he became an advocate for rare and endangered plant conservation.[69][70]  His impact is perhaps best seen by his work on S. malheurensis, which he discovered, and for which S. malheurensis  received Federal protection in 1974.  Gottlieb was involved in its protection and as well as re-establishment when it became threatened by cheatgrass in Oregon.[71]/nIn 1975 Gottlieb wrote a comparison of the two ways Charles Darwin, as a scientist, and Herman Melville, as an artist,  viewed the Galapagos Islands.[72] According to Gottlieb, Darwin saw the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands as a \"laboratory where he was able to examine closely process of evolution and the origin of species,\" while Melville \"used them to derive a set of symbols to express his perception of the human condition.\"[72] Gottlieb concluded that the Gal\u00e1pagos of Darwin and Melville \"have different uses and appeal to different sensibilities.\"[72]/nDuring 2011, Gottlieb received treatment for pancreatic cancer and had a good period of recovery until the end of the year. Early in 2012 the cancer had returned and following complications associated with the disease, Gottlieb died on January 31, 2012.[73]/nGottlieb has been described as \"one of the most influential plant evolutionary biologists over the past several decades.\"[2] Leslie Gottlieb was honored at a Colloquium in 2013 which updated and extended many of his research areas,[74] as well as by a 2014 theme issue of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B.[75]/nCrawford et al. state \"Leslie Gottlieb was interested in floral development before the age of genomics and the evolution of development (evo-devo)...\"[76] Hileman states that the genetic changes studied in the model plant Antirrhinum majus were identified by Gottlieb as being of the type that \"may provide genetic information about floral traits that distinguish species or genera.\"[77] Consequently, the development of modern evolutionary thought that now incorporates evo-devo was clearly anticipated by Gottlieb./nThe Leslie and Vera Gottlieb Research Fund in Plant Evolutionary Biology was established in 2006 to provide funds to graduate students to support both laboratory and field research in the evolutionary biology of plants native to western North America.

He said \"I was just appalled at what I was reading.

Jackson lives in New York City and Brooksville, Maine, where he guest reads to elementary school students about environmental issues in Maine./nDr. Jackson started his career as a marine biologist studying the distribution of bryozoans and their behavior. His work on marine bryozoans provided some of the strongest evidence to date for the controversial punctuated equilibrium model of evolutionary change. In addition to the bryozoan work, Jackson produced influential studies on coral reef communities and served as a central figure in a Smithsonian Institution investigation of ecosystems in Panama and the surrounding regions./nJackson also studied the impact of Hurricane Allen on reefs in Jamaica. The resulting paper[6] confidently predicted recovery of the reef. A few years later, in Jamaica Jackson led a study concerning the impact of an oil spill on the nearshore regions affected. The result: corals affected by the spill died, but so did others, outside the stressed region. The reason for lack of recovery inside impacted regions and deterioration outside such regions, Jackson decided, was human activity./nConcerned about the increasing effect of human impacts on marine ecosystems, Jackson created what is now known as \"historical ecology\" of marine ecosystems. Using historical and ecological sources, Jackson demonstrated that green sea turtles in the pre-Columbian Caribbean used to exist by the tens of millions, greater than current populations. After that first attempt at understanding what pristine marine ecosystems looked like, Jackson assembled an international team of ecologists, anthropologists, archeologists, and historians, to reconstruct marine ecosystem dynamics from the last several hundred years./nThe first result of this interdisciplinary working group was a paper[7] led by Jackson showing that fishing predated any other major disturbance to marine ecosystems in the Holocene. This paper was chosen as the most important contribution of the year 2001 by Discover Magazine.[8] It is, so far, the most cited paper coming out of the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) in Santa Barbara, and one of the most cited papers in marine ecology.

He once confided, \"I never pursue one branch of science more than ten years, but lay it aside and go into new fields.\"[1]/nHaldeman was born in Locust Grove, Pennsylvania on August 12, 1812, the oldest of seven children of Henry Haldeman and Frances Stehman Haldeman. Locust Grove was the family estate on the Susquehanna River, twenty miles below Harrisburg. His father was a prosperous businessman and his mother was an accomplished musician who died when Haldeman was twelve years old. In 1826, he was sent to Harrisburg to attend school at the Classical Academy, run by John M. Keagy. After two years in the academy, he enrolled at Dickinson College where his interest in natural history was encouraged by his professor, Henry Darwin Rogers, who would later become a distinguished geologist.[1][2] Two years after entering Dickinson, the college was forced to close temporarily and Peck left without earning a diploma.[3]/nAfter leaving school, Haldeman took over management of his father's new sawmill and became a silent partner with two of his brothers who started an iron manufacturing business in the area. He eventually became an authority on smelting iron. However, he was always drawn to science and often neglected the family businesses in pursuit of these interests.[3] He later said, \"I developed a taste for rainy weather and impassable roads; then I could remain undisturbed in the perusal of my books.\"[1] In 1833\u20131834, he attended lectures in the medical department at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in order to better prepare himself for the study of natural history.[2]/nIn 1835, Haldeman wrote an article for the Lancaster Journal refuting the Great Moon Hoax, a sensational story claiming that life had been observed on the moon.[4] That same year his former professor, Henry D. Rogers, was appointed state geologist of New Jersey and in 1836 he sent for Haldeman to assist him. A year later, on the reorganization of the Pennsylvania geological survey, Haldeman transferred there, and was actively engaged on the survey until 1842, preparing five annual reports, and personally surveying Dauphin and Lancaster counties./nDuring the 1840s, Haldeman's interests were focused on the natural history of invertebrates, especially the taxonomy of beetles and freshwater mollusks. In 1840 he began the publication of his Monograph of the Freshwater Univalve Mollusca of the United States, issued in nine parts with the final volume not appearing until 1866.[4] The monograph was well received by the scientific community in America and Europe. In an addendum he described Scolithus linearis, a trace fossil of some burrowing organism, the most ancient organic remains known at the time. In 1844 he wrote a paper, \"Enumeration of the Recent Freshwater Mollusca Which are Common to North America and Europe\", where he laid out in detail the case for Lamarckian evolution and transmutation of species. In 1861, Charles Darwin wrote in a preface to his On the Origin of Species an acknowledgment  of Haldeman's ideas in support of evolution.[1][5]/nHe was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1844.[6]/nIn 1842 he was instrumental in the establishment of the Entomological Society of Pennsylvania, the first scientific society formed to study insects in America. Haldeman's participation in the society put him in regular contact with other leading American entomologists including Frederick E. Melsheimer and John G. Morris.[7] His first entomological paper was the \"Catalogue of the Carabideous Coleoptera of South Eastern Pennsylvania,\" published in 1842. Over the next 15 years he published many papers on the systematics of beetles and other insects, describing many new species. His ear was remarkably sensitive, and he discovered a new organ of sound in lepidopterous insects, which was described by him in Benjamin Silliman's American Journal of Science in 1848. In 1852 he wrote a description of the insects collected by the Stansbury survey of the Great Salt Lake.[2]/nIn addition to his work on entomology, Haldeman accepted various college appointments to teach natural history. In 1842 he was a professor of zoology at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. From 1851 until 1855 he was professor of natural history at the University of Pennsylvania. He then accepted a similar professorship in Delaware College. Meanwhile, he also lectured on geology and chemistry at the State Agricultural College of Pennsylvania.[3] He visited Texas in 1851 to investigate the presidency of an institution there, but declined the position. On his return trip from Texas, he was offered the position of president of Masonic College in Selma, Alabama, which he accepted and held from January to October 1852.[8]/nIn the 1850s, Haldeman's focus turned to the study of language. He carried out extensive research among Amerindian dialects, and also in Pennsylvania Dutch, besides investigations in the English, Chinese, and other languages. Haldeman was an earnest advocate of spelling reform. He was a member of many scientific societies, was the founder and president of the American Philological Association, and one of the early members of the National Academy of Sciences. In 1858, Haldeman was awarded the Trevelyan Prize, given by the Phonetic Society of Great Britain, for his article entitled \"Analytic Orthography\".[3] He made numerous visits to Europe for purposes of research, and when studying the human voice in Rome determined the vocal repertoire of 40\u201350 varieties of human speech.  In 1869, he returned to the University of Pennsylvania as a professor of comparative philology and remained there until his death in 1880.[1]/nIn 1835, Haldeman married Mary A. Hough and the couple had two sons and two daughters. After the wedding, they moved to a new home at the base of Chickies Rock. He had designed the house and laid out the extensive gardens with native specimens of trees and shrubs. Raised a Protestant, Haldeman converted to Catholicism in the 1840s after undertaking a systematic study of different religions. He died suddenly of a heart attack on September 10, 1880 at his home in Chickies, Pennsylvania.[1][9]/nHe was the author of some 150 publications including important works on entomology, conchology, and philology.[3]", "45562788": "Curtis Huttenhower is a Professor of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics in the Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Harvard University.[7][10][11][12]/nHuttenhower gained his BS from the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 2000, where he majored in computer science, chemistry and mathematics.

In response to the decision by the editors to retract the paper and the conflict of interest charges against Lubchenco, an official of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy agreed that the paper should be retracted, but \". . . there\u2019s no evidence that Jane\u2019s [Lubchenco\u2019s] work with the task force resulted in any pulled punch on the topic.\u201d[19] On February 10, 2022, three senior Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives\u2019 Committee on Science, Space, and Technology sent a letter to the President of the United States asking for an investigation of Lubchenco\u2019s professional behavior and encouraging \u201c. . . you to consider if Dr. Lubchenco should continue to be involved in developing a framework for the improvement of agency scientific integrity policies and practices when she has violated the very policies she is tasked with imposing on Federal agencies.\u201d[20]/nIn August 2022, the National Academy of Sciences stated, \"[e]ffective August 8, for a five-year period, the NAS Council has barred Jane Lubchenco from being involved in NAS publications; serving on or participating in NAS and NRC program activities; and receiving NAS honors or awards.\" The publication Axios noted, the ban \"stems from section 3 of its code of conduct. It states that members \"shall avoid those detrimental research practices that are clear violations of the fundamental tenets of research.\"[21]/nThroughout her career, Lubchenco has emphasized the responsibilities scientists have to society and the importance of effective communication between scientists and society. In her 1997 address as President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, she focused on scientists'  \"social contract\"[22][23][24] with society, i.e. their obligation to not only create new knowledge that is helpful to society but also to share that knowledge widely, not just with other scientists. She created three organizations devoted to helping scientists become better communicators. In 1998 and 1999, respectively, she founded the Aldo Leopold Leadership Program (now the Earth Leadership Program) and COMPASS that train scientists to communicate their research more effectively to citizens, the media, policymakers and business leaders.[25] In 2007, Lubchenco co-founded Climate Central, a not-for-profit, non-advocacy organization whose mission is to communicate the science of climate change to U.S. audiences in a manner that is understandable, relevant, credible and useful./nLubchenco builds bridges between the scientific community and the general public through her public lectures (e.g. National Academy of Science Public Welfare Medal lecture), writing (e.g. Frontiers in Ecology editorial), and service to various scientific, non-governmental and governmental organizations. She has been a member of the Pew Oceans Commission, the Joint Oceans Commission Initiative, the Aspen Institute Arctic Commission, and the Council of Advisors for Google Ocean.[7]/nLubchenco has served the scientific community through leadership in numerous professional societies. She was president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS; 1997\u20138), the International Council for Science (ICSU; 2002\u20135), and the Ecological Society of America (1992\u201393).[13] She served two terms as a Presidentially nominated, Senate-confirmed Member of the National Science Board (1996-2006) and was elected to the Council of the National Academy of Sciences and appointed to its executive committee. She has been on the editorial boards of many of the major journals in her field./nLubchenco led the effort of the Ecological Society of America to identify scientific research priorities (biodiversity, climate change and sustainability science); this effort, called the Sustainable Biosphere Initiative (SBI), charted a new course for the professional scientific society toward more use-inspired science. The SBI connected the dots between seemingly esoteric research topics and real-world environmental problems, demonstrating the relevance and importance of ecological science.[26]/nLubchenco co-founded a research/monitoring/communications collaboration that sought to understand how the near-shore portion of the large marine ecosystem off the coasts of Washington, Oregon and California works and is changing, with an eye to improving management and policy.  This collaboration across four universities (Oregon State University, University of California at Santa Cruz, Stanford University, University of California at Santa Barbara), called the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) provided a new model for conducting ecosystem-wide research in which each university would conduct the same basic monitoring and research for its portion of the shoreline, allowing greater comparability and power across the entire system. Findings from the PISCO team have been used by managers and policy makers,[27] to understand the emergence of new \"dead zones,\" and the impacts of climate change, ocean acidification, and sea star wasting disease off Washington and Oregon.[28] Further, the findings have been used to inform selection criteria for networks of marine reserves and Marine Protected Areas in California, Washington, and Oregon./nLubchenco led an influential study of the science of marine reserves (also called 'no-take' marine protected areas) \u2013 areas of the ocean protected from any extractive or destructive activities.[29] The study showed that reserves result in significant increases in abundance, size and diversity of species within the reserve, and that some of this bounty spills over to the area outside the reserve. This study also proposed the concept of 'networks' of reserves \u2013 reserves within a large marine ecosystem that are connected by the movement of juveniles or adults. In 1997 at the AAAS Annual Meeting, she famously proposed the '20% by 2020' phrase \u2013 that 20% of the world's oceans be protected in marine reserves by the year 2020 to draw attention to the urgent need to protect and restore the health of our oceans (see The Controversy over Marine Protected Areas: Science meets Policy). This proposal and other efforts to promote marine reserves have attracted both controversy and resistance from those who wish to keep extracting resources from oceans. More recently, where fishermen have exclusive rights to fish along the margins of marine reserves, and thus benefit from the bounty spilling out from the reserve, they have championed establishment of more reserves.[30] As part of the ongoing efforts to promote marine reserves, Lubchenco established the Science of Marine Reserves project\u2014an international collaboration within PISCO to study, synthesize, and share information on MPAs globally\u2014in 2005. Dr. Lubchenco currently oversees these efforts and is an active contributor to MPA research and discussions. She was part of a study on the potential of well-managed marine reserves to mitigate and promote climate change adaptation by limiting direct anthropogenic stressors, enabling species recovery, and restoring habitat complexity.[31] More recently, she and her collaborators provided a novel approach to reconcile multiple goals for MPAs: biodiversity protection, food production, and climate mitigation.[32]/nLubchenco is currently working on an international collaboration to bring clarity and transparency to global MPA design and reporting. This effort, known as The MPA Guide, clarifies the four Stages of Implementation of MPAs (Proposed/Committed, Designated, Implemented and Actively Managed); four Levels of Protection (Fully Protected, Highly Protected, Lightly Protected and Minimally Protected); and the outcomes that can be expected from different types of MPAs, as long as Enabling Conditions are in place./nLubchenco served as Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)  from 2009 to 2013. She was nominated by President-Elect Barack Obama as a part of his new \"Science Team\" in December 2008, confirmed by the Senate on March 19, 2009, and sworn in on March 20, 2009. To introduce her to his Senate colleagues for her confirmation hearing, Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) called Lubchenco 'the bionic woman of good science.'.[33] She served as Administrator for nearly four years until her resignation on February 27, 2013./nNOAA is the nation's top science agency for climate, weather, and oceans. As head of NOAA, Lubchenco oversaw a staff of 12,800 employees, a budget of ca $5 billion, and ensured NOAA carried out its mission \"To understand and predict changes in climate, weather, oceans, and coasts, to share that knowledge and information with others, and to conserve and manage coastal and marine ecosystems and resources.\".[34] Lubchenco is both the first woman and the first marine ecologist to occupy the post. During her tenure at NOAA, she helped guide the nation through disasters such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and some of the most severe weather on record.[35] She also oversaw the formulation of NOAA's first scientific integrity policy, the implementation of Congress' instructions to end overfishing in U.S. waters by having management plans for every fishery, the restructuring of the program responsible for building the next generation of weather satellites, and assisted with the creation of the first National Ocean Policy for the United States./nNOAA's ability to provide services and stewardship depends on having credible scientific information and good scientists.  Lubchenco helped to strengthen science in the agency in a number of ways. First, the position of Chief Scientist, previously vacant for 16 years, was reinstated, although the Senate did not act to confirm the President's nominee at this time. Second, NOAA doubled the number of senior scientist positions, and created a scientific Council of Fellows. Third, under her leadership, NOAA created its first Scientific Integrity Policy. The Scientific Integrity Policy allows NOAA scientists to speak freely to the media and public, and forbids the manipulation, suppression, distortion and misuse of science in the agency.[36] Early in President Obama's administration, he charged agencies with establishing strong scientific integrity policies that would 'return science to its rightful place' in government.[37] NOAA's Scientific Integrity Policy has been called the \"Platinum Standard\" for agency policies in protecting the rights of scientists to communicate freely and in ensuring policy makers will not suppress or modify scientific findings. In addition, a first-ever all-agency-scientist workshop was held to identify scientific priorities and ways to strengthen science at the agency.[38] This workshop helped form the foundation of NOAA's Next Generation Strategic Plan, which assesses the highest priority opportunities for NOAA to contribute to the advancement of society.[39]/nOn April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig off the coast of Louisiana unexpectedly exploded, causing oil to freely flow into the Gulf of Mexico for the next 87 days. NOAA was one of the lead agencies responsible for responding to the oil spill. Lubchenco led NOAA's response and coordination with 13 other agencies. NOAA provided data from satellites, planes, ships and buoys, and on-the-ground scientists to help track the oil and forecast where it would go; local weather forecasts to inform responders; scientific advice to the U.S. Coast Guard who is in charge of an oil spill in U.S. waters; kept seafood safe by closing fisheries in U.S. waters when oil was present or expected to be present; developed protocols with other agencies to reopen closed areas; protected endangered species such as turtles; and evaluated the impact of the spill on the natural resources of the Gulf and the public's access to them. Lubchenco was frequently interviewed by the media as a federal science expert, and helped disseminate the working knowledge of the response to the public.[40] NOAA scientists and their academic partners continue to analyze and monitor the effects of the spill on the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem where both offshore and nearshore organisms and habitats were impacted.[41][42] Despite measures to reduce coastal oiling, approximately 2100\u00a0km of nearshore and coastal habitats were affected.[43]/nOn April 4, 2016 a Federal District judge approved a $20.8 billion settlement between the U.S. and five Gulf States and BP making the civil lawsuit over the Deepwater Horizon oil spill the largest environmental damage settlement with a single entity in U.S. history.[44] Of this settlement amount, up to $8.8 billion was allocated toward natural resource damages.[45][46][47]/nLubchenco helped craft the United States' National Ocean Policy, a document that provides a science-based blueprint for managing the U.S.'s oceans, coasts and Great Lakes to help mitigate conflicts between different ocean users (fishermen, shippers, natural resource managers, etc.) and ensure an overarching focus on good stewardship. She actively participated in the President's Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force and attended all of the six regional meetings across the country to gather stakeholder input. Recommendations of this Task Force were adopted by President Obama as the nation's first formal policy on oceans on July 19, 2010.[48][49] While environmental groups, federal and state lawmakers, and federal agency officials applauded the policy, some lawmakers and members of industry felt that it would provide too much regulation. Despite some opposition, on April 16, 2013, the Obama administration laid out an implementation plan for the National Ocean Policy to put into practice the recommendations laid out in the policy.[50][51][52] Since that time, the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Regional Planning Bodies have completed new Regional Ocean Plans (Northeast Plan, Mid-Atlantic Plan) for which they were awarded the 2017 Excellence in Solutions Peter Benchley Ocean Award./nIn 2006, Congress re-authorized the Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA), the regulatory law for the U.S. fisheries in federal waters. Sustainable fisheries are critical for ensuring sustainable coastal economies and livelihoods. Under the MSA, NOAA was directed to end overfishing by 2010 by having a management plan for each federally managed fishery. Lubchenco led NOAA's efforts to develop MSA management plans, which specify annual catch limits and accountability measures for each fishery.  As of July 2011, in collaboration with the Fishery Management Councils in each region, NOAA completed this task.  Lubchenco's support for limiting fishing in coastal communities led to some Congressmen calling for her resignation.[14, 16] Creating catch limits is often controversial, but thanks to these plans and their enforcement, overfishing is ending in U.S. waters and many depleted fisheries are recovering. According to NOAA, 2012 had the lowest number of stocks on the overfishing list and 32 stocks have been rebuilt since 2000, most within the last few years, creating more sustainable fishing opportunities and healthy ecosystems.[53] In an email to NOAA employees, Lubchenco listed \"ending over-fishing, rebuilding depleted stocks, and returning fishing to profitability\" as a major accomplishment of NOAA during her tenure.\"[54]/nUnder Lubchenco's leadership, NOAA also pursued use of 'catch shares' as a viable fishery management tool for appropriate fisheries.  Although catch shares have been used since 1990 in the U.S., scientific evidence about their merits suggests that the wider use of catch shares may benefit many other fisheries, making them once again profitable and sustainable. Science magazine quoted Lubchenco on catch shares, saying:/nRecent scientific analyses show us that fisheries managed with catch share programs perform better than fisheries managed with traditional tools. Even in the first years after implementation, catch share fisheries are stable, and even increase their productivity ... I see catch shares as the best way for many fisheries to both meet the Magnuson mandates and have healthy, profitable fisheries that are sustainable.[55]/nIn 2010, after extensive consultation with regional fishery management councils, NOAA adopted its National Catch Share Policy, which encourages the use of catch shares where appropriate.  Although critics asserted that NOAA imposed catch shares on fisheries, the policy makes it clear that they are not required, nor are they appropriate for every fishery.  NOAA's Catch Share Policy remains controversial, with critics asserting it cuts jobs for fishermen and takes away money from small coastal economies.[56] However, many coastal economies are beginning to embrace this type of fisheries management and, with the help of NOAA, are implementing a catch share-based system.[57]  During the four years Lubchenco was at NOAA, the number of catch share programs grew from 5 to 15.  In most of those programs, profitability is up, innovation by fishermen has increased and discards are down./nDuring Lubchenco's tenure, NOAA's law enforcement program came under fire.  After hearing from fishermen and members of Congress about problems, she requested a review of the program from the Department of Commerce Inspector General. The problems identified by the review were addressed when Lubchenco initiated a top-to-bottom overhaul of the program, including improvements to policy for assessing penalties, limited use of civil funds, updates to its National and Division Enforcement Priorities with stakeholder input, and a plan to create enforcement positions that better ensure compliance. As these changes were being implemented, additional past problems came to light, triggering additional reforms./nLubchenco also pushed for greater attention to recreational fishing.[58][59]\nShe created a new position at NOAA to oversee and represent saltwater fishing interests, called for a Saltwater Recreational Fishing Summit,[60] met with recreational fishing groups frequently, and increased data collection about recreational fisheries to provide a better basis for management.  Despite significant progress, many recreational fishing organizations continue to express distrust and unhappiness with Lubchenco in particular and NOAA in general./nOn the international front, Lubchenco increased the number of efforts aimed at addressing overfishing and illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing on the high seas. She teamed up with the Commissioner of Fisheries for the European Union, Maria Damanaki to initiate a more serious effort to address illegal fishing and level the playing field for law-abiding fishermen.[61][62] Lubchenco worked to see international treaties on IUU fishing approved and strengthened the use of science and precaution in making decisions by regional fishery management organizations.[63][64] Specifically, during her tenure as NOAA Administrator, the Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA) to Prevent, Deter, and Eliminate IUU Fishing through the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization was finalized and went into effect. As of August 2019, 50 countries have signed the agreement.[65]/nProviding data, services and products related to forecasting a changing climate is a main priority for NOAA scientists.  Lubchenco strengthened these efforts. One of her initial goals was to establish the National Climate Service, which would have re-organized NOAA to better provide climate services and products to the public13. However, congressional opposition prevented the budget-neutral re-organization from moving forward. Nonetheless, responding to increasing demands for climate services, under Lubchenco's leadership, NOAA initiated a number of steps.  Climate.gov was created in 2012 as a \"one-stop shop\" for climate information.  In 2011 NOAA signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Western Governors' Association to provide western states with a range of climate services, for example information about impending drought.[66][67] She said, \"Creating a new generation of climate services to promote public understanding, support mitigation and adaptation efforts, enable smart planning, and promote regional climate partnerships\"[54] were some of the things she was most proud of during her tenure./nDuring her time, NOAA also led federal agency efforts to develop the most ambitious National Climate Assessment ever conducted./nFrom 2009 to 2013, the nation experienced some of the most extreme weather on record. NOAA delivered life-saving forecasts for 770 tornadoes, 70 Atlantic hurricanes/tropical storms, 6 major floods, 3 tsunamis, historic drought, prolonged heat waves, record snowfall/blizzard.[68] Dr. Lubchenco has said that \"bizarre, crazy weather\" came to define her term as NOAA Administrator.[35][69]/nIn 2011, NOAA's National Weather Service, the source of all official weather warnings and the main weather forecasting body in the country, decided it could no longer gauge its performance by the accuracy and timeliness of its forecast \u2013 it needed to also understand how effective these were at getting people to respond. Under the lead of Dr. Lubchenco, NOAA launched the \"Weather-Ready Nation\" initiative in the summer of 2011 to help build resilience and improve on-the-ground response to extreme weather and water events.  In March 2011, NOAA initiated the nation's most ambitious upgrading of its weather radar network, converting all of its 160 radar sites to dual polarization technology, which vastly improves the accuracy and timeliness of forecasts related to weather and water activity.[70]/nIn late October 2012, Hurricane Sandy hit the east coast of the United States, devastating communities across the eastern seaboard and west to Michigan and Wisconsin. NOAA technology and scientists helped to accurately predict the path of the storm, allowing on-the-ground warnings to be issued in time to save lives.[71]/nOn March 11, 2011, the large Tohoku earthquake occurred off the coast of Japan, which was the precursor to the devastating Fukushima earthquake one month later. NOAA was involved in predicting where radioactive material and marine debris would go, how the currents would carry the material, and helping coastal states and communities prepare for dealing with the debris when it arrived./nOn December 4, 2014, Lubchenco was appointed the U.S. Department of State's first Science Envoy for the Ocean (SEO) by Secretary of State John Kerry.[72] As SEO, Dr. Lubchenco's mission was to integrate scientific knowledge with the creation of sustainable solutions that improve global relationships, ocean health, and thus the well-being of human communities around the world. Following discussions with the Department of State, Lubchenco chose six developing countries in Africa and Asia to focus her ocean diplomacy work (South Africa, Seychelles, Mauritius, Indonesia, and China).[73] The year-long tenure of science envoys required Lubchenco be strategic\u2014relying on targeted information and guidance and working closely with key stakeholders\u2014to realize the specific goals of each region. Serving from 2015 to 2016, Lubchenco fostered a dialogue between local communities, resource users and managers, government officials, non-governmental organizations, and academics to build upon initiatives that connect science to effective policy and management. Some of the key issue areas for Lubchenco as the SEO included ocean acidification, climate change adaptation and mitigation, sustainable fisheries, aquaculture, marine spatial planning, and marine protected areas. She applied information and experiences gained as a \u2018global diplomat for the ocean\u2019 to advise the White House, State Department, and U.S. science community.[73][74]/nLubchenco's inaugural trip as SEO was in July 2015 to South Africa, Mauritius, and Seychelles. Dr. Lubchenco's SEO efforts in Seychelles,[74] South Africa, and Mauritius led to the formal establishment of the Forum on African Marine Science and helped build support for a landmark deal to expand marine protection and create dedicated funding for climate adaptation in Seychelles.[73] Led by the U.S. based Nature Conservancy and the government of Seychelles, the deal had Seychelles protect 30% of its ocean territory in exchange for the cancellation of $30 million in debt by foreign investor group.[75] It was the first ever debt-for-nature swap in the ocean./nIn 2016, Lubchenco continued her work as SEO, travelling to China and Indonesia. In China, Dr. Lubchenco helped promote the establishment of a new US \u2013 China Joint Scientific Experts Group to operate under the established \u201cSOA-NOAA Joint Working Group on Cooperation on Marine and Fishery Science and Technology\u201d and extend the US-China Framework Plan for Ocean and Fishery Science and Technology Cooperation that was in effect 2011\u20132015.[76] In Indonesia, Lubchenco helped facilitate the creation of a working partnership between Indonesian Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries and UC Santa Barbara scientists to help build technical capacity for fisheries management in Indonesia that is informed by good science. More specifically, the Sustainable Fisheries Group works to \u201canalyze the potential benefits of fishery reform in Indonesia and evaluate the impacts of recent IUU efforts.\u201d/nLubchenco is an elected member of:/nHer teaching, scientific achievements and work in furthering communication between science and the public have brought numerous honors, including:/nAccording to the Institute for Scientific Information, twelve of Lubchenco's numerous scientific papers have been cited so many times in other scientific publications they are considered 'science citation classic papers' or 'top 0.25% papers'. These papers report novel findings about the factors determining local and global patterns of distribution, abundance and diversity of species on rocky sea shores, interactions between people and nature, the importance of no-take marine protected areas and the responsibilities of scientists to society. The twelve classic papers are:/nMost of Lubchenco's earlier research concentrated on local ecological patterns of rocky sea shores and their causes; her later research looks at ocean ecosystems more broadly \u2013 how they work, how they are changing and implications for policy and management.

Shortly after passing his Abitur examinations at an English high school in Prague, Hermann Levinson fled to Haifa (at that time, British Mandate of Palestine). He reached the coast of Haifa, and was met by British officials who transferred him to a French warship named Patria. This ship was eventually blown up by unknown offenders on 25 November 1940 near Haifa. The survivors of shipwreck were rescued by British soldiers, received the status of \"enemy alien\u201c and were retained in the detention camp of Atlit (approx. 20\u00a0km south of Haifa).

In 1953 and 1956 he completed his master's and doctorate programs at the University of Michigan and then proceeded with postdoctoral research at Yale University and the University of Montreal. Martin's early interest embraced ornithology and herpetology and he conducted extensive fieldwork from 1948 to 1953 in Tamaulipas, Mexico.[5][6] He published biogeographies on the birds of the Sierra de Tamaulipas[7] and the herpetofauna of the G\u00f3mez Farias (= El Cielo) region of Tamaulipas,[8] the latter considered \"a classic treatise in historical biogeography\".[9] A case of polio, contracted while doing undergraduate field work in Mexico, forced Martin to rely on a cane, which restricted but did not end his field work.[10] He joined the faculty of the University of Arizona in 1957, maintaining his office (and his ongoing collaborations and regional fieldwork) at the university's Desert Laboratory when he became emeritus professor in 1989.[11]/nThe overkill hypothesis was proposed in 1966 by Paul S. Martin[15] in a paper published in the journal Nature.[16] Martin wrote, \"The chronology of the extinction \u2014 first in Africa, second in America, finally in Madagascar \u2014 and the intensity of the extinction \u2014 moderate in Africa, heavier in America, and extremely heavy in Madagascar ... seems clearly related to the spread of human beings, to their cultural development, and to the vulnerabilities of the faunas they encountered.\"[17]/nMartin theorized that between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago newly arriving humans hunted to extinction North America's Ice Age large mammals, including ground sloths,[18] camels,[19] mammoths and mastodons.[11] The theory, summarized by Martin for a scientific audience in 1973[3] and in his 2005 book, Twilight of the Mammoths: Ice Age Extinctions and the Rewilding of America,[20] has been controversial and thus widely examined (both criticized and supported) in academic papers.[21] From the outset, Martin pointed to the asynchronous timing of megafaunal extinctions in different locales \u2014 especially when paired with time of first arrival of humans.[11] (See the two images at right.) Five years before his death, Martin was still collaborating with colleagues on the timing data. He joined with David W. Steadman and six additional authors in a 2005 paper titled \"Asynchronous Extinction of Late Quaternary Sloths\non Continents and Islands.\"[22]/nEarly critics of the overkill hypothesis were researchers in the field of archaeology (Louis Leakey and Donald Grayson[23]) and the geosciences (Russell Graham). The former focused on disagreements about human capabilities and expansions out of Africa. In geosciences, the focus was on the scale, speed, ecological effects, and biodiversity consequences of climate change during the Pleistocene glacial and interglacial periods. Prior to Martin's overkill idea, the mainstream scientific understanding of Pleistocene and Holocene extinction causes was climate change.[24][17]/nMartin later developed an ancillary hypothesis focusing on the speed of human entry into and saturation of a frontier landscape. This, he called the \u201cblitzkrieg model\u201d,[25] which, similar to the ideas of Russian climatologist Mikhail I. Budyko,[26] relates the sudden demise of large mammal populations on different continents and at different times to the arrival of humans. Martin proposed that as humans migrated from Africa and Eurasia to Australia, the Americas, and the islands of the Pacific, the new arrivals rapidly hunted to extinction the large animals endemic to each continent and thus also naive in the presence of unfamiliar primates equipped with lethal projectiles. Martin particularly focused his research on North America, whose late Ice Age fauna rivaled that of Africa today.[27]/nFor the first several decades of scientific debate about the overkill hypothesis, Martin faced substantial criticism from archaeologists and paleontologists who claimed earlier dates for human arrival in the Americas[28][29] or later dates for certain extinct animals than the overkill theory would suggest. Martin maintained that such claims were the result of faulty scientific analysis and pointed out that no such dates had yet been independently verified.[30] By 2015, five years after Martin died, radiocarbon dates had been compiled and refined to such an extent that a group of scientists concluded, \"Our results, based on analyses of radiocarbon dates from Eastern Beringia, the contiguous United States, and South America, suggest north to south, time, and space transgressive declines in megafaunal populations as predicted by the overkill hypothesis. This finding is difficult to reconcile with other extinction hypotheses.\"[24]/nThe overkill hypothesis is thus far less controversial today than it was when first proposed.[31][32] Overall, when climate is invoked as a causal factor of megafaunal extinctions, it is no longer portrayed as the only cause. For example, in 2010 a paper that focused on the timing of megafaunal extinctions and human occupation within South America concluded, \"This pattern suggests that a synergy of human impacts and rapid climate change\u2014analogous to what is happening today\u2014may enhance extinction probability.\"[33] And in 2012 the authors of a paper published in Nature Communications concluded, \"Mammoth extinction was not due to a single cause, but followed a long trajectory in concert with changes in climate, habitat, and human presence.\"[34]/nMore than a half century after Martin's first publication on the overkill hypothesis, a new line of evidence emerged that offered strong support. Researchers focusing entirely on genetic analyses of surviving megafaunal populations \u2014 rather than paleontological evidence of extinct megafauna \u2014 concluded: \"The inability of climate to predict the observed population decline of megafauna, especially during the past 75,000 years, implies that human impact became the main driver of megafauna dynamics around this date.\"[35]/nMartin also championed the concept of Pleistocene rewilding[37][38][39] in which megafauna of the Pleistocene epoch that vanished in North America during the Holocene extinction could be restored by establishing breeding populations of close relatives from other continents. These could include large herbivores, such as llamas, camels, rhinoceros, and elephants, as well as lost carnivores that still reside in Africa: lions and cheetahs.[40][41][42] To restore the megafaunal browsing function lost in North America when its mastodons and mammoths went extinct, \"Bring Back the Elephants\" was the title of a 1999 advocacy essay that he (with coauthor David A. Burney) published in Wild Earth magazine.[43]/nPrior to invention of the term rewilding and the beginnings of advocacy for it by conservation biologists, Martin had already proposed in 1969[19] and 1970[44] that large mammal equivalents from Africa and Asia be introduced into western North America. Their ecological function would be to restore native grasslands on which shrubs were becoming dominant \u2014 especially where cattle were grazed on semi-arid and arid landscapes in which large carnivores were rare or eliminated. In his 1969 article, Martin proposed reintroducing into North America a dry-adapted browser that had been on this continent for millions of years but vanished after humans arrived. This was the camel. To support his proposal, Martin called upon paleontological evidence that the camel family, Camelidae, actually originated in North America. He also quoted from the journal of an army officer, George Beal, who in 1857 drove a herd of domesticated camels through Texas and Arizona, destined for California. Beal reported that the camels not only would eat plants that cattle could not, but that the camels seemed to prefer thorny shrubs and \"bitter herbs.\"[19] In Martin's 1970 article, his abstract drew upon paleontological evidence of other native species now extinct in North America whose ancestors had evolved millions of years earlier on other continents:/n\"Eleven thousand years ago in North America a major biotic catastrophe resulted in the extinction of 70% of the mammalian megafauna. In the arid Southwest, domestic livestock imperfectly fill the vacated ecological niches. The experimental introduction of modern African animals can be advocated on the grounds that many of the native American mammals were themselves late Pleistocene immigrants from Asia.\"[44]/nIn 1992 he published a broader advocacy piece,[45] which blended scientific argument with poetic appeal. Linking the title of his essay, \"The Last Entire Earth\", to a phrase and sentiment expressed by Henry David Thoreau, Martin followed with:/n\"This, then, is our birthright, a continent whose wilderness once echoed to the thunder of many mighty beasts, a fauna that eclipsed all that remains, including the wild animals of Yellowstone and Denali. Those who ignore the giant ground sloths, native horses, and saber tooth cats in their vision of outdoor America sell the place short, it seems to me. This land is the mastodon's land. While \"Home on the Range\" commemorates buffalo, deer, and antelope, it misses the mammoth, glyptodonts, and camels.\"[45]/n\"Without knowing it, Americans live in a land of ghosts,\" Paul S. Martin wrote on the first page of his final book,Twilight of the Mammoths (2005), whose subtitle linked \"ice age extinctions\" with a need for \"rewilding of America\".[20]/nMartin had long pointed out the ecological costs in North America of the recent loss of browsing megafauna in the early part of the Holocene. He attributed the ongoing incursion of shrubs into native grasslands to the absence of browsing herbivores, especially in the context of introduced grazing cattle largely protected from the continent's large carnivores who remained.[19][44] It was the ecologist Daniel H. Janzen who, in the late 1970s, prompted Martin to apply his paleoecological knowledge and perspective to an additional form of ecological loss stemming from that extinction. This was the loss of animal partners that had coevolved with particular plants in dispersing seeds. Megafauna were able to swallow large fruits without spitting out or damaging the contained seeds. Hours or days later, those seeds would be deposited not only at substantial distances away from the parent plant, but also in fertile mounds of dung.[47]/nA 1982 paper published in a prominent academic journal was the outcome of Martin's collaboration with Janzen.[47] Titled \"Neotropical Anachronisms: The Fruits the Gomphotheres Ate,\" this paper introduced a new concept in ecology: \"evolutionary anachronism\", also known as \"ecological anachronism\".[46] (Gomphotheres were an extinct form of elephant that lived in tropical zones of the Western Hemisphere prior to the arrival of humans.) The history of Martin's collaboration with Janzen and the impact that made in the ecological and botanical sciences were the subjects of a 2001 book by science writer Connie Barlow, titled The Ghosts of Evolution: Nonsensical Fruit, Missing Partners, and Other Ecological Anachronisms.[46] Martin contributed the book's foreword.[48] The species of anachronistic fruits that Barlow featured in her book included all those (and more) of temperate climate ecosystems in North America that Janzen and Martin recommended for study in the final paragraph of their \"Neotropical anachronisms\" paper:/n\"Our discussion has focused on neotropical plants and animals, but it can be generalized to the sweet-fleshed large fruits of the Kentucky coffeebean Gymnocladus dioica and honey locust Gleditsia triacanthos (Leguminaceae), osage orange Maclura (Moraceae), pawpaw Asimina triloba (Annonaceae), and persimmon Diospyros (Ebenaceae).\"/nIn 2004, Paul Martin played a role in launching a new controversy in conservation biology called  assisted migration. Wild Earth magazine published in its forum section a pair of pro and con essays debating the topic of \"Assisted Migration for an Endangered Tree\".[50] Science writer Connie Barlow joined Martin in writing the pro position: \"Bring Torreya taxifolia North \u2014 Now\".[51] The oppositional case was presented by Mark W. Schwartz, professor at the University of California, Davis, who argued \"Conservationists Should Not Move Torreya taxifolia\".[52]/nBoth sides agreed that this ancient conifer was a glacial relict, having shifted southward during the glaciations but unable to disperse its large seed northward during the Holocene. Both sides also recognized the seriousness of intentionally moving this species northward, given that additional climate warming expected in the future might amplify calls for moving many other plants, too. Whether to act now or to engage in further scientific scrutiny and consultation was where the two sides differed. Barlow and Martin's final paragraph:/n\"'Left behind in near time' may thus be a syndrome that applies to a number of extinct, imperiled, and soon-to-be imperiled plants, and perhaps to small, isolated populations of species that are not themselves in danger of extinction. How might this awareness alter our conservation options as climate shifts? By assisting the migration of Torreya taxifolia now, we can help to shape a better next chapter for this beleaguered tree and, perhaps, many other plants.\"/nA citizen group organized and began to act soon after the forum essays were published in Wild Earth. These Torreya Guardians have been called a \"rogue\" group for not following the guidelines of the International Union for Conservation of Nature.[53] And yet, a 2017 editorial within a leading international journal, Nature, characterized the group's actions in this way, \"In one of the only real-world examples of assisted migration so far, campaigners have planted the seeds of the critically endangered conifer Torreya taxifolia hundreds of miles north of its Florida home.\"[54]/nThe University of Arizona, where Paul S. Martin served as professor (and emeritus) until his death in 2010, published an obituary that included quotations from some of his colleagues and former students at the university.

She is best known for her work on the control of many epidemics including: typhoid fever, cholera, dysentery, and smallpox.[1] Throughout the 1920s, Sparrow worked with the Polish Armed Forces at the State Institute of Hygiene in Warsaw. While at the State Institute of Hygiene, she worked vigilantly to produce the first vaccine against typhus and ran several large-scale vaccination campaigns to control the spread of diphtheria and scarlet fever all along the eastern frontiers of Poland.[1] In 1933, Sparrow began to study flea-borne and louse-borne rickettsia diseases in Tunis, where she became the head of her own department at the Pasteur Institute. In her later years, she expanded her studies to include Mexico and Guatemala. While in Mexico and Guatemala, Sparrow developed a protective vaccine against typhus.[1] She contributed a great amount of research to the World Health Organization on relapsing fever specifically in Ethiopia.[1]/nSparrow was born on 5 June 1891 in Bohuslav, Kiev Governorate. Her parents married in 1890. Her mother was  X. Stefanska (b. c 1870) and  her father Leopold Sparrow (born c. 1860) was a magistrate of English origin.[2] She was educated at a secondary school in Kiev, gaining a gold medal[2] and then attended the Faculty of Medicine in Kiev, obtaining a medical diploma (cum laude) in 1915.[3] She obtained a second degree in medicine from University of Pozna\u0144 in 1923. She obtained her doctorate in 1928 from the University of Warsaw.[4]/nIn 1915 she became involved in the control of epidemic disease within the Russian army during the First World War. Once fighting ended, she began working in clinics in Dorpat (now Tartu, Estonia), supervised by Professor Bylina, soon moving to the Institute of Bacteriology in Kiev as an assistant to Wolodymyr Lindeman. She began to work on epidemic typhus with Oleksii Krontovski and L. Polev. In 1920 she went to Warsaw to work with Dr Ludwik Rajchman, the Director of the State Institute of Hygiene.[3] In 1922 she was appointed Chief of Service and then in 1928 became the Chief of the Preventative Vaccinations Service. This included organising vaccination campaigns and also investigation of cholera outbreaks. She obtained a second medical degree from University of Pozna\u0144 in 1923. Between 1921 and 1933 she also worked with Rudolf Weigl at the University of Lw\u00f3w on epidemic typhus.[4] During this time she was involved in setting up four public health laboratories in eastern Poland to benefit people relocated following national boundary changes as well as supervising large-scale programmes of vaccination against diphtheria and scarlet fever in the Warsaw region, supported by Robert Debr\u00e9.[4] She obtained her first tenured academic post in 1928 as an associate professor in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Warsaw, presenting her doctoral thesis on Probl\u00e8mes de la vaccination contre le typhus exanth\u00e9matique (The problems of vaccinations against exanthematic typhus)[3] and was subsequently the Professor of Bacteriology.

In 1924 she was again sent to France for training in microbiology at the Pasteur Institute and in the laboratory of Alexandre Besredka. There she met Charles Nicolle during his annual conference on typhus, changing the course of her life.[6]/nSparrow and Nicolle began working together, with their main studies being focused on typhus, specifically the ways in which it spread and how to create a vaccine to limit the contagion. At the beginning of the 20th century, little was known about epidemic typhus. The only known facts about typhus was that it was a dangerous and deadly disease that spread rapidly amongst dense populations, with its principal factors for transmission being dirty clothing and overcrowding.[7] In September 1909, Nicolle and Sparrow made the discovery that lice were the primary vectors for typhus.[7] This discovery came after observing typhus patients in Tunis. Nicolle stated that patients infected others on the street as well as hospital personnel working with dirty laundry, but once patients were admitted to the hospital and given a hot bath and clean clothing, they ceased to be infectious.[7] This observation led Nicolle and Sparrow to look closer at the lice, as these were suspected to be responsible for transmitting typhus. For three months, Nicolle and Sparrow tested their lice transmission theory in the laboratory by injecting an uninfected chimpanzee with blood from a patient infected with typhus and letting lice feed on this now infected host.[7] After a couple of days, the lice were transferred to a healthy chimpanzee to allow them to feed on an uninfected host. The second chimpanzee soon contracted typhus, resulting in a positive correlation between lice and the transmission of typhus.[7] The first step in the search for a vector for transmission of typhus was complete, but there were many challenges ahead. Nicolle and Sparrow now aimed to produce a vaccine. In 1925, the Pasteur Institute financed her research with Nicolle into epidemic typhus in Tunisia. While searching for a vaccine against typhus, Nicolle and Sparrow encountered many obstacles. Initially, Nicolle and Sparrow mixed typhus bacilli with blood serum from recovered patients.[7] This mixture aided in keeping Nicolle himself in good health, but unfortunately fell short when trying to cure patients who were already infected with typhus.[8]/nIn 1931, she was sent by the government, along with Charles Nicolle, to study epidemic typhus in Mexico and Guatemala, where they administered their typhus serum to the public.[1] In 1932, Sparrow and Nicolle turned their attention to the Weigl vaccine.[9] Rudolf Weigl had developed a technique for a typhus vaccine that involved producing numerous infected lice and then grinding them to create a vaccine paste.[7] After Nicolle's death in 1936, Sparrow continued her research into a typhus vaccine. With her previous experience of the Weigl vaccine, Sparrow began to work exclusively on vaccines cultured in the lungs of small mammals.[9] This led to her 1935 research on murine viruses as a potential basis of an anti-typhoid vaccine. In 1940, Paul Durand and Sparrow teamed up and began work on new culturing methods for typhus rickettsiae.[9] It was through this partnership that they developed the Durand-Sparrow anti-typhoid vaccine.[9] Sparrow also worked to culture the agent of spotted fever as a prelude to a vaccine against Rocky Mountain spotted fever.[10]/nHer transfer of expertise in the laboratory culture of lice was important for progress against typhus at the Pasteur Institute in Tunis. This included development of a vaccine, trials of insecticides and isolation of bacteria that were the causal agents of typhus and typhus-like fevers.[6] She was allowed to continue working at the Pasteur Institute until 1961 as 'Chef de Service', beyond the compulsory retirement age and from 1949 was the Head of the vaccine service, immunizing against tuberculosis. From 1955 she was in charge of work on relapsing fever in Ethiopia for the World Health Organization.[3]/nShe married Baron Robert von Kuegelgen from Estonia[2] in 1917, a surgeon in the Russian army, but they eventually separated.[6] They had a daughter, Marie Bogna Seiler von Kugelgen.[3] She became a French national in 1933.[5] In October 1933 she married Phillippe Germa, an agriculturalist./nDuring the Second World War she hosted French refugees (including Andr\u00e9 Gide) and Polish deserters in Tunis. Gide arrived in December 1942 while it was occupied by German and Italian troops, remaining until May 1943 when French, British and American forces re-took the city and he was able to travel to Algiers. During this time he recorded in his journal that Sparrow was present at, or hosted, several lunch engagements for mutual friends within the French community.[11] Gide also recounts how Sparrow narrowly escaped death during bombing raids. On 1 January 1943, while she was in the building, a bomb fell on the ground-floor apartment where Sparrow lodged with the Boutelleau family, but it did not explode. Five days later, on 6 January, bombs destroyed two adjacent houses.[11]:\u200a146/nSparrow and her second husband planted an orange orchard together in Soukra, near Tunis.

Together with ophthalmologist Bob Wasserman and vision physiologist Ralph Siegel, he came to visit her and Ruggiero in February 2005, and in 2006 he published an article on their story in The New Yorker.[3][14]/nBarry had initially found it difficult to believe in her acquisition of stereo vision for the reason that the notion of critical period was firmly set since the groundbreaking work of Torsten Wiesel and David H. Hubel with deprivation experiments in which animals did not develop the neuronal basis for stereo vision if they were prevented from performing stereo fusion for a given time period after birth. Barry contacted Hubel, who had no difficulty in believing in her vision improvements and stated that their experiments in fact had not addressed the question whether the animals might have been able to recover stereo vision later.[15]/nHubel explained to me that he had never attempted to correct the strabismus in animals in order to examine the effects of straightening the eyes on visual circuitry. It would have been difficult to realign the eyes surgically and even harder to train the animals with vision therapy. So, he couldn't be sure that the effects of strabismus on binocular circuitry were permanent. Yet to truly delineate a critical period, he and other scientists would have had to demonstrate that the effects of strabismus on cortical wiring cannot be reversed after a certain age. Indeed, Hubel had already stated these concerns in Brain and Visual Perception when he wrote, \u201cA missing aspect of this work is knowledge of the time course of the strabismus animals, cats or monkeys, and in the monkeys the possibilities of recovery.\u201d/nSusan R.

She concludes:/nAfter the article on \"Stereo Sue\" was published, Barry found and took up contact with a number of persons who shared with her their own stories of lacking and acquiring stereo vision. She reports on their experiences at regaining 3D vision in her book Fixing my Gaze./nApart the cases recounted by Barry, further cases have been pointed out recently in which a formerly stereoblind adult has acquired the ability for stereopsis./nThis happened also to neuroscientist Bruce Bridgeman, professor of psychology and psychobiology at University of California Santa Cruz, who had grown up nearly stereoblind and acquired stereo vision spontaneously in 2012 at the age of 67, when watching the 3D movie Hugo with polarizing 3D glasses. The scene suddenly appeared to him in depth, and the ability to see the world in stereo stayed with him also after leaving the cinema.[17][18]/nThe Princeton Review lists Barry among the 300 outstanding college teachers in the U.S., her paper on the work of Frederick W.

Marrack notes that the longest she lived in one place during her early years was in Cambridge where she began pursuing her undergraduate degree.[4] After attending Cambridge University, Marrack moved to the United States to complete postdoctoral work and research. In the United States she met her lifelong partner and husband, John W. Kappler. They have completed much research and accomplished many advancements in the fields of immunology, biochemistry, and molecular biology.[5] Marrack and Kappler have two children together.[6] Outside of science, Philippa Marrack enjoys playing the piano, as well as running along the Platte River with her Labradors.[4]/nMarrack completed both undergraduate (1967) and Ph.D. (1970) at Cambridge University in New Hall, Cambridge. During her Ph.D., Marrack worked at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology with Alan Munro, where she began to study the differences between T cells and B cells. Alan Munro became her thesis advisor; she became the graduate student that worked with him due to his interest in working with a relative of John Marrack. John Marrack was Philippa Marrack's grandfather's brother, and a very well-known immunologist in the 1930s. Marrack notes that he indirectly influenced her to pursue the study of immunology.[4]/nMarrack then moved to La Jolla, San Diego with her first husband and completed postdoctoral work with Richard Dutton at the University of California, San Diego.[7] She credits Dutton as having a tremendous impact on her career during her fellowship, as he taught her how to write, lecture, and run a lab, as well as how to think critically.[4]/nMarrack met her lifelong partner and current husband, John W.

Marrack obtained an associate professorship at the University of Rochester, followed by faculty positions at the National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado and the University of Colorado Denver. She was also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.[9] Throughout her career, Marrack has published over 300 peer-reviewed journal articles. Her numerous citations and journal articles places her as the third most influential researcher in the nation and distinguishes her as top female researcher.[5]/nIn 1983 while working in the labs at the National Jewish Health in Denver, Colorado, Philippa Marrack and her husband and research partner, John Kappler, discovered and isolated the T cell receptor, together with Ellis Reinherz and James Allison. Resulting from this research, in 1987 Marrack discovered how the immune system is capable of molecular discrimination, as the human body can get rid of T cells that target the body's own tissues, destroying them in the thymus before they have a chance to cause problems, yet the body retains the cells that combat invaders. She learned that destructive cells that fail to be destroyed can cause autoimmune diseases like AIDS, diabetes, Multiple sclerosis, and lupus. This foundational work on immunological tolerance by Marrack and Kappler led to their later discovery in 1990 of superantigens: powerful toxins that stimulate a large amounts of T-cell proliferation and can cause devastating immune response and violent symptoms such as those seen in toxic shock syndrome or food poisoning.[5][10] Marrack's current research projects focus on why certain autoimmune diseases, like lupus or Multiple sclerosis, are more prevalent in women than in men. Marrack and Kappler have recently discovered a population of B cells that may account for some of this observation.[11] Her pioneering and revolutionary work isolating the T-cell receptor and describing how T cells protect against infection, drive autoimmune and allergic diseases, and play a possible role in rejection of cancers, has contributed greatly to the current understanding of vaccines, HIV, and immune disorders in the medical field./nMarrack has served on editorial boards and many scientific journals including Cell, Science, and the Journal of Immunology.

He has researched the nature of evolutionary transformations, and is widely published in the fields of phylogenetic tree, genetics and evolutionary biology. Penny's contributions to science have been recognised with several awards and honours, and acceptance into the National Academy of Sciences./nPenny attended New Plymouth Boys' High School before gaining undergraduate degrees in botany and chemistry at the University of Canterbury.  He completed his PhD in botany at Yale University in 1965 and later worked as a postdoctoral researcher at McMaster University.[5] He returned to New Zealand in 1966 and joined the staff at Massey University, within the Department of Plant Biology, School of Biological Sciences, Institute for Molecular BioSciences, and Institute of Fundamental Sciences and in 2005 Penny was named a Distinguished Professor.[5] From 2002 to 2010 Penny co-led the Allan Wilson Centre, one of the original New Zealand Centres of Research Excellence hosted at Massey University.  Until it closed in 2015, the centre had a focus on researching the evolution and ecology of New Zealand and Pacific plant and animal life.  After retiring in 2017 he became a Professor Emeritus.[5]/nHis research has focused on theoretical biology, molecular evolution, human evolution, and the history of science.[5]/nIn the 1970s Penny looked into how genetic information on all forms of life could be used to investigate questions such as the origin of life, the occurrence of evolution and the relationship between species and communities. He helped to develop \"mathematical techniques and computer programmes to analyse DNA sequences and construct evolutionary trees...[developing]... new insights that support the idea that humans evolved in and then migrated from Africa and that the first forms of life were based on the simpler RNA molecule rather than DNA\".[6][7] In 1998 he co-authored a paper providing compelling DNA-based evidence that the M\u0101ori migration to New Zealand included between 50 and 100 females, a finding noted by the authors as \"entirely consistent with M\u0101ori oral history as well as the results of recent canoe voyages recreating early trans-oceanic voyages\".[8]/nIt has been said that the paper Construction of Phylogentic Trees (1967)[9] was what first made Penny interested in tracing the process of evolution.[10] One of the authors of that paper, Walter Fitch, reflected in 1988 that the inspiration for their 1967 research was to develop a computer programme that would break the genetic code and develop a \"molecular paleontological record in proteins and nucleic acid\".[11] Penny's early research challenged the theories of evolution at the time. In looking to clarify a sound basis of classification, in 1982 he entered the controversy  about whether relationships between organisms should be expressed in \"evolutionary terms, or on clusters based on overall similarity\", and concluded that retaining the original data supported sound classification.[12]/nPenny was involved in research teams that explored tree building methods. In 1985, he collaborated on work that evaluated the reliability of these, and the research paper concluded that there needed to be a balance between the traditional approach of \"weighting the characters\" and a computer-based approach utilizing the growing awareness of numerical taxonomy.[13] Another paper in 1992, while noting at times the conventional methods were reliable, also presented a new approach.  This was known as LogDet and according to the authors of the paper, \"[allowed] tree-selection methods to consistently recover the correct tree when sequences evolve under simple asymmetric models...produce sequences of different nucleotide compositions...and are more realistic than most standard models\".[14] In 1993 he co-authored a research paper that took the position progress was being made with methods for evolutionary trees. In the Abstract, the authors explaind the signals of macromolecules from a common history and clarified the intention of the  research as being to discuss methods that were \"efficient (fast), consistent, powerful, robust, and falsifiable\", for inferring evolutionary trees from these patterns or signals. The paper concludeed that most methods of tree inference needed corrections, but \"the recognition that methods may be both efficient and consistent [was] also useful\".[15]/nA paper co-authored by Penny in 2006,[16] challenged the prevailing view at the time that eukaryotes had evolved by genome fusion between archaea and bacteria, suggesting they \"were more likely to have been reduced by sequence loss and cellular simplification after the possible emergence of a predatory eukaryote.[17]:\u200ap.12\u200a  This research was significant because it suggested that  modern eukaryote and prokaryote cells had long followed separate evolutionary trajectories, confirming \"that evolution does not proceed monotonically from the simpler to the more complex\".[16] Penny told NBC News the results may been surprising to some, but stressed that there was little evidence of the fusion theory explaining \"the special genetic and cellular features of the eukaryotes\". He suggested it was an example of evolution being \"backwards, sideways and occasionally forward\".[18] A group of international scientists disputed the findings in the 2006 paper. They claimed the writers had \"delivered biased opinions\" that presented \"an introns-early (and eukaryotes-first) view of early evolution that was current in 1980 and that was shown by conventional scientific criteria to be untenable over a decade ago\".[19]:\u200app.542-543\u200a In the same journal,  Penny et al. responded that new information from cellular and molecular genomics provided previously unavailable information on eukaryote origins. They agreed it was \"still premature to decide between introns first, early, or late...nevertheless, our primary conclusion is that there is good progress on understanding the complexity of the ancestral eukaryote cell\".[19]:\u200ap.543/nPenny was also part of a research team that explored theories for eukaryote origins and noted some of these ignore life history and ecological principles, and it was necessary to challenge predictions there was a long period in early life with no predators. The authors concluded that their results were \"consistent with the expectation that the ability to gain energy via engulfment of other unicells evolved early during evolution...thus from first principles, it is unlikely that there ever was an extended period (1\u20133 billion years) when there were no predators that lived by engulfing smaller cells\". This had implications when considering the most likely time that eukaryotes emerged, and challenged the view that these cells arose sometime between 9.85 ~ 2.75 billion years ago. From the starting point that phagocytotic predators were almost exclusively eukaryotic, the paper maintained that these existed earlier in evolution.[20]/nAfter working as a member of a team researching bird evolution in 2008, Penny co-authored the paper of the work which confirmed there were problems in this area for evolutionary biologists.  The writers said it was partly due to scientists being mislead by \"convergence of morphology...[and]...problems and phylogenies based on short DNA sequences\". The paper further attempted to resolve issues around \"the relationships between clades and the timing of the evolution of birds\", and based on the phylogenetic data, concluded that \"seven Metave species do not share a common evolutionary history within the Neoaves\".[21] Resolution of controversies around the understanding of the evolutionary relationship between modern birds due to this polytomy at the base of the Neonaves, is the focus of later research in which Penny participated. New developments suggested in this paper included reducing noise level and more accurate use of formulae to find predefined groupings in the optimal tree. Significantly, the research reported the existence of nine new mitochondrial genomes [which] \"support a major diversification of at least 12 neoavian lineages in the Late Cretaceous\".[22] Penny has also been involved in 2010 research that suggested some ratites nested and therefore had previously flown.[23]  One example, the extinct moa, closely related to the tinamou breed of birds from South America, according to Penny may have flown or \"was blown, to New Zealand via Antarctica before it froze over\".[24]/nA paper co-authored by Penny in 1995, noted that more genomic  data was needed to \"establish and clarify evolutionary relationships...to accurately estimate phylogenetic trees...[for]...the origin of land plants as a prerequisite for understanding  the  transition  from  the  aquatic  to  the  terrestrial habitat  of  plants\".[25]:\u200ap.137\u200a The paper challenged the view that variability between gene trees from different nuclear genes could lead to a conclusion of a 'supergene' tree, and suggested high levels of variability (hererogeniety) of gene trees needed to be incorporated in research into the origin of land plants. The conclusion was that research indicated the \"coalescent method across different subsets of data  consistently suggested  that  the  ancestors  of  Zygnematales  are  the  closest  relatives of  land  plants\".[25]:\u200ap.139\u200a Penny was part of a team, that in 2013 continued investigating the relationship between green algae and the evolution of land plants. A paper on the research, co-authored by Penny, concluded that after analysing a chloroplast genome data set, \"Zygnematales alone, or a clade consisting of Coleochaetales plus Zygnematales, [are] the closest living relatives of land plants\".[26]/nIn 1989 a team involving Penny used the science of evolutionary trees to analyse sequences from the H1 strand of human viruses and concluded their findings were \"in agreement with the biological (evolutionary) model\".[27] By 2006 researchers, including Penny, had described the molecular epidemiology of respiratory  syncytial virus (RSV), providing key information to aid RSV vaccine design and the development of novel treatment strategies.[28] The frequency of Hepatitis C virus in the Western Pacific islands was tested in 2013, and the paper, co-authored by Penny, put forward a hypothesis that \"genotypes 1 and/or 4 [were] circulating in South Pacific Island people and that these peoples [were] genetically predisposed to be more likely to spontaneous resolve HCV infection than to become chronic carriers\". However the researchers suggested that \"the prevalence and preponderance of HCV [made] it a global health problem and accurate epidemiological data must underpin any effort to prevent transmission and control the virus\".[29]/nPenny told Kim Hill on RNZ in 2008, any model that couldn't be tested was not of \"much use\",[30] and a paper he co-authored in 1982 considered claims by Karl Popper that \"Darwinism [was] not a testable scientific theory\". The study attempted to test the theory of evolution by comparing phylogentic trees, taking a scientific position presenting a programme that theoretically could refute evolutionary trees even existed. It concluded that because it was a \"falsifiable hypothesis\", it did not meet the criteria for scientific theories and could support the theory of evolution, while not considering the mechanics of evolution.[31] In 1986, Penny and Michael Hendy wrote a chapter in the book The Fascination of Statistics. They reconsidered the assertion by Karl Popper that the theory of evolution could not be tested as a  scientific theory because of the difficulties in making predictions about past events, and concluded that \"statistics can be used to make tests about unique events that occurred in the past\".[32] This debate was to be a continuing theme in Penny's work. He participated in research in 1991 that aimed to determine, without ambiguity, if evolutionary theory could meet Popper's criteria for the demarcation of science. The work found, by comparing trees from the same taxa but from \"different data sets\", what the writers concluded showed that the theory of a single sequence being sufficient to reconstruct a whole history of life, remained the \"Myth of a Universal Tree\".[33] In 2003, he co-authored a paper that acknowledged proving the theory of evolution posed difficulties, but noteed, \"the issues surrounding the testability of evolutionary theory are solvable by better science...[seldom with]...one definitive test...[more likely with]..specific tests to lead to testable predictions\".[34]/nPenny said that what has become known as the tree of life, is biblical in origin and not a phrase first used by Darwin, although he did describe it as a 'useful simile'. Penny contended that instead of using the tree of life concept, Darwin referred to his theory as 'descent with modification',  which may have included the idea of an evolutionary tree but was technically more about cycles resulting from \"hybridisation, endosymbiotic gene transfer, lateral gene transfer, recombination, lineage sorting, the complexities of genealogical relationships...[emphasising, for example]...the continuity between populations, subspecies, and sibling species\".[35]/nPenny was the president of the New Zealand Association of Scientists between 1989 and 1991.[36]/nHe was awarded the Marsden Medal in 2000 for outstanding service to science in New Zealand and internationally where he had extensive recognition and networks of collaborators, being acknowledged for \"Associate Fellowships at Merton College, Oxford, and Darwin College Cambridge and as Past President of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution\".[6]/nIn 2004 Penny received the Rutherford Medal for contributions to theoretical biology, molecular evolution and the analysis of DNA.[37]/nPenny was made a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2006 for services to science.[38] The Annual Report of the Institute of Molecular Biosciences (2007) noted that this award recognised \"those persons who in any field of endeavour, have rendered meritorious service to the Crown and nation or who have become distinguished by their eminence, talents, contributions or other merits\".[17]:\u200ap.6/nHe became the third New Zealander to be named a National Academy of Sciences foreign associate in 2018.[5]/nPenny's contributions to science have been widely acknowledged by academic contemporaries. Peter Lockhart from Massey University said that Penny had made a \"lifelong and lasting contribution to the study of molecular evolution...[and]...his work is characterised by great curiosity, intuition and a capacity to cross disciplines. In particular he has repeatedly demonstrated an uncanny ability to recognise innovative solutions to problems and to see proofs that mathematicians would eventually discover\".[5] Mike Steel, of the University of Canterbury, wrote in a tribute article in the New Zealand Science Review in 2009, that \"Penny's formula [remained] the most remarkable closed-form expression for any class of phylogenetic trees in evolutionary biology\".[5]", "67353728": "Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ballesta Germ\u00e1n (born 19 July 1958) is a Spanish medical professor and politician.

This work stood in sharp contrast to most researchers at the time, who believed that the differentiation of plant populations was due to phenotypic plasticity.

He has been in charge of the genetic diagnosis laboratory at the University Hospitals of Strasbourg since 1992, as well as a professor at the Coll\u00e8ge de France (Chair of Human Genetics) since 2003./nDoctor of Medicine (1971) and Doctor of Science (1974) from the University of Strasbourg (theses prepared under the supervision of Prof. Pierre Chambon), Jean-Louis Mandel was Associate Professor of Biochemistry at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Strasbourg from 1978 to 1984, then Professor of Medical Genetics at the same Faculty from 1984 to 2003 before being appointed to the Chair of Human Genetics at the Coll\u00e8ge de France. He leads a research team in human genetics at the LGME (Laboratoire de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique Mol\u00e9culaire des Eucaryotes, directed by Pierre Chambon) which became the Institute of Genetics and Molecular and Cellular Biology (IGBMC) in 1994. He started a molecular diagnosis of genetic diseases in 1985, which became the genetic diagnosis laboratory at the University Hospitals of Strasbourg in 1992, for which he has been responsible since then. Jean-Louis Mandel was appointed Director of the Institute of Genetics and Molecular and Cellular Biology (IGBMC) from 2002 to 2007, following its founder Pierre Chambon, then Deputy Director from 2007 to 2009. From 2008 to 2009, he was Director of the Mouse Clinic (ICS). He has also been a full member of the French Academy of sciences since 1999[1] and a corresponding member of the French Academy of Medicine./nSince 1982, Jean-Louis Mandel has been working on the identification of genes and mutations responsible for rare inherited monogenic diseases affecting the nervous system and/or muscles. He has also contributed to the development of diagnostic tests and the analysis of pathophysiological mechanisms for several of these diseases, using animal or cellular models in particular. His most important contribution concerns the identification and characterization of the mutation mechanism by unstable expansion of trinucleotide repetition. In 1991, his team showed that Fragile X mental retardation syndrome, the most common cause of hereditary intellectual disability, is due to the expansion of a CGG repetition associated with localized abnormal DNA methylation (Oberl\u00e9 et al. Sciences, 1991). From 1995 to 1997 his team (with notably Yvon Trottier), in collaboration with Alexis Brice's team (H\u00f4pital Piti\u00e9 Salp\u00e9tri\u00e8re) identified polyglutamine expansions as pathogenic epitopes in Huntington's disease and four other dominant ataxias, which led to the identification of genes involved in the spinocerebellar ataxias SCA2 and SCA7 (Trottier et al, Nature, 1995, Imbert et al. Nat Genet 1996, David et al. Nat Genet 1997). In 1996, with Michel Koenig and Massimo Pandolfo, he showed that Friedreich's Ataxia, a neurodegenerative disease, is caused by the expansion of a GAA repetition in the gene encoding a protein of unknown function, frataxin, and participates in clinical and genetic studies on this disease (D\u00fcrr et al, NEJM, 1996). Jean-Louis Mandel has also identified the genes responsible for adrenoleukodystrophy, with Patrick Aubourg (Mosser et al, Nature, 1993), ataxia with isolated vitamin E deficiency with Michel Koenig (Ouahchi et al, Nature Genetics, 1995), Coffin-Lowry syndrome (mental retardation linked to chromosome X) with Andr\u00e9 Hanauer (Trivier et al, Nature, 1996). His work with Jocelyn Laporte has led to the identification of the mutated MTM1 gene in X-linked myotubular myopathy (Laporte et al Nat Genet 1996) and more recently the mutated BIN1 gene in autosomal recessive centronuclear myopathy (Nicot et al, Nature Genet, 2007). For several years, Jean-Louis Mandel has concentrated a significant part of his activity on the development of effective strategies for the molecular diagnosis of monogenic intellectual deficiencies, which affect more than 1% of the population and are characterized by extreme genetic heterogeneity, and for a better clinical knowledge of these different genetic forms (projet GenIDA [2] [archive]) (Piton et al, AJHG, 2013, and Redin et al.

Born in East Prussia shortly before World War II began, she had dreams from an early age of becoming a veterinarian. When the war broke out, she became involved in the girls' wing of the Hitler Youth, but quit when her father no longer supported the Nazis. After a brief stint studying psychology in university, she worked in a factory and then at the Hagenbeck Zoo./nWhen her fiance moved to Johannesburg, Neumann followed him there and they married. Initially, Miljo worked in an office, but spent her weekends studying animals in the Kruger National Park. She bought a 50-acre parcel of land in Limpopo Province on the banks of the Olifants River in 1963. In 1980, she rescued an orphaned female baboon and became determined to establish a wildlife sanctuary for animals on her property. In 1989, she founded CARE, and developed a system to rehabilitate injured and orphaned animals so that they could be reintroduced to the wild. Because of her lack of training, her work initially was viewed by scientists with scepticism, but she came to be regarded as an expert in baboon care. Miljo died in a fire on the CARE property in 2012. Her life and work have been commemorated in several movies, television programmes, and a book./nRita Neumann was born on 18 February 1931 in Heilsberg, a small village in Eastern Prussia near K\u00f6nigsberg, Germany, which is now known as Kaliningrad and in Russia.[1][2] She grew up with a brother in a middle-class family and dreamed of becoming a veterinarian.[1][3] Her mother was strict and overprotective, limiting the activities in which Neumann was allowed to participate. At the age of eight, she joined the League of German Girls (the girls' wing of the Hitler Youth), relishing being able to compete in sports.[1][4]  Within a year, she became a leader in the Hitler Youth programme and was the province's youngest leader.[1] Her father was drafted into the army, but after the invasion of Poland did not support the Nazi regime and his daughter no longer participated in Hitler Youth.[5] Looking back on Nazism, Neumann later said that she was \"young and na\u00efve\" only later realizing \"the total madness we were subjected to\".[1]/nWhen the war ended in 1945, the family relocated to Bavaria in search of employment and schools for the children.[6] They eventually settled in Hamburg where her father found a civil service position and Neumann began attending the Kloster Schule, a nearby girls' high school.[7] Completing her studies in 1949, her plans to qualify as a veterinarian were thwarted by the post-war West German policy of favouring war veterans for admission to universities.[4][8] She enrolled in psychology courses, but she did not enjoy them and quit her studies when her mother was diagnosed with cancer. After her mother's death in 1951, Neumann took a factory job and brought her younger brother Peter to live with her.[9]/nWhen her father remarried, Peter returned to the family home and Neumann began working at the Hagenbeck Zoo, caring for primates.[9] At the age of nineteen, she met Lothar Simon, who was studying to become a mining engineer at the Technical University of Berlin.[4][10] When Simon graduated and secured a post in South Africa in 1953, Neumann decided to emigrate, hoping she could work with animals.[1][11] Simon had arranged for her to have a work permit and an office job, prior to her arrival.[12] The couple married in February 1954.[13] Simon worked in the gold fields and became very successful, allowing Neumann to be independent and adventurous.[1][14]/nOn weekends, Neumann would leave Johannesburg and travel to Kruger National Park. She met an ornithologist there, Dr. Kleynhans, who taught her South African history. The two travelled together into Zambia and Zimbabwe, where Kleynhans made recordings of birds. Neumann assisted him in his work by cataloguing his recordings.[15] She learned to fly and because male instructors would not teach her aerobatics, she bought a book and taught herself to do loops and spirals.[14] In 1963, she purchased a 50-acre parcel of land on the banks of the Olifants River in Limpopo Province.[4][16] She spent a lot of time away from home there. She first camped in a tent and later built a one-room hut on the property, to which she would bring her daughter Karin.[14] In 1972, both Simon and 17-year-old Karin were killed in a 1972 crash in a light aircraft, which he was piloting.[4][14]/nBy 1980, Neumann had remarried; her husband, Piet Miljo, was an Afrikaner. That year, while the couple were on an expedition into Angola, she discovered a baby female chacma baboon (papio ursinus), which had been abandoned.[1][3][14] At the time, under an ordinance known as the Vermin Law, passed by the Apartheid government, bush pigs, caracals, chacma baboons, jackals, and vervet monkeys were marked for extinction. This meant that they were considered pests, they could not be taken in, and hunters were encouraged to shoot them.[17] In defiance of the law, Miljo took the baboon, called Bobby, and clandestinely returned with it by way of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, crossing from Botswana's Gemsbok National Park into the adjoining Kalahari Gemsbok National Park in South Africa.[1] She and Piet divorced shortly after.[4]/nThough she had no formal scientific training in animal rescue, Miljo's humanitarian spirit motivated her to help animals. Her ideals followed those of Dian Fossey's with gorillas in Rwanda, Birut\u00e9 Galdikas's with orangutans in Indonesian Borneo, and Jane Goodall's with chimpanzees in Tanzania.[4][18] She began to rescue a variety of injured or orphaned small animals such as warthogs and porcupines, as well as assorted reptiles and birds.[4][19] By 1989, when the \"Centre for Animal Rehabilitation and Education\" (CARE) was officially founded, Miljo was focussing on baboon rescue, but continued to take in any animal which had been wounded or abandoned.[19][20] The refuge she established was thus populated with Cape bushbucks, crocodiles, monitor lizards, waterbucks, and water buffalo, as well as hippopotami and meerkats, all rescued by Miljo.[20][21]/nThe aim of CARE was to nurse orphaned and injured baboons back to health, while at the same time pioneering methods of reintroducing troops of convalesced baboons back into their natural habitat. Prior to Miljo establishing the sanctuary, no facilities existed in South Africa for rehabilitating these orphans.[4] When she spoke about baboons being social animals, scientists accused her of attributing human traits to them.[14] Many of the rescued animals which came under her care had been injured in hunting and road accidents or had lost their parents or troop because of fire or poaching, or because of conflict with farmers and suburbanites who had encroached upon their natural habitats.[19][21] The vermin laws at one time paid farmers per scalp, and allowed them to poison or shoot baboons. Farmers formed clubs to hunt them even on Miljo's reserve.[17][21] She was charged repeatedly with transporting and harbouring animals without proper permits and was legally required to reimburse members of hunting clubs for the bullets they had used to rid the reserve of vermin.[4][17]/nMiljo developed a protocol for hand-rearing orphaned baboons by first placing them with a human surrogate mother. Babies are bottle fed and constantly in contact with their surrogate, tied with a baby sling and accompanied twenty-four hours per day.[21][22] As the infant matures, baby baboons are gradually introduced to other infants and their surrogates, eventually being introduced to a troop after they are weaned at around six to twelve months old.[22] After about four years of familiarity with a troop and learning how to forage for food, the groups are assessed for reintroduction into the wild.[21][23] The first group of ten baboons released back into the wild in 1994, confounded many skeptical professional primatologists.[16] Reporter Julie Hyde Mew said that Miljo was \"the first person to hand-rear social wild animals and release them successfully back into the wild.\"[24] At the one-year anniversary of the first release, observers noted that seventy per cent of the hand-raised baboons had survived.[20]/nIn 1995, South Africa ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity, promoting hope that the Vermin Law would be overturned.[17] Although negotiations and open elections ended Apartheid rule in 1994, and many of the laws passed during that time were repealed, the Vermin Law remained valid in all but three Provinces of South Africa through 2007.[17][25][26] The second release was done in 1996, when eighteen baboons were reintroduced in the Mosdene Nature Preserve, which at the time was devoid of any baboon population.[20] Within ten years their population had soared to forty-five.[20][27] In 2000, Attie Gerber, a professor and co-creator of the television programme 50/50, first met Miljo in the Vredefort Dome.[28][29] Both Gerber and Mew repeatedly ran features on Miljo's work, using television and film to put pressure on government officials for their mistreatment of animals and to champion Miljo's work.[30]/nIn 2002, a troop of baboons were rescued from radiation testing being performed by the French military.[20] Nelson Mandela was present at their release back into the wild at the Vredefort Dome Conservation Area to show his support of her efforts to save baboons.[4][16][31] Miljo then released an additional troop of thirty-five baboons to the Vredefort Dome Conservation Area in the autumn of that year.[16][20] When she made the 2002 releases Gerber filmed both for the show.[28] Six of these baboons were killed, two animals being shot and one of the troops poisoned. The remaining members of both troops were captured and taken back to the centre until a safer release site could be found.[20] In 2006, Miljo released another twenty-five baboons into the Mosdene Nature Preserve.[27]/nBefore Miljo proved that troops could be formed by non-related baboons, scientists had assumed that troops were only formed through matriarchal lineages. In other words, it was thought that females and their offspring spent their lifetime in the same troop and dominant males came and went when hierarchies within the troop changed.[21] Soon large numbers of orphaned, injured and abused chacma baboons were being brought to the centre. Some of the rescued baboons had been held captive to procure faeces which were used in tribal medicines. Others had been the subjects of medical experiments.[4] Miljo's success brought with it sponsorships from the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) and other financial backing, which resulted in a steady stream of volunteer workers, journalists, scientists, and students, and the rehabilitation facility became known around the world.[32]/nIn all, more than a dozen troops, totalling some 250 baboons, were released in the last 20 years of Miljo's life.[4] To acquire permits to allow release, Miljo had to prove to authorities of the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism that a planned release was a conservation effort rather than humanitarian mission, that there would be no genetic contamination, and that there were adequate resources at the proposed release site to feed the animals. For aging baboons, deemed ineligible for release, Miljo provided a safe haven where they could be cared for and be fed.[31] In addition to her work with baboons, Miljo worked with IFAW to found a lion reserve in South Africa and established a successful breeding program for the Cercopithecus mitis labiatus, an endangered monkey species.[20] As she approached her eightieth birthday, Miljo began stepping away from managing CARE, but remained its most visible presence,[3] and was internationally considered to be an expert on baboons.[28][33]/nMiljo died on 27 July 2012, in Phalaborwa district, South Africa, in a fire which swept through her home and the centre. The blaze destroyed her apartment at the centre, the night nursery and the centre's clinic. The first baboon she ever saved, Bobby, also died in the blaze, with two other baboons.[4][34] By the time of her death, CARE had become the world's largest baboon sanctuary, housing around 600 animals.[34] Chacma baboons still enjoy almost no protection under South African law, as they are listed as declining but with a status of \"least concern\" in the CITES Appendix II.[35] In Limpopo Province, where the centre is located, it is now illegal to kill baboons, though in order to prosecute, a ballistics match must link a gun to the death.[36]/nMiljo served as a mentor and source of knowledge to others who had goals of establishing animal sanctuaries. Silke von Eynern, who established a vervet sanctuary, Bambelela Wildlife Care Centre, credited Miljo as her inspiration.[28] Chris Mercer and Beverley Pervan, who wrote Kalahari Dream in 2011 to tell of their efforts to establish the only animal rehabilitation centre in the Northern Cape, consulted her for advice on their own problems with officials and authorities.[4][28][37]/nIn 2004, Gerber published a book, Baboons: Tales, Traits and Troubles, as a tribute to Miljo's work.[16] That same year, she was featured in an Animal Planet documentary, Growing Up Baboon, which aired internationally and told the story of four of her baboons.[3][38] In 2014, a video, Lady Baboon, which chronicled Miljo's life, was produced by Adrian Cale.[39] In 2016, writer Michael Blumenthal, who had worked at CARE briefly in 2008, published \"Because They Needed Me\" from his notes made during his friendship with Miljo.[40][41]", "20790476": "GlaxoWellcome/nHarren Jhoti OBE FRS FMedSci FRSB FRSC (born 1962[1]) is an Indian-born British structural biologist whose main interest has been rational drug design and discovery.[3][4] He is president and chief executive officer (CEO) of biotechnology company Astex Pharmaceuticals (\"Astex\") which is located in Cambridge, United Kingdom./nJhoti co-founded Astex with Tom Blundell and Chris Abell in 1999.[4][5] He pioneered the development of fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD),[3][6][7] an approach now widely used in industry and academia, which identifies small molecules with potential therapeutic potential as part of the drug discovery process.

In it he advocated for the establishment of botanical gardens dedicated to the study of plant physiology, a vision that he later played a significant role in realizing./nHe returned to Breslau in 1848 and, after a delay due to his Jewish heritage, was appointed as a privat-docent in 1850.[1] He remained at that university for the rest of his career, obtaining the titled of professor in 1857 and, following the death of his mentor G\u00f6ppert, was promoted to a full professorship in 1872./nCohn was a prolific writer, leaving behind over 150 papers, essays, and books.[1]/nIn the 1850s he studied the growth and division of plant cells. In 1855 he produced papers on the sexuality of Sphaeroplea annulina and later Volvox globator. In the 1860s he studied plant physiology in several different aspects. From 1870 onward he mostly studied bacteria. He established the use of sterile culture mediums and rediscovered the botanical garden of Lorenz Scholz von Rosenau in Breslau./nCohn was the first to classify algae as plants, and to define what distinguishes them from green plants. His classification of bacteria into four groups based on shape (sphericals, short rods, threads, and spirals) is still in use today.

Jaffe (born January 9, 1952) is an American biologist who is a Professor and chair at the University of Connecticut. Her research considers the physiological mechanisms that regulate oocyte cell and fertilisation. She was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2021./nJaffe was born in Pasadena, California.[1] Her father, Lionel F. Jaffe, was a senior scientist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Her mother, Miriam (Walther) Jaffe, was a professor of astronomy at Purdue University.[2] Jaffe was an undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. After two years, she moved to Purdue University, where she majored in biology. She was a graduate researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, where she worked under the supervision of Susumu Hagiwara. Her doctoral research considered polyspermy in sea urchin eggs.[3] After graduating, Jaffe worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution with Lewis Tilney and at the University of California, San Diego with Meredith Gould.[1]/nJaffe studies the physiological mechanisms that regulate oocyte cell and fertilisation.[4] In particular, she is interested in the meiosis process that takes place in mammalian ovarian follicles. Meiosis is a type of cell division that prepares the oocyte for fertilisation. The process begins during embryonic development, and then arrests for a prolonged period of time in a prophase. The follicle (including the oocyte and granulosa cells) regulates meiotic progression in the oocyte. She identified the proteins (Gs protein) and receptors (GPR3) that are responsible for meiotic prophase arrests. The activity of these proteins result in the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which keeps the cell cycles arrested.[4] Meanwhile, the granulosa cells within the follicle regulate the hydrolysis of cAMP, a process which involves cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that maintains high cAMP and meiotic arrest. The signalling system within the granulosa cell switches in response to the luteinizing hormone, which Jaffe has shown lowers the cGMP. This decrease in cGMP can be monitored using confocal microscopy of mice follicles that express the Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) sensor cGi500.[4]/nJaffe has studied the processes that give rise to the fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-induced inhibition of bone growth. Hormonal signalling decreases the amount of cGMP by inactivating NPR2. In the ovaries, this causes the cGMP to resume meiotic function, whilst it diminishes growth within bones.[4]", "46349526": "Amita Sehgal is a molecular biologist and chronobiologist in the Department of Neuroscience at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.[1] Sehgal was involved in the discovery of Drosophila TIM and many other important components of the Drosophila clock mechanism.[2] Sehgal also played a pivotal role in the development of Drosophila as a model for the study of sleep.[3][4] Her research continues to be focused on understanding the genetic basis of sleep  and also how circadian systems relate to other aspects of physiology.[5]/nSehgal grew up in India, and earned her BSc as an undergraduate at Delhi University and her MSc at Jawaharlal Nehru University, both in New Delhi, India.[6] She began pursuing her PhD in cell biology and genetics at Cornell University in 1983.[6] It was here, while studying a human neuronal growth factor, that her interest in science truly developed.[6] In 1988, she began her Postdoctoral Fellowship at Rockefeller University in the lab of Michael Young, where she had her first exposure to the study of circadian rhythms, a field in which she has since remained.[6]/nAmita Sehgal has contributed tremendously towards the understanding of the biological clock of Drosophila melanogaster. In 1994, Sehgal, Price, Man, and Young,  through forward genetics, discovered a mutant of the gene timeless (TIM) in Drosophila melanogaster.[2][7] In the following year, Sehgal and colleagues cloned TIM  through positional cloning and were able to show that TIM and  PER had similar cycling levels of their mRNA.[2][8][9] The model they proposed, which was confirmed over time, was that PER and TIM interact and accumulate during the day. In the evening, they enter the nucleus to inhibit the transcription of their mRNA. In 1996, Sehgal's laboratory showed that degradation in TIM levels caused by a pulse of light  resets the circadian clock.[10] Later, they showed that specific phosphatases control stability of PER and TIM in daily cycles.[11]/nNeurofibromin 1 (NF1) is a tumor suppressor gene known to be dis-regulated in Neurofibromatosis type 1, a disorder which causes tumors along the spine. In 2001, Sehgal and her colleagues learned that some patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 also experience irregularities in their sleep, and so decided to investigate the circadian rhythms of flies with a nonfunctional NF1 gene.[12] They found that these flies also have disrupted circadian rhythms, and these rhythms could be restored by inserting NF1 transgenes, thus proving that NF1 is involved in the circadian pathway. They showed that in flies, NF1 functions through the MAP kinase pathway, which is the same pathway implicated in Neurofibromatosis type 1 in humans.[12]/nIn 2006, Sehgal and her colleagues discovered a mutant fly which takes an abnormally long time to adjust to new light-dark cycles.[13] They named the underlying mutated gene jetlag (jet). This gene codes for an F-box protein called JET, a ubiquitin ligase that facilitates resetting the drosophila clock. Sequencing of the gene revealed two alleles of jetlag: the \"c\" allele (common) and the \"r\" allele (rare). In the presence of CRYPTOCHROME (CRY), JET plays a major role in the degradation of TIMELESS (TIM) protein in response to light, which is necessary for the clock to entrain to external light cues./nMushroom bodies are located in the brains of Drosophila and are known to play a role in learning, memory, olfaction, and locomotion.[14] In 2006, Sehgal and her colleagues discovered that mushroom bodies also play a major role in regulating sleep in flies. By using a steroid called RU-486 (Mifepristone) to regulate protein kinase A (PKA), they were able to upregulate and downregulate the expression of genes in specific areas like the mushroom bodies, and found that this structure is critical for fly sleep.[15] While the specific pathway through which these mushroom bodies regulate sleep is currently unknown, it may be that they are involved in inhibiting processing of sensory information, allowing flies to fall asleep./nIn 2008, Sehgal et al. discovered the sleepless gene in fruit flies through insertional mutagenesis.[16]  Mutations in the sleepless gene caused the flies to sleep 80% less than normal flies, and live half as long as normal flies. Sehgal et al. discovered that the SLEEPLESS protein regulates the voltage-gated potassium channel, Shaker, and also nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, specifically one called redeye that they discovered through another genetic screen.[17] Sehgal et al. also found increased stem cell activity within the testes of male flies with mutations in sleepless./nAll species, including humans, sleep a lot in early life.  Sehgal et al discovered what keeps sleep at high levels in young fruit flies.  They also found that when sleep is disrupted in early life, mating behavior is perturbed in adults.[18]  Thus, sleep may be required to allow brain development for behaviors that promote survival and species propagation.  In adult animals, a possible function of sleep is to promote clearance of waste.[19]  Sehgal et al found that sleep promotes endocytosis through the blood brain barrier in flies.[20]/nThe blood brain barrier (BBB) protects the brain from potentially harmful molecules in the periphery, but it can also impede the delivery of drugs to the central nervous system.  Sehgal et al found that  permeability of the fly BBB changes over the course of the day: night cycle, so an anti-epileptic works better at a specific time of day.[21] They have also mapped circuits that link the clock to behavioral activity.[22]/nSeeking to identify molecules that induce sleep, Toda et al conducted a genetic screen of >10,000 of fruit fly strains, and found one that drives sleep.  This molecule, which they named nemuri, is an anti-microbial peptide.  Its expression is switched on by infection or sleep deprivation, and it promotes survival by killing bacteria and increasing sleep.[23][24]/n[25]", "59096281": "Daniel E.

He died on December 3, 2004, at Garrett County Memorial Hospital in Oakland.[1][4]/nDespite being a theologically conservative Baptist, Wonderly accepted the scientific evidence that the Earth was much older than young-earth creationists believe it to be.[5] In explaining his views on evolution and the age of the Earth, he wrote, \"Christians need to reject evolutionism, but when they reject true scientific discoveries they bring disgrace upon the Bible and Christianity.\"[2] He supported reconciling the old age of the Earth with the teachings of the Bible by means of day-age creationism. When administrators at Grace College learned about Wonderly's unfavorable views of young-earth creationism and flood geology, they agreed to hire him only on the condition that he not interfere with the College's commitment to advancing young-earth creationism. Wonderly agreed, but after some of his students found out about his views, the College's president banned Wonderly from further discussing his views at all, prompting Wonderly to resign. Prominent young-earth creationist Henry Morris defended Grace's handling of Wonderly's anti-creationist views, arguing that these views were already receiving a fair hearing throughout society.[5]", "48348391": "Irene Bernasconi (29 September 1896 \u2013 7 July 1989) was an Argentine marine biologist specializing in echinoderm research and best known for her work in the Antarctic.[2] She was the first echinoderm specialist in Argentina and spent 55 years conducting research into echinoderms found in the Argentine Sea.

She graduated from high school in 1938 and attended Talladega College, a historically black college in Talladega, Alabama.[3]/nNeither of her parents had higher than an eighth grade education,[4] and Woods's father died when she was a teenager,[3] but her mother was very adamant about Woods doing well in school.

Since she was always aware that she never had the opportunity to get an education, she wanted me, her only child, to have all the education I desired.\"[2]/nIn 1940, Woods's mother fell ill and was admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. In order to be closer to her, Woods transferred to Howard University in Washington, D.C.[4] At Howard University, Woods excelled in biology and other science classes.[4] Dr. Louis Hansborough, a professor at Howard, encouraged her to continue studying embryology after graduation in 1942.

Her widely praised 1951 bestseller The Sea Around Us won her a U.S. National Book Award,[2] recognition as a gifted writer and financial security. Her next book, The Edge of the Sea, and the reissued version of her first book, Under the Sea Wind, were also bestsellers. This sea trilogy explores the whole of ocean life from the shores to the depths./nLate in the 1950s, Carson turned her attention to conservation, especially some problems she believed were caused by synthetic pesticides. The result was the book Silent Spring (1962), which brought environmental concerns to an unprecedented share of the American people. Although Silent Spring was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, it spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy, which led to a nationwide ban on DDT and other pesticides. It also inspired a grassroots environmental movement that led to the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.[3] Carson was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Jimmy Carter./nRachel Carson was born on May 27, 1907, on a family farm near Springdale, Pennsylvania, located by the Allegheny River near Pittsburgh. She was the daughter of Maria Frazier (McLean) and Robert Warden Carson, an insurance salesman.[4] She spent a lot of time exploring around her family's 65-acre (26\u00a0ha) farm. An avid reader, she began writing stories (often involving animals) at age eight. She had her first story published at age ten. She especially enjoyed the St. Nicholas Magazine (which carried her first published stories), the works of Beatrix Potter, and the novels of Gene Stratton-Porter, and in her teen years, Herman Melville, Joseph Conrad and Robert Louis Stevenson. The natural world, particularly the ocean, was the common thread of her favorite literature. Carson attended Springdale's small school through tenth grade, then completed high school in nearby Parnassus, Pennsylvania, graduating in 1925 at the top of her class of forty-four students.[5]/nIn high school, Carson was somewhat of a loner. At the Pennsylvania College for Women (now Chatham University), she originally studied English but switched her major to biology in January 1928. However, she continued contributing to the school's student newspaper and literary supplement.[6] Though admitted to graduate standing at Johns Hopkins University in 1928, she was forced to remain at the Pennsylvania College for Women for her senior year due to financial difficulties; she graduated magna cum laude in 1929. After a summer course at the Marine Biological Laboratory, she continued her studies in zoology and genetics at Johns Hopkins in the fall of 1929.[7]/nAfter her first year of graduate school, Carson became a part-time student, taking an assistantship in Raymond Pearl's laboratory, where she worked with rats and Drosophila, to earn money for tuition. After false starts with pit vipers and squirrels, she completed a dissertation on the embryonic development of the pronephros in fish. She earned a master's degree in zoology in June 1932. She had intended to continue for a doctorate, however in 1934 Carson was forced to leave Johns Hopkins to search for a full-time teaching position to help support her family during the Great Depression.[8] In 1935, her father died suddenly, worsening their already critical financial situation and leaving Carson to care for her aging mother. At the urging of her undergraduate biology mentor Mary Scott Skinker, she settled for a temporary position with the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, writing radio copy for a series of weekly educational broadcasts entitled Romance Under the Waters. The series of 52 seven-minute programs focused on aquatic life and was intended to generate public interest in fish biology and the bureau's work, a task the several writers before Carson had not managed. Carson also began submitting articles on marine life in the Chesapeake Bay, based on her research for the series, to local newspapers and magazines.[9]/nCarson's supervisor, pleased with the success of the radio series, asked her to write the introduction to a public brochure about the fisheries bureau; he also worked to secure her the first full-time position that became available. Sitting for the civil service exam, she outscored all other applicants and, in 1936, became the second woman hired by the Bureau of Fisheries for a full-time professional position, as a junior aquatic biologist.[10]/nAt the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Carson's primary responsibilities were to analyze and report field data on fish populations and write brochures and other literature for the public. Using her research and consultations with marine biologists as starting points, she also wrote a steady stream of articles for The Baltimore Sun and other newspapers. However, her family responsibilities further increased in January 1937 when her older sister died, leaving Carson as the sole breadwinner for her mother and two nieces.[11]/nIn July 1937, the Atlantic Monthly accepted a revised version of an essay, The World of Waters, that she originally wrote for her first fisheries bureau brochure. Her supervisor had deemed it too good for that purpose. The essay, published as Undersea, was a vivid narrative of a journey along the ocean floor. It marked a major turning point in Carson's writing career. Publishing house Simon & Schuster, impressed by Undersea, contacted Carson and suggested that she expand it into a book. Several years of writing resulted in Under the Sea Wind (1941), which received excellent reviews but sold poorly. In the meantime, Carson's article-writing success continued\u2014her features appeared in Sun Magazine, Nature, and Collier's.[12] Carson attempted to leave the Bureau (by then transformed into the United States Fish and Wildlife Service) in 1945. However, few jobs for naturalists were available, as most money for science was focused on technical fields in the wake of the Manhattan Project. In mid-1945, Carson first encountered the subject of DDT, a revolutionary new pesticide\u2014lauded as the \"insect bomb\" after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki\u2014that was only beginning to undergo tests for safety and ecological effects. DDT was but one of Carson's many writing interests at the time, and editors found the subject unappealing; she published nothing on DDT until 1962.[13]/nCarson rose within the Fish and Wildlife Service, by 1945 supervising a small writing staff and in 1949 becoming chief editor of publications. Her position provided increasing opportunities for fieldwork and freedom in choosing her writing projects; however, it also entailed increasingly tedious administrative responsibilities. By 1948, Carson was working on material for a second book and had made the conscious decision to begin a transition to writing full-time. That year, she took on a literary agent, Marie Rodell; they formed a close professional relationship that would last the rest of Carson's career.[14]/nOxford University Press expressed interest in Carson's book proposal for a life history of the ocean, spurring her to complete by early 1950 the manuscript of what would become The Sea Around Us.[15] Chapters appeared in Science Digest and The Yale Review\u2014the latter chapter, \"The Birth of an Island,\" winning the American Association for the Advancement of Science's George Westinghouse Science Writing Prize. Nine chapters were serialized in The New Yorker beginning June 1951. The book was published July 2, 1951, by Oxford University Press. The Sea Around Us remained on The New York Times Best Seller list for 86 weeks, was abridged by Reader's Digest, won the 1952 National Book Award for Nonfiction[2] and the John Burroughs Medal, and resulted in Carson's being awarded two honorary doctorates. She also licensed a documentary film based on it. The Sea's success led to the republication of Under the Sea Wind, which became a bestseller itself. With success came financial security, and in 1952 Carson was able to give up her job in order to concentrate on writing full-time.[16]/nCarson was inundated with requests for speaking engagements, fan mail and other correspondence regarding The Sea Around Us, along with work on the script that she had secured the right to review.[17] She was very unhappy with the final version of the script by writer, director, and producer Irwin Allen; she found it untrue to the atmosphere of the book and scientifically embarrassing, describing it as \"a cross between a believe-it-or-not and a breezy travelogue.\"[18] However, she discovered that her right to review the script did not extend to any control over its content. This led to many scientific inconsistencies inside the film. Despite Carson's requests to resolve these problems, Allen went forward with the script. He succeeded in producing a very successful documentary. It went on to win the 1953 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. However, Carson was so embittered by the experience that she never again sold film rights to her work.[19]/nCarson met Dorothy M. Freeman in the summer of 1953 on Southport Island, Maine. Freeman had written to Carson welcoming her to the area when she had heard that the famous author was to become her neighbor. It was the beginning of a devoted friendship that would last the rest of Carson's life. Their relationship was conducted mainly through letters and during summers spent together in Maine. Over 12 years, they exchanged around 900 letters. Many of these were published in the book Always, Rachel, published in 1995 by Beacon Press./nCarson's biographer, Linda J. Lear, writes that \"Carson sorely needed a devoted friend and kindred spirit who would listen to her without advising and accept her wholly, the writer as well as the woman.\"[20] She found this in Freeman. The two women had common interests, nature chief among them, and began exchanging letters regularly while apart. They shared summers for the remainder of Carson's life and met whenever else their schedules permitted.[21]/nConcerning the depth of their relationship, commentators have said: \"the expression of their love was limited almost wholly to letters and very occasional farewell kisses or holding of hands\".[22] Freeman shared parts of Carson's letters with her husband to help him understand the relationship, but much of their correspondence was carefully guarded.[23] Some believe Freeman and Carson's relationship was romantic in nature.[24][25] One of the letters from Carson to Freeman reads: \"But, oh darling, I want to be with you so terribly that it hurts!\", while in another, Freeman writes: \"I love you beyond expression... My love is boundless as the Sea.\"[26] Carson's last letter to Freeman before her death ends with: \"Never forget, dear one, how deeply I have loved you all these years.\"[27]/nShortly before Carson's death, she and Freeman destroyed hundreds of letters. The surviving correspondence was published in 1995 as Always, Rachel: The Letters of Rachel Carson and Dorothy Freeman, 1952\u20131964: An Intimate Portrait of a Remarkable Friendship, edited by Martha Freeman, Dorothy's granddaughter, who wrote at publication: \"A few comments in early letters indicate that Rachel and Dorothy were initially cautious about the romantic tone and terminology of their correspondence. I believe this caution prompted their destruction of some letters within the first two years of their friendship...\"[28] According to one reviewer, the pair \"fit Carolyn Heilbrun's characterization of a strong female friendship, where what matters is 'not whether friends are homosexual or heterosexual, lovers or not, but whether they share the wonderful energy of work in the public sphere.'\"[29]/nAccording to her biographer, Linda Lear, there was a disagreement about the final arrangements for Rachel. Her brother, Robert Carson, insisted that her cremated remains be buried beside their mother in Maryland. This was against her wishes to be buried in Maine. In the end, a compromise was reached. Carson's wishes were carried out by an organizing committee, including her agent (Marie Rodell), her editor (Paul Brooks), and Dorothy Freeman. In the spring of 1964, Dorothy received half of Rachel's ashes in the mail sent to her by Robert Carson. In the summer of that year, Dorothy carried out Rachel's final wishes, scattering her ashes along the rocky shores of Sheepscot Bay in Maine.[30]/nEarly in 1953, Carson began library and field research on the ecology and organisms of the Atlantic shore.[31] In 1955, she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy, The Edge of the Sea, which focuses on life in coastal ecosystems, particularly along the Eastern Seaboard. It appeared in The New Yorker in two condensed installments shortly before its October 26 book release by Houghton Mifflin (again a new publisher). By this time, Carson's reputation for clear and poetical prose was well established; The Edge of the Sea received highly favorable reviews, if not quite as enthusiastic as for The Sea Around Us.[32]/nThrough 1955 and 1956, Carson worked on several projects\u2014including the script for an Omnibus episode, \"Something About the Sky\"\u2014and wrote articles for popular magazines. Her plan for the next book was to address evolution. However, the publication of Julian Huxley's Evolution in Action\u2014and her own difficulty in finding a clear and compelling approach to the topic\u2014led her to abandon the project. Instead, her interests were turning to conservation. She considered an environment-themed book project tentatively titled Remembrance of the Earth and became involved with The Nature Conservancy and other conservation groups. She also made plans to buy and preserve from development an area in Maine she and Freeman called the \"Lost Woods.\"[33]/nIn early 1957, a family tragedy struck for the third time when one of her nieces she had cared for since the 1940s died at the age of 31, leaving her 5-year-old son, Roger Christie, an orphan. Carson took on the responsibility for Roger when she adopted him, along with caring for her aging mother. Carson moved to Silver Spring, Maryland to care for Roger and spent much of 1957 putting together a new living situation and studying specific environmental threats./nBy late 1957, Carson was closely following federal proposals for widespread pesticide spraying; the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) planned to eradicate fire ants. Other spraying programs involving chlorinated hydrocarbons and organophosphates were on the rise.[34] For the rest of her life, Carson's main professional focus would be the dangers of pesticide overuse./nSilent Spring, Carson's most influential book, was published by Houghton Mifflin on September 27, 1962.[35] The book described the harmful effects of pesticides on the environment, and is widely credited with helping launch the environmental movement.[36] Carson was not the first or the only person to raise concern about DDT,[37] but her combination of \"scientific knowledge and poetic writing\" reached a broad audience and helped to focus opposition to DDT use.[38] In 1994, an edition of Silent Spring was published with an introduction written by Vice President Al Gore.[39][40] In 2012 Silent Spring was designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society for its role in the development of the modern environmental movement.[41]/nStarting in the mid-1940s, Carson had become concerned about the use of synthetic pesticides, many of which had been developed through the military funding of science since World War II. However, the United States federal government's 1957 gypsy moth (now called spongy moth) eradication program prompted Carson to devote her research and her next book to pesticides and environmental poisons. The gypsy moth program involved aerial spraying of DDT and other pesticides (mixed with fuel oil), including the spraying of private land. Landowners on Long Island filed a lawsuit to have the spraying stopped, and many in affected regions followed the case closely.[3] Though the suit was lost, the Supreme Court granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future; this laid the basis for later successful environmental actions.[3][42][43]/nThe Audubon Naturalist Society also actively opposed such spraying programs and recruited Carson to help make public the government's exact spraying practices and the related research.[44] Carson began the four-year project of what would become Silent Spring by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to DDT. She also attempted to enlist others to join the cause, such as essayist E. B. White and several journalists and scientists. By 1958, Carson had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with Newsweek science journalist Edwin Diamond. However, when The New Yorker commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing more than simply the introduction and conclusion as planned; soon, it was a solo project. (Diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of Silent Spring).[45]/nAs her research progressed, Carson found a sizable community of scientists who were documenting the physiological and environmental effects of pesticides.[3] She also took advantage of her connections with many government scientists, who supplied her with confidential information. From reading the scientific literature and interviewing scientists, Carson found two scientific camps when it came to pesticides: those who dismissed the possible danger of pesticide spraying barring conclusive proof, and those who were open to the possibility of harm and willing to consider alternative methods such as biological pest control.[46]/nShe also found significant support and extensive evidence from a group of biodynamic agriculture organic market gardeners, their adviser, Dr. Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, other contacts, and their suite of legal actions (1957-1960) against the U.S. Government. According to recent research by Paull (2013), this may have been the primary and (for strategic reasons) uncredited source for Carson's book. Marjorie Spock and Mary T. Richards of Long Island, New York, contested the aerial spraying of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). They compiled their evidence and shared it with Carson, who used it, their extensive contacts, and the trial transcripts as a primary input for Silent Spring. Carson wrote of the content as \"a gold mine of information\" and says, \"I feel guilty about the mass of your material I have here\"[47] and makes multiple references to Pfeiffer and his correspondence.[48][49]/nBy 1959, the USDA's Agricultural Research Service responded to the criticism by Carson and others with a public service film, Fire Ant on Trial; Carson characterized it as \"flagrant propaganda\" that ignored the dangers that spraying pesticides (especially dieldrin and heptachlor) posed to humans and wildlife. That spring, Carson wrote a letter, published in The Washington Post, that attributed the recent decline in bird populations\u2014in her words, the \"silencing of birds\"\u2014to pesticide overuse.[50] That was also the year of the \"Great Cranberry Scandal\": the 1957, 1958, and 1959 crops of U.S. cranberries were found to contain high levels of the herbicide aminotriazole (which caused cancer in laboratory rats), and the sale of all cranberry products was halted. Carson attended the subsequent FDA hearings on revising pesticide regulations; she came away discouraged by the aggressive tactics of the chemical industry representatives, which included expert testimony that was firmly contradicted by the bulk of the scientific literature she had been studying. She also wondered about the possible \"financial inducements behind certain pesticide programs.\"[51]/nResearch at the Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health brought Carson into contact with medical researchers investigating the gamut of cancer-causing chemicals. Of particular significance was the work of National Cancer Institute researcher and environmental cancer section founding director Wilhelm Hueper, who classified many pesticides as carcinogens. Carson and her research assistant Jeanne Davis, with the help of NIH librarian Dorothy Algire, found evidence to support the pesticide-cancer connection; to Carson, the evidence for the toxicity of a wide array of synthetic pesticides was clear-cut, though such conclusions were very controversial beyond the small community of scientists studying pesticide carcinogenesis.[52]/nBy 1960, Carson had more than enough research material, and the writing was progressing rapidly. In addition to the thorough literature search, she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the human sickness and ecological damage that resulted. However, in January, a duodenal ulcer followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks, greatly delaying the completion of Silent Spring. As she was nearing full recovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book), she discovered cysts in her left breast, one of which necessitated a mastectomy. Though her doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December, Carson discovered that the tumor was malignant and the cancer had metastasized.[53] Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of The Sea Around Us and by a collaborative photo essay with Erich Hartmann.[54] Most of the research and writing was done by the fall of 1960, except for the discussion of recent research on biological pest controls and investigations of a handful of new pesticides. However, further health troubles slowed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962.[55] While writing the book, Carson chose to hide her illness so that the pesticide companies could not use it against her (she worried that if the companies knew, they would use it as ammunition to make her book look untrustworthy and biased).[56]/nFinding a title for the book proved difficult; \"Silent Spring\" was initially suggested as a title for the chapter on birds. By August 1961, Carson finally agreed to the suggestion of her literary agent Marie Rodell: Silent Spring would be a metaphorical title for the entire book, suggesting a bleak future for the whole natural world, rather than a single chapter title about the literal absence of birdsong.[57] With Carson's approval, editor Paul Brooks at Houghton Mifflin arranged for illustrations by Louis and Lois Darling, who also designed the cover. The final writing was the first chapter, A Fable for Tomorrow, which Carson intended as a gentle introduction to what might otherwise be a forbiddingly serious topic. By mid-1962, Brooks and Carson had essentially finished the editing and were laying the groundwork for promoting the book by sending the manuscript out to select individuals for final suggestions.[58]/nNiographer Mark Hamilton Lytle writes that Carson \"quite self-consciously decided to write a book calling into question the paradigm of scientific progress that defined post-war American culture.\" The overriding theme of Silent Spring is the powerful\u2014and often adverse\u2014effect humans have on the natural world.[59]/nCarson's main argument is that pesticides have detrimental effects on the environment; they are more properly termed biocides, she argues, because their effects are rarely limited to the target pests. DDT is a prime example, but other synthetic pesticides come under scrutiny, many of which are subject to bioaccumulation. Carson also accuses the chemical industry of intentionally spreading disinformation and public officials of accepting industry claims uncritically. Most of the book is devoted to pesticides' effects on natural ecosystems. However, four chapters also detail cases of human pesticide poisoning, cancer, and other illnesses attributed to pesticides.[60] Regarding DDT and cancer, the subject of so much subsequent debate, Carson only briefly mentions the topic:/nIn laboratory tests on animal subjects, DDT has produced suspicious liver tumors. Scientists of the Food and Drug Administration who reported the discovery of these tumors were uncertain how to classify them but felt there was some \"justification for considering them low grade hepatic cell carcinomas.\" Dr. Hueper [author of Occupational Tumors and Allied Diseases] now gives DDT the definite rating of a \"chemical carcinogen.\"[61]/nCarson predicted increased consequences in the future, especially as targeted pests develop pesticide resistance. At the same time, weakened ecosystems fall prey to unanticipated invasive species. The book closes with a call for a biotic approach to pest control as an alternative to chemical pesticides.[62]/nRegarding DDT, Carson never called for an outright ban. Part of the argument she made in Silent Spring was that even if DDT and other insecticides had no environmental side effects, their indiscriminate overuse was counter-productive because it would create insect resistance, making them useless in eliminating the target insect populations:/nNo responsible person contends that insect-borne disease should be ignored. The question that has now urgently presented itself is whether it is either wise or responsible to attack the problem by methods that are rapidly making it worse. The world has heard much of the triumphant war against disease by controlling insect vectors of infection. However, it has heard little of the other side of the story\u2014the defeats, the short-lived triumphs that now strongly support the alarming view that the insect enemy has been made actually stronger by our efforts. Even worse, we may have destroyed our very means of fighting.[63]/nCarson further noted that \"Malaria programmes are threatened by resistance among mosquitoes\"[64] and emphasized the advice given by the director of Holland's Plant Protection Service: \"Practical advice should be 'Spray as little as you possibly can' rather than 'Spray to the limit of your capacity' ... Pressure on the pest population should always be as slight as possible.\"[65]/nCarson and the others involved with the publication of Silent Spring expected fierce criticism. They were particularly concerned about the possibility of being sued for libel. Carson was also undergoing radiation therapy to combat her spreading cancer and expected to have little energy to devote to defending her work and responding to critics. In preparation for the anticipated attacks, Carson and her agent attempted to amass as many prominent supporters as possible before the book's release.[66]/nMost of the book's scientific chapters were reviewed by scientists with relevant expertise, among whom Carson found strong support. Carson attended the White House Conference on Conservation in May 1962; Houghton Mifflin distributed proof copies of Silent Spring to many of the delegates and promoted the upcoming New Yorker serialization. Among many others, Carson also sent a proof copy to Supreme Court Associate Justice William O. Douglas, a longtime environmental advocate who had argued against the court's rejection of the Long Island pesticide spraying case (and who had provided Carson with some of the material included in her chapter on herbicides).[67]/nThough Silent Spring had generated a relatively high level of interest based on pre-publication promotion, this became much more intense with the serialization in The New Yorker, which began on June 16, 1962, issue. This brought the book to the attention of the chemical industry and its lobbyists and a wide swath of the American populace. Around that time, Carson also learned that Silent Spring had been selected as the Book of the Month for October; as she put it, this would \"carry it to farms and hamlets all over that country that don't know what a bookstore looks like\u2014much less The New Yorker.\"[68] Other publicity included a positive editorial in The New York Times and excerpts of the serialized version in Audubon magazine, with another round of publicity in July and August as chemical companies responded. The story of the birth defect-causing drug thalidomide broke just before the book's publication as well, inviting comparisons between Carson and Frances Oldham Kelsey, the Food and Drug Administration reviewer who had blocked the drug's sale in the United States.[69]/nIn the weeks leading up to the September 27, 1962, publication, there was strong opposition to Silent Spring from the chemical industry. DuPont (a main manufacturer of DDT and 2,4-D) and Velsicol Chemical Corporation (exclusive manufacturer of chlordane and heptachlor) were among the first to respond. DuPont compiled an extensive report on the book's press coverage and estimated impact on public opinion. Velsicol threatened legal action against Houghton Mifflin and The New Yorker and Audubon unless the planned Silent Spring features were canceled. Chemical industry representatives and lobbyists also lodged a range of non-specific complaints, some anonymously. Chemical companies and associated organizations produced a number of their own brochures and articles promoting and defending pesticide use. However, Carson's and the publishers' lawyers were confident in the vetting process Silent Spring had undergone. The magazine and book publications proceeded as planned, as did the large Book-of-the-Month printing (which included a pamphlet endorsing the book by William O. Douglas).[70]/nAmerican Cyanamid biochemist Robert White-Stevens and former Cyanamid chemist Thomas Jukes were among the most aggressive critics, especially of Carson's analysis of DDT.[71] According to White-Stevens, \"If man were to follow the teachings of Miss Carson, we would return to the Dark Ages, and the insects and diseases and vermin would once again inherit the earth.\"[72] Others went further, attacking Carson's scientific credentials (because her training was in marine biology rather than biochemistry) and her character. White-Stevens labeled her \"...a fanatic defender of the cult of the balance of nature,\"[73] while former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson, in a letter to former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, reportedly concluded that because she was unmarried despite being physically attractive, she was \"probably a Communist.\"[74]/nMany critics repeatedly asserted that she was calling for the elimination of all pesticides. However, Carson had made it clear she was not advocating the banning or complete withdrawal of helpful pesticides but was instead encouraging responsible and carefully managed use with an awareness of the chemicals' impact on the entire ecosystem.[75] In fact, she concludes her section on DDT in Silent Spring not by urging a total ban but with advice for spraying as little as possible to limit the development of resistance.[65]/nThe academic community, including prominent defenders such as H. J. Muller, Loren Eiseley, Clarence Cottam, and Frank Egler, by and large, backed the book's scientific claims; public opinion soon turned Carson's way as well. The chemical industry campaign backfired, as the controversy greatly increased public awareness of potential pesticide dangers, as well as Silent Spring book sales. Pesticide use became a major public issue, especially after the CBS Reports TV special The Silent Spring of Rachel Carson that aired April 3, 1963. The program included segments of Carson reading from Silent Spring and interviews with several other experts, mostly critics (including White-Stevens); according to biographer Linda Lear, \"in juxtaposition to the wild-eyed, loud-voiced Dr. Robert White-Stevens in white lab coat, Carson appeared anything but the hysterical alarmist that her critics contended.\"[76] Reactions from the estimated audience of ten to fifteen million were overwhelmingly positive, and the program spurred a congressional review of pesticide dangers and the public release of a pesticide report by the President's Science Advisory Committee.[77] Within a year or so of publication, the attacks on the book and Carson had largely lost momentum.[78][79]/nIn one of her last public appearances, Carson testified before President John F. Kennedy's Science Advisory Committee. The committee issued its report on May 15, 1963, largely backing Carson's scientific claims.[80] Following the report's release, she also testified before a United States Senate subcommittee to make policy recommendations. Though Carson received hundreds of other speaking invitations, she could not accept the great majority of them. Her health was steadily declining as her cancer outpaced the radiation therapy, with only brief periods of remission. She spoke as much as she was physically able, however, including a notable appearance on The Today Show and speeches at several dinners held in her honor. In late 1963, she received a flurry of awards and honors: the Audubon Medal (from the National Audubon Society), the Cullum Geographical Medal (from the American Geographical Society), and induction into the American Academy of Arts and Letters.[81]/nWeakened from breast cancer and her treatment regimen, Carson became ill with a respiratory virus in January 1964. Her condition worsened, and in February, doctors found that she had severe anemia from her radiation treatments. In March, they discovered that the cancer had reached her liver. She died of a heart attack on April 14, 1964, in her home in Silver Spring, Maryland.[1][82][83]/nHer body was cremated. Some of her ashes were buried beside her mother at Parklawn Memorial Gardens, Rockville, Maryland,[84] while the rest were scattered along the coast of Squirrel Island, near the Sheepscot River in Maine./nCarson bequeathed her manuscripts and papers to Yale University to take advantage of the new state-of-the-art preservations facilities of the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library. Her longtime agent and literary executor Marie Rodell spent nearly two years organizing and cataloging Carson's papers and correspondence, distributing all the letters to their senders so that only what each correspondent approved would be submitted to the archive.[85]/nIn 1965, Rodell arranged for the publication of an essay Carson had intended to expand into a book: The Sense of Wonder. The essay, which was combined with photographs by Charles Pratt and others, exhorts parents to help their children experience the \"...lasting pleasures of contact with the natural world ... available to anyone who will place himself under the influence of earth, sea, and sky and their amazing life.\"[86]/nIn addition to the letters in Always Rachel, in 1998, a volume of Carson's previously unpublished work was published as Lost Woods: The Discovered Writing of Rachel Carson, edited by Linda Lear. All of Carson's books remain in print.[86]/nCarson's work had a powerful impact on the environmental movement. Silent Spring, in particular, was a rallying point for the fledgling social movement in the 1960s. According to environmental engineer and Carson scholar H. Patricia Hynes, \"Silent Spring altered the balance of power in the world. No one since would be able to sell pollution as the necessary underside of progress so easily or uncritically.\"[87] Carson's work, and the activism it inspired, are at least partly responsible for the deep ecology movement and the overall strength of the grassroots environmental movement since the 1960s. It was also influential on the rise of ecofeminism and on many feminist scientists.[88]/nWhile there remains no evidence that Carson was openly a women's rights activist, her work and its subsequent criticisms have left an iconic legacy for the ecofeminist movement.[8] Attacks on Carson's credibility included criticism of her credentials in which she was labeled an \"amateur.\" It was said that her writing was too \"emotional.\"[8] Ecofeminist scholars argue that not only was the dissenting rhetoric gendered to paint Carson as hysterical but was done because her arguments challenged the capitalist production of large agri-business corporations.[8] Others, such as Yaakov Garb, suggest that in addition to not being a women's rights activist, Carson also had no anti-capitalist agenda and that such attacks were unwarranted.[8] Additionally, the way photos of Carson were used to portray her are often questioned because of few representations of her engaging in work typical of a scientist, but instead of her leisure activities.[8]/nCarson's most direct legacy in the environmental movement was the campaign to ban DDT in the United States (and related efforts to ban or limit its use throughout the world). Though environmental concerns about DDT had been considered by government agencies as early as Carson's testimony before the President's Science Advisory Committee, the 1967 formation of the Environmental Defense Fund was the first significant milestone in the campaign against DDT. The organization brought lawsuits against the government to \"establish a citizen's right to a clean environment,\" and the arguments employed against DDT largely mirrored Carson's. By 1972, the Environmental Defense Fund and other activist groups had succeeded in securing a phase-out of DDT use in the United States (except in emergency cases).[89]/nThe creation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by the Nixon Administration in 1970 addressed another concern that Carson had brought to light. Until then, the same agency (the USDA) was responsible both for regulating pesticides and promoting the concerns of the agriculture industry; Carson saw this as a conflict of interest since the agency was not responsible for effects on wildlife or other environmental concerns beyond farm policy. Fifteen years after its creation, one journalist described the EPA as \"the extended shadow of Silent Spring.\" Much of the agency's early work, such as enforcing the 1972 Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, was directly related to Carson's work.[90]/nIn the 1980s, the policies of the Reagan Administration emphasized economic growth, rolling back many of the environmental policies adopted in response to Carson and her work.[91]/nVarious groups ranging from government institutions to environmental and conservation organizations to scholarly societies have celebrated Carson's life and work since her death. Perhaps most significantly, on June 9, 1980, Carson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. A 17\u00a2 Great Americans series postage stamp was issued in her honor the following year; several other countries have since issued Carson postage as well.[92] In 1973, Carson was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[93]/nThe University of California, Santa Cruz, named one of its colleges (formerly known as College Eight) Rachel Carson College in 2016.[94] Rachel Carson College is the first college at the university to bear a woman's name./nMunich's Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society was founded in 2009. An international, interdisciplinary center for research and education in the environmental humanities and social sciences, it was established as a joint initiative of Munich's Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t and the Deutsches Museum, with the support of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research./nCarson's birthplace and childhood home in Springdale, Pennsylvania, now known as the Rachel Carson Homestead, became a National Register of Historic Places site and the nonprofit Rachel Carson Homestead Association was created in 1975 to manage it.[95] Her home in Colesville, Maryland where she wrote Silent Spring was named a National Historic Landmark in 1991.[96] Near Pittsburgh, a 35.7 miles (57\u00a0km) hiking trail, called the Rachel Carson Trail and maintained by the Rachel Carson Trails Conservancy, was dedicated to Carson in 1975.[97] A Pittsburgh bridge was also renamed in Carson's honor as the Rachel Carson Bridge.[98] The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection State Office Building in Harrisburg is named in her honor. Elementary schools in Gaithersburg, Montgomery County, Maryland,[99] Sammamish, Washington[100] and San Jose, California[101] were named in her honor, as were middle schools in Beaverton, Oregon,[102] Queens, New York (Rachel Carson Intermediate School) and Herndon, Virginia[103] (Rachel Carson Middle School), and a high school in Brooklyn, New York.[104]/nTwo research vessels have sailed in the United States bearing the name R/V Rachel Carson. One is on the west coast, owned by Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI),[105] and the other is on the east coast, operated by the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. Another vessel of the name, now scrapped, was a former naval vessel obtained and converted by the United States EPA. It operated on the Great Lakes. The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary also operates a mooring buoy maintenance vessel named the Rachel Carson.[106]/nThe ceremonial auditorium on the third floor of EPA headquarters, the William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building, is named after Carson. The Rachel Carson Room is close to the EPA Administrator's office. It has been the site of numerous important announcements, including the Clean Air Interstate Rule.[107]/nA number of conservation areas have been named for Carson as well. Between 1964 and 1990, 650 acres (263\u00a0ha) near Brookeville in Montgomery County, Maryland were acquired and set aside as the Rachel Carson Conservation Park, administered by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission.[108] In 1969, the Coastal Maine National Wildlife Refuge became the Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge; expansions will bring the size of the refuge to about 9,125 acres (3,693\u00a0ha).[109] In 1985, North Carolina renamed one of its estuarine reserves in honor of Carson, in Beaufort.[110][111]/nCarson is also a frequent namesake for prizes awarded by philanthropic, educational and scholarly institutions. The Rachel Carson Prize, founded in Stavanger, Norway in 1991, is awarded to women who have made a contribution in the field of environmental protection.[112] The American Society for Environmental History has awarded the Rachel Carson Prize for Best Dissertation since 1993.[113] Since 1998, the Society for Social Studies of Science has awarded an annual Rachel Carson Book Prize for \"a book length work of social or political relevance in the area of science and technology studies.\"[114] The Society of Environmental Journalists gives an annual award and two honourable mentions for books on environmental issues in Carson's name, such as was awarded to Joe Roman's Listed: Dispatches from America's Endangered Species Act[115] in 2012.[116] The Sierra Club and its foundation recognize donors who have provided for the club in their estate plans as the Rachel Carson Society.[117] The Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen (Germany) awards post-doctoral fellowships in the area of the environment and society.[118]/nThe Rachel Carson sculpture in Woods Hole, Massachusetts was unveiled on July 14, 2013.[119] Google created a Google Doodle for Carson's 107th birthday on May 27, 2014.[120] Carson was featured during the \"HerStory\" video tribute to notable women on U2's tour in 2017 for the 30th anniversary of The Joshua Tree during a performance of \"Ultraviolet (Light My Way)\"[121] from the band's 1991 album Achtung Baby./nThe centennial of Carson's birth occurred in 2007. On Earth Day (April 22), Courage for the Earth: Writers, Scientists, and Activists Celebrate the Life and Writing of Rachel Carson was released as \"a centennial appreciation of Rachel Carson's brave life and transformative writing.\" It contained thirteen essays by environmental writers and scientists.[122] Democratic Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland had intended to submit a resolution celebrating Carson for her \"legacy of scientific rigor coupled with poetic sensibility\" on the 100th anniversary of her birth. The resolution was blocked by Republican Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma.[123] The Rachel Carson Homestead Association held a May 27 birthday party and sustainable feast at her birthplace and home in Springdale, Pennsylvania, and the first Rachel Carson Legacy Conference in Pittsburgh with E. O. Wilson as keynote speaker. Both Rachel's Sustainable Feast and the conference continue as annual events./nAlso in 2007 American author Ginger Wadsworth wrote a biography of Carson.[124][125]/nCarson-related organizations", "64077185": "Vishva Mitra Dixit (born c.\u20091956) is a physician of Indian origin who is the current Vice President of Discovery Research at Genentech.[1]/nVishva Dixit was born in Kenya in 1956.[2]  His parents were both physicians, working for the British colonial authorities.[2] Dixit was interested in science from an early age, and his parents encouraged him to pursue a career in medicine.[3]  He graduated in 1980 from the University of Nairobi with a \nBachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery, becoming a medical doctor.[4][5][6]/nFollowing medical school, Dixit completed a residency in the Department of Pathology at the Washington University School of Medicine. He decided to pursue pathology because he had been interested in the process of death since childhood and pathology offered more research options across medical disciplines.[3]/nEncouraged to train in research as part of the residency program, Dixit found a position in the lab of biochemistry professor William Frazier and became involved in a project on thrombospondin, a protein in the extracellular matrix.[7] The project's success a few years later resulted in a number of publications. Congruent with his research, Dixit chose to specialize in hemostasis and thrombosis during his last year of clinical training.[7]/nIn 1986 he joined the University of Michigan Medical School Department of Pathology as an assistant professor, eventually becoming a full professor.[6] During his early years as an assistant professor, Dixit's research focused on thrombospondin. In 1994 his interests shifted and he began to reorient his research to cell death.[3]/nIn 1997, Dixit became the Director of Molecular Oncology at Genentech.[8][6] In 2009 he led the Department of Physiological Chemistry.[9] As of 2016 he held the position of Vice President of Discovery Research,[2] and oversaw Genentech's postdoctoral program.[3]/nAs one of the world's most cited scientists, some of Dixit's publications have garnered more than 2,000 citations.[3] He was the second most highly cited scientist in the world in 1996.[10] His lab's discovery of MyD88 (25) as a central conduit for signals emanating from the interleukin-1 receptor is considered as one of the \u201cPillars in Immunology\u201d by the Journal of Immunology.[11]/nDixit's papers, including his work on apoptosis and inflammation, have been designated \u201chot papers\u201d on multiple occasions by The Scientist.[12] This designation signifies emerging work that has a disproportionate impact on a field./nHis research on apoptosis (programmed cell death) is now commonly found in introductory textbooks in both biology and medicine.[7]/nWhile at the University of Michigan, he received funding from the National Institutes of Health to support research into thrombospondin, as his laboratory had shown this protein had a role in promoting cancer metastases.[3]/nIn 1991, an article in Scientific American inspired Dixit to study how tumor necrosis factors, which are responsible for the regulation of immune cells, trigger inflammation and cell death.[13]/nDixit switched research tracks and began investigating cell death mechanisms. The research identified each component of the cell-death pathway and explained how they were all connected./nIn 1996, he published the first evidence that death receptors engaged a mammalian deathase, a molecular scissors (protease) that cleaves proteins.[14] His team's work on death receptor-induced apoptosis was notable, for prior to that time, cell surface receptors were thought to signal by functioning as ion channels or altering intracellular phosphorylation. Death receptors, however, signal by a different mechanism\u2014activation of a death protease.[15]/nCollaborating with Guy Salvesen's group at the Burnham Institute, Dixit's group proposed the model of proximity-induced autoactivation in 1998 to explain how the first proteolytic signal is generated by caspase precursors recruited to death receptors.[16]/nAt Genentech, Dixit formed a team with the goal of unraveling the complex interplay between cell death and inflammation at the molecular level.[5] During his tenure, he has worked on the innate immune system, particularly its role in orchestrating an inflammatory response to fight pathogens and cancer.[17]/nIn 1999, his team discovered RIPK2 and RIPK3, which later were shown to be key mediators of NF-\u03baB signaling and necroptosis, respectively.[18] Incorrect regulation of NF-\u03baB has been linked to cancer, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and improper immune development./nDixit's work contributed to the discovery of a core complex composed of three proteins that enabled antigen receptors to activate the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway: CARD11, BCL10 and MALT1/paracaspase.[19] Furthermore, he postulated a protease activity for MALT1, which plays a role in T cell activation and MALT lymphomas.[20] His team described the family of metacaspase proteases in plants in a paper published in 2000.[20]/nIn a series of papers between 2016 and 2020, Dixit and his colleagues at Genentech also worked out the complex molecular mechanisms that regulate activity of caspase-8, OTULIN, RIPK1, RIPK3 and other proteins that modulate inflammation, apoptosis and necroptosis signaling by death receptors and TLRs.[21][22][23][24][25]/nBy 2002, Dixit was among the first scientists to demonstrate that pro-inflammatory caspases are part of a molecular complex named inflammasomes that are integral to the proper functioning of the innate immune system.[26] In particular, he defined regulatory components upstream of caspase-1 that proteolytically activate the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta and interleukin-18.[3]/nIn 2004 and 2006, Dixit provided unequivocal genetic evidence by identifying the NOD-like receptors NLRP3 and NLRC4 as proximal components of inflammasomes responsible for caspase-1 activation.[3][27] The research showed that inflammasomes distinguish between inflammatory triggers, such as differentiating between types of bacteria, through the use of different sensors./nMore specifically, the intracellular protein NLRC4 was identified as a sensor for Salmonella that triggered assembly of an inflammasome complex.[27] NLRP3 and the inflammasome adaptor ASC, on the other hand, were found to be required for activation of the inflammasome by diverse pathogenic agents, including microbial toxins, and Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus or Listeria monocytogenes./nIn 2009, his group followed up on these findings with the discovery of the first small molecule inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome.[28] Derived analogs of this sulfonylurea class of compounds are currently in clinical development for inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.[29]/nDixit's team discovered the non-canonical inflammasome pathway and its critical role in mediating lethal systemic inflammation in response to Gram-negative pathogens, detailed in three papers in 2011,[30] 2013,[31] and 2015.[32] This illuminated a new pathway to sepsis, a syndrome responsible for millions of deaths worldwide. Hence, targeting this pathway for therapeutic benefit is a substantial effort in pharmaceutical companies./nThe 2011 paper showed that mice lacking the gene that encodes caspase-1 also carry a mutation in a neighboring caspase gene, caspase-11 (caspase-4 in humans), which is responsible for many of the effects previously attributed to caspase-1, including sensitivity to sepsis.[33]/nThe 2013 paper clarified the role of Toll-like receptor 4 and caspase-11 in inducing innate immune responses to Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria. The research showed that recognition of intracellular LPS by innate immune cells leads to a form of necrotic, proinflammatory death, termed pyroptosis. They showed that these mechanisms did not depend on TLR4, but were rather mediated by caspase-11. This was significant, because for years it was assumed that TLR4 was solely responsible for cellular responses to LPS.[34]/nIn the 2015 paper, they used mice subjected to random mutation to find mediators of caspase-11-dependent non-canonical inflammasome signaling. This led to the discovery that caspase-mediated cleavage of the protein GSDMD creates a pore forming, plasma membrane disrupting amino-terminal fragment that induces pyroptosis.[35] The advances contributed to firmly establishing the sequence of events leading from inflammasome activation to pyroptosis, DAMP release, and lethal septic shock.[36]/nUsing a similar research strategy, in 2021, they reported NINJ1 to be a mediator of plasma membrane rupture and DAMP release from pyroptotic cells.[37]/nIn 1990, Dixit's lab at the University of Michigan discovered tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-inducible genes in endothelial cells, including A20/TNFAIP3.[38] In later years, A20/TNFAIP3 would also achieve prominence as a modulator of inflammation.[39]/nIn 2004, Dixit's group at Genentech discovered \u201cubiquitin editing\u201d as a damping mechanism \u00a0that attaches ubiquitin tags to TNF-receptor associated proteins to switch off pro-inflammatory signaling.[3][40]/nIn 2018, in a similar vein, his group showed that the ubiquitin-cleaving enzyme, OTULIN, regulates cell death and inflammation by removing inhibitory linear ubiquitin chains from LUBAC, an enzyme that activates NF-\u03baB.[21]/nDixit is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[41]/nIn 2016, Dixit received the Gutenberg Research Award in Mainz, Germany.[42] He also received the G.H.A.

Keasling is a professor[ambiguous] of chemical engineering and bioengineering at the University of California, Berkeley.[2] He is also associate laboratory director for biosciences at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and chief executive officer of the Joint BioEnergy Institute.[3] He is considered one of the foremost authorities in synthetic biology, especially in the field of metabolic engineering./nKeasling was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2010 for developing synthetic biology tools to engineer the antimalarial drug artemisinin./nKeasling received his bachelor's degree at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln where he was a member of Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity. He went on to complete his Doctor of Philosophy degree at the University of Michigan in 1991 under the supervision of Bernhard Palsson.[4] Keasling performed post-doctoral research with Arthur Kornberg at Stanford University in 1991\u20131992./nKeasling's current[when?] research[5] is focused on engineering chemistry inside microorganisms, an area known as metabolic engineering, for production of useful chemicals or for environmental cleanup.  In much the same way that synthetic organic and industrial chemistry has allowed chemists and chemical engineers to produce from fossil fuel resources chemicals that we use every day, metabolic engineering can revolutionize the production of some of the same useful chemicals and more from renewable resources, like sugar and cellulosic biomass. For many years, work in metabolic engineering was limited by the lack of enzymes to perform the necessary chemistry and tools to manipulate and monitor the chemistry inside cells. Seeing a need for better genetic tools, Keasling began working on genetic tool development, an area now known as synthetic biology. Keasling\u2019s laboratory has developed or adopted many of the latest analytical tools to troubleshoot our genetic manipulations. Keasling's laboratory has applied metabolic chemistry to a number of real-world problems including the production of the antimalarial drug artemisinin and drop-in biofuels. Keasling has published over 300 papers in peer-reviewed journals and has over 30 issued patents./nMalaria is a global health problem that threatens 300\u2013500 million people and kills more than one million people annually. The chloroquine-based drugs that were used widely in the past have lost effectiveness because the Plasmodium parasite that causes malaria has become resistant to them. Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide, extracted from Artemisia annua L is highly effective against Plasmodium spp. resistant to other anti-malarial drugs. However, there are several problems with current production methods for artemisinin. First, artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) are too expensive for people in the developing world to afford.[6] Second, artemisinin is extracted from A. annua, and its yield and consistency depend on climate and the extraction process. While there is a method for chemical synthesis of artemisinin, it is too low yielding and therefore too expensive for use in producing low-cost drugs. Third, although the World Health Organization has recommended that artemisinin be formulated with other active pharmaceutical ingredients in ACTs, many manufacturers are still producing mono-therapies of artemisinin, which increase the chance that Plasmodium spp. will develop resistance to artemisinin./nKeasling's laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, has engineered both Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce artemisinic acid, a precursor to artemisinin that can be derivatized using established, simple, inexpensive chemistry to form artemisinin or any artemisinin derivative currently used to treat malaria.[7] The microorganisms were engineered with a ten-enzyme biosynthetic pathway using genes from Artemisia annua, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Escherichia coli (twelve genes in all) to transform a simple and renewable sugar, like glucose, into the complicated chemical structure of the anti-malarial drug artemisinin. The engineered microorganism is capable of secreting the final product from the cell, thereby purifying it from all other intracellular chemicals and reducing the purification costs and therefore the cost of the final drug.  Given the existence of known, relatively high-yielding chemistry for the conversion of artemisinic acid to artemisinin or any other artemisinin derivative, microbially-produced artemisinic acid is a viable, renewable, and scalable source of this potent family of anti-malarial drugs.[8]/nA critical element of Keasling's work was the development of genetic tools to aid in the manipulation of microbial metabolism, particularly for low-value products that require high yields from sugar.His laboratory developed single-copy plasmids for the expression of complex metabolic pathways, promoter systems that allow regulated control of transcription consistently in all cells of a culture, mRNA stabilization technologies to regulate the stability of mRNA segments,[9] and a protein engineering approach to attach several enzymes of a metabolic pathway onto a synthetic protein scaffold to increase pathway flux.[10] These and other gene expression tools now enable precise control of the expression of the genes that encode novel metabolic pathways to maximize chemical production, to minimize losses to side products, and minimize the accumulation of toxic intermediates that may poison the microbial host, all of which are important for economical production of this important drug./nAnother critical aspect of Keasling's work was discovering the chemistry and enzymes in Artemisia annua responsible for synthesis of artemisinin.[11][12] These enzymes included the cytochrome P450 that oxidizes amorphadiene to artemisinic acid and the redox partners that transfer reducing equivalents from the enzyme to cofactors. The discovery of these enzymes and their functional expression in both yeast and E. coli, along with the other nine enzymes in the metabolic pathway, allowed production of artemisinic acid by these two microorganisms.[12][13] S. cerevisiae was chosen for the large-scale production process and was further engineered to improve artemisinic acid production.[14]/nKeasling's microbial production process has a number of advantages over extraction from plants. First, microbial synthesis will reduce the cost of artemisinin, the most expensive component of artemisinin-based combination therapies\u2014by as much as tenfold\u2014and therefore make artemisinin-derived anti-malarial drugs more affordable to people in the developing world. Second, weather conditions or political climates that might otherwise affect the yield or cost of the plant-derived version of the drug will not affect the microbial source for the drug. Third, microbial production of artemisinin in large tanks will allow for more careful distribution of artemisinin to legitimate drug manufacturers that formulate artemisinin combination therapies, rather than monotherapies. This will, in turn, slow the development of resistance to this drug. Fourth, severe shortages of plant-derived artemisinin are projected for 2011 and beyond, which will increase the cost of artemisinin combination therapies. Finally, microbially-derived artemisinic acid will enable production of new derivatives of artemisinin that Plasmodium may not be resistant to, thereby extending the time over which artemisinin may be used./nTo ensure that the process he developed would benefit people in the developing world, Keasling assembled a unique team consisting of his laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, Amyris Biotechnologies ( a company founded on this technology) and the Institute for OneWorld Health (a non-profit pharmaceutical company located in San Francisco). In addition to assembling the team, Keasling developed an intellectual property model to ensure that microbially-sourced artemisinin could be offered as inexpensively as possible to people in the developing world: patents granted from his work at UCB are licensed royalty free to Amyris Biotechnologies and the Institute for OneWorld Health for use in producing artemisinin so long as they do not make a profit on artemisinin sold in the developing world. The team was funded in December 2004 by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop the microbial production process. The science was completed in December 2007. In 2008, Sanofi-Aventis licensed the technology and worked with Amyris to develop the production process. Sanofi-Aventis has produced 35 tons[when?] of artemisinin using Keasling\u2019s microbial production process, which is enough for 70 million treatments. Distribution of artemisinin combination therapies containing the microbially-sourced artemisinin began in August 2014 with 1.7 million treatments shipped to Africa. It is anticipated that 100-150 million treatments will be produced using this technology and shipped annually to Africa, Asia and South America./nRenewable fuels are needed for all modes of transportation but most microbially-sourced fuels can be used only as a small fraction of gasoline in conventional spark-ignition engines. Keasling\u2019s laboratory has engineered microorganisms to produce hydrocarbons with similar properties to the fuels now derived from petroleum. These fuels are synthesized from plant-derived sugars, such as cellulose feedstock, which is of little economic value. Consequently, microbes can minimize the carbon footprint by minimizing the energy expenditure in sourcing fuel, such off-shore drilling and hydraulic fracturing./nKeasling and his colleagues demonstrated that Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be engineered to produce the fatty acid-based biofuels fatty acid ethyl esters,[15] alkenes,[16] and methyl ketones.[17] As linear hydrocarbons are the key components of diesel, these biologically produced fuels are excellent diesel replacements. However, fuels containing only long, linear, hydrocarbon chains will freeze under cold conditions. To develop fuels suitable for cold applications, Keasling's laboratory engineered E. coli and S. cerevisiae to produce branched and cyclic hydrocarbons using the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway: isopentanol, a drop-in replacement for gasoline;[18] pinene, a replacement for jet fuel;[19] and bisabolene, a replacement for diesel fuel.[20] Because isoprenoids add a methyl side chain every four carbons in the backbone, fuels made from isoprenoids have very low freeze and cloud points, making them suitable as cold-weather diesels and jet fuels./nOne of the biggest challenges in scaling up microbial fermentations is the stability of the microbial strain: the engineered microorganism will attempt to mutate or shed the metabolic pathway, in part because intermediates in the metabolic pathway accumulate and are toxic to the cells. To balance pathway flux and reduce the cost of producing a desired biofuel, Keasling's laboratory developed dynamic regulators to sense the levels of intermediates in the pathway and regulate pathway activity.[21] These regulators stabilized the pathway and the cell and improved biofuel yields making it possible to grow the engineered cells in large-scale fermentation tanks for fuel production./nMany of the best fuels and chemicals are toxic to the producer organism. One way to limit fuel toxicity is to actively pump the fuel from the cell. To identify pumps ideally suited for a particular fuel, Keasling and his colleagues bioprospected environmental microorganisms for many, different, three-component transporters and selected for the pumps most effective for a particular fuel.[22] These transporters allowed E. coli to grow in the presence of the fuels and, as a result, produce more of the target fuel than it would have been able to do so in the absence of the transporter./nThe starting materials (generally sugars) are the most significant factor in the biofuel production cost. Cellulose, a potentially low-cost starting material, must be depolymerized into sugars by adding an expensive cocktail of enzymes. One way to reduce this cost is to engineer the fuel-producing microbe to also produce the enzymes to depolymerize cellulose and hemicellulose. Recently, Keasling's laboratory demonstrated that a microorganism could be engineered to synthesize and secrete enzymes to depolymerize cellulose and hemicellulose into sugars and to produce a gasoline replacement (butanol), a diesel-fuel replacement (fatty acid ethyl ester), or a jet fuel replacement (pinene).[23]/nAs a technological platform, biofuel manufacturing faces huge economic hurdles many of which depend on the market pricing of crude oil and other conventionally sourced fuels.

Previous studies had only shown success in the lac operon, but the lambda phage was successful for the arabinose operon in her testing.[5] Gottesman's later research at the National Institutes of Health used this lambda phage to understand how bacteriophages are able to insert themselves into a bacterial chromosome and then subsequently remove themselves.[5]/nSusan Gottesman is known for her work with small RNAs and ATP-dependent proteases.[5] Her work in these subjects has been celebrated by scientists such as Princeton University professor Thomas Silhavy and former Princeton professor David Botstein.[5] Gottesman focused her research on E. coli cells and the process of gene regulation.[1] She began studying the mechanism for energy-dependent proteolysis, but stumbled upon small RNAs in the process.[1] Small RNA are short RNA sequences that have a wide variety of functions within cells.[10] They have been shown to be vital in cell processes such as growth, cell differentiation, and defense.

Wagner devoted three years (1836\u20131839) to the exploration of Algiers:[1] it was here that he made important observations in natural history, which he later supplemented and developed: that geographical isolation could play a key role in speciation./nFrom 1852 to 1855, together with Carl Scherzer, Wagner travelled through North and Central America and the Caribbean. In May 1843, Wagner toured the Lake Sevan region of Armenia with Armenian writer Khachatur Abovian.[2] He committed suicide[how?] in Munich, aged 73.[citation needed] His brother Rudolf was a physiologist and anatomist./nWagner's early career was as a geographer, and he published a number of geographical books about North Africa, the Middle East, and Tropical America. He was also a keen naturalist and collector, and it is for this work he is best known among biologists. Ernst Mayr, the evolutionist and historian of biology, has given an account of Wagner's significance.[3]p562\u2013565. However, others disagree with this account.[4] During his three years in Algeria, he (amongst other activities) studied the flightless beetles Pimelia and Melasoma. In these genera, a number of species are each confined to a stretch of the north coast between rivers which descend from the Atlas mountains to the Mediterranean. As soon as one crosses a river, a different but closely related species appears.[5]/nWagner made similar observations in the Caucasus and in the Andean valleys, leading him to conclude, after the Origin of Species had been published:[6]/nThis was an early description of the process of geographic speciation by means of the founder effect. Another formulation of this idea came later: \"Organisms which never leave their ancient area of distribution will never change\".[7]/nWagner's idea met with a mixed reception. \"Unfortunately, Wagner combined [his idea] with some peculiar ideas on variation and selection\" (Mayr). The leading evolutionists (Darwin, Wallace, Weismann) attacked Wagner's idea of geographic speciation, and it suffered a long decline until in 1942 it was reintroduced by Mayr.[8] The importance of geographic speciation became one of the core ideas of the evolutionary synthesis.[9]/nSome modern experts such as Ernst Mayr, Jerry Coyne and H. Allen Orr,[10] argue that Wagner pioneered the idea of geographical speciation, and that Darwin had not appreciated it. However, Wagner's \"migration theory\" was based on a rather simple, Lamarckian idea of evolution. Wagner argued in letters to Darwin that the latter had missed a vital geographic component in understanding the evolution of new species. Darwin at first responded in a friendly way to these letters, and agreed that geographic isolation was important (although not the only cause of speciation), and pointed out that he had in fact dealt with geographic speciation in The Origin of Species. Wagner in his later articles totally rejected the importance of natural selection. He again pointed out the importance of intercrossing in preventing divergence, and thus for geographic separation in allowing divergence. Wagner argued that Darwin had not understood this, although these ideas are present in The Origin of Species.[4] Darwin found Wagner's increasingly hysterical tone and one-sided argument upsetting, and wrote across his copy of Wagner's 1875 paper \"most wretched rubbish.\"/nAs well as Darwin, the Reverend J.T. Gulick also found Wagner's theories overstated.[11] Gulick was apparently responding to David Starr Jordan, who approved of Wagner's geographic speciation ideas in a paper which is often cited as providing early support of geographical speciation.[12] Jordan later wrote a brief note of correction agreeing with some of Gulick's criticisms:/nIn a later paper Gulick says that \"Moritz Wagner, in his 'Law of the Migration of Organisms,' was the first to insist on the importance of geographical isolation as a factor in evolution, but when he asserted that without geographical isolation natural selection could have no effect in producing new species he went beyond what could be sustained by facts\".[14]/nMayr's formulation has been argued to have cleared up issues which Wagner had left unresolved: \"A new species develops if a population which has become isolated from its parental species acquires during this period of isolation characters which promote or guarantee isolation when the external barriers break down\".[8] The zoological taxonomist Bernhard Rensch was also significant in keeping geographical speciation on the evolutionary menu.[15][16] He identified geographical separation as the most frequent initial step towards cladogenesis (phylogenetic branching). However, a variety of species concepts compete with Mayr's isolation concept of species today, and so Mayr's account can no longer be accepted to be the gold standard (disambiguation)./nThe importance of Wagner's insight is highly debatable today, as it is clear that geographical isolation is not the only mechanism which causes species-splitting. Furthermore, it is generally accepted that natural selection is the most important cause of speciation, even when the geographical milieu is in isolation.[10][17] There is room for debate as to whether Charles Darwin had reached a similar conclusion at the same time. The Origin of Species was published nearly twenty years after Wagner's first account, but more relevant is the evidence of his notebooks. The evidence of Darwin's notebooks (which were not published until the mid-20th century) shows a \"clear description of reproductive isolation, maintained by ethological [behavioural] isolating mechanisms\"[3]p266; the same ideas are also present in The Origin of Species, but are often not recognized as such by modern biologists.[4] On the other hand, there is no single example in the notebooks quite so clear as Wagner's flightless beetles. Much of the good in Wagner's ideas is masked by his other, mistaken, beliefs,[18] but his inferences about geographical speciation were important insights gained by observation of insects in their natural habitats./nBut again, see Sulloway's article.[4] Speciation isn't just about geography, it is more important that it requires splitting that endures in spite of geographic overlap./nMoritz Wagner is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of venomous snake, Montivipera wagneri.[20]", "61095365": "John Henry Salter (1862 \u2013 5 August 1942) was an English naturalist and ornithologist.

Missense variants cause around half the genetic changes that are known to cause disease. They used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate C. elegans equivalent\u00a0human missense mutants. They compared the phenotypes from the missense mutants to the wildtype and known loss-of-function mutant controls in the autism-associated missense alleles. They found that 70% of missense alleles showed evident phenotypic changes in locomotion, morphology, and fecundity. They used this method to show subtle phenotypic changes and the effect that missense mutations can have on human disease.

They found that the death of Z4.pp is what probably prevents the posterior ovary in P. redivivus from developing which in C. elegans controls the development of that posterior ovary. This is thought to be the reason why there is a gross difference in the morphology of the P.redivivus female gonads and the C.elegans hermaphrodite.[6]/n\"Postembryonic nongonadal cell lineages of the nematode Panagrellus redivivus: Description and comparison with those of Caenorhabditis elegans\" (1982) Horvitz and Sternberg looked at the postembryonic nongonodal cell lineages of P.redivivus and compared it to C.elegans.

Ablation of the gonads in these two nematodes causes vulval precursor cell death.

He marked his arrival into the world of insect science through a sole-authored short communication in Nature journal titled, Metabolic effects of corpus allatum hormone, in the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria.[2]/nUpon his return to Kenya, Prof. Odhiambo, took up a position as a lecturer in the Department of Zoology at the University of Nairobi. In 1967, he was approached by the Science journal to write a review on the status of science in Africa.[3] In the article, Prof. Odhiambo observed that scientific research was urgently required in the then postcolonial Africa, to develop environmentally safe strategies to increase agricultural production, and to address prevalent tropical and vector borne diseases. He stressed that the science conducted in Africa should have at its heart the elevation of the livelihoods of smallholder farmers./nAt the same time, Prof. Odhiambo noted, the indigenous scientific community in Africa was \u2018woefully small\u2019, and the continent was hardly equipped, from a financial and infrastructural point of view, to effectively tackle the challenges at hand. He, therefore, proposed that Africa's best long term solution towards conducting effective research was to concentrate efforts in a few centres of excellence./nGiving the example that eventually led to the establishment of icipe, Prof. Odhiambo recommended that Africa's insect research could be located in one centre that would have the best equipment, which would be put to the best advantage. Such a centre would have a permanent staff; it would also train young researchers from Africa and offer opportunities to other scientists from across the globe looking for \u2018periodical renovation\u2019. In Prof Odhiambo's words, the insect science centre of excellence would become \u2018a powerhouse for the initiated and those wishing to be initiated into research\u2019./nProf. Odhiambo's ideas got support from, among others, Carl Djerassi, a world-renowned American scientist. Together, Odhiambo and Djerassi set the wheels in motion for the launching of icipe. Eventually, they gained the support of 21 national academies of science across the globe, who became sponsors of icipe, providing the needed external research directors./nicipe was declared open for business in 1970, one of its objectives being the creation of motivated and highly talented \u2018human capital\u2019 in insect research and related areas of science, to enable Africa to sustain herself and to lead the entire pan-tropical world in this area of endeavour./nProf. Odhiambo later remarked: \u201cThe idea was actually very simple, get the very best people and then if you have more money, put buildings and equipment around them.\u201d/nIn the beginning money was in short supply at icipe, and the Centre's headquarters consisted of a number of rented wood-frame barracks perched on the hillside of Chiromo Campus at the University of Nairobi. The first postdoctoral researcher arrived to work in a garage that flooded when it rained and the budget was improvised from week to week./nToday, icipe stands as a centre of scientific excellence and training in Africa. And as Prof. Odhiambo had hoped, it is indeed staffed mainly by indigenous African scientists. icipe currently has a staff of more than 400, and the Centre collaborates with over 200 national systems, research institutes and universities around the world./nProf. Odhiambo's vision of holistic science is today embodied in the Centre's 4Hs paradigm, denoting human, animal, plant and environmental health. Its major research areas include disease vectors, such as mosquitoes and tsetse, as well as pests of cereals and horticultural crops. icipe scientists are also conducting research into beneficial insects such as bees and silkworm moths.[4]", "60177902": "Lynn L.

He was named in 2002 as a counsellor for biosciences and biotechnologies matters by the European Commission. Head of French laboratories specialized in biomedical sciences between years 1984 and 2007, he was elected President of the Paris Descartes University in December 2007, as the sole candidate./nKahn is known in France for his appearances in the media where he attempts to explain genetics and ethics to the public. As a civil servant, he was the head of the committee in charge of genetically modified crops for Europe./nKahn, the editor of French biomedical journal (M\u00e9decine/Sciences; 2005 Impact Factor: 0.541), said in 1999 that \"80 to 90 percent of what is published [in scientific journals] is of little real interest\" and most journals are consulted infrequently.[2]/nKahn has said that Oxford biologist Richard Dawkins's view of the \"selfish gene\" and genetic determinism is incorrect, saying: \"Personally, I am strongly against the theory of ultra-genetic determinism and the Dawkins theory of 'the egoistic gene'.\"[3]/nIn 2004, Kahn signed a petition and threatened to resign from his post as head of the Paris-based, publicly financed Cochin Institute, due to cuts in government spending on research.[4]/nKahn was against germline gene therapies, saying that they have no therapeutical value, and he was working to outlaw them worldwide through the World Health Organization.[5]/nHe has said of stem cells as a therapy, \"Science alone is not sufficient for making decisions on stem cells, but we cannot discuss the ethical issues\nwithout clarifying the scientific facts.\"[6]/nKahn has said that embryos which are kept frozen after in vitro fertilization procedures and will be destroyed anyway should be used for scientific advances, because whether or not the embryo has the potential to be human, at that point its only fate is to be used for research or destruction and its only chance to contribute to a \"human project\" is to help with scientific research. This view (Kahn referred to himself as a humanist) has been viewed by some religious theorists as disrespectful of the embryos.[citation needed]/nIn 1995, Kahn was a notable opponent of intracytoplasmic sperm injection, which he saw as an experimental treatment not to be used by those with infertility, which was not serious enough to justify the risks he perceived the procedure as having.[7]/nKahn has also spoken out against family members carrying children for other family members who are infertile. In speaking out against the case of a 62-year-old Frenchwoman who gave birth after being implanted in the United States with the sperm of her brother, Kahn protested what he called \"social incest\" and continued, \"The most important thing is that doctors were involved in this process, and they did it because they were paid handsomely.\"[8]/nKahn has said: \"But, from the ethical point of view, I'm totally opposed -for some reasons- to the legitimisation of the cloning-based reproduction of human beings. This authorisation would entitle some individuals to create human beings in their own image\u2026 This kind of subjection -even though it is only corporal- is intolerable. What could give somebody the right to choose the sex, the eyes' or hair's colour, the chin's shape or any other characteristic of a human being? As a consequence, I see no reason for legitimating reproductive cloning. As regards therapeutic cloning, a problem can be pointed out: before making a supposedly therapeutic cloning, a human-cloning technique must be found.\"[3]/nHe has also said that therapeutic cloning simply will not work.[3]/nKahn has said that there can be no lasting state of Israel in its current location - \"Demography, law and the uneasy conscience of the West preclude it.\"[9] He has called for the boycott of Israeli products.[10]/nKahn died of bone cancer on 6 July 2021 in Paris at the age of 76.[11]", "52018729": "Umesh Varshney (born 1957) is an Indian molecular biologist, academician and the head of a laboratory at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru.[1] He is a J.

Since the 1990s, her work has shifted toward the study of the impact of salmon farming on Canadian wild salmon./nAlexandra Bryant Hubbard was born on July 13, 1957, in Sharon, Connecticut. In her memoir, Listening to Whales, she said of her birthplace, \"I can't imagine a more whaleless environment.\"[1] Her father was an artist and her mother was writer Barbara Marx Hubbard. Her maternal grandfather was toy maker Louis Marx. Hubbard said that her passion for animals came from the time when she would explore the woods with her brother.\nIn 1977, Morton started working with psychonaut John C. Lilly as a volunteer in the Human/Dolphin Society. She catalogued 2,000 audio recordings of bottlenose dolphins. She then graduated with a diploma from the American University.[2]/nWhile in California, Morton studied the communications of dolphins at Marineland of the Pacific in Palos Verdes. When she realized there were too many individuals in the tanks and that bottlenose dolphins were too quick to record their behaviour, Morton decided to shift her study towards Marineland's pair of killer whales, Orky and Corky, whom she had previously called \"boring\" because they spent long periods of time floating at the surface while calling back and forth to each other.  Morton observed the pair when the female gave birth to the first orca conceived in captivity. She was interested in studying how baby orcas acquired new language. However, the calf died and none of Corky's other babies survived more than 45 days. Following the passing of each of the calves Morton recorded from Corky a behaviour that closely resembled mourning. The young mother lay on the bottom of the tank repeating the same calls over and over, stopping only to gulp another breath of air.  The calls became raspy as the whale vocalized day and night. Morton also discovered that orcas invented games to distract themselves. One, the \"Double Layout\", consisted in Orky and Corky lying on their backs, putting their flukes on the platform next to the tank and raising their right flipper simultaneously. The most interesting behavior was the dawn greeting where both whales pressed their tongues against the tank wall where the first shaft of sunlight hit./nIn 1979, Morton contacted pioneering killer whale researcher Michael Bigg who told her Corky and Orky had come from A5 Pod in northwestern British Columbia. He knew this from photographs of their capture as he could see the terrified young Corky pressed against the side of her mother. Dr. Bigg had photos of Corky's mother and her sisters and he knew they visited Johnstone Strait every summer near Alert Bay, British Columbia. Morton spent her summer there and found A5 pod as well as other killer whale families. The next summer, she returned to British Columbia and met Robin Morton. Alexandra Morton then permanently shifted her study to wild killer whales. Morton and her husband moved onto a boat so that they could easily follow whales. To support their work, Morton and her husband rented out their boat for tourists and researchers. In 1984, while following the A12 matriline in Northeastern Vancouver Island, Morton came across the village of Echo Bay, British Columbia, in the Broughton Archipelago.[3] She and her husband decided to settle there to pursue their study of wild killer whales./nIn 1973, Michael Bigg developed a pioneering photo identification system consisting of photographing the dorsal fin and saddle patch of each killer whale encountered in Pacific Northwest waters. Starting in 1975, Bigg and his colleagues began assembling catalogues containing the genealogical tree of every killer whale family in British Columbia and an ID photo of each orca. Since arriving in the Broughton Archipelago, Morton has been one of the main contributors to theses catalogues, providing ID photos of northern resident as well as of transient killer whales./nFor many years, only resident killer whales were intensely studied, as their predictable behaviour and highly stable social structure enabled researchers to follow them easily over a whole summer. Transients, however, have erratic route patterns which make them difficult to study. However, the Broughton Archipelago where Morton lived was frequented by many transient groups and since the mid eighties, Morton has been conducting the study of this little known community. One of her main findings has been that the differences in feeding habits between residents and transients lead each community to different lifestyles and behaviours. Transients, now named Biggs whales, eat only warm-blooded prey while residents eat only fish. She noted that transients, unlike residents, are mostly silent. As their mammalian prey have very good hearing, vocalizing could alert them of the predators approaching. Moreover, the seals and sea lions' good eyesight and their ability to teach their offspring make it imperative for transients to swim as stealthily as possible, thus explaining the transients' longer dives than residents and their habit of hiding their breath and clicks (used for echolocation) among other noises present in the sea. One transient Morton knew well used to hide behind her boat to avoid being detected by potential prey. In 1987, Morton expanded her study to pacific white-sided dolphins which had come back to the archipelago three years prior.[4] In 2010 she won the Women of Discovery Sea Award.[5]/nIn 1981, Morton founded Lore Quest (renamed Raincoast Research Society). Its original purpose was, according to its website, to \"conduct year-round research on the acoustics of the orca of the British Columbia coast\".[6] Over the years, Raincoast Research has also been involved in making identification catalogues of the Pacific-White-Sided Dolphin population in British Columbia. Following the expansion of the salmon farming industry in the Broughton Archipelago, Raincoast Research Society has been a leader in studies on the impact of salmon farming and has provided support for a number of field workers and scientists interested in this subject./nThrough Raincoast Research Society Morton has published extensively on the impact of sea lice from salmon farms on wild salmon. In 2011, Morton began the controversial work of tracking three European salmon farm virus in British Columbia, Canada, publishing in 2013 on the piscine reovirus.[7]/nNet-pen salmon farms arrived in British Columbia in the 1970s but began to proliferate by the late 1980s. By 2000, 90% of salmon farms in the province were Norwegian owned and contained Atlantic salmon. Since then, the salmon farming industry has grown, notably in the Broughton Archipelago. In the mid-2000s corporate giant Mitsubishi bought Cermaq, a company operating many salmon farms in BC.[8]/nMorton began to study the effects salmon farming brings to the coast of British Columbia, particularly to wild salmon populations, which experienced major declines in the years following the introduction of salmon farms in the area./nOn May 12, 2015, Morton, as Director of Pacific Coast Wild Salmon Society, released a 24-page booklet, Salmon Confidential: The ugly truth about Canada's open-net salmon farms. The booklet makes the case that the wild-salmon-focused economy of British Columbia far outweighs the contributions of salmon farms. The booklet explores the issues of sea lice, impacts on lobster fisheries, challenges to bio-security, salmon viruses, exotic species, and the local economy. Director Twyla Roscovich's film of the same name and topic, Salmon Confidential, won the Best Canadian Environmental Documentary Award at the 2013 Vancouver International Film Festival,.[9] The film also had 1,517,446 views by May 8, 3013 on You Tube.[10] It was also licensed by The Green Channel in 2018 [11]/nIn the spring of 2010, Morton helped found the social movement Salmon Are Sacred to raise awareness of the value of salmon to society.[12]/nIn Dec 2020, Morton's research contributed to a decision by Canada's federal fisheries and oceans department to phase out all salmon farms in the narrow passages between Vancouver Island and the mainland, as their diseases were found to be decimating the native wild Pacific salmon with sea lice and viruses.[13]/nMorton initiated two petitions, one called \"Refuse to expand the salmon farming industry in BC\", the other called \"Divest Dirty Salmon\". The first is to ask the Canadian government to stop allowing the expansion of salmon farms in British Columbia. The second is the ask Norwegian government to divest from salmon farming.[14]/nIn May 2013, Ecojustice lawyers, on behalf of Alexandra Morton, filed a lawsuit in Federal Court against the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) and Marine Harvest Canada Inc. The lawsuit was filed after learning that fish later confirmed to be infected with the piscine reovirus (PRV) had been transferred into an open-pen fish farm operated by Marine Harvest in Shelter Bay, BC.[15] On May 6, 2015, the Court sided with Morton and struck down aquaculture licence conditions that allowed private companies to transfer fish infected with viruses to open-pen farms in the ocean.[16]/nMorton ran as a candidate of the Green Party of British Columbia in the Oct 24, 2020 provincial general election, coming in third, with 19.26% of the vote.[17]", "35995199": "Richard \"Dick\" Gordon (born November 6, 1943) is an American theoretical biologist.

He was awarded the title of emeritus in 2001 and is attached to the Functional Ecology and Environment Laboratory (ECOLAB).[3]/nHenri D\u00e9camps first worked on the ecology of aquatic insects of the order Trichoptera, highlighting the influence of the vegetation cover of drainage basins on the diversity of aquatic fauna in mountain streams in the Pyrenees.[4] He then participated in the study of planktonic algal blooms in the Lot River, and identified the causes and consequences of this phenomenon.[5] This work led him to launch two cooperative projects: \"large rivers\" within the framework of PIREN (CNRS's Environmental Research Programme) and \"ecotones\" within the framework of UNESCO's Man and Biosphere (MAB) programme.[6] In 1980, he was appointed Director of the CNRS Vegetation Map Service, with the mission of developing this service laboratory into an ecological research laboratory. He then created a team on the study of riverside corridors, in collaboration with the University of Washington in Seattle. This approach has led to several publications on the structure and functioning of river ecosystems.[7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18] It demonstrates the importance of riparian areas as an interface for exchanges between running water ecosystems and neighbouring terrestrial ecosystems, leading to a better understanding of the dynamics of riparian vegetation cover, the decomposition of their litter and their role in recycling carbon and nitrogen into floodplains. These results have played an important role in the development of two key concepts in landscape ecology: the concepts of corridor and connectivity, which are particularly used in conservation biology. In his book \"Ecologie du paysage\", written with Odile D\u00e9camps, he presents a synthesis of advances in landscape ecology and introduces the notion of Panarchy and sketches a synthesis between multiple approaches to landscape (in particular that of landscape ecologists in relation to that of landscape ecology)./nElected to the French Academy of sciences, Henri D\u00e9camps directed a report on extreme weather events,[19] which led him to participate in the drafting of the IPCC special report on this issue.[20] His most recent work focuses on issues related to the development of scientific ecology.[21][22][23][24][25]/nHenri D\u00e9camps was a member of the National Committee for Scientific Research at the CNRS. He has chaired various research committees within the framework of the environmental programmes of the CNRS, the Ministry of the Environment and UNESCO. He also chaired the International Association for Landscape Ecology (IALE), the Scientific Council of the Adour-Garonne Basin Committee and the Public Interest Group \"Forest Ecosystems - GIP ECOFOR\"./nThe S\u00e9nouillac school in the Tarn has been named after him since 2014[26] and the coll\u00e8ge des Trois Vall\u00e9es in Salies du Salat, Haute-Garonne, adopted him as the sponsor of its \"La Main \u00e0 la p\u00e2te\" school project in 2018.[27]", "15941": "Jean-Jacques Rousseau (UK: /\u02c8ru\u02d0so\u028a/, US: /ru\u02d0\u02c8so\u028a/[1][2] French: [\u0292\u0251\u0303 \u0292ak \u0281uso]; 28 June 1712 \u2013 2 July 1778) was a Genevan philosopher (philosophe), writer, and composer. His political philosophy influenced the progress of the Age of Enlightenment throughout Europe, as well as aspects of the French Revolution and the development of modern political, economic, and educational thought.[3]/nHis Discourse on Inequality, which argues that private property is the source of inequality, and The Social Contract, which outlines the basis for a legitimate political order, are cornerstones in modern political and social thought. Rousseau's sentimental novel Julie, or the New Heloise (1761) was important to the development of preromanticism and romanticism in fiction.[4][5] His Emile, or On Education (1762) is an educational treatise on the place of the individual in society. Rousseau's autobiographical writings\u2014the posthumously published Confessions (completed in 1770), which initiated the modern autobiography, and the unfinished Reveries of the Solitary Walker (composed 1776\u20131778)\u2014exemplified the late 18th-century \"Age of Sensibility\", and featured an increased focus on subjectivity and introspection that later characterized modern writing./nRousseau was born in Geneva, which was at the time a city-state and a Protestant associate of the Swiss Confederacy (now a canton of Switzerland). Since 1536, Geneva had been a Huguenot republic and the seat of Calvinism. Five generations before Rousseau, his ancestor Didier, a bookseller who may have published Protestant tracts, had escaped persecution from French Catholics by fleeing to Geneva in 1549, where he became a wine merchant.[6][7]/nRousseau was proud that his family, of the moyen order (or middle-class), had voting rights in the city. Throughout his life, he generally signed his books \"Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Citizen of Geneva\".[8]/nGeneva, in theory, was governed democratically by its male voting \"citizens\". The citizens were a minority of the population when compared to the immigrants (\"inhabitants\") and their decendants (\"natives\"). In fact, rather than being run by vote of the \"citizens\", the city was ruled by a small number of wealthy families that made up the Council of Two Hundred; they delegated their power to a 25-member executive group from among them called the \"Little Council\"./nThere was much political debate within Geneva, extending down to the tradespeople. Much discussion was over the idea of the sovereignty of the people, of which the ruling class oligarchy was making a mockery. In 1707, a democratic reformer named Pierre Fatio protested this situation, saying \"a sovereign that never performs an act of sovereignty is an imaginary being\".[9] He was shot by order of the Little Council. Jean-Jacques Rousseau's father, Isaac, was not in the city at this time, but Jean-Jacques's grandfather supported Fatio and was penalized for it.[8]/nRousseau's father, Isaac Rousseau, followed his grandfather, father and brothers into the watchmaking business. He also taught dance for a short period. Isaac, notwithstanding his artisan status, was well educated and a lover of music. Rousseau wrote that \"A Genevan watchmaker is a man who can be introduced anywhere; a Parisian watchmaker is only fit to talk about watches\".[8][note 1]/nIn 1699, Isaac ran into political difficulty by entering a quarrel with visiting English officers, who in response drew their swords and threatened him. After local officials stepped in, it was Isaac who was punished, as Geneva was concerned with maintaining its ties to foreign powers.[10]/nRousseau's mother, Suzanne Bernard Rousseau, was from an upper-class family. She was raised by her uncle Samuel Bernard, a Calvinist preacher. He cared for Suzanne after her father, Jacques, who had run into trouble with the legal and religious authorities for fornication and having a mistress, died in his early 30s.[10] In 1695, Suzanne had to answer charges that she had attended a street theater disguised as a peasant woman so she could gaze upon M. Vincent Sarrasin, whom she fancied despite his continuing marriage. After a hearing, she was ordered by the Genevan Consistory to never interact with him again. She married Rousseau's father at the age of 31. Isaac's sister had married Suzanne's brother eight years earlier, after she had become pregnant and they had been chastised by the Consistory. The child died at birth. The young Rousseau was told a fabricated story about the situation in which young love had been denied by a disapproving patriarch but later prevailed, resulting in two marriages uniting the families on the same day. Rousseau never learnt the truth.[11]/nRousseau was born on 28 June 1712, and he would later relate: \"I was born almost dying, they had little hope of saving me\". He was baptized on 4 July 1712, in the great cathedral. His mother died of puerperal fever nine days after his birth, which he later described as \"the first of my misfortunes\".[12]/nHe and his older brother Fran\u00e7ois were brought up by their father and a paternal aunt, also named Suzanne. When Rousseau was five, his father sold the house that the family had received from his mother's relatives. While the idea was that his sons would inherit the principal when grown up and he would live off the interest in the meantime, in the end the father took most of the substantial proceeds. With the selling of the house, the Rousseau family moved out of the upper-class neighborhood and moved into an apartment house in a neighborhood of craftsmen\u2014silversmiths, engravers, and other watchmakers. Growing up around craftsmen, Rousseau would later contrast them favorably to those who produced more aesthetic works, writing \"those important persons who are called artists rather than artisans, work solely for the idle and rich, and put an arbitrary price on their baubles\".[13] Rousseau was also exposed to class politics in this environment, as the artisans often agitated in a campaign of resistance against the privileged class running Geneva./nRousseau had no recollection of learning to read, but he remembered how when he was five or six his father encouraged his love of reading:/nEvery night, after supper, we read some part of a small collection of romances [adventure stories], which had been my mother's. My father's design was only to improve me in reading, and he thought these entertaining works were calculated to give me a fondness for it; but we soon found ourselves so interested in the adventures they contained, that we alternately read whole nights together and could not bear to give over until at the conclusion of a volume. Sometimes, in the morning, on hearing the swallows at our window, my father, quite ashamed of this weakness, would cry, \"Come, come, let us go to bed; I am more a child than thou art.\" (Confessions, Book 1)/nRousseau's reading of escapist stories (such as L'Astr\u00e9e by Honor\u00e9 d'Urf\u00e9) had an effect on him; he later wrote that they \"gave me bizarre and romantic notions of human life, which experience and reflection have never been able to cure me of\".[14][page\u00a0needed] After they had finished reading the novels, they began to read a collection of ancient and modern classics left by his mother's uncle. Of these, his favorite was Plutarch's Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans, which he would read to his father while he made watches. Rousseau saw Plutarch's work as another kind of novel\u2014the noble actions of heroes\u2014and he would act out the deeds of the characters he was reading about. In his Confessions, Rousseau stated that the reading of Plutarch's works and \"the conversations between my father and myself to which it gave rise, formed in me the free and republican spirit\".[15]/nWitnessing the local townsfolk participate in militias made a big impression on Rousseau. Throughout his life, he would recall one scene where, after the volunteer militia had finished its manoeuvres, they began to dance around a fountain and most of the people from neighboring buildings came out to join them, including him and his father. Rousseau would always see militias as the embodiment of popular spirit in opposition to the armies of the rulers, whom he saw as disgraceful mercenaries.[14][16][17]/nWhen Rousseau was ten, his father, an avid hunter, got into a legal quarrel with a wealthy landowner on whose lands he had been caught trespassing. To avoid certain defeat in the courts, he moved away to Nyon in the territory of Bern, taking Rousseau's aunt Suzanne with him. He remarried, and from that point Jean-Jacques saw little of him. Jean-Jacques was left with his maternal uncle, who packed him, along with his own son, Abraham Bernard, away to board for two years with a Calvinist minister in a hamlet outside Geneva. Here, the boys picked up the elements of mathematics and drawing. Rousseau, who was always deeply moved by religious services, for a time even dreamed of becoming a Protestant minister./nVirtually all our information about Rousseau's youth has come from his posthumously published Confessions, in which the chronology is somewhat confused, though recent scholars have combed the archives for confirming evidence to fill in the blanks. At age 13, Rousseau was apprenticed first to a notary and then to an engraver who beat him. At 15, he ran away from Geneva (on 14 March 1728) after returning to the city and finding the city gates locked due to the curfew./nIn adjoining Savoy he took shelter with a Roman Catholic priest, who introduced him to Fran\u00e7oise-Louise de Warens, age 29. She was a noblewoman of Protestant background who was separated from her husband. As professional lay proselytizer, she was paid by the King of Piedmont to help bring Protestants to Catholicism. They sent the boy to Turin, the capital of Savoy (which included Piedmont, in what is now Italy), to complete his conversion. This resulted in his having to give up his Genevan citizenship, although he would later revert to Calvinism to regain it./nIn converting to Catholicism, both de Warens and Rousseau were likely reacting to Calvinism's insistence on the total depravity of man. Leo Damrosch writes: \"An eighteenth-century Genevan liturgy still required believers to declare 'that we are miserable sinners, born in corruption, inclined to evil, incapable by ourselves of doing good'\".[18] De Warens, a deist by inclination, was attracted to Catholicism's doctrine of forgiveness of sins./nFinding himself on his own, since his father and uncle had more or less disowned him, the teenage Rousseau supported himself for a time as a servant, secretary, and tutor, wandering in Italy (Piedmont and Savoy) and France. During this time, he lived on and off with de Warens, whom he idolized and called his maman. Flattered by his devotion, de Warens tried to get him started in a profession, and arranged formal music lessons for him. At one point, he briefly attended a seminary with the idea of becoming a priest./nWhen Rousseau reached 20, de Warens took him as her lover, while intimate also with the steward of her house. The sexual aspect of their relationship (a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois) confused Rousseau and made him uncomfortable, but he always considered de Warens the greatest love of his life. A rather profligate spender, she had a large library and loved to entertain and listen to music. She and her circle, comprising educated members of the Catholic clergy, introduced Rousseau to the world of letters and ideas. Rousseau had been an indifferent student, but during his 20s, which were marked by long bouts of hypochondria, he applied himself in earnest to the study of philosophy, mathematics, and music. At 25, he came into a small inheritance from his mother and used a portion of it to repay de Warens for her financial support of him. At 27, he took a job as a tutor in Lyon./nIn 1742, Rousseau moved to Paris to present the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences with a new system of numbered musical notation he believed would make his fortune. His system, intended to be compatible with typography, is based on a single line, displaying numbers representing intervals between notes and dots and commas indicating rhythmic values. Believing the system was impractical, the Academy rejected it, though they praised his mastery of the subject, and urged him to try again. He befriended Denis Diderot that year, connecting over the discussion of literary endeavors.[19]/nFrom 1743 to 1744, Rousseau had an honorable but ill-paying post as a secretary to the Comte de Montaigue, the French ambassador to Venice. This awoke in him a lifelong love for Italian music, particularly opera:/nI had brought with me from Paris the prejudice of that city against Italian music; but I had also received from nature a sensibility and niceness of distinction which prejudice cannot withstand. I soon contracted that passion for Italian music with which it inspires all those who are capable of feeling its excellence. In listening to barcaroles, I found I had not yet known what singing was.../nRousseau's employer routinely received his stipend as much as a year late and paid his staff irregularly.[21] After 11 months, Rousseau quit, taking from the experience a profound distrust of government bureaucracy./nReturning to Paris, the penniless Rousseau befriended and became the lover of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Levasseur, a seamstress who was the sole support of her mother and numerous ne'er-do-well siblings. At first, they did not live together, though later Rousseau took Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and her mother in to live with him as his servants, and himself assumed the burden of supporting her large family. According to his Confessions, before she moved in with him, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se bore him a son and as many as four other children (there is no independent verification for this number).[note 2]/nRousseau wrote that he persuaded Th\u00e9r\u00e8se to give each of the newborns up to a foundling hospital, for the sake of her \"honor\". \"Her mother, who feared the inconvenience of a brat, came to my aid, and she [Th\u00e9r\u00e8se] allowed herself to be overcome\" (Confessions). In his letter to Madame de Francueil in 1751, he first pretended that he was not rich enough to raise his children, but in Book IX of the Confessions he gave the true reasons of his choice: \"I trembled at the thought of intrusting them to a family ill brought up, to be still worse educated. The risk of the education of the foundling hospital was much less\"./nTen years later, Rousseau made inquiries about the fate of his son, but no record could be found. When Rousseau subsequently became celebrated as a theorist of education and child-rearing, his abandonment of his children was used by his critics, including Voltaire and Edmund Burke, as the basis for arguments ad hominem.[22]/nBeginning with some articles on music in 1749,[note 3] Rousseau contributed numerous articles to Diderot and D'Alembert's great Encyclop\u00e9die, the most famous of which was an article on political economy written in 1755./nRousseau's ideas were the result of an almost obsessive dialogue with writers of the past, filtered in many cases through conversations with Diderot. In 1749, Rousseau was paying daily visits to Diderot, who had been thrown into the fortress of Vincennes under a lettre de cachet for opinions in his \"Lettre sur les aveugles\", that hinted at materialism, a belief in atoms, and natural selection. According to science historian Conway Zirkle, Rousseau saw the concept of natural selection \"as an agent for improving the human species.\"[23]/nRousseau had read about an essay competition sponsored by the Acad\u00e9mie de Dijon to be published in the Mercure de France on the theme of whether the development of the arts and sciences had been morally beneficial. He wrote that while walking to Vincennes (about three miles from Paris), he had a revelation that the arts and sciences were responsible for the moral degeneration of mankind, who were basically good by nature. Rousseau's 1750 Discourse on the Arts and Sciences was awarded the first prize and gained him significant fame./nRousseau continued his interest in music. He wrote both the words and music of his opera Le devin du village (The Village Soothsayer), which was performed for King Louis XV in 1752. The king was so pleased by the work that he offered Rousseau a lifelong pension. To the exasperation of his friends, Rousseau turned down the great honor, bringing him notoriety as \"the man who had refused a king's pension\". He also turned down several other advantageous offers, sometimes with a brusqueness bordering on truculence that gave offense and caused him problems. The same year, the visit of a troupe of Italian musicians to Paris, and their performance of Giovanni Battista Pergolesi's La serva padrona, prompted the Querelle des Bouffons, which pitted protagonists of French music against supporters of the Italian style. Rousseau, as noted above, was an enthusiastic supporter of the Italians against Jean-Philippe Rameau and others, making an important contribution with his Letter on French Music./nOn returning to Geneva in 1754, Rousseau reconverted to Calvinism and regained his official Genevan citizenship. In 1755, Rousseau completed his second major work, the Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men (the Discourse on Inequality), which elaborated on the arguments of the Discourse on the Arts and Sciences./nHe also pursued an unconsummated romantic attachment with the 25-year-old Sophie d'Houdetot, which partly inspired his epistolary novel Julie, ou la nouvelle H\u00e9lo\u00efse (also based on memories of his idyllic youthful relationship with Mme de Warens). Sophie was the cousin and houseguest of Rousseau's patroness and landlady Madame d'\u00c9pinay, whom he treated rather high-handedly. He resented being at Mme. d'\u00c9pinay's beck and call and detested the insincere conversation and shallow atheism of the Encyclop\u00e9distes whom he met at her table. Wounded feelings gave rise to a bitter three-way quarrel between Rousseau and Madame d'\u00c9pinay; her lover, the journalist Grimm; and their mutual friend, Diderot, who took their side against Rousseau. Diderot later described Rousseau as being \"false, vain as Satan, ungrateful, cruel, hypocritical, and wicked... He sucked ideas from me, used them himself, and then affected to despise me\".[24]/nRousseau's break with the Encyclop\u00e9distes coincided with the composition of his three major works, in all of which he emphasized his fervent belief in a spiritual origin of man's soul and the universe, in contradistinction to the materialism of Diderot, La Mettrie and D'Holbach. During this period, Rousseau enjoyed the support and patronage of Charles II Fran\u00e7ois Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Montmorency-Luxembourg and the Prince de Conti, two of the richest and most powerful nobles in France. These men truly liked Rousseau and enjoyed his ability to converse on any subject, but they also used him as a way of getting back at Louis XV and the political faction surrounding his mistress, Madame de Pompadour. Even with them, however, Rousseau went too far, courting rejection when he criticized the practice of tax farming, in which some of them engaged.[25]/nRousseau's 800-page novel of sentiment, Julie, ou la nouvelle H\u00e9lo\u00efse, was published in 1761 to immense success. The book's rhapsodic descriptions of the natural beauty of the Swiss countryside struck a chord in the public and may have helped spark the subsequent nineteenth-century craze for Alpine scenery. In 1762, Rousseau published Du Contrat Social, Principes du droit politique (in English, literally Of the Social Contract, Principles of Political Right) in April. Even his friend Antoine-Jacques Roustan felt impelled to write a polite rebuttal of the chapter on Civil Religion in the Social Contract, which implied that the concept of a Christian republic was paradoxical since Christianity taught submission rather than participation in public affairs. Rousseau helped Roustan find a publisher for the rebuttal.[26]/nRousseau published Emile, or On Education in May. A famous section of Emile, \"The Profession of Faith of a Savoyard Vicar\", was intended to be a defense of religious belief. Rousseau's choice of a Catholic vicar of humble peasant background (plausibly based on a kindly prelate he had met as a teenager) as a spokesman for the defense of religion was in itself a daring innovation for the time. The vicar's creed was that of Socinianism (or Unitarianism as it is called today). Because it rejected original sin and divine revelation, both Protestant and Catholic authorities took offense.[note 4]/nMoreover, Rousseau advocated the opinion that, insofar as they lead people to virtue, all religions are equally worthy, and that people should therefore conform to the religion in which they have been brought up. This religious indifferentism caused Rousseau and his books to be banned from France and Geneva. He was condemned from the pulpit by the Archbishop of Paris, his books were burned and warrants were issued for his arrest.[27] Former friends such as Jacob Vernes of Geneva could not accept his views and wrote violent rebuttals.[28]/nA sympathetic observer, David Hume \"professed no surprise when he learned that Rousseau's books were banned in Geneva and elsewhere\". Rousseau, he wrote, \"has not had the precaution to throw any veil over his sentiments; and, as he scorns to dissemble his contempt for established opinions, he could not wonder that all the zealots were in arms against him. The liberty of the press is not so secured in any country... as not to render such an open attack on popular prejudice somewhat dangerous.\"[29]/nAfter Rousseau's Emile had outraged the French parliament, an arrest order was issued by parliament against him, causing him to flee to Switzerland. Subsequently, when the Swiss authorities also proved unsympathetic to him\u2014condemning both Emile, and also The Social Contract\u2014Voltaire issued an invitation to Rousseau to come and reside with him, commenting that: \"I shall always love the author of the 'Vicaire savoyard' whatever he has done, and whatever he may do...Let him come here [to Ferney]! He must come! I shall receive him with open arms. He shall be master here more than I. I shall treat him like my own son.\"[30]/nRousseau later expressed regret that he had not replied to Voltaire's invitation. In July 1762, after Rousseau was informed that he could not continue to reside in Bern, D'Alembert advised him to move to the Principality of Neuch\u00e2tel, ruled by Frederick the Great of Prussia. Subsequently, Rousseau accepted an invitation to reside in M\u00f4tiers, fifteen miles from Neuch\u00e2tel. On 11 July 1762, Rousseau wrote to Frederick, describing how he had been driven from France, from Geneva, and from Bern; and seeking Frederick's protection. He also mentioned that he had criticized Frederick in the past and would continue to be critical of Frederick in the future, stating however: \"Your Majesty may dispose of me as you like.\" Frederick, still in the middle of the Seven Years' War, then wrote to the local governor of Neuch\u00e2tel, Marischal Keith, who was a mutual friend of theirs:/nWe must succor this poor unfortunate. His only offense is to have strange opinions which he thinks are good ones. I will send a hundred crowns, from which you will be kind enough to give him as much as he needs. I think he will accept them in kind more readily than in cash. If we were not at war, if we were not ruined, I would build him a hermitage with a garden, where he could live as I believe our first fathers did...I think poor Rousseau has missed his vocation; he was obviously born to be a famous anchorite, a desert father, celebrated for his austerities and flagellations...I conclude that the morals of your savage are as pure as his mind is illogical.[31]/nRousseau, touched by the help he received from Frederick, stated that from then onwards he took a keen interest in Frederick's activities. As the Seven Years' War was about to end, Rousseau wrote to Frederick again, thanking him for the help received and urging him to put an end to military activities and to endeavor to keep his subjects happy instead. Frederick made no known reply but commented to Keith that Rousseau had given him a \"scolding\".[32]/nFor more than two years (1762\u20131765) Rousseau lived at M\u00f4tiers, spending his time in reading and writing and meeting visitors such as James Boswell (December 1764). In the meantime, the local ministers had become aware of the apostasies in some of his writings and resolved not to let him stay in the vicinity. The Neuch\u00e2tel Consistory summoned Rousseau to answer a charge of blasphemy. He wrote back asking to be excused due to his inability to sit for a long time due to his ailment.[33] Subsequently, Rousseau's own pastor, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric-Guillaume de Montmollin,[34] started denouncing him publicly as an Antichrist.[35] In one inflammatory sermon, Montmollin quoted Proverbs 15:8: \"The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord, but the prayer of the upright is his delight\"; this was interpreted by everyone to mean that Rousseau's taking communion was detested by the Lord.[36] The ecclesiastical attacks inflamed the parishioners, who proceeded to pelt Rousseau with stones when he would go out for walks. Around midnight of 6\u20137 September 1765, stones were thrown at the house Rousseau was staying in, and some glass windows were shattered. When a local official, Martinet, arrived at Rousseau's residence he saw so many stones on the balcony that he exclaimed \"My God, it's a quarry!\"[37] At this point, Rousseau's friends in M\u00f4tiers advised him to leave the town./nSince he wanted to remain in Switzerland, Rousseau decided to accept an offer to move to a tiny island, the \u00cele de St.-Pierre, having a solitary house. Although it was within the Canton of Bern, from where he had been expelled two years previously, he was informally assured that he could move into this island house without fear of arrest, and he did so (10 September 1765). Here, despite the remoteness of his retreat, visitors sought him out as a celebrity.[38] However, on 17 October 1765, the Senate of Bern ordered Rousseau to leave the island and all Bernese territory within fifteen days. He replied, requesting permission to extend his stay, and offered to be incarcerated in any place within their jurisdiction with only a few books in his possession and permission to walk occasionally in a garden while living at his own expense. The Senate's response was to direct Rousseau to leave the island, and all Bernese territory, within twenty-four hours. On 29 October 1765 he left the \u00cele de St.-Pierre and moved to Strasbourg. At this point he received invitations from several parties in Europe, and soon decided to accept Hume's invitation to go to England.[39]/nOn 9 December 1765, having secured a passport from the French government, Rousseau left Strasbourg for Paris where he arrived a week later and lodged in a palace of his friend, the Prince of Conti. Here he met Hume, and also numerous friends and well-wishers, and became a conspicuous figure in the city.[40] At this time, Hume wrote: \"It is impossible to express or imagine the enthusiasm of this nation in Rousseau's favor...No person ever so much enjoyed their attention...Voltaire and everybody else are quite eclipsed.[41]/nAlthough Diderot at this time desired a reconciliation with Rousseau, both of them expected an initiative by the other, and the two did not meet.[42]/nOn 1 January 1766, Grimm included in his \"Correspondance litt\u00e9raire\" a letter said to have been written by Frederick the Great to Rousseau. It had actually been composed by Horace Walpole as a playful hoax.[note 5] Walpole had never met Rousseau, but he was well acquainted with Diderot and Grimm. The letter soon found wide publicity;[44] Hume is believed to have been present, and to have participated in its creation.[45] On 16 February 1766, Hume wrote to the Marquise de Brabantane: \"The only pleasantry I permitted myself in connection with the pretended letter of the King of Prussia was made by me at the dinner table of Lord Ossory.\" This letter was one of the reasons for the later rupture in Hume's relations with Rousseau.[44]/nOn 4 January 1766 Rousseau left Paris with Hume, the merchant De Luze (an old friend of Rousseau), and Rousseau's pet dog Sultan. After a four-day journey to Calais, where they stayed for two nights, the travelers embarked on a ship to Dover. On 13 January 1766 they arrived in London.[46] Soon after their arrival, David Garrick arranged a box at the Drury Lane Theatre for Hume and Rousseau on a night when the King and Queen also attended. Garrick was himself performing in a comedy by himself, and also in a tragedy by Voltaire.[47] Rousseau became so excited during the performance that he leaned too far and almost fell out of the box; Hume observed that the King and Queen were looking at Rousseau more than at the performance.[44] Afterwards, Garrick served supper for Rousseau, who commended Garrick's acting: \"Sir, you have made me shed tears at your tragedy, and smile at your comedy, though I scarce understood a word of your language.\"[48]/nAt this time, Hume had a favorable opinion of Rousseau; in a letter to Madame de Brabantane, Hume wrote that after observing Rousseau carefully he had concluded that he had never met a more affable and virtuous person. According to Hume, Rousseau was \"gentle, modest, affectionate, disinterested, of extreme sensitivity\". Initially, Hume lodged Rousseau in the house of Madam Adams in London, but Rousseau began receiving so many visitors that he soon wanted to move to a quieter location. An offer came to lodge him in a Welsh monastery, and he was inclined to accept it, but Hume persuaded him to move to Chiswick.[49] Rousseau now asked for Th\u00e9r\u00e8se to rejoin him.[50]/nMeanwhile, James Boswell, then in Paris, offered to escort Th\u00e9r\u00e8se to Rousseau.[51] (Boswell had earlier met Rousseau and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se at Motiers; he had subsequently also sent Th\u00e9r\u00e8se a garnet necklace and had written to Rousseau seeking permission to communicate occasionally with her.) Hume foresaw what was going to happen: \"I dread some event fatal to our friend's honor.\" Boswell and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se were together for more than a week, and as per notes in Boswell's diary they consummated the relationship, having intercourse several times. On one occasion, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se told Boswell: \"Don't imagine you are a better lover than Rousseau.\"[51]/nSince Rousseau was keen to relocate to a more remote location, Richard Davenport\u2014a wealthy and elderly widower who spoke French\u2014offered to accommodate Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Rousseau at Wootton Hall in Staffordshire. On 22 March 1766 Rousseau and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se set forth for Wootton, against Hume's advice. Hume and Rousseau would never meet again. Initially Rousseau liked his new accommodation at Wootton Hall and wrote favorably about the natural beauty of the place, and how he was feeling reborn, forgetting past sorrows.[52]/nOn 3 April 1766 a daily newspaper published the letter constituting Horace Walpole's hoax on Rousseau\u2014without mentioning Walpole as the actual author; that the editor of the publication was Hume's personal friend compounded Rousseau's grief. Gradually articles critical of Rousseau started appearing in the British press; Rousseau felt that Hume, as his host, ought to have defended him. Moreover, in Rousseau's estimate, some of the public criticism contained details to which only Hume was privy. Further, Rousseau was aggrieved to find that Hume had been lodging in London with Fran\u00e7ois Tronchin, son of Rousseau's enemy in Geneva.[53]/nAbout this time, Voltaire anonymously (as always) published his Letter to Dr. J.-J. Pansophe in which he gave extracts from many of Rousseau's prior statements which were critical of life in England; the most damaging portions of Voltaire's writeup were reprinted in a London periodical. Rousseau now decided that there was a conspiracy afoot to defame him.[54] A further cause for Rousseau's displeasure was his concern that Hume might be tampering with his mail.[55] The misunderstanding had arisen because Rousseau tired of receiving voluminous correspondence whose postage he had to pay.[note 6] Hume offered to open Rousseau's mail himself and to forward the important letters to Rousseau; this offer was accepted. However, there is some evidence of Hume intercepting even Rousseau's outgoing mail.[56]/nAfter some correspondence with Rousseau, which included an eighteen-page letter from Rousseau describing the reasons for his resentment, Hume concluded that Rousseau was losing his mental balance. On learning that Rousseau had denounced him to his Parisian friends, Hume sent a copy of Rousseau's long letter to Madame de Boufflers. She replied stating that, in her estimate, Hume's alleged participation in the composition of Horace Walpole's faux letter was the reason for Rousseau's anger.[57][note 7]/nWhen Hume learnt that Rousseau was writing the Confessions, he assumed that the present dispute would feature in the book. Adam Smith, Turgot, Marischal Keith, Horace Walpole, and Mme de Boufflers advised Hume not to make his quarrel with Rousseau public; however, many members of Holbach's coterie\u2014particularly D'Alembert\u2014urged him to reveal his version of the events. In October 1766 Hume's version of the quarrel was translated into French and published in France; in November it was published in England.[58] Grimm included it in his Correspondance litt\u00e9raire; ultimately:/n...the quarrel resounded in Geneva, Amsterdam, Berlin, and St. Petersburg. A dozen pamphlets redoubled the bruit. Walpole printed his version of the dispute; Boswell attacked Walpole; Mme. de La Tour's Precis sur M. Rousseau called Hume a traitor; Voltaire sent him additional material on Rousseau's faults and crimes, on his frequentation of \"places of ill fame\", and on his seditious activities in Switzerland. George III \"followed the battle with intense curiosity\".[59]/nAfter the dispute became public, due in part to comments from notable publishers like Andrew Millar,[60] Walpole told Hume that quarrels such as this only end up becoming a source of amusement for Europe. Diderot took a charitable view of the mess: \"I knew these two philosophers well. I could write a play about them that would make you weep, and it would excuse them both.\"[61] Amidst the controversy surrounding his quarrel with Hume, Rousseau maintained a public silence; but he resolved now to return to France. To encourage him to do so swiftly, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se advised him that the servants at Wootton Hall sought to poison him. On 22 May 1767 Rousseau and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se embarked from Dover for Calais.[59]/nOn 22 May 1767, Rousseau reentered France even though an arrest warrant against him was still in place. He had taken an assumed name, but was recognized, and a banquet in his honor was held by the city of Amiens. French nobles offered him a residence at this time. Initially, Rousseau decided to stay in an estate near Paris belonging to Mirabeau. Subsequently, on 21 June 1767, he moved to a chateau of the Prince of Conti in Trie.[62]/nAround this time, Rousseau started developing feelings of paranoia, anxiety, and of a conspiracy against him. Most of this was just his imagination at work, but on 29 January 1768, the theatre at Geneva was destroyed through burning, and Voltaire mendaciously accused Rousseau of being the culprit. In June 1768, Rousseau left Trie, leaving Th\u00e9r\u00e8se behind, and went first to Lyon, and subsequently to Bourgoin. He now invited Th\u00e9r\u00e8se to this place and married her,[note 8] under his alias \"Renou\" in a faux civil ceremony in Bourgoin on 30 August 1768.[65]/nIn January 1769, Rousseau and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se went to live in a farmhouse near Grenoble. Here he practiced botany and completed the Confessions. At this time he expressed regret for placing his children in an orphanage. On 10 April 1770, Rousseau and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se left for Lyon where he befriended Horace Coignet, a fabric designer and amateur musician. At Rousseau's suggestion, Coignet composed musical interludes for Rousseau's prose poem Pygmalion; this was performed in Lyon together with Rousseau's romance The Village Soothsayer to public acclaim. On 8 June, Rousseau and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se left Lyon for Paris; they reached Paris on 24 June.[66]/nIn Paris, Rousseau and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se lodged in an unfashionable neighborhood of the city, the Rue Platri\u00e8re\u2014now called the Rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He now supported himself financially by copying music, and continued his study of botany.[67] At this time also, he wrote his Letters on the Elements of Botany. These consisted of a series of letters Rousseau wrote to Mme Delessert in Lyon to help her daughters learn the subject. These letters received widespread acclaim when they were eventually published posthumously. \"It's a true pedagogical model, and it complements Emile,\" commented Goethe.[68]/nIn order to defend his reputation against hostile gossip, Rousseau had begun writing the Confessions in 1765. In November 1770, these were completed, and although he did not wish to publish them at this time, he began to offer group readings of certain portions of the book. Between December 1770, and May 1771, Rousseau made at least four group readings of his book with the final reading lasting seventeen hours.[69] A witness to one of these sessions, Claude Joseph Dorat, wrote:/nI expected a session of seven or eight hours; it lasted fourteen or fifteen. ... The writing is truly a phenomenon of genius, of simplicity, candor, and courage. How many giants reduced to dwarves! How many obscure but virtuous men restored to their rights and avenged against the wicked by the sole testimony of an honest man![69]/nAfter May 1771, there were no more group readings because Madame d'\u00c9pinay wrote to the chief of police, who was her friend, to put a stop to Rousseau's readings so as to safeguard her privacy. The police called on Rousseau, who agreed to stop the readings. His Confessions were finally published posthumously in 1782.[70]/nIn 1772, Rousseau was invited to present recommendations for a new constitution for the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, resulting in the Considerations on the Government of Poland, which was to be his last major political work.[71]/nAlso in 1772, Rousseau began writing Rousseau, Judge of Jean-Jacques, which was another attempt to reply to his critics. He completed writing it in 1776. The book is in the form of three dialogues between two characters; a \"Frenchman\" and \"Rousseau\", who argue about the merits and demerits of a third character\u2014an author called Jean-Jacques. It has been described as his most unreadable work; in the foreword to the book, Rousseau admits that it may be repetitious and disorderly, but he begs the reader's indulgence on the grounds that he needs to defend his reputation from slander before he dies.[72]/nIn 1766, Rousseau had impressed Hume with his physical prowess by spending ten hours at night on the deck in severe weather during the journey by ship from Calais to Dover while Hume was confined to his bunk. \"When all the seamen were almost frozen to death...he caught no harm...He is one of the most robust men I have ever known,\" Hume noted.[46] His urinary disease[73] had also been greatly alleviated after he stopped listening to the advice of doctors.[citation needed] At that time, notes Damrosch, it was often better to let nature take its own course rather than subject oneself to medical procedures. His general health had also improved.[74] However, on 24 October 1776, as he was walking on a narrow street in Paris, a nobleman's carriage came rushing by from the opposite direction; flanking the carriage was a galloping Great Dane belonging to the nobleman. Rousseau was unable to dodge both the carriage and the dog and was knocked down by the Great Dane. He seems to have suffered a concussion and neurological damage. His health began to decline; Rousseau's friend Corancez described the appearance of certain symptoms which indicate that Rousseau started suffering from epileptic seizures after the accident.[75]/nIn 1777, Rousseau received a royal visitor, when the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II came to meet him. His free entry to the Opera had been renewed by this time and he would go there occasionally.[76] At this time also (1777\u20131778), he composed one of his finest works, Reveries of a Solitary Walker, ultimately interrupted by his death.[77]/nIn the spring of 1778, the Marquis Girardin invited Rousseau to live in a cottage in his ch\u00e2teau at Ermenonville. Rousseau and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se went there on 20 May. Rousseau spent his time at the ch\u00e2teau in collecting botanical specimens, and teaching botany to Girardin's son.[78] He ordered books from Paris on grasses, mosses and mushrooms and made plans to complete his unfinished Emile and Sophie and Daphnis and Chloe.[79]/nOn 1 July, a visitor commented that \"men are wicked,\" to which Rousseau replied with \"men are wicked, yes, but man is good\"; in the evening there was a concert in the ch\u00e2teau in which Rousseau played on the piano his own composition of the Willow Song from Othello.[79] On this day also, he had a hearty meal with Girardin's family; the next morning, as he was about to go teach music to Girardin's daughter, he died of cerebral bleeding resulting in an apoplectic stroke.[80] It is now believed that repeated falls, including the accident involving the Great Dane, may have contributed to Rousseau's stroke.[81]/nFollowing his death, Grimm, Madame de Sta\u00ebl and others spread the false news that Rousseau had committed suicide; according to other gossip, Rousseau was insane when he died. All those who met him in his last days agree that he was in a serene frame of mind at this time.[82]/nOn 4 July 1778, Rousseau was buried on the \u00cele des Peupliers, a tiny, wooded island in a lake at Ermenonville,[83] which became a place of pilgrimage for his many admirers. On 11 October 1794, his remains were moved to the Panth\u00e9on, where they were placed near those of Voltaire.[82][note 9]/nRousseau later noted, that when he read the question for the essay competition of the Academy of Dijon, which he would go on to win: \"Has the rebirth of the arts and sciences contributed to the purification of the morals?\", he felt that \"the moment I read this announcement I saw another universe and became a different man\".[84] The essay he wrote in response led to one of the central themes of Rousseau's thought, which was that perceived social and cultural progress had in fact led only to the moral degradation of humanity.[85] His influences to this conclusion included Montesquieu, Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9nelon, Michel de Montaigne, Seneca the Younger, Plato, and Plutarch.[86]/nRousseau based his political philosophy on contract theory and his reading of Thomas Hobbes.[87] Reacting to the ideas of Samuel von Pufendorf and John Locke was also driving his thought.[88] All three thinkers had believed that humans living without central authority were facing uncertain conditions in a state of mutual competition.[88] In contrast, Rousseau believed that there was no explanation for why this would be the case, as there would have been no conflict or property.[89] Rousseau especially criticized Hobbes for asserting that since man in the \"state of nature... has no idea of goodness he must be naturally wicked; that he is vicious because he does not know virtue\". On the contrary, Rousseau holds that \"uncorrupted morals\" prevail in the \"state of nature\".[90]/nThe first man who, having fenced in a piece of land, said 'This is mine', and found people na\u00efve enough to believe him, that man was the true founder of civil society. From how many crimes, wars, and murders, from how many horrors and misfortunes might not any one have saved mankind, by pulling up the stakes, or filling up the ditch, and crying to his fellows: Beware of listening to this impostor; you are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us all, and the earth itself to nobody./nIn common with other philosophers of the day, Rousseau looked to a hypothetical \"state of nature\" as a normative guide. In the original condition, humans would have had \"no moral relations with or determinate obligations to one another\".[88] Because of their rare contact with each other, differences between individuals would have been of little significance.[88] Living separately, there would have been no feelings of envy or distrust, and no existence of property or conflict.[89]/nAccording to Rousseau, humans have two traits in common with other animals: the amour de soi, which describes the self-preservation instinct; and piti\u00e9, which is empathy for the rest of one's species, both of which precede reason and sociability.[91] Only humans who are morally deprived would care only about their relative status to others, leading to amour-propre, or vanity.[92] He did not believe humans to be innately superior to other species.[91] However, human beings did have the unique ability to change their nature through free choice, instead of being confined to natural instincts.[93]/nAnother aspect separating humans from other animals is the ability of perfectability, which allows humans to choose in a way that improves their condition.[94] These improvements could be lasting, leading not only to individual, but also collective change for the better.[94] Together with human freedom, the ability to improve makes possible the historic evolution of humanity.[95] However, there is no guarantee that this evolution will be for the better.[96]/nRousseau asserted that the stage of human development associated with what he called \"savages\" was the best or optimal in human development, between the less-than-optimal extreme of brute animals on the one hand and the extreme of decadent civilization on the other. \"...[N]othing is so gentle as man in his primitive state, when placed by nature at an equal distance from the stupidity of brutes and the fatal enlightenment of civil man\".[97] This has led some critics to attribute to Rousseau the invention of the idea of the noble savage,[note 10][note 11] which Arthur Lovejoy claimed misrepresents Rousseau's thought.[98][99][100]/nAccording to Rousseau, as savages had grown less dependent on nature, they had instead become dependent on each other, with society leading to the loss of freedom through the misapplication of perfectibility. When living together, humans would have gone from a nomadic lifestyle to a settled one, leading to the invention of private property. However, the resulting inequality was not a natural outcome, but rather the product of human choice.[101]/nRousseau's ideas of human development were highly interconnected with forms of mediation, or the processes that individual humans use to interact with themselves and others while using an alternate perspective or thought process. According to Rousseau, these were developed through the innate perfectibility of humanity. These include a sense of self, morality, pity, and imagination. Rousseau's writings are purposely ambiguous concerning the formation of these processes to the point that mediation is always intrinsically part of humanity's development. An example of this is the notion that an individual needs an alternative perspective to come to the realization that he or she is a 'self'.[102]/nAs long as differences in wealth and status among families were minimal, the first coming together in groups was accompanied by a fleeting golden age of human flourishing. The development of agriculture, metallurgy, private property, and the division of labour and resulting dependency on one another, however, led to economic inequality and conflict. As population pressures forced them to associate more and more closely, they underwent a psychological transformation: they began to see themselves through the eyes of others and came to value the good opinion of others as essential to their self-esteem.[103]/nAs humans started to compare themselves with each other, they began to notice that some had qualities differentiating them from others. However, only when moral significance was attached to these qualities did they start to create esteem and envy, and thereby, social hierarchies. Rousseau noted that whereas \"the savage lives within himself, sociable man, always outside himself, can only live in the opinion of others\". This then resulted in the corruption of humankind, \"producing combinations fatal to innocence and happiness\".[104]/nFollowing the attachment of importance to human difference, they would have started forming social institutions, according to Rousseau. Metallurgy and agriculture would have subsequently increased the inequalities between those with and without property. After all land had been converted into private properties, a zero-sum game would have resulted in competition for it, leading to conflict. This would have led to the creation and perpetuation of the 'hoax' of the political system by the rich, which perpetuated their power.[105]/nAccording to Rousseau, the original forms of government to emerge: monarchy, aristocracy, democracy, were all products of the differing levels of inequality in their societies. However, they would always end up with ever worse levels of inequality, until a revolution would have overthrown it and new leaders would have emerged with further extremes of injustice.[106] Nevertheless, the human capacity for self-improvement remained.[107] As the problems of humanity were the product of political choice, they could also be improved by a better political system.[108]/nThe Social Contract outlines the basis for a legitimate political order within a framework of classical republicanism. Published in 1762, it became one of the most influential works of political philosophy in the Western tradition. It developed some of the ideas mentioned in an earlier work, the article \u00c9conomie Politique (Discourse on Political Economy), featured in Diderot's Encyclop\u00e9die. In the book, Rousseau sketched the image of a new political system for regaining human freedom.[108]/nRousseau claimed that the state of nature was a primitive condition without law or morality, which human beings left for the benefits and necessity of cooperation. As society developed, the division of labor and private property required the human race to adopt institutions of law. In the degenerate phase of society, man is prone to be in frequent competition with his fellow men while also becoming increasingly dependent on them. This double pressure threatens both his survival and his freedom./nAccording to Rousseau, by joining together into civil society through the social contract and abandoning their claims of natural right, individuals can both preserve themselves and remain free. This is because submission to the authority of the general will of the people as a whole guarantees individuals against being subordinated to the wills of others and also ensures that they obey themselves because they are, collectively, the authors of the law./nAlthough Rousseau argues that sovereignty (or the power to make the laws) should be in the hands of the people, he also makes a sharp distinction between the sovereign and the government. The government is composed of magistrates, charged with implementing and enforcing the general will. The \"sovereign\" is the rule of law, ideally decided on by direct democracy in an assembly./nRousseau opposed the idea that the people should exercise sovereignty via a representative assembly (Book III, chapter XV). He approved the form of republican government of the city-state, for which Geneva provided a model\u2014or would have done if renewed on Rousseau's principles. France could not meet Rousseau's criterion of an ideal state because it was too big. Much subsequent controversy about Rousseau's work has hinged on disagreements concerning his claims that citizens constrained to obey the general will are thereby rendered free:/nThe notion of the general will is wholly central to Rousseau's theory of political legitimacy. ... It is, however, an unfortunately obscure and controversial notion. Some commentators see it as no more than the dictatorship of the proletariat or the tyranny of the urban poor (such as may perhaps be seen in the French Revolution). Such was not Rousseau's meaning. This is clear from the Discourse on Political Economy, where Rousseau emphasizes that the general will exists to protect individuals against the mass, not to require them to be sacrificed to it. He is, of course, sharply aware that men have selfish and sectional interests which will lead them to try to oppress others. It is for this reason that loyalty to the good of all alike must be a supreme (although not exclusive) commitment by everyone, not only if a truly general will is to be heeded but also if it is to be formulated successfully in the first place.[109]/nA remarkable peculiarity of Social Contract is its logical rigor, which Rousseau had learned in his twenties from mathematics:/nRousseau develops his theory in an almost mathematical manner, deriving statements from the initial thesis that man must keep close to nature. The 'natural' state, with its original liberty and equality, is hindered by man's 'unnatural' involvement in collective activities resulting in inequality which, in turn, infringes on liberty. The purpose of this social contract, which is a kind of tacit agreement, is simply to guarantee equality and, consequently, liberty as the superior social values...\nA number of political statements, particularly about the organization of powers, are derived from the 'axioms' of equality among citizens and their subordination to the general will./nRousseau offers a wealth of economic thought in his writings, especially the Discourse on Inequality, Discourse on Political Economy, the Social Contract, as well as his constitutional projects for Corsica and Poland. Rousseau's economic theory has been criticised as sporadic and unrigorous by later economists such as Joseph Schumpeter,[111] but has been praised by historians of economic thought for its nuanced view of finance and mature thought on development.[112] Scholars generally accept that Rousseau offers a critique of modern wealth and luxury. Moreover, Rousseau's economic thought is associated with agrarianism and Autarkism. Historian Istvan Hont modifies this reading, however, by suggesting that Rousseau is both a critic and a thinker of commerce, leaving room for well-regulated commerce within a well-governed civil space.[113] Political theorists Ryan Hanley and Hansong Li further argue that as a modern legislator, Rousseau seeks not to reject, but to tame utility, self-love, and even trade, finance, and luxury to serve the health of the republic.[112][114]/nThe noblest work in education is to make a reasoning man, and we expect to train a young child by making him reason! This is beginning at the end; this is making an instrument of a result. If children understood how to reason they would not need to be educated./nRousseau's philosophy of education concerns itself not with particular techniques of imparting information and concepts, but rather with developing the pupil's character and moral sense, so that he may learn to practice self-mastery and remain virtuous even in the unnatural and imperfect society in which he will have to live. A hypothetical boy, \u00c9mile, is to be raised in the countryside, which, Rousseau believes, is a more natural and healthy environment than the city, under the guardianship of a tutor who will guide him through various learning experiences arranged by the tutor. Today we would call this the disciplinary method of \"natural consequences\". Rousseau felt that children learn right and wrong through experiencing the consequences of their acts rather than through physical punishment. The tutor will make sure that no harm results to \u00c9mile through his learning experiences./nRousseau became an early advocate of developmentally appropriate education; his description of the stages of child development mirrors his conception of the evolution of culture. He divides childhood into stages:/nRousseau recommends that the young adult learn a manual skill such as carpentry, which requires creativity and thought, will keep him out of trouble, and will supply a fallback means of making a living in the event of a change of fortune (the most illustrious aristocratic youth to have been educated this way may have been Louis XVI, whose parents had him learn the skill of locksmithing[116])./nRousseau was a believer in the moral superiority of the patriarchal family on the antique Roman model. Sophie, the young woman \u00c9mile is destined to marry, as his representative of ideal womanhood, is educated to be governed by her husband while \u00c9mile, as his representative of the ideal man, is educated to be self-governing. This is not an accidental feature of Rousseau's educational and political philosophy; it is essential to his account of the distinction between private, personal relations and the public world of political relations. The private sphere, as Rousseau imagines it, depends on the subordination of women for both it and the public political sphere (upon which it depends) to function as Rousseau imagines it could and should. Rousseau anticipated the modern idea of the bourgeois nuclear family, with the mother at home taking responsibility for the household and for childcare and early education./nFeminists, beginning in the late 18th century with Mary Wollstonecraft in 1792,[117] have criticized Rousseau for his confinement of women to the domestic sphere. Unless women were domesticated and constrained by modesty and shame, he feared[118] \"men would be tyrannized by women ... For, given the ease with which women arouse men's senses\u2014men would finally be their victims ...\"[119] Rousseau also believed that Mothers were to breastfeed their children rather than using wet-nurses.[clarification needed][120] Marmontel wrote that his wife thought, \"We must pardon him [Rousseau] something\" she used to say, \"who has taught us to be mothers.\"[clarification needed]\"[121]/nRousseau's ideas have influenced progressive \"child-centered\" education.[122] John Darling's 1994 book Child-Centered Education and its Critics portrays the history of modern educational theory as a series of footnotes to Rousseau, a development he regards as bad. The theories of educators such as Rousseau's near contemporaries Pestalozzi, Mme. de Genlis and, later, Maria Montessori and John Dewey, which have directly influenced modern educational practices, have significant points in common with those of Rousseau.[123]/nHaving converted to Roman Catholicism early in life and returned to the austere Calvinism of his native Geneva as part of his period of moral reform, Rousseau maintained a profession of that religious philosophy and of John Calvin as a modern lawgiver throughout the remainder of his life.[124] Unlike many of the more agnostic Enlightenment philosophers, Rousseau affirmed the necessity of religion. His views on religion presented in his works of philosophy, however, may strike some as discordant with the doctrines of both Catholicism and Calvinism./nRousseau's strong endorsement of religious toleration, as expounded in \u00c9mile, was interpreted as advocating indifferentism, a heresy, and led to the condemnation of the book in both Calvinist Geneva and Catholic Paris. Although he praised the Bible, he was disgusted by the Christianity of his day.[125] Rousseau's assertion in The Social Contract that true followers of Christ would not make good citizens may have been another reason for his condemnation in Geneva. He also repudiated the doctrine of original sin, which plays a large part in Calvinism. In his \"Letter to Beaumont\", Rousseau wrote, \"there is no original perversity in the human heart.\"[126]/nIn the 18th century, many deists viewed God merely as an abstract and impersonal creator of the universe, likened to a giant machine. Rousseau's deism differed from the usual kind in its emotionality. He saw the presence of God in the creation as good, and separate from the harmful influence of society. Rousseau's attribution of a spiritual value to the beauty of nature anticipates the attitudes of 19th-century Romanticism towards nature and religion. (Historians\u2014notably William Everdell, Graeme Garrard, and Darrin McMahon\u2014have additionally situated Rousseau within the Counter-Enlightenment.)[127][128] Rousseau was upset that his deism was so forcefully condemned, while those of the more atheistic philosophers were ignored. He defended himself against critics of his religious views in his \"Letter to Mgr de Beaumont, the Archbishop of Paris\", \"in which he insists that freedom of discussion in religious matters is essentially more religious than the attempt to impose belief by force.\"[129]/nRousseau was a moderately successful composer of music, who wrote seven operas as well as music in other forms, and contributed to music theory. As a composer, his music was a blend of the late Baroque style and the emergent Classical fashion, i.e. Galant, and he belongs to the same generation of transitional composers as Christoph Willibald Gluck and C.\u00a0P.\u00a0E. Bach. One of his more well-known works is the one-act opera The Village Soothsayer. It contains the duet \"Non, Colette n'est point trompeuse,\" which was later rearranged as a standalone song by Beethoven,[130] and the gavotte in scene no. 8 is the source of the tune of the folk song \"Go Tell Aunt Rhody\".[131] He also composed several noted motets, some of which were sung at the Concert Spirituel in Paris.[132] Rousseau's Aunt Suzanne was passionate about music and heavily influenced Rousseau's interest in music. In his Confessions, Rousseau claims he is \"indebted\" to her for his passion of music. Rousseau took formal instruction in music at the house of Fran\u00e7oise-Louise de Warens. She housed Rousseau on and off for about 13 years, giving him jobs and responsibilities.[133] In 1742, Rousseau developed a system of musical notation that was compatible with typography and numbered. He presented his invention to the Academie Des Sciences, but they rejected it, praising his efforts and pushing him to try again.[134] In 1743, Rousseau wrote his first opera, Les Muses galantes\u00a0[fr], which was first performed in 1745./nRousseau and Jean-Philippe Rameau argued over the superiority of Italian music over French.[134] Rousseau argued that Italian music was superior based on the principle that melody must have priority over harmony. Rameau argued that French music was superior based on the principle that harmony must have priority over melody. Rousseau's plea for melody introduced the idea that in art, the free expression of a creative person is more important than the strict adherence to traditional rules and procedures. This is known today as a characteristic of Romanticism.[135] Rousseau argued for musical freedom and changed people's attitudes towards music. His works were acknowledged by composers such as Christoph Willibald Gluck and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. After composing The Village Soothsayer in 1752, Rousseau felt he could not go on working for the theater because he was a moralist who had decided to break from worldly values./nMusical compositions/nRousseau's idea of the volont\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale (\"general will\") was not original but rather belonged to a well-established technical vocabulary of juridical and theological writings in use at the time. The phrase was used by Diderot and also by Montesquieu (and by his teacher, the Oratorian friar Nicolas Malebranche). It served to designate the common interest embodied in legal tradition, as distinct from and transcending people's private and particular interests at any particular time. It displayed a rather democratic ideology, as it declared that the citizens of a given nation should carry out whatever actions they deem necessary in their own sovereign assembly.[136]/nThe concept was also an important aspect of the more radical 17th-century republican tradition of Spinoza, from whom Rousseau differed in important respects, but not in his insistence on the importance of equality:/nWhile Rousseau's notion of the progressive moral degeneration of mankind from the moment civil society established itself diverges markedly from Spinoza's claim that human nature is always and everywhere the same ... for both philosophers the pristine equality of the state of nature is our ultimate goal and criterion ... in shaping the \"common good\", volont\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, or Spinoza's mens una, which alone can ensure stability and political salvation. Without the supreme criterion of equality, the general will would indeed be meaningless. ... When in the depths of the French Revolution the Jacobin clubs all over France regularly deployed Rousseau when demanding radical reforms. and especially anything\u2014such as land redistribution\u2014designed to enhance equality, they were at the same time, albeit unconsciously, invoking a radical tradition which reached back to the late seventeenth century.[137]/nRobespierre and Saint-Just, during the Reign of Terror, regarded themselves to be principled egalitarian republicans, obliged to do away with superfluities and corruption; in this they were inspired most prominently by Rousseau. According to Robespierre, the deficiencies in individuals were rectified by upholding the 'common good' which he conceptualized as the collective will of the people; this idea was derived from Rousseau's General Will. The revolutionaries were also inspired by Rousseau to introduce Deism as the new official civil religion of France:/nCeremonial and symbolic occurrences of the more radical phases of the Revolution invoked Rousseau and his core ideas. Thus the ceremony held at the site of the demolished Bastille, organized by the foremost artistic director of the Revolution, Jacques-Louis David, in August 1793 to mark the inauguration of the new republican constitution, an event coming shortly after the final abolition of all forms of feudal privilege, featured a cantata based on Rousseau's democratic pantheistic deism as expounded in the celebrated \"Profession de foi d'un vicaire savoyard\" in book four of \u00c9mile.[138]/nRousseau's influence on the French Revolution was noted by Edmund Burke, who critiqued Rousseau in Reflections on the Revolution in France, and this critique reverberated throughout Europe, leading Catherine the Great to ban his works.[139] This connection between Rousseau and the French Revolution (especially the Terror) persisted through the next century. As Fran\u00e7ois Furet notes that \"we can see that for the whole of the nineteenth century Rousseau was at the heart of the interpretation of the Revolution for both its admirers and its critics.\"[140]/nAccording to some scholars, Rousseau exercised minimal influence on the Founding Fathers of the United States, despite similarities between their ideas. They shared beliefs regarding the self-evidence that \"all men are created equal,\" and the conviction that citizens of a republic be educated at public expense. A parallel can be drawn between the United States Constitution's concept of the \"general welfare\" and Rousseau's concept of the \"general will\". Further commonalities exist between Jeffersonian democracy and Rousseau's praise of Switzerland and Corsica's economies of isolated and independent homesteads, and his endorsement of a well-regulated civic militia, such as a navy for Corsica,[112] and the militia of the Swiss cantons.[141]/nHowever, Will and Ariel Durant have opined that Rousseau had a definite political influence on America. According to them:/nThe first sign of [Rousseau's] political influence was in the wave of public sympathy that supported active French aid to the American Revolution. Jefferson derived the Declaration of Independence from Rousseau as well as from Locke and Montesquieu. As ambassador to France (1785\u201389) he absorbed much from both Voltaire and Rousseau...The success of the American Revolution raised the prestige of Rousseau's philosophy.[142]/nOne of Rousseau's most important American followers was textbook writer Noah Webster (1758\u20131843), who was influenced by Rousseau's ideas on pedagogy in Emile (1762). Webster structured his Speller in accord with Rousseau's ideas about the stages of a child's intellectual development.[143]/nRousseau's writings perhaps had an indirect influence on American literature through the writings of Wordsworth and Kant, whose works were important to the New England transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson, as well as on Unitarians such as theologian William Ellery Channing. The Last of the Mohicans and other American novels reflect republican and egalitarian ideals present alike in Thomas Paine and in English Romantic primitivism.[note 12][144]/nThe first to criticize Rousseau were his fellow Philosophes, above all, Voltaire. According to Jacques Barzun, Voltaire was annoyed by the first discourse and outraged by the second. Voltaire's reading of the second discourse was that Rousseau would like the reader to \"walk on all fours\" befitting a savage.[145]/nSamuel Johnson told his biographer James Boswell, \"I think him one of the worst of men; a rascal, who ought to be hunted out of society, as he has been\".[146]/nJean-Baptiste Blanchard was his leading Catholic opponent. Blanchard rejects Rousseau's negative education, in which one must wait until a child has grown to develop reason. The child would find more benefit from learning in his earliest years. He also disagreed with his ideas about female education, declaring that women are a dependent lot. So, removing them from their motherly path is unnatural, as it would lead to the unhappiness of both men and women.[147]/nHistorian Jacques Barzun states that, contrary to myth, Rousseau was no primitivist; for him:/nThe model man is the independent farmer, free of superiors and self-governing. This was cause enough for the philosophes' hatred of their former friend. Rousseau's unforgivable crime was his rejection of the graces and luxuries of civilized existence. Voltaire had sung \"The superfluous, that most necessary thing.\" For the high bourgeois standard of living Rousseau would substitute the middling peasant's. It was the country versus the city\u2014an exasperating idea for them, as was the amazing fact that every new work of Rousseau's was a huge success, whether the subject was politics, theater, education, religion, or a novel about love.[148]/nAs early as 1788, Madame de Sta\u00ebl published her Letters on the works and character of J.-J. Rousseau.[149] In 1819, in his famous speech \"On Ancient and Modern Liberty\", the political philosopher Benjamin Constant, a proponent of constitutional monarchy and representative democracy, criticized Rousseau, or rather his more radical followers (specifically the Abb\u00e9 de Mably),[150] for allegedly believing that \"everything should give way to collective will, and that all restrictions on individual rights would be amply compensated by participation in social power.\"[151]/nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat severely criticized Rousseau in several of his works, most notably in \"The Law\", in which, after analyzing Rousseau's own passages, he stated that:/nAnd what part do persons play in all this? They are merely the machine that is set in motion. In fact, are they not merely considered to be the raw material of which the machine is made? Thus the same relationship exists between the legislator and the prince as exists between the agricultural expert and the farmer; and the relationship between the prince and his subjects is the same as that between the farmer and his land. How high above mankind, then, has this writer on public affairs been placed?[152]/nBastiat believed that Rousseau wished to ignore forms of social order created by the people\u2014viewing them as a thoughtless mass to be shaped by philosophers. Bastiat, who is considered by thinkers associated with the Austrian School of Economics to be one of the precursors of the \"spontaneous order\",[153] presented his own vision of what he considered to be the \"Natural Order\" in a simple economic chain in which multiple parties might interact without necessarily even knowing each other, cooperating and fulfilling each other's needs in accordance with basic economic laws such as supply and demand. In such a chain, to produce clothing, multiple parties have to act independently\u2014e.g., farmers to fertilize and cultivate land to produce fodder for the sheep, people to shear them, transport the wool, turn it into cloth, and another to tailor and sell it. Those persons engage in economic exchange by nature, and don't need to be ordered to, nor do their efforts need to be centrally coordinated. Such chains are present in every branch of human activity, in which individuals produce or exchange goods and services, and together, naturally create a complex social order that does not require external inspiration, central coordination of efforts, or bureaucratic control to benefit society as a whole./nBastiat also believed that Rousseau contradicted himself when presenting his views concerning human nature; if nature is \"sufficiently invincible to regain its empire\", why then would it need philosophers to direct it back to a natural state? Another point of criticism Bastiat raised was that living purely in nature would doom mankind to suffer unnecessary hardships.[154]/nThe Marquis de Sade's Justine, or the Misfortunes of Virtue (1791) partially parodied and used as inspiration Rousseau's sociological and political concepts in the Discourse on Inequality and The Social Contract. Concepts such as the state of nature, civilization being the catalyst for corruption and evil, and humans \"signing\" a contract to mutually give up freedoms for the protection of rights, particularly referenced. The Comte de Gernande in Justine, for instance, after Th\u00e9r\u00e8se asks him how he justifies abusing and torturing women, states:/nThe necessity mutually to render one another happy cannot legitimately exist save between two persons equally furnished with the capacity to do one another hurt and, consequently, between two persons of commensurate strength: such an association can never come into being unless a contract [un pacte] is immediately formed between these two persons, which obligates each to employ against each other no kind of force but what will not be injurious to either. . . [W]hat sort of a fool would the stronger have to be to subscribe to such an agreement?[155]/nEdmund Burke formed an unfavorable impression of Rousseau when the latter visited England with Hume and later drew a connection between Rousseau's egoistic philosophy and his personal vanity, saying Rousseau \"entertained no principle... but vanity. With this vice he was possessed to a degree little short of madness\".[156]/nThomas Carlyle said that Rousseau possessed \"the face of what is called a Fanatic . . . his Ideas possessed him like demons\". He continued:/nThe fault and misery of Rousseau was what we easily name by a single word, Egoism . . . He had not perfected himself into victory over mere Desire; a mean Hunger, in many sorts, was still the motive principle of him. I am afraid he was a very vain man; hungry for the praises of men. . . . His Books, like himself, are what I call unhealthy; not the good sort of Books. There is a sensuality in Rousseau. Combined with such an intellectual gift as his, it makes pictures of a certain gorgeous attractiveness: but they are not genuinely poetical. Not white sunlight: something operatic; a kind of rose-pink, artificial bedizenment.[157]/nCharles Dudley Warner wrote about Rousseau in his essay, Equality; \"Rousseau borrowed from Hobbes as well as from Locke in his conception of popular sovereignty; but this was not his only lack of originality. His discourse on primitive society, his unscientific and unhistoric notions about the original condition of man, were those common in the middle of the eighteenth century.\"[158]/nIn 1919, Irving Babbitt, founder of a movement called the \"New Humanism\", wrote a critique of what he called \"sentimental humanitarianism\", for which he blamed Rousseau.[100] Babbitt's depiction of Rousseau was countered in a celebrated and much reprinted essay by A.O. Lovejoy in 1923.[159][page\u00a0needed] In France, conservative theorist Charles Maurras, founder of Action Fran\u00e7aise, \"had no compunctions in laying the blame for both Romantisme et R\u00e9volution firmly on Rousseau in 1922.\"[160]/nDuring the Cold War, Rousseau was criticized for his association with nationalism and its attendant abuses, for example in Jacob Leib Talmon (1952), The Origins of Totalitarian Democracy.[note 13] This came to be known among scholars as the \"totalitarian thesis\". Political scientist J.S. Maloy states that \"the twentieth century added Nazism and Stalinism to Jacobinism on the list of horrors for which Rousseau could be blamed. ... Rousseau was considered to have advocated just the sort of invasive tampering with human nature which the totalitarian regimes of mid-century had tried to instantiate.\" But he adds that \"The totalitarian thesis in Rousseau studies has, by now, been discredited as an attribution of real historical influence.\"[161] Arthur Melzer, however, while conceding that Rousseau would not have approved of modern nationalism, observes that his theories do contain the \"seeds of nationalism\", insofar as they set forth the \"politics of identification\", which are rooted in sympathetic emotion. Melzer also believes that in admitting that people's talents are unequal, Rousseau therefore tacitly condones the tyranny of the few over the many.[162] For Stephen T. Engel, on the other hand, Rousseau's nationalism anticipated modern theories of \"imagined communities\" that transcend social and religious divisions within states.[163]/nOn similar grounds, one of Rousseau's strongest critics during the second half of the 20th century was political philosopher Hannah Arendt. Using Rousseau's thought as an example, Arendt identified the notion of sovereignty with that of the general will. According to her, it was this desire to establish a single, unified will based on the stifling of opinion in favor of public passion that contributed to the excesses of the French Revolution.[164]/nThe book Rousseau and Revolution, by Will and Ariel Durant, begins with the following words about Rousseau:/nHow did it come about that a man born poor, losing his mother at birth and soon deserted by his father, afflicted with a painful and humiliating disease, left to wander for twelve years among alien cities and conflicting faiths, repudiated by society and civilization, repudiating Voltaire, Diderot, the Encyclop\u00e9die and the Age of Reason, driven from place to place as a dangerous rebel, suspected of crime and insanity, and seeing, in his last months, the apotheosis of his greatest enemy\u2014how did it come about that this man, after his death, triumphed over Voltaire, revived religion, transformed education, elevated the morals of France, inspired the Romantic movement and the French Revolution, influenced the philosophy of Kant and Schopenhauer, the plays of Schiller, the novels of Goethe, the poems of Wordsworth, Byron and Shelley, the socialism of Marx, the ethics of Tolstoy and, altogether, had more effect upon posterity than any other writer or thinker of that eighteenth century in which writers were more influential than they had ever been before?[165]/nThe German writers Goethe, Schiller, and Herder have stated that Rousseau's writings inspired them. Herder regarded Rousseau to be his \"guide\", and Schiller compared Rousseau to Socrates. Goethe, in 1787, stated: \"Emile and its sentiments had a universal influence on the cultivated mind.\"[166] The elegance of Rousseau's writing is held to have inspired a significant transformation in French poetry and drama\u2014freeing them from rigid literary norms./nOther writers who were influenced by Rousseau's writings included Leopardi in Italy; Pushkin and Tolstoy in Russia; Wordsworth, Southey, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, Keats, and Blake in England; and Hawthorne and Thoreau in America. According to Tolstoy: \"At sixteen I carried around my neck, instead of the usual cross, a medallion with Rousseau's portrait.\"[167]/nRousseau's Discourse on the Arts and Sciences, emphasizing individualism and repudiating \"civilization\", was appreciated by, among others, Thomas Paine, William Godwin, Shelley, Tolstoy, and Edward Carpenter.[167] Rousseau's contemporary Voltaire appreciated the section in Emile titled Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar.[168][31]/nDespite his criticisms, Carlyle admired Rousseau's sincerity: \"with all his drawbacks, and they are many, he has the first and chief characteristic of a Hero: he is heartily in earnest. In earnest, if ever man was; as none of these French Philosophers were.\" He also admired his repudiation of atheism:/nStrangely through all that defacement, degradation and almost madness, there is in the inmost heart of poor Rousseau a spark of real heavenly fire. Once more, out of the element of that withered mocking Philosophism, Scepticism and Persiflage, there has arisen in this man the ineradicable feeling and knowledge that this Life of ours is true: not a Scepticism, Theorem, or Persiflage, but a Fact, an awful Reality. Nature had made that revelation to him; had ordered him to speak it out. He got it spoken out; if not well and clearly, then ill and dimly,\u2014as clearly as he could.[157]/nModern admirers of Rousseau include John Dewey and Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss.[169] According to Matthew Josephson, Rousseau has remained controversial for more than two centuries, and has continued to gain admirers and critics down to the present time. However, in their own way, both critics and admirers have served to underscore the significance of the man, while those who have evaluated him with fairness have agreed that he was the finest thinker of his time on the question of civilization.[169][note 14]/nCategory", "60472907": "Karissa Y.

Sanbonmatsu studied physics at Columbia University, where she used the Very Large Array radio telescope to estimate the distance to supernova remnant G27.4+0.0 and its central X-ray source,[2] which is now known to be a magnetar.[3][4] Karissa's early research was in plasma physics. She earned her PhD in astrophysical sciences at University of Colorado Boulder under Martin V. Goldman (a student of Donald F. Dubois). Her dissertation entailed analytical treatments of non-linear wave-wave interactions in plasmas, elucidating the competition between Langmuir wave-wave and wave-particle effects in the auroral ionosphere.[5][6][7]  In 1997, after earning her doctorate, Sanbonmatsu joined Los Alamos National Laboratory as a postdoctoral scholar[4][8] under Donald F. Dubois (a student of Murray Gell-Mann), determining the effect of kinetic processes on Langmuir waves in plasmas.[9][10] She became interested in what distinguishes life from matter.[11] In 2002 Los Alamos built Q-machine, one of the world's fastest supercomputer.[11] The Q-machine allowed Sanbonmatsu to run the world's largest simulation in biology, publishing the first simulation of the ribosome in 2005, where she identified the \u201caccommodation corridor\u201d of the ribosome.[11][12]/nThe Sanbonmatsu Laboratory at Los Alamos National Laboratory was established in 2001.[4] They use a variety of wet lab and computational techniques to study ribosomes, long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs), riboswitches[13][14] and chromatin. In 2005, Sanbonmatsu was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers.[15] At the time, epigenetics was beginning to develop, and Sanbonmatsu realised that RNA could be involved in how genes are turned on and off.[11]/nBeginning in 2009, the Sanbonmatsu lab began releasing the Phenix/cryo_fit family of software in collaboration with many others. Built around the concept of native contact potential, it allows protein sequences to be fit to the 3D protein shape density determined by Cryo-Electron Microscopy. As cryo-EM overtook X-ray crystallography as the most widely used method for determining protein structure, the lab published 20 articles in 10 years implementing different software versions, many cited hundreds of times each. The software was used to determine the structure of Coronavirus spike protein and it's interaction with human ACE-2 to cause infection.[3]/nSanbonmatsu has also been a leading figure in structural studies of long non-coding RNAs in epigenetics. She studied COOLAIR, a stretch of RNA that controls the timing and flowering of plants.[16] It works by controlling the internal triggers that tell a plant to stop flowering, which work in combination with a repressor protein called Flowering Locus C.[16]  When Sanbonmatsu studied the RNA structure, she found features that are similar to ribosomes.[16] In 2012 her group was the first to describe the secondary structure in a lncRNA; the steroid hormone receptor activator (SRA).[17] She went on to look at how the structure of RNA impacted the fate of a cell.[18] She uses illumina dye sequencing for high throughput SHAPE probing.[19]/nShe develops computer simulations to understand tRNA translocation, combining single molecule fluorescence with cryogenic electron microscopy. Ribosomes undergo a dramatic change in structure when transfer RNA are passing through, and this was simulated computationally by Sanbonmatsu.[19] Sanbonmatsu has also written about gynandromorphism, and how DNA influences hormones, but hormone can reprogram DNA.[20] She was elected as a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2012.[19] Most recently, her group set the record for the world's largest published biomolecular simulation at one billion atoms, the first simulation of an entire gene./nShe described her work with epigenetics and came out as transgender in a 2014 TEDxTalk.[21] Sanbonmatsu delivered a TED talk at TEDWomen on The biology of gender, from DNA to the brain, in November 2018.[22] In the talk she covered epigenetics, how DNA can change due to trauma and diet, and how her gender transition led her to study the role of epigenetics in gender identity.

Through his study of features in the landscape and coastlines of his native Scottish lowlands, such as Salisbury Crags or Siccar Point, he developed the theory that geological features could not be static but underwent continuing transformation over indefinitely long periods of time. From this he argued, in agreement with many other early geologists, that the Earth could not be young. He was one of the earliest proponents of what in the 1830s became known as uniformitarianism, the science which explains features of the Earth's crust as the outcome of continuing natural processes over the long geologic time scale. Hutton also put forward a thesis for a 'system of the habitable Earth' proposed as a deistic mechanism designed to keep the world eternally suitable for humans,[4] an early attempt to formulate what today might be called one kind of anthropic principle./nSome reflections similar to those of Hutton can be found in publications of his contemporaries, such as the French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon,[4] but it is chiefly Hutton's pioneering work that established the field.[5][6]/nHutton was born in Edinburgh on 3 June O.S.[7] 1726, as one of five children of Sarah Balfour and William Hutton, a merchant who was Edinburgh City Treasurer. Hutton's father died in 1729, when he was three./nHe was educated at the High School of Edinburgh where he was particularly interested in mathematics and chemistry, then when he was 14 he attended the University of Edinburgh as a \"student of humanity\", studying the classics. He was apprenticed to the lawyer George Chalmers WS when he was 17, but took more interest in chemical experiments than legal work. At the age of 18, he became a physician's assistant, and attended lectures in medicine at the University of Edinburgh./nAfter a two-year stay in Paris, James Hutton arrived in Leiden in 1749, where he enrolled at the University of Leiden on 14 August 1749, at the home of the then rector magnificus Joachim Schwartz to obtain a doctorate in medicine. He stayed with the widow Van der Tas (n\u00e9e Judith Bouvat) at the Langebrug, which corresponds to the current address Langebrug 101 in Leiden. His supervisor was Professor Frederik Winter, who was not only a professor at Leiden University, but also court physician to the Stadholder. The Latin manuscript of Hutton's dissertation also contained 92 theses, two of which were successfully defended in public by James Hutton on 3 September 1749. On 12 September 1749, James Hutton obtained his doctorate in medicine from Leiden University with a physico-medical thesis entitled Sanguine et Circulatione Microcosmi. The thesis was printed by Wilhelmus Boot, book printer in Leiden. It is believed that James Hutton returned to Britain shortly after his promotion.[8][9]:\u200a2/nAfter his degree Hutton went to London, then in mid-1750 returned to Edinburgh and resumed chemical experiments with close friend, James Davie. Their work on production of sal ammoniac from soot led to their partnership in a profitable chemical works,[9]:\u200a2\u200a manufacturing the crystalline salt which was used for dyeing, metalworking and as smelling salts and had been available only from natural sources and had to be imported from Egypt. Hutton owned and rented out properties in Edinburgh, employing a factor to manage this business.[10]/nHutton inherited from his father the Berwickshire farms of Slighhouses, a lowland farm which had been in the family since 1713, and the hill farm of Nether Monynut.[9]:\u200a2\u20133\u200a In the early 1750s he moved to Slighhouses and set about making improvements, introducing farming practices from other parts of Britain and experimenting with plant and animal husbandry.[9]:\u200a2\u20133\u200a He recorded his ideas and innovations in an unpublished treatise on The Elements of Agriculture.[9]:\u200a60/nThis developed his interest in meteorology and geology. In a 1753 letter he wrote that he had \"become very fond of studying the surface of the earth, and was looking with anxious curiosity into every pit or ditch or bed of a river that fell in his way\". Clearing and draining his farm provided ample opportunities. The mathematician John Playfair described Hutton as having noticed that \"a vast proportion of the present rocks are composed of materials afforded by the destruction of bodies, animal, vegetable and mineral, of more ancient formation\". His theoretical ideas began to come together in 1760. While his farming activities continued, in 1764 he went on a geological tour of the north of Scotland with George Maxwell-Clerk,[11] ancestor of the famous James Clerk Maxwell.[12]/nIn 1768, Hutton returned to Edinburgh, letting his farms to tenants but continuing to take an interest in farm improvements and research which included experiments carried out at Slighhouses. He developed a red dye made from the roots of the madder plant.[13]/nHe had a house built in 1770 at St John's Hill, Edinburgh, overlooking Salisbury Crags. This later became the Balfour family home and, in 1840, the birthplace of the psychiatrist James Crichton-Browne. Hutton was one of the most influential participants in the Scottish Enlightenment, and fell in with numerous first-class minds in the sciences including mathematician John Playfair, philosopher David Hume and economist Adam Smith.[14] Hutton held no position in the University of Edinburgh  and communicated his scientific findings through the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He was particularly friendly with physician and chemist Joseph Black, and together with Adam Smith they founded the Oyster Club for weekly meetings./nBetween 1767 and 1774 Hutton had close involvement with the construction of the Forth and Clyde canal, making full use of his geological knowledge, both as a shareholder and as a member of the committee of management, and attended meetings including extended site inspections of all the works. At this time he is listed as living on Bernard Street in Leith.[15] In 1777 he published a pamphlet on Considerations on the Nature, Quality and Distinctions of Coal and Culm which successfully helped to obtain relief from excise duty on carrying small coal.[16]/nIn 1783, he was a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.[17]/nFrom 1791 Hutton suffered extreme pain from stones in the bladder and gave up field work to concentrate on finishing his books. A dangerous and painful operation failed to resolve his illness.[18] He died in Edinburgh and was buried in the vault of Andrew Balfour, opposite the vault of his friend Joseph Black, in the now sealed south-west section of Greyfriars Kirkyard in Edinburgh, commonly known as the Covenanter's Prison./nHutton did not marry and had no legitimate children.[17] Around 1747, he had a son by a Miss Edington, and though he gave his child, James Smeaton Hutton, financial assistance, he had little to do with the boy, who went on to become a post-office clerk in London.[19]/nHutton developed several hypotheses to explain the rock formations he saw around him, but according to Playfair he \"was in no haste to publish his theory; for he was one of those who are much more delighted with the contemplation of truth, than with the praise of having discovered it\". After some 25 years of work,[20] his Theory of the Earth; or an Investigation of the Laws observable in the Composition, Dissolution, and Restoration of Land upon the Globe was read to meetings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in two parts, the first by his friend Joseph Black on 7 March 1785, and the second by himself on 4 April 1785. Hutton subsequently read an abstract of his dissertation Concerning the System of the Earth, its Duration and Stability to Society meeting on 4 July 1785,[21] which he had printed and circulated privately.[22] In it, he outlined his theory as follows;/nThe solid parts of the present land appear in general, to have been composed of the productions of the sea, and of other materials similar to those now found upon the shores. Hence we find reason to conclude:/n1st, That the land on which we rest is not simple and original, but that it is a composition, and had been formed by the operation of second causes.\n2nd, That before the present land was made, there had subsisted a world composed of sea and land, in which were tides and currents, with such operations at the bottom of the sea as now take place. And,/nLastly, That while the present land was forming at the bottom of the ocean, the former land maintained plants and animals; at least the sea was then inhabited by animals, in a similar manner as it is at present.\nHence we are led to conclude, that the greater part of our land, if not the whole had been produced by operations natural to this globe; but that in order to make this land a permanent body, resisting the operations of the waters, two things had been required;\n1st, The consolidation of masses formed by collections of loose or incoherent materials;/n2ndly, The elevation of those consolidated masses from the bottom of the sea, the place where they were collected, to the stations in which they now remain above the level of the ocean./nIn the summer of 1785 at Glen Tilt and other sites in the Cairngorm mountains in the Scottish Highlands, Hutton found granite penetrating metamorphic schists, in a way which indicated that the granite had been molten at the time. This was Hutton's first geological field trip and he was invited by the Duke of Atholl to his hunting lodge, Forest Lodge. The exposures at the Dail-an-eas Bridge demonstrated to him that granite formed from the cooling of molten rock rather than it precipitating out of water as others at the time believed, and therefore the granite must be younger than the schists.[23][24] Hutton presented his theory of the earth on 4 March and 7 April 1785, at the Royal Society of Edinburgh.[25]/nHe went on to find a similar penetration of volcanic rock through sedimentary rock in Edinburgh, at Salisbury Crags,[3] adjoining Arthur's Seat \u2013 this area of the Crags is now known as Hutton's Section.[26][27] He found other examples in Galloway in 1786, and on the Isle of Arran in 1787./nThe existence of angular unconformities had been noted by Nicolas Steno and by French geologists including Horace-B\u00e9n\u00e9dict de Saussure, who interpreted them in terms of Neptunism as \"primary formations\". Hutton wanted to examine such formations himself to see  \"particular marks\" of the relationship between the rock layers. On the 1787 trip to the Isle of Arran he found his first example of Hutton's Unconformity to the north of Newton Point near Lochranza,[28][29] but the limited view meant that the condition of the underlying strata was not clear enough for him,[30] and he incorrectly thought that the strata were conformable at a depth below the exposed outcrop.[31]/nLater in 1787 Hutton noted what is now known as the Hutton or \"Great\" Unconformity at Inchbonny,[5] Jedburgh, in layers of sedimentary rock.[32] As shown in the illustrations to the right, layers of greywacke in the lower layers of the cliff face are tilted almost vertically, and above an intervening layer of conglomerate lie horizontal layers of Old Red Sandstone. He later wrote of how he \"rejoiced at my good fortune in stumbling upon an object so interesting in the natural history of the earth, and which I had been long looking for in vain.\" That year, he found the same sequence in Teviotdale.[30]/nIn the Spring of 1788 he set off with John Playfair to the Berwickshire coast and found more examples of this sequence in the valleys of the Tour and Pease Burns near Cockburnspath.[30] They then took a boat trip from Dunglass Burn east along the coast with the geologist Sir James Hall of Dunglass. They found the sequence in the cliff below St. Helens, then just to the east at Siccar Point found what Hutton called \"a beautiful picture of this junction washed bare by the sea\".[33][34] Playfair later commented about the experience, \"the mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time\".[35] Continuing along the coast, they made more discoveries including sections of the vertical beds showing strong ripple marks which gave Hutton \"great satisfaction\" as a confirmation of his supposition that these beds had been laid horizontally in water. He also found conglomerate at altitudes that demonstrated the extent of erosion of the strata, and said of this that \"we never should have dreamed of meeting with what we now perceived\".[30]/nHutton reasoned that there must have been innumerable cycles, each involving deposition on the seabed, uplift with tilting and erosion then undersea again for further layers to be deposited. On the belief that this was due to the same geological forces operating in the past as the very slow geological forces seen operating at the present day, the thicknesses of exposed rock layers implied to him enormous stretches of time.[5]/nThough Hutton circulated privately a printed version of the abstract of his Theory (Concerning the System of the Earth, its Duration, and Stability) which he read at a meeting of the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 4 July 1785;[22] the full account of his theory as read at 7 March 1785 and 4 April 1785 meetings did not appear in print until 1788. It was titled Theory of the Earth; or an Investigation of the Laws observable in the Composition, Dissolution, and Restoration of Land upon the Globe and appeared in Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. I, Part II, pp.\u00a0209\u2013304, plates I and II, published 1788.[21] He put forward the view that \"from what has actually been, we have data for concluding with regard to that which is to happen thereafter.\" This restated the Scottish Enlightenment concept which David Hume had put in 1777 as \"all inferences from experience suppose\u00a0... that the future will resemble the past\", and Charles Lyell memorably rephrased in the 1830s as \"the present is the key to the past\".[36] Hutton's 1788 paper concludes; \"The result, therefore, of our present enquiry is, that we find no vestige of a beginning,\u2013no prospect of an end.\"[21] His memorably phrased closing statement has long been celebrated.[5][37] (It was quoted in the 1989 song \"No Control\" by songwriter and professor Greg Graffin.[38])/nFollowing criticism, especially the arguments from Richard Kirwan who thought Hutton's ideas were atheistic and not logical,[21] Hutton published a two volume version of his theory in 1795,[39][40] consisting of the 1788 version of his theory (with slight additions) along with a lot of material drawn from shorter papers Hutton already had to hand on various subjects such as the origin of granite.  It included a review of alternative theories, such as those of Thomas Burnet and Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon./nThe whole was entitled An Investigation of the Principles of Knowledge and of the Progress of Reason, from Sense to Science and Philosophy when the third volume was completed in 1794.[41] Its 2,138 pages prompted Playfair to remark that \"The great size of the book, and the obscurity which may justly be objected to many parts of it, have probably prevented it from being received as it deserves.\"/nHis new theories placed him into opposition with the then-popular Neptunist theories of the German geologist Abraham Gottlob Werner, that all rocks had precipitated out of a single enormous flood. Hutton proposed that the interior of the Earth was hot, and that this heat was the engine which drove the creation of new rock: land was eroded by air and water and deposited as layers in the sea; heat then consolidated the sediment into stone, and uplifted it into new lands. This theory was dubbed \"Plutonist\" in contrast to the flood-oriented theory./nAs well as combating the Neptunists, he also accepted the growing consensus on the concept of deep time for scientific purposes. Rather than accepting that the earth was no more than a few thousand years old, he maintained that the Earth must be much older, with a history extending indefinitely into the distant past.[23] His main line of argument was that the tremendous displacements and changes he was seeing did not happen in a short period of time by means of catastrophe, but that processes still happening on the Earth in the present day had caused them. As these processes were very gradual, the Earth needed to be ancient, to allow time for the changes. Contemporary investigations had shown that the geologic record required vast time, but no good way of assigning actual years was found for over a century (Rudwick, Bursting the Limits of Time).  Hutton's idea of infinite cycles with humans present throughout is quite different from modern geology, with a definite time of formation and directional change through time, but his supporting evidence for the long-term effects of geological processes was valuable in the development of historical geology./nIt has been claimed that the prose of Principles of Knowledge was so obscure that it also impeded the acceptance of Hutton's geological theories.[42]  Restatements of his geological ideas (though not his thoughts on evolution) by John Playfair in 1802 and then Charles Lyell in the 1830s popularised the concept of an infinitely repeating cycle, though Lyell tended to dismiss Hutton's views as giving too much credence to catastrophic changes./nIt was not merely the earth to which Hutton directed his attention. He had long studied the changes of the atmosphere. The same volume in which his Theory of the Earth appeared contained also a Theory of Rain. He contended that the amount of moisture which the air can retain in solution increases with temperature, and, therefore, that on the mixture of two masses of air of different temperatures a portion of the moisture must be condensed and appear in visible form. He investigated the available data regarding rainfall and climate in different regions of the globe, and came to the conclusion that the rainfall is regulated by the humidity of the air on the one hand, and mixing of different air currents in the higher atmosphere on the other./nHutton taught that biological and geological processes are interlinked.[43] James Lovelock, who developed the Gaia hypothesis in the 1970s, cites Hutton as saying that the Earth was a superorganism and that its proper study should be physiology.[44] Lovelock writes that Hutton's view of the Earth was rejected because of the intense reductionism among 19th-century scientists.[44]/nHutton also advocated uniformitarianism for living creatures \u00a0\u2013 evolution, in a sense\u00a0\u2013 and even suggested natural selection as a possible mechanism affecting them:/nHutton gave the example that where dogs survived through \"swiftness of foot and quickness of sight... the most defective in respect of those necessary qualities, would be the most subject to perish, and that those who employed them in greatest perfection... would be those who would remain, to preserve themselves, and to continue the race\". Equally, if an acute sense of smell became \"more necessary to the sustenance of the animal... the same principle [would] change the qualities of the animal, and.. produce a race of well scented hounds, instead of those who catch their prey by swiftness\". The same \"principle of variation\" would influence \"every species of plant, whether growing in a forest or a meadow\". He came to his ideas as the result of experiments in plant and animal breeding, some of which he outlined in an unpublished manuscript, the Elements of Agriculture. He distinguished between heritable variation as the result of breeding, and non-heritable variations caused by environmental differences such as soil and climate.[41]/nThough he saw his \"principle of variation\" as explaining the development of varieties, Hutton rejected the idea that evolution might originate species as a \"romantic fantasy\", according to palaeoclimatologist Paul Pearson.[45] Influenced by deism,[46] Hutton thought the mechanism allowed species to form varieties better adapted to particular conditions and provided evidence of benevolent design in nature. Studies of Charles Darwin's notebooks have shown that Darwin arrived separately at the idea of natural selection which he set out in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species, but it has been speculated that he had some half-forgotten memory from his time as a student in Edinburgh of ideas of selection in nature as set out by Hutton, and by William Charles Wells and Patrick Matthew who had both been associated with the city before publishing their ideas on the topic early in the 19th century.[41]", "64208480": "Colette Marie St. Mary is a professor and associate chair of the biology department at the University of Florida. Her research focuses include behavioral and evolutionary ecology, speciation, sexual selection, and evolutionary aspects of cancer. Working mainly with fish model organisms, St. Mary is also interested in marine fisheries management and reproduction and evolution in hatchery settings. St. Mary received her Bachelor's degree in Biology from Harvard Radcliffe College before earning her Ph.D from University of California, Santa Barbara in 1994. She is the first African-American woman to ever receive a Ph.D. in evolutionary biology in the United States.[1] Her thesis was on the determinant of sex allocation patterns and maintenance of simultaneous hermaphroditism in the blue banded goby and zebra goby.[2]/nSt. Mary's research into the evolution of parental care has caused a shift in the conceptual understanding of the evolution of prenatal care (in fishes). The previous theory proposed by evolutionary biologists is parental care comes at a tradeoff - by engaging in parental care for current offspring, males are decreasing the time and energy available for future mating events or survivorship.[3] Thus it would be expected that not males who do not provide parental care would have increased lifetime reproductive success by fertilizing eggs from more females. This would suggest that males should invest in courtship rather than parental care; however this is not what is observed. Together with colleagues, St. Mary showed that in species with male-only parental care, females evaluate males based on their level of parental care, and that males show increased care in the presence of potential mates, suggesting that male parental care is subject to sexual selection as a result of female choice.[4][5][6] More recently, studies of bi-parental care species like certain cichlid fish validated these data and showed that some parental care behaviors function to increase both survival of offspring and mating success./nSt. Mary has also collaborated on the study of the effect of agriculture (and agricultural contaminants) on gonadal form and function in the giant cane toad Bufo marinus (also known as Rhinella marina), which found that toads living on land used for agriculture had increased incidences of gonadal abnormalities and intersex gonads. Males were feminized or demasculinized with altered testosterone levels corresponding to the level of agricultural land use.[7] She also helped publish another study of the giant toad species which demonstrated reduced spermatogenesis in toads living in agricultural areas due to endocrine disrupting chemicals.[8] Other studies authored in this field include the ecological determinants of settlement choice in coral reef fish larvae,[9] and the effects of hatchery rearing of Florida largemouth bass.[10]/nSt. Mary has also contributed significantly to the field of autotomy. Though a behavior that has evolved repeatedly - seen in crabs, lizards, crickets, and more, the evolutionary pressure behind limb loss is not well understood. The loss of a limb exposes an organism to significant costs - loss of blood or body fluid, risk of infection, and the loss of that limb function, which could affect reproductive success. However, she and her colleagues have demonstrated that in some cases self-autotomy can reduce the cost of injury or allow the organism to escape predation, confirming two popular theories behind the practice.[11][12] While autotomy for escaping predators is relatively widely accepted, limb loss as a method to reduce the survival cost injury is a novel feature first demonstrated by Dr. St. Mary et al. By autotomizing at a preformed breakage plane the organism can reduce the survival cost of the injury.", "61259361": "Angela Brooks is an Assistant Professor of Biomolecular Engineering at University of California, Santa Cruz.

He is a professor emeritus at the University of Washington and a former senior fellow at Howard Hughes Medical Institution Janelia Research Campus.[1]/nTruman was introduced to biological research as an undergraduate at the University of Notre Dame in the laboratory of George B. Craig. He was intrigued by Craig's discoveries relating to the hormonal regulation of mosquito mating behavior.[1] As a graduate student, he continued to study hormonal control of insect behavior at Harvard University where he received his PhD in 1970. His doctoral advisor was Lynn Riddiford, whom he later married. He began his research in chronobiology as a junior fellow at Harvard University and continued this work when he established his own laboratory in 1973 at the University of Washington.[1]/nTruman took three sabbaticals from the University of Washington.[1] The first, in 1986, was to Cambridge University, where he studied Drosophila neurobiology under Mike Bate. In the second half of this sabbatical he then traveled to Kenya, where he spent time researching tsetse fly development. On his second sabbatical in 1993, Truman traveled to the Australian National University in Canberra, Australia, to research grasshopper metamorphosis hormones with Eldon Ball. In his final sabbatical, he returned to Cambridge University to study evolutionary developmental biology with Michael Akam./nIn 2007, after 34 years at University of Washington, Truman retired from the university in order to study insect neuronal stem cells as a group leader at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Janelia Research Campus, in Ashburn, Virginia.[1] In 2016, he retired from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and returned to the University of Washington to pursue research at Friday Harbor Laboratories. His current research focuses on the development and evolution of insect and crustacean nervous systems.[2]/nWhile still in graduate school at Harvard, Truman identified an insect neurohormone now known as the eclosion hormone, which mediates moth ecdysis.[1] He demonstrated that injecting eclosion hormone (EH) into moths elicits a stereotyped sequence of ecdysis behaviors.[3] In future studies of silkmoth eclosion, Truman went on to confirm the role of EH in mediating ecdysis. Later studies also implicated a brain-based circadian clock as the regulator controlling the release of EH./nAs a junior fellow in the Harvard Society of Fellows,[1] Truman studied the underlying mechanisms of silkmoth eclosion, mainly focusing on the role of the circadian clock in driving time of day rhythms in eclosion. Truman demonstrated that eclosion rhythms persist in Hyalophora cecropia moths that have had their compound eyes, corpora cardiaca, and corpora allata surgically removed.[4] Eclosion rhythms were only abolished with the removal of the brain, indicating that the circadian clock is located within the brain.[4] Further experiments involving brain transplantation and selective illumination of different parts of the body revealed that the circadian photoreceptors, which are responsible for receiving light information to entrain the circadian clock, are also located in the brain./nMore brain transplant experiments in Hyalophora cecropia and Antheraea pernyi showed that both entrained and free-running eclosion rhythms can be rescued in debrained moths that have had brains transplanted into their abdomens.[4] These restored eclosion rhythms in the debrained moths matched in phase angle with the eclosion rhythms observed in the donor moths prior to brain transplantation. These results confirmed Truman's previous findings that the circadian clock is located within the brain and that the factor mediating eclosion behavior is hormonal. Similar experiments focusing on the role of the circadian clock in regulating flight rhythms confirmed that extraretinal photoreceptors in the brain are responsible for entraining a brain-based circadian clock.[5]/nIn 2008, Truman went on to discover that eclosion rhythms, which are mediated by the circadian release of the neurohormone EH, can be masked.[6] In chronobiology, masking refers to the apparent coupling of an observable biological rhythm with an external environmental time cue, without affecting the underlying circadian clock that mediates the observed rhythm. Truman and colleagues observed increased eclosion in adult Drosophila flies immediately following a lights-on signal, which lead to their subsequent discovery that light triggers rapid eclosion in Drosophila on the condition that there was prior EH release. This occurs through the convergence of parallel neurosecretory pathways, both of which are activated by EH. These two EH activated pathways oppose each other; one is an excitatory behavioral pathway and one is inhibitory. Truman and colleagues found that the presence of light can result in the inhibition of the inhibitory pathway, leading to a greater net effect of the excitatory pathway. This light-mediated response promotes more rapid Drosophila eclosion and as a result masks the circadian eclosion rhythms. Further work with Drosophila resulted in the finding that masking of circadian eclosion rhythms can also occur through the inhibition of eclosion. In 2008, Truman and colleagues found that expression of the light chain of tetanus toxin (UAS-TNT) can affect the release of EH from EH releasing cells in the fly brain.[7] This inhibition of EH release results in the inhibition of eclosion\u2014pointing to another way to mask circadian eclosion in Drosophila./nSome of Truman's most influential work outside of chronobiology involves how hormones alter the nervous system to influence behavior in insect models. Notably, Truman and colleagues have studied neuronal remodeling during insect metamorphosis. Their model organism, the hornworm moth (Manduca sexta), was chosen because it has a well-studied endocrinology and its large size allows for the use of standard electrophysiological and neuroanatomical techniques.[8] In 1986, Truman found that accompanying the bodily changes of the hornworm moth was an extensive reorganization of the moth's central nervous system (CNS). Among many changes was the finding that upon onset of metamorphosis, vast cell death sweeps through nests of larvae that are at the end of larval life. These nest cells were previously in an arrested state, but after this metamorphosis-induced cell death, the surviving nest cells can then differentiate. These cells become functional adult CNS neurons./nFollowing his interest in the evolution of metamorphosis, Truman began conducting research on the evolution of the insect nervous system at the Janelia Research Campus. Working in Drosophila model systems, he corroborated his findings from his work in Manduca sexta and discovered that as the adult insect CNS develops during metamorphosis, neuronal stem cells (neuroblasts) differentiate based on specific, highly conserved lineages. He also identified that the peripheral nervous system and motor neurons develop during the embryonic stage and are only partially remodeled during metamorphosis.[9] Furthermore, Truman and his colleagues identified that neuroblasts in the ventral nerve cord originate specific neuronal lineages extending to different regions of the insect body, and that these neuroblasts are characterized by position, size, and manner in which they divide.[10] Currently, Truman and his colleagues at the University of Washington are focusing on characterizing these neuronal lineages in the Drosophila CNS.", "51002986": "Hilary Patricia Blumberg is a medical doctor and the inaugural John and Hope Furth Professor of Psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine.[1]  She is also a professor of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, and works in the Child Study Center at Yale where she has been a faculty member since 1998.

He is a professor and past chair of Loma Linda University Department of Earth and Biological Sciences.[2]/nAs a Creationist, he teaches interventionism, a view of history that holds that there is intelligent intervention in history.[3] [4]  His desire for respectful dialogue has been welcomed by advocates on both sides of the creation\u2013evolution controversy. He challenges his fellow creationists to use caution when making scientific claims./nHis most widely debated research was regarding fossil tracks at the Grand Canyon. He has a PhD in biology from Cornell University, received in 1970 when working for LLU La Sierra campus.[5]/nBrand began his scientific career in the study of small mammals. In 1968, Brand and Raymond Ryckman studied the systematics of deer mice (specifically the mainland cactus mouse and two related species isolated to nearby islands, the San Lorenzo and Angel Island mice. This was also the topic of Brand's masters. They confirmed the accepted taxonomy of these species, and showed that these species are still able to interbreed.[6]/nStarting in 1970, Brand reported on the tree nests and vocalisations of California chipmunks. This was also his PhD topic. Along with many other scientists, his reported methodologies and observations have added to the accumulating scientific knowledge of these mammals.[7]/nFrom 1999, the fossil remains of hundreds of whales (including the \"Leviathan\") were discovered as part of the Pisco formation in Peru. Brand and his associates studied the taphonomy of these well-articulated skeletons, and concluded that the burial of the whales in diatom sediment had been a very rapid event.[8] [9]/nIn 2000, Brand et al. have conducted field research on fossil turtles in the Bridger Formation of Wyoming.[10] [11]  He has also been involved in taphonomy experiments using modern animal carcasses, particularly intended to aid understanding of the features of fossil turtles.[12]/nIn the field of ichnology,  Brand, along with Thu Tang, Andrew A. Snelling, and Steven Austin[13] has proposed that fossil tracks in the Grand Canyon's Coconino Sandstone point to underwater deposition, rather than desert wind deposition of dry sand.[14] [15][16] [17] [18]   Brand and Tang studied western newts walking on sand under 4\u00a0cm of flowing water in an aquarium tank. By analogy, they concluded that at least part of the Coconino Sandstone was deposited under water.[19]  This hypothesis has been criticized by geologists who interpret evidence supporting sub-aerial formation.[20][21][22][23]/nGeologist Martin Lockley describes Brand's Salamander trackway study as \"seriously flawed\" and notes that Brand links the underwater tracks theory to the idea that the Grand Canyon was formed entirely by a catastrophic, biblical-style flood, a view which Lockley calls geologically naive and disingenuous. He criticizes Brand's book Faith, Reason and Earth History for \"leaving out any discussion of the objections published by geologists to his interpretation.\" Lockley does, however, commend Brand for admitting that creationists have made mistakes and that science-bashing can be counter-productive, for advocating respectful engagement, and for raising thought-provoking philosophical questions regarding evolution and sociobiology.[24]/nA number of studies have found evidence contradicting Brand and Tang's conclusions and Lockley and Hunt's 1995 book Dinosaur Tracks and Other Fossil Footprints of the Western United States suggests an alternative explanation with the tracks being made in air by extinct mammal-like reptiles called caseids. Inconsistencies that contradict the underwater hypothesis include:[19][23]/nApart from the controversy, his observations of underwater foot prints have been cited in peer-reviewed journals.[25][26][27][28]/nIn his report on laboratory controlled simulations of dinosaur footprints in sand, Simon J. Jackson cites eight scientists, including Brand. He says,/nExperimental studies with live animals have greatly contributed to our understanding of track formation and preservation. Several authors (e.g., Padian and Olsen, 1989; Farlow, 1989; Farlow and Pianka, 2000) have focused on how the gait and behavior of the trackmaker affects the resultant track and trackway morphology. Other studies (e.g., McKee, 1947; Brand, 1979, 1996; Gatesy et al., 1999; Milan 2006) have investigated how a range of media conditions, such as the moisture (i.e., water) content, interacts with the movement of the foot to produce a spectrum of footprints.[29]/nBrand has also been involved in research not published in mainstream scientific journals. In 1970 Berney Neufeld, Brand and Art Chadwick studied the controversial Paluxy tracks and, contrary to many creationists at that time, concluded that those tracks did not provide valid evidence for the coexistence of humans and dinosaurs.[30]/nOn November 9, 1972, the California State Board of Education held hearings to examine creation science.[31] Leonard Brand, along with Loma Linda University colleague Ariel Roth, made presentations. Brand contended that creationist views are misunderstood in that creationists also believe in evolution of species within the major groups of plants and animals.  The evidence for this was very good, he said. They \"have no argument with experimental evidence.\"[32] In conclusion, he stated that students in California schools should be allowed to hear both theories and form their own conclusions.[32]/nLeonard Brand has authored two books on the creation\u2013evolution controversy, Faith, Reason and Earth History (1997, 2nd Ed. 2009) and Beginnings (2007). Both are published in English and Spanish, and the former is also published in Portuguese.[33]/nIchnologist Martin Lockley wrote a critical review of FREH, accusing Brand of unscrupulousness and ignorance. He said the book \"shows us, on the one hand, a very curious mix of what appear to be a few genuine attempts, by creationists, to do good science, or at least better science than they have done in the past, and, on the other hand, what appear to be quite ridiculous and extraordinarily naive interpretations of classic geological localities such as the Grand Canyon.\"[34]/nYoung Earth Creationists include Leonard Brand among their leaders. They often cite his field and lab research as evidence for the biblical flood.[13][35] Marcus R. Ross of Liberty University includes Brand's Faith, Reason and Earth's History in a short list of \"well-researched YEC writings on geology.\" These \"excellent sources\" include Steven Austin, Kurt Wise, Leonard Brand and Andrew A. Snelling.[36] In August, 2008, Brand gave the keynote address at the Seventh Creation Biology Study Groups Conference entitled  \u201cOrigins Research: A Better Worldview Yields Better Research Questions.\u201d[37][38]/nBrand participates in the creation\u2013evolution controversy less confrontationally than many creationists.  Young and Stearley, two Christian geologists who disagree with Brand's young earth views, state that he, along with Ariel Roth and some other recent flood geology advocates \"have a much more irenic and moderate tone that provides a welcome contrast to the sarcastic, sometimes disrespectful tone and unwarrantedly dogmatic pronouncements of earlier creationists.\"[39] In a foreword to Brand's book Faith, Reason and Earth History[40] Kurt Wise applauds the book for breaking free from the \"science-bashing spirit\" prevalent in creationist literature.[41] Lockley suggests that Brand is \"writing for people of faith\" and that his more sympathetic approach may have a greater impact in \"educat[ing] creationists to a scientific way of thinking\" than the more confrontational approach of many anti-creationists.[24]/nBrand argues for integrity in creationist arguments, against using material that has many errors and writing \"without having the scientific training to match their zeal.\"[42]/nIn his PhD dissertation, Thomas McIver reports that:[43]/nZoologist Leonard Brand used live reptiles and amphibians in his lab to see how footprints were formed in different conditions: dry, damp, and wet sand, and when the animals were walking on sand underwater.  The underwater tracks, he concludes, resembles most closely fossil tracks such as found in the Grand Canyon\u2019s Coconino Sandstone.  This contradicts the evolutionist assumption of the desert origin of the sandstone, and supports the Flood model.  Brand has published these experiments both in GRI\u2019s journal Origins (1978) as well as a standard scientific journal (1979)./nBrand distinguishes between scientific data and presuppositions:/nThe difference between a creationist and an evolutionist isn't a difference in the scientific data, but a difference in philosophy \u2013 a difference in the presuppositions...[44]/nBrand teaches that his biblical views help him propose questions for research. On page 8 of the book Beginnings, he states,/nIn my approach, I retain the scientific method of observation and experimentation, but I also allow study of Scripture to open my eyes to things that I might otherwise overlook and to suggest new hypotheses to test. This approach is not just a theory; some of us have been using it for years with success.[45]/nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church has recognized Brand as a thought leader in matters of science and origins since the early 1970s. He has served on the SDA church's science council from 1976 to 2003.[46] He oversaw the development of the church's earth sciences program at Loma Linda University. He has taught science methodology in regional church conference and has explained creationist concepts to students in public colleges./nIn the area of doctrinal apologetics, Brand has published a book in response to the major critics of church founder Ellen G. White./nIn 1978, church leaders approved Loma Linda University's Department of Biology masters program in earth history. As head of the department, Brand explained the rationale for the program,/nOur objectives for the degree are two-fold. We want to train secondary teachers to teach earth history and to foster study in the earth sciences in the context of the various ideas of origins.\" He said that Adventists had neglected the fields of paleontology and geology even though they related significantly to the church's understanding of origins. According to Brand, it was important for the Adventist church to have teachers on all levels who could understand the conflict in these areas.[47]/nIn 2005, Don S. McMahon, an Australian medical specialist, and Leonard Brand co-authored the book The prophet and her critics.[48] It was published by the Pacific Press Publishing Association.[49] The core issue treated in their book is Ellen White's writings on health.[48][50] In the first four chapters, Brand reports on the earlier research of Ron Numbers on health (1976), Jon Butler on prophetic fulfilment (1979) and Walter Rea on literary relationships (1982). He proposes that these earlier research studies should be examined for their use of logic, interpretation of data, and whether they had good research designs.[50][undue weight?  \u2013 discuss]/nNumbers reports,/nBrand collaborated with McMahon in bringing McMahon's finding to the attention of American Adventists... the latter book (Brand and McMahon's) devotes a chapter to exposing the perceived weaknesses of Prophetess of Health, especially its failure to entertain \"the hypothesis of divine inspiration\" (p. 44)[48]/nHe criticises both of McMahon's books:[48]/nDespite their pretense to scientific rigor, McMahon's books are riddled with pseudoscientific claims, historical errors, and misleading comparisons.", "21282431": "Michael Alan Rice, (born March 4, 1955) is an American professor of fisheries and aquaculture at the University of Rhode Island and former state representative from South Kingstown, Rhode Island.

His father was a wealthy merchant who traded in ostrich feathers at the height of the plume trade.[4][5] The Salaman family were Ashkenazi Jews,[6] who according to Salaman, migrated to Britain from either Holland or the Rhineland in the early 18th century.[7]/nHe was educated at St Paul's School, London, where he studied classics and science, and became head boy of the school's Science Side. He obtained a scholarship at Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1893 and graduated with a first class degree in Natural Sciences in 1896, having studied physiology, zoology and chemistry. he was influenced by Michael Foster and was tutored and advised by the physiologist W. H. Gaskell, who later became a good friend of Salaman. While at Cambridge, he learned German from Solomon Schechter's wife.[8] He moved to the London Hospital in 1896 to study medicine and remained there until he qualified in 1900.[3] He then studied experimental pathology at W\u00fcrzburg and Berlin in 1901-2 before returning to London.[9]/nIn 1903, Salaman was appointed Director of the Pathological Institute at the London Hospital, but in 1904 he developed tuberculosis and had to stop practising medicine and spend six months in a Swiss sanitorium.[5][10] It took him over two years to fully recover from the illness. He purchased a house in Barley, Hertfordshire and, because he could not return to practising medicine, began experimenting in the emerging science of genetics under the guidance of his friend William Bateson.[3][10] After several failed experiments with a range of animals and seeking advice from his gardener, Salaman decided to experiment with potatoes. Later in his career, commenting on his decision to study potatoes, Salaman noted that he had \"embarked on an enterprise which, after forty years, leaves more questions unsolved than were thought at that time to exist. Whether it was mere luck, or whether the potato and I were destined for life partnership, I do not know, but from that moment my course was set, and I became ever more involved in problems associated directly or indirectly with a plant with which I had no particular affinity, gustatory or romantic\".[10]/nWorking in his private garden, he initially set out to cross two potato varieties and establish which traits were dominant and recessive in a similar manner to Gregor Mendel's work on peas, but he soon broadened into other areas. In 1908, he decided to include wild potatoes in his experiments and requested that Kew Gardens provide him with Solanum maglia. Kew's stocks had been incorrectly labelled, however, and Salaman was sent Solanum edinense instead. In 1909, Salaman grew 40 self-fertilised crosses of S. edinense and found that seven of them did not succumb to late blight (Phytophthora infestans). Convinced that resistance to late blight existed in wild species he began to study other species and found that Solanum demissum was also resistant to blight. Salaman started to cross S. demissum with domesticated varieties of potato in 1911 to produce high yielding lines that were also resistant to late blight. By 1914, he had successfully created hybrids and in 1926 he remarked that he had produced varieties with \"reasonably good economic characteristics which, no matter what their maturity, appeared to be immune to late blight.[10] Salaman was the first to identify genetic resistance to late blight and S. demissum was still used as a source of resistance in the 1950s.[3] In The Propitious Esculent, John Reader called Salaman's discovery \"an important breakthrough, offering real promise ... that it was possible to breed blight-resistant potato varieties\".[10] In 1987, it was thought that half of the potato varieties cultivated in Europe contained genes from S. demissum.[11]/nIn 1910, he published a paper on the inheritance of colour in potato in the first issue of the Journal of Genetics.[12] Later papers in the Journal of Agricultural Science examined male sterility,[13] methods for estimating yields[14] detecting viruses in seed potatoes[15] and a study of how the size of seed tubers affected the yield and size of tubers of the crop.[14][16] He wrote the book Potato Varieties in 1929.[4]/nHis research on potatoes was disrupted by the outbreak of the First World War, during which Salaman joined the Royal Army Medical Corps and served in Palestine. Afterwards he was appointed chairman of the potato synonym committee at the National Institute of Agricultural Botany where he was tasked with describing potato varieties and putting an end to the common practice of marketing old and unreliable varieties under new names. His work there culminated in the publication of Potato Varieties in 1926. The same year he persuaded the Ministry of Agriculture to establish the Potato Virus Research Institute in Cambridge, of which he remained a director until 1939.[5] Kenneth Manley Smith was an entomologist at the institute and Frederick Charles Bawden became Salaman's assistant in 1930. Smith and Bawden went on to become renowned plant virologists.[17] In conjunction with Paul A. Murphy of Dublin. a large stock of virus-free potatoes was built up and multiplied in greenhouses, a practice which continued after his death and was adopted in other countries.[3] His research on viruses lead to him being elected to the Royal Society in 1935.[5]/nSalaman authored The History and Social Influence of the Potato first published in 1949, reprinted in 1970,[18] and revised under the guidance of his former doctoral student Jack Hawkes in 1987.[11] A review of the first edition in the British Journal of Sociology noted that it was an \"unusual and vastly interesting book which took nine years to write, and a life-time to prepare\" combining genetics, history and archaeology.[19] The book covers every aspect of the history of the potato with a particular focus on Ireland, about which he wrote \"in no other country can [potato's] influence on the domestic and economic life of the people be studied to greater advantage\".[18][20]/nThe historian Eric Hobsbawm referred to the work as \"that magnificent monument of scholarship and humanity\".[21] A 1999 paper in Potato Research noted that because of Salaman's \"unprecedented\" book, we \"know more about the impact of the diffusion of potato on the welfare of people, particularly the poor, than about such consequences following the introduction of any other major food plant.\"[22]/nSalaman also took an interest in eugenics with a special interest in Jews and the supposed unique genetic traits. He tried to characterize the typical Jewish face and considered that the separation of Sephardis and Ashkenazis had led to divergent characters. He published these ideas in the first volume of the newly founded Journal of Genetics in 1911.[23] His work was critiqued by Harold Laski who writing in Biometrika in 1912, called it \"scientifically ludicrous\".[24]/nSalaman was a proponent of Zionism and Jewish causes, and in 1907, he was elected president of the English Zionist Federation.[25]/nIn his academic life, he was president of the Jewish Historical Society, a council member for the Jews\u2019 College (today the London School of Jewish Studies), a founder of the Jewish Health Organization of Great Britain, and a member of the board of governors of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.[25][26]/nIn 1933, he was a founding member of the Academic Assistance Council, which helped scientists fleeing the Nazi regime, and in 1945 was chairman of the Jewish Committee for Relief Abroad as it worked to rehabilitate survivors of the extermination camps.[25]/nOn 23 October 1901, Salaman married Hebrew scholar Nina Ruth Davis, whom he had met four months earlier at the New West End Synagogue. They were engaged ten days after meeting. After living in Berlin for several months, while Redcliffe completed advanced training in pathology, they returned to London, where he assumed the directorship of the Pathological Institute at the London Hospital.[27] They had six children including the pathologist Myer Head Salaman\u00a0[Wikidata], the doctor Arthur Gabriel Salaman, the engineer Raphael Salaman, the artist Ruth Collet[28] and the singer Esther Sarah Salaman\u00a0[Wikidata].[29] They settled in the country, in the village of Barley in Hertfordshire, where they lived with their six children (one of whom died in childhood). Nina Salaman continued to pursue her interest in medieval Hebrew poetry. Despite Barley's distance from London, she maintained a kosher home and Sabbath observance.

Boman was born on 16 August 1924 in Engelbrekt Parish, Stockholm, Sweden, and died on 3 December 2008. Boman's pioneering research on insect immunity formed the basis for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine that was awarded to Jules Hoffman in 2011.[1]/nHans G. Boman graduated from Uppsala University, where he obtained his PhD in biochemistry in 1958 with Professor Arne Tiselius. He completed his post-doctoral studies at the Rockefeller Institute in New York. During his stay in New York, he married Anita Boman, who then became his main research partner. They returned to Sweden and Uppsala University in 1960 where he established a research group at the Department of Biochemistry. In 1966 Boman was appointed professor of microbiology at Ume\u00e5 University. Between 1966 and 1976 he built up the Department of Microbiology at Ume\u00e5 University, where his research focused on mechanisms for bacterial antibiotic resistance. Boman combined physiological, molecular, biochemical and genetic methods in a way that was unique at that time. In 1976, Boman became professor of microbiology at Stockholm University where his work in moths identified the first antimicrobial peptides of animals in 1981. He later moved to the Microbiological and Tumor Biology Center at the Karolinska Institute in 1997. At the Karolinska Institute, he identified a disease that occurs in connection with antimicrobial peptides.[2]/nDuring his time in Ume\u00e5, Boman collaborated with Bertil Rasmusson at the Department of Genetics. In a famous back-and-forth exchange, Boman put forth unto Rasmusson: \"'Do fruit flies ever get sick?' (Boman). 'Very rarely,' (Rasmuson). 'Then they must have an efficient immune response!' (Boman).\" Their work asked how insects can survive infections without having a system of B cells and T cells, at the time thought to be essential for immune defence.[3] They examined the immune system of fruit flies and could show that flies that were once infected with a non-lethal dose of the bacterium Pseudomonas survived a second higher dose while flies that received the same high dose for the first time died./nBoman continued to investigate the immune response of insects, focussing on the proteins induced by immune challenge. This posed technical challenges that required a larger insect capable of donating more hemolymph (insect blood). His eventual choice was the Cecropia silk moth (Hyalophora cecropia)./nIn 1981, Boman's group published the protein structure of the antimicrobial peptide cecropin, the first animalian antimicrobial peptide described.[4] With techniques for cloning genes, Boman's group was able to continue studies on immune genes in Cecropia. At the same time, the field of innate immunity rapidly expanded, benefitting from the genetic tools available in Drosophila in the search to understand how insect immunity recognizes and signals following infection. From these initial studies, a number of insect antimicrobial peptides and other immune proteins were characterized, and these peptides have been used extensively as readouts of immune challenge. Owing to Boman's discovery, immune-inducible peptides were used to identify competent or deficient immune responses, ultimately leading to the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine being awarded to Jules Hoffmann for his work on insect immune signalling.[5]/nBoman was awarded the Fernstr\u00f6m Prize for outstanding work in medicine in 2000.

He is considered one of the most influential botanists of the 20th century, largely due to his formulation of the Cronquist system as well as being the primary co-author to the Flora of the Pacific Northwest, still the most up to date flora for three northwest U.S. States to date. Two plant genera in the aster family have been named in his honor. These are Cronquistia, a possible synonym of Carphochaete, and Cronquistianthus, which is sometimes included as a group within Eupatorium. The former was applied by R.M. King and the latter by him and Harold E. Robinson./nArthur Cronquist was born on March 19, 1919, in San Jose, California, but he grew up outside of Portland, Oregon, as well as in Pocatello, Idaho. His parents divorced when he was young and he and his older sister were brought up by his mother, who worked for the Union Pacific Railroad in Pocatello. The young boy was an avid member of the Boy Scouts of America, through which he gained an appreciation for the outdoors. He did his undergraduate work at the Southern Branch of the University of Idaho (now Idaho State University). During his time there he studied field botany under Ray J. Davis, who was compiling the Flora of Idaho at the time. After receiving his bachelor's degree in 1938 in Biology, he went on to earn a master's degree in biology at Utah State University in 1940 working under Bassett Maguire. In the same year he married Mabel Allred, who he remained with until his death. They had two children and a fondness for cats./nDue to a childhood accident, Cronquist's right arm was partially disabled, making him unfit for military service in World War II. Instead he began work on his doctorate at the University of Minnesota under C.O. Rosendahl, earning his PhD in botany in 1944. His dissertation was a revision of the genus Erigeron. In 1943, while still working on his doctorate, he was offered a position at the New York Botanical Garden to work on Asteraceae for \"The New Britton & Brown Illustrated Flora\" then in preparation by Henry Gleason. From 1946 to 1948 he held a position at the University of Georgia, followed by a three-year position at Washington State University. Before returning to the New York Botanical Garden where he would spend the rest of his career, he worked as a botanist in Brussels with the U.S. Foreign Aid Program from 1951 to 1952. He died of heart failure on March 22, 1992, while studying specimens of Mentzelia at the herbarium at Brigham Young University./nWhile Cronquist was in his mid-thirties, he began to question the usefulness of Adolf Engler & Karl Prantl's taxonomic system, laid down in their work Die Nat\u00fcrlichen Pflanzenfamilien (The Natural Plant Families), which had been the dominant system since the late 19th century. Although Cronquist was originally involved mostly with the family Asteraceae rather than with general systems, he began publishing on the topic in 1957 after much discussion with his peers concerning the challenge of forming a new taxonomic system. His initial publication (Cronquist, 1957) dealt purely with dicotyledons. At the time he began his work on his general scheme of classification, several others were working with the same goal in mind, including the American Robert F. Thorne, the Dane Rolf Dahlgren, and Armen Takhtajan of the U.S.S.R. Each of them would go on to produce their own taxonomic schemes, though Cronquist's would prove to be the most widely adopted. While working on the project in the 1960s, Cronquist came to be close friends with Armen Takhtajan and both men put all of their information at one another's disposal. To this end Cronquist decided to learn Russian in order to have access to the scientific literature that the Soviet Union had accumulated, which was largely unknown to the rest of the world. He made several trips to the U.S.S.R. to meet with Takhtajan and other Soviet botanists and translated many botanical works from Russian throughout his life./nCronquist's first overview of classification was published in 1960,[2] followed by his The Evolution and Classification of Flowering Plants in 1968 with a revised and expanded second edition being released in 1988.[3] This work also was a survey of the practices of systematic botany. In 1981 he published his landmark work, An Integrated System of Classification of Flowering Plants. The work divided flowering plants into 2 classes with a number of subclasses and down to the family level, with each taxon being described and defined. The system would go on to be adopted by several major projects in floristics, including the Jepson Manual (1993), Flora of North America, Flora of China, Flora of Australia and of course Gleason and Cronquist's Manual of the Vascular Plants, which was published in 1991./nProfessor Cronquist was also a passionate and dedicated teacher who mentored countless students. He was a role model for what it meant to be a plant biologist and taxonomist. Among those who knew him, his baritone voice among the herbarium stacks will continue to chill the soul and warm the heart.[tone]/nArthur Cronquist is probably best remembered for his work dealing with his Cronquist system, which was developed in these and other works:", "61292347": "Lawrence Richard Heaney (born December 2, 1952, in Washington, DC ) is an American mammalogist, ecologist and biogeographer.

She is a professor at The Scripps Research Institute, located in La Jolla, California.[1] Her work has contributed to the establishment of physiological importance of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases beyond their classical role in supporting mRNA translation and their disordered processes that contribute to disease. She founded the Translation Machinery in Health and Disease Gordon Research Conference,[2] an ongoing biannual international conference since 2015. She helped co-found aTyr Pharma,[3] a Nasdaq-listed biotechnology company./nXiang-Lei Yang was born in Changsha in Southern China, as the younger child of Benlian Yang (\u6768\u672c\u6fc2) and Xiulan Gu (\u8c37\u79c0\u5170). Before she was born, Yang's father was a lecturer at PLA Military Institute of Engineering in Harbin in Northeast China, where her sister Danzhou Yang (\u6768\u4e39\u6d32) was born.  The souring of relations between communist China with the Soviet Union in the 1960s, known as the Sino-Soviet split,  led to countrywide strategic relocations and caused Yang's parents and sister to migrate over 2600 kilometers to Changsha where Xiang-Lei Yang was born.  Her father became a professor at National University of Defense Technology in Changsha teaching Applied Mathematics. With a great admiration for science and technology, her parents encouraged both sisters to become scientists from a young age. Unlike her sister, who had always been a stellar student, Xiang-Lei was rebellious and lacked motivation. After attending college at Capital University of Medical Sciences in Beijing, she moved back to her hometown but decided soon that there was no future for her in Changsha. With the help of her sister, she became a graduate student in the lab of Andrew H. J. Wang at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where she learned both NMR and X-ray crystallography techniques to determine atomic structures of DNA molecules and to study their interaction with drug-like small molecules.[4] In 1999 Yang was received the Harvey Van Cleave Research Award for a graduate student at the University of Illinois.Yang earned her Ph.D. degree in 2000./nBased on strong encouragement from her Ph.D. advisor, Yang joined the lab of Paul Schimmel at The Scripps Research Institute as a postdoctoral scientist. \u00a0The Schimmel lab had just discovered that a member of the human aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family (tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase; TyrRS), used for supporting protein synthesis in the cytosol, can also be secreted out of the cell, where it can be activated by proteolysis to release cytokine-like functions for cell signaling purpose.[5] The first project Yang undertook in the Schimmel lab was to solve the crystal structure of the human TyrRS to understand the structural basis forthis  cytokine activation. She successfully determined the structure[6] and, after screening hundreds of crystals, pushed the resolution to 1.18 \u00c5, the highest resolution for any atomic structure of an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases thus far. Her research elucidated the mechanism of cytokine activation that led to a constitutively activated form of full-length TyrRS.[7]/nYang became an assistant professor at The Scripps Research Institute Department of Molecular Medicine in 2005.  She was promoted to associate professor in 2008 and to tenured full professor in 2014.[1]  At Scripps, she has continued making scientific advances in this field while running her own research laboratory.  Yang and her lab have solved the first crystal structure of many human aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS). These not only provided the structural basis for various functions of tRNA synthetases, but also revealed intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in human human tRNA synthetases in contrast to their counterparts in lower organisms. Yang proposed that these IDRs play an important role in expanding the tRNA synthetase \u2018functionome\u2019 during evolution.[8]/nWhile working on structure analysis of tRNA synthetases, Yang  encountered a significant knowledge gap in the field, which was the physiological role of the \u2018new\u2019 functions of tRNA synthetases. Yang looked for the connection to human diseases.  Her initial focus was on a neurodegenerative disease called Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), because the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are the largest gene family causatively linked to CMT .[9][10] The Yang lab and their collaborators extensively studied the canonical enzymatic function of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases in relation to CMT and excluded a loss-of-function disease mechanism.[11] Instead, their work has established that dysregulations of regulatory functions of tRNA synthetases contribute critically to the etiology of CMT disease,[12][13] uncovering yet another new role for human aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases beyond their classical enzymatic activity. Work on seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) demonstrated for the first time that an appended domain dispensable for enzymatic activity of SerRS can be essential for the development of vertebrates.[14]/nDemonstration of these broader physiological  roles embedded in the genes of human aminoacyl tRNA synthetases has caused a paradigm shift in the field of human genetics and has led to new avenues for therapeutic approaches to treat a wide variety of human diseases such as inflammatory disease, autoimmune disease,[15] cancer and  neurological disorders.[16]   In 2005, Schimmel and Yang founded aTyr Pharma,[3] a biotechnology company pursuing tRNA synthetase derived molecules, for therapeutic applications./nThe Yang lab has unveiled broad regulatory roles of tRNA synthetases in vascular biology, the circulatory system, stress response,[17] and proteostasis[18] and provided in-depth mechanistic understanding of these non-canonical functions at the levels of whole organisms, cells, and molecules./nYang has published over 80 peer-reviewed papers and is an inventor on 3 issued US patents and 9 pending US patent applications", "7880534": "Rebecca Craighill Lancefield (January 5, 1895 \u2013 March 3, 1981)[1] was a prominent American microbiologist. She joined the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (now Rockefeller University) in New York in 1918, and was associated with that institute throughout her long and outstanding career. Her bibliography comprises more than 50 publications published over 60 years./nLancefield is best known for her serological classification of \u03b2-hemolytic streptococcal bacteria,[2] Lancefield grouping, which is based on the carbohydrate composition of bacterial antigens found on their cell walls.[3] She is also responsible for the serological typing of Group A Streptococci./nLancefield was born at Fort Wadsworth, Staten Island, New York. Her father was an officer in the US Army Engineer Corps.[1] She attended Wellesley College in Massachusetts. After graduating in 1916 with a degree in zoology, she taught math and science at a girls school in Vermont for one year.[4] She accepted a scholarship to Teachers' College, Columbia University, and continued to study bacteriology.[5] Lancefield received her master's degree from Columbia in 1918. The same year, she married Donald E. Lancefield, a fellow graduate student in genetics at Columbia. After graduation, she worked as a technician for Oswald Avery and Alphonse Dochez at Rockefeller. The following year, she returned to Columbia to study on Drosophila willistoni under Charles W. Metz.[6]/nLancefield's first co-authored paper was published in 1919 when she was a technician, an unusual recognition at the time. Previous to this work, researchers did not know if different streptococcal strains were biologically distinct. Working with Avery and Dochez, she identified four serological types that classified 70 percent of the \u03b2-hemolytic streptococcal strains they were studying.[2]/nFor her PhD thesis, Lancefield studied viridans streptococci. Lancefield originally joined the lab of Hans Zinsser. Zinsser did not want to work with women, and suggested she move her work to the lab of Homer Swift.[4] Therefore, the majority of her work was carried out at Rockefeller, where Swift's lab was located. At the time, viridans streptococci were incorrectly believed to contribute to rheumatic fever. Lancefield's thesis work helped dispel this idea.[1]/nAfter her PhD, Lancefield returned to studying \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci at Rockefeller. She now aimed to identify the biological components of surface antigens located on the bacteria. In 1928, Lancefield reported that the type-specific antigen of streptococci was a protein. She named this protein the M-protein because a matt colony occurs when the bacteria is exposed to the antigen.[7] Lancefield discovered that the group-specific antigen of streptococci was composed of carbohydrates, which she named the C-carbohydrate. Within this discovery, Lancefield revealed that the C-carbohydrate was not species-specific, as originally thought.[7] This realization prompted her development of a classification system, called Lancefield grouping, for streptococcal diseases. She initially designated group A for human streptococcal infections and group B for bovine streptococcal infections. Today, Lancefield groups includes groups A through M.[7]/nLancefield discovered two additional group A streptococci surface proteins: the T-antigen, in 1940, and the R-antigen, in 1957. Later in her career, she focused on group B streptococci. Her research revealed that group B streptococci lacked the M-protein. She discovered that, instead, surface polysaccharides were responsible for their virulence factor.[7]/nDuring World War II, Lancefield served on the Commission on Streptococcal and Staphylococcal Diseases of the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board.  In 1946, Lancefield was promoted to associate member at Rockefeller University. She was promoted to full member and professor at Rockefeller in 1958.  Lancefield was a long-time collaborator of Maclyn McCarty and a mentor of Emil Gotschlich, two recipients of the notable Lasker Prize.[7]/nIn 1943, she was the second woman to become president of the Society of American Bacteriologists. In 1961, she became president of the American Association of Immunologists, the first woman to hold the position. She was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1970. In 1973, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science by Rockefeller University. She was formally honored by Wellesley College, her alma mater, in 1976. Lancefield received many awards, including the T. Duckett Jones Award of the Helen Hay Whitney Foundation, the American Heart Association Achievement Award, and the Medal of the New York Academy of Medicine.[1]/nLancefield's recipe for eggnog has been used by her fellow scientists for decades and was published on Science Friday.[8]/nDue to Lancefield's willingness to answer microbiological questions, her lab at Rockefeller earned the nickname \"the Scotland Yard of streptococcal mysteries.\"[7]/nThe Lancefield International Symposium on Streptococci and Streptococcal Diseases is named in her honor.[4] The samples collected over her career are now maintained by Rockefeller University as the Lancefield collection.

He \"stands as one of the true giants in the history of biology and belongs in the same pantheon as Darwin and Mendel.\"[1] Largely self-taught he was the first to study and establish alternation of generations and the details of sexual reproduction in the bryophytes./nHofmeister and his sister Clementine were the children of Friederich and Frederike (nee Seidenschnur) Hofmeister.[1] His father was a book and music publisher and seller in Leipzig. He left vocational high school (Realschule) at the age of 15 and was apprenticed in a bookshop in Hamburg by an acquaintance of his father. He met  Muriel Agnes Lurgenstein and they married in 1847,[1] subsequently having nine children. That same year, he was initiated freemasonry at Lodge Apollo in Hamburg.[2] She (died 28 March 1870) and seven children pre-deceased him.[3] His second marriage to Johanna Schmidt on 26 February 1876 was short because he died in 1877 following several strokes.[1]/nHe did most of his research in his free-time, largely from four to six in the morning before going to work.[4] Nevertheless, he was only 27 when he published his ground-breaking monograph on the alternation of generations in plants. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Rostock in 1851.[1] Not until 1863 was he employed as a Professor, and Director of the Botanic Garden, at the University of Heidelberg. In 1872, he moved to the University of T\u00fcbingen.[5][6][7]/nHofmeister is widely credited with discovery of alternation of generations as a general principle in plant life. His proposal that alternation between a spore-bearing generation (sporophyte) and a gamete-bearing generation (gametophyte) constituted a unifying theory of plant evolution that was published in 1851. This was crucial in demonstrating that sexual reproduction occurred in plants, which was under extensive debate in the mid-1800s. He showed that products from both the pollen tube and egg were required.[3] This discovery and unifying principle of plant reproduction occurred eight years before Darwin's On the Origin of Species was published.[8] After this book was published, Hofmeister became a leading proponent of Darwinism.[9]/nHofmeister was also an early student of the genetics in plants. He is cited for the first studies of plant embryology. According to C. D. Darlington, Hofmeister had observed what would later be called chromosomes in a dividing cell nucleus as early as 1848. He left detailed sketches which are reproduced in Darlington's The Facts of Life, though he was not the first to observe them. There is good evidence that Gregor Mendel was aware of Hofmeister's work and this was part of his motivation to study plant hybridisation.[1]/nHis books Die Lehre von der Pflanzenzelle (1867) and Allgemeine Morphologie der Gew\u00e4chse (1868) were about plant cells and morphology. They contained very detailed descriptions and illustrations from microscopic study of plant cell structure and internal organisation. The cell wall was a particular focus. He observed that plant cells expand and then divide with a new wall laid down in the centre of the cell. During this growth he recorded that the cell walls swell in the direction of growth, corresponding to layers and striations in the wall. He thus identified a fundamental difference between development in plants and animals since animal cells have to migrate as organs develop.  His book on plant morphology in 1868 included studies of growth responses to response to environmental stimuli, particularly gravitropism and phototropism. He carried out experiments to measure the forces and tensions involved as plant stems bend. Charles Darwin referred to Hofmeister's studies extensively in his own book The Power of Movement in\nPlants (1880).[3]/nIn 1869, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences./nHofmeister's contribution to biology is still far from widely acknowledged.[1] This may partly be attributed to the fact that only one of his works was translated from German to English. However, Kaplan & Cooke[1] conclude that \"his reputation became eclipsed because he was so far ahead of his contemporaries that no one could understand or appreciate his work\".

His parents owned a pharmacy, and he was drawn to chemistry at a young age.[4] He entered the Free University of Berlin in 1973 to study chemistry, but the rigid way of teaching science did not engage him. Instead, Walter became interested in biochemistry, which studies the chemistry of cells.[4][5]/nIn the last year of his Vordiplom (equivalent to a BSc) in 1976, he went on exchange to Vanderbilt University and conducted research under Thomas M. Harris at the Department of Chemistry on the biosynthetic pathway of slaframine, a fungal alkaloid that is toxic to cows.[6] Eventually, Walter completed his MSc in Vanderbilt in 1977.[1]/nAt the encouragement of Stanford Moore, a biochemistry professor at Rockefeller University and a trustee of Vanderbilt, Walter applied for the PhD programme at Rockefeller.[6] He was placed on the waiting list, but after an accepted student went to Harvard University instead, was offered his place in 1977.[4][5] He took his PhD under G\u00fcnter Blobel, and obtained the degree in 1981.[1]/nAfter receiving his PhD, Walter stayed at Rockefeller University as a postdoctoral fellow for a year, then became an assistant professor at the Laboratory of Cell Biology at Rockefeller.[1]/nIn 1983, he moved to the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) as an assistant professor. Walter was promoted to associate professor in 1986 and then full professor in five years later.[1] He was chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics of UCSF between 2001 and 2008.[7]/nWalter became a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator in 1997, and served as the president of the American Society for Cell Biology in 2016.[8]/nIn 2021, there were reports that he would be joining Altos Labs, a new biotechnology company which reportedly focuses on anti-aging research.[9][10] The next year, he retired from UCSF and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 2022,[11][12] and joined Altos Labs as the Director of the Bay Area Institute of Science when the company officially launched.[13][14]/nWalter currently sits on the Scientific Advisory Board of the Zentrum f\u00fcr Molekulare Biologie der Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg of Heidelberg University.[15]/nWalter is a coauthor of the widely used textbook Molecular Biology of the Cell.[16]/n[1]\n[2]/nDuring his PhD at G\u00fcnter Blobel's group, Walter purified a protein complex required for moving proteins out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)[17] and showed the complex selectively recognizes newly synthesized secretory proteins.[18] He later confirmed the complex is in fact a nucleoprotein and identified the RNA component essential for the complex's function. He also named the complex signal recognition particle (SRP).[19]/nBy the time Walter joined the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), researchers have established a connection between misfolded proteins in the ER and increased expression of a protein called BiP, which is a chaperone protein that helps other proteins fold correctly. This pathway is termed the unfolded protein response (UPR). However, how cells sense misfolded proteins and relays this information to the cell nucleus to increase the production of UPR-target proteins remains unclear.[20]/nIn 1993, working on baker's yeast, Walter found a gene, IRE1, which encodes a kinase. The IRE1 protein is located across the ER membrane, so a part of it can detect unfolded proteins inside the ER and the other part can phosphorylate proteins outside of the ER.[21] The same year, Kazutoshi Mori, at the time a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, independently made the same discovery.[22]/nWalter and Mori next independently sought the phosphorylation target of the IRE1 protein. Theoretically, upon phosphorylation, this target will enter the cell nucleus and increase the production of UPR-target proteins. Both of them arrived at the same gene, HAC1, in 1996.[23][24] This discovery, however, was unexpected as the HAC1 protein is produced only after IRE1 detects unfolded proteins, meaning the protein is not present to be phosphorylated by IRE1./nThis difference was mitigated by the finding of Mori and Walter that after IRE1 senses unfolded proteins, it splices the HAC1 precursor mRNA, which is transcribed from the HAC1 gene, resulting in a mature mRNA that is translated into the HAC1 protein.[25][26] Walter also discovered the phosphorylation target of IRE1, which turned out to be another IRE1 molecule, a process known as trans-autophosphorylation,[27] and also the enzyme stitching the spliced precursor HAC1 mRNA together.[28]/nIn 2013, Walter's group identified a molecule that inhibits the integrated stress response (ISR). The ISR is the cell's response to stresses such as viral infection, ultraviolet light and the accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins. ISR activates the EIF2\u03b1  protein, reducing most protein synthesis and increasing the production of some regulatory molecules.[29] His group found the inhibitor reversed EIF2\u03b1 activation, and named it ISRIB for \"integrated stress response inhibitor\". Remarkably, they found mice injected with ISRIB had improved memory.[30] ISRIB was licensed to Alphabet subsidiary Calico in 2015.[31]/nWalter is married to Patricia Caldera-Mu\u00f1oz,[52] whom he met in New York City during his PhD years at Rockefeller University and when Caldera-Mu\u00f1oz was a chemistry PhD student at New York University.[5] Before retiring, Caldera-Mu\u00f1oz worked at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Science and Health Education Partnership, where she coordinated outreach to local science teachers.[53][54]/nWalter was diagnosed with neck cancer in 2009.[55]", "65355625": "Holger Valdemar Br\u00f8ndsted (1893\u20131977) was a Danish zoologist, teacher and writer.[1]/nHe earned his first degree from Aarhus University, and then studied natural sciences at the University of Copenhagen.

In his first book, The Silent World: A Story of Undersea Discovery and Adventure, Cousteau surmised the existence of the echolocation abilities of porpoises. The book was adapted into an underwater documentary called The Silent World. Co-directed by Cousteau and Louis Malle, it was one of the first films to use underwater cinematography to document the ocean depths in color.

Now, as never before, the old phrase has a literal meaning: We are all in the same boat.\"/nJacques Cousteau/nCousteau was born on 11 June 1910, in Saint-Andr\u00e9-de-Cubzac, Gironde, France, to Daniel and \u00c9lisabeth Cousteau. He had one brother, Pierre-Antoine. Cousteau completed his preparatory studies at the Coll\u00e8ge Stanislas in Paris. In 1930, he entered the \u00c9cole navale and graduated as a gunnery officer. However, an automobile accident, which broke both his arms, cut short his career in naval aviation. The accident forced Cousteau to change his plans to become a naval pilot, so he then indulged his passion for the ocean.[2]/nIn Toulon, where he was serving on the Condorcet, Cousteau carried out his first underwater experiments, thanks to his friend Philippe Tailliez who in 1936 lent him some Fernez underwater goggles, predecessors of modern swimming goggles.[1] Cousteau also belonged to the information service of the French Navy, and was sent on missions to Shanghai and Japan (1935\u20131938) and in the USSR (1939).[3]/nOn 12 July 1937, he married Simone Melchior, his business partner,[4] with whom he had two sons, Jean-Michel (born 1938) and Philippe (1940\u20131979). His sons took part in the adventures of the Calypso. In 1991, six months after his wife Simone's death from cancer, he married Francine Triplet. They already had a daughter Diane Cousteau (born 1980) and a son, Pierre-Yves Cousteau (born 1982, during Cousteau's marriage to his first wife)./nThe years of World War II were decisive for the history of diving. After the armistice of 1940, the family of Simone and Jacques-Yves Cousteau took refuge in Meg\u00e8ve, where he became a friend of the Ichac family who also lived there. Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Marcel Ichac shared the same desire to reveal to the general public unknown and inaccessible places\u00a0\u2014 for Cousteau the underwater world and for Ichac the high mountains. The two neighbors took the first ex-aequo prize of the Congress of Documentary Film in 1943, for the first French underwater film: Par dix-huit m\u00e8tres de fond (18 meters deep), made without breathing apparatus the previous year in the Embiez islands in Var, with Philippe Tailliez and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dumas, using a depth-pressure-proof camera case developed by mechanical engineer L\u00e9on V\u00e8che, an engineer of Arts and Measures at the Naval College./nIn 1943, they made the film \u00c9paves (Shipwrecks), in which they used two of the very first Aqua-Lung prototypes. These prototypes were made in Boulogne-Billancourt by the Air Liquide company, following instructions from Cousteau and \u00c9mile Gagnan.[5] When making \u00c9paves, Cousteau could not find the necessary blank reels of movie film, but had to buy hundreds of small still camera film reels the same width, intended for a make of child's camera, and cemented them together to make long reels.[6][7]/nHaving kept bonds with the English speakers (he spent part of his childhood in the United States and usually spoke English) and with French soldiers in North Africa (under Admiral Lemonnier), Jacques-Yves Cousteau (whose villa \"Baobab\" at Sanary (Var) was opposite Admiral Darlan's villa \"Reine\"), helped the French Navy to join again with the Allies; he assembled a commando operation against the Italian espionage services in France, and received several military decorations for his deeds. At that time, he kept his distance from his brother Pierre-Antoine Cousteau, a \"pen anti-semite\" who edited the collaborationist newspaper Je suis partout (I am everywhere) and who received the death sentence in 1946. However, this was later commuted to a life sentence, and Pierre-Antoine was released in 1954./nDuring the 1940s, Cousteau is credited with improving the Aqua-Lung design which gave birth to the open-circuit scuba technology used today. According to his first book, The Silent World: A Story of Undersea Discovery and Adventure (1953), Cousteau started diving with Fernez goggles in 1936, and in 1939 used the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus invented in 1926 by Commander Yves le Prieur.[6] Cousteau was not satisfied with the length of time he could spend underwater with the Le Prieur apparatus so he improved it to extend underwater duration by adding a demand regulator, invented in 1942 by \u00c9mile Gagnan.[6] In 1943 Cousteau tried out the first prototype Aqua-Lung which finally made extended underwater exploration possible./nIn 1946, Cousteau and Tailliez showed the film \u00c9paves (\"Shipwrecks\") to Admiral Lemonnier, who gave them the responsibility of setting up the GRS (Groupement de Recherches Sous-marines, Underwater Research Group) of the French Navy in Toulon. A little later it became the GERS (Groupe d'\u00c9tudes et de Recherches Sous-Marines, Underwater Studies and Research Group), then the COMISMER (Commandement des Interventions Sous la Mer, Undersea Interventions Command), and finally the CEPHISMER (Centre Expert Plong\u00e9e Humaine et Intervention Sous la Mer, Expert Centre for Human Diving and Undersea Intervention). In 1947, Chief Petty Officer Maurice Fargues became the first diver to die using an Aqua-Lung, while attempting a new depth record to 120\u00a0m with the GERS near Toulon.[8]/nIn 1948, between missions of mine clearance, underwater exploration and technological and physiological tests, Cousteau undertook a first campaign in the Mediterranean on board the sloop \u00c9lie Monnier,[9][10] with Philippe Tailliez, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dumas, Jean Alinat and the scenario writer Marcel Ichac. The small team also undertook the exploration of the Roman wreck of Mahdia (Tunisia). It was the first underwater archaeology operation using autonomous diving, opening the way for scientific underwater archaeology. Cousteau and Marcel Ichac brought back from there the Carnets diving film (presented and preceded with the Cannes Film Festival 1951)./nCousteau and the \u00c9lie Monnier then took part in the rescue of Professor Jacques Piccard's bathyscaphe, the FNRS-2, during the 1949 expedition to Dakar. Thanks to this rescue, the French Navy was able to reuse the sphere of the bathyscaphe to construct the FNRS-3./nThe adventures of this period are told in the two books The Silent World (1953, by Cousteau and Dumas) and Plong\u00e9es sans c\u00e2ble (1954, by Philippe Tailliez)./nIn 1949, Cousteau left the French Navy./nIn 1950, he founded the French Oceanographic Campaigns (FOC), and leased a ship called Calypso from Thomas Loel Guinness for a symbolic one franc a year. Cousteau refitted the Calypso as a mobile laboratory for field research and as his principal vessel for diving and filming. He also carried out underwater archaeological excavations in the Mediterranean, in particular at Grand-Conglou\u00e9 (1952)./nWith the publication of his first book in 1953, The Silent World, Cousteau correctly predicted the existence of the echolocation abilities of porpoises. He reported that his research vessel, the \u00c9lie Monier, was heading to the Straits of Gibraltar and noticed a group of porpoises following them. Cousteau changed course a few degrees off the optimal course to the center of the strait, and the porpoises followed for a few minutes, then diverged toward mid-channel again. It was evident that they knew where the optimal course lay, even if the humans did not. Cousteau concluded that the cetaceans had something like sonar, which was a relatively new feature on submarines./nIn 1954, Cousteau conducted a survey of Abu Dhabi waters on behalf of British Petroleum. Among those accompanying him was Louis Malle who made a black-and-white film of the expedition for the company.[11] Cousteau won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1956 for The Silent World co-produced with Malle. In 1957, Cousteau took over as leader of the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco.[2] Afterward, with the assistance of Jean Mollard, he made a \"diving saucer\" SP-350, an experimental underwater vehicle which could reach a depth of 350 meters. The successful experiment was quickly repeated in 1965 with two vehicles which reached 500 meters./nIn 1957, he was elected as director of the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco.[2] He directed Pr\u00e9continent, about the experiments of diving in saturation (long-duration immersion, houses under the sea), and was admitted to the United States National Academy of Sciences./nHe was involved in the creation of Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Mondiale des Activit\u00e9s Subaquatiques and served as its inaugural president from 1959 to 1973.[12]/nCousteau also took part in inventing the \"SP-350 Denise Diving Saucer\" in 1959 which was an invention best for exploring the ocean floor, as it allowed one to explore on solid ground.[2]/nIn October 1960, a large amount of radioactive waste was going to be discarded in the Mediterranean Sea by the Commissariat \u00e0 l'\u00e9nergie atomique (CEA). The CEA argued that the dumps were experimental in nature, and that French oceanographers such as Vsevelod Romanovsky had recommended it. Romanovsky and other French scientists, including Louis Fage and Jacques Cousteau, repudiated the claim, saying that Romanovsky had in mind a much smaller amount. The CEA claimed that there was little circulation (and hence little need for concern) at the dump site between Nice and Corsica, but French public opinion sided with the oceanographers rather than with the CEA atomic energy scientists. The CEA chief, Francis Perrin, decided to postpone the dump.[13] Cousteau organized a publicity campaign which in less than two weeks gained wide popular support. The train carrying the waste was stopped by women and children sitting on the railway tracks, and it was sent back to its origin./nIn the 1960s, Cousteau was involved with a set of three projects to build underwater \"villages\"; the projects were named Precontinent I, Precontinent II and Precontinent III. Each ensuing project was aimed at increasing the depth at which people continuously lived under water, and were an attempt at creating an environment in which men could live and work on the sea floor. The projects are best known as Conshelf I (1962), Conshelf II (1963), and Conshelf III (1965). The names \"Precontinent\", and \"Continental Shelf Station\" (Conshelf) were used interchangeably by Cousteau./nA meeting with American television companies (ABC, M\u00e9trom\u00e9dia, NBC) created the series The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau, with the character of the commander in the red bonnet inherited from standard diving dress intended to give the films a \"personalized adventure\" style. This documentary television series ran for ten years from 1966 to 1976. A second documentary series, The Cousteau Odyssey, ran from 1977 to 1982 on public television stations./nIn 1970, he wrote the book The Shark: Splendid Savage of the Sea with his son Philippe.

Cousteau was deeply affected. He called his eldest son, the architect Jean-Michel, to his side. This collaboration lasted 14 years./nFrom 1980 to 1981, he was a regular on the animal reality show Those Amazing Animals, along with Burgess Meredith, Priscilla Presley, and Jim Stafford./nIn 1980, Cousteau traveled to Canada to make two films on the Saint Lawrence River and the Great Lakes, Cries from the Deep and St. Lawrence: Stairway to the Sea.[16]/nIn 1985, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from U.S. President Ronald Reagan./nFrom 1986 to 1992, Cousteau released Rediscovery of the World./nOn 24 November 1988, he was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, chair 17, succeeding Jean Delay. His official reception under the cupola took place on 22 June 1989, the response to his speech of reception being given by Bertrand Poirot-Delpech. After his death, he was replaced by \u00c9rik Orsenna on 28 May 1998./nIn June 1990, the composer Jean Michel Jarre paid homage to the commander by entitling his new album Waiting for Cousteau. He also composed the music for Cousteau's documentary \"Palawan, the last refuge\"./nOn 2 December 1990, his wife, Simone Cousteau died of cancer./nIn June 1991, in Paris, Jacques-Yves Cousteau remarried, to Francine Triplet, with whom he had (before this marriage) two children, Diane and Pierre-Yves. Francine Cousteau currently continues her husband's work as the head of the Cousteau Foundation and Cousteau Society. From that point, the relations between Jacques-Yves and his elder son, who is 8 years older than Francine, worsened./nIn November 1991, Cousteau gave an interview to the UNESCO Courier, in which he stated that he was in favour of human population control and population decrease. Widely quoted on the Internet are these two paragraphs from the interview: \"What should we do to eliminate suffering and disease? It's a wonderful idea but perhaps not altogether a beneficial one in the long run. If we try to implement it we may jeopardize the future of our species...It's terrible to have to say this. World population must be stabilized and to do that we must eliminate 350,000 people per day. This is so horrible to contemplate that we shouldn't even say it. But the general situation in which we are involved is lamentable\".[17]/nIn 1992, he was invited to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for the United Nations' International Conference on Environment and Development, and then he became a regular consultant for the UN and the World Bank./nIn 1993, a brief biography, as well as an introduction by Cousteau was featured in interactive educational software program Undersea Adventure, developed by former game developer Knowledge Adventure./nIn 1995, Cousteau became involved in a legal battle with his son Jean-Michel, who was advertising the \"Cousteau Fiji Islands Resort\" in the South Pacific, to prevent him from using the Cousteau name for business purposes in the United States.[18] This resulted in Jean-Michel Cousteau being ordered by the court to not encourage confusion between his for-profit business and his father's non-profit endeavours./nOn 11 January 1996, Calypso was accidentally rammed and sunk in the port of Singapore by a barge. The Calypso was refloated and towed home to France.[19]/nArchbishop Jean-Marie Lustiger celebrated his funeral Mass at Notre-Dame in Paris. In his homily he stated, \"Without betraying any confidences, Father Carr\u00e9 told me of his respect for Jacques-Yves Cousteau. He discovered in him a man of prayer whom he accompanied in his last months of his life, giving him, through the sacraments of the Church, the strength of his passage towards eternity.\"[20]/nIn a chapter entitled \"The Holy Scriptures and the Environment\" in the posthumous work The Human, the Orchid, and the Octopus, he is quoted as stating that \"The glory of nature provides evidence that God exists\".[21]/nCousteau said that just because fish are cold-blooded does not mean they do not feel pain, and that recreational fishermen only say so to reassure their conscience.[22]/nJacques-Yves Cousteau died of a heart attack on 25 June 1997 in Paris, two weeks after his 87th birthday. He was buried in the family vault at Saint-Andr\u00e9-de-Cubzac, his birthplace.[23] An homage was paid to him by the town by naming the street which runs out to the house of his birth \"rue du Commandant Cousteau\", where a commemorative plaque was placed./nCousteau's legacy includes more than 120 television documentaries, more than 50 books, and an environmental protection foundation with 300,000 members.[1]/nCousteau liked to call himself an \"oceanographic technician\". He was, in reality, a sophisticated showman, teacher, and lover of nature. His work permitted many people to explore the resources of the oceans./nHis work also created a new kind of scientific communication, criticized at the time by some academics. The so-called \"divulgationism\", a simple way of sharing scientific concepts, was soon employed in other disciplines and became one of the most important characteristics of modern television broadcasting./nHis Oceanographic Museum in Monaco, and perhaps even he himself,[24][25] has been identified as introducing the \"Killer Algae\" Caulerpa taxifolia, which is negatively affecting the Mediterranean's ecosystem./nThe Cousteau Society and its French counterpart, l'\u00c9quipe Cousteau, both of which Jacques-Yves Cousteau founded, are still active today. The Society is currently attempting to turn the original Calypso into a museum and it is raising funds to build a successor vessel, the Calypso II./nIn 2007, the International Watch Company introduced the IWC Aquatimer Chronograph \"Cousteau Divers\" Special Edition. The timepiece incorporated a sliver of wood from the interior of Cousteau's Calypso research vessel. Having developed the diver's watch, IWC offered support to The Cousteau Society. The proceeds from the timepieces' sales were partially donated to the non-profit organization involved in conservation of marine life and preservation of tropical coral reefs.[26]/nFabien Cousteau, the grandson of Jacques Cousteau, is in the process of constructing a community of ocean flooring analysis stations, called Proteus, off Cura\u00e7ao at a depth of about 20 m in a marine-protected area. Aquanauts could reside and work in these underwater habitats.

From 2020 to 2021 he served as president of the Society for Freshwater Science.[1]/nRam\u00edrez grew up in Costa Rica and has stated that even as a child, he was \"fascinated\" with dragonflies.[2] He attended the National University of Costa Rica as an undergraduate, performing research in stream ecology and writing a thesis about dragonfly nymphs.[2] Ram\u00edrez conducted ecological fieldwork at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, including during graduate school as a masters and doctoral student working with Catherine Pringle.[3] Papers from his graduate research on macroinvertebrate community structure[4] and decomposition[5] in Costa Rican streams have each been cited over 150 times by other scientists. At the same time as he was conducting this work, he published a taxonomic checklist of Odonate species in Costa Rica with two colleagues.[6]/nRam\u00edrez was hired as an assistant professor at the University of Puerto Rico in 2001; in 2018, he moved to North Carolina State University.[2] He also served as Director of the El Verde Field Station for 15 years.[2] Ram\u00edrez's research focuses on freshwater invertebrates, particularly in natural and urban tropical streams in Puerto Rico,[7] Costa Rica,[5] Mexico,[8] and elsewhere. He is a leading voice in the discussion of tropical streams ecology.[9][10] He has also continued his work on the taxonomy, morphology, and traits of freshwater macroinvertebrates, broadening the scope of this work from dragonflies in Costa Rica to aquatic insects throughout Latin America.[11]/nRam\u00edrez has continued some collaboration with colleagues from the University of Georgia, including Pringle, Amy Rosemond, and Judy Meyer. For example, together they published research combining observational and experimental laboratory and field approaches to show that natural gradients in phosphorus availability alter organic matter decomposition by microbial communities in tropical streams. Ram\u00edrez has also contributed to globally coordinated efforts to understand the drivers of organic matter decomposition across biomes.[12][13]/nMuch of Ram\u00edrez's work focuses on the effects of urbanization, disturbance, and extreme weather events on tropical stream community structure and function. Ram\u00edrez and his colleagues showed that urbanization depletes macroinvertebrate diversity in tropical streams, leading to reduced rates of organic matter decomposition.[7] After a severe drought in 2015, Ram\u00edrez and colleagues showed that streams in Luquillo Experimental Forest underwent drying and became intermittent, leading to anoxic conditions and altering invertebrate communities.[14] After Hurricane Maria in 2017, R and colleagues found that Puerto Rico's native fish were unaffected by flooding, while non-native fish were washed away or killed by debris.[15]/nRam\u00edrez founded a network of Latin American freshwater scientists, Macrolatinos@, in 2012.[2] Before being elected the President of the Society for Freshwater Science, Ram\u00edrez had served the society in multiple other roles, including on its Graduate Resources Committee, its International Coordination Committee, and its Latin American chapter.[2] He is also a member of the editorial board of the journals Freshwater Science[16] and Neotropical Biodiversity.[17]", "24592260": "Thomas Alvin Wehr is an American psychiatrist, research scientist, and author. He is a scientist emeritus and former chief of the Clinical Psychobiology branch of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)./nWehr received his degree in medicine from the University of Louisville School of Medicine in 1969. He subsequently completed his psychiatric residency at Yale School of Medicine and an internship at Michael Reese Hospital./nIn a 1990s study on photoperiodicity in humans,[1] Wehr placed a group of volunteers in an environment in which it was dark for 14 hours each day for a month. The subjects were able to sleep as much as they wanted during the experiment. On the first night, the subjects slept an average of 11 hours a night. This was concluded to be probably repaying a chronic sleep debt. By the fourth week, the subjects slept an average of eight hours a night\u00a0\u2013 but in two separate blocks. First, subjects tended to lie awake for one to two hours and then fall quickly asleep. The onset of sleep was linked to a spike in the hormone melatonin, whose secretion by the brain's pineal gland is triggered by darkness. After an average of three to five hours of sleep, the subjects would awaken and spend an hour or two in quiet wakefulness before a second three- to five-hour sleep period. It was thus suggested that such a biphasic pattern of sleep is the natural or pre-historic tendency for humans. No research into the sleeping patterns in natural environments of primates closely related to humans was cited for comparison./nWehr and colleague Norman E. Rosenthal are credited with identifying and describing Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) and developing light therapy to treat it.[2]/nWehr and colleague Anna Wirz-Justice were awarded the Anna Monika Prize for their work in the chronobiology of depressive illness.

He has been called \"The father of English botany.\"[2] He studied medicine in Italy, and was a friend of the great Swiss naturalist, Conrad Gessner. He was an early herbalist and ornithologist, and it is in these fields that the most interest lies today.[3] He is known as being one of the first \"parson-naturalists\" in England.[4]/nHe first published Libellus de Re herbaria in Latin in 1538, and later translated it into English because he believed herbalists were not sharing their knowledge. Turner's works were condemned under Henry VIII and under Mary Tudor.[2]/nTurner was born in Morpeth, Northumberland, in or around 1508. His father was probably a tanner of the same name. He studied at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge University, from 1526 to 1533, where he received his B.A. in 1530 and his M.A. in 1533.[5] He was a Fellow and Senior Treasurer of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge. While at Cambridge he published several works, including Libellus de re herbaria, in 1538. He spent much of his leisure in the careful study of plants which he sought for in their native habitat, and described with an accuracy hitherto unknown in England./nIn 1540, he began travelling about preaching until he was arrested. After his release, he went on to study medicine in Italy, at Ferrara and Bologna, from 1540 to 1542 and was incorporated M.D. at one of these universities.  He married Jane Auder[6] (perhaps a widow of a Mr Cage when they married[citation needed]) who gave birth to a son Peter in 1542. After his death, she remarried Richard Cox, Bishop of Ely.[7]/nAfter completing his medical degree, he became physician to the Earl of Emden. Back in England, he became chaplain and physician to the Duke of Somerset, and through Somerset's influence, he obtained ecclesiastical preferment. The position as Somerset's physician also led to practice among upper society. He was prebendary of Botevant in York Cathedral in 1550, and Dean of Wells Cathedral from 1551 to 1553, where he established a herbal garden.[8] When Mary I of England acceded to the throne, Turner went into exile once again. From 1553 to 1558, he lived in Wei\u00dfenburg in Bayern and supported himself as a physician. He became a Calvinist at this time, if not before./nAfter the succession of Elizabeth I of England in 1558, Turner returned to England, and was once again Dean of Wells Cathedral from 1560 to 1564. His attempts to bring the English church into an agreement with the reformed churches of Germany and Switzerland led to his suspension for nonconformity in 1564. Turner died in London on 7 July 1568 at his home in Crutched Friars, in the City of London, and is buried in the church of St Olave Hart Street. An engraved stone on the southeast wall of this church commemorates Turner. Thomas Lever, one of the great puritan preachers of the period, delivered the sermon at his funeral./nQuite early in his career, Turner became interested in natural history and set out to produce reliable lists of English plants and animals, which he published as Libellus de re herbaria in 1538. In 1544, Turner published Avium praecipuarum, quarum apud Plinium et Aristotelem mentio est, brevis et succincta historia (\"The Principal Birds of Aristotle and Pliny...\"), which not only discussed the principal birds and bird names mentioned by Aristotle and Pliny the Elder but also added accurate descriptions and life histories of birds from his own extensive ornithological knowledge. This is the first printed book devoted entirely to birds.[9]/nIn 1545, Turner published The Rescuynge of the Romishe Fox, and in 1548, The Names of Herbes. In 1551, he published the first of three parts of his famous Herbal, on which his botanical fame rests./nA new herball, wherin are conteyned the names of herbes\u2026 (London: imprinted by Steven Myerdman and soolde by John Gybken, 1551) is the first part of Turner's great work; the second was published in 1562 and the third in 1568, both by Arnold Birckman of Cologne. These volumes gave the first clear, systematic survey of English plants, and with their admirable woodcuts (mainly copied from Leonhart Fuchs's 1542 De Historia Stirpium Commentarii Insignes) and detailed observations based on Turner's own field studies put the herbal on an altogether higher footing than in earlier works. At the same time, however, Turner included an account of their \"uses and vertues\", and in his preface admits that some will accuse him of divulging to the general public what should have been reserved for a professional audience. For the first time, herbal was available in England in the vernacular, from which people could identify the main English plants without difficulty./nA New Book of Spiritual Physick was published in 1555. In 1562, Turner published the second part of his Herbal, dedicated to Sir Thomas Wentworth, son of the patron who had enabled him to go to Cambridge. This book was published by Arnold Birckman of Cologne, and included in the same binding Turner's treatise on baths. The second volume includes one of the earliest reference to the celebrated Glastonbury Thorn, only five miles from Wells, which Turner tells us \"is grene all the wynter, as all they that dwell there about do stedfastly holde\"[10].  The third and last part of Turner's Herbal was published in 1568, in a volume that also contained revised editions of the first and second parts. This was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth. He claimed that the herbal described only English plant species \"whereof is no mention made neither of ye old Grecianes nor Latines\".[11] A New Boke on the Natures and Properties of all Wines, also published in 1568, had pharmacological intent behind it, as also the included Treatise of Triacle./nAs a member of the nonconformist faction in the Vestments controversy Turner was famous for making an adulterer do public penance wearing a square cap and for teaching his dog to steal such caps from bishop's heads. His scholarly pursuits had other, distinctly political, implications. According to Tudor historian Lacey Baldwin Smith, for instance, \"Religious discontent and civil rebellion were obviously walking hand in hand when William Turner dared speak out against [Henry VIII's] proclamation of 1543 limiting the reading of the Bible to men of social standing. What kind of ungodly belly wisdom was it, he demanded, to say that 'rich men and the nobles are wiser than the poor people?'\"[12]/nTurner embraced the transmutation of species.

She focused on what caused cancer and what drugs could be used to fight it, establishing a monkey colony which resulted in her being able to grow tumors in tissue culture and looking at about 3000 chemicals to find a few that might work as cancer treatments.[4] Her studies with laboratory animals showed that sulfhydryl compounds may protect against toxicity from x-irradiation and alkylating agents by a distribution pattern which causes more of a protective compound to accumulate in the sensitive tissues than in the tumor. She also demonstrated that newborn mice are as sensitive to chemical carcinogens as they are to viral carcinogens.[1]/nIn her final studies, Kelly established one of the first rhesus monkey breeding colonies in this area for the study of carcinogenicity in primates.

Until 1998 he advised students and faculty in the University of Arizona's department of microbiology and immunology.[4]/nHe and his wife had three daughters and a son. He was predeceased by his wife and two of his daughters. Upon his death he was survived by one daughter, one son and five grandchildren.[4]", "5521310": "Michael Abercrombie FRS[1] (14 August 1912 \u2013 28 May 1979) was a British cell biologist and embryologist. He was one of four children of the poet Lascelles Abercrombie./nMichael was born at Ryton near Dymock in Gloucestershire on 14 August 1912, the third son of Lascelles Abercrombie, poet and critic, and his wife, Catherine, daughter of Owen Gwatkin, a surgeon at Grange-over-Sands.[2] His uncle was the famed British town planner, Patrick Abercrombie./nAbercrombie went to school at Liverpool College and then Leeds Grammar School. In 1931 he entered Queen's College, University of Oxford, to study Zoology under Professor Gavin de Beer, supported by a Hastings scholarship. He was awarded a first class B. Sc. degree in 1934./nHe moved to the Strangeways Research Laboratory at the University of Cambridge to undertake doctoral research.[3]  In 1938 was employed at University of Birmingham as a lecturer, while also holding a research fellowship at Queen's College, University of Oxford. At Birmingham he met another lecturer, Minnie Johnson, whom he married on 17 July 1939. He was classified as unfit for military service in the second world war and moved to University of Oxford to work on wound healing and nerve regeneration until 1943, then returned to Birmingham./nIn 1947 he and his wife moved to the anatomy and zoology departments at University College London.[4]  He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1958. He finally became director of the Strangeways Research Laboratory at Cambridge from 1970 until his death. Here Abercrombie studied cell population growth and behaviour./nHe notably discovered that animal cells moving through tissue culture will halt when they come into contact with another cell of the same type, with the important exception of cancer cells. This discovery led to new interest and research into the dynamics and growth of cancer cells./nHe was also involved in popularising science. Particularly successful projects were the co-authored Penguin Dictionary of Biology in 1951 (with co-author C. J. Hickman and others, reaching 11th edition in 2004) and the Penguin New Biology series (1945 - 1960), co-edited with his wife (writing as M. L. Johnson), and from 1953 with botanist Gordon Elliott Fogg. They also wrote articles for New Biology.[4]/nHe died at home in Cambridge on 28 May 1979./nHe married Minnie Louie (\"Jane\") Johnson in 1939. Together they had one son, Nicholas Abercrombie who became a noted sociologist.", "16289": "James Dewey Watson (born April 6, 1928) is an American molecular biologist, geneticist, and zoologist. In 1953, he co-authored with Francis Crick the academic paper proposing the double helix structure of the DNA molecule. Watson, Crick and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material\"./nWatson earned degrees at the University of Chicago (BS, 1947) and Indiana University (PhD, 1950). Following a post-doctoral year at the University of Copenhagen with Herman Kalckar and Ole Maal\u00f8e, Watson worked at the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory in England, where he first met his future collaborator Francis Crick. From 1956 to 1976, Watson was on the faculty of the Harvard University Biology Department, promoting research in molecular biology./nFrom 1968, Watson served as director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL), greatly expanding its level of funding and research. At CSHL, he shifted his research emphasis to the study of cancer, along with making it a world-leading research center in molecular biology. In 1994, he started as president and served for 10 years. He was then appointed chancellor, serving until he resigned in 2007 after making comments claiming that there is a genetic link between intelligence and race. In 2019, following the broadcast of a documentary in which Watson reiterated these views on race and genetics, CSHL revoked his honorary titles and severed all ties with him./nWatson has written many science books, including the textbook Molecular Biology of the Gene (1965) and his bestselling book The Double Helix (1968). Between 1988 and 1992, Watson was associated with the National Institutes of Health, helping to establish the Human Genome Project, which completed the task of mapping the human genome in 2003./nWatson was born in Chicago on April 6, 1928, as the only son of Jean (n\u00e9e Mitchell) and James D. Watson, a businessman descended mostly from colonial English immigrants to America.[11] His mother's father, Lauchlin Mitchell, a tailor, was from Glasgow, Scotland, and her mother, Lizzie Gleason, was the child of parents from County Tipperary, Ireland.[12] Raised Catholic, he later described himself as \"an escapee from the Catholic religion\".[13] Watson said, \"The luckiest thing that ever happened to me was that my father didn't believe in God.\"[14]/nWatson grew up on the South Side of Chicago and attended public schools, including Horace Mann Elementary School and South Shore High School.[11][15] He was fascinated with bird watching, a hobby shared with his father,[16] so he considered majoring in ornithology.[17] Watson appeared on Quiz Kids, a popular radio show that challenged bright youngsters to answer questions.[18] Thanks to the liberal policy of university president Robert Hutchins, he enrolled at the University of Chicago, where he was awarded a tuition scholarship, at the age of 15.[11][17][19] Among his professors was Louis Leon Thurstone from whom Watson learned about factor analysis, which he would later reference on his controversial views on race.[20]/nAfter reading Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger's book, What Is Life? in 1946, Watson changed his professional ambitions from the study of ornithology to genetics.[21] Watson earned his BS degree in zoology from the University of Chicago in 1947.[17] In his autobiography, Avoid Boring People, Watson described the University of Chicago as an \"idyllic academic institution where he was instilled with the capacity for critical thought and an ethical compulsion not to suffer fools who impeded his search for truth\", in contrast to his description of later experiences. In 1947 Watson left the University of Chicago to become a graduate student at Indiana University, attracted by the presence at Bloomington of the 1946 Nobel Prize winner Hermann Joseph Muller, who in crucial papers published in 1922, 1929, and in the 1930s had laid out all the basic properties of the heredity molecule that Schr\u00f6dinger presented in his 1944 book.[22] He received his PhD degree from Indiana University in 1950; Salvador Luria was his doctoral advisor.[17][23]/nOriginally, Watson was drawn into molecular biology by the work of Salvador Luria. Luria eventually shared the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on the Luria\u2013Delbr\u00fcck experiment, which concerned the nature of genetic mutations. He was part of a distributed group of researchers who were making use of the viruses that infect bacteria, called bacteriophages. He and Max Delbr\u00fcck were among the leaders of this new \"Phage Group\", an important movement of geneticists from experimental systems such as Drosophila towards microbial genetics. Early in 1948, Watson began his PhD research in Luria's laboratory at Indiana University.[23] That spring, he met Delbr\u00fcck first in Luria's apartment and again that summer during Watson's first trip to the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL).[24][25]/nThe Phage Group was the intellectual medium where Watson became a working scientist. Importantly, the members of the Phage Group sensed that they were on the path to discovering the physical nature of the gene. In 1949, Watson took a course with Felix Haurowitz that included the conventional view of that time: that genes were proteins and able to replicate themselves.[26] The other major molecular component of chromosomes, DNA, was widely considered to be a \"stupid tetranucleotide\", serving only a structural role to support the proteins.[27] Even at this early time, Watson, under the influence of the Phage Group, was aware of the Avery\u2013MacLeod\u2013McCarty experiment, which suggested that DNA was the genetic molecule. Watson's research project involved using X-rays to inactivate bacterial viruses.[28]/nWatson then went to Copenhagen University in September 1950 for a year of postdoctoral research, first heading to the laboratory of biochemist Herman Kalckar.[11] Kalckar was interested in the enzymatic synthesis of nucleic acids, and he wanted to use phages as an experimental system. Watson wanted to explore the structure of DNA, and his interests did not coincide with Kalckar's.[29] After working part of the year with Kalckar, Watson spent the remainder of his time in Copenhagen conducting experiments with microbial physiologist Ole Maal\u00f8e, then a member of the Phage Group.[30]/nThe experiments, which Watson had learned of during the previous summer's Cold Spring Harbor phage conference, included the use of radioactive phosphate as a tracer to determine which molecular components of phage particles actually infect the target bacteria during viral infection.[29] The intention was to determine whether protein or DNA was the genetic material, but upon consultation with Max Delbr\u00fcck,[29] they determined that their results were inconclusive and could not specifically identify the newly labeled molecules as DNA.[31] Watson never developed a constructive interaction with Kalckar, but he did accompany Kalckar to a meeting in Italy, where Watson saw Maurice Wilkins talk about X-ray diffraction data for DNA.[11] Watson was now certain that DNA had a definite molecular structure that could be elucidated.[32]/nIn 1951, the chemist Linus Pauling in California published his model of the amino acid alpha helix, a result that grew out of Pauling's efforts in X-ray crystallography and molecular model building. After obtaining some results from his phage and other experimental research[33] conducted at Indiana University, Statens Serum Institut (Denmark), CSHL, and the California Institute of Technology, Watson now had the desire to learn to perform X-ray diffraction experiments so he could work to determine the structure of DNA. That summer, Luria met John Kendrew,[34] and he arranged for a new postdoctoral research project for Watson in England.[11] In 1951 Watson visited the Stazione Zoologica 'Anton Dohrn' in Naples.[35]/nIn mid-March 1953, Watson and Crick deduced the double helix structure of DNA.[11] Crucial to their discovery were the experimental data collected at King's College London\u2014mainly by Rosalind Franklin for which they did not provide proper attribution.[36][37] Sir Lawrence Bragg,[38] the director of the Cavendish Laboratory (where Watson and Crick worked), made the original announcement of the discovery at a Solvay conference on proteins in Belgium on April 8, 1953; it went unreported by the press. Watson and Crick submitted a paper entitled \"Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid\" to the scientific journal Nature, which was published on April 25, 1953.[39] Bragg gave a talk at the Guy's Hospital Medical School in London on Thursday, May 14, 1953, which resulted in a May 15, 1953, article by Ritchie Calder in the London newspaper News Chronicle, entitled \"Why You Are You. Nearer Secret of Life\"./nSydney Brenner, Jack Dunitz, Dorothy Hodgkin, Leslie Orgel, and Beryl M. Oughton were some of the first people in April 1953 to see the model of the structure of DNA, constructed by Crick and Watson; at the time, they were working at Oxford University's chemistry department. All were impressed by the new DNA model, especially Brenner, who subsequently worked with Crick at Cambridge in the Cavendish Laboratory and the new Laboratory of Molecular Biology. According to the late Beryl Oughton, later Rimmer, they all travelled together in two cars once Dorothy Hodgkin announced to them that they were off to Cambridge to see the model of the structure of DNA.[40]/nThe Cambridge University student newspaper Varsity also ran its own short article on the discovery on Saturday, May 30, 1953. Watson subsequently presented a paper on the double-helical structure of DNA at the 18th Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Viruses in early June 1953, six weeks after the publication of the Watson and Crick paper in Nature. Many at the meeting had not yet heard of the discovery. The 1953 Cold Spring Harbor Symposium was the first opportunity for many to see the model of the DNA double helix./nWatson, Crick, and Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 for their research on the structure of nucleic acids.[11][41][42] Rosalind Franklin had died in 1958 and was therefore ineligible for nomination.[36]/nThe publication of the double helix structure of DNA has been described as a turning point in science; understanding of life was fundamentally changed and the modern era of biology began.[43]/nWatson and Crick's use of DNA X-ray diffraction data collected by Rosalind Franklin and her student Raymond Gosling has attracted scrutiny. It has been argued that Watson and his colleagues did not properly acknowledge colleague Rosalind Franklin for her contributions to the discovery of the double helix structure.[37][44] Robert P. Crease notes that \"Such stingy behaviour may not be unknown, or even uncommon, among scientists\".[45] Franklin's high-quality X-ray diffraction patterns of DNA were unpublished results, which Watson and Crick used without her knowledge or consent in their construction of the double helix model of DNA.[44][36][46] Franklin's results provided estimates of the water content of DNA crystals and these results were consistent with the two sugar-phosphate backbones being on the outside of the molecule. Franklin told Crick and Watson that the backbones had to be on the outside; before then, Linus Pauling and Watson and Crick had erroneous models with the chains inside and the bases pointing outwards.[22] Her identification of the space group for DNA crystals revealed to Crick that the two DNA strands were antiparallel./nThe X-ray diffraction images collected by Gosling and Franklin provided the best evidence for the helical nature of DNA. Watson and Crick had three sources for Franklin's unpublished data:/nIn a 1954 article, Watson and Crick acknowledged that, without Franklin's data, \"the formulation of our structure would have been most unlikely, if not impossible\".[50] In The Double Helix, Watson later admitted that \"Rosy, of course, did not directly give us her data. For that matter, no one at King's realized they were in our hands\". In recent years, Watson has garnered controversy in the popular and scientific press for his \"misogynist treatment\" of Franklin and his failure to properly attribute her work on DNA.[37] According to one critic, Watson's portrayal of Franklin in The Double Helix was negative, giving the impression that she was Wilkins' assistant and was unable to interpret her own DNA data.[51] Watson's accusation was indefensible since Franklin told Crick and Watson that the helix backbones had to be on the outside.[22] From a 2003 piece by Brenda Maddox in Nature:[37]/nOther comments dismissive of \"Rosy\" in Watson's book caught the attention of the emerging women's movement in the late 1960s. \"Clearly Rosy had to go or be put in her place ... Unfortunately Maurice could not see any decent way to give Rosy the boot\". And, \"Certainly a bad way to go out into the foulness of a ... November night was to be told by a woman to refrain from venturing an opinion about a subject for which you were not trained.\"/nRobert P. Crease remarks that \"[Franklin] was close to figuring out the structure of DNA, but did not do it. The title of \"discoverer\" goes to those who first fit the pieces together\".[45] Jeremy Bernstein rejects that Franklin was a \"victim\" and states that \"[Watson and Crick] made the double-helix scheme work. It is as simple as that\".[45] Matthew Cobb and Nathaniel C. Comfort write that \"Franklin was no victim in how the DNA double helix was solved\" but that she was \"an equal contributor to the solution of the structure\".[50]/nA review of the correspondence from Franklin to Watson, in the archives at CSHL, revealed that the two scientists later exchanged constructive scientific correspondence. Franklin consulted with Watson on her tobacco mosaic virus RNA research. Franklin's letters were framed with the normal and unremarkable forms of address, beginning with \"Dear Jim\", and concluding with \"Best Wishes, Yours, Rosalind\". Each of the scientists published their own unique contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA in separate articles, and all of the contributors published their findings in the same volume of Nature. These classic molecular biology papers are identified as: Watson J. D. and Crick F. H. C. \"A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid\". Nature 171, 737\u2013738 (1953);[39] Wilkins M. H. F., Stokes A. R. & Wilson H. R. \"Molecular Structure of Deoxypentose Nucleic Acids\". Nature 171, 738\u2013740 (1953);[52] Franklin R. and Gosling R. G. \"Molecular Configuration in Sodium Thymonucleate\". Nature 171, 740\u2013741 (1953).[53]/nIn 1956, Watson accepted a position in the biology department at Harvard University. His work at Harvard focused on RNA and its role in the transfer of genetic information.[54]/nWatson championed a switch in focus for the school from classical biology to molecular biology, stating that disciplines such as ecology, developmental biology, taxonomy, physiology, etc. had stagnated and could progress only once the underlying disciplines of molecular biology and biochemistry had elucidated their underpinnings, going so far as to discourage their study by students./nWatson continued to be a member of the Harvard faculty until 1976, even though he took over the directorship of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1968.[54]/nDuring his tenure at Harvard, Watson participated in a protest against the Vietnam War, leading a group of 12 biologists and biochemists calling for \"the immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam\".[55] In 1975, on the thirtieth anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima, Watson was one of over 2000 scientists and engineers who spoke out against nuclear proliferation to President Gerald Ford, arguing that there was no proven method for the safe disposal of radioactive waste, and that nuclear plants were a security threat due to the possibility of terrorist theft of plutonium.[56]/nWatson's first textbook, The Molecular Biology of the Gene, used the concept of heads\u2014brief declarative subheadings.[57] His next textbook was Molecular Biology of the Cell, in which he coordinated the work of a group of scientist-writers. His third was Recombinant DNA, which described the ways in which genetic engineering has brought new information about how organisms function./nIn 1968, Watson wrote The Double Helix,[58] listed by the board of the Modern Library as number seven in their list of 100 Best Nonfiction books.[59] The book details the story of the discovery of the structure of DNA, as well as the personalities, conflicts and controversy surrounding their work, and includes many of his private emotional impressions at the time. Watson's original title was to have been \"Honest Jim\".[60] Controversy surrounded the publication of the book. Watson's book was originally to be published by the Harvard University Press, but Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins, among others, objected. Watson's home university dropped the project and the book was commercially published.[61][62] In an interview with Anne Sayre for her book, Rosalind Franklin and DNA (published in 1975 and reissued in 2000), Francis Crick said that he regarded Watson's book as a \"contemptible pack of damned nonsense\".[63]/nIn 1968, Watson became the director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). Between 1970 and 1972, the Watsons' two sons were born, and by 1974, the young family made Cold Spring Harbor their permanent residence. Watson served as the laboratory's director and president for about 35 years, and later he assumed the role of chancellor and then chancellor emeritus./nIn his roles as director, president, and chancellor, Watson led CSHL to articulate its present-day mission, \"dedication to exploring molecular biology and genetics in order to advance the understanding and ability to diagnose and treat cancers, neurological diseases, and other causes of human suffering.\"[64] CSHL substantially expanded both its research and its science educational programs under Watson's direction. He is credited with \"transforming a small facility into one of the world's great education and research institutions. Initiating a program to study the cause of human cancer, scientists under his direction have made major contributions to understanding the genetic basis of cancer.\"[65] In a retrospective summary of Watson's accomplishments there, Bruce Stillman, the laboratory's president, said, \"Jim Watson created a research environment that is unparalleled in the world of science.\"[65]/nIn 2007, Watson said, \"I turned against the left wing because they don't like genetics, because genetics implies that sometimes in life we fail because we have bad genes. They want all failure in life to be due to the evil system.\"[66]/nIn 1990, Watson was appointed as the head of the Human Genome Project at the National Institutes of Health, a position he held until April 10, 1992.[67] Watson left the Genome Project after conflicts with the new NIH Director, Bernadine Healy. Watson was opposed to Healy's attempts to acquire patents on gene sequences, and any ownership of the \"laws of nature\". Two years before stepping down from the Genome Project, he had stated his own opinion on this long and ongoing controversy which he saw as an illogical barrier to research; he said, \"The nations of the world must see that the human genome belongs to the world's people, as opposed to its nations.\" He left within weeks of the 1992 announcement that the NIH would be applying for patents on brain-specific cDNAs.[68] (The issue of the patentability of genes has since been resolved in the US by the US Supreme Court; see Association for Molecular Pathology v. U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.)/nIn 1994, Watson became president of CSHL. Francis Collins took over the role as director of the Human Genome Project./nWatson was quoted in The Sunday Telegraph in 1997 as stating: \"If you could find the gene which determines sexuality and a woman decides she doesn't want a homosexual child, well, let her.\"[69] The biologist Richard Dawkins wrote a letter to The Independent claiming that Watson's position was misrepresented by The Sunday Telegraph article, and that Watson would equally consider the possibility of having a heterosexual child to be just as valid as any other reason for abortion, to emphasise that Watson is in favor of allowing choice.[70]/nOn the issue of obesity, Watson was quoted in 2000, saying: \"Whenever you interview fat people, you feel bad, because you know you're not going to hire them.\"[71]/nWatson has repeatedly supported genetic screening and genetic engineering in public lectures and interviews, arguing that stupidity is a disease and the \"really stupid\" bottom 10% of people should be cured.[72] He has also suggested that beauty could be genetically engineered, saying in 2003, \"People say it would be terrible if we made all girls pretty. I think it would be great.\"[72][73]/nIn 2007, Watson became the second person[74] to publish his fully sequenced genome online,[75] after it was presented to him on May 31, 2007, by 454 Life Sciences Corporation[76] in collaboration with scientists at the Human Genome Sequencing Center, Baylor College of Medicine. Watson was quoted as saying, \"I am putting my genome sequence on line to encourage the development of an era of personalized medicine, in which information contained in our genomes can be used to identify and prevent disease and to create individualized medical therapies\".[77][78][79]/nIn 2014, Watson published a paper in The Lancet suggesting that biological oxidants may have a different role than is thought in diseases including diabetes, dementia, heart disease and cancer. For example, type 2 diabetes is usually thought to be caused by oxidation in the body that causes inflammation and kills off pancreatic cells. Watson thinks the root of that inflammation is different: \"a lack of biological oxidants, not an excess\", and discusses this in detail. One critical response was that the idea was neither new nor worthy of merit, and that The Lancet published Watson's paper only because of his name.[80] Other scientists have expressed their support for his hypothesis and have proposed that it can also be expanded to why a lack of oxidants can result in cancer and its progression.[81]/nIn 2014, Watson sold his Nobel Prize medal to raise money after complaining of being made an \"unperson\" following controversial statements he had made.[82] Part of the funds raised by the sale went to support scientific research.[83] The medal sold at auction at Christie's in December 2014 for US$4.1 million. Watson intended to contribute the proceeds to conservation work in Long Island and to funding research at Trinity College, Dublin.[84][85] He was the first living Nobel recipient to auction a medal.[86] The medal was later returned to Watson by the purchaser, Alisher Usmanov.[87]/nSeveral of Watson's former doctoral students subsequently became notable in their own right including, Mario Capecchi,[4] Bob Horvitz, Peter B. Moore and Joan Steitz.[5] Besides numerous PhD students, Watson also supervised postdoctoral researchers and other interns including Ewan Birney,[6] Ronald W. Davis, Phillip Allen Sharp (postdoc), John Tooze (postdoc)[8][9] and Richard J. Roberts (postdoc).[7]/nWatson is a former member of the Board of Directors of United Biomedical, Inc., founded by Chang Yi Wang. He held the position for six years and retired from the board in 1999.[88]/nIn January 2007, Watson accepted the invitation of Leonor Beleza, president of the Champalimaud Foundation, to become the head of the foundation's scientific council, an advisory organ.[89][90]/nIn March 2017, Watson was named head consultant of the Cheerland Investment Group, a Chinese investment company which sponsored his trip.[citation needed]/nWatson has also been an institute adviser for the Allen Institute for Brain Science.[91][92]/nWatson has had disagreements with Craig Venter regarding his use of EST fragments while Venter worked at NIH. Venter went on to found Celera genomics and continued his feud with Watson. Watson was quoted as calling Venter \"Hitler\".[93]/nIn his 2007 memoir, Avoid Boring People: Lessons from a Life in Science, Watson describes his academic colleagues as \"dinosaurs\", \"deadbeats\", \"fossils\", \"has-beens\", \"mediocre\", and \"vapid\".[94] Steve Shapin in Harvard Magazine noted that Watson had written an unlikely \"Book of Manners\", telling about the skills needed at different times in a scientist's career; he wrote Watson was known for aggressively pursuing his own goals at the university. E. O. Wilson once described Watson as \"the most unpleasant human being I had ever met\", but in a later TV interview said that he considered them friends and their rivalry at Harvard \"old history\" (when they had competed for funding in their respective fields).[95][96]/nIn the epilogue to the memoir Avoid Boring People, Watson alternately attacks and defends former Harvard University president Lawrence Summers, who stepped down in 2006 due in part to his remarks about women and science.[97] Watson also states in the epilogue, \"Anyone sincerely interested in understanding the imbalance in the representation of men and women in science must reasonably be prepared at least to consider the extent to which nature may figure, even with the clear evidence that nurture is strongly implicated.\"[73][94]/nAt a conference in 2000, Watson suggested a link between skin color and sex drive, hypothesizing that dark-skinned people have stronger libidos.[71][98] His lecture argued that extracts of melanin\u2014which gives skin its color\u2014had been found to boost subjects' sex drive. \"That's why you have Latin lovers\", he said, according to people who attended the lecture. \"You've never heard of an English lover. Only an English Patient.\"[99] He has also said that stereotypes associated with racial and ethnic groups have a genetic basis: Jews being intelligent, Chinese being intelligent but not creative because of selection for conformity, and Indians being servile because of selection under caste endogamy.[100] Regarding intelligence differences between blacks and whites, Watson has asserted that \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their (blacks) intelligence is the same as ours (whites) \u2013 whereas all the testing says not really\u00a0... people who have to deal with black employees find this not true.\"[101]/nWatson has repeatedly asserted that differences in average measured IQ between blacks and whites are due to genetics.[102][103][104] In early October 2007, he was interviewed by Charlotte Hunt-Grubbe at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). He discussed his view that Africans are less intelligent than Westerners.[105][106][107] Watson said his intention was to promote science, not racism, but some UK venues canceled his appearances,[108] and he canceled the rest of his tour.[109][110][111][112] An editorial in Nature said that his remarks were \"beyond the pale\" but expressed a wish that the tour had not been canceled so that Watson would have had to face his critics in person, encouraging scientific discussion on the matter.[113] Because of the controversy, the board of trustees at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory suspended Watson's administrative responsibilities.[114] Watson issued an apology,[115] then retired at the age of 79 from CSHL from what the lab called \"nearly 40 years of distinguished service\".[65][116] Watson attributed his retirement to his age and to circumstances that he could never have anticipated or desired.[117][118][119]/nIn 2008, Watson was appointed chancellor emeritus of CSHL[120][121] but continued to advise and guide project work at the laboratory.[122] In a BBC documentary that year, Watson said he did not see himself as a racist.[123]/nIn January 2019, following the broadcast of a television documentary made the previous year in which he repeated his views about race and genetics, CSHL revoked honorary titles that it had awarded to Watson and cut all remaining ties with him.[124][125][126] Watson did not respond to the developments.[127]/nWatson is an atheist.[14][128] In 2003, he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto.[129]/nWatson married Elizabeth Lewis in 1968.[10] They have two sons, Rufus Robert Watson (b. 1970) and Duncan James Watson (b. 1972). Watson sometimes talks about his son Rufus, who has schizophrenia, seeking to encourage progress in the understanding and treatment of mental illness by determining how genetics contributes to it.[122]/nWatson has won numerous awards, including:/n\"All text published under the heading 'Biography' on Fellow profile pages is available under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\" --\"Royal Society Terms, conditions and policies\".

Bhalla is on the working group of Mothers in Science which works to evaluate scientific conference guidelines to address barriers facing parents.[3]/nBhalla has two sons.[3]", "49072": "Sir Francis Galton FRS FRAI (/\u02c8\u0261\u0254\u02d0lt\u0259n/; 16 February 1822\u00a0\u2013 17 January 1911) was a British polymath and the originator of the eugenics movement during the Victorian era.[1][2]/nGalton produced over 340 papers and books. He also developed the statistical concept of correlation and widely promoted regression toward the mean. He was the first to apply statistical methods to the study of human differences and inheritance of intelligence, and introduced the use of questionnaires and surveys for collecting data on human communities, which he needed for genealogical and biographical works and for his anthropometric studies. He coined the phrase \"nature versus nurture\".[3] His book Hereditary Genius (1869) was the first social scientific attempt to study genius and greatness.[4]/nAs an investigator of the human mind, he founded psychometrics and differential psychology, as well as the lexical hypothesis of personality. He devised a method for classifying fingerprints that proved useful in forensic science. He also conducted research on the power of prayer, concluding it had none due to its null effects on the longevity of those prayed for.[5] His quest for the scientific principles of diverse phenomena extended even to the optimal method for making tea.[6] As the initiator of scientific meteorology, he devised the first weather map, proposed a theory of anticyclones, and was the first to establish a complete record of short-term climatic phenomena on a European scale.[7] He also invented the Galton Whistle for testing differential hearing ability.[8] Galton was Charles Darwin's half-cousin.[9] Galton was knighted in 1909 for his contributions to science.[10] In recent years, he has received significant criticism for being a proponent of social Darwinism, eugenics, and scientific racism; he was a pioneer of eugenics, coining the term itself in 1883./nGalton was born at \"The Larches\", a large house in the Sparkbrook area of Birmingham, England, built on the site of \"Fair Hill\", the former home of Joseph Priestley, which the botanist William Withering had renamed. He was Charles Darwin's half-cousin, sharing the common grandparent Erasmus Darwin. His father was Samuel Tertius Galton, son of Samuel Galton Jr. He was also a cousin of Douglas Strutt Galton. The Galtons were Quaker gun-manufacturers and bankers, while the Darwins were involved in medicine and science./nBoth the Galton and Darwin families included Fellows of the Royal Society and members who loved to invent in their spare time. Both Erasmus Darwin and Samuel Galton were founding members of the Lunar Society of Birmingham, which included Matthew Boulton, James Watt, Josiah Wedgwood, Joseph Priestley and Richard Lovell Edgeworth. Both families were known for their literary talent. Erasmus Darwin composed lengthy technical treatises in verse. Galton's aunt Mary Anne Galton wrote on aesthetics and religion, and her autobiography detailed the environment of her childhood populated by Lunar Society members./nGalton was a child prodigy\u00a0\u2013 he was reading by the age of two; at age five he knew some Greek, Latin and long division, and by the age of six he had moved on to adult books, including Shakespeare for pleasure, and poetry, which he quoted at length.[11] Galton attended King Edward's School, Birmingham, but chafed at the narrow classical curriculum and left at 16.[12] His parents pressed him to enter the medical profession, and he studied for two years at Birmingham General Hospital and King's College London Medical School. He followed this up with mathematical studies at Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1840 to early 1844.[13]/nAccording to the records of the United Grand Lodge of England, it was in February 1844 that Galton became a freemason at the Scientific lodge, held at the Red Lion Inn in Cambridge, progressing through the three masonic degrees: Apprentice, 5 February 1844; Fellow Craft, 11 March 1844; Master Mason, 13 May 1844. A note in the record states: \"Francis Galton Trinity College student, gained his certificate 13 March 1845\".[14] One of Galton's masonic certificates from Scientific lodge can be found among his papers at University College, London.[15]/nA nervous breakdown prevented Galton's intent to try for honours. He elected instead to take a \"poll\" (pass) B.A. degree, like his half-cousin Charles Darwin.[16] (Following the Cambridge custom, he was awarded an M.A. without further study, in 1847.) He briefly resumed his medical studies but the death of his father in 1844 left him emotionally destitute, though financially independent,[citation needed] and he terminated his medical studies entirely, turning to foreign travel, sport and technical invention./nIn his early years Galton was an enthusiastic traveller, and made a solo trip through Eastern Europe to Istanbul, before going up to Cambridge. In 1845 and 1846, he went to Egypt and travelled up the Nile to Khartoum in the Sudan, and from there to Beirut, Damascus and down to Jordan./nIn 1850 he joined the Royal Geographical Society, and over the next two years mounted a long and difficult expedition into then little-known South West Africa (now Namibia). He wrote a book on his experience, Narrative of an Explorer in Tropical South Africa.[17] He was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's Founder's Medal in 1853 and the Silver Medal of the French Geographical Society for his pioneering cartographic survey of the region.[18] This established his reputation as a geographer and explorer. He proceeded to write the best-selling The Art of Travel, a handbook of practical advice for the Victorian on the move, which went through many editions and is still in print./nGalton was a polymath who made important contributions in many fields, including meteorology (the anticyclone and the first popular weather maps), statistics (regression and correlation), psychology (synaesthesia), biology (the nature and mechanism of heredity), and criminology (fingerprints). Much of this was influenced by his penchant for counting and measuring. Galton prepared the first weather map published in The Times (1 April 1875, showing the weather from the previous day, 31 March), now a standard feature in newspapers worldwide.[19]/nHe became very active in the British Association for the Advancement of Science, presenting many papers on a wide variety of topics at its meetings from 1858 to 1899.[20] He was the general secretary from 1863 to 1867, president of the Geographical section in 1867 and 1872, and president of the Anthropological Section in 1877 and 1885. He was active on the council of the Royal Geographical Society for over forty years, in various committees of the Royal Society, and on the Meteorological Council./nJames McKeen Cattell, a student of Wilhelm Wundt who had been reading Galton's articles, decided he wanted to study under him. He eventually built a professional relationship with Galton, measuring subjects and working together on research.[21]/nIn 1888, Galton established a lab in the science galleries of the South Kensington Museum. In Galton's lab, participants could be measured to gain knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses. Galton also used these data for his own research. He would typically charge people a small fee for his services.[22]/nIn 1873, Galton wrote a letter to The Times titled 'Africa for the Chinese', where he argued that the Chinese, as a race capable of high civilization and only temporarily stunted by the recent failures of Chinese dynasties, should be encouraged to immigrate to Africa and displace the inferior aboriginal blacks.[23]/nThe publication by his cousin Charles Darwin of The Origin of Species in 1859 was an event that changed Galton's life.[24] He came to be gripped by the work, especially the first chapter on \"Variation under Domestication\", concerning animal breeding./nGalton devoted much of the rest of his life to exploring variation in human populations and its implications, at which Darwin had only hinted in The Origin of Species, although he returned to it in his 1871 book The Descent of Man, drawing on his cousin's work in the intervening period. Galton established a research program which embraced multiple aspects of human variation, from mental characteristics to height; from facial images to fingerprint patterns. This required inventing novel measures of traits, devising large-scale collection of data using those measures, and in the end, the discovery of new statistical techniques for describing and understanding the data./nGalton was interested at first in the question of whether human ability was hereditary, and proposed to count the number of the relatives of various degrees of eminent men. If the qualities were hereditary, he reasoned, there should be more eminent men among the relatives than among the general population. To test this, he invented the methods of historiometry. Galton obtained extensive data from a broad range of biographical sources which he tabulated and compared in various ways. This pioneering work was described in detail in his book Hereditary Genius in 1869.[4] Here he showed, among other things, that the numbers of eminent relatives dropped off when going from the first degree to the second degree relatives, and from the second degree to the third. He took this as evidence of the inheritance of abilities./nGalton recognized the limitations of his methods in these two works, and believed the question could be better studied by comparisons of twins. His method envisaged testing to see if twins who were similar at birth diverged in dissimilar environments, and whether twins dissimilar at birth converged when reared in similar environments. He again used the method of questionnaires to gather various sorts of data, which were tabulated and described in a paper The history of twins in 1875. In so doing he anticipated the modern field of behaviour genetics, which relies heavily on twin studies. He concluded that the evidence favored nature rather than nurture. He also proposed adoption studies, including trans-racial adoption studies, to separate the effects of heredity and environment./nGalton recognized that cultural circumstances influenced the capability of a civilization's citizens, and their reproductive success. In Hereditary Genius, he envisaged a situation conducive to resilient and enduring civilization as follows:/nThe best form of civilization in respect to the improvement of the race, would be one in which society was not costly; where incomes were chiefly derived from professional sources, and not much through inheritance; where every lad had a chance of showing his abilities, and, if highly gifted, was enabled to achieve a first-class education and entrance into professional life, by the liberal help of the exhibitions and scholarships which he had gained in his early youth; where marriage was held in as high honor as in ancient Jewish times; where the pride of race was encouraged (of course I do not refer to the nonsensical sentiment of the present day, that goes under that name); where the weak could find a welcome and a refuge in celibate monasteries or sisterhoods, and lastly, where the better sort of emigrants and refugees from other lands were invited and welcomed, and their descendants naturalized./nGalton invented the term eugenics in 1883 and set down many of his observations and conclusions in a book, Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development. In the book's introduction, he wrote:/n[This book's] intention is to touch on various topics more or less connected with that of the cultivation of race, or, as we might call it, with \"eugenic\"1 questions, and to present the results of several of my own separate investigations.1 This is, with questions bearing on what is termed in Greek, eugenes, namely, good in stock, hereditarily endowed with noble qualities. This, and the allied words, eugeneia, etc., are equally applicable to men, brutes, and plants. We greatly want a brief word to express the science of improving stock, which is by no means confined to questions of judicious mating, but which, especially in the case of man, takes cognizance of all influences that tend in however remote a degree to give the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable than they otherwise would have had. The word eugenics would sufficiently express the idea; it is at least a neater word and a more generalized one than viriculture, which I once ventured to use./nHe believed that a scheme of 'marks' for family merit should be defined, and early marriage between families of high rank be encouraged via provision of monetary incentives. He pointed out some of the tendencies in British society, such as the late marriages of eminent people, and the paucity of their children, which he thought were dysgenic. He advocated encouraging eugenic marriages by supplying able couples with incentives to have children. On 29 October 1901, Galton chose to address eugenic issues when he delivered the second Huxley lecture at the Royal Anthropological Institute.[21]/nThe Eugenics Review, the journal of the Eugenics Education Society, commenced publication in 1909. Galton, the Honorary President of the society, wrote the foreword for the first volume.[21] The First International Congress of Eugenics was held in July 1912. Winston Churchill and Carls Elliot were among the attendees.[21]/nAccording to an editorial in Nature: \"Galton also constructed a racial hierarchy, in which white people were considered superior. He wrote that the average intellectual standard of the negro race is some two grades below our own (the Anglo Saxon).\"[25] According to the Encyclopedia of Genocide, Galton bordered on the justification of genocide when he stated: \"There exists a sentiment, for the most part quite unreasonable, against the gradual extinction of an inferior race.\"[26]/nIn June 2020, UCL announced the renaming of a lecture theatre named after Galton because of his connection with eugenics.[27]/nGalton's formulation of regression and its link to the bivariate normal distribution can be traced to his attempts at developing a mathematical model for population stability. Although Galton's first attempt to study Darwinian questions,  Hereditary Genius, generated little enthusiasm at the time, the text led to his further studies in the 1870s concerning the inheritance of physical traits.[28] This text contains some crude notions of the concept of regression, described in a qualitative matter. For example, he wrote of dogs: \"If a man breeds from strong, well-shaped dogs, but of mixed pedigree, the puppies will be sometimes, but rarely, the equals of their parents. They will commonly be of a mongrel, nondescript type, because ancestral peculiarities are apt to crop out in the offspring.\"[29]/nThis notion created a problem for Galton, as he could not reconcile the tendency of a population to maintain a normal distribution of traits from generation to generation with the notion of inheritance. It seemed that a large number of factors operated independently on offspring,  leading to the normal distribution of a trait in each generation. However, this provided no explanation as to how a parent can have a significant impact on his offspring, which was the basis of inheritance.[30]/nGalton's solution to this problem was presented in his Presidential Address at the September 1885 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, as he was serving at the time as President of Section H: Anthropology.[31] The address was published in Nature, and Galton further developed the theory in  \"Regression toward mediocrity in hereditary stature\" and \"Hereditary Stature.\"[32][33] An elaboration of this theory was published in 1889 in Natural Inheritance. There were three key developments that helped Galton develop this theory: the  development of the law of error in 1874\u20131875, the formulation of an empirical law of reversion in 1877, and the development of a mathematical framework encompassing regression using human population data during 1885.[30]/nGalton's development of the law of regression to the mean, or reversion, was due to insights from the Galton board ('bean machine') and his studies of sweet peas. While Galton had previously invented the quincunx prior to February 1874, the 1877 version of the quincunx had a new feature that helped Galton demonstrate that a normal mixture of normal distributions is also normal.[34] Galton demonstrated this using a new version of quincunx, adding chutes to the apparatus to represent reversion. When the pellets passed through the curved chutes (representing reversion) and then the pins (representing family variability), the result was a stable population. On Friday 19 February 1877 Galton gave a lecture entitled Typical Laws of Heredity at the Royal Institution in London.[34] In this lecture, he posited that there must be a counteracting force to maintain population stability. However, this model required a much larger degree of intergenerational natural selection than was plausible.[28]/nIn 1875, Galton started growing sweet peas, and addressed the Royal Institution on his findings on 9 February 1877.[34] He found that each group of progeny seeds followed a normal curve, and the curves were equally disperse. Each group was not centred on the parent's weight, but rather at a weight closer to the population average. Galton called this reversion, as every progeny group was distributed at a value that was closer to the population average than the parent. The deviation from the population average was in the same direction, but the magnitude of the deviation was only one-third as large. In doing so, he demonstrated that there was variability among each of the families, yet the families combined to produce a stable, normally distributed population. When he addressed the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1885, he said of his investigation of sweet peas, \"I was then blind to what I now perceive to be the simple explanation of the phenomenon.\"[31]/nGalton was able to further his notion of regression by collecting and analyzing data on human stature. Galton asked for help of mathematician J. Hamilton Dickson in investigating the geometric relationship of the data. He determined that the regression coefficient did not ensure population stability by chance, but rather that the regression coefficient, conditional variance, and population were interdependent quantities related by a simple equation.[30] Thus Galton identified that the linearity of regression was not coincidental but rather was a necessary consequence of population stability./nThe model for population stability resulted in Galton's formulation of the Law of Ancestral Heredity.  This law, which was published in Natural Inheritance, states that the two parents of an offspring jointly contribute one half of an offspring's heritage, while the other, more-removed ancestors constitute a  smaller proportion of the offspring's heritage.[35] Galton viewed reversion as a spring, that when stretched, would return the distribution of traits back to the normal distribution. He concluded that evolution would have to occur via discontinuous steps, as reversion would neutralize any incremental steps.[36] When Mendel's principles were rediscovered in 1900, this resulted in a fierce battle between the followers of Galton's Law of Ancestral Heredity, the biometricians, and those who advocated Mendel's principles.[37]/nGalton conducted wide-ranging inquiries into heredity which led him to challenge Charles Darwin's hypothesis of pangenesis. Darwin had proposed as part of this model that certain particles, which he called \"gemmules\" moved throughout the body and were also responsible for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Galton, in consultation with Darwin, set out to see if they were transported in the blood. In a long series of experiments in 1869 to 1871, he transfused the blood between dissimilar breeds of rabbits, and examined the features of their offspring.[38] He found no evidence of characters transmitted in the transfused blood.[39]/nDarwin challenged the validity of Galton's experiment, giving his reasons in an article published in Nature where he wrote:/nNow, in the chapter on Pangenesis in my Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication I have not said one word about the blood, or about any fluid proper to any circulating system. It is, indeed, obvious that the presence of gemmules in the blood can form no necessary part of my hypothesis; for I refer in illustration of it to the lowest animals, such as the Protozoa, which do not possess blood or any vessels; and I refer to plants in which the fluid, when present in the vessels, cannot be considered as true blood. The fundamental laws of growth, reproduction, inheritance, &c., are so closely similar throughout the whole organic kingdom, that the means by which the gemmules (assuming for the moment their existence) are diffused through the body, would probably be the same in all beings; therefore the means can hardly be diffusion through the blood. Nevertheless, when I first heard of Mr. Galton's experiments, I did not sufficiently reflect on the subject, and saw not the difficulty of believing in the presence of gemmules in the blood./nGalton explicitly rejected the idea of the inheritance of acquired characteristics (Lamarckism), and was an early proponent of \"hard heredity\"[40] through selection alone. He came close to rediscovering Mendel's particulate theory of inheritance, but was prevented from making the final breakthrough in this regard because of his focus on continuous, rather than discrete, traits (now regarded as polygenic traits). He went on to found the biometric approach to the study of heredity, distinguished by its use of statistical techniques to study continuous traits and population-scale aspects of heredity./nThis approach was later taken up enthusiastically by Karl Pearson and W. F. R. Weldon; together, they founded the highly influential journal Biometrika in 1901.  (R. A. Fisher would later show how the biometrical approach could be reconciled with the Mendelian approach.[41]) The statistical techniques that Galton developed (correlation and regression\u2014see below) and phenomena he established (regression to the mean) formed the basis of the biometric approach and are now essential tools in all social sciences./nIn 1884, London hosted the International Health Exhibition. This exhibition placed much emphasis on highlighting Victorian developments in sanitation and public health, and allowed the nation to display its advanced public health outreach, compared to other countries at the time. Francis Galton took advantage of this opportunity to set up his anthropometric laboratory. He stated that the purpose of this laboratory was to \"show the public the simplicity of the instruments and methods by which the chief physical characteristics of man may be measured and recorded.\"[42] The laboratory was an interactive walk-through in which physical characteristics such as height, weight, and eyesight, would be measured for each subject after payment of an admission fee. Upon entering the laboratory, a subject would visit the following stations in order./nFirst, they would fill out a form with personal and family history (age, birthplace, marital status, residence, and occupation), then visit stations that recorded hair and eye color, followed by the keenness, color-sense, and depth perception of sight. Next, they would examine the keenness, or relative acuteness, of hearing and highest audible note of their hearing followed by an examination of their sense of touch. However, because the surrounding area was noisy, the apparatus intended to measure hearing was rendered ineffective by the noise and echoes in the building. Their breathing capacity would also be measured, as well as their ability to throw a punch. The next stations would examine strength of both pulling and squeezing with both hands. Lastly, subjects' heights in various positions (sitting, standing, etc.) as well as arm span and weight would be measured.[42]/nOne excluded characteristic of interest was the size of the head. Galton notes in his analysis that this omission was mostly for practical reasons. For instance, it would not be very accurate and additionally it would require much time for women to disassemble and reassemble their hair and bonnets.[43] The patrons would then be given a souvenir containing all their biological data, while Galton would also keep a copy for future statistical research./nAlthough the laboratory did not employ any revolutionary measurement techniques, it was unique because of the simple logistics of constructing such a demonstration within a limited space, and because of the speed and efficiency with which all the necessary data were gathered. The laboratory itself was a see-through (lattice-walled) fenced off gallery measuring 36 feet long by 6 feet long. To collect data efficiently, Galton had to make the process as simple as possible for people to understand. As a result, subjects were taken through the laboratory in pairs so that explanations could be given to two at a time, also in the hope that one of the two would confidently take the initiative to go through all the tests first, encouraging the other. With this design, the total time spent in the exhibit was fourteen minutes for each pair.[42]/nGalton states that the measurements of human characteristics are useful for two reasons. First, he states that measuring physical characteristics is useful in order to ensure, on a more domestic level, that children are developing properly. A useful example he gives for the practicality of these domestic measurements is regularly checking a child's eyesight, in order to correct any deficiencies early on. The second use for the data from his anthropometric laboratory is for statistical studies. He comments on the usefulness of the collected data to compare attributes across occupations, residences, races, etc.[42] The exhibit at the health exhibition allowed Galton to collect a large amount of raw data from which to conduct further comparative studies. He had 9,337 respondents, each measured in 17 categories, creating a rather comprehensive statistical database.[43]/nAfter the conclusion of the International Health Exhibition, Galton used these data to confirm in humans his theory of linear regression, posed after studying sweet peas. The accumulation of this human data allowed him to observe the correlation between forearm length and height, head width and head breadth, and head length and height. With these observations he was able to write Co-relations and their Measurements, chiefly from Anthropometric Data.[44] In this publication, Galton defined what co-relation as a phenomenon that occurs when \"the variation of the one [variable] is accompanied on the average by more or less variation of the other, and in the same direction.\"[45]/nThe method used in Hereditary Genius has been described as the first example of historiometry. To bolster these results, and to attempt to make a distinction between 'nature' and 'nurture' (he was the first to apply this phrase to the topic), he devised a questionnaire that he sent out to 190 Fellows of the Royal Society. He tabulated characteristics of their families, such as birth order and the occupation and race of their parents. He attempted to discover whether their interest in science was 'innate' or due to the encouragements of others. The studies were published as a book, English men of science: their nature and nurture, in 1874. In the end, it promoted the nature versus nurture question, though it did not settle it, and provided some fascinating data on the sociology of scientists of the time.[citation needed]/nSir Francis was the first scientist to recognise what is now known as the lexical hypothesis.[46] This is the idea that the most salient and socially relevant personality differences in people's lives will eventually become encoded into language. The hypothesis further suggests that by sampling language, it is possible to derive a comprehensive taxonomy of human personality traits./nGalton's inquiries into the mind involved detailed recording of people's subjective accounts of whether and how their minds dealt with phenomena such as mental imagery. To better elicit this information, he pioneered the use of the questionnaire. In one study, he asked his fellow members of the Royal Society of London to describe mental images that they experienced. In another, he collected in-depth surveys from eminent scientists for a work examining the effects of nature and nurture on the propensity toward scientific thinking.[47]/nCore to any statistical analysis is the concept that measurements vary: they have both a central tendency, or mean, and a spread around this central value, or variance. In the late 1860s, Galton conceived of a measure to quantify normal variation: the standard deviation.[48]/nGalton was a keen observer. In 1906, visiting a livestock fair, he stumbled upon an intriguing contest. An ox was on display, and the villagers were invited to guess the animal's weight after it was slaughtered and dressed. Nearly 800 participated, and Galton was able to study their individual entries after the event. Galton stated that \"the middlemost estimate expresses the vox populi, every other estimate being condemned as too low or too high by a majority of the voters\",[49] and reported this value (the median, in terminology he himself had introduced, but chose not to use on this occasion) as 1,207 pounds. To his surprise, this was within 0.8% of the weight measured by the judges. Soon afterwards, in response to an enquiry, he reported[50] the mean of the guesses as 1,197 pounds, but did not comment on its improved accuracy.  Recent archival research[51] has found some slips in transmitting Galton's calculations to the original article in Nature: the median was actually 1,208 pounds, and the dressed weight of the ox 1,197 pounds, so the mean estimate had zero error.  James Surowiecki[52] uses this weight-judging competition as his opening example: had he known the true result, his conclusion on the wisdom of the crowd would no doubt have been more strongly expressed./nThe same year, Galton suggested in a letter to the journal Nature a better method of cutting a round cake by avoiding making radial incisions.[53]/nStudying variation, Galton invented the Galton board, a pachinko-like device also known as the bean machine, as a tool for demonstrating the law of error and the normal distribution.[11]/nHe also discovered the properties of the bivariate normal distribution and its relationship to correlation and regression analysis./nIn 1846, the French physicist Auguste Bravais (1811\u20131863) first developed what would become the correlation coefficient.[55] After examining forearm and height measurements, Galton independently rediscovered the concept of correlation in 1888[56][57] and demonstrated its application in the study of heredity, anthropology, and psychology.[47] Galton's later statistical study of the probability of extinction of surnames led to the concept of Galton\u2013Watson stochastic processes.[58]/nGalton invented the use of the regression line[59] and for the choice of r (for reversion or regression) to represent the correlation coefficient.[47]/nIn the 1870s and 1880s he was a pioneer in the use of normal theory to fit histograms and ogives to actual tabulated data, much of which he collected himself: for instance large samples of sibling and parental height. Consideration of the results from these empirical studies led to his further insights into evolution, natural selection, and regression to the mean./nGalton was the first to describe and explain the common phenomenon of regression toward the mean, which he first observed in his experiments on the size of the seeds of successive generations of sweet peas./nThe conditions under which regression toward the mean occurs depend on the way the term is mathematically defined. Galton first observed the phenomenon in the context of simple linear regression of data points. Galton[60] developed the following model: pellets fall through a quincunx or \"bean machine\" forming a normal distribution centred directly under their entrance point. These pellets could then be released down into a second gallery (corresponding to a second measurement occasion). Galton then asked the reverse question \"from where did these pellets come?\"/nThe answer was not \"on average directly above\". Rather it was \"on average, more towards the middle\", for the simple reason that there were more pellets above it towards the middle that could wander left than there were in the left extreme that could wander to the right, inwards./nGalton went beyond measurement and summary to attempt to explain the phenomena he observed. Among such developments, he proposed an early theory of ranges of sound and hearing, and collected large quantities of anthropometric data from the public through his popular and long-running Anthropometric Laboratory, which he established in 1884, and where he studied over 9,000 people.[21] It was not until 1985 that these data were analysed in their entirety./nHe made a beauty map of Britain, based on a secret grading of the local women on a scale from attractive to repulsive. The lowest point was in Aberdeen.[61]/nGalton's study of human abilities ultimately led to the foundation of differential psychology and the formulation of the first mental tests. He was interested in measuring humans in every way possible. This included measuring their ability to make sensory discrimination which he assumed was linked to intellectual prowess. Galton suggested that individual differences in general ability are reflected in performance on relatively simple sensory capacities and in speed of reaction to a stimulus, variables that could be objectively measured by tests of sensory discrimination and reaction\ntime.[62] He also measured how quickly people reacted which he later linked to internal wiring which ultimately limited intelligence ability. Throughout his research Galton assumed that people who reacted faster were more intelligent than others./nGalton also devised a technique called \"composite portraiture\" (produced by superimposing multiple photographic portraits of individuals' faces registered on their eyes) to create an average face (see averageness). In the 1990s, a hundred years after his discovery, much psychological research has examined the attractiveness of these faces, an aspect that Galton had remarked on in his original lecture. Others, including Sigmund Freud in his work on dreams, picked up Galton's suggestion that these composites might represent a useful metaphor for an Ideal type or a concept of a \"natural kind\" (see Eleanor Rosch)\u2014such as Jewish men, criminals, patients with tuberculosis, etc.\u2014onto the same photographic plate, thereby yielding a blended whole, or \"composite\", that he hoped could generalise the facial appearance of his subject into an \"average\" or \"central type\".[8][63] (See also entry Modern physiognomy under Physiognomy)./nThis work began in the 1880s while the Jewish scholar Joseph Jacobs studied anthropology and statistics with Francis Galton. Jacobs asked Galton to create a composite photograph of a Jewish type.[64] One of Jacobs' first publications that used Galton's composite imagery was \"The Jewish Type, and Galton's Composite Photographs,\" Photographic News, 29, (24 April 1885): 268\u2013269./nGalton hoped his technique would aid medical diagnosis, and even criminology through the identification of typical criminal faces. However, his technique did not prove useful and fell into disuse, although after much work on it including by photographers Lewis Hine and John L. Lovell and Arthur Batut./nThe method of identifying criminals by their fingerprints had been introduced in the 1860s by Sir William James Herschel in India, and their potential use in forensic work was first proposed by Dr Henry Faulds in 1880. Galton was introduced to the field by his half-cousin Charles Darwin, who was a friend of Faulds's, and he went on to create the first scientific footing for the study (which assisted its acceptance by the courts[65]) although Galton did not ever give credit that the original idea was not his.[66]/nIn a Royal Institution paper in 1888 and three books (Finger Prints, 1892; Decipherment of Blurred Finger Prints, 1893; and Fingerprint Directories, 1895),[67] Galton estimated the probability of two persons having the same fingerprint and studied the heritability and racial differences in fingerprints. He wrote about the technique (inadvertently sparking a controversy between Herschel and Faulds that was to last until 1917), identifying common pattern in fingerprints and devising a classification system that survives to this day. He described and classified them into eight broad categories: 1: plain arch, 2: tented arch, 3: simple loop, 4: central pocket loop, 5: double loop, 6: lateral pocket loop, 7: plain whorl, and 8: accidental.[68]/nIn an effort to reach a wider audience, Galton worked on a novel entitled Kantsaywhere from May until December 1910. The novel described a utopia organized by a eugenic religion, designed to breed fitter and smarter humans. His unpublished notebooks show that this was an expansion of material he had been composing since at least 1901. He offered it to Methuen for publication, but they showed little enthusiasm. Galton wrote to his niece that it should be either \"smothered or superseded\". His niece appears to have burnt most of the novel, offended by the love scenes, but large fragments survived,[69] and it was published online by University College, London.[70]/nGalton is buried in the family tomb in the churchyard of St Michael and All Angels, in the village of Claverdon, Warwickshire.[71]/nIn January 1853, Galton met Louisa Jane Butler (1822\u20131897) at his neighbour's home and they were married on 1 August 1853. The union of 43 years proved childless.[72][73]/nIt has been written of Galton that \"On his own estimation he was a supremely intelligent man.\"[74] Later in life, Galton proposed a connection between genius and insanity based on his own experience:/nMen who leave their mark on the world are very often those who, being gifted and full of nervous power, are at the same time haunted and driven by a dominant idea, and are therefore within a measurable distance of insanity./nAttestations and descriptions of Galton's character were made by Beatrice Webb, James Arthur Harris, and Karl Pearson.[75][76]/nOver the course of his career Galton received many awards, including the Copley Medal of the Royal Society (1910). He received in 1853 the Founder's Medal, the highest award of the Royal Geographical Society, for his explorations and map-making of southwest Africa. He was elected a member of the Athenaeum Club in 1855 and made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1860.

Galton established a laboratory at UCL in 1904. Some students and staff have called on the university to rename its Galton lecture theatre, with journalist Angela Saini stating, \"Galton's seductive promise was of a bold new world filled only with beautiful, intelligent, productive people.

In 2001 Whitchurch undertook further training at the University of California, San Francisco, returning to Australia in 2004.[8][9]/nIn 2004, Whitchurch established her own research group in the Department of Microbiology at Monash University. University of Technology Sydney recruited Whitchurch in 2008; there she leads a research team that is part of the Institute of Infection, Immunity and Innovation (The ithree institute).[10] The team is investigating bacterial lifestyles looking at their connections to infection and antibiotic resistance. Whitchurch established and is the Director of the Microbial Imaging Facility at UTS.[11] In 2019, Whitchurch moved from Australia to join the Quadram Institute in the United Kingdom.[12] Whitchurch's group at the Quadram Institute researches how bacterial communities build biofilms and produce shared resources such as extracellular DNA, moonlighting proteins and membrane vesicles.[13]/nWhitchurch contributed to the discovery of novel roles for DNA unrelated to its genetic function, including the discovery in 2002 that extracellular DNA (eDNA) is required for building multicellular bacterial communities known as biofilms.[5][6] Whitchurch's discovery that extracellular DNA (eDNA) is essential to and promotes the self-organization of biofilms is credited with creating a paradigm shift in the understanding of biofilm biology.[5]/nOne of the bacteria that Whitchurch studies is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common bacterium which has developed a dangerous antibiotic-resistant strain or superbug.

They have used the UTS \"data arena\" to create interactive 360-degree 3-dimensional computational displays representing the behavior of bacterial cells. Color-coding cells according to the speed at which they move, and studying the ways in which bacteria move across surfaces, helps Whitchurch to visualize behaviors in new ways. Recognizing that P. aeruginosa tends to create and follow pathways (a process known as stigmergy[1]) has led her to experiment with the use of furrowed surfaces in catheters. This appears to disrupt the movement of the bacteria and may help to prevent infection.[3][15]/nIn 2016, Whitchurch, Lynne Turnbull and other researchers from Australia, Japan and Switzerland discovered that the bacterium P. aeruginosa can actively explode, widely distributing its contents when it dies. Its protein, DNA, and virulence factors then become available to other bacterium and support the formation of increasingly dangerous biofilms. A particular gene appears to support both this explosive cell lysis and the formation of biofilms. This suggests possibilities for treatment.[16][17]/n\"The normal bacteria look like little rods or pills,\" says Whitchurch. \"One day, as we looked under the microscope, we saw one of the cells turn from a hard, structured rod into a round, soft ball.

IR, which stands for international rice is used as a prefix to the number rice crosses.[16] The objective of IRRI\u2019s breeding program was to create a variety that grew efficiently in the tropical region.[17] IR8 was the first improved variety as it was more resistant to diseases, more sensitive to applied nitrogen, and had double yield potential.[17] However, IR8 had poor grain quality and was not desirable to several Asian countries. Athwal's work contributed to the release of new varieties such as IR20, IR22, IR24, and IR26.[15] These new varieties had IR8\u2019s high yield potential and good grain quality.[17] Athwal retired from the IRRI in 1977 and later joined the International Agriculture Development Services.[18]/nResearch/Field\nAthwal was known for his pioneering work in the development of wheat varieties from strains from Mexico in the 1960s.[18] During his time at Punjab University, Athwal created a hybrid millet known as \u2018HB-1\u2019 (Hybrid Bajra 1) that dramatically transformed production in India by increasing yield from 3.5 million tons in 1965 to 8 million tons in 1970.[18] With help from Nobel laureate, Dr. Norman Borlaug, Athwal selected breeding lines that were most beneficial and delivered those lines to wheat breeders across India.[18]/nWheat varieties that prominently thrived in Punjab soil were red, which is considered unattractive for Indian consumers and farmers. Athwal\u2019s solution was genetically modifying two wheat varieties, Lerma Rojo 64 and PV 18  (a high-yielding red-grained wheat variety).[14] This modification produced amber-coloured grains that retained the desirable qualities of the sister strain.[14][18] The genetic modification of two wheat varieties (eg. Lerma Rojo 64 and PV 18), using a multistep process, produced a variety of superior qualities such as higher resistance to rust.[19] First, seeds from lines with similar genetic makeup and appearance are mechanically mixed to produce a multiline variety.[19] These lines are bred for desired traits and the ones showing susceptibility to the undesirable quality are removed and replaced. Afterwards, the best lines with desirable traits (eg. rust resistance) are chosen and multiplied separately. These separate lines with the most desirable qualities are mixed and multiplied to grow before being released to farmers.[19] According to the deputy director of CIMMYT\u2019s (International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center) wheat program, multiline varieties should involve 15-20 lines.[19]/nAthwal\u2019s work on crossing Lerma Rojo 64 and PV 18 and creating a new multiline gave rise to a new wheat variety which was named Kalyan 227, after Athwal\u2019s home village.[14][18] Kalyan 227 was released in 1967 and was known as \u201cKalyan Sona\" or \"Golden Savior\".

Hundreds if not thousands of others were imprisoned. Several were sentenced to death as enemies of the state, including the botanist Nikolai Vavilov.[6] Lysenko's ideas and practices contributed to the famines that killed millions of Soviet people;[6] the adoption of his methods from 1958 in the People's Republic of China had similarly calamitous results, culminating in the Great Chinese Famine of 1959 to 1962.[6]/nThe son of Denis and Oksana Lysenko, Trofim Lysenko was born into a peasant family of Ukrainian ethnicity in Karlivka, Poltava Governorate (present-day Poltava Oblast, Ukraine) on 29 September 1898.[7]/nAs a young man working at the Kyiv Agricultural Institute (now the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine), Lysenko found himself interested in agriculture, where he worked on a few different projects, one involving the effects of temperature variation on the life-cycle of plants. This later led him to consider how he might use this work to convert winter wheat into spring wheat. He named the process \"jarovization\" in Russian, and later translated it as \"vernalization\".[8]/nThe conversion of winter wheat into spring wheat was not a new discovery. Scientific experiments had been done by Nikolai Vavilov.[9] It was Vavilov who initially supported Lysenko and encouraged him in his work. Lysenko had a difficult time trying to grow various crops (such as peas and wheat) through the harsh winters. However, when he announced success, he was praised in the Soviet newspaper Pravda for his claims to have discovered a method to fertilize fields without using fertilizers or minerals, and to have shown that a winter crop of peas could be grown in Azerbaijan, \"turning the barren fields of the Transcaucasus green in winter, so that cattle will not perish from poor feeding, and the peasant Turk will live through the winter without trembling for tomorrow.\"[10]/nLysenko worked with different wheat crops to try to convert them to grow in different seasons. Another area Lysenko found himself interested in was the effect of heat on plant growth. He believed that every plant needed a determinate amount of heat throughout its lifetime. He attempted to correlate the time and the amount of heat required by a particular plant to go through various phases of development. To get his data he looked at the amount of growth, how many days went by, and the temperature on those days, instead of measuring any actual heat. In trying to determine the effects, he was making mistakes in statistical analysis of data. He was confronted by Maksimov, who was an expert on thermal plant development. Lysenko did not take well to this or any criticism. After this encounter, Lysenko boldly claimed that mathematics had no place in biology.[10]/nHis experimental research in improved crop yields earned him the support of the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, especially following the famine and loss of productivity resulting from crop failures and forced collectivization in several regions of the Soviet Union in the early 1930s./nIn 1927, at the age of 29, working at an agricultural experiment station in Azerbaijan, Lysenko embarked on the research that would lead to his 1928 paper on vernalization, which drew wide attention because of its potential practical implications for Soviet agriculture. Severe cold and lack of winter snow had destroyed many early winter-wheat seedlings. By treating wheat seeds with moisture as well as cold, Lysenko induced them to bear a crop when planted in spring. Lysenko coined the term \"Jarovization\" (\u044f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f) to describe this chilling process, which he used to make the seeds of winter cereals behave like spring cereals. (Because spring cereals are called Jarovoe in Russian \u2013 from jarov\u00f3j, an archaic adjective meaning spring, especially in relation to crops). However, this method had already been known by farmers since the 1800s, and had recently been discussed in detail by Gustav Gassner in 1918. Lysenko himself translated Jarovization as \"vernalization\" (from the Latin vernum meaning Spring).[11] Lysenko's claims for increased yields were based on plantings over a few hectares, and he believed that the vernalized transformation could be inherited, that the offspring of a vernalized plant would themselves possess the capabilities of the generation that preceded it\u00a0\u2013 that it too would be able to withstand harsh winters or imperfect weather conditions.[12]/nLysenko rejected Mendelian genetic inheritance theory in favour of his own logic. He believed Gregor Mendel's theory to be too reactionary or idealist. Lysenko's ideas were a mixture of his own, those of Russian agronomist Ivan Michurin, and of other Soviet scientists.[14] Through this mixture of ideas, Lysenko founded the \"Michurinist\" school of thought.[14] The core ideas are that body cells (the soma) determine the quality of an organism's offspring; every part of the body contributes to the germ cells, in the manner of Darwin's theory of pangenesis, though Lysenko denied any such connection.[15]/nThese ideas were not directly derived from established biological theories such as Mendelian genetics, Lamarckism or Darwinism. He shaped his genetic concepts to support the simple practical purpose of breeding and improving crops. His ideas were also shaped to disprove other claims made by his fellow geneticists. His ideas and genetic claims later began to be termed \"Lysenkoism\". He claimed that his ideas were not associated with Lamarckism, but there are similarities between the two ideas, such as a belief in the inheritance of acquired characteristics.[15] Some of Lysenko's ideas can also seem to be vitalistic. He claimed that plants are self-sacrificing\u2014they do not die due to a lack of sunlight or moisture but so that healthy ones may live and when they die they deposit themselves over the growing roots to help the new generation survive.[citation needed]/nLysenko believed that in one generation of a hybridized crop, the desired individual could be selected, mated again and continue to produce the same desired product, not worrying about separation/segregation in future breeds. For that to work, he had to assume that after a lifetime of developing (acquiring) the best set of traits to survive, those were passed down to the next generation.[10] That assumption disregarded the potential for variation or mutation./nLysenko did not believe in genes and only spoke about them to say that they did not exist. He instead believed that any body, once alive, obtained heredity. That meant that the entirety of the body was able to pass on the hereditary information of that organism, and was not entirely dependent on a special element such as DNA or genes.[10] That puzzled biologists at that time because it went against established notions of heredity and inheritance. It also contradicted the Mendelian principles that most biologists had been using to base their ideas on.[16] Most scientists believed that Lysenko's ideas were not credible, because they did not truly explain the mechanisms of inheritance. Biologists now consider that his beliefs are pseudo-scientific, with little relationship to genetics.[10]/nLysenko argued that there is not only competition, but also mutual assistance among individuals within a species, and that mutual assistance also exists between different species./nAccording to Lysenko,/nThe organism and the conditions required for its life are an inseparable unity. Different living bodies require different environmental conditions for their development. By studying these requirements we come to know the qualitative features of the nature of organisms, the qualitative features of heredity. Heredity is the property of a living body to require definite conditions for its life and development and to respond in a definite way to various conditions.[17]/nAnother of Lysenko's theories was that obtaining more milk from cows did not depend on their genetics but on how they were treated. The better they were handled and taken care of, the more milk would be obtained; Lysenko and his followers were well known for taking very good care of their livestock.[18] Lysenko claimed that the cuckoo was born when young birds such as warblers were fed hairy caterpillars by the parent (rather than host) birds; this claim failed to recognise that the cuckoos he described were brood parasites.[19] Lysenkoites believed that fertilization was not random, but that there was specific selection of the best mate. For reasons like these, Lysenkoism can be viewed as pseudo-scientific./nAfter World War II ended, Lysenko took an interest in the works of Olga Lepeshinskaya, an older feldsher and biologist, who claimed to be able to create cells from egg yolk and non-cellular matter. Lepeshinskaya recognized common ground between her ideas and Lysenko's. By combining both of their ideas it was possible to proclaim that cells could grow from non-cellular material and that the predicted ratios of Mendelian genetics and meiosis were incorrect, thus undermining the basis of modern cytology, as well as genetics.[10]/nLysenko forced farmers to plant seeds very close together since, according to his \"law of the life of species\", plants from the same \"class\" never compete with one another.[6] Lysenko played an active role in the famines that killed millions of Soviet people and his practices prolonged and exacerbated the food shortages.[6] The People's Republic of China under Mao Zedong adopted his methods starting in 1958, with calamitous results, culminating in the Great Chinese Famine of 1959 to 1962, in which some 15\u201355 million people died.[note 1][6]/nOutside the Soviet Union, scientists spoke critically: British biologist S. C. Harland lamented that Lysenko was \"completely ignorant of the elementary principles of genetics and plant physiology\" (Bertram Wolfe, 2017). Criticism from foreigners did not sit well with Lysenko, who loathed Western \"bourgeois\" scientists and denounced them as tools of imperialist oppressors. He especially detested the American-born practice of studying fruit flies, the workhorse of modern genetics. He called such geneticists \"fly lovers and people haters\".[28]/nDuring the 1930s and '40s, the V.I. Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences (VASKhNIL) served as a floor for debate between Lysenkoists and geneticists. On August 7, 1948, at the end of a week-long session organized by Lysenko and approved by Stalin,[29] the VASKhNIL announced that from that point on Lysenkoism would be taught as \"the only correct theory.\" Soviet scientists were forced to denounce any work that contradicted Lysenko.[30] Several geneticists who refused to denounce the theory were executed (including Izrail Agol, Solomon Levit, Grigorii Levitskii, Georgii Karpechenko and Georgii Nadson) or sent to labor camps. One prominent critic of Lysenko, the famous Soviet geneticist and president of the Agriculture Academy, Nikolai Vavilov, was arrested in 1940 and died in prison in 1943.[31] Before the 1930s, the Soviet Union had arguably the best genetics community. According to The Atlantic writer Sam Kean, \"Lysenko gutted it, and by some accounts, set Russian biology and agronomy back a half-century\".[6] Lysenko's work was eventually recognized as fraudulent by some, \"but not before he had wrecked the lives of many and destroyed the reputation of Russian biology\" according to scientist Peter Gluckman.[32]/nDuring the early and mid twentieth century the Soviet Union went through war and revolution. Political oppression caused tension within the state but also promoted the flourishing of science: this was possible due to the flow of resources and demand for results. Lysenko aimed to manipulate various plants such as wheat and peas to increase their production, quality, and quantity, while he impressed political officials with his success in motivating peasants to return to farming.[33]/nThe Soviet Union's collectivist reforms forced the confiscation of agricultural landholdings from peasant farmers and heavily damaged the country's overall food production, and the dispossessed peasant farmers posed new problems for the regime. Many had abandoned the farms altogether; many more waged resistance to collectivization by poor work quality and pilfering. The dislocated and disenchanted peasant farmers were a major political concern to the USSR's leadership.[34] Lysenko became prominent during this period by advocating radical but unproven agricultural methods, and also promising that the new methods provided wider opportunities for year-round work in agriculture. He proved himself very useful to the Soviet leadership by reengaging peasants to return to work, helping to secure from them a personal stake in the overall success of the Soviet revolutionary experiment.[33]/nLysenko's success at encouraging farmers to return to working their lands impressed Stalin, who also approved of Lysenko's peasant background, as Stalin claimed to stand with the proletariat. By the late 1920s, the USSR's leaders had given their support to Lysenko. This support was a consequence, in part, of policies put in place by the Communist Party to rapidly promote members of the proletariat into leadership positions in agriculture, science and industry. Party officials were looking for promising candidates with backgrounds similar to Lysenko's: born of a peasant family, without formal academic training or affiliations to the academic community.[35] Due to close partnership between Stalin and Lysenko, Lysenko acquired an influence over genetics in the Soviet Union during the early and mid twentieth century. Lysenko eventually became the director of Genetics for the Academy of Sciences in 1940, which gave him even more control over genetics.[5] He remained in the position for more than two decades, throughout   the reigns of Stalin and Nikita Khruschchev, until he was relieved of his duties in 1965./nIn 1955, an attempt was made to disempower Lysenko, with a letter signed by more than three hundred scientists, the so-called \"Letter of three hundred\", which was sent to Nikita Khrushchev. It led to Lysenko resigning temporarily but he returned to power through the efforts of Khrushchev.[36] Though Lysenko remained at his post in the Institute of Genetics until 1965, his influence on Soviet agricultural practice had declined after the death of Stalin in 1953.[37] Lysenko retained his position, with the support of the new leader Nikita Khrushchev. However, mainstream scientists re-emerged and found new willingness within Soviet government leadership to tolerate criticism of Lysenko, the first opportunity since the late 1920s. In 1962, three of the most prominent Soviet physicists, Yakov Zeldovich, Vitaly Ginzburg, and Pyotr Kapitsa, presented a case against Lysenko, proclaiming his work as pseudoscience. They also denounced Lysenko's application of political power to silence opposition and eliminate his opponents within the scientific community. These denunciations occurred during a period of structural upheaval in Soviet government, during which the major institutions were purged of the strictly ideological and political machinations which had controlled the work of the Soviet Union's scientific community for several decades under Stalin./nIn 1964, physicist Andrei Sakharov spoke out against Lysenko in the General Assembly of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR:/nHe is responsible for the shameful backwardness of Soviet biology and of genetics in particular, for the dissemination of pseudo-scientific views, for adventurism, for the degradation of learning, and for the defamation, firing, arrest, even death, of many genuine scientists.[38]/nThe Soviet press was soon filled with anti-Lysenkoite articles and appeals for the restoration of scientific methods to all fields of biology and agricultural science. In 1965,[39][40] Lysenko was removed from his post as director of the Institute of Genetics at the Academy of Sciences and restricted to an experimental farm in Moscow's Lenin Hills (the Institute itself was soon dissolved). After Khrushchev's dismissal in 1964, the president of the Academy of Sciences declared that Lysenko's immunity to criticism had officially ended. An expert commission was sent to investigate records kept at Lysenko's experimental farm. His secretive methods and ideas were revealed. A few months later, a devastating critique of Lysenko was made public.[41] Consequently, Lysenko was immediately disgraced in the Soviet Union.[42]/nAfter Lysenko's monopoly on biology and agronomy had ended, it took many years for these sciences to recover in Russia. Lysenko died in Moscow in 1976, and was ultimately interred in the Kuntsevo Cemetery,[43] although the Soviet government refused to announce Lysenko's death for two days after the event[44] and gave his passing only a small note in Izvestia.[45]", "24494119": "John Charles Avise (born 1948) is an American evolutionary geneticist, conservationist, ecologist and natural historian. He is a Distinguished Professor of Ecology & Evolution, University of California, Irvine, and was previously a Distinguished Professor of Genetics at the University of Georgia./nBorn in Grand Rapids, Michigan, he received his B.S. in 1970 in Natural Resources from the University of Michigan; his M.A.in 1971 in Zoology from the University of Texas at Austin; and his Ph.D. in 1975 in Genetics from the University of California, Davis. Avise's research entails the use of molecular markers to analyze ecological, behavioral, and evolutionary processes in nature.[1]\nIt covers a broad spectrum of topics: genetic parentage, reproductive modes, population structure, speciation, hybridization, introgression, phylogeography, systematics, and phylogenetics. He has conducted research on diverse animal taxa ranging from corals and sponges to representatives of all the major vertebrate groups./nIn 1972, Avise published the first multi-locus allozyme analysis in any fish species, and uncovered a profound effect of genetic drift in nature.  During the 1970s and 1980s, his protein-electrophoretic work on many fishes, mammals, and birds demonstrated that natural populations are genetically highly polymorphic and that molecular markers can be utilized to address many natural-history topics that previously had been analyzed solely from phenotypic data.  He thereby helped to pioneer the fields of molecular ecology and molecular evolution.  In 1994, he published Molecular Markers, Natural History and Evolution, a comprehensive textbook on the application of genetic markers in ecological, behavioral, and evolutionary contexts.\nIn the late 1970s, he was among the first to introduce mitochondrial (mt) DNA to population biology.  This seminal work laid the foundation for phylogeography,[2] a field for which he is recognized as the founding father. Among the many phylogeographic applications for which his laboratory paved the way were genetic assessments of marine and freshwater turtles, catadromous eels, unisexual fishes, and regional assemblages of birds, fishes, mammals, herps, and marine invertebrates. In the 1990s, Avise capitalized upon highly polymorphic microsatellite loci to analyze animal mating systems in nature, on creatures ranging from sea spiders and snails to polyembryonic armadillos to numerous fishes, including male-pregnant pipefishes and seahorses, and hermaphroditic killifishes. This line of inquiry eventuated in many articles plus a trilogy of books dealing with evolutionary perspectives on clonality (2008), hermaphroditism (2011), and pregnancy (2013). In addition to research in molecular ecology and evolution, Avise has published on the relevance of evolutionary genetics to human affairs ranging from religious beliefs, to the human genome, to genetically modified organisms, to the history and philosophy of science.  In 2006, Avise helped to inaugurate a series of annual Sachler Colloquia, sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences, entitled \"In the Light of Evolution\" (ILE).  Each ILE installment highlights a topic that can be informed by evolutionary thought and has broader societal relevance.  Proceedings of ten ILE colloquia were published in PNAS, and most also appeared as edited books from the National Academies Press./nIn 2020, Avise retired from the University of California Irvine so his status is now Distinguished Professor Emeritus at that institution.

She was the first to show that breast cancer can be inherited due to mutations in the gene she called BRCA1. She studies human genetics and is particularly interested in genetic heterogeneity and complex traits.[2] She studies the interaction of genetics and environmental influences and their effects on human conditions such as breast and ovarian cancer, inherited deafness, schizophrenia,[3] HIV,  systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.[4] She has been the American Cancer Society Professor of the Department of Genome Sciences and of Medical Genetics in the Department of Medicine at the University of Washington since 1995.[5]/nBesides known for her accomplishment in identifying breast cancer genes, King is also known for demonstrating that humans and chimpanzees are 99% genetically identical and for applying genomic sequencing to identify victims of human rights abuses. In 1984, in Argentina, she began working in identifying children who had been stolen from their families and adopted illegally under the military dictatorship during the Dirty War (1976\u20131983). She has received many awards, including the Lasker Award and the National Medal of Science. In 2002, Discover magazine recognized King  as one of the 50 most important women in science.[6]/nMary-Claire King was born on  February 27, 1946, to Harvey and Clarice King of Wilmette, Illinois, near Chicago. Her father  worked for Standard Oil of Indiana.[1]\nWhen King was 15 years old, her childhood best friend died of cancer. King became interested in science in the hope of learning enough to prevent and treat such illnesses.[7]/nKing received her undergraduate degree in mathematics (cum laude) from Carleton College,  Phi Beta Kappa,  in 1967.[8][9]/nKing was accepted into the graduate program at the University of California, Berkeley, and soon became politically active. She helped to organize protests against U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War in 1970. She says: \"The single most effective thing we did was on the day after the US invaded Cambodia, we got out our suit jackets and shirtwaist dresses \u2013 not clothes that any of us had worn since coming to Berkeley \u2013 and went to the synagogues and churches and by the end of Sunday we had 30,000 letters opposing the action.\"[10]\nShe dropped out of university briefly after the National Guard was sent in against student protestors.[11][12]/nShe spent a year doing consumer advocacy work for Ralph Nader, investigating pesticide use and its effects on farm workers.[11][12]/nAfter her return to Berkeley, advisor Allan Wilson persuaded her to switch from mathematics to genetics.[13] King had been introduced to genetics by professor Curt Stern, in the last class he taught before his retirement.[14]\nIn her doctoral work at Berkeley, King demonstrated through comparative protein analysis that chimpanzees and humans were 99% genetically identical. King's work supported Allan Wilson's view that chimpanzees and humans diverged only five million years ago, and King and Wilson suggested that gene regulation was likely responsible for the significant differences between the species.[15][16][17] King completed her thesis in 1972, and received her doctorate in genetics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1973.[9][17]/nNext King went to Santiago, Chile to teach at the Universidad de Chile as part of a University of California-University of Chile exchange program. Her time there was cut short when the Chilean government of Salvador Allende was overthrown in a CIA-backed military coup on September 11, 1973. King and her husband Robert Colwell returned to Berkeley in late December.[13][18]\nShe later learned that a number of her colleagues and students had either disappeared or been killed.[19]/nKing accepted a postdoctoral position at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), to work with Nicholas L. Petrakis. As of January 1, 1974, King began to work on the problem of why breast cancer tends to appear in families.[18][13]/nKing's younger brother Paul King, a mathematician and business consultant, was the CEO of Vanalco in Vancouver, Washington.[20]/nKing married ecologist Robert K. Colwell in 1973.[21] They have one child, Emily King Colwell, born in 1975.[22] Emily studied the evolution of languages at Brown University with a B.A. in linguistics. King and Colwell divorced in 1983./nKing accepted a faculty appointment at the University of California, Berkeley, as professor of genetics and epidemiology in 1976. She remained at UC Berkeley until 1995, when she accepted an appointment as the American Cancer Society Professor at the University of Washington.[5] She also served on the Life Sciences jury for the Infosys Prize in 2015./nFrom 1974 to 1990, King carried out years of painstaking research, seeking a genetic marker, an identifiable piece of genetic material, that tended to accompany the presence of breast cancer in families.[23] For much of that time, the predominant theory was that cancer was viral.[7]  Most scientists disregarded or attacked her ideas. The idea that genetic patterns could be linked to the incidence of complex diseases was considered an unlikely long shot.[22]  Genetics had been recognized as significant in diseases with a simple genetic tie, such as Huntington's disease, cystic fibrosis, and sickle-cell anemia, but researchers were skeptical about the usefulness of genetics in studying more common and complex diseases involving both multiple genetic factors and environmental influences. King sometimes worried that she was going down a blind alley in trying to study the interplay of genetics with a complex human disease.[22]/nNonetheless, the search for the breast cancer susceptibility gene was moving forward with firm steps in King's lab and accelerating in the mid-1980s.  On the basis of a series of unselected breast cancer cases and their family history, in 1988, King's team published a genetic epidemiological model for breast cancer, demonstrating the theoretical existence of a major dominant gene that conferred a high degree of susceptibility to breast cancer in a subset of the population.  Applying this genetic penetrance model and using the genotyping technology available at the time, King's team evaluated more than 170 genetic markers, utilizing the gene mapping technique known as linkage analysis. When they in 1990 finally found a genetic  marker that showed strong evidence in a subset of families, King's group demonstrated that a single gene on chromosome 17 could be linked to many breast and ovarian cancers, and that genetic heterogeneity was present in breast cancer etiology. A team member suggested that they reorganize their data by age of onset, as in the study cohort, the families in which members had developed cancer at a relatively young age tended to show stronger evidence of linkage to this locus. The idea was that early cases might be more likely to reflect a genetic component, in contrast to sporadic mutations that might occur at any age or even accrue over time. As many as 5\u201310% of all cases of breast cancer may be hereditary.[24][23][25]  In 1991 King officially named the gene BRCA1.[26]\nHer discovery paved the way for identification of the gene sequence. In September 1994, Myriad Genetics published a paper on the positional cloning of the sequence after a highly publicized \"race\" by groups of scientists.[27][28][26] In December 1994, King and her collaborators published results based on a second cohort of families.[28][29]  A second gene, BRCA2, was also found.[27] These two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, work to clean up cells in the body that have been harmed by things such as tobacco or just help clean the cells because they have aged. When these genes do not perform these functions, cells will grow and divide quickly, leading to some types of cancers.[30][31] Both genes worked to suppress the development of cancer tumors, but certain types of genetic mutations could prevent them from doing so.[24]/nIn 1996, with support from the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF) Mary-Claire King and social worker Joan Marks began the New York Breast Cancer Study, which definitively determined that incidence of breast and ovarian cancer was linked to inherited mutations of the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2.  The researchers studied women of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry in New York, a group that was known to have a very high incidence of breast cancer (up to an 80% risk by age 70, compared with 12% in the general population).[32][33] She has also studied the incidence of breast cancer in Palestinian women.[34]/nThe discovery of the \"breast cancer gene\" revolutionized the study of numerous other diseases and phenotypes. The model and technique King developed to identify BRCA1 has since proven valuable in the study of many other illnesses and conditions.[18] King's contributions have made it possible for people to be informed of genetic information that then can aid them in making choices best for themselves and for their future.[35][22]/nKing also worked on a project studying the mutations of genes linked to breast cancer inheritance in Nigerian women between March 1998 and 2014. King's team decided to do this research on the grounds that more people die in Nigeria from triple negative breast cancer that is diagnosed at a later stage than other, more educated regions of the world, such as Europe or America. At the finish of this study, King's team was still unsure of the reason for such high levels of Triple-negative breast cancer, since many of the people diagnosed were not showing mutations in the BRCA1 gene. Her study supported the idea that genomic sequencing could be useful as a tool to help detect gene mutations early and be proactive in letting those who have high risks for breast cancer know ahead of time.[36]/nSince 1990, King has been working in collaboration with scientists around the world to identify genetic causes of hearing loss and deafness. They localized the first nonsyndromic deafness-related gene, DFNA1, in a Costa Rica kindred,[37] and successfully cloned the gene in 1999.[38][39][40]/nKing continues to work with scientists Karen Avraham at Tel Aviv University in Israel and Moien Kanaan at Bethlehem University in Palestine, modeling international scientific cooperation in conjunction with conducting scientific research.  Hereditary deafness is common among some Palestinian and Israeli communities, providing good study populations to understand the genetics of this condition.[41][42]/nWe understand that working together transcends politics. It's possible to do beautiful useful science together, even between countries that are in conflict./nThe genetic etiology of hearing loss is extremely heterogeneous, with a very high degree of complexity among Middle Eastern populations, presenting a different level of challenge for genetic analysis.  King's collaboration with scientists in Israel and Palestine has resolved the complex web of different genes and varying modes of transmission for this common phenotype among many kindreds in the communities in that region./nKing in recent years has developed a deep interest in studying the genetic factors influencing schizophrenia.   In collaboration with other scientists including Judith L. Rapoport, Jonathan Sebat, and Deborah L. Levy, she has discovered evidence that suggests that schizophrenia may be linked to the presence of genetic mutations called copy number variations (CNVs) in pathways involved in neural development. A percentage of such variations may occur spontaneously as a result of copying errors in cells.[43][44][45][46]/nKing has also worked on the Human Genome Diversity Project, led by Luca Cavalli-Sforza.  The project seeks to delineate the distinctions among individuals in order to further understanding of human evolution and historical migrations.[3][47][48][49]/nKing is well known for her work on the forensic determination of individual identity, in particular the use of mitochondrial DNA from teeth.[50]\nKing was invited to participate in DNA investigations of the first analysis of Romanov remains exhumed in 1991 in Ekaterinburg, Russia.[51]/nKing first applied her genetics skills to human rights work in 1984, when she and her lab began working with Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo (Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo) in Argentina. She used dental genetics to identify missing persons, ultimately identifying 59 children and helping return them to their biological families. Most had been born to women in prison who had been persecuted as political dissidents and were later \"disappeared\" by the Argentine military dictatorship during the eight-year \"Dirty War\" from 1976 to 1983. These children were often illegally \"adopted\" by military families without their mother's or other family consent.[7][3]/nBeginning in 1977 Las Abuelas (\"the grandmothers\") had gathered to protest the disappearance of their grandchildren and seek their return. Every Thursday, they marched to the central plaza in Buenos Aires (\"Plaza de Mayo\") to demand the return of their grandchildren, and they began gathering data trying to identify the many missing children (estimated to be 400\u2013500).[3]/nBy the time King joined the project, the dictatorship had been replaced by a democratic government, but it required proof of kinship to remove children from families and return them to biological families. King's technique, using mitochondrial DNA and human leukocyte antigen serotyping genetic markers from dental samples, proved invaluable. The Supreme Court of Argentina in 1984 determined that King's test had positively identified the relationship of Paula Logares to her family, establishing the precedent for the ultimate reunification of dozens of families with their stolen children.[52][3]/nSince 1984, this technique has become a major method for genetic identification of the deceased as well as the living. In 1993 King used the technique to identify the remains of individuals massacred in the village of El Mozote, El Salvador. More than 750 adults and children were massacred and buried in mass graves by US-trained Salvadoran soldiers[3] of the Atl\u00e1catl Battalion.[53]/nKing has worked with numerous human rights organizations, such as Physicians for Human Rights and Amnesty International, to identify missing people in countries including Argentina,[54] Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Rwanda, the Balkans (Croatia and Serbia), and the Philippines.[55][56] King's lab has also provided DNA identification for the U.S. Army,[57] the United Nations,[58] and the U.N.'s war crimes tribunals.[59]/nKing has been highly critical of genetic patenting, a practice which was ruled against by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013, on the grounds that \"genes are natural products and cannot be patented\".[7][60]/nDr. King has won numerous awards, prizes, and honors for her scientific and humanitarian work, including:.[61]/nKing has five patents and over 250 peer-reviewed journal articles./nQuotations related to Mary-Claire King at Wikiquote", "58900635": "Jeanne A.

He is best known for proposing the Gaia hypothesis, which postulates that the Earth functions as a self-regulating system.[3]/nWith a PhD in medicine, Lovelock began his career performing cryopreservation experiments on rodents, including successfully thawing frozen specimens. His methods were influential in the theories of cryonics (the cryopreservation of humans). He invented the electron capture detector and, using it, became the first to detect the widespread presence of chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere. While designing scientific instruments for NASA, he developed the Gaia hypothesis./nIn the 2000s, he proposed a method of climate engineering to restore carbon dioxide\u2013consuming algae. He was an outspoken member of Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy,[4] asserting that fossil fuel interests have been behind opposition to nuclear energy, citing the effects of carbon dioxide as being harmful to the environment, and warning of global warming due to the greenhouse effect. He wrote several environmental science books based upon the Gaia hypothesis from the late 1970s./nHe also worked for MI5, the British security service, for decades.[5] Bryan Appleyard, writing in The Sunday Times, described him as \"basically Q in the James Bond films\".[6]/nJames Lovelock was born in Letchworth Garden City to Tom Arthur Lovelock and his second wife Nellie.[7] Nell, his mother, was born in Bermondsey and won a scholarship to a grammar school but was unable to take it up, and started work at thirteen in a pickle factory. She was described by Lovelock as a socialist and suffragist, who was also anti-vaccine, and did not allow Lovelock to receive his smallpox inoculation as a child.[8] His father, Tom, was born in Fawley, Berkshire, had served six months hard labour for poaching in his teens, and was illiterate until attending technical college, later running a bookshop.[9] Lovelock was brought up a Quaker and imbued with the notion that \"God is a still, small voice within rather than some mysterious old gentleman way out in the universe\", which he thought was a helpful way of thinking for inventors, but he would eventually end up as being non-religious.[10] The family moved to London, where his dislike of authority made him, by his own account, an unhappy pupil at Strand School in Tulse Hill, south London.[11]/nLovelock could not at first afford to go to university, something which he believed helped prevent him from becoming overspecialised and aided the development of Gaia theory.[12]/nAfter leaving school Lovelock worked at a photography firm, attending Birkbeck College during the evenings, before being accepted to study chemistry at the University of Manchester, where he was a student of the Nobel Prize laureate professor Alexander R. Todd.[13] Lovelock worked at a Quaker farm before a recommendation from his professor led to him taking up a Medical Research Council post,[2] working on ways of shielding soldiers from burns. Lovelock refused to use the shaved and anaesthetised rabbits that were used as burn victims, and exposed his skin to heat radiation instead, an experience he describes as \"exquisitely painful\".[9] His student status enabled temporary deferment of military service during the Second World War. Still, he registered as a conscientious objector.[14] He later abandoned his conscientious objection in the light of Nazi atrocities and tried to enlist in the armed forces but was told that his medical research was too valuable for the enlistment to be approved.[15]/nIn 1948, Lovelock received a PhD degree in medicine at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.[16] He spent the next two decades working at London's National Institute for Medical Research.[14] In the United States, he conducted research at Yale, Baylor College of Medicine, and Harvard University.[2]/nIn the mid-1950s, Lovelock experimented with the cryopreservation of rodents, determining that hamsters could be frozen and revived successfully.[17] Hamsters were frozen with 60% of the water in the brain crystallised into ice with no adverse effects recorded. Other organs were shown to be susceptible to damage.[18]/nA lifelong inventor, Lovelock created and developed many scientific instruments, some of which were designed for NASA in its planetary exploration program. While working as a NASA consultant, Lovelock developed the Gaia hypothesis, for which he is most widely known.[19]/nIn early 1961, Lovelock was engaged by NASA to develop sensitive instruments for the analysis of extraterrestrial atmospheres and planetary surfaces.[20] The Viking program, which visited Mars in the late 1970s, was motivated in part to determine whether Mars supported life, and some of the sensors and experiments that were ultimately deployed aimed to resolve this issue. During work on a precursor of this program, Lovelock became interested in the composition of the Martian atmosphere, reasoning that many life forms on Mars would be obliged to make use of it (and, thus, alter it). However, the atmosphere was found to be in a stable condition close to its chemical equilibrium, with very little oxygen, methane, or hydrogen, but with an overwhelming abundance of carbon dioxide. To Lovelock, the stark contrast between the Martian atmosphere and chemically dynamic mixture of the Earth's biosphere was strongly indicative of the absence of life on Mars.[21] However, when they were finally launched to Mars, the Viking probes still searched (unsuccessfully) for extant life there. Further experiments to search for life on Mars have been carried out by additional space probes, for instance, by NASA's Perseverance rover, which landed in 2021./nLovelock invented the electron capture detector, which ultimately assisted in discoveries about the persistence of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and their role in stratospheric ozone depletion.[22][23][24] After studying the operation of the Earth's sulphur cycle,[25] Lovelock and his colleagues, Robert Jay Charlson, Meinrat Andreae and Stephen G. Warren developed the CLAW hypothesis as a possible example of biological control of the Earth's climate.[26]/nLovelock was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1974.[27] He served as the president of the Marine Biological Association (MBA) from 1986 to 1990 and was an Honorary Visiting Fellow of Green Templeton College, Oxford (formerly Green College, Oxford) from 1994.[28]/nAs an independent scientist, inventor, and author, Lovelock worked out of a barn-turned-laboratory he called his \"experimental station\" located in a wooded valley on the Devon\u2013Cornwall border in South West England.[29]/nIn 1988 he made an extended appearance on the Channel 4 television programme After Dark, alongside Heathcote Williams and Petra Kelly, among others./nOn 8 May 2012, he appeared on the Radio Four series The Life Scientific, talking to Jim Al-Khalili about the Gaia hypothesis. On the programme, he mentioned how his ideas had been received by various people, including Jonathon Porritt. He also said how he had a claim for inventing the microwave oven. He later explained this claim in an interview with The Manchester Magazine. Lovelock said that he did create an instrument during his time studying causes of damage to living cells and tissue, which had, according to him, \"almost everything you would expect in an ordinary microwave oven\". He invented the instrument to heat frozen hamsters in a way that caused less suffering to the animals, as opposed to the traditional way, which involved putting red-hot spoons on the animals' chests to heat them. He believed that, at the time, nobody had gone that far and made an embodiment of an actual microwave oven.[30] However, he did not claim to have been the first person to have the idea of using microwaves for cooking.[13]/nAfter developing his electron capture detector, in the late 1960s, Lovelock was the first to detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the atmosphere.[22] He found a concentration of 60 parts per trillion of CFC-11 over Ireland and, in a partially self-funded research expedition in 1972, went on to measure the concentration of CFC-11 from the northern hemisphere to the Antarctic aboard the research vessel RRS\u00a0Shackleton.[23][32] He found the gas in each of the 50 air samples that he collected but, not realising that the breakdown of CFCs in the stratosphere would release chlorine that posed a threat to the ozone layer, concluded that the level of CFCs constituted \"no conceivable hazard\".[32] He later stated that he meant \"no conceivable toxic hazard\".[33]/nHowever, the experiment did provide the first useful data on the ubiquitous presence of CFCs in the atmosphere. The damage caused to the ozone layer by the photolysis of CFCs was later discovered by Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina. After hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock's results,[34] they embarked on research that resulted in the first published paper that suggested a link between stratospheric CFCs and ozone depletion in 1974 (for which Sherwood and Molina later shared the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Paul Crutzen).[35]/nDrawing from the research of Alfred C. Redfield and G. Evelyn Hutchinson, Lovelock first formulated the Gaia hypothesis in the 1960s resulting from his work for NASA concerned with detecting life on Mars[21] and his work with Royal Dutch Shell.[36] The hypothesis proposes that living and non-living parts of the Earth form a complex interacting system that can be thought of as a single organism.[37][38] Named after the Greek goddess Gaia at the suggestion of novelist William Golding,[39] the hypothesis postulates that the biosphere has a regulatory effect on the Earth's environment that acts to sustain life./nWhile the hypothesis was readily accepted by many in the environmentalist community, it has not been widely accepted within the scientific community as a whole. Among its most prominent critics were the evolutionary biologists Richard Dawkins, Ford Doolittle, and Stephen Jay Gould, a convergence of opinion among a trio whose views on other scientific matters often diverged. These (and other) critics have questioned how natural selection operating on individual organisms can lead to the evolution of planetary-scale homeostasis.[40][page\u00a0needed]/nIn response to this, Lovelock, together with Andrew Watson, published the computer model Daisyworld in 1983, which postulated a hypothetical planet orbiting a star whose radiant energy is slowly increasing or decreasing. In the non-biological case, the temperature of this planet simply tracks the energy received from the star. However, in the biological case, ecological competition between \"daisy\" species with different albedo values produces a homeostatic effect on global temperature. When energy received from the star is low, black daisies proliferate since they absorb a greater fraction of the heat, but when energy input is high, white daisies predominate since they reflect excess heat. As the white and black daisies have contrary effects on the planet's overall albedo and temperature, changes in their relative populations stabilise the planet's climate and keep the temperature within an optimal range despite fluctuations in energy from the star. Lovelock argued that Daisyworld, although a parable, illustrates how conventional natural selection operating on individual organisms can still produce planetary-scale homeostasis.[41]/nIn Lovelock's 2006 book, The Revenge of Gaia, he argued that the lack of respect humans have had for Gaia, through the damage done to rainforests and the reduction in planetary biodiversity, is testing Gaia's capacity to minimise the effects of the addition of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. This eliminates the planet's negative feedbacks and increases the likelihood of homeostatic positive feedback potential associated with runaway global warming. Similarly, the warming of the oceans is extending the oceanic thermocline layer of tropical oceans into the Arctic and Antarctic waters, preventing the rise of oceanic nutrients into the surface waters and eliminating the algal blooms of phytoplankton on which oceanic food chains depend. As phytoplankton and forests are the main ways in which Gaia draws down greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, taking it out of the atmosphere, the elimination of this environmental buffering will see, according to Lovelock, most of the Earth becoming uninhabitable for humans and other life-forms by the middle of this century, with a massive extension of tropical deserts. In 2012, Lovelock distanced himself from these conclusions, saying he had \"gone too far\" in describing the consequences of climate change over the next century in this book.[42]/nIn his 2009 book, The Vanishing Face of Gaia, he rejected scientific models that disagree with the findings that sea levels are rising and Arctic ice is melting faster than the models predict. He suggested that we may already have passed the tipping point of terrestrial climate resilience into a permanently hot state. Given these conditions, Lovelock expected that human civilisation would be hard-pressed to survive. He expected the change to be similar to the Paleocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum when the temperature of the Arctic Ocean was 23\u00a0\u00b0C.[43][44]/nLovelock became concerned about the threat of global warming from the greenhouse effect. In 2004 he broke with many fellow environmentalists by stating that \"only nuclear power can now halt global warming\".[45] In his view, nuclear energy is the only realistic alternative to fossil fuels that can both fulfil the large scale energy needs of humankind while also reducing greenhouse emissions.[46] He was an open member of Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy.[4]/nIn 2005, against the backdrop of renewed UK government interest in nuclear power, Lovelock again publicly announced his support for nuclear energy, stating, \"I am a Green, and I entreat my friends in the movement to drop their wrongheaded objection to nuclear energy\".[47] Although those interventions in the public debate on nuclear power were in the 21st century, his views on it were longstanding. In his 1988 book The Ages of Gaia, he stated:/nI have never regarded nuclear radiation or nuclear power as anything other than a normal and inevitable part of the environment. Our prokaryotic forebears evolved on a planet-sized lump of fallout from a star-sized nuclear explosion, a supernova that synthesised the elements that go to make our planet and ourselves.[48]/nIn The Revenge of Gaia (2006), where he put forward the concept of sustainable retreat, Lovelock wrote:/nA television interviewer once asked me, \"But what about nuclear waste? Will it not poison the whole biosphere and persist for millions of years?\" I knew this to be a nightmare fantasy wholly without substance in the real world... One of the striking things about places heavily contaminated by radioactive nuclides is the richness of their wildlife. This is true of the land around Chernobyl, the bomb test sites of the Pacific, and areas near the United States' Savannah River nuclear weapons plant of the Second World War. Wild plants and animals do not perceive radiation as dangerous, and any slight reduction it may cause in their lifespans is far less a hazard than is the presence of people and their pets... I find it sad, but all too human, that there are vast bureaucracies concerned about nuclear waste, huge organisations devoted to decommissioning power stations, but nothing comparable to deal with that truly malign waste, carbon dioxide.[49]/nIn 2019 Lovelock said he thought difficulties in getting nuclear power going again were due to propaganda, that \"the coal and oil business fight like mad to tell bad stories about nuclear\", and that \"the greens played along with it. There's bound to have been some corruption there \u2013 I'm sure that various green movements were paid some sums on the side to help with propaganda\".[50]/nWriting in the British newspaper The Independent in 2006, Lovelock argued that, as a result of global warming, \"billions of us will die and the few breeding pairs of people that survive will be in the Arctic where the climate remains tolerable\" by the end of the 21st century.[51] The same year he suggested that \"we have to keep in mind the awesome pace of change and realise how little time is left to act, and then each community and nation must find the best use of the resources they have to sustain civilisation for as long as they can.\"[51] He further predicted in 2007 that the temperature increase would leave much of the world's land uninhabitable and unsuitable for farming, with northerly migrations and new cities created in the Arctic; furthermore that much of Europe will have turned to desert and Britain will have become Europe's \"life-raft\" due to its stable temperature caused by being surrounded by the ocean.[52]  He was quoted in The Guardian in 2008 that 80% of humans will perish by 2100, and this climate change will last 100,000 years.[53]/nIn a 2010 interview with The Guardian newspaper, he said that democracy might have to be \"put on hold\" to prevent climate change.[54] He continued:/nEven the best democracies agree that when a major war approaches, democracy must be put on hold for the time being. I have a feeling that climate change may be an issue as severe as a war. It may be necessary to put democracy on hold for a while./nStatements from 2012 portrayed Lovelock as continuing his concern over global warming while at the same time criticising extremism and suggesting alternatives to oil, coal and the green solutions he did not support.[42]/nIn a 2012 interview aired on MSNBC, Lovelock stated that he had been \"alarmist\", using the words \"All right, I made a mistake,\" about the timing of climate change and noted the documentary An Inconvenient Truth and the book The Weather Makers as examples of the same kind of alarmism. Lovelock still believed the climate to be warming, although not at the rate of change he once thought; he admitted that he had been \"extrapolating too far.\" He believed that climate change is still happening, but it will be felt further in the future.[42] Of the claims \"the science is settled\" on global warming, he stated:[55]/nOne thing that being a scientist has taught me is that you can never be certain about anything. You never know the truth. You can only approach it and hope to get a bit nearer to it each time. You iterate towards the truth. You don't know it.[55]/nHe criticised environmentalists for treating global warming like a religion.[55]/nIt just so happens that the green religion is now taking over from the Christian religion./nI don't think people have noticed that, but it's got all the sort of terms that religions use ... The greens use guilt. That just shows how religious greens are. You can't win people round by saying they are guilty for putting (carbon dioxide) in the air.[55]/nIn this 2012 MSNBC article, Lovelock is quoted as saying:[42]/nThe problem is we don't know what the climate is doing. We thought we knew 20 years ago. That led to some alarmist books \u2013 mine included \u2013 because it looked clear-cut, but it hasn't happened./nThe climate is doing its usual tricks. There's nothing much really happening yet. We were supposed to be halfway toward a frying world now./nThe world has not warmed up very much since the millennium. Twelve years is a reasonable time ... it (the temperature) has stayed almost constant, whereas it should have been rising \u2013 carbon dioxide is rising, no question about that.[42]/nIn a follow-up interview also in 2012, Lovelock stated his support for natural gas; he favoured fracking as a low-polluting alternative to coal.[29][55] He opposed the concept of \"sustainable development\", where modern economies might be powered by wind turbines, calling it meaningless drivel.[55][56] He kept a poster of a wind turbine to remind himself how much he detested them.[29]/nIn Novacene (2019), Lovelock proposed that benevolent superintelligence may take over and save the ecosystem and stated that the machines would need to keep organic life around to keep the planet's temperature habitable for electronic life.[57] On the other hand, if instead life becomes entirely electronic, \"so be it: we played our part and newer, younger actors are already appearing on stage\".[58][page\u00a0needed]/nIn 2007, Lovelock and Chris Rapley proposed the construction of ocean pumps to pump water up from below the thermocline to \"fertilize algae in the surface waters and encourage them to bloom\".[59] The basic idea was to accelerate the transfer of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the ocean by increasing primary production and enhancing the export of organic carbon (as marine snow) to the deep ocean. A scheme similar to that proposed by Lovelock and Rapley was later developed independently by a commercial company.[60]/nThe proposal attracted widespread media attention[61][62][63][64] and criticism.[65][66][67] Commenting on the proposal, Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, a University of East Anglia researcher, said \"It doesn't make sense. There is absolutely no evidence that climate engineering options work or even go in the right direction. I'm astonished that they published this. Before any geoengineering is put to work a massive amount of research is needed \u2013 research which will take 20 to 30 years\".[61] Other researchers claimed that \"this scheme would bring water with high natural pCO2 levels (associated with the nutrients) back to the surface, potentially causing exhalation of CO2\".[67] Lovelock subsequently said that his proposal was intended to stimulate interest and that research would be the next step,[68] and several research studies were published in the wake of the original proposal.[69][70] However, these estimated that the scheme would require a huge number of pipes,[69] and that the main effect of the pipes may be on the land rather than in the ocean.[70]/nSustainable retreat is a concept developed by Lovelock to define the necessary changes to human settlement and dwelling at the global scale to adapt to global warming and prevent its expected negative consequences on humans.[71][page\u00a0needed]/nLovelock thought the time was past for sustainable development and that we had come to a time when development is no longer sustainable. Therefore, we needed to retreat. Lovelock stated the following to explain the concept:[72]/nRetreat, in his view, means it's time to start talking about changing where we live and how we get our food; about making plans for the migration of millions of people from low-lying regions like Bangladesh into Europe; about admitting that New Orleans is a goner and moving the people to cities better positioned for the future. Most of all, he says, it's about everybody \"absolutely doing their utmost to sustain civilization, so that it doesn't degenerate into Dark Ages, with warlords running things, which is a real danger. We could lose everything that way.\"/nThe concept of sustainable retreat emphasises a pattern of resource use that aims to meet human needs with lower levels or less environmentally harmful types of resources.[73]/nLovelock was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1974. His nomination reads:/nLovelock has made distinguished contributions to several diverse fields, including a study of the transmission of respiratory infection, and methods of air sterilisation; the role of Ca and other divalent ions in blood clotting; damage to various living cells by freezing, thawing and thermal shock and its prevention by the presence of neutral solutes; methods of freezing and thawing small live animals; methods for preparing sperm for artificial insemination, which have been of major economic importance./nHe has invented a family of ionisation detectors for gas chromatography.

In 2006 he received the Wollaston Medal, the Geological Society of London's highest award, whose previous recipients include Charles Darwin.[75] Lovelock was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for services to the study of the Science and Atmosphere in the 1990 New Year Honours and a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) for services to Global Environmental Science in the 2003 New Year Honours.[76][77]/nLovelock married Helen Hyslop in 1942. They had four children and remained married until her death in 1989 from multiple sclerosis.[14][9][86] He first met his second wife, Sandy, at the age of 69.[87] Lovelock stated of their relationship: \"[Y]ou would find the life of me and my wife Sandy to be an unusually happy one in simple beautiful but unpretentious surroundings.\"[88]/nLovelock turned 100 in July 2019.[89] He died at his home in Abbotsbury, Dorset,[7] on his 103rd birthday in 2022,[80] of complications related to a fall.[90]/nIn March 2012, the National Portrait Gallery[91] unveiled a new portrait of Lovelock by British artist Michael Gaskell, which was completed in 2011. The collection also has two photographic portraits by Nick Sinclair (1993) and Paul Tozer (1994).[91] The archive of the Royal Society of Arts has a 2009 image taken by Anne-Katrin Purkiss.[92] Lovelock agreed to sit for sculptor Jon Edgar in Devon during 2007, as part of the Environment Triptych (2008)[93][page\u00a0needed] along with heads of Mary Midgley and Richard Mabey.

In the 1940s she became the first person to successfully clone a mammalian cell in vitro, which allowed for more efficient means of creating pure strains of cells for study.[1][2] She also developed the first laboratory test to distinguish people with Alzheimer's disease and people predisposed to cancer.[3]/nSanford was born July 19, 1915, in Chicago, Illinois, to parents Alta Rache and William James Koontz. She was educated at North Shore Country Day School, a selective prep school in Winnetka, Illinois.[1][4] She then attended Wellesley College with her two sisters. She graduated from Wellesley with an undergraduate degree in 1937. After receiving her undergraduate degree, she then attended Brown University, where she pursued a master's and doctorate in biology. She studied under zoologist Arthur M. Banta, and graduated with a Ph.D in 1942. She was one of a small distinguished group of women who attended Brown University's graduate biology program in the 1940s.[1]/nSanford married Charles F. R. Mifflin in 1971. She died September 12, 2005, aged 90.[2]/nKatherine Sanford spent her first two postdoctoral years teaching biology. From 1941-1942 she taught biology, comparative anatomy, and immunology at Western College for Women in Oxford, Ohio and then moved to Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania from 1942-1943. Following her time as an instructor, Sanford joined Johns Hopkins School of Nursing in Baltimore, Maryland as assistant director of its science program. She held this position from 1943 to 1947.[3] After her brief interval in teaching, she joined the National Cancer Institute (NCI) cancer laboratory in 1947, where she spent close to 50 years, and the rest of her career, working as a cancer research scientist.[5][6]/nSanford began her career as a research scientist as part of the tissue culture section of the National Cancer Institute's Laboratory of Biology. It did not take her long to make an impact, as almost immediately after joining she made her largest discovery involving a method of cloning mammalian cancer cells in vitro.[5] She was recognized with this discovery with the Ross Harrison Fellowship Award.[3] In 1974 Sanford was appointed head of the cell physiology and oncogenesis section of the NCI's Laboratory of Biochemistry.[3] Following this in 1977, Sanford was further promoted to the head of the in-vitro carcinogenesis section of the Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology. From this position, which she held the rest of her career, she made two more iconic discoveries. In 1985, she designed a test that could recognized genetic predisposition for cancer. Building on this idea in the 90s, she created a test that could differentiate people with a genetic predisposition for cancer from those with Alzheimer's disease.[2] After a 49-year career with the NCI, Stanford officially retired in December 1995, but stayed one extra year to complete her research.[3]/nSanford was involved with various biology societies and associations over her career. She founding member of the American Association for Cancer Research.[7] She served on various AACR  committees during her career. Additionally, she was a member of the American Society for Cell Biology, the American Society of Human Genetics, the Tissue Culture Association, and the International Society for Cell Biology.[3] In total, Sanford served as a board director or as a committee member on 23 scientific associations during the course of her career.[8]/nStarting in 1947 Katherine Sanford began her research career with the National Cancer Institute. Working with Dr. Virginia Evans and a group of tissue-culture workers she became the first to successfully clone a mammalian cell in vitro. This allowed the advancement of research on metabolic and genetic features of the clone cell.[2] Prior to her discovery, tissue cultures had to be composed of multiple and various human body cells in order for them to survive and grow. Single cells separated out required the support of other cells in order to function and proliferate. Her research targeted isolated mammalian cells in vitro and finding ways to trigger malignant transformations and replication. She developed a method that could stimulate their propagation into identical descendants.[1][2] Her experimental procedure required 929 iterations to find a combination of environmental and cell conditions that induced cloning. Sanford developed micropipettes where single cells could be picked up and isolated from under the microscope and placed in a detailed microenvironment, where diffusion of cellular products was restricted to inside a small closed culture.[1] Her first success in duplicating an identical copy of a cell was with a mouse fibroblast. While her procedure was initial procedure was cumbersome and hard to duplicate, ultimately her cloning discovery paved the way for the production of pure cell lines and the culturing of viruses. Additionally, cloning allowed the development of new vaccines and advanced the study of stem cells.[1][3]/nLater in her career Sanford developed a cytogenetic assay test that could identify people with predispositions for Alzheimer's Disease and cancer. Her test required collecting, culturing, and testing skin fibroblasts or blood lymphocytes from the patients. The cell cultures were exposed to fluorescent light that damaged the DNA of the cells. Following this, they were treated with DNA repair inhibitors and compared for chromatid breaks. It was found that Alzheimer's and cancer patients had significantly more chromatid breaks under certain conditions, which allowed for the identification of these predispositions.[3] Her work on this material was published  in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 1996.[2]/nSanford has filed three patents for her work over her career. One of these, patented on June 12, 1990, has now expired. This patent was a process patent for detecting genetic susceptibility to cancer, involving the frequency of gaps and breaks in chromatid in metaphase skin fibroblasts. Two other patents are still active. These include a process patent approved on June 30, 1998 for the detection of Alzheimer disease using cultured cells, and a process patent approved on January 25, 2000 for identifying compounds that protect against fluorescent light and x-ray-induced DNA lesions.[9]/nIn 1954, seven years after joining the NCI, Sanford was recognized with Ross Harrison Fellowship Award for her method of cloning mammalian cells.[2] She was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society for In Vitro Biology in 1977,[7] and an honorary Doctor of Science degree from the Catholic University of America in 1988.[10]", "65028269": "Max Duane Summers (born 1939 in Ohio) is an American molecular biologist[1] and inventor,[2] known for his work on the Baculovirus Expression Vector System (BEVS).[3]/nSummers graduated in 1962 from Wilmington College with an A.B. in biology.

These drawings caught the attention of Arthur Shipley, who collected some of them which were eventually deposited into the National Portrait Gallery in London.[2]/nAround 1909, Lillie was recruited by Edward A. Wilson, chief scientist for the upcoming British Antarctic Expedition (1910\u20131913) led by Captain Robert Falcon Scott.  Lillie joined E. W. Nelson, the expedition's other biologist, at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Plymouth to prepare.[11] Lillie and the rest of the crew of the Terra Nova sailed from Cardiff, Wales, on 15 June 1910.  The destination was Antarctica, where Scott hoped to be the first to reach the South Pole. Described as a \"frail-looking 26-year-old whom Scott had doubted at the beginning,\"[2]:\u200a37\u200a Lillie soon came down with measles.[12]:\u200a29\u200a On 25 July, the Terra Nova stopped at the island of South Trinidad (now known as Trindade) off the coast of Brazil, and having recovered from the measles, Lillie went ashore to collect plants, of which 13 species turned out to be previously unknown from the island.[2]/nLillie was the biologist in charge of operations on board the Terra Nova, and collected marine samples by trawling, dredging, and tow-netting. Specimens were collected in waters off the coast of Brazil, the Falkland Islands, the Three Kings Islands, as well as the Ross Sea and McMurdo Sound.[13] With the help of others he collected deep sea organisms including sponges, worms, and fish. Captain Scott and assistant zoologist Apsley Cherry-Garrard both recalled Lillie was especially excited to find specimens of Cephalodiscus, a hemichordate that was rare at the time and whose ancestor was thought to be a link between vertebrates and invertebrates.[14]:\u200a569\u200a[15]:\u200a139\u200a Wilson wrote: \"trawling probably caused more excitement and interest in the ship than anything else... and the instant a catch came in-board Lillie was surrounded by an interested group of men, very anxious to see if any startling novelty had at last been dragged up from the bottom.\"[16]:\u200a405\u2013406\u200a Lillie gave popular lectures on evolution to the crew, which helped break the monotony.[16]:\u200a369\u200a He was also known for his caricatures of the crew, some of which were printed in the South Polar Times, the expedition's magazine.[2]/nLillie never went ashore in Antarctica, but explored other southern islands. He also paid special attention to whales and dolphins, recording all those seen from the ship. In October 1911 he visited the Whaling Station at Whangamumu, near the Bay of Islands, New Zealand, and in 1912 spent July to October in the same region on two floating factories belonging to the New Zealand Whaling Company.[13][c] In June 1911 he gave a lecture on whale natural history at the Philosophical Institute of Canterbury,[19] and published his observations after the expedition, describing a new species of dolphin: Lagenorhynchus wilsoni (now regarded as a taxonomic synonym of L. cruciger, the hourglass dolphin).[20][21]/nLillie was described by Cherry-Garrard's biographer Sara Wheeler as popular yet perhaps the most unconventional person on the expedition, deeply intellectual yet eccentric.[22]:\u200a150\u200a He believed in reincarnation, and claimed he had been a Persian and a Roman in previous lives.[2] His nicknames on board included \"Lithley, \"Lithi\", and \"Hercules\".[15]:\u200a47/nCaptain Scott, Wilson, and three other expedition members died in Antarctica in March 1912, after reaching South Pole.

He was the director of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom) fisheries laboratory in Lowestoft (1945\u20131958), now known as the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas). His classic book, The Fish Gate, published in 1943, paints a picture of the near-collapse of the British fishing industry through overfishing that occurred before both the First and the Second World Wars.[2]/nGodfrey Michael Graham was born in Manchester on 22 February 1898, the son of the Quaker writer John William Graham (1859\u20131932) and Margaret Brockbank. As a boy he loved the Lake District and the wildlife he encountered on his relation's Cumberland farm.[1] His outstanding interest at Bootham School in York was in natural history. During World War I he served in the Royal Navy and afterwards read Natural Science at King's College, Cambridge.[1] His professional career was spent as a scientific civil servant on the staff of the Fisheries Laboratory in Lowestoft. Here he could combine biological science with his experience and love of the sea, knowing that his research would be both practical and useful.[1] In 1927-28 Michael Graham was dispatched by the fisheries laboratory and spent a year surveying fish populations in Lake Victoria.[3] This survey represented the first ever systematic survey of one of Africa's great lakes and provides a unique baseline against which all subsequent changes can be compared./nGraham married Edith Meek in 1925, who had assisted Ministry staff in their investigation of pollution problems in the River Tyne and who was a daughter of Alexander Meek, one of the founders of the Dove Marine Laboratory, Cullercoats.[2] He designed his own home in Lowestoft, acquiring enough land on which to keep cattle and horses and so in a small way to indulge his lifelong interest in farming. He always had a touch of eccentricity, as witnessed by his habit of writing with quills fashioned from the feathers of his own geese, wearing a flowing cape with a specially made inside pocket big enough for a ministry file and riding his Arab horse around Lowestoft at night with rear-lights fitted to his riding hat and stirrups.[2]/nIn Lowestoft, Graham's work led him to be particularly concerned with the problem of overfishing. He was appointed Principal Naturalist in 1944 and Director of Fishery Investigations in 1945. He published several highly influential and thought-provoking books during this time, most notably The Fish Gate in 1943, Human Needs in 1951 and Sea Fisheries: Their Investigation in the United Kingdom in 1956. As Director of Fisheries to HM Government he was made CMG (Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George) in January 1954, he was also responsible for recruiting Ray Beverton and Sidney Holt whose treatise On the Dynamics of Exploited Fish Populations (1957) is dedicated to Graham and is widely regarded as the cornerstone of modern fisheries science.[4]/nDuring the Second World War, Michael Graham was engaged on operational research in the RAF, for which he was awarded the OBE (Order of the British Empire).[1] He retired in 1958 to devote himself to reclaiming derelict land in south Lancashire, and successfully demonstrated a practical and economic way of 'greening over' post-industrial slag heaps. From 1966 to 1971 he was a visiting Lecturer in the Department of Biology at Salford University, and to his great joy the Department adopted and continued his work of land reclamation. Michael Graham did not live to see his last book A Natural Ecology (1973) published; he died on New Year's Day 1972 at the age of 72.[1]/nLake Victoria has witnessed many dramatic changes over the past Century as a result of the introduction of Nile Perch, eutrophication and climatic change. These influences have in-turn resulted in major alteration to indigenous fish communities.[5] In 1927 Michael Graham was sent from the fisheries laboratory in Lowestoft to spend a year surveying fish populations and fisheries in Lake Nyanza (Lake Victoria) on behalf of the Colonial Office.[3] This unique survey represents the first ever characterisation of Lake Victoria fish communities.[5]/nThe original hand-written 'Naturalists Logbooks' from this survey have recently been re-discovered in the archive of the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), these are now being digitized and made available to researchers seeking a 'baseline' against which subsequent changes can be compared./nDuring his survey of Lake Victoria, Michael Graham  recorded fifty-eight species of Haplochromis including many new species, and commented that \"the number of individuals is almost incredible!\".[3] While Graham regretted that the enormous haplochromine population was not really 'useful', he warned against introduction of a large predator that could convert these little, bony fish \u2013 which the colonial fisheries officers called trash fish \u2013 into large fish that could be caught for food. The leading candidate at that time was the Nile perch, which was tasty, grew to over six feet (about 2 metres) and two hundred pounds (a hundred kilograms), and already lived in nearby Lake Albert. At the time Graham wrote \"The introduction of a large predatory species from another area would be attended with the upmost danger, unless preceded by extensive research into the probable effects of this operation\". In a footnote he added that his warning had just been strengthened by a recent research report from Lake Albert, which described how rare the tilapia had become.[3]/nSurvey catches included several Haplochromis species that are now thought to be extinct, including: Haplochromis flavipinnis, Haplochromis gowersii, Haplochromis longirostris, Haplochromis macrognathus, Haplochromis michaeli, Haplochromis nigrescens, Haplochromis prognathus. The specific name Haplochromis michaeli honours Michael Graham as the collector of the type specimen.[6]/nOn 13 December 1928, Certificates of recommendation were received by the Linnean Society for election of Michael Graham to Fellowship status. Michael Graham read his paper on \"The Natural History of the Victoria Nyanza\", at the Linnean Society on 24 May 1929.[7]/nMichael Graham's given task on joining the Lowestoft laboratory was to study the North Sea cod fishery. He continued, with breaks for field studies in Africa and Canada, throughout the 1920s and 1930s, describing the cod's life cycle and spawning grounds, and showing the age composition of the fishery through a laborious process of scale-reading. In a 1935 paper Graham conclusively showed that the North Sea stock was overfished.[8] His classic book, The Fish Gate[9] reminds us that by 1939 the North Sea was exhausted and many fishermen were unemployed \u2013 the inevitable result of unrestrained over-fishing./nThe problem, according to Michael Graham, was that as soon as fishermen began fishing, stocks started to decline. To compensate, fishermen bought bigger nets and engines, but after a certain point, profits would slide. Graham thought the solution was to regulate fishing so that only larger, older fish could be caught. Graham distilled the observations of 20 years at sea into his Great Law of Fishing, a simple declarative statement such that \"Fisheries that are unlimited become unprofitable\".[9]  Graham said this was a law demonstrable by experience, not scientific theory (although this was later proven mathematically by Beverton and Holt). As long as the effort is free and urged on by competition, fisheries will eventually fail. The Great Law, he pointed out, was only fruitful in its inverse form \"that limiting effort will restore profit to a fishery\". While some thought that fishermen needed to conserve stocks so their sons could fish, Graham believed fishermen had to change the way they fished so they themselves could continue to make a living.[9]/nTo a later generation, trying to explain why the North Sea and other seas declined and their fishing ports collapsed, Graham is a seminal figure, both for his influence on the 'golden age' of fisheries science and for his restless advocacy of 'rational' fishing and the conservation of biological systems on which humans depend for food./nThe Fish Gate is notable for citing Das Kapital by Karl Marx in the context of the growing industrialisation of the fishing industry.[9]/nThe MAFF \u2013 Directorate of Fisheries (now Cefas) has been an affiliated institute of the University of East Anglia (UEA) since 1965. In 1974, staff at the Lowestoft laboratory created an endowment called The Michael Graham Prize, funded through royalties received from sale of the book Sea Fisheries Research.[10]  This book had been written by members of the laboratory as a tribute to their esteemed former Director who had died in 1972.[2]/nThree prizes of \u00a3100 each, now collectively known as the Michael Graham Prizes, are awarded annually to students in the Faculty of Science at the University of East Anglia, one for best performance in the Ecology degree, one for best performance in the MSc in Applied Ecology and Conservation and one for the best conservation project by an undergraduate student from either ENV (School of Environmental Sciences) or BIO (School of Biological Sciences).[11]", "40157397": "Alison Woollard (born 1968) is a British biologist.

Wolfgang Schnell (* 18 May 1913 in Bad Oeynhausen; \u2020 29 December 2006 in Stuttgart) was a German professor of applied genetics and plant breeding. He belonged to the most prominent scientists in his field during the second half of the 20th century./nF. Wolfgang Schnell attended high school (Gymnasium) in Celle, Halle, and Leipzig. After having passed the final examinations (Abitur) in 1931 he served his apprenticeship in agriculture on a farm near Hamburg (1932\u20131934). Thereafter he studied agricultural sciences in Berlin, Munich, and G\u00f6ttingen (1935\u20131939). Military service (1939\u20131945), the last part of the war as SS-Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer  (SS-Nr. 214750, NSDAP Nr. 4139669) in the Waffen-SS, he became commander of the schwere SS-Artillerie Abteilung 503, attached to the III.(Germ.) SS-Panzer Korps. and his captivity with automatic arrest for SS-Soldiers/Officers lasted to 1948 interrupted his scientific career for almost ten years. In 1949 he received a doctoral degree in agricultural economics at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. He then changed the subject and attended a two-year training course in plant breeding at the Max-Planck-Institute (MPIZ) in Voldagsen (later Cologne). In 1952 he got an appointment at an MPIZ branch station in Scharnhorst close to Hannover. There he was responsible for the cross-pollinated cereals maize (Zea mays) and rye (Secale cereale). He focussed upon the general principles of plant breeding methodology and the genetic foundations of heterosis. In 1958 he spent six months at the North Carolina State University in Raleigh (hosted by CC Cockerham, RE Comstock, and HF Robinson) and visited several other leading US universities. These visits greatly stimulated his research since he became acquainted with cutting edge research in statistics, quantitative genetics, and breeding methodology. Five years later, he earned his Habilitation degree at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, qualifying him to work as a university professor. In the same year (1963) he was appointed full professor and director of the newly established Institute of Plant Breeding at the University of Hohenheim (Stuttgart, Germany). There he headed the Chair of Applied Genetics and Plant Breeding until his retirement in 1981. During most of this time he also acted as director, later as a major scientific advisor, of the Hohenheim State Plant Breeding Institute (Landessaatzuchtanstalt)./nAlready Schnell's early  research at Scharnhorst received great national and international recognition. He significantly contributed to progress in the biometrical, population genetic, and quantitative genetic foundations of modern plant breeding. His greatest achievements were an extension of the linkage theory to an arbitrary number of loci and the derivation of formulae for the genetic covariance between relatives in the presence of arbitrary linkage and epistasis. The genuine impact of these two breakthroughs only became apparent about five decades later with the advent of affordable high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies. In addition, Schnell extended the theory of selection for quantitative traits to multiple stages and developed models for assessing the influence of epistasis on heterosis. Last but not least, he modernized the design and analysis of plant breeding field experiments by implementing new statistical tools and electronic data processing technologies./nSchnell's breeding activities were mainly directed to the two open-pollinated cereals rye and maize. In rye he started a systematic search for cytoplasmic male sterility in backcross generations of crosses between European and exotic rye accessions. This program was continued by HH Geiger and in 1984 lead to the first listed hybrid rye varieties worldwide. In maize Schnell developed early-maturing flint and dent line gene pools and in 1965 released the first German double-cross hybrid 'Velox' (FAO 210)./nAt the University of Hohenheim Schnell focused on the development of  a comprehensive theory of plant breeding. Major research topics of his group included/nAll theoretical studies were accompanied by extensive field experiments, many of which were conducted in collaboration with breeding companies./nAfter his retirement (1981) Schnell concentrated his research on the development of a unified quantitative genetic theory of heterosis. In several papers and scientific talks he made valuable contributions to this topic. In one of his last papers (together with C.C. Cockerham, Genetics 1992) he clarified the influence of multiplicative gene action versus other types of epistasis in heterosis./nSchnell excelled in intellectual power, clear research concepts, and a strong mission towards promoting plant breeding. His creative power resulted from his enthusiasm for gaining scientific knowledge and for developing superior breeding strategies. He once compared his scientific enthusiasm with a stampeder\u2019s frenetic search for gold./nWhen Schnell was appointed professor of Applied Genetics and Plant Breeding at Hohenheim, no adequate course program existed in this field. During the first years of his employment he therefore spent most of his energy on developing an up-to-date teaching program covering all relevant basic and applied areas. According to his research interests he put particular emphasis on the theoretical foundations and the general principles of plant breeding. He classified the breeding methods into four breeding categories viz. line, population, hybrid, and clone breeding. These categories are unambiguously defined by the reproductive characteristics and the genetic structure of the resulting varieties as well as by the mode of reproduction of the respective species. This classification system proved highly useful not only in teaching but also in research. In the course of time the system was adopted by many colleagues in Germany and abroad./nSchnell also built up first courses in biometry and population genetics. To strengthen these subjects, the University of Hohenheim followed his proposal to install a new chair for each of these fields (1971). Thereby Hohenheim became one of the most attractive places for studying plant breeding in Germany. Furthermore, he suggested a fundamental reform of the study course in Agricultural Sciences and, together with D Fewson (animal breeding), he initiated a new study course in Agricultural Biology./nSchnell mentored 26 Ph.D. students, many of whom reached leading positions in research institutions and breeding companies.", "13582573": "George Klein (Georg Klein; born Klein Gy\u00f6rgy, 28 July 1925\u00a0\u2013 10 December 2016) was a Hungarian\u2013Swedish microbiologist and public intellectual.[1] Specializing in cancer research, he was professor of tumour biology at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm from 1957 to 1992, a chair created for him,[1] and as professor emeritus continued to work as research group leader in the microbiology and tumor biology center.[2][3] According to Nature, the department Klein founded was \"international and influential\".[1] In the 1960s he and his wife, Eva Klein, \"laid the foundation for modern tumour immunology\".[4]/nIn addition to having over 1,385 papers published on cancer and experimental cell research, Klein authored over 13 books in Swedish on a wide range of topics, including essays on the Holocaust in Hungary.[2] In 1944 he escaped from being loaded onto a train in Budapest during the deportation of Jews to the Auschwitz concentration camp.[5]/nThree of Klein's books have been translated into English: The Atheist and the Holy City (1990); Piet\u00e0 (1992), a collection of essays on whether life is worth living; and Live Now (1997).

Between May and July 1944, 437,000 Hungarian Jews were deported by cattle train to the Auschwitz concentration camp, to be \"resettled\", according to the Germans. Most were, in fact, sent to the gas chambers./nIn May or June 1944, Klein was working as a junior secretary for the Jewish Council in Sip Street, Budapest, when he was shown a copy of the Vrba-Wetzler report by his boss, Dr. Zolt\u00e1n Kohn. The report was an eyewitness account of what was happening in Auschwitz, including details about the gas chambers. The authors, Rudolf Vrba and Alfr\u00e9d Wetzler, had escaped from the camp in April that year. They warned that most of the deportees arriving at the camp were being killed, not resettled.[7]/nKlein tried to warn his family and friends, but no one would listen. When the time came for him to board one of the trains, he ran instead, and ended up hiding in a cellar until January 1945.[7] Decades later, he looked for Vrba, then a professor of pharmacology in Canada, to thank him, and subsequently wrote about him and his report in two essays: \"The Ultimate Fear of the Traveler Returning from Hell\" in Piet\u00e0 (first published in Sweden in 1989), and \"Confronting the Holocaust: An Eyewitness Account\" (2011) in The Auschwitz Reports and the Holocaust in Hungary, edited by Randolph L. Braham and William vanden Heuvel./nWhen the war ended, Klein and a friend traveled to Szeged, a town 300\u00a0km from Budapest, to find out whether its university was still functioning. Budapest's university, then known as the P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny P\u00e9ter University, was deserted. They walked part of the way and hitched rides, arriving in Szeged on 4 February 1945. The University of Szeged was still functioning, and Klein was admitted as a student. He studied medicine there for three months before continuing his studies in Budapest.[8]/nKlein worked as an instructor in histology and pathology[2] from 1945 to 1947 at the P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny P\u00e9ter University; it was while working there, in July 1947, that he met his future wife, Eva Fischer.[9] Shortly after meeting her, he and a group of students were invited by a Jewish student club in Sweden to visit Stockholm and Gothenburg, where Klein was introduced to the Karolinska Institute. After talking to Torbj\u00f6rn Caspersson, he was offered a job there as a research assistant.[10][11] He returned to Budapest in September 1947 and married Eva, who joined him in Stockholm in March 1948,[12] shortly before the Hungarian People's Republic came into existence.[1]/nKlein completed his M.D. at the Karolinska Institute in 1951 and held the position of assistant professor of cell research from 1951 to 1957.[2] Eva Klein completed her M.D., also at the Karolinska Institute, in 1955.[13] In 1957 Klein was promoted to professor of tumor biology, a chair created for him, and he and his wife created the Department of Tumour Biology, with a donation from a Swedish charity, Riksf\u00f6reningen mot cancer.[4] Klein led the department until 1993, after which he was its research group leader.[2]/nIn 1960 the Kleins published an important paper in Cancer Research, \"Demonstration of Resistance against Methylcholanthrene-induced Sarcomas in the Primary Autochthonous Host\".[14] The paper showed, as Pramod K. Srivastava wrote, \"that tumors could elicit protective immunity against themselves in syngenic hosts, and that such immunity was specific to the individual tumor\".[15] According to Klein's obituary in Nature, researchers at the time believed that cancers carried \"a common antigen that the immune system could recognize. The Kleins and their colleagues used a chemical carcinogen to induce tumours in mice, surgically removed these and immunized the animals with irradiated cells from their own tumours. Next, the group inoculated mice with viable cancer cells and demonstrated that the immune system would only reject cancerous cells if they came from the original tumour. This clarified the field: the immune system could recognize and reject cancers, in a way that was specific to each individual.\"[1]/nKlein later made a connection between the Epstein-Barr virus and lymphomas and other cancers.[16] He was responsible, with Henry Harris, for establishing the \"phenomenon of tumour suppression\u00a0... using the technique of somatic cell hydridization\".[17]/nGeorge and Eva Klein had three children together: a son who is a mathematician, and two daughters, one of whom is a medical doctor and the other a playwright.[18] The couple described the beginning of their careers and how they met, in an article they wrote together in 1989, \"How One Thing has Led to Another\".[19] Klein died on 10 December 2016 at the age of 91.[20]/nKlein was the recipient of many awards and honorary doctorates for his research and literary contributions.[2] In November 2003 Sveriges Television broadcast a documentary about him, Georg Klein, by Ulf von Strauss.[21] He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1967),[22] the United States National Academy of Sciences (1973),[23] and the American Philosophical Society (1979).[24] His awards included:[2]/n/nKlein published over 1,385 papers and 13 books,[2] including:", "66928880": "Frank Bacchus Johnson (1919\u20132005) was an African American chemical pathologist of the 20th century./nJohnson was born on February 1, 1919, in Washington, District of Columbia, United States of America.

During that time, he was able to get a freeze drying apparatus (he had worked with inventor of the device, Isadore Gersh, while at the University of Illinois, Chicago) needed for research projects operational. The ten day temporary duty became his career after General Elbert DeCoursey, AFIP Director, asked him if he wanted to stay.[1]/nJohnson was instrumental in acquiring the AFIP's first electron microscopes and ultracentrifuges in the mid-1950s, giving institute pathologists the ability to see further into the interior cellular structure than was possible with optical microscopes.

He is the Charles Howard Candler Professor of Primate Behavior in the Department of Psychology at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, director of the Living Links Center at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory,[1] and author of numerous books including Chimpanzee Politics (1982) and Our Inner Ape (2005). His research centers on primate social behavior, including conflict resolution, cooperation, inequity aversion, and food-sharing. He is a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences and the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences./nDe Waal was born in 's-Hertogenbosch on October 29, 1948.[2] He studied at the Dutch universities of Radboud University Nijmegen, University of Groningen, and Utrecht. In 1977, De Waal received his doctorate in biology from Utrecht University after training as a zoologist and ethologist with professor Jan van Hooff, a well-known expert of emotional facial expressions in primates. His dissertation titled: \"Agonistic interactions and relations among Java-monkeys\" concerned aggressive behavior and alliance formation in macaques.[2][3] Fellow Dutch ethologist Niko Tinbergen was an inspiration to de Waal.[4]/nAtheism will need to be combined with something else, something more constructive than its opposition to religion, to be relevant to our lives. The only possibility is to embrace morality as natural to our species./n\u2014 from The Bonobo and the Atheist (2013)/nIn 1975, De Waal began a six-year project on the world's largest captive colony of chimpanzees at the Arnhem Zoo.  The study resulted in many scientific papers, and resulted in publication of his first book, Chimpanzee Politics, in 1982. This book offered the first description of primate behavior explicitly in terms of planned social strategies. De Waal was first to introduce the thinking of Machiavelli to primatology, leading to the label \"Machiavellian Intelligence\" that later became associated with it. In his writings, De Waal has never shied away from attributing emotions and intentions to his primates, and as such his work inspired the field of primate cognition that, three decades later, flourishes around themes of cooperation, altruism, and fairness./nHis early work also drew attention to deception and conflict resolution, nowadays two major areas of research. Initially, all of this was highly controversial. Thus, the label of \"reconciliation\", which De Waal introduced for reunions after fights, was questioned at first, but is now fully accepted with respect to animal behavior. Recently, De Waal's work has emphasized non-human animal empathy and even the origins of morality. His most widely cited paper,[5] written with his former student Stephanie Preston, concerns the evolutionary origin and neuroscience of empathy, not just in primates, but in mammals in general./nDe Waal's name is also associated with bonobos, the \"make love \u2013 not war\" primates that he has made popular. But even his bonobo studies are secondary to the larger goal of understanding what binds primate societies together rather than how competition structures them./nBeing both more systematically brutal than chimps and more empathic than bonobos, we are by far the most bipolar ape. Our societies are never completely peaceful, never completely competitive, never ruled by sheer selfishness, and never perfectly moral./n\u2014 Frans de Waal[6]/nCompetition is not ignored in his work: the original focus of de Waal's research, before he was well known, was aggressive behavior and social dominance. Whereas his science focuses on the behavior of nonhuman primates (mostly chimpanzees, bonobos, macaques, and capuchin monkeys), his popular books have given de Waal worldwide visibility by relating the insights he has gained from monkey and ape behavior to human society. With his students, he has also worked on elephants, which are increasingly featured in his writings./nHis research into the innate capacity for empathy among primates has led De Waal to the conclusion that non-human great apes and humans are simply different types of apes, and that empathic and cooperative tendencies are continuous between these species. His belief is illustrated in the following quote from The Age of Empathy: \"We start out postulating sharp boundaries, such as between humans and apes, or between apes and monkeys, but are in fact dealing with sand castles that lose much of their structure when the sea of knowledge washes over them. They turn into hills, leveled ever more, until we are back to where evolutionary theory always leads us: a gently sloping beach.\"/nThis is quite opposite to the view of some economists and anthropologists, who postulate the differences between humans and other animals. However, recent work on prosocial tendencies in apes and monkeys supports de Waal's position. See, for example, the research of Felix Warneken,[7] a psychologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. In 2011, de Waal and his co-workers were the first to report that chimpanzees given a free choice between helping only themselves or helping themselves plus a partner, prefer the latter. In fact, de Waal does not believe these tendencies to be restricted to humans and apes, but views empathy and sympathy as universal mammalian characteristics, a view that over the past decade has gained support from studies on rodents and other mammals, such as dogs. He and his students have extensively worked on such cooperation and fairness in animals. In 2011 de Waal gave a TED Talk entitled \"Moral behavior in animals\".[8] Part of the talk dealt with inequity aversion among capuchin monkeys, and a video extract of this went viral. It showed the furious reaction of one monkey given a less desirable treat than another.[9] The most recent work in this area was the first demonstration that given a chance to play the Ultimatum game, chimpanzees respond in the same way as children and human adults by preferring the equitable outcome.[10]/nIn 1981, de Waal moved to the United States for a position at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, and in 1991 took a position at Emory University, in Atlanta, Georgia. He is currently C.H. Candler Professor in the Psychology Department at Emory University and director of the Living Links Center at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory. He became an American citizen in 2008./nThe possibility that empathy resides in parts of the brain so ancient that we share them with rats should give pause to anyone comparing politicians with those poor, underestimated creatures./n\u2014Frans de Waal[11]/nIn 2009 he coined the term Veneer theory.[12] His 2013 book The Bonobo and the Atheist examines human behavior through the eyes of a primatologist, and explores to what extent God and religion are needed for human morality. The main conclusion is that morality comes from within, and is part of human nature. The role of religion is secondary.[13]/nDe Waal also writes a column for Psychologie Magazine, a popular Dutch monthly.[14]/nSince September 1, 2013, de Waal has been a distinguished professor (universiteitshoogleraar) at Utrecht University. This is a part-time appointment\u2014he remains in his position at Emory University, in Atlanta.[2][15]/nIn October 2016, de Waal was the guest on the BBC Radio Four program The Life Scientific.[16]/nIn June 2018, de Waal was awarded the NAT Award, recently established by the Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona. The award, which goes to people or institutions \"that are referents for their way of viewing and explaining nature, whether because they have encouraged professional engagement in natural history disciplines or because they have contributed significantly to nature conservation\", was awarded to de Waal \"for his vision regarding the evolution of animal behaviour in establishing a parallel between primate and human behaviour in aspects such as politics, empathy, morality and justice.\" Alongside de Waal, broadcaster and naturalist David Attenborough was awarded an Extraordinary Award for a Professional Career, and biologist and former director of the Barcelona Zoology Museum Roser Nos Ronchera was awarded a Honorable Mention.[17]", "62767360": "Noazesh Ahmed (1 February 1935 \u2013 24 November 2009) was a Bangladeshi geneticist and photographer.[1][2][3]/nAhmed was born on 1 February 1935 in Paril Nowadha, Singair Upazila, Manikganj District, East Bengal, British India.

He is considered to invent the term neo-Darwinism, which in the late 19th century was considered as a theory of evolution that focuses on natural selection as the main evolutionary force.[2] However, Samuel Butler used this term with a similar meaning in 1880.[3] Romanes' early death was a loss to the cause of evolutionary biology in Britain. Within six years Mendel's work was rediscovered, and a whole new agenda opened up for debate./nGeorge Romanes was born in Kingston, Canada West (now Ontario), in 1848, the youngest of three children, all boys, in a well-to-do and intellectually cultivated family.  His father was Rev George Romanes (1805\u20131871), a Scottish Presbyterian minister.  Two years after his birth, his parents moved to Cornwall Terrace in London, United Kingdom, which would set Romanes on the path to a fruitful and lasting relationship with Charles Darwin. During his youth, Romanes resided temporarily in Germany and Italy, developing a fluency in both German and Italian. His early education was inconsistent, undertaken partly in public schools, and partly at home. He developed an early love for poetry and music, at which he excelled.  However, his true passion resided elsewhere, and the young Romanes decided to study science, abandoning a prior ambition to become a clergyman like his father./nAlthough he came from an educated home, his school education was erratic. He entered university half-educated and with little knowledge of the ways of the world.[4] He studied medicine and physiology, graduating from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge with the degree of BA in 1871,[5] and is commemorated there by a stained glass window in the chapel./nIt was at Cambridge that he came first to the attention of Charles Darwin: \"How glad I am that you are so young!\" said Darwin. \n[4] Forging a relationship with Darwin was not difficult for Romanes, who reputedly inherited a \"sweetness of temper and calmness of manner\" from his father. The two remained friends for life. Guided by Michael Foster, Romanes continued to work on the physiology of invertebrates at University College London under William Sharpey and Burdon-Sanderson. In 1879, at 31, Romanes was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on the basis of his work on the nervous systems of medusae. However, Romanes' tendency to support his claims by anecdotal evidence rather than empirical tests prompted Lloyd Morgan's warning known as Morgan's Canon:/nAs a young man, Romanes was a Christian, and some, including his religious wife, later said that he regained some of that belief during his final illness.[7] In fact, he became an agnostic due to the influence of Darwin.[8] In a manuscript left unfinished at the end of his life he said that the theory of evolution had caused him to abandon religion.[9]/nRomanes founded a series of free public lectures, the Romanes Lectures, which continue to this day. He was a friend of Thomas Henry Huxley, who gave the second Romanes lecture./nTowards the end of his life, he returned to Christianity.[10]/nHe died in Oxford on 23 May 1894. A memorial to Romanes exists in the north west corner of Greyfriars Kirkyard in Edinburgh on the grave of his parents./nRomanes's and Darwin's relationship developed quickly and they became close friends. This relationship began when Romanes became Darwin's research assistant during the last eight years of Darwin's life. The association Romanes had with Darwin was essential in Darwin's later works. Therefore, Darwin confided volumes of unpublished work which Romanes later used to publish papers. Like Darwin, Romanes's theories were met with scepticism and were not accepted initially.[4] The majority of Romanes's work attempted to make a connection between animal consciousness and human consciousness. Some problems were encountered during his research that he addressed with the development of physiological selection. This was Romanes's answer to three objections to Darwin's isolation theory of speciation. These were: species characteristics that have no evolutionary purpose; the widespread fact of inter-specific sterility; and the need for varieties to escape the swamping effects of inter-crossing after permanent species are established. At the end of his career the majority of his work was directed towards the development of a relationship between intelligence and placement on an evolutionary tree.[11] Romanes believed that the further along an organism was on an evolutionary standpoint, the more likely that organism would be to possess a higher level of functioning./nRomanes was the last child born of three children from George Romanes and Isabella Cair Smith. The majority of his immediate and extended family were descendant from Scottish Highland tribes. His father, Reverend George Romanes, was a professor at Queens College in Kingston, Canada and taught Greek at the local university until the family moved back to England. Romanes and his wife Ethel Mary Duncan were married on 11 February 1879. They were happily married and studied together. Romanes was said to be an \"ideal father\" to their six children.[12] Both Romanes' mother and father were involved in the Protestant and Anglican Church during his childhood. Romanes was baptised Anglican and was heavily involved with the Anglican teachings during his youth, despite the fact his parents were not heavily involved with any religion.[13]/nIt is speculated that Darwin may have been viewed as a father figure to Romanes. Darwin did not agree with the teachings of the Catholic Church because the fundamental teachings were not supported by his scientific findings at the time. This could explain Romanes' conversion to agnosticism.[13]/nWhen Romanes attended Gonville and Caius College Cambridge, he entered into an essay contest on the topic of \"Christian Prayer considered in relation to the belief that Almighty governs the world by general laws\".[14] Romanes did not have much hope in winning, but much to his surprise he took first place in this contest and received the Burney prize. After winning the Burney prize, Romanes came to the conclusion that he could no longer be faithful to his Christian religion due to his love and commitment for science. This is interesting due to the fact that when Romanes was growing up, his father was a Reverend. Therefore, Romanes went into great detail about religion and how all aspects of the mind need to be involved to be faithfully committed to religion in his book Thoughts on Religion. He believed that you had to have an extremely high level of will to be dedicated to God or Christ.[15] He had earlier published a book on the subject in general called A Candid Examination of Theism, where he concluded that God's existence was not supported by the evidence, but stated his unhappiness with the fact.[16]/nRomanes tackled the subject of evolution frequently. For the most part he supported Darwinism and the role of natural selection. However, he perceived three problems with Darwinian evolution:[17]/nRomanes' own solution to this was called 'physiological selection'. His idea was that variation in reproductive ability, caused mainly by the prevention of inter-crossing with parental forms, was the primary driving force in the production of new species.[18] The majority view then (and now) was that geographical separation is the primary force in species splitting (or allopatry) and secondarily was the increased sterility of crosses between incipient species./nTaking influence from Darwin, Romanes was a proponent of both natural selection and the inheritance of acquired characteristics. The latter was denied by Alfred Russel Wallace, a strict selectionist.[19] Romanes came into a dispute with Wallace over the definition of Darwinism.[20]/nWhen Charles Darwin died, Romanes defended Darwin's theories by attempting to rebut criticisms and attacks levied by other psychologists against the Darwinian school of thought. Romanes expanded on Darwin's theories of evolution and natural selection by advancing a theory of behaviour based on comparative psychology. In Animal Intelligence, Romanes demonstrated similarities and dissimilarities between cognitive and physical functions of various animals.[21] In Mental Evolution in Animals, Romanes illustrated the evolution of the cognitive and physical functions associated with animal life. Romanes believed that animal intelligence evolves through behavioural conditioning, or positive reinforcement.[22] Romanes then published Mental Evolution in Man, which focused on the evolution of human cognitive and physical functions.[23]/nIn 1890, Romanes published  Darwin, and After Darwin,[24] where he attempted to explain the relationship between science and religion.

He is known for his research at Oxford University on polyploidy, cloning, nuclear transfer and later for his many other researches such as the discovery of \"ringed polysome figures\" and on theories on gene expression changes with evolution and environment.[1] In recognition of his contributions, he was awarded the Sir Dorabji Tata Medal, nominated as a fellow of Indian National Science Academy, Honorary Chief Wild Life Warden of the State of Madhya Pradesh and was the vice-chancellor of Jiwaji University,[2] Gwalior until his death./nHar Swarup was born in village Biaora, District Rajgarh in Madhya Pradesh, India in an illustrious family, his father being Late Shyam Behari Lal, a commissioner of taxes in Rajgarh State and grand father the late Devi Prasad, an architect who had in the beginning of the century migrated to central India to design Taj-ul-Masajid (one of the largest mosques in Asia) on a request by Nawab Shah Jahan Begum (1868\u20131901) ruler of Bhopal. Recognizing his rare brilliance even during his primary education in the pre-independent India, Har Swarup at a young age was sent to Agra and abroad to UK for further studies. He achieved academic distinction in High School Certificate Examination, went on to secure first position both in BSc (1944) and MSc (1946) examinations respectively from Agra University. During his university years, apart from playing first class cricket[3] he actively participated in the freedom movement having met Mahatma Gandhi who influenced him immensely to spearhead the Agra University students movement in the aftermath of the Quit India Resolution at Wardha in 1942. It was again on the advice of Mahatma Gandhi to further the cause of higher education in the country that he joined as a lecturer at D.A.V College in Kanpur in 1946 and subsequently at Sagar in Madhya Pradesh where he completed his doctorate in 1953[4] while also helping Sir Hari Singh Gaur in setting up the first university of the State at Sagar in Madhya Bharat (now Madhya Pradesh). Har Swarup went to England on a GOI-Rhodes Scholarship in 1955 to be awarded a D Phil at Oxford and opted to return to newly independent India despite several offers abroad, to become one of the youngest university professors in India./nIn England he worked with Professor Michael Fischberg for his D Phil at University of Oxford along with John Bertrand Gurdon to do pioneering research on nuclear transplantation and cloning,[5] that now are recognised for potential stem cell and other medical applications. In his path breaking research he could induce successful nuclear transplantation and polyploidy in fish Stickleback, Gasterosteus aculatus, that was reported in the prestigious scientific journal Nature.[6] Prof. John Bertrand Gurdon used the same technique on the frog, Xenopus under Prof Michael Fischberg at Oxford and was later awarded the Nobel Prize in 2012 for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent.[7] It was the pioneering work to induce polyploidy and the successful cloning of fish and frog respectively by Dr H. Swarup and Dr J. Gurdon using intact nuclei from the somatic cells as an extension of the work of Briggs and King in 1952 on transplanting nuclei from the embryonic blastula cells that was then internationally acclaimed.[8] The  British Scientist, Dr. J.B.S. Haldane hailed the work of Dr Har Swarup for its potential medical applications and in describing the results, became one of the first to use the word \"clone\" in reference to animals. Once Dr. Haldane wrote to Prof. Hickling who was looking for a cytogeneticist that Dr Har Swarup was the best cytogenetist he could get in whole of England.[citation needed] His simple technique for production of polyploidy by hot and cold shock made him so famous that he was invited to demonstrate it at several places like Oxford and Cambridge Universities, and at the then recently set up Marine Biological Station at Plymouth. Sir Ronald Fisher and Professor C.D. Darlington made special mention of Professor Swarup's technique at International Genetical Conference at Oxford to be later invited by Hamburg University, Germany, Tribhuvan University, Nepal and Karachi University, Pakistan. His work opened a new vista for the development of other breakthrough technologies and is widely quoted even today in almost all standard textbooks on biotechnology and genetics.[9]/nAt Sagar University, he was not only instrumental in starting research on fish chondyocranium and harmonics but also in the teaching and research set up based on the Oxford pattern which he cherished. He served at Government College, Nainital[10] on return from University of Oxford, also to receive invitations from the University of Delhi and Benaras Hindu University. However, he opted to develop higher research and the University system in the state of his birth i.e. Madhya Pradesh on a call by the then Chief Minister Shri Kailash Nath Katju. To help set up Vikram University he joined as a University Professor at Gwalior in 1961 to later shift to Ujjain where he served in various capacities such as Dean and Emeritus Professor to be appointed as the Vice-Chancellor of Jiwaji University, Gwalior in 1977 where he worked until his sudden demise in 1981. While Prof Har Swarup worked with tremendous passion to set up and develop the upcoming Universities of Sagar, Ujjain, Bhopal, Indore and Jabalpur, he contributed much to the growth of higher education and research in the country and in setting up of the Association of Indian Universities (AIU), the University Grants Commission, the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR), the National Academy of Sciences, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)[11] the Indian Science Congress (INSC), where he also served as the sectional President. He published 5 textbooks, over 120 research papers, and several popular articles during a span of barely two decades. With over several score students who obtained their PhD and DSc under his supervision, his pioneering research and interests spanned from developmental morphology, experimental embryology and genetics to endocrinology, molecular biology and environmental sciences.

His researches in molecular embryology, RNA, DNA, and mitochondria in oogenesis and embryogenesis led him to the discovery of 'ringed polysome figures' and marked alternations in the energy-yielding processes of egg during differentiation. His work in limnology, fish growth and metabolism considerably helped develop fisheries, especially aqua-culture, in India. Dr. Har Swarup occupied more than 50 academic positions in various capacities, to name a few, General Secretary of Zoological Society (1962), Sectional President of Indian Science Congress, Bangalore (1971), Chairman of Indo-American Conference of Biologists (1973), President of Ichthyological Society of India (1979\u201380).[1] pdf.

His parents operated butcher shops in each of these villages.[3] He attended high school and the National Institute of Agronomy in Paris, and he received a Ph.D. from Rutgers University in 1927.[1]/nDubos began his career in microbiology in 1927, when he joined Oswald Avery's laboratory[4] at The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. Avery was looking for a microbe that could break down the polysaccharide capsule of a deadly strain of bacterial pneumonia in the same way that soil bacteria digested decaying organic matter in the woods. Dubos identified a bacterium that secreted an enzyme that broke down polysaccharide.[5] In 1939, with the help of Rockefeller Institute biochemist Rollin Hotchkiss, Dubos isolated the antibacterial agents tyrothricin and gramicidin from the bacterium Bacillus brevis that killed or inhibited Gram-positive bacteria and tested their bacterial, chemical, and clinical properties. These antibiotics remain in limited use today. In 1942, before antibiotics were in general use, Dubos warned that bacterial resistance should be expected.[6]/nDubos devoted most of his professional life to the empirical study of microbial diseases and to the analysis of the environmental and social factors that affect the welfare of humans. His pioneering research in isolating antibacterial substances from certain soil microorganisms led to the discovery of major antibiotics.  He performed groundbreaking research and wrote extensively on a number of subjects, including tuberculosis, pneumonia, and the mechanisms of acquired immunity, natural susceptibility, and resistance to infection./nIn 1948, Dubos shared the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award with Selman Waksman for \"their achievement in studies of the antibiotic properties of soil bacteria\".[7] He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1954 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1960.[8][9] A member of the National Academy of Sciences, he served as an editor of the Journal of Experimental Medicine from 1946 to 1972.[10]/nIn later years, Dubos explored the interplay of environmental forces and the physical, mental and spiritual development of mankind. The main tenets of his humanistic philosophy were: global problems are conditioned by local circumstances and choices, social evolution enables us to rethink human actions and change direction to promote an ecologically balanced environment, the future is optimistic since human life and nature are resilient and we have become increasingly aware of the dangers inherent in natural forces and human activities, and we can benefit from our successes and apply the lessons learned to solving other contemporary environmental problems./nFor the academic years 1963\u20131964 and 1964\u20131965, he was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Studies of Wesleyan University.[11] He served as chairman of the trustees of the Ren\u00e9 Dubos Center for Human Environment, a non-profit education and research organization that was dedicated in his honor in 1980.  The mission of the center, which was co-founded by William and Ruth Eblen, is to \"assist the general public and decision-makers in formulating policies for the resolution of environmental problems and the creation of environmental values.\"  Dubos remained actively involved with the Center until his death in 1982. He also served on the board of trustees of Science Service, now known as Society for Science & the Public, from 1949 to 1952./nDubos is often attributed as the author of the popular maxim \"Think Globally, Act Locally\" that refers to the argument that global environmental problems can turn into action only by considering ecological, economic, and cultural differences of our local surroundings. This motto appeared for the first time in 1977,[12] five years after Dubos served as advisor to the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment.[13] In 1979, Dubos suggested that ecological consciousness should begin at home. He urged creation of a world order in which \"natural and social units maintain or recapture their identity, yet interplay with each other through a rich system of communications\". In the 1980s, Dubos held to his thoughts on acting locally, and felt that issues involving the environment must be dealt with in their \"unique physical, climatic, and cultural contexts\".

This protein led to the determination of the pathway Src uses to cause cancer. This pathway is considered to be one of the most important cancer promoting signal cascades.[4] The pathway was not the only discovery in this lab at the time. Another discovery was that the Src was a threonine kinase. A standard methodology at the time was used in the lab to determine this phosphoamino acid.[5]/nIn 1982, Erikson decided to join the molecular and cellular biology department at Harvard University.[5] While at Harvard, Erikson was recognized for his contributions and discoveries about the v-Src oncogene.Some of the awards he earned included the Lasker Award (1982), the Robert Koch Prize (1982), the Alfred P.

One of these downstream alterations occurred in a ERK-MAP pathway. The alteration in this pathway was caused by a Ras oncogene. This discovery led to MEK inhibitors approved by the FDA for cancer treatment.[5] Another downstream alteration discovered was COX2.

After her father's sudden death, when she was 16, her initial thoughts were to study medicine; but her mother insisted on her taking a degree in Arts first.[8] Preliminary scientific courses could be included in such a degree, and it was there she acquired her first formal scientific teaching. It was in studying with Graham Kerr that she was given her first chance to work on the life cycles of protozoa.[8] This would prove a major theme and interest for the rest of her life.[8] She worked for two years in Glasgow after graduating. An early project was a study of Pseudospora volvocis, a protozoan parasite of the alga Volvox./nIn 1907 she was awarded a Carnegie Fellowship,[8] which she held from 1907 to 1910. With this, she was able moved to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to study trypanosome infections in reptiles, being provided with space to work by Arthur Willey, curator of the museum at Colombo She then joined the staff at the Lister Institute in London under Professor Edward Alfred Minchin from 1910 to 1911./nIt was at this time that a serious outbreak of sleeping sickness occurred in Uganda, believed to be responsible for more than 200,000 deaths.[9] Three successive commissions were sent to study the disease, under the auspices of the Royal Society.  Robertson was appointed protozoologist to what was then the Uganda Protectorate, from 1911 to 1914. She worked in the Royal Society laboratory at Mpumu, close to Lake Victoria Nyanza: the epicentre of the disease. At the laboratory she researched the lifecycle of Trypanosoma gambiense (which causes African trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness) in blood and in its insect carrier, the tsetse fly, publishing her ground-breaking results,[3] in particular establishing the path by which the trypanosome moves to the salivary glands of the fly.  In 1923 she obtained her Doctor of Science from the University of Glasgow for a thesis entitled A study of the life histories of certain trypanosomes,[10] which involved cytological studies of extreme delicacy.  A review of this research in her obituary,[11] in the journal Nature,  states: ''Her work on this subject has never been superseded nor indeed equalled, and the accuracy of some of her conclusions ... is only now being fully appreciated.\"./nOn the creation of the Tropical Medical Research Committee by the Medical Research Council in 1936,[12] Robertson was amongst the first of those elected to the Committee./nRobertson returned to the Lister Institute in 1914 shortly before World War I.

He had an older brother Erik who was born in 1749, also in Varnhem.[3]/nIn 1755, the family moved from Varnhem to the parish of Saleby outside Lidk\u00f6ping where his father became the parish priest; Anders' younger brother Kristoffer was born there in 1758.  His mother died in 1760, and two years later, Christoffer married Helena Elisabeth Kolmodin, daughter of the poet Olof Kolmodin. A half-brother, Olof Kolmodin Dahl, was born in 1766. After his stepmother's death in 1768, his father married for a third time; Anna Christina Svinhufvud, in 1770.  Christoffer Dahl died a year later, in 1771.[3]/nFrom an early age Dahl was interested in botany. Anders Tidstr\u00f6m, a disciple of pioneering botanist and taxonomist Carl Linnaeus, met the nine-year-old Dahl during his second journey through V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland in 1760, and mentions in his travel diary both young Anders' interest in botany, and his collection of plants (received from his uncle Anders Silvius, a chemist in Skara).[4]/nIn 1761 Dahl began school in Skara, and found several schoolmates who shared his interest in natural science. In conjunction with the parish priest and naturalist Clas Bjerkander, Dahl, Johan Abraham, entomologist Leonard Gyllenhaal,[5] chemist Johan Afzelius, Daniel N\u00e6z\u00e9n and Olof Kn\u00f6s founded \"The Swedish Topographic Society in Skara\" on 13 December 1769. The members reported on plant and animal life, geography, topography, historical monuments and economic life, mostly in the V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland area. During this time Dahl wrote several essays in these subjects; most of them are still unpublished./nOn 3 April 1770 Dahl entered Uppsala University, where he became one of Linnaeus's students. After his father's death in 1771, Dahl's family fell into financial straits and he had to leave school; prematurely ending his formal education. On 1 May 1776 he passed a preliminary candidate exam for medicine, the equivalent of a bachelor's degree./nOn a recommendation from Linnaeus, Dahl served as curator at the private natural museum and botanical garden of Clas Alstr\u00f6mer, a Linnaean disciple, at Kristinedal in Gamlestaden, outside Gothenburg. Dahl's employment involved several journeys in Sweden and abroad, where he collected natural history specimens both for Alstr\u00f6mer and himself.  During that time, Alstr\u00f6mer received several plants from Linnaeus himself, and Dahl was able to review the Linnean collection, which is now included in the collections of the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm.[6]/nIn 1781, Alstr\u00f6mer provided the financial backing for Linnaeus's son, Carl Linnaeus the Younger, to journey to England; on the Younger's death in 1783, Linnaeus sent Alstr\u00f6mer the herbarium parvum. This herbarium consisted of duplicates sorted out from Linnaeus' personal herbarium and other plants collected by his son. Dahl catalogued every specimen in the herbarium in his own handwriting, noting whether they came from \"a Linn\u00e9 P[ater].\" (father) or \"a Linn\u00e9 f[ilius].\" (son). It is clear that Dahl also received specimens; some specimens are labelled \"Dahl a Linn\u00e9 P.\" or \"Dahl a Linn\u00e9 f.\" On Alstr\u00f6mer's death in 1794, the herbarium was left to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, then to the Swedish Museum of Natural History. The specimens Dahl and Alstr\u00f6mer received from Linnaeus and his son are in the Linnean herbarium in Stockholm.[6]/nWhen Alstr\u00f6mer experienced financial losses in 1785 and moved to his estate at G\u00e5sevadsholm, outside Kungsbacka, Dahl followed./nIn 1786, the University of Kiel conferred an honorary Doctorate of Medicine on Dahl in Kiel, Germany, and the following year he became associate professor at the Academy of \u00c5bo in Turku (today's University of Helsinki), teaching medicine and botany.  He brought his personal herbarium to Turku, which later was destroyed in the historic fire of 1827. Parts of Dahl's collections have been preserved in Sahlberg's herbarium in the Botanical Museum at the University of Helsinki, and in Giseke's herbarium in the Royal Botanical Garden at Edinburgh./nDahl died in 1789 in Turku at the age of 38./nDahl's inventories of flora around Skara and Saleby, and some of the papers he wrote during as a student at Skara and Uppsala are in the Olof Kn\u00f6s Collection in the county library of Skara.[4]  The collection includes the minutes of \"The Swedish Topographic Society in Skara\" which contains some papers written by Dahl. Inspired by Linnaeus, Dahl wrote a Horologium Florae, a \"flower-clock\" of Skara, which was posthumously published in Ny Journal uti Hush\u00e5llningen, in May\u2013June 1790.  Olof Kn\u00f6s was the keeper of the minute-book and most probably published the article.  Johan Abraham Gyllenhaal's collections in the university library at Uppsala also contain some papers written by Dahl./nOn 3 January 1777, an excerpt from an anonymous letter was published in Inrikes Tidningar. The writer had, during a journey from Stockholm to Gothenburg in July 1776, visited \"Himmels-K\u00e4llan\" in Varnhem. The letter describes the quality of the spring and 58 species from the swamp around it are. It is presumed that since Dahl often visited Varnhem and his friend Jonas Odhner that the letter came from him./nDahl's only publication during his time in Gothenburg was a result of what was probably one of the first environmental-impact studies. Waste from the manufacturing of herring oil was a major problem, causing polluted water and sea bed organism death. Dahl was one of three members of a commission who studied the issue and wrote regulations regarding waste products from the try houses.  This document was the first historical step towards a restriction of industrial waste in Sweden. Dahl's diary on the draggings in the archipelago of Bohusl\u00e4n was published in Stockholm's Trangrum-Acten in 1784./nDuring his short time at Turku Dahl published his most important work: Observationes botanicae circa systema vegetabilium divi a Linne Gottingae 1784 editum, quibus accedit justae in manes Linneanos pietatis specimen (Kopenhagen, 1787)./nThe naming of the dahlia after Dahl has long been a subject of some confusion.  Many sources state that the name was bestowed by Linnaeus.  However, Linnaeus died in 1778, more than eleven years before the plant was introduced into Europe, so he could not have been the one to honour his former student.  It is most probable that first attempt to scientifically define the genus was done by Abbe Antonio Jose Cavanilles, Director of the Royal Gardens of Madrid, who received the first specimens from Mexico in 1791, two years after Dahl's death.[8]/nDahl was also honoured in the 1780s, Carl Peter Thunberg, a friend from Uppsala, named a species of plant from the family Hamamelidaceae after him. The Dahlia crinita is a reference to Dahl's appearance, probably to his large beard, since crinita is Latin for \"longhaired\".  Thunberg finally published the name in 1792.  The plant has now been reclassified as Trichocladus crinitus (Thunb.) Pers..[9]/nThunberg's original specimen is in the Swedish Museum of Natural History./nHe was also honoured in 1994, when Constance & Breedlove, named a genus of plant from New Mexico, Dahliaphyllum after him,[10] along with its one species Dahliaphyllum almedae Constance & Breedlove.[11]", "46317917": "Michael E.

He was also influenced by local palaeontologist Otto Linck. He served in World War II and resumed his studies at T\u00fcbingen, corresponding with the French ichnologist, Jacques Lessertisseur. Gaining his doctorate in 1951 on trace fossils, Seilacher moved to the University of Frankfurt (1957) and then the University of Baghdad before taking up a chair in palaeontology in G\u00f6ttingen.  He returned to T\u00fcbingen in 1964 as the successor to Schindewolf. After 1987 he held an Adjunct Professorship at Yale University./nSeilacher's publications are numerous (well over 200) and cover a range of topics.  His studies on trace fossils are perhaps his best-known contributions, especially his 1967 work on the bathymetry of trace fossils.  Here he established the concept of ichnofacies: distinctive assemblages of trace fossils controlled largely by depth. This characterisation was later expanded to include the influences of substrate, oxygen, salinity and so on.  In addition, he analysed many trace fossils in terms of the behaviour they represent, leading to such work as early computer simulation of trace fossil morphology (with David Raup, in 1969). Much of this work is summarized together with new material in Trace Fossil Analysis (2007).[7]/nIn 1970 he announced his programme of \"Konstruktions-Morphologie\" where he stressed the importance of three factors in determining the form of organisms: ecological/adaptive aspects; historical/phylogenetic aspects; and architectural/constructional aspects.  The latter two factors are important sources of biological constraints; both acknowledging that both history and constructional principles place limits on what may be achieved in at least the short term of evolution.  Such a view was influential on later workers such as Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin, such as their famous paper on \"spandrels\" that criticized panadaptionist accounts of evolution and form./nSeilacher's interest in pattern formation led him to espouse self-organisation models for the origin of certain types of form, the most famous of which are pneu structures. These are fluid-filled structures under tension whose form is broadly determined by the need to distribute the tension across the surface. Seilacher may thus be squarely considered to be a structuralist.[8][9]/nSeilacher coined the term Lagerst\u00e4tten (meaning a sedimentary deposit that exhibits extraordinary fossils with exceptional preservation and/or concentration).[10] One of his 1985 papers on Lagerst\u00e4tten proposed a scheme for their classification that went on to become widely accepted. Much of his work has been concerned with preservation and taphonomy in general./nHis most controversial contributions were in his work on the Ediacaran assemblages, which he and Friedrich Pfl\u00fcger (1994) suggested, based on their constructional morphology, to be pneu structures unrelated to modern metazoans.  While this view has been steadily opposed by many workers, it gained some ground as the affinities of many of these organisms have remained resistant to analysis. Seilacher considered many of these taxa to be giant xenophyophores, i.e. large rhizopodal protists.

He has studied the colour polymorphism of coconut crabs, the conservation of fragments of forest, and the function of coloration in mammals, especially zebra stripes.[3][4][5]/nCaro's team found evidence that zebra stripes help to reduce biting by tabanid flies, but no reliable support for traditionally held hypotheses about the function of zebra stripes including camouflage, predator avoidance, heat management, or social interaction.[6] He evaluated 18 different proposed explanations for the stripes, devising and carrying out quantitative tests to compare them. The evolutionary ecologist Tim Birkhead, writing in the Times Higher Education, praised Caro's 2006 book Zebra Stripes as \"an exemplary study\", calling it \"one long argument\", a phrase used by Darwin of his On the Origin of Species, summarizing it as \"in essence a 300-page scientific paper\".[7] Karin Brulliard, writing in The Washington Post under the headline \"To figure out why the zebra got its stripes, this researcher dressed up like one\", portrays Caro in a zebra costume \"not used in his fieldwork\", but also in a tailor-made striped suit in the Tanzanian bush, as well as in pelts of zebra and the unstriped wildebeest. The newspaper reports Caro as \"absolutely convinced\" that he has found the right explanation.[8] Matthew Cobb, writing in New Scientist, recalls Rudyard Kipling's children's book, Just So Stories, in which the zebra got his stripes by standing half-in, half-out of the shadows \"with the slippery-slidy shadows of the trees\" on his body.

He went on to the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where he became a Privatdozent (unsalaried lecturer), and shortened his name to Oken. As Lorenz Oken, he published a small work entitled Grundriss der Naturphilosophie, der Theorie der Sinne, mit der darauf gegr\u00fcndeten Classification der Thiere (1802). This was the first of a series of works which established him as a leader of the movement of \"Naturphilosophie\" in Germany.[1]/nIn it he extended to physical science the philosophical principles which Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804) had applied to epistemology and morality.[1] Oken had been preceded in this by Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762\u20131814), who, acknowledging that Kant had discovered the materials for a universal science, declared that all that was needed was a systematic coordination of these materials. Fichte undertook this task in his \"Doctrine of Science\" (Wissenschaftslehre), whose aim was to construct all knowledge by a priori means. This attempt, which was merely sketched out by Fichte, was further elaborated by the philosopher Friedrich Schelling (1775\u20131854). Oken built on Schelling's work, producing a synthesis of what he held Schelling to have achieved.[1]/nOken produced the seven-volume series Allgemeine Naturgeschichte f\u00fcr alle St\u00e4nde, with engravings by Johann Susemihl (1767\u20131847), and published in Stuttgart by Hoffman between 1839 and 1841.[2]/nIn the Grundriss der Naturphilosophie of 1802 Oken sketched the outlines of the scheme he afterwards devoted himself to perfecting. The position advanced in that work, to which he continued to adhere, is that \"the animal classes are virtually nothing else than a representation of the sense-organs, and that they must be arranged in accordance with them.\" Consequently, Oken contended that there are only five animal classes:[1]/nIn 1805 Oken made a further advance in the application of the a priori principle in a book on generation (Die Zeugung), in which he maintained that \"all organic beings originate from and consist of vesicles or cells. These vesicles, when singly detached and regarded in their original process of production, are the infusorial mass or protoplasma (Urschleim) whence all larger organisms fashion themselves or are evolved. Their production is therefore nothing else than a regular agglomeration of Infusoria\u2014not, of course, of species already elaborated or perfect, but of mucous vesicles or points in general, which first form themselves by their union or combination into particular species.\"[1]/nA year after the production of this treatise, Oken developed his system one stage further, and in a volume published in 1806, written with the assistance of Dietrich von Kieser (1779\u20131862), entitled Beitr\u00e4ge zur vergleichenden Zoologie, Anatomie, und Physiologie, he demonstrated that the intestines originate from the umbilical vesicle, and that this corresponds to the vitellus or yolk-bag. Caspar Wolff (1735\u20131794) had previously claimed to demonstrate this fact in the chick (Theoria Generationis, 1774), but he did not see its application as evidence of a general law. Oken showed the importance of the discovery as an illustration of his system. In the same work Oken described and recalled attention to the corpora Wolffiana, or \"primordial kidneys.\"[1]/nThe reputation of the young Privatdozent of G\u00f6ttingen had reached the ear of Johann von Goethe (1749\u20131832), and in 1807 Oken was invited to fill the office of Extraordinary Professor of the Medical Sciences at the University of Jena. He selected for the subject of his inaugural discourse his ideas on the \"Signification of the Bones of the Skull,\" based on a discovery of the previous year. This lecture was delivered in the presence of Goethe, as privy councillor and rector of the university, and was published in the same year, with the title, Ueber die Bedeutung der Sch\u00e4delknochen.  With regard to the origin of the idea, Oken narrates in his Isis that, walking one autumn day in 1806 in the Harz forest, he stumbled on the blanched skull of a deer, picked up the partially dislocated bones, and contemplated them for a while, when it suddenly occurred to him, \"It is a vertebral column!\" At a meeting of the German naturalists held at Jena some years afterwards, Professor Kieser gave an account of Oken's discovery in the presence of the grand duke, which is printed in the Tageblatt, or \"proceedings,\u201d of that meeting. The professor stated that Oken told him of his discovery when journeying in 1806 to the island of Wangerooge. On their return to G\u00f6ttingen, Oken explained his ideas by reference to the skull of a turtle in Kieser's collection, which he disarticulated for that purpose.[1] Kieser displayed the skull, its bones marked in Oken's handwriting./nOken's lectures at Jena were wide-ranging, and were highly regarded at the time. The subjects included natural philosophy, general natural history, zoology, comparative anatomy, the physiology of man, of animals and of plants. The spirit with which he grappled with the vast scope of science is characteristically illustrated in his essay Ueber das Universum als Fortsetzung des Sinnensystems (1808). In this work he lays it down that \"organism is none other than a combination of all the universe's activities within a single individual body.\" This doctrine led him to the conviction that \"world and organism are one in kind, and do not stand merely in harmony with each other.\" In the same year he published his Erste Ideen zur Theorie des Lichts, &c., in which he advanced the proposition that \"light could be nothing but a polar tension of the ether, evoked by a central body in antagonism with the planets, and heat was none other than a motion of this ether\"\u2014a sort of vague anticipation of the doctrine of the \"correlation of physical forces.\"[1]/nIn 1809 Oken extended his system to the mineral world, arranging the ores, not according to the metals, but according to their combinations with oxygen, acids and sulphur. In 1810 he summed up his views on organic and inorganic nature into one compendious system. In the first edition of the Lehrbuch der Naturphilosophie, which appeared in that and the following years, he sought to bring his different doctrines into mutual connection, and to \"show that the mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms are not to be arranged arbitrarily in accordance with single and isolated characters, but to be based upon the cardinal organs or anatomical systems, from which a firmly established number of classes would necessarily be evolved; that each class, moreover, takes its starting-point from below, and consequently that all of them pass parallel to each other\"; and that, \"as in chemistry, where the combinations follow a definite numerical law, so also in anatomy the organs, in physiology the functions, and in natural history the classes, families, and even genera of minerals, plants, and animals present a similar arithmetical ratio.\" The Lehrbuch procured for Oken the title of Hofrath, or court-councillor, and in 1812 he was appointed ordinary professor of the natural sciences.[1]/nIn 1816 Oken began publication of his well-known periodical, Isis, eine encyclop\u00e4dische Zeitschrift, vorz\u00fcglich f\u00fcr Naturgeschichte, vergleichende Anatomie und Physiologie. In this journal appeared essays and notices on the natural sciences and other subjects of interest; poetry, and even comments on the politics of other German states, were occasionally admitted. This led to representations and remonstrances from the governments criticized or impugned, and the court of Weimar called upon Oken either to suppress Isis or resign his professorship. He chose the latter alternative. The publication of Isis at Weimar was prohibited. Oken made arrangements for its issue at Rudolstadt, and this continued uninterruptedly until the year 1848.[1]/nIn 1821 Oken promulgated in Isis the first idea of the annual general meetings of the Society of German Natural Scientists and Physicians, which was realized in the following year, when the first meeting was held at Leipzig. The British Association for the Advancement of Science was at the outset avowedly organized after the German or Okenian model. In 1828 Oken resumed his original humble duties as privatdocent in the newly established University of Munich, and soon afterwards he was appointed ordinary professor in the same university. In 1832, on the proposal by the Bavarian government to transfer him to a professorship in a provincial university of the state, he resigned his appointments and left the kingdom. He was appointed in 1833 to the professorship of natural history in the then recently established University of Z\u00fcrich. There he continued to reside, fulfilling his professional duties and promoting the progress of his favourite sciences, until his death.[1]/nAll of Oken's writings are deductive illustrations of an assumed principle, which, with other philosophers of the transcendental school, he deemed equal to the explanation of all the mysteries of nature. According to him, the head was a repetition of the trunk\u2014a kind of second trunk, with its limbs and other appendages; this sum of his observations and comparisons\u2014few of which he ever gave in detail\u2014ought always to be borne in mind in comparing the share taken by Oken in homological anatomy with the progress made by other cultivators of that philosophical branch of the science.  The idea of the analogy between the skull, or parts of the skull, and the vertebral column had been previously propounded and ventilated in their lectures by Johann von Autenrieth (1772\u20131835) and Carl Kielmeyer (1765\u20131844), and in the writings of Johann Frank (1745\u20131821). By Oken it was applied chiefly in illustration of the mystical system of Schelling\u2014the \"all-in-all\" and \"all-in-every-part.\" From the earliest to the latest of Oken's writings on the subject, \"the head is a repetition of the whole trunk with all its systems: the brain is the spinal cord; the cranium is the vertebral column; the mouth is intestine and abdomen; the nose is the lungs and thorax; the jaws are the limbs; and the teeth the claws or nails.\" Johann von Spix (1781\u20131826) in his folio Cephalogenesis (1818), richly illustrated comparative craniology, but presented the facts under the same transcendental guise; and Georges Cuvier (1769\u20131832) availed himself of the extravagances of these disciples of Schelling to cast ridicule on the whole inquiry into those higher relations of parts to the archetype which Sir Richard Owen (1804\u20131892) called \"general homologies.\"[1]/nThe vertebral theory of the skull had practically disappeared from anatomical science when the labours of Cuvier drew to their close. In Owen's Archetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton the idea was not only revived but worked out for the first time inductively, and the theory rightly stated, as follows: \"The head is not a virtual equivalent of the trunk, but is only a portion, i.e. certain modified segments, of the whole body. The jaws are the 'haemal arches' of the first two segments; they are not limbs of the head\" (p.\u00a0176).[1]/nVaguely and strangely, however, as Oken had blended the idea with his a priori conception of the nature of the head, the chance of appropriating it seems to have overcome the moral sense of Goethe\u2014unless indeed the poet deceived himself. Comparative osteology had early attracted Goethe's attention. In 1786 he published at Jena his essay Ueber den Zwischenkieferknochen des Menschen und der Thiere, showing that the intermaxillary bone existed in man as well as in brutes. But not a word in this essay gives the remotest hint of his having then possessed the idea of the vertebral analogies of the skull. In 1820, in his Morphologie, he first publicly stated that thirty years before the date of that publication he had discovered the secret relationship between the vertebrae and the bones of the head, and that he had always continued to meditate on this subject. The circumstances under which the poet, in 1820, narrates having become inspired with the original idea are suspiciously analogous to those described by Oken in 1807, as producing the same effect on his mind. A bleached skull is accidentally discovered in both instances: in Oken's it was that of a deer in the Harz forest; in Goethe's it was that of a sheep picked up on the shores of the Lido, at Venice.[1]/nIt may be assumed that Oken, as a Privatdozent at G\u00f6ttingen in 1806, knew nothing of this unpublished idea or discovery of Goethe, and that Goethe first became aware that Oken had the idea of the vertebral relations of the skull when he listened to the introductory discourse in which the young professor, invited by the poet to Jena, selected this very idea for its subject. It is incredible that Oken, had he adopted the idea from Goethe, or been aware of an anticipation by him, should have omitted to acknowledge the source\u2014should not rather have eagerly embraced so appropriate an opportunity of doing graceful homage to the originality and genius of his patron.[1]/nIn 1832, Oken was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.", "20660631": "C\u00e9sar Barbosa (born 1954) is a Colombian biologist, ornithologist[1] and botanist, specialising in the study of Fabaceae./nIn 1976 received his BA in Biology from the National University of Colombia./nHe is a researcher at the Herbarium of the National Institute of Renewable Natural Resources and Environment (Colombia) (INDERENA), specialising in legumes and has made botanical expeditions within Colombia.

Other contributions include the discovery of Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system, the discovery and study of pepsin, the discovery of the organic nature of yeast,[4] and the invention of the term \"metabolism\".[5]/nTheodor Schwann was born in Neuss on 7 December 1810 to Leonard Schwann and Elisabeth Rottels.[6] Leonard Schwann was a goldsmith and later a printer. Theodor Schwann studied at the Dreik\u00f6nigsgymnasium (also known as the Tricoronatum or Three Kings School), a Jesuit school in Cologne.[6][7] Schwann was a devout Roman Catholic. In Cologne his religious instructor Wilhelm Smets\u00a0[de], a priest and novelist,  emphasized the individuality of the human soul and the importance of free will.[8]:\u200a643\u200a[6][7]/nIn 1829, Schwann enrolled at the University of Bonn in the premedical curriculum.  He received a bachelor of philosophy in 1831.[9] While at Bonn, Schwann met and worked with physiologist Johannes Peter M\u00fcller.[3]\nM\u00fcller is considered to have founded scientific medicine in Germany, publishing his Handbuch der Physiologie des Menschen f\u00fcr Vorlesungen in 1837\u20131840.[10]:\u200a387\u200a  It was translated into English as Elements of Physiology in 1837\u20131843 and became the leading physiology textbook of the 1800s.[6]/nIn 1831, Schwann moved to the University of W\u00fcrzburg for clinical training in medicine.[7][11] In 1833, he went to the University of Berlin, where M\u00fcller was now Professor of Anatomy and Physiology.[7] Schwann graduated with an M.D. degree in medicine from the University of Berlin in 1834. He did his thesis work in 1833\u20131834, with M\u00fcller as his advisor. Schwann's thesis involved a careful study of the necessity for oxygen during the embryonic development of the chicken. To carry it out, he designed and built an apparatus that enabled him to pump the gases oxygen and hydrogen out of the incubation chamber at specific times.  This enabled him to establish the critical period in which the eggs needed oxygen.[12]:\u200a60/nSchwann passed the state examination to practice medicine in the summer of 1834, but he chose to continue to work with M\u00fcller, doing research rather than practicing medicine.[11] He could afford to do so, at least in the short term, because of a family inheritance.[12]:\u200a60\u200a His salary as an assistant was only 120 taler.  For the next five years, Schwann would pay the other three-quarters of his expenses out of his inheritance. As a long-term strategy, it was not sustainable.[12]:\u200a86/nFrom 1834 to 1839, Schwann worked as an assistant to M\u00fcller in at the Anatomisch-zootomische Museum at the University of Berlin.[11] Schwann carried out a series of microscopic and physiological experiments focused on studying the structure and function of nerves, muscles and blood vessels.[13] In addition to performing experiments in preparation for M\u00fcller's book on physiology, Schwann did research of his own. Many of his important contributions were made during the time that he worked with M\u00fcller in Berlin.[6]/nSchwann used newly powerful microscopes to examine animal tissues.  This enabled him to observe animal cells and note their different properties. His work complemented that of Matthias Jakob Schleiden in plants and was informed by it; the two were close friends.[14][12]:\u200a60/nDescribed as quiet and serious, Schwann was particularly gifted in the construction and use of apparatus for his experiments. He was also able to identify important scientific questions and design experiments to systematically test them.  His writing has been described as accessible, and his logic as a \"clear progression\".[12]:\u200a60\u200a He identified the question that he wanted to answer and communicated the importance of his findings effectively to others. His co-worker Jakob Henle spoke of him as having an \"inborn drive\" to experiment.[12]:\u200a60/nBy 1838, Schwann needed a position with a more substantial salary.  He hoped to return to Bonn, a Catholic city.  He attempted to gain a professorship there in 1838 and again in 1846, but was disappointed.[9]:\u200a85\u201386\u200a Instead, in 1839, Schwann accepted the chair of anatomy at the Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain in Leuven, Belgium, another Catholic city.[11][9]:\u200a85\u201386/nSchwann proved to be a dedicated and conscientious professor.\nWith his new teaching duties, he had less time for new scientific work.  He spent considerable time perfecting experimental techniques and instruments for use in experiments. He produced few papers. One exception was a paper in 1844 that reported on a series of experiments on dogs and established the importance of bile in digestion.[12]:\u200a87\u200a[13]/nIn examining processes such as muscle contraction, fermentation, digestion, and putrefaction, Schwann sought to show that living phenomena were the result of physical causes rather than \"some immaterial vital force\".[8]:\u200a643\u200a Nonetheless, he still sought to reconcile \"an organic nature\" with  \"a divine plan.\"[8]:\u200a645\u200a Some writers have suggested that Schwann's move in 1838, and his decreased scientific productivity after that, reflect religious concerns and perhaps even a crisis relating to the theoretical implications of his work on cell theory.[13][9]:\u200a85\u201386\u200a However, other authors regard this as misrepresenting his thinking, and reject the idea that Schwann went through an existential crisis or a mystical phase.[9]:\u200a85\u201386\u200a Ohad Parnes uses Schwann's laboratory notebooks and other unpublished sources along with his publications to reconstruct his research as a unified progression.[15]:\u200a126\u200a Florence Vienne draws on unpublished writings to discuss the ways in which cell theory, as a \"unifying principle of organic development\", related to the philosophical, religious, and political ideas of various proponents including Schwann.[8]/nIn 1848, Schwann's compatriot Antoine Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Spring convinced him to transfer to the University of Li\u00e8ge, also in Belgium.[11] At Li\u00e8ge, Schwann continued to follow the latest advances in anatomy and physiology but did not himself make major new discoveries. He became something of an inventor.  One of his projects was a portable respirator, designed as a closed system to support human life in environments where the surroundings cannot be breathed.[13]\nBy 1858 he was serving as professor of physiology, general anatomy and embryology. In 1863, the American Philosophical Society elected him an international member.[16]  As of 1872, he ceased to teach general anatomy, and as of 1877, embryology. \nHe retired fully in 1879.[11]/nSchwann was deeply respected by his peers.  In 1878, a festival was held to celebrate his years of teaching and his many contributions. He was presented with a unique gift: a book containing 263 autographed photographic portraits of scientists from various countries, each of them sent by the scientist to be part of the gift for Schwann. The volume was dedicated \"To the creator of the cell theory, the contemporary biologists.\"[13]/nThree years after retiring, Schwann died in Cologne, on 11 January 1882.[7]\nHe was buried in the family tomb in Cologne's Melaten Cemetery.[17]/nWhen viewed in the context of his unpublished writings and laboratory notes, Schwann's research can be seen as \"a coherent and systematic research programme\" in which biological processes are described in terms of material objects or \"agents\", and the causal dependencies between the forces that they exert, and their measurable effects. Schwann's idea of the cell as a fundamental, active unit then can be seen as foundational to the development of microbiology as \"a rigorously lawful science\".[15]:\u200a121\u2013122/nSome of Schwann's earliest work in 1835 involved muscle contraction, which he saw as a starting point for \"the introduction of calculation to physiology\".[15]:\u200a122\u200a\nHe developed and described an experimental method to calculate the contraction force of the muscle, by controlling and measuring the other variables involved.[15] \nHis measurement technique was developed and used later by Emil du Bois-Reymond and others.[18]\nSchwann's notes suggest that he hoped to discover regularities and laws of physiological processes.[15]/nIn 1835, relatively little was known about digestive processes. William Prout had reported in 1824 that the digestive juices of animals contained hydrochloric acid. Schwann realized that other substances in digestive juices might also help to break down food.[6] \nAt the beginning of 1836, Schwann began to study digestive processes. He conceptualized digestion as the action of a physiological agent, which, though not immediately visible or measurable, could be characterized experimentally as a \"peculiar specific substance\".[15]:\u200a124\u2013125/nEventually Schwann found the enzyme pepsin, which he successfully isolated from the stomach lining and named in 1836.[19][6][3] Schwann coined its name from the Greek word \u03c0\u03ad\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2 pepsis, meaning \"digestion\" (from \u03c0\u03ad\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd peptein \"to digest\").[20][21]\nPepsin was the first enzyme to be isolated from animal tissue.[19]\nHe demonstrated that it could break down the albumin from egg-white into peptones.[17][22]/nEven more importantly, Schwann wrote, by carrying through such analyses one could eventually \"explain the whole developmental process of life in all organized bodies.\"[15]:\u200a126\u200a During the next year, he studied both decomposition and respiration, constructing apparatus that he would later adapt for the study of yeast.[15]:\u200a128/nNext Schwann studied yeast and fermentation. His work on yeast was independent of work done by Charles Cagniard de la Tour and Friedrich Traugott K\u00fctzing, all of whom published work in 1837.[6][23][24][25]\nBy 1836, Schwann had carried out numerous experiments on alcohol fermentation.[6] Powerful microscopes made it possible for him to observe yeast cells in detail and recognize that they were tiny organisms whose structures resembled those of plants.[26]/nSchwann went beyond others who simply had noted the multiplication of yeast during alcoholic fermentation, first by assigning yeast the role of a primary causal factor, and then by claiming it was alive.  Schwann used the microscope to carry out a carefully planned series of experiments that contraindicated two popular theories of fermentation in yeast. First he controlled the temperature of fluid from fermenting beer in a closed vessel in the presence of oxygen. Once heated, the liquid could no longer ferment. This disproved Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac's speculation that oxygen caused fermentation. It suggested that some sort of microorganism was necessary for the process to happen. Next, Schwann tested the effects of purified air and unpurified air.[27] He sterilized the air by passing it through heated glass bulbs.[24] Fermentation did not occur in the presence of purified air.  It did occur in the presence of unpurified air, suggesting that something in the air started the process. This was strong evidence against the theory of spontaneous generation, the idea that living organisms could develop out of nonliving matter.[27]/nSchwann had demonstrated that fermentation required the presence of yeasts to start, and stopped when the yeasts stopped growing.[28]\nHe concluded that sugar was converted to alcohol as part of an organic biological process based on the action of a living substance, the yeast. He demonstrated that fermentation was not an inorganic chemical process like sugar oxidation.[27] Living yeast was necessary for the reaction that would produce more yeast.[23]/nAlthough Schwann was correct, his ideas were ahead of most of his peers.[6] They were strongly opposed by Justus von Liebig and Friedrich W\u00f6hler, both of whom saw his emphasis on the importance of a living organism as supporting vitalism. Liebig, in contrast, saw fermentation as a series of purely chemical events, without involving living matter.[29]\nIronically, Schwann's work was later seen as being a first step away from vitalism.[23]:\u200a56\u201357\u200a Schwann was the first of M\u00fcller's pupils to work towards a physico-chemical explanation of life.[3] Schwann's view furthered a conceptualization of living things in terms of the biological reactions of organic chemistry, while Liebig sought to reduce biological reactions to purely inorganic chemistry.[30]/nThe value of Schwann's work on fermentation eventually would be recognized by Louis Pasteur, ten years later.[6] Pasteur would begin his fermentation research in 1857 by repeating and confirming Schwann's work, accepting that yeast were alive, and then taking fermentation research further. Pasteur, not Schwann, would challenge Liebig's views in the Liebig\u2013Pasteur dispute.[30]\nIn retrospect, the germ theory of Pasteur, as well as its antiseptic applications by Lister, can be traced to Schwann's influence.[3]/nIn 1837, Matthias Jakob Schleiden viewed and stated that new plant cells formed from the nuclei of old plant cells. Dining with Schwann one day, their conversation turned on the nuclei of plant and animal cells. Schwann remembered seeing similar structures in the cells of the notochord (as had been shown by M\u00fcller) and instantly realized the importance of connecting the two phenomena. The resemblance was confirmed without delay by both observers. In further experiments, Schwann examined notochordal tissue and cartilage from toad larvae, as well as tissues from pig embryos, establishing that animal tissues are composed of cells, each of which has a nucleus.[14]/nSchwann published his observations in 1838 in the Neue notisen geb. nat.-heilk.[31] \nThis was followed in 1839 by the publication of his book Mikroskopische Untersuchungen \u00fcber die Uebereinstimmung in der Struktur und dem Wachsthum der Thiere und Pflanzen (Microscopic investigations on the similarity of structure and growth of animals and plants). It is considered a landmark work,[14]\nfoundational to modern biology.[32]/nIn it Schwann declared that \"All living things are composed of cells and cell products\".[33] \nHe drew three further conclusions about cells, which formed his cell theory or cell doctrine. The first two were correct:/nBy the 1860s, these tenets were the accepted basis of cell theory, used to describe the elementary anatomical composition of plants and animals.[3]/nSchwann's theory and observations created a foundation for modern histology.[3] Schwann claimed that \"there is one universal principle of development for the elementary parts of organisms, however different, and this principle is the formation of cells.\"[34] \nSchwann supported this claim by examining adult animal tissues and showing that all tissues could be classified in terms of five types of highly differentiated cellular tissues.[23][6]/nHis observation that the single-celled ovum eventually becomes a complete organism, established one of the basic principles of embryology.[23]/nSchwann's third tenet, speculating on the formation of cells, was later disproven. Schwann hypothesized that living cells formed in ways similar to the formation of crystals. Biologists would eventually accept the view of pathologist Rudolf Virchow, who popularized the maxim Omnis cellula e cellula\u2014that every cell arises from another cell\u2014in 1857. The epigram was originally put forth by Fran\u00e7ois-Vincent Raspail in 1825,[35] but Raspail's writings were unpopular, partly due to his republican sentiments. There is no evidence to suggest that Schwann and Raspail were aware of each other's work.[8]:\u200a630\u2013631/nSchwann was particularly interested in nervous and muscular tissues. \nAs part of his efforts to classify bodily tissues in terms of their cellular nature, he discovered the cells that envelope the nerve fibers, which are now called Schwann cells in his honor.[17] How the fatty myelin sheaths of peripheral nerves were formed was a matter of debate that could not be answered until the electron microscope was invented.[36][37]  All axons in the peripheral nervous system are now known to be wrapped in Schwann cells. Their mechanisms continue to be studied.[36][38][39]/nSchwann also discovered that muscle tissue in the upper esophagus was striated.[17]  He speculated that the muscular nature of the esophagus enabled it to act as a pipe, moving food between the mouth and the stomach.[40]/nIn examining teeth, Schwann was the first to notice \"cylindrical cells\" connected to both the inner surface of the enamel and the pulp. He also identified fibrils in the dentinal tubes, which later became known as \"Tomes's fibers\". He speculated on the possible structural and functional significance of the tubes and fibrils.[17][41]/nIn his Microscopical researches, Schwann introduced the term \"metabolism\", which he first used in the German adjectival form \"metabolische\" to describe the chemical action of cells.  French texts in the 1860s began to use le m\u00e9tabolisme. Metabolism was introduced into English by Michael Foster in his Textbook of Physiology in 1878.[42]/n100% true btw", "72696241": "Susan Gottesman/nC.

Dolly, a Finn Dorset sheep named after the singer Dolly Parton, was born in 1996 and lived to be six years old (dying from a viral infection and not old age, as has been suggested). Campbell had a key role in the creation of Dolly, as he had the crucial idea of co-ordinating the stages of the \"cell cycle\" of the donor somatic cells and the recipient eggs and using diploid quiescent or \"G0\" arrested somatic cells as nuclear donors.

The protein fractions in native (N) and the denatured states (D) were characterized by UV spectrometry and viscosity measurements at defined temperatures in buffer pH 7.0. The thermodynamics of folding and possibly kinetics followed a two state transition (N->D). The data were consistent with the fact that the native state was stabilized by hydrophobic effect in aqueous solution; this effect was diminished by introducing Guanidine hydrochloride to protein solution with concomitant transition to denatured state, random coil conformation similar to a nascent polypeptide chain.[13][14]/nEgg white Ovomucoid: The unfolding of ovomucoid (N), a domain containing 28 kDa protein, by guanidine hydrochloride did not proceed in a single step but occurred in two steps; the transition at low denaturant was associated with an intermediate, native-like, structure (X), and at high denaturant, protein existed in random coil structure (D). The reversible unfolding at each step (N->X->D) followed a two state transition pattern, albeit with somewhat different folding rates for the intermediate and native structures (1978).[15] The studies in his lab indicated that in vivo protein folding may not be explained by the amino acid sequence alone.

He studied chemical engineering at Technical University Delft, writing a dissertation on the pectinases of Penicillium chrysogenum.[2] On the advice of Albert Kluyver, when he was 26 years old he moved to California to study as a post-graduate at UC Berkeley.[3]/nWhile at Berkeley, Phaff worked in Emil Mrak's laboratory, who is said to have had a major influence on him.[2][3] When he first arrived, he was most interested in studying fruit juices, but Mrak asked him to work on yeasts, knowing he had worked in Kluyver's laboratory.[4] His PhD was supervised by Maynard Joslyn and focussed on yeast taxonomy, ecology and physiology. After completing his PhD in 1943, he accepted a faculty position at Berkeley, before moving to the food science department of UC Davis in 1954. During the 1950s, he wrote several classic scientific papers, published in Nature on yeast pectinases with Arnold Demain.[2][3][5] Whilst at UC Davis, he worked with the Chinese born food scientist, Bor S. Luh.[6] In 1969 he was named University of California at Davis Faculty Research Lecturer. In 1985 he co-authored a definitive book on viticulture with Maynard Amerine. Despite officially retiring in 1983, he maintained a busy laboratory and continued to conduct research daily.[3] His contributions to the study of yeast ecology are unparalleled.[7] At various times in his career he was an editor of several scientific journals including the Yeast Newsletter, the Journal of Bacteriology, the Canadian Journal of Microbiology and the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology.[2]/nPhaff was a pioneer of using molecular techniques to classify yeasts, along with his colleagues and students, Phaff described over 60 yeast taxa through his career.[2] In 1976, the yeast genus Phaffia (in the Cystofilobasidiaceae family) was isolated from tree exudates and was named after Phaff, by Martin Miller and two Japanese colleagues, in recognition of his contributions to yeast taxonomy and ecology.[8] The species, Phaffia rhodozyma is economically important today because it synthesises the carotenoid pigment, astaxanthin.[7]/nIn 1997, Yuzo Yamada published Phaffomyces, which is a genus of fungi within the Saccharomycetales order, also named in his honour..[9][10]/nThrough his 60-year career he collected 6400 yeast strains from animals, soil and plants (including over 1000 from cacti), from countries all around the world. There are few collections of microbial cultures so large that have been accumulated by institutions and likely none so large that have been accumulated by any other single researcher. The collection, known as the Phaff Yeast Culture Collection contains 400 of the 700 identified species of yeast and has been described as priceless, with a large number of wild type isolates making it unique amongst yeast collections.[3][11] According to the current curator, 80% of the yeasts in the collection are not available from other sources.[12] A 2003 yeast symposium organized by FEMS (Federation of European Microbiological Societies) was named in his memory[13] and the talks were summarised in a special edition of International Microbiology.[14]", "1720832": "Douglas Harold Copp CC FRS FRSC (January 16, 1915 \u2013 March 17, 1998) was a Canadian scientist who discovered and named the hormone calcitonin, which is used in the treatment of bone disease.[1]/nBorn in Toronto, Ontario, he received his MD from the University of Toronto in 1939 and his PhD in biochemistry from the University of California at Berkeley in 1943.

He joined Washington University in St. Louis as a junior faculty member in 1994, and was a Research Associate Professor of Genetics from 2002 to 2007.[2][3]/nAfter initially studying physics, Gish obtained an A.B. degree in Biochemistry from University of California, Berkeley, and completed work for his Ph.D. degree in Molecular Biology at the same institution in 1988.[1]/nGish is primarily known for his contributions to NCBI BLAST,[4][5] his creation of the BLAST Network Service and nr (non-redundant) databases, his 1996 release of the original gapped BLAST (WU-BLAST 2.0), and most recently his development and support of AB-BLAST. At Washington University in St. Louis, Gish also led the genome analysis group which annotated all finished human, mouse and rat genome data produced by the University's Genome Sequencing Center from 1995 through 2002./nAs a graduate student, Gish applied the Quine-McCluskey algorithm to the analysis of splice site recognition sequences. In 1985, with a view toward rapid identification of restriction enzyme recognition sites in DNA, Gish developed a DFA function library in the C language. The idea to apply a finite-state machine to this problem had been suggested by fellow graduate student and BSD UNIX developer Mike Karels. Gish's DFA implementation was that of a Mealy machine architecture, which is more compact than an equivalent Moore machine and hence faster. Construction of the DFA was O(n), where n is the sum of the lengths of the query sequences. The DFA could then be used to scan subject sequences in a single pass with no backtracking in O(m) time, where m is the total length of the subject(s). The method of DFA construction was recognized later as being a consolidation of two algorithms, Algorithms 3 and 4 described by Alfred V. Aho and Margaret J. Corasick.[6]/nWhile working for U.C. Berkeley in December 1986, Gish sped up the FASTP program\n[7]\n(later known as FASTA[8]) of William R. Pearson and David J. Lipman by 2- to 3-fold without altering the results. When the performance modifications were communicated to Pearson and Lipman, Gish further suggested that a DFA (rather than a lookup table) would yield faster k-tuple identification and improve the overall speed of the program by perhaps as much as 10% in some cases; however such marginal improvement even in the best case was deemed by the authors to not be worth the added code complexity. Gish also envisioned at this time a centralized search service, wherein all nucleotide sequences from GenBank would be maintained in memory to eliminate I/O bottlenecks\u2014and stored in compressed form to conserve memory\u2014with clients invoking FASTN searches remotely via the Internet./nGish's earliest contributions to BLAST were made while working at the NCBI, starting in July 1989. Even in early prototypes BLAST was typically much faster than FASTA. Gish recognized the potential added benefit in this application of using a DFA for word-hit recognition. He morphed his earlier DFA code into a flexible form that he incorporated into all BLAST search modes. Others of his contributions to BLAST include:  the use of compressed nucleotide sequences, both as an efficient storage format and as a rapid, native search format; parallel processing; memory-mapped I/O; the use of sentinel bytes and sentinel words at the start and end of sequences to improve the speed of word-hit extension; the original implementations of BLASTX,[9]\nTBLASTN[4]\nand TBLASTX (unpublished); the transparent use of external (plug-in) programs such as seg, xnu, and dust to mask low-complexity regions in query sequences at run time; the NCBI BLAST E-mail Service with optional public key-encrypted communications; the NCBI Experimental BLAST Network Service; the NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein and nucleotide sequence databases, typically updated on a daily basis with all data from GenBank, Swiss-Prot, and the PIR. Gish developed the first BLAST API, which was used in EST[10]\nannotation and Entrez data production, as well as in the NCBI BLAST version 1.4 application suite (Gish, unpublished). Gish was also the creator of and project manager for the earliest NCBI Dispatcher for distributed services (inspired by CORBA's Object Request Broker). First opened to outside users in December 1989, the NCBI Experimental BLAST Network Service, running the latest BLAST software on SMP hardware against the latest releases of the major sequence databases, quickly established the NCBI as a convenient, one-stop shop for sequence similarity searching./nAt Washington University in St. Louis, Gish revolutionized similarity searching by developing the first BLAST suite of programs to combine rapid gapped sequence alignment\nwith statistical evaluation methods appropriate for gapped alignment scores.\nThe resulting search programs were significantly more sensitive but only marginally slower than ungapped BLAST,\ndue to novel application of the BLAST dropoff score X during gapped alignment extension.\nSensitivity of gapped BLAST was further improved by the novel application\nof Karlin-Altschul Sum statistics[11]\nto the evaluation of multiple, gapped alignment scores in all BLAST search modes.\nSum statistics were originally developed analytically for the evaluation of multiple, ungapped alignment scores.\nThe empirical use of Sum statistics in the treatment of gapped alignment scores was validated in collaboration with Stephen Altschul, from 1994-1995.\nIn May 1996, WU-BLAST version 2.0 with gapped alignments was publicly released in the form of a drop-in upgrade for existing users of  ungapped NCBI BLAST and WU-BLAST (both at version 1.4, after having forked in 1994).\nLittle NIH funding was received for his WU-BLAST development, with an average of 20% FTE starting in November 1995, and ending shortly after the September 1997 release of the NCBI gapped BLAST (\u201cblastall\u201d).\nAs an option to WU-BLAST, Gish implemented a faster, more memory-efficient and more sensitive two-hit BLAST algorithm than was used by the NCBI software for many years.\nIn 1999, Gish added support to WU-BLAST for the Extended Database Format (XDF), the first BLAST database format capable of accurately representing the entire draft sequence of the human genome in full-length chromosome sequence objects.\nThis was also the first time any BLAST package introduced a new database format transparently to existing users, without abandoning support for prior formats, as a result of abstracting the database I/O functions away from the data analysis functions.\nWU-BLAST with XDF was the first BLAST suite to support indexed-retrieval of NCBI standard FASTA-format sequence identifiers (including the entire range of NCBI identifiers); the first\nto allow retrieval of individual sequences in part or in whole, natively, translated or reverse-complemented; and the first able to dump the entire contents of a BLAST database back into human-readable FASTA format.\nIn 2000, unique support for reporting of links (consistent sets of HSPs; also called chains in some later software packages) was added,\nalong with the ability for users to limit the distance between HSPs allowed in the same set to a biologically relevant length (e.g., the length of the expected longest intron in the species of interest)\nand with the distance limitation entering into the calculation of E-values.\nBetween 2001-2003, Gish improved the speed of the DFA code used in WU-BLAST.\nGish also proposed multiplexing query sequences to speed up BLAST searches by an order of magnitude or more (MPBLAST); implemented segmented sequences with internal sentinel bytes, in part to aid multiplexing with MPBLAST and in part to aid analysis of segmented query sequences from shotgun sequencing assemblies;\nand directed use of WU-BLAST as a fast, flexible search engine for accurately identifying and masking genome sequences for repetitive elements and low-complexity sequences (the MaskerAid[12] package for RepeatMasker).\nWith doctoral student Miao Zhang, Gish directed development of EXALIN,[13] which significantly improved the accuracy of spliced alignment predictions,\nby a novel approach that combined information from donor and acceptor splice site models with information from sequence conservation.\nAlthough EXALIN performed full dynamic programming by default, it could optionally utilize the output from WU-BLAST to seed the dynamic programming and speed up the process by about 100-fold with little loss of sensitivity or accuracy./nIn 2008, Gish founded Advanced Biocomputing, LLC, where he continues to improve and support the AB-BLAST package.[citation needed]", "36684321": "Vladimir Ivanovich Pyankov (31 March 1954 \u2013 1 February 2002) was a Russian phytophysiologist, professor of the Ural State University./nGreat contribution in studies of structural and functional methods of the ecological studies of photosynthesis has been made by V.

She is remembered for her contributions to education and a street in Tbilisi bears her name./nOlga Alexandres asuli Guramishvili (Olga daughter of Alexander Guramishvili) [Notes 1] was born on 29 July 1855 Lower Avchala, a northern suburb of Tiflis (known after 1936 as Tbilisi), in the Caucasus Viceroyalty of the Russian Empire[2] to Ketevan Tumanishvili and Alexander Guramishvili.[3] She was related to the Georgian poet Davit Guramishvili, and a relative and god-daughter of Olga Guramishvili-Chavchavadze\u00a0[ka], a Georgian literary figure, married to Ilia Chavchavadze. After completing her secondary education, Guramishvili attended the Tiflis Women's Gymnasium. Hoping to become an agronomy teacher, upon completing her high school studies, she attended biology lectures with Professor Tarkhnishvili.[2] At the time, there were few opportunities for university study for women in the Russian Empire, and Guramishvili dreamed of going abroad to further her education in Switzerland.[2][3] Her father was against the plan, but her mother encouraged Guramishvili,[3] who obtained the passport of Ephrosine Nikoladze, older sister of Niko Nikoladze, and made her way to Zurich[2][3] in 1872.[4]/nIn the early 1870s, Switzerland was a gathering place for Russian revolutionaries who were preaching the socialist doctrine.[2] Guramishvili, one of the first Georgian women to study abroad, became involved in the student movement and became active with other Georgian women students like Fefo Eliozishvili, Ekaterine Melikishvili, Pelagia Natsvlishvili, Ekaterine \"Kato\" and Olympiad Nikoladze, Mariam Tsereteli.

Its stated purpose was for students abroad to study socialist doctrine to liberate their homeland and form a republican state.[2] In 1874, the Tsarist regime issued a decree requiring woman students to leave the University of Zurich and return to their homelands.[4] Instead, Guramishvili left with Niko to study at the University of Geneva,[2] where members of the Yoke became more closely aligned with radical philosophies the intelligentsia in Western Europe and Russia.[3]/nThough Niko was interested in Guramishvili romantically, she was enjoying her freedom and studies.[2][5] Niko left Geneva and went to Paris, where he married a Polish woman, Bogumila Zemianskaia (also Bogumi\u0142a Ziemia\u0144ska), who had lived for a while in his hometown, Kutaisi. They had three children \u2014 a son who died young, and two daughters, Nino and Elizabeth, known as \"Lolo\".[2][6] He and Guramishvili began a correspondence at this period, which would last throughout their lives.[2] Becoming a socialist, Guramishvili regularly attended the International Workingmen's Association section meetings where they discussed such issues as nationalism, internationalism, women's suffrage and equality, as well as the socio-economic and political policies of the Paris Commune. Many of the lectures focused on the doctrine of Karl Marx. In his memoir, revolutionary figure, Nikolai Morozov, wrote that Kato Nikoladze, Mashiko Tsereteli and Guramishvili were to be found as a trio at almost every gathering of Geneva's international community or French communists. After completing her degree in pedagogy,[3] Guramishvili briefly lived in Saint Petersburg, but was expelled from Russia for her involvement with Nikolay Mikhaylovsky and the Narodniks.[2]/nReturning to Georgia in 1875, Guramishvili began working at the boys' gymnasium operated by Iakob Gogebashvili. Initially, the other instructors opposed the hiring of a woman, but her training soon earned her admiration.[2] Around the same time, Niko, who had been living between Paris and Tiflis since 1871, establishing and writing for a number of revolutionary periodicals, returned to Georgia.[7] After teaching at the gymnasium for five years, Guramishvili left in 1880 and accompanied Niko when he was arrested and exiled to Stavropol, though he did not refrain from his radical publishing activities.[2][7] In 1881, they relocated to Saint Petersburg,[3] though they were unable to marry. Divorce was a difficult process in the period and required permission from the Holy Synod.[6] Niko and Zemianskaia were formally separated in the early summer of 1883, and on 29 July, he and Guramishvili married at the Kashveti Church in Tiflis.[2] The following year, their daughter Rusudan\u00a0[ka] (1884\u20131981) was born in Saint Petersburg.[8]/nIn 1886 or 1887, the family moved to Didi Jikhaishi,[2][9] (sometimes known as Didi-Dzhikhaishi),[10] in the Imereti region of western Georgia.[2][9] Guramishvili opened a girls' school which introduced new teaching methods, bringing in teachers from Tiflis to help advance her ideas.[2] One of these was Nino Tkeshelashvili, who she hired as a teacher for Russian language.[11] The couples' other children, Giorgi\u00a0[ka] (1888\u20131931) and Tamar (1892\u20131939) were born during this time.[12][13] In 1894, she opened a women's gymnasium, which focused on agricultural sciences. Bringing in silk worms from Lyon, France, she taught sericulture as well as machine knitting and weaving to her students.[5] Later that year, they moved to Poti, where Niko served as mayor[6] until 1912.[14] While they were living in Poti, Guramishvili continued her focus on education, serving as the chair of the school board.[5]/nBy 1916,[Notes 2] Niko was working in Saint Petersburg, having taken a post on the board of Russkaia volia (Russian Liberty), a leading left-leaning journal. When the February Revolution began, the family immediately supported the creation of the Provisional Committee of the State Duma and both daughters began working as telephone operators for the new Soviet leadership. [16] In the spring, Niko and Guramishvili returned to Tiflis, where he became one of the founders of the National Democratic Party.[17] On 5 September, Rusudan left newly renamed Petrograd with her son to return to the family home in Didi Jikhaishi and avoid the turmoil of the revolution.[18] She began working as a teacher at the gymnasium her mother had founded.[8] When Georgia gained its independence in 1918, Niko became a member of the Constituent Assembly and served until 1921. When the Soviets invaded Georgia, the family moved to London for three years, before returning to Tiflis, where Niko died in 1928.[7]/nGuramishvili died on 24 May 1940 in Tbilisi. In 1957, her remains were moved to the Mtatsminda Pantheon where her husband Niko had been buried.[3] She is remembered as one of the first Georgian women to study abroad and introduce pedagogy to Georgia. More than 7,000 of the letters exchanged by Guramishvili and Nikoladze are extant and housed in an archive in the United States.[2][5] A small portion of them was published as \u10de\u10d8\u10e8\u10e3 \u10e2\u10d4\u10d1\u10d4 by I. A. Meskhi.[2] In 2018, the Tbilisi City Council renamed a section of Theodore Afanasiev Street in the Isani District of the city in her honor.[19] Her daughter Rusudan became a chemist and married Russian historian Mikhail Polievktov.[20] Giorgi became a well-known mathematician.[13] Tamar, an academic, physiologist and one of the first women in Georgia to participate in international sporting events, married one of Giorgi's colleagues, Nikoloz Muskhelishvili.[13][21]", "7586354": "Sir John Struthers MD FRCSE FRSE ((1823-02-21)21 February 1823 \u2013 (1899-02-24)24 February 1899) was the first Regius Professor of Anatomy at the University of Aberdeen. He was a dynamic teacher and administrator, transforming the status of the institutions in which he worked.

Struthers took every opportunity he could to dissect it and recover its bones, and eventually wrote a monograph on it./nIn the medical profession, he was known for transforming the teaching of anatomy, for the papers and books that he wrote, as well as for his efficient work in his medical school, for which he was successively awarded medicine's highest honours, including membership of the General Medical Council, fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the presidency of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, and finally a knighthood./nJohn Struthers was the son of Alexander Struthers (1767\u20131853) and his wife Mary Reid (1793\u20131859).[2] They lived in Brucefield, a large stone-built 18th century house with spacious grounds, which was then just outside Dunfermline; John was born in the house.[3] Alexander was a wealthy mill owner and linen merchant. He bought Brucefield early in the 19th century, along with Brucefield Mill, a linen spinning mill built in 1792. Flax for linen was threshed at the nearby threshing mill, and bleached in the open air near the house. There were still linen bleachers living in Brucefield House in 1841, but they had gone by 1851, leaving the house as the seat of the Struthers family.[3] Mary's father, Deacon John Reid, was also a linen maker. Alexander and Mary were married in 1818; the marriage, though not warmly affectionate, lasted until Alexander's death despite the large age difference. Both Alexander and Mary are buried at Dunfermline Abbey.[4]:\u200a76/nStruthers was one of six children, three boys and three girls. The boys were privately tutored in the classics, mathematics and modern languages at home in Brucefield House. They went out boating in summer, skating in winter on the nearby dam; they rode ponies, went swimming in the nearby Firth of Forth, and went for long walks with wealthy friends.[4]:\u200a76\u200a Both his older brother James and his younger brother Alexander studied medicine. James Struthers became a doctor at Leith Hospital. Alexander Struthers died of cholera while serving as a doctor in the Crimean War. His sisters, Janet and Christina, provided a simple education at Brucefield for some poor friends, Daniel and James Thomson. Daniel (1833\u20131908) became a Dunfermline weaver as well as a historian and reformer.[4]:\u200a71/nStruthers studied medicine at Edinburgh University, winning prizes as an undergraduate. He completed his doctorate (M.D.) in 1845, becoming a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh at the same time. In 1847, the college licensed him and his brother James to teach anatomy in the Edinburgh Extramural School of Medicine. The courses that they taught at the medical school in Argyle Square, Edinburgh were recognized by the examining bodies of England, Scotland and Ireland.[4]:\u200a77/nHe worked his way up at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary from \"dresser\" (surgical assistant), to surgical clerk, to house physician, house surgeon and finally full surgeon. His passion was for anatomy; he told the story of how he had been so concentrated on an anatomy dissection one day in 1843 that he failed to look outside to observe the street procession known as the \"Disruption\" which launched the Free Church of Scotland. He became Lecturer of Anatomy at the University of Edinburgh.[4]:\u200a77/nFrom 1860 Struthers was joined by William Pirrie at the university, who worked alongside Struthers as Professor of Surgery.[5]/nIn 1863, Struthers became the first Regius Professor of Anatomy at the University of Aberdeen.[6][7][2] This was a \"Crown Chair\" (a professorship recognized by the government), a prestigious position. Struthers' application for the chair was supported by over 250 letters, many from public figures including well-known doctors such as Joseph Lister and James Paget, and politicians such as Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, who became Home Secretary, and James Moncreiff, who became the Scottish Lord Advocate.[note 1] The support of these men was actively solicited by Struthers' well-connected friends and relatives, including his cousin the Reverend John Struthers of Prestonpans, and his energetic wife Christina. With the success of their campaign, the family moved to Aberdeen.[4]:\u200a77/nStruthers held the professorship at Aberdeen for 26 years. In that time, he radically transformed anatomy teaching at the university, improved the Aberdeen medical school; set up the museum of anatomy; and helped to lead the reconstruction of the Aberdeen Infirmary. He vigorously collected specimens for his museum, \"prepared or otherwise provided, mainly by the work of my own hands, and at my own expense\". The specimens were arranged to enable students to compare the anatomy of different animals. He intended the comparative anatomy exhibits to demonstrate evolution through the presence of homologous structures. For example, in mammals, the arm and hand of a human, the wing of a bird, the foreleg of a horse, and the flipper of a whale are all homologous forelimbs. He continually made demands of the University of Aberdeen's Senate for additional room space and money for the museum, against the wishes of his colleagues in the faculty.[8] Struthers could go to great lengths to obtain specimens he particularly wanted, and on at least one occasion this led to court action. He had long admired a crocodile skeleton at Aberdeen's Medico-Chirurgical Society. In 1866 he borrowed it, ostensibly to clean and remount it, but despite the society's urgent requests to have it returned, it stayed in Struthers' museum at Marischal College for ten years. Struthers still hoped to obtain the specimen, and when in 1885 he was made president of the Medico-Chirurgical Society, he again tried to take the crocodile to his museum. The society then obtained an interdict (a court order) restraining him from removing the skeleton.[9][10]/nStruthers published about 70 papers on anatomy. He set up a popular series of lectures for the public, held on Saturday evenings.[4]:\u200a78\u200a Many of the methods he used remain relevant today. He had a powerful effect on medical education in Britain, in 1890 establishing the format of three years of \"pre-clinical\" academic teaching and examination in the sciences underlying medicine, including especially anatomy. His system lasted until the reform of medical training in 1993 and 2003. His 21st century successors at the anatomy school in Aberdeen write that \"He would undoubtedly be greatly dismayed at the drastic reduction in the teaching of basic medical sciences, and the subsequent perceived decline in the anatomical knowledge of medical students and practicing clinicians,\" and they quote one of Struthers' sayings to his students:[9][10]/nUnless you are well informed in the foundation sciences and principles, you may practise your profession, but you will never understand disease and its treatment; your practice will be routine, the unintelligent application of the dogmas and directions of your textbook or teacher.[11]/nStruthers was one of the first advocates of the theory of evolution, speaking publicly[13] and corresponding with Charles Darwin[14] about observations he made during his comparative anatomy studies./nStruthers was interested in abnormal variations in anatomy, such as additional toes, and he collected many specimens which he offered to show Darwin. Among other curiosities, Struthers described the \"Ligament of Struthers\", a rare extra band of connective tissue present in 1% of humans running from a bony projection on the humerus down to the elbow,[15] and showed that its presence was inherited.[16][17][18][19]/nThe significance of Struthers' ligament, as Darwin and Struthers understood, is that the vestigial organ has no function in humans, but is inherited from a structure, the supra-condyloid foramen, which certainly had a function in other mammals including marsupials and carnivores. In those other mammals, the supra-condyloid foramen is an opening in the bone that important structures, the median nerve and the brachial artery, run through. Struthers observed that when his ligament was present in humans, the nerve and artery did run through it. Darwin took this to mean that the human structure was homologous with the foramen in other mammals, and that therefore humans and other mammals had a common ancestor. He used Struthers' work as evidence in Chapter 1 of his Descent of Man (1871):[15][20]/nIn some of the lower Quadrumana, in the Lemuridae and Carnivora, as well as in many marsupials, there is a passage near the lower end of the humerus, called the supra-condyloid foramen, through which the great nerve of the fore limb and often the great artery pass. Now in the humerus of man, there is generally a trace of this passage, which is sometimes fairly well developed, being formed by a depending hook-like process of bone, completed by a band of ligament. Dr. Struthers, who has closely attended to the subject, has now shewn that this peculiarity is sometimes inherited, as it has occurred in a father, and in no less than four out of his seven children. When present, the great nerve invariably passes through it; and this clearly indicates that it is the homologue and rudiment of the supra-condyloid foramen of the lower animals. Prof. Turner estimates, as he informs me, that it occurs in about one per cent of recent skeletons. But if the occasional development of this structure in man is, as seems probable, due to reversion, it is a return to a very ancient state of things, because in the higher Quadrumana it is absent.[20][note 2]/nAberdeen, a coastal city, gave Struthers the opportunity to observe the whales which were from time to time washed up on Scotland's coast. In 1870 he observed, dissected and described a blue whale (which he called a \"Great Fin-Whale\") from Peterhead. He brought the entire skeleton of a sei whale back to the anatomy department at Aberdeen, where for a century it was suspended overhead in the hall. He vigorously collected examples of a wide range of species to form a museum of zoology, with the intention of illustrating Darwin's theories. As an energetic and forceful personality with a strong enthusiasm for zoology, he alarmed his colleagues at the University of Aberdeen by constantly asking for money and space to acquire and house his collection.[8][21]/nStruthers became known to the general public for his dissection of the \"Tay Whale\", one of his largest specimens.[8]/nAt the end of December 1883, a humpback whale appeared in the Firth of Tay off Dundee, attracting much local interest. It was harpooned, but after an all-night struggle escaped. A week later it was found dead, and was towed on to the beach at Stonehaven, near Aberdeen. Struthers quickly visited the carcass, measuring it as 40 feet long with a tail 11 feet 4 inches wide. Struthers was not able to start dissecting it at once, as a local entrepreneur, John Woods, bought the whale and took it to his yard in Dundee, where on the first Sunday, 12,000 people paid to see it.[8]/nStruthers was not allowed to dissect the famous specimen until it was too badly decomposed for further public exhibition.[note 3] He was well used to working on stinking carcasses: his dissecting room was reputed to stink \"like the deck of a Greenland whaler\".[22] The dissection was disturbed by John Woods, who admitted the public, for a fee, to watch Struthers and his assistants at work, with a military band playing in the background. Progress on the dissection was impeded by snow showers. Struthers was able to remove much of the skeleton before Woods had the flesh embalmed; the carcass was then stuffed and sewn up to be taken on a profitable tour as far as Edinburgh and London. After months of waiting, on 7 August 1884, Struthers was able to remove the skull and the rest of the skeleton. Over the next decade, Struthers wrote seven anatomy articles on the whale, with a complete monograph on it in 1889.[8]/nStruthers' siblings included James Struthers MD (1821\u20131891), a doctor at Leith hospital for 42 years, and his youngest brother Alexander Struthers MB who died at Scutari Hospital in Istanbul during the Crimean War.[23]/nStruthers married Christina Margaret Alexander (born 15 January 1833) on 5 August 1857. Christina was the sister of John Alexander, chief clerk to Bow Street Police Court. She too came from a Scottish medical family; her parents were Dr James Alexander (1795\u20131863) and Margaret Finlay (1797\u20131865), both of old Dunfermline families; James practised as a surgeon just across the English border in the small town of Wooler, Northumberland.[4]:\u200a77\u200a On James' death as a \"country practitioner\", the city-dweller Struthers wrote[24]/nThe great majority of the profession are and must be country practitioners; the hardest work of the profession is done by them; in the winter nights, when the world is asleep, they have many a long and weary drive; they are far from libraries, from hospitals and museums, and from societies; and thus in their comparative isolation want that stimulus and guidance which tend to keep the city practitioner up to the mark.[24]/nStruthers was father-in-law of nitroglycerine chemist David Orme Masson, who married his daughter Mary. He was grandfather of another explosives chemist, Sir James Irvine Orme Masson, and father-in-law of educator Simon Somerville Laurie, who married his daughter Lucy.[25][26]/nOn retiring from the University of Aberdeen, Struthers returned to Edinburgh. He lived at 15 George Square.[27]/nHe was buried in the north-east section of the central roundel of Warriston Cemetery, Edinburgh, in 1899; his wife Christina joined him there in 1907. The grave faces over a path to that of his brother, James Struthers./nAll three of their sons, Alexander, James and John also worked in the medical profession; John William Struthers followed his uncle James by working at Leith Hospital, and followed his father by working at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and by becoming president of the Royal College of Surgeons.[4]:\u200a79/nIn 1852 Struthers was elected a member of the Harveian Society of Edinburgh and served as president in 1894.[28] He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by the University of Glasgow in 1885 for his work in medical education.[4]:\u200a78\u200a[2] In 1892 he was given honorary membership of the Royal Medical Society; he also became president of the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh.[4]:\u200a78\u200a He was appointed to the General Medical Council in 1883 and remained a member until 1891.[4]:\u200a78\u200a He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1894.[29] In 1895 he was made president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh; he held the position for two years.[4]:\u200a78\u200a In 1898, he was knighted (as Sir John Struthers) by Queen Victoria for his service to medicine.[4]:\u200a78\u200a[30][31]/nGlasgow University's Struthers Medal is named in his honour.[32]/nStruthers authored over 70 manuscripts and books, including the following.", "44843579": "Eduardo D.

Lancaster. His team was the first to demonstrate that organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) can be used to model human disease, a breakthrough that was ranked within the top 10 scientific discoveries in 2013 by Science magazine.[10]/nThis model is now commonly referred to as \u201cCerebral organoids\u201d. It recapitulates the early steps of human brain development during the first trimester and has been used by many other research groups.[11][12] Organoid models enable researches to perform studies directly on human tissues that can be grown from any human individual.[13] They allow scientists to efficiently transfer research findings from fruit flies and animal models to human tissues and thus to investigate heritable genetic brain diseases on human tissue./nSince 2013 his team have developed cerebral organoids. In 2017, they showed that by fusing two separately patterned organoids it is possible to study interactions between distinct brain areas.[14]/nPreviously, his research had also centered around the mechanisms of brain development. His were neuronal stem cells, their asymmetrical cell division and processes of growth control. Building on his post-doctoral work, Knoblich and his colleagues characterized a complete mechanism for asymmetrical stem cell division in neural stem cells of the fruitfly Drosophila. Their results were published in a series of seminal papers, including a report in Cell in 2008.[15] Until then, it was unknown how stem cells can separate into a self-renewing daughter cell and a specialized differentiating cell at the same time. Asymmetric cell division is based on a reaction cascade in which a cascade of molecular switches are activated or inactivated. Proteins in this cascade are either turned \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d depending on their phosphorylation state, starting with a kinase that transfers the first phosphate residue, named aurora kinase A. Aurora kinase A is often over-expressed in tumor cells, alongside other molecules that also play a role in the process of asymmetric cell division. Since stem cell mitosis is a highly conserved process, results found in fruit flies can be transferred to humans and thereby help to gain insights into general tumor neogenesis[16]/nAdditionally, Knoblich and his group were the first to carry out a genome-wide in vivo RNAi screen to demonstrate for the first time, that it is possible to simultaneously analyze gene functions across the whole genome of an organism in a tissue specific manner.[17] This was achieved using a fruit fly gene bank generated at IMBA by Barry Dickson, in which every single one of the approximately 13,000 fruit fly genes can be inactivated in any cell independently. These findings have been published in Nature in 2009.[18] With this method, Knoblich could further elucidate brain tumor development in fruit flies. Recent findings suggest that tumors can be based on stem cells, that keep their unique stem cell characteristics and thus uncontrollably divide, without ever differentiating into specific somatic cell types. This lack of differentiation is caused by Brat, a gene that has been identified by Knoblich and his team.[19] It is currently unknown how many genes with a similar function exist in humans.

His 2016 book Dance to the Tune of Life sets these ideas out in a broad sweep from the general principle of relativity applied to biology, through to the role of purpose in evolution and to the relativity of epistemology.[citation needed]/nHe contrasts Dawkins's famous statement in The Selfish Gene (\"Now they [genes] swarm ... safe inside gigantic lumbering robots ... they created us, body and mind; and their preservation is the ultimate rationale for our existence\") with an alternative view: \"Now they [genes] are trapped in huge colonies, locked inside highly intelligent beings, moulded by the outside world, communicating with it by complex processes, through which, blindly, as if by magic, function emerges.  They are in you and me; we are the system that allows their code to be read; and their preservation is totally dependent on the joy we experience in reproducing ourselves.  We are the ultimate rationale for their existence\".  He then suggests that there is no empirical difference between these statements, and says that they differ in \"metaphor\" and \"sociological or polemical viewpoint\".[25]/nHe argues that \"the paradigms for genetic causality in biological systems are seriously confused\" and that \"The metaphors that served us well during the molecular biological phase of recent decades have limited or even misleading impacts in the multilevel world of systems biology. New paradigms are needed if we are to succeed in unravelling multifactorial genetic causation at higher levels of physiological function and so to explain the phenomena that genetics was originally about.\"[26]/nNoble has called for an extended evolutionary synthesis, and more controversially a replacement for the modern synthesis known as The Third Way of Evolution (TWE).[9][27][28]/nHe has argued that from research in epigenetics, acquired characteristics can be inherited and in contrast to the modern synthesis, genetic change is \"far from random\" and not always gradual. He has also claimed that the central dogma of molecular biology has been broken as an \"embodiment of the Weismann Barrier\",[29] and a new synthesis will integrate research from physiology with evolutionary biology.[30][31][32][33][34]/nNoble and James A. Shapiro established The Third Way of Evolution (TWE) project in 2014. The TWE which is also known as the \"Integrated Synthesis\" shares many similarities with the extended evolutionary synthesis but is more extreme in its claims.[9] The TWE consists of a group of researchers who provide a \"Third Way\" alternative to creationism and the modern synthesis. The TWE predicts that the modern synthesis will be replaced with an entirely new evolutionary framework. Similar to the extended evolutionary synthesis (EES), advocates cite examples of developmental bias, genetic assimilation, niche construction, non-genetic inheritance, phenotypic plasticity and other evolutionary processes.[9] Shapiro's natural genetic engineering, a process described to account for novelty created in biological evolution is also important for the TWE.[33][34][35] The difference between the extended synthesis and the TWE is that the latter calls for an entire replacement of the modern synthesis rather than an extension.[9]/nIn 2023, evolutionary biologist Erik Svensson commented that \"to date, there are few leading evolutionary biologists who have openly embraced the TWE\" and it is unlikely that an entire replacement of the modern synthesis will occur as there has been little visibility of such a forthcoming paradigm shift during the past decade.[9]/nIn 2022, the HowTheLightGetsIn Festival at Hay-on-Wye featured Noble and Richard Dawkins in a \"conversation\" on evolution.[36]/nNoble has proposed Ten Principles of Systems Biology:[37][38]/nNoble has published over 600 articles in academic journals,[1][19] including Nature,[10][11][48][49][50][51] Science,[52][53] PNAS,[54] Journal of Physiology,[55][56][57][58][59] Progress in Biophysics & Molecular Biology;[60] Many articles in national press.

He was the inventor of the 'Marquis' wheat cultivar. Saunders Secondary School in London, Ontario is named for him and other members of his prominent family, including his father, agriculturist William Saunders and naturalist brother William Edwin Saunders./nSaunders was born in London, Canada West, on February 2, 1867,[1] son of William and Sarah Agnes Robinson Saunders. He received his early education in the elementary and collegiate system in London. He received a Bachelor of Arts in chemistry from the University of Toronto in 1888. From 1888 to 1893, he specialized in chemistry at summer school at Harvard University. In 1891, he received a Ph.D for chemistry from Johns Hopkins University. He studied at the Sorbonne./nSaunders learned most of what he knew about plant hybridization at home through his family. Some of his earliest memories are of driving with his father to a fruit farm outside the city limits, where he would help him hybridize grapes, currants, raspberries, and gooseberries./nSaunders married Mary Blackwell of Toronto in 1892./nFrom 1892 to 1893, Saunders was the professor of chemistry and geology at Central University in Kentucky. Between 1894 and 1903, he studied flute with E. M. Heindl of the Boston Symphony Orchestra at the New England Conservatory of Music and with Eugene Weiner of the New York Philharmonic Club. He also received voice training. In Toronto, in addition to acting as an agent, he gave lessons in singing and flute playing. In 1895-1896 Saunders was a columnist in The Week, writing about various aspects of music. His musical career was not a financial success, however./nIn 1903, William Saunders, Charles' father, appointed him Experimentalist at the Experimental Farm in Ottawa in 1903, a title that became Cerealist in 1905 and Dominion Cerealist in 1910. The new work continued family tradition, for Saunders's father had founded the system of experimental farms established in Canada,[1] and his brother, Percy, had done considerable work in cross-breeding strains of wheat./nSaunders turned enthusiastically to his new tasks. Following up his brother's research, he completed development of 'Marquis' wheat in 1904, a cultivar which showed marked superiority in milling quality for bread flour over other varieties popular in western Canada. 'Marquis' had the advantage of maturing 10 days earlier than its competitors - a factor of great importance in the Canadian wheat belt. The Indian Head Experimental Farm in Saskatchewan raised 'Marquis' wheat for seed, and by 1909 its use was widespread. By 1920, 90% of the wheat grown in western Canada was 'Marquis'. However, 'Marquis' was not resistant to stem rust. In seeking newer and better varieties Saunders developed three other strains of wheat - 'Ruby', 'Garnet', and 'Reward' - specifically adapted to prairie conditions. He was also responsible for improved varieties of oats and barley./nIn the search for a hardy wheat that would mature faster, he made hundreds of crosses, proceeding to test the yields.[2] Tests included one called \"chewing\", whereby Saunders identified strains with strong gluten by chewing a few sample kernels. \"I made more wheat into gum than was made by all the boys in any dozen rural schools of a generation ago.\"[3]/nUsing a technique he devised himself, Saunders ground his own flour and baked his own bread in small loaves to measure volume./nWorking with 'Red Fife', which had been imported and developed by David Fife from Ontario, Saunders crossed it with 'Hard Red Calcutta'. The new cultivar 'Markham' showed great promise, but its offspring were not uniform. After many trials at the Agassiz experimental farm, a winner emerged - 'Marquis'./nIn 1906, surplus 'Marquis' seed was shipped to Indian Head, Saskatchewan, for additional testing./nIn 1911, 'Marquis' won the Canadian Pacific Railway Prize of $1,000.00 for the best bushel of hard spring wheat grown in North America. This was the first of many prizes./nThe only drawback of 'Marquis' was its susceptibility to rust. Not until 1947 was a rust-resistant variety developed at the Central Experimental Farm in Ottawa. It was named 'Saunders'./nBy 1920, 90% of the wheat crop in western Canada was 'Marquis'./nSaunders also applied his methods to barley, oats, peas, beans, and flax, introducing several new cultivars of each./nHe wrote extensively on the subject and many of his thoughts on cereals were presented to scientific conferences and societies and printed in scientific magazines./nIn 1922, after suffering a physical breakdown, Saunders resigned his position and moved to Paris with his wife./nFrom 1922 to 1925, he studied French literature at the Sorbonne. In the latter year, he returned to Ottawa briefly, but in 1928 he moved to Toronto. Though retired, he continued to lecture on 'Marquis' wheat and the French language./nIn 1928, Essais et vers, a collection of Saunders' French essays and poems, was published by Louis Carrier and Cie, Les Editions du Mercure, in Montreal and New York. The work received critical acclaim in the French press, especially in Quebec./nSaunders died in Toronto on July 25, 1937.[1] Tributes to him came from around the world.

Two thugs working for Nathan Ellery, head of the criminal organization the Conclave, barge into Alec's lab, knock him out, and plant a bomb in the facility. Alec wakes up as the bomb explodes. In flames, he runs into the swamp. His body is drenched in the bio-restorative formula, and this affects the plant life of the swamp, imbuing it with Alec's consciousness and memories. The newly conscious plant life forms a semblance of a human and rises up from the bog as the Swamp Thing, the latest in a long line of Earth elementals created when the Green is in need of protection./nThe Swamp Thing originally thinks that he is Alec Holland, transformed by the freak accident into a monster. He seeks to regain his human body, but often meets opposition in the form of Anton Arcane and his ever-growing legion of \"Un-Men\". After finally defeating Arcane, the Swamp Thing is set upon by General Sunderland's men in a covert military operation. The resulting attacks blast a hole in the Swamp Thing's head and destroys the lives of many of his friends. Sunderland brings the Swamp Thing's body back to Sunderland Corp to study and unlock the secret of the bio-restorative formula./nSunderland hires the Floronic Man to study the Swamp Thing's body, which he stores in a cryochest. Over the course of his research, the Floronic Man deduces that the Swamp Thing is a plant that thinks it is Alec Holland; the real Alec Holland died in the explosion. Sunderland and the Floronic Man part on bad terms, so the scientist uses Sunderland's automated computer systems to raise the thermostat in the Swamp Thing's cryochest. This allows the Swamp Thing's body to regenerate, and in his search for Sunderland, he stumbles across the Floronic Man's report, which sends him into a mindless rage. He kills Sunderland and sets off for the swamps./nThe Swamp Thing goes into shock from learning his true origins. He roots himself into the swamp and spends three weeks dreaming; his mind eventually travels into the Green. The Floronic Man returns to the swamp and discovers the Swamp Thing's connection to the Green, but the experience drives him mad. Consuming parts of Swamp Thing's body (which regenerate themselves or are basically superfluous to his continued existence), Floronic Man is able to influence plant growth to the extent all plants on Earth essentially become hostile to humanity. When the Swamp Thing realizes the presence of the Floronic Man's corrupting influence there, he wrenches himself back into reality. He catches up with the Floronic Man and convinces the villain that his war against animal life is pointless, reminding him that plant life and animal life need each other to survive./nA budding friendship grows between the Swamp Thing and Abby Cable, the niece of his dead nemesis Anton Arcane. Her husband Matthew grows resentful of her disinterest in sex and turns to alcohol, further pushing her toward the Swamp Thing. She asks for his help when her autistic students at Elysium Lawns are tormented by Kamara the Monkey King. The Swamp Thing destroys the demon with the help of Etrigan the Demon. On the same night that the demon attacks, Matthew leaves to help Abby. His alcoholism causes him to crash his car, mortally wounding him. To stay alive, he makes a pact with the spirit of Anton Arcane, who possesses his body./nLater, the Swamp Thing is visited by the ghost of Alec Holland and learns that Alec's skeleton is still lying at the bottom of the bayou. Diving down, the Swamp Thing retrieves the bones and gives them a proper burial. This allows Alec's spirit to free itself from the Earthly plane and ascend into Heaven./nAfter weeks, Abigail realizes that the man she thought was her husband is actually her Uncle Anton. Her feeling of disgust sends her into a horrible shock. The Swamp Thing confronts the possessed Matthew, and with the guidance of the monster, discovers Abby's body. Enraged that Arcane sent the \"soul\" of his niece to Hell, the Swamp Thing beats Arcane to a pulp, allowing Matthew's trapped spirit to cast the soul of the sorcerer out of his body and back to the netherworld. The returns Matthew's control of his body but leaves him comatose./nTo set things right, the Swamp Thing travels into the Green, the Spirit World, and Hell, all to reclaim Abby's soul. He is forced to fight off a legion of the damned, including Anton Arcane, but he prevails again with the help of Etrigan. After Abby returns to life, the Swamp Thing and Abby confess their love for each other. To celebrate the beginning of their relationship, the Swamp Thing grows hallucinogenic tubers for Abby to eat, enabling her to see the world as he does./nThe Swamp Thing's body is destroyed after an encounter with Nukeface, a man saturated by dangerous levels of radiation. He sends his mind into the Green to attempt to form another body, and with Abby's help and weeks of effort, the Swamp Thing reforms most of his new body. In the meantime, occultist John Constantine the Hellblazer hears news of a coming danger and finds his way to the swamp. Upon meeting the Swamp Thing, he informs the creature that it is a plant elemental. Constantine hints at knowing much more about the nature of the Swamp Thing than he is saying and promises to discuss the matters further if the Swamp Thing meets him in Rosewood, Illinois, in a week's time./nConstantine informs the Swamp Thing that he has not completely destroyed the vampire population of Rosewood during his last encounter with them, and a number of them adapted to live within an aquatic environment. The Swamp Thing remembers that running water can destroy the vampires; they can only live underwater because the body of water covering Rosewood is stagnant. To deal with them, the Swamp Thing extends his abilities further than ever before, forming a new body from a mountain and letting its river merge with Rosewood's, thereby wiping the vampires out. Rather than provide any new information, Constantine tells the Swamp Thing to meet him in Maine in two weeks' time./nIn Kennescook, Maine, the Swamp Thing encounters Phoebe, a werewolf filled with outrage on behalf of abused and oppressed women throughout history. He prevents her from killing her husband, but is forced to watch helplessly as she kills herself. Constantine arrives soon after and tells the Swamp Thing to go back home to Louisiana./nAbby finds work on the set of a soap opera being filmed on the old Robertaland Plantation. Things went awry when the lead actors became possessed by the spirits of the murderous landowners. Dead slaves that worked on the plantation rose from the grave as zombies. Sensing the evil there, the Swamp Thing burns Robertaland to the ground after realizing that it is the source of their power./nEventually, the Swamp Thing sees a pattern emerging in all the monstrosities he has been confronting across America, but admits he needs Constantine to explain it to him. Constantine instructs him to travel to San Miguel, California, promising that this will be the last leg of their mission before he reveals everything that he knows./nIn San Miguel, the Swamp Thing visits the abandoned Cambridge mansion, haunted by every person ever to have been killed by the Cambridge repeater firearm. A group of thrill-seekers were menaced by the ghosts. The Swamp Thing managed to exorcise the ghosts from the mansion by making the sound of a hammer on a big table within. Afterward, Constantine appears and explained that he wanted the Swamp Thing to see first-hand the effects that the coming Crisis is having on Earth./nThe Swamp Thing and Constantine witnesses the effects of the Crisis: blood-red skies, and people and beasts from many different time periods, displaced into the present day. The pair were suddenly teleported to the Monitor's satellite by Alexander Luthor Jr. Constantine introduced the Swamp Thing to Alexander, who had formed a plan to ensure that reality survived the Crisis. Constantine promised that the Swamp Thing would likewise ensure that the spiritual realms survived the aftereffects of the Crisis./nConstantine revealed that after the Crisis ended, reality would be unstable and vulnerable for a time. Meanwhile, the ancient cult of the Brujeria were taking advantage of this situation to summon the Shadow Creature which would destroy Heaven. To do so the Brujeria needed to encourage a worldwide belief in monsters and the darker things in life. They were the ones responsible for the rash of nightmarish incidents that the Swamp Thing had contained over the past few weeks./nHe plans for he and the Swamp Thing to travel to South America and battle the cult - but first he wants the Swamp Thing to visit the Parliament of Trees in Tef\u00e9, Brazil, where he promises that he would finally learn the truth about his nature as a plant elemental. The Swamp Thing bids farewell to Abby for a while, and as they kissed, they are unaware that amateur photojournalist Howard Fleck is taking pictures of them./nThe Swamp Thing travels to Brazil, where he meets the Parliament of Trees. There, he encounters one of the previous plant elementals, Alex Olsen. Olsen explained that the Swamp Thing is the latest in a long line of plant elementals, who had all since joined the Parliament in their retirement. Communing with the others, the Swamp Thing is able to learn the histories of his predecessors./nJoining up with Constantine, the Swamp Thing manages to destroy the Brujeria by flooding their caves with dirt and crushing them with tree roots. His decision to save Constantine's life provided the Brujeria with enough time to send their messenger to awaken the Shadow Creature. Constantine and the Swamp Thing scramble to come up with a plan to deal with the Great Evil Beast, and then split up./nThe Swamp Thing travels through the Green to the afterlife, recruiting the help of Deadman, the Phantom Stranger, the Spectre and Etrigan. Together, they prepare to make a stand against the Great Evil Beast in Hell. One by one, the Swamp Thing's allies fell to the Beast, failing to answer its questions - that is, until the Swamp Thing tries entering it of his own free will, with peaceful intent./nReflecting on what the Parliament taught him about nature, he offered insights to the Great Evil Beast that its place in the universe is necessary; that good would grow stronger by its opposition to evil. His talk sparks something in the Great Evil Beast. When it finally reaches Heaven, the Great Evil Beast and the Presence join in an alliance of balance, changing the nature of good and evil for the entire universe./nBack in Louisiana, the Swamp Thing met with John Constantine again. The Swamp Thing is distressed to learn that in his absence, Howard Fleck had released the photos of him and Abby, causing such a scandal that she ran away to Gotham City. The Louisiana police had charged her with obscenity and crimes against nature, and it became Gotham's job to hold her trial and extradite her./nThe Swamp Thing sped to Gotham to free Abby from jail. He burst into the Gotham courthouse and demanded Abby's release. When his demand is refused, he tapped into the Green, using his immense elemental power to cause Gotham to become overgrown with plant life. In this way, he kept the city hostage until his wife is released./nIn the meantime, the Batman asked the Swamp Thing to turn Gotham back to normal, and the refusal of the creature leads to a fight in which the much-outmatched Batman is defeated. Finally, the Batman convinces the mayor that Abby had not committed any crime, and that it would be in the best interest of everyone if charges against her were dropped. In response, the Swamp Thing removes the overgrowth from Gotham./nAs the Swamp Thing is about to be reunited with Abby, he is attacked by Dwight Wicker and the Defense Department Intelligence, who wants to avenge the death of General Sunderland. They cut him off from the Green using a communications scrambler provided by Lex Luthor. Then, they set him aflame with napalm./nLocked out of the Green's frequency, the Swamp Thing survives the attempted assassination by tuning into a different, alien one. He managed to grow a new body on a planet populated by only blue vegetation, unconnected to the Green. He stayed on the planet for a time, exploring it and even creating plant-replicas of people he knew from Earth to keep him company. Finding this to be ultimately pointless, he destroyed his creations and gathered up the courage to try and grow a new plant-body elsewhere in the universe./nHe finds his way to the planet Rann, where he meets and befriends Adam Strange. The planet is going through a devastating drought, and there were arrangements made to find a solution with the Thanagarians. The Swamp Thing reached down under the surface of the planet and brought its plant life back./nHe attempted to grow a body from vegetation on a planet which seemed to be techno-organic. However, unbeknownst to him, the planet is sentient, and sought to mate with him. The entity forced the Swamp Thing to mate with her, and afterwards the Swamp Thing swiftly fled across the universe to find a new place to grow a body./nFinally, the Swamp Thing found his way to the planet J586, where all plant life is sentient. With the help of Green Lantern Medphyll, the Swamp Thing learned to shift his frequency, so that he could return to Earth and the Green./nBefore reuniting with Abby at last, the Swamp Thing murdered the men responsible for the assassination attempt./nAfter settling down again with Abby in the swamp, the Swamp Thing traveled to the Parliament of Trees, but is greeted with surprised horror. The Parliament had assumed him dead, and had therefore begun to grow a sprout which would grow into a new elemental, once bound with a human spirit. The upshot of which being that having two elementals active at one time would set the balance of nature awry and cause calamity. The Parliament gave him the choice to either take root in the Parliament, and leave Abby forever, or to kill the Sprout. The Swamp Thing refused to do either, whatever the consequences./nEventually, the Swamp Thing and Constantine concocted a plan by which they would bind the Sprout to a human host so that he could retire to be with Abby until it is time for him to join the Parliament./nThe Sprout attempted to bind with Solomon Grundy in Slaughter Swamp, but the monster resisted, eventually bathing in toxic chemicals to force the Sprout out. During his encounter with Grundy, the Swamp Thing realized that the Parliament is trying to kill him to restore balance, given that he would not kill the Sprout./nHe returned to the Parliament, and demanded to speak with a committee, to find a solution for the Sprout problem. In communing with the members, he discovered that across time, there have been hundreds of elementals, all of whom were once humans that were killed by fire. The meeting is a trap and as he experienced pasts of the committee members, he began to take root./nAt the same time, the Sprout attempted to bind with an insane, evil man named Alan Bolland who had just died in the midst of a terrorist attack. The Parliament sensed the evil within Bolland, and it shocked the Swamp Thing out of his hypnosis. He used his frequency shifting abilities to force the committee members out into space, and the resulting chaos forced the Sprout from Bolland's body./nConstantine's contacts seemed to indicate that the Parliament's predictions were right: something is wrong with the balance of nature. Using his contacts, he arranged to find out where and when the next candidate for binding with the Sprout would be ready. Constantine arranged to help reconcile an average man named Gary Holland with the idea of becoming the next Swamp Thing, as his plane is destined to crash with no survivors. Meanwhile, the Swamp Thing had hidden the Sprout on the Moon. Upon his return through the Green, he encountered the lost souls of those on the crashed plane, and guided them all to Heaven - including his intended replacement. There would have to be another plan./nThe pair went through several other failed attempts, going so far as to try to bond the Sprout with the Swamp Thing's friend Chester Williams.[a] Fortunately, that is not required. The Swamp Thing decided, at Abby's urging, to grow himself a more powerful brain to solve the dilemma. After one and a half months of deliberation, he managed to find a solution./nThe Swamp Thing used his abilities to take control of a somewhat unwilling Constantine's body, displacing Constantine into the astral plane. Then, in that human form, the Swamp Thing and Abby finally consummated their relationship, conceiving a child for the sprout to bond to. In the body of a child, the Sprout would be given the chance to learn at a slower rate./nDespite seemingly having found happiness with his wife, the Swamp Thing is soon set upon by the Dominators. Given that their weaponry is of a plant-based nature, they knew they had to eliminate the one being on Earth who could easily render them toothless in their intended invasion. To dispose of him, the Dominators used a device to displace the Swamp Thing in time./nThe Swamp Thing found himself within the body of a soldier during the Second World War in 1945. There, he encountered a young Anton Arcane, using an abattoir as his lab for the creation of his Un-Men. Arcane used an artifact known as the Claw of Aelkh\u00fcnd to send the Swamp Thing further back in time./nThe Swamp Thing is then occupying the body of a downed French pilot during the First World War. There, he met Abby's grandmother Ana\u00efs Arcane, who called on her young doctor son, Anton, to treat his wounds. Naturally, Anton's interest in the Swamp Thing's biology is less than medical, and the result of their encounter faced the Swamp Thing with the Claw again, sending him further back./nHe next awakes in the Old West in 1872, where he is trapped within a large chunk of amber. Eventually, a team of heroes, including Bat-Lash and Hawk Haukins, managed to free him. Hopefully, the Swamp Thing arranged to have his photo taken with them, thinking that his pregnant wife might see him, and know he is okay. Knowing he had to go back further, he willingly faced the Claw again./nThe Swamp Thing became trapped again in a piece of amber, falling into the hands of Tomahawk, the Old West hero. Another exposure to the Claw sent him back to medieval times when he encountered Merlin, the Shining Knight, and an item believed to be the Holy Grail./nFurther back, the Swamp Thing encountered a tribe of early men, who lived in harmony with the Green, but they were killed by a younger, more violent race of men in the Ice Age. Before dying, a shaman that the Swamp Thing befriended gave to him three seeds, and stored the spirits of his people away within a piece of amber - which sent the Swamp Thing back further still./nThe Swamp Thing arrived at a time when man had not yet been born. He encountered three of his predecessors; Yggdrasil (the tree of life), Tuuru (the tree of knowledge), and Eyam. They explained that they were the three founders of the Parliament of Trees, and sent him back once more into the past./nIn a world desolate and devoid of life, the Swamp Thing grew his brain large once more, and realized that it is he who created the Parliament, and began the succession of Earth elementals. He planted one of the three seeds he is given, which later grew into Yggdrasil, imbuing it with a map of all his knowledge. Then, he allowed a flow of lava to overtake him, converting the sap within his enlarged brain to amber./nFinally, the Swamp Thing realized that the reason that he is sent back in time by the Claw is that the chunk of amber within it is a future version of himself. He waited millennia for the day when John Constantine would find his way to the present day location of the Claw, and release him./nFinally freed, the Swamp Thing arrives home just in time to witness the birth of his daughter, Tef\u00e9 Holland./nThe Swamp Thing is unaware when he chose Constantine as the surrogate for the conception of his daughter that he had received a blood transfusion from the demon Nergal. Likewise, he is unprepared for the fact that the powers of his daughter extend to both the Green and the Red. One day, when she witnesses him disappearing into the Green, she tries to do the same, and in the process, destroys her human body./nTef\u00e9's astral form traveled through the spirit world until it ended up on the outskirts of Hell. There, she caught the attention of the demon Beelzebub, not to mention Anton Arcane who managed to gain lowly demon status by way of his evil ways. Arcane is assigned to Nergal, who recognized his own taint within Tef\u00e9. Through this taint, the demons hoped to gain control of her, although the child became the center of a political struggle in Hell between the Spider Guild, Beelzebub and Azazel./nThe Swamp Thing entered the spirit world, where he encountered a number of alien spirits who were stuck in the human afterlife after the Dominators' attack. Together, they traveled to Hell. There, Etrigan explained the truth about Tef\u00e9's demon taint. Confronting Nergal, it seemed as though the Swamp Thing was no match for him. Later, Arcane's machinations had connected Tef\u00e9 to the irrigation system of the whole city, and when she opened a window back to Earth, it caused the destruction of the city and all the demons within./nThe destruction of Nergal's garden released a particular spirit on Earth. It is Matango, a fungus-based lifeform. Meanwhile, the Swamp Thing and his wife search for a way to get Tef\u00e9 back into a physical body. With Constantine's help, they determine that she must be the one to recreate the body herself, but without any knowledge of anatomy, she would not be able to do so properly./nA shaman clued the Swamp Thing in to the existence of a fountain in the Garden of Eden which can allow any being the ability to understand all languages. With this, Tef\u00e9 could understand how to rebuild her own body with instruction. The Swamp Thing met with the Parliament of Trees to find out the location of the fountain. There, he reunited with Yggdrasil, Eyam, and Tuuru, who explained that much of what he had been taught in the past is a ruse to bring about the birth of a plant-human hybrid: Tef\u00e9./nYggdrasil explains that by planting the first of the three seeds, the Swamp Thing brought about the birth of the Parliament. The second became his vessel forward through time. The third is consumed by Tef\u00e9 - and that is what awakened Matango. The seed represented the ways of the old race of man, who were in communion with nature. The newer, more violent race of men served Matango's needs better./nThe Parliament had once resided in the Garden of Eden, but a war with Matango and the fungus-based life force known as the Gray forced them out. The fountain is still to be found in the ruins of Eden, which lies in what became known as Antarctica. The Swamp Thing traveled there, rescuing Eyam's trapped soul, collecting a frozen shard of the waters of the fountain, and narrowly escaping destruction by the angels who protected the ruins./nAs a hurricane threatened all of Louisiana the Swamp Thing returned, giving Tefe the water from the fountain. With the help of Constantine's friend Brenda and the shaman of Sarga, Tef\u00e9 is able to rebuild most of her body, but Matango had assembled an army of servants of the Gray to capture the infant. The new body she grew became corrupted with mold and fungus, prompting the Swamp Thing to destroy it, as the hurricane swept over the swamp, and destroyed everything in sight./nThe next morning, the Swamp Thing and his family decided to take Tef\u00e9 to the Parliament of Trees for her protection./nUpon their arrival at the Parliament of Trees, Yggdrasil helped recreate Tef\u00e9's body for them. The Parliament then explained to the Swamp Thing that Matango was once the 13th in the line of plant elementals, and the last to share in the secret knowledge of the Parliament's creation via a time loop. When Matango was protector of the Green, a meteor formed by the destruction of a planet that is home to the Gray landed on Earth. Matango volunteered to host the new lifeform to learn more about it. His own ambition was corrupted by the Gray's drive to consume, and he became its agent./nA war broke out between the Green and the Gray, which forced the elementals to leave Eden. To have a compromise, the Parliament caused an Ice Age that allowed the new race of man to conquer the old race, so that in time, if man caused the downfall of the Green, the Gray could take its place. By giving a seed of the old race to his daughter, the Swamp Thing caused the balance to be offset. The Parliament decided that to save the Green, they needed to confront Matango./nThe Swamp Thing began to amass an army of those elementals trapped by the Gray during the war. Matango anticipated this, and all of the efforts were in vain, leading to the Swamp Thing's capture and imprisonment, deep in the Pacific Ocean. The Swamp Thing risked the death of all those imprisoned by attempting to form a body there, but is successful, with the help of others./nThey return to the Parliament, where they learned that Matango had ensnared Abby and Tef\u00e9. Climbing the rotting trunk of Yggdrasil, he reaches them and set them free before heading onward to Matango's lair. Discovering that Matango's weakness is his old Green form, the Swamp Thing used his own skin against him, and severed his connection to the Gray./nThe Gray finds a new, more neutral vessel, who promises that he will wait until the Green's time has passed before allowing the Gray to inherit Earth./nAfter a time of being able to live happily with his family, the Swamp Thing becomes aware of the resurgence of the Sunderland Corporation as a threat to the environment. Now run by General Sunderland's daughter Constance, the Sunderland Corporation took on a personal vendetta against the Swamp Thing while pursuing its greedy, destructive interests./nMeanwhile, Tef\u00e9's power over both plants and flesh became a matter of concern for her parents when she showed a tendency to horribly mangle and kill those who angered her. When she killed the family cat in anger, it is decided that the Swamp Thing would consult the Parliament of Trees for help. The Parliament sent Lady Jane to act as Tef\u00e9's governess, allowing the Swamp Thing to focus his attention on protecting the Green./nEventually, in Hell, Lucifer abdicated his rule, allowing many of the demons trapped there to escape - including Anton Arcane. Arcane returned to the land of the living with intent to possess Tef\u00e9's body, and cause pain to his niece Abigail. Arcane's attempted coup is thwarted by the appearance of Agony and Ecstacy, but he vowed to return./nWhen Constance Sunderland had an occultist named Doctor Polygon resurrect her father from death, it provided Anton Arcane with a body to host his spirit. Using Sunderland's influence and his own power, Arcane managed to terrorize his niece once again./nWith the threat of Anton Arcane's return, Abigail makes the Swamp Thing promise to stay with her and their daughter to protect them and be a husband and father. Reluctantly, he agrees - but the Parliament of Trees is displeased with the decision. When a great threat to the environment and the Green appeared, the Swamp Thing is forced to choose between breaking his promise to Abby or allowing the Green to suffer. Ultimately, he chose neither, and created a double of himself to look after his family while he protected the Green. He had intended to return to his family once the threat was taken care of, but the Parliament prevented it - leaving his double to become firmly entrenched as the family man he could not be./nAfter being away for two weeks, the Swamp Thing's body is restored, but with an altered appearance. The toxins gone, he returns to Louisiana to reunite with his family, but the double that he created believes that he is more worthy to be with Abby and Tef\u00e9 than the Swamp Thing, and they fought. When the Swamp Thing realizes that the double is not merely a copy, but a part of him, the Swamp Thing absorbs it back into his body. Abby is disgusted when she realized his deceit, and decides to leave him and move to New Orleans with Chester Williams./nThe Swamp Thing is among the heroes who attend a memorial service for Green Lantern Hal Jordan. As a tribute to Hal and the destroyed Coast City, the Swamp Thing turns the barren city into a lush garden./nAlec Holland returns to life by the Entity within the White Lantern, while the Swamp Thing has become a being of mindless destruction. Alec's last conscious memory was of hurling himself into the swamp to extinguish the flames engulfing him, having no memory of ever being the Swamp Thing previously. Constantine took it upon himself to seek the living Alec out, and force him to reunite with the Swamp Thing as one, returning its conscience. However, since he had been given his life back, Alec wanted to keep it, and John conceded, letting him live./nThe Entity reveals Alec Holland as its champion and a missing, vital component of the Swamp Thing itself. Unlike the previous incarnation, a mass of humanoid plant life with all of Holland's absorbed memories, this new, renewed Swamp Thing was generated directly from the body of Alec Holland himself. The Entity imbued upon Holland all of the powers of the Green that the former had wielded, including the additional elemental governance over fire. As the Swamp Thing, Alec grew to an enormous height to battle the corrupted being. Upon defeating it, he restored the Green to its natural order./nIn DC Comics's company-wide reboot The New 52, Alec Holland is brought back to life, but is haunted by the memories of the Swamp Thing. Alec tries to put those memories behind him and live life as a carpenter in Louisiana, yet the Green continues to reach out for him. He is visited at work by Superman, who informs him of strange animal deaths across the world. Alec declines further investigating the matter as he explains to Superman his search for a normal life. He tells Superman how he tried returning to his botany work and successfully created a bio-restorative formula, but he also had a vision of a world covered in Green so he destroyed it. Later that night, Alec has nightmares of the Swamp Thing and awakes to find his room covered in plants. He runs outside, this time to truly destroy the formula which he kept, only to be stopped by the Swamp Thing./nThe Swamp Thing reveals himself to be Calbraith A. H. Rodgers, a World War II pilot who was shot down but transformed by the Green into the Swamp Thing. Alec is reluctant to hear his message but allows him to speak. Rodgers tells Alec of the rise of Sethe and the Rot and Alec's importance as the next protector of the Green. Rodgers also confirms that the Swamp Thing of Alec's memories was not him and that Alec is destined to be the greatest protector of the Green, a warrior king. He dies to deliver this message to Alec and with his dying words warns Alec to stay away from the white-haired woman. Alec returns to his motel when the entire staff and guests have been turned into minions of the Rot. Alec is almost taken when he is saved by a woman on a motorcycle. She drives them off and pulls over revealing herself to be the woman with white hair, Abigail Arcane./nAbigail pulls over and demands that Alec \"do something\". She believes him to be the Swamp Thing and puts a gun to his head to make him prove it. Alec reacts as vines and roots apprehend Abby. He releases her and explains that he has the creature's memories but that he is not the Swamp Thing. Abby asks for his help in finding her half-brother, William Arcane, at a hospital in Texas. On the way Abby explains that the Rot calls to her the same way the Green calls for Alec, but when she is near it is weaker. They pull over to rest and Alec drifts of and goes into the Green. They warn him that the Rot is coming, that it will take over his world and that they have fought this war for millions of years and it is now Alec's turn to be the Swamp Thing. Alec claims they are close to stopping William Arcane but the Parliament insists it is Abigail who is the real threat and that he should kill her now. Alec wakes up to find Abby leaving and stops her. He argues to stay close to her and protect her and they continue towards William, who has taken over a slaughterhouse in Stocks, TX. While stocking up at a gun shop they are attacked by William and his reanimated monsters. Alec attacks with sharp vines and roots and impales or tears apart each of the monsters and restrains William in a tree. He rushes to Abby's aide and kisses her. William begins to celebrate and claims that they are doomed./nAlec immediately feels something wrong within the Green and feels them crying out in fear. Abby is covered in the Rot as it forms a cocoon around her. She begs him to run away and leave her as he does so, reluctantly. Alec is chased by flying creatures from the Rot and fends them off with a shotgun. He pulls over at the nearest swamp and calls for the Green to take him. They say it is too late and all is lost as Alec is impaled from behind with a chainsaw by a member of the Rot. As Alec lay dying, he begs for the Green to save him. The Green answers his call but only prolongs his death to extend his suffering. Even facing a horrible death, Alec continues to defend Abby to the Parliament of Trees. Alec claims that she will be able to refuse the Rot's call just as he was able to resist theirs. He states that it is human restraint that is coveted by the Parliament as they had lost that capacity long ago. Alec sees the Green as being no less violent and wild as the Red and the Rot. He asks that the Parliament use their last bit of power to get the bio-restorative formula from his bag and turn him into the Swamp Thing. Alec assures them he is only doing this to save Abby, though he knows he will once again be forever changed into the monster. The Parliament agrees to his plan, and breaks open the bio-restorative formula. Alec's human body is destroyed, and replaced with plant matter, as he emerges from the pod as the Swamp Thing, impaling all of his attackers with sharp vines and roots before growing wings and flying towards the Rot, declaring war./nAlec, as the new and improved Swamp Thing, flies into the Rot kingdom and confronts Sethe. Alec tells Sethe to release Abigail and he will \"spare him some pain\". Sethe laughs and sends his army of the undead after Alec. Alec manages to fight his way through walking corpses towards Sethe, but stops to see Abby crawl out of her cocoon in her new form. Alec tries to calm Abby down in her monstrous new form, but it does not work; Abby now only has one thought on her mind: \"Alec needs to die\"./nAbby impales Alec as Seethe's army cheers on. Alec begs her to stop, but she is unable to control herself. Alec turns and commands Abby to stop and begins to reverse her transformation by using vanilla grown from orchid seeds he placed in peaches they shared earlier. He changes Abby back as Seethe unleashes on him. Abby stands and destroys Seethe and takes Alec away to treat his wounds. She takes Alec to a swamp where he has pulled the essence of the Parliament and started new trees. Alec and Abby share a kiss before he returns to sleep and heal in the swamp. Just then Arcane and his Un-Men ambushed them to take Abby. The Parliament rescued the injured Alec to fend off Arcane and his cohorts. Animal Man and his team then visited just in time to seek help for his son who was injured by one of the Rot's Hunters Three./nThe Swamp Thing and Animal Man are tricked into entering the Rot in hopes to stop Arcane. Arcane had set a trap for them for as soon as they enter the Rot; a full year progresses in the world without their presence. This became known as the Rotworld. Arcane reveals his plan to Alec and Buddy and separates them in the Rotworld. Alec is found by Poison Ivy and Deadman who take him to the Parliament of Trees, the last living place in the world. Together they fight off an army of Rotlings led by the Rotworld's Teen Titans. The Swamp Thing grows himself into an immense size and crushes the Titans. Deadman and Alec head to Gotham City in search of a weapon to defeat the Rot. The Swamp Thing constructs a boat out of vegetation and sails to Gotham. They are attacked by William Arcane, armed with Aquaman's trident. He attacks them with Starro the Conqueror under his control. The Swamp Thing and Deadman are swallowed alive by Starro until Alec cuts him open from inside. Deadman sacrifices himself by taking control of William, which kills them both. Alec arrives in Gotham City, only to find the Batman already taken over by the Rot. He is being held by Barbara Gordon who has kept herself alive using the Man-Bat serum./nBarbara leads Alec to Arkham Asylum which is protected by a green dome powered by Mr. Freeze, Killer Croc and the Floronic Man. The Batman left Alec a sample of the bio-restorative formula along with a weaponized mech to deliver it. They managed to break an all out siege by Rotlings and Rotworld's Giganta and Gordon. Using Banes' Venom delivering equipment with the formula to keep him empowered, Alec led an army of Gothamites equipped with formula dipped bullets with Barbara to take down Arcane at his stronghold. Battling against Rot army led by Rotworld's Wonder Woman and Flash, they met up with Frankenstein and Animal Man's army who were fighting off Rotworld's Superman./nConstantine forcefully summoned the Swamp Thing to help him retrieve the stolen House of Mystery. He was refusal about it unless Frankenstein vouched for John. While tracking the house the perpetrator, Doctor Destiny attacked with magic just in time and separated the Justice League Dark team to different locations individually to deal with their own nightmares.[2] The Swamp Thing was abducted to tap into his energy to empower Destiny's magic to unleash personal nightmares unto people using the house. The villain briefly attacked the Swamp Thing for being defiant.[3] With the Flash's aid, the team arrived and Deadman managed to free the Swamp Thing by very briefly possessing him which helped defeat Destiny.[4]/nDuring the event Forever Evil: Blight, with only Constantine left, Nightmare Nurse tried helping by growing a duplicate Swamp Thing from a piece of him. He reprimanded them by bursting out of the duplicate, regrowing himself and attacked them. Constantine had the house dispersed the attack. The Swamp Thing then offered his help since the arrival of the Crime Syndicate brought over dark energies that disrupted Earth. They failed in tracking down the other heroes by pooling their energies into the ritual and in recruiting Blight in the psychic realm as aid.[5] After such events of Trinity War and Forever Evil only Deadman, Zatanna and Nightmare Nurse were left on the team. Zatanna forcefully summoned the Swamp Thing to recruit him, just then Nightmare Nurse was magically attacked and regressed back to Alicia Winter.[6]/nThe Swamp Thing was investigating one of the villages that disappeared into the ground which disturbed the Green when Wonder Woman mistook him as the perpetrator and fought him, accusing him of losing touch with his humanity. The Swamp Thing had to restrain her with vines and explained his innocence just as Aquaman arrived. He informed them he would defer any leads he found to Aquaman.[7]/nSuperman was investigating a sudden drought when the Swamp Thing showed up and demanded Superman didn't belong here as his way of absorbing Sun energy was disturbing The Green.[8]/nThe Swamp Thing returns to Gotham City at a murder scene where the Batman and Commissioner Gordon are present. He reveals to them that the man murdered was his father, Lloyd McGinn. Showing no sadness to the death of his father, he reveals to the Batman that he only met him once after he was transformed, and the reason he came was because he wanted to know why he came. The two team up to uncover the assassin, and soon find out that it was a serial killer known as the Headhunter./nBatman and the Swamp Thing encounter the Headhunter in an art gallery. He tells them that he met McGinn at a bar, singing a lullaby. He asked him what the song was about, to which McGinn responded it was about \"life\". McGinn asked if the Headhunter knew about life, and he responded negatively, saying that he maybe \"knew something about death\". McGinn said that life and death were the same thing. After the Headhunter asked what he meant by that, he said he did not know, but that was what his son, the Swamp Thing, told him. Envious because the man was related to a superhero and got \"all the answers\" that normal people could not get, the Headhunter discovered where he lived and killed him./nInfuriated, the Swamp Thing kills the Headhunter immediately, singing the same lullaby his father did. He reveals to the Batman that his father used to sing the song when he was scared as a child. The Batman gets angry, claiming he was used by the Swamp Thing. The Swamp Thing turns sad because of the distant relationship with his father, and says that the Batman does not understand. The Batman is offended by the statement that he does not understand. The Swamp Thing tells him that he believed the Batman was the reason he came, and because he knew that, he had no reason to stay. The Swamp Thing then disappears, leaving the Batman alone.[9]/nThe Swamp Thing recruited Cave Carson's team to investigate an unusual floating building belonging to Retconn that was killing the surrounding ecosystem and had unconscious people trapped inside calling for help subconsciously. Carson suggested infiltration via surrendering themselves willingly, hiding his cybernetic eye and have the Swamp Thing bidding time in his stomach. Carson's team were then brainwashed to become Retconn's employee by regularly drinking their milk. The Swamp Thing started causing Carson's stomach upset to undo the mind control and just as Carson's cybernetic eye revealed itself, he forced Carson to forcefully consume many vegetables to regrow himself out, at first by getting puked out as a bunch of vines to kill all other fake milk based employees in the cafeteria, then forming vegetables dummies to reenact the team's initial infiltration planning, finally reforming killing the remaining milk human and purging the brainwashing milk from the team's bodies, reminding them again of their plan./nThe Swamp Thing stayed behind to fend off the attacking employees and rescue Jack, leaving Chloe with a glowing yellow rose to track their positions. He fell from the top floors just in time to save the duo and was being attacked by mask brainwashed Jack and his new team of Wild Dog. They fought off the team and undone Jack's brainwashing, the Swamp Thing used vines to help compress Jack's wound and the team went off to Human Resources department to rescue the trapped people, lamenting the tortured victims' situation. The Swamp Thing was overwhelmed by the psychic cries and has the team joined him in the psychic plane by burning and inhaling a psychedelic plant he grew to shut the system down. Retconn was using artists and writers to retcon reality into much more conservative, family friendly to be sold off as an estate./nWhile they were under siege, Jack suggested having the Swamp Thing to grind the dead victims' bodies to make fertilizer bomb which Chloe found wildly inappropriate. The Swamp Thing did it growing a big wood trunk compost bin and Jack blew their way out of the building. Carson opted to stay behind to ensure complete destruction of the building just as the Swamp Thing flew the other two off to safety wishing Carson good luck to which he replied no need.[10]/nA memory of Alec manifested to calm the new Swamp Thing who was anguished with losing his friend when they were unknowingly transported into the Green and having a rough time dealing with Poison Ivy.[11] He managed to persuade the new Swamp Thing to accept his role and prioritize ridding the Contagion from The Green.[12]/nAlec Holland appears in The Batman Adventures #16. This version lives with the long-retired Pamela Isley and encounters a plant doppelganger she had created prior to keep Batman from locating her.[27]", "43434668": "Karl Bartholomaeus[1] Heller  (20 November 1824 \u2013 14 December 1880) was an Austrian botanist and naturalist who explored Mexico in 1845\u201348 and published his memoir.[2] In the latter year Johann Jakob Heckel published the livebearing freshwater Green swordtail (Xiphophorus helleri), since the early 20th century a common aquarium fish, from specimens Heller deposited in Vienna.

Both of these visits led to long-term collaborations.[2][3][4]/nHofmeyr's doctoral research concerned the use of graphical patterns to elucidate chains of interaction in metabolic regulation, later published in the European Journal of Biochemistry,[5] and his collaboration with Kacser led to a study of the effect of moiety-conservation on control of pathways.[6] At this time he and Cornish-Bowden were concerned that the development of metabolic control analysis seemed to be almost independent of the knowledge of metabolic regulation that had grown from the recognition of regulatory mechanisms in the 1950s and 1960s, most notably the importance of feedback inhibition[7][8][9][10] and cooperative behaviour of enzymes.[11] This led them to propose a way of quantifying metabolic regulation,[12] the first of a series of publications that culminated in an analysis of the role of supply and demand in biochemical systems, i.e. an analysis of how negative feedback allow metabolic pathways to respond to changes in the demand for metabolites while resisting variations in the supply of starting materials.[13]/nDuring the 21st century Hofmeyr has applied ideas of control analysis to ecosystems,[14] and to the understanding of the self-organization of cell function in the spirit of Robert Rosen.[15] More recently he has worked on the development of code biology, the novel discipline founded by Marcello Barbieri that recognizes that the genetic code is just one of several codes used and needed by biological systems.[16]/nAppointed as Junior Lecturer in the Biochemistry Department of the University of Stellenbosch in 1975, Hofmeyr eventually became Distinguished Professor in 2014, and Emeritus Professor in 2019. Between 2009 and 2015 he was Co-director and then Director of the Centre for Studies in Complexity at Stellenbosch, which he had co-founded in 2009.[3][17]/nIn addition to his scientific research, Hofmeyr is a classically trained flute player\nand also plays the baroque flute, guitar and banjo.\nHe was one of the composers and performers who helped launch the Afrikaans \"Kabaret\"\ntradition in the 1980s in South Africa, through his work with authors, composers and directors.\nHis classic scores for lyrics of Hennie Aucamp and Etienne van Heerden have become standard items in Afrikaans popular\nmusic.

Bada (born September 10, 1942)[1] is an American chemist known for his works in the study of the origin of life. He is distinguished research professor of marine chemistry and former director of the NASA Specialized Center of Research and Training (NSCORT) in Exobiology at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego. Bada has played a pioneering role in the development of the Mars Organic Detector (MOD) instrument package that is designed to search for amino acids and other organic compounds directly on the surface of Mars during future ESA and NASA missions.[2]/nBada studied at the San Diego State University and obtained BS in chemistry in 1965. He wanted to become a theoretical chemist, applying quantum mechanics to chemistry and had no prior interest in prebiotic chemistry. Then he met Stanley Miller at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) who inspired him to take up the spark discharge experiment a step forward by studying amino acid stability. Bada completed PhD in chemistry in 1968 under Miller's supervision.[3] He worked as research fellow at the Hoffman Labs of the department of geological science at Harvard University for one year.[1] In 1968 he joined the UCSD department of chemistry as instructor, and became assistant professor of marine chemistry in 1969. He became associate professor in 1974 and full professor in 1980. Between 1980 and 2009 he was director of NASA Specialized Center of Research and Training (NSCORT) in Exobiology. In 2009 he was promoted to distinguished professor, and in 2010 to distinguished research professor. He has more than 200 technical publications.[2]/nAs a marine geochemist, Bada made significant research in geochronology. During the 1970s and 1980s he developed an important technique of marine sediment dating through the measurement of the racemisation rates of amino acids. This method is useful for dating a large span in geological time scale. This is useful in marine biology, palaeontology and archaeology for dating millions of years old organic materials based on their amino acid content.[1][4]/nBada is a leading scientist in the study of organic compounds outside of the Earth. Among his works was the analysis of the Martian meteorite Nakhla, which fell in Egypt in 1911. His team found aspartic acid, glutamic acids, glycine, alanine, beta-alanine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid as the most abundant amino acids in the meteorite.[5] This a supports the notion that the organic building blocks of life could be naturally synthesized and were present in the making of the solar system. He and his team also developed a Mars Organic Analyzer (MOA), which is a microfabricated capillary electrophoresis (CE) instrument for sensitive amino acid biomarker analysis.[6] The device is useful in planetary exploration such as for the analysis of even trace amounts of amino acids, mono- and diaminoalkanes, amino sugars, nucleobases, and nucleobase degradation products from living and non-living materials.[7]/nJeffrey Bada is best known for his research on the origin of life, following his mentor Miller, whose laboratory he inherited. In fact his most famous works, perhaps, are his reassessment and validation of the original Miller's experiments.[8][9] In 1999, Miller had a stroke and on thinking of his medical condition, he donated everything in his office to Bada's laboratory.[3] Just before Miller's death in 2007, several cardboard boxes containing vials of dried residues were found in his laboratory at UCSD. The labels indicated that some were from Miller's original 1952\u20131954 experiments, produced by using three different apparatuses, and one from 1958, which included H2S in the gaseous mixture for the first time and the result never published. In 2008 Bada and his team reported a re-analysis of the 1952 samples using more sensitive techniques, such as high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography\u2013time of flight mass spectrometry. Their result showed the synthesis of 22 amino acids and 5 amines, revealing that the original Miller experiment produced many more compounds than previously believed.[10] Miller's report of 1953 mentioned synthesis of only glycine, \u03b1- and \u03b2-alanine, with uncertain aspartic acid and GABA.[11] In addition Bada also analysed the unreported 1958 samples in 2011, from which 23 amino acids and 4 amines, including 7 organosulfur compounds, were detected.[12][13][14][15]", "58835658": "C.

She is also the founder and director of the Nucleic Acid Database, and led the Protein Structure Initiative Structural Genomics Knowledgebase.[1][2][3]/nBerman was born in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. Her father, David Bernstein, was a physician and her mother, Dorothy Bernstein (n\u00e9e Skupsky), managed her father's office practice. Inspired by her hard-working and scholarly father, she was interested in science as a young girl and planned to become a scientist or doctor. Her mother, who was strongly involved in the community and volunteer work, influenced her to be involved in community activities throughout her life./nDuring high school, Berman worked in Ingrith Deyrup's laboratory at Barnard College. Deyrup encouraged Berman to attend Barnard as an undergraduate. While at college, she worked in a Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons laboratory with Barbara Low. There, Berman learned about crystallography, which would become a lifelong passion. She graduated from Barnard with an A.B. in chemistry in 1964./nFollowing college, Berman attended the University of Pittsburgh for graduate school, a place she selected because it was the only place in the country with a crystallography department, and one of the few where crystallography was offered as a subject. There she worked with George A. Jeffrey on carbohydrate structure, receiving her Ph.D. in 1967. Berman remained at the University of Pittsburgh for two more years as a postdoctoral research fellow./nIn 1969, Berman moved to the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, where she worked in Jenny P. Glusker's laboratory before starting her own independent research program as a faculty member in 1973. At Fox Chase, Berman became interested in nucleic acid structures and in bioinformatics. She knew that logical organization of data would make it useful to a variety of scientists./nIn June 1971, Berman attended a symposium at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where several scientists agreed that data on the expanding number of protein structures should be archived in a database.[4] That meeting led to the creation of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) at Brookhaven National Laboratory.[5][6]/nIn 1989, Berman moved to Rutgers and in 1992, along with other scientists, she co-founded the Nucleic Acid Database (NDB) to collect and disseminate information about nucleic acid structure.[7] At Rutgers, she continued to study nucleic acids, their interactions with proteins,[8] and also researched the structure of collagen in collaboration with Barbara Brodsky and Jordi Bella.[9] She is listed as a depositor on 38 structures in the PDB from 1992 to 2011, of protein/nucleic acid complexes and their components (e.g. 1RUN, 3SSX, 2B1B), collagen fragments (e.g. 1CGD, 1EI8), and other macromolecules./nIn 1998, Berman and Philip Bourne together competed for and won the contract for the Protein Data Bank and the database moved from Brookhaven to the auspices of the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB), currently a collaboration between Rutgers and the University of California, San Diego. With colleagues, Berman redesigned the data management system, added new user tools, and made the database searchable.[10] Since 2003, the PDB archive has been managed by the worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB), a partnership founded by Berman that consists of organizations that act as deposition, data processing and distribution centers for PDB data \u2013 the RCSB, the PDBe in Europe, and the PDBj in Japan.[11] In 2006 the BioMagResData (BMRB) databank for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) structures[12] became the fourth member of the wwPDB.[13] As of July, 2018, the NDB holds over 9600 nucleic acid structures and the PDB holds more than 142,000 macromolecular structures./nAlso led by the RCSB, the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) Structural Genomics Knowledgebase was launched in the Spring of 2008 to provide a continuously updated portal to research data and other resources from the PSI efforts.[14]/nBerman has also been active in the scientific community, serving as president of the American Crystallographic Association in 1988, advising both the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, and serving on the editorial board of several journals.

Hockfield succeeded Charles M. Vest and was succeeded by L. Rafael Reif, who had served in her administration as Provost. Hockfield was the first biologist and the first woman to serve as the Institute's president.[1] Hockfield currently serves as a Professor of Neuroscience in MIT's Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, a Joint Professor of Work and Organization Studies in MIT\u2019s Sloan School of Management, and a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. She is also a director of Break Through Cancer, Cajal Neuroscience, Fidelity Non-Profit Management Foundation, Lasker Foundation, Mass General Brigham, Pfizer, Repertoire Immune Medicines, and the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research; a lifetime member of the MIT Corporation; and a board member of the Belfer Center at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. Before returning to MIT following her presidency, Hockfield held the Marie Curie Visiting Professorship at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government./nHockfield graduated from Horace Greeley High School in Chappaqua, New York, in 1969. She received her bachelor's degree in Biology from the University of Rochester in 1973 and her Ph.D. in Anatomy and Neuroscience from the Georgetown University School of Medicine in 1979. Her doctoral dissertation centered on the pathways in the nervous system through which pain is perceived and processed. Her advisor during her doctoral work was Stephen Gobel.[2]/nFollowing a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco, Hockfield joined the staff of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1980. She was hired by James Watson, who together with Francis Crick had discovered the structure of DNA./nIn 1985, Hockfield joined the faculty of Yale University. She received tenure in 1991 and became a full professor of neurobiology in 1994; soon thereafter she began to take on positions of administrative leadership. From 1998 to 2002, she served as Dean of Yale's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, with oversight of 70 graduate programs. Over the course of her deanship, the number of applicants to the graduate school doubled. Support for graduate students also expanded in many dimensions, including healthcare, career counseling, fellowships, and opportunities to interact with faculty./nIn December 2002, she was named Yale's Provost \u2014 the university's second-highest officer, with oversight of the university's 12 schools. As Provost, she led major initiatives in science, medicine, and engineering, including a $500 million investment in scientific facilities./nDuring her time as dean and as provost, Hockfield was at the center of an imbroglio surrounding the Graduate Employees and Students Organization and its unionization efforts. While Yale opposed the student union, Hockfield made healthcare for Ph.D. students free and increased stipends for graduate students.[3]/nIn August 2004, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology named Hockfield its next president. MIT raised nearly $3 billion during Hockfield's presidency, making it a more successful period of fundraising than any prior administration. However, the global financial crisis put great pressure on the Institute's endowment, which was valued at $5.9 billion upon Hockfield's arrival. It peaked at $9.9 billion in June 2008, then fell to $7.9 billion. By June 2011, it was valued at $9.7 billion. Through these financial ups and downs, Hockfield made affordability a priority: Annual undergraduate financial aid increased by about 75 percent during her presidency.[4]/nIn her inaugural address, Hockfield called for MIT to cultivate the convergence of engineering and the life sciences to develop new approaches to address global challenges.[5] She encouraged work that crossed disciplines, departments, and schools within MIT and that fostered collaborations among the Boston region's academic medical centers and educational institutions. To that end, she led, among other efforts, the establishment of the David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research; the Ragon Institute (a collaboration between Massachusetts General Hospital, MIT, and Harvard University); and the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center in Holyoke, Massachusetts, an unprecedented collaboration of 5 universities, 2 private companies, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to provide state-of-the art computation tools for research in a wide variety of fields.[4]/nHockfield also announced her intention to develop a multidisciplinary, Institute-wide center focused on energy. That effort spawned the MIT Energy Initiative, which raised more than $350 million during Hockfield's tenure and accelerated research on technologies and policies for a sustainable energy future. In 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama gave an address on U.S. energy policy at MIT, and Hockfield gave him the first tour of an MIT laboratory by a sitting U.S. president.[6]/nHockfield also encouraged concerted faculty research in an area she considered vital to American national interests: manufacturing. She launched \u201cProduction in the Innovation Economy,\u201d a campus-wide project to provide a blueprint for 21st century manufacturing in America. During her presidency, she served as the inaugural co-chair of the White House-led Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP), a task force of government, industry, and academic leaders. In an August 2011 New York Times op-ed, Hockfield wrote, \u201cTo make our economy grow, sell more goods to the world and replenish the work force, we need to restore manufacturing \u2014 not the assembly-line jobs of the past, but the high-tech advanced manufacturing of the future.\u201d[7]/nDuring Hockfield's presidency, representation of underrepresented minorities and women increased across the undergraduate, graduate, and faculty populations. The graduating Class of 2015 was composed of 45 percent women and 24 percent underrepresented minorities. To address the growing interest in attending MIT (applications more than doubled during her tenure), Hockfield initiated an expansion of the undergraduate population. She also guided enhancements to student life and learning, including the construction of a new residence for graduate students and a restoration of MIT's oldest building into an undergraduate residence with expanded space and amenities to foster student collaboration./nIn addition, while Hockfield was president, the east side of MIT's campus was enhanced by an extension to the Media Lab complex and a new building for the MIT Sloan School of Management. Hockfield also led a comprehensive strategic planning process for campus development and worked to foster the innovation cluster around Kendall Square, which at the end of her presidency was home to more biotech and life sciences companies per square mile than anywhere in the world.[4]/nIn December 2011, MIT launched MITx, a not-for-profit online learning platform that offers online versions of MIT courses free of charge. In May 2012, Hockfield and Harvard president Drew Gilpin Faust announced edX, an MIT-Harvard partnership in online education. EdX, Hockfield said, \u201crepresents a unique opportunity to improve education on our own campuses through online learning, while simultaneously creating a bold new educational path for millions of learners worldwide.\u201d[8]/nHockfield pioneered the use of monoclonal antibody technology in brain research and discovered a gene that plays a critical role in the spread of cancer in the brain. Hockfield's early work involved the application of monoclonal antibody technology to questions within neurobiology. She and her colleagues identified a family of cell surface proteins whose expression is regulated by neuronal activity early in an animal's life and which reflect the effect of early experience on brain structure and function. A link between her research and human health was made when it was suggested that one of these proteins played a role in the progression of brain tumors. Hockfield's work on a type of brain tumor called glioma identified molecules that allow glioma cells to move through normal brain tissue, the feature that makes glioma particularly deadly.[9]/nHockfield is married to Thomas N. Byrne, M.D., a Professor of Neurology and Health Sciences Technology (part-time) at the Harvard Medical School and a Senior Lecturer of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT.

This work led to a significant paper being published in the Annual Review of Physiology.[6]/nIn 1975, Gannon moved to the University of Strasbourg, France to take up a post-doctoral fellowship in the laboratory of Professor Pierre Chambon.[4] In 1977, while still in this role, Gannon was appointed Charg\u00e9 de Recherche of the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM).[5] During this time he was involved in a number of DNA cloning experiments which culminated in the isolation of the chicken ovalbumin gene.[7]/nIn 1981 Gannon returned to University College Galway (UCG) in Ireland and took up a position in the Department of Microbiology.[4]/nFrom 1994 to 2007, Gannon was the Executive Director (Secretary at the time) of the European Molecular Biology Organisation (EMBO) and Senior Scientist at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), based in Germany.[8]/nDuring this time, Gannon became the founding editor of the journal EMBO Reports and contributed a monthly editorial on a range of topics, including the impact of research on society.[3] During his time at EMBO, Gannon also showed a commitment to female researchers by analysing fellowship application data to conduct an objective assessment of the potential causes for the lower success rate of female applicants for postdoctoral fellowships.[9]/nDuring this period, Gannon also maintained an active research group that focussed on the manner in which the oestrogen receptor (ER) controlled gene expression. Outstanding from a series of high-impact studies was the demonstration of the cyclical nature of the binding of the ER to its DNA response element that resulted in the sequential recruitment of chromatin-modifying enzymes and ultimately the RNA polymerase, prior to that sequence of events being reversed.[10] Pursuing this research approach, Gannon's team subsequently showed that DNA methylation (previously thought to be an indelible mark) was also subject to dynamic and cyclical change.[11]/nIn 2007, after 13 years at the helm of EMBO, Gannon accepted the position of Director General of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI).[8] SFI had been established by the Irish government 10 years earlier to recruit and retain high-quality researchers based on their excellence, with the expectation that this would provide an extra offering and possibilities for multi-national and local companies that had activities particularly in the areas of pharmaceuticals, information technology and energy.[12]/nSoon after Gannon moved to Dublin for the SFI position, Ireland faced a major economic setback that ultimately required a bailout from the EU and the International Monetary Fund.[13] Faced with the uncertainty of future funding for SFI, Gannon decided to move again, and in 2010, he accepted the position of Director and CEO of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research (QIMR) in Brisbane, Australia.[2] Gannon started at QIMR in January 2011.  The name of the institute was changed to QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute (QIMR Berghofer), following Gannon's successful attraction of a major donation from Clive Berghofer \u2013 a philanthropist and property developer from Toowoomba.[14]/nAt QIMR Berghofer, Gannon restructured the Institute so that it had four programs (Cancer, Infectious Diseases, Mental Health, and Chronic Disorders) and four departments (Genetics and Computational Biology, Immunology, Cell and Molecular Biology, and Population Health.[15] Gannon made a specific effort to extend translation of the institute's research, through industry, to the clinic.[16] He also placed emphasis on developing better contacts with Asia, which resulted in increased research and commercial collaborations, particularly with China and India.[17] He also reactivated his research group focusing on enzymes involved in epigenetic modifications.[18] In 2019, Gannon announced he was retiring after nine years at the helm of the Institute.

It holds workshops and working group meetings with faculty in and outside of ASU, organizes a biannual Cooperation and Conflict Symposium, and the Interdisciplinary Study of Cooperation Winter School taught by world-renowned cooperation researchers. In addition to supporting the interdisciplinary study of cooperation, it also supports broader ventures to cultivate cooperation among the disciplines. Aktipis hosts a series of interactive livestreams joined by cooperation scientists.[6]/nA large focus of Aktipis' work is cooperation in humans, focusing especially on helping behavior that occurs in times of need. Aktipis co-directs the Human Generosity Project with Dr. Lee Cronk of Rutgers University. Together with the team, Drs. Aktipis and Cronk study the relationship between biological and cultural influences on human generosity by using multiple methodologies such as field work, laboratory experiments, and computational models.[7]/nMicrobes have access to many systems underlying human behavior.[8] In her lab, Aktipis and colleagues explore how the microbiome may play a role in eating behavior and social behaviors./nKombucha is a popular drink made by the fermentation of tea by symbiotic bacteria and yeast.[9] Aktipis uses this beverage to explore microbial resource exchange and to determine whether the kombucha symbiosis is able to fight off pathogens that single species of microbes cannot./nMulticellular bodies are societies of cells that must cooperate and coordinate to contribute to organism fitness. Cancer represents a breakdown of multicellular cooperation.[10] Aktipis examines cancer through this lens, using evolutionary theory, computational modeling, and clinical collaborations.

To do this, she has utilised the genetic diversity of Australian animals (specifically the kangaroo, platypus, Tasmanian devils and dragons (lizards)). Her work had led to significant and influential new theories on the origin and evolution of the human sex chromosomes and sex determination, including the controversial prediction that the human Y chromosome is disappearing.[4] She also made the critical discovery that the epigenetic silencing of mammalian X chromosomes occurs by transcriptional inhibition, and that this is mediated by DNA methylation. In the mid-1980s, Graves became involved in international comparative gene mapping and sequencing projects, where she promoted the value of including distantly related species in comparative genomics analyses and initiated projects to sequence the genomes of Australian marsupials and the platypus.

Sex determination in placental mammals (including marsupials) results from a testis-determining gene on the Y chromosome. Via comparative genomics, Graves and Sinclair showed that ZFY is found on chromosome 5 in kangaroos and chromosome 3 in the fat-tailed dunnart rather than the Y chromosome, and therefore could not be involved in determining sex.[11][12] Sinclair later showed that SRY was in fact the gene responsible for sex determination in mammals.[13][12]/nFollowing this, Graves discovered that the platypus sex chromosomes are homologous to the bird ZW rather than conserved with the mammalian XY. Owing to this work, the emergence of mammalian sex chromosomes could be dated back to between 160-190 million years ago, between the divergence of therian mammals from monotremes and the divergence of the marsupial-eutherian species.[12]/nGraves' work on sex determination led to the discovery that the Australian reptile the dragon lizard exhibits both genetic and temperature dependent sex determination. At normal temperatures, the sex of offspring is determined via genetic factors (ZZ male, ZY female) as two copies of this Z-borne gene (ZZ) are required to induce testis formation. At higher temperatures, however, all hatchlings are female. It is proposed that this occurs due to heat inactivation of a dose sensitive Z-borne gene, resulting in ZZ hatchlings with insufficient sex determination product. Due to this reduced dose, ZZ hatchlings develop into sex-reversed females.[14][15] This work condradicted the prevailing hypothesis at the time that genetic and temperature dependent sex determining systems were fundamentally different.", "1688459": "Henry George Friesen CC OM FRSC (born July 31, 1934) is a Canadian endocrinologist, a distinguished professor emeritus of the University of Manitoba and the discoverer of human prolactin,[1] a hormone which stimulates lactation in mammary glands./nBorn in Morden, Manitoba, he obtained a Bachelor of Science in medicine and a medical degree from the University of Manitoba in 1958.

Baer was a naturalist, biologist, geologist, meteorologist, geographer, and is considered a, or the, founding father of embryology.  He was a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, a co-founder of the Russian Geographical Society, and the first president of the Russian Entomological Society, making him one of the most distinguished Baltic German scientists./nKarl Ernst von Baer was born into the Baltic German noble Baer family (et) in the Piep Manor (et), Jerwen County, Governorate of Estonia (in present-day L\u00e4\u00e4ne-Viru County, Estonia), as a knight by birthright. His patrilineal ancestors were of Westphalian origin and originated in Osnabr\u00fcck. He spent his early childhood at Lasila manor, Estonia.[3][4][5][6]  He was educated at the Knight and Cathedral School in Reval (Tallinn) and the Imperial University of Dorpat (Tartu). In 1812, during his tenure at the university, he was sent to Riga to aid the city after Napoleon's armies had laid siege to it. As he attempted to help the sick and wounded, he realized that his education at Dorpat had been inadequate, and upon his graduation, he notified his father that he would need to go abroad to \"finish\" his education.  In his autobiography, his discontent with his education at Dorpat inspired him to write a lengthy appraisal of education in general, a summary that dominated the content of the book.  After leaving Tartu, he continued his education in Berlin, Vienna, and W\u00fcrzburg, where Ignaz D\u00f6llinger introduced him to the new field of embryology./nIn 1817, he became a professor at K\u00f6nigsberg University and full professor of zoology in 1821, and of anatomy in 1826. In 1829, he taught briefly in St Petersburg, but returned to K\u00f6nigsberg (Kaliningrad). In 1834, Baer moved back to St Petersburg and joined the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences, first in zoology (1834\u201346) and then in comparative anatomy and physiology (1846\u201362). His interests while there were anatomy, ichthyology, ethnography, anthropology, and geography. While embryology had kept his attention in K\u00f6nigsberg, then in Russia von Baer engaged in a great deal of field research, including the exploration of the island Novaya Zemlya. The last years of his life (1867\u201376) were spent in Dorpat, where he became a major critic of Charles Darwin.[7]/nvon Baer studied the embryonic development of animals, discovering the blastula stage of development and the notochord. Together with Heinz Christian Pander and based on the work by Caspar Friedrich Wolff, he described the germ layer theory of development (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) as a principle in a variety of species, laying the foundation for comparative embryology in the book \u00dcber Entwickelungsgeschichte der Thiere (1828). In 1826, Baer discovered the mammalian ovum. The human ovum was first described by Edgar Allen in 1928. In 1827, he completed research Ovi Mammalium et Hominis genesi for St Petersburg's Academy of Science (published at Leipzig[8][9]). In 1827 von Baer became the first person to observe human ova.[10][11] Only in 1876 did Oscar Hertwig prove that fertilization is due to fusion of an egg and sperm cell.[12]/nvon Baer formulated what became known as Baer's laws of embryology:/nBaer was a genius scientist covering not only the topics of embryology and ethnology, he also was especially interested in the geography of the northern parts of Russia, and explored Novaya Zemlya in 1837. In these arctic environments, he was studying periglacial features, permafrost occurrences, and collecting biological specimens. Other travels led him to subarctic regions of the North Cape and Lapland, but also to the Caspian Sea. He was one of the founders of the Russian Geographical Society.[13]/nThanks to Baer's research expeditions, the scientific investigation of permafrost began in Russia. Baer recorded the importance of permafrost research even before 1837 when observing in detail the geothermal gradient from a 116.7 m deep shaft in Yakutsk. At the end of the 1830s, he recommended sending expeditions to explore permafrost in Siberia and suggested Alexander von Middendorff as leader. Baer's expedition instructions written for Middendorff comprised over 200 pages. Baer summarized his knowledge in 1842/43 in a print-ready typescript. The German title is \u201eMaterialien zur Kenntniss des unverg\u00e4nglichen Boden-Eises in Sibirien\u201c (=materials for the knowledge of the perennial ground ice in Siberia). This world's first permafrost textbook was conceived as a complete work for printing. But it remained lost for more than 150 years. However, from 1838 onwards, Baer published a larger number of small publications on permafrost. Numerous of Baer's papers on permafrost were already published as early as 1837 and 1838. Well known was his paper \"On the Ground Ice or Frozen Soil of Siberia\", published in the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society of London (1838, pp.\u00a0210\u2013213)[14] and reprinted 1839 in the American Journal of Sciences and Arts by S. Silliman.[15] There are many other publications and small notes on permafrost by Baer, as shown in the Karl Ernst von Baer museum in Tartu (Estonia), now part of the Estonian University of Life Sciences./nThere are quite a number of studies in Russian about the origin of permafrost research. Russian authors usually relate with it the name Alexander von Middendorff (1815\u20131894), as he did much scientific work during the years 1842\u20131845 concerning permafrost on Taimyr Peninsula and in East-Siberia. However, Russian scientists during the 1940s also realized, that it was K. E. Baer who initiated this expedition and that the origin of scientific permafrost research must be fixed with Baer's thorough earlier scientific work. They even believed, that the scepticism about the permafrost findings and publications of Middendorff would not have risen, if Baer's original \"materials for the study of the perennial ground-ice\" would have been published in 1842 as intended. This was realized also by the Russian Academy of Sciences that honoured Baer with the publication of a tentative Russian translation done already in 1842 by Sumgin. These facts were completely forgotten until after the Second World War./nIn North America, permafrost research started after the Second World War with the creation of the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL), a division of the US army. It was realized that the understanding of frozen ground and permafrost are essential factors in strategic northern areas during the Cold War. In the Soviet Union, the Melnikov Permafrost Institute in Yakutsk had similar aims. The first post-World War major contact between groups of senior Russian and American frozen ground researchers took place in November 1963 in Yakutsk.However, Baer's permafrost textbook remained still undiscovered./nThus in 2001 the discovery and annotated publication of the typescript from 1843 in the library archives of the University of Giessen was a scientific sensation. The full text of Baer's work is available online (234 pages).[16] The editor Lorenz King added to the facsimile reprint a preface in English, two colour permafrost maps of Eurasia and some figures of permafrost features. Baer's text is introduced with detailed comments and references on additional 66 pages written by the Estonian historian Erki Tammiksaar./nThe work is fascinating to read, because both Baer's observations on permafrost distribution and his periglacial morphological descriptions are largely still correct today. He distinguished between \"continental\" and \"insular\" permafrost, saw the temporary existence of permafrost and postulated the formation and further development of permafrost as a result of the complex physio-geographical, geological and floristic site conditions. With his permafrost classification Baer laid the foundation for the modern permafrost terminology of the International Permafrost Association. With his compilation and analysis of all available data on ground ice and permafrost, Karl Ernst von Baer must be given the attribute \"founder of scientific permafrost research\"./nFrom his studies of comparative embryology, Baer had believed in the transmutation of species but rejected later in his career the theory of natural selection proposed by Charles Darwin. He produced an early tree-like branching diagram illustrating the sequential origins of derived character states in vertebrate embryos during ontogeny that implies a pattern of phylogenetic relationship.[17]/nIn the fifth edition of On the Origin of Species published in 1869, Charles Darwin added a Historical Sketch giving due credit to naturalists who had preceded him in publishing the opinion that species undergo modification, and that the existing forms of life have descended by true generation from pre-existing forms. According to Darwin:/nBaer believed in a teleological force in nature which directed evolution (orthogenesis).[20][21]/nThe term Baer's law is also applied to the unconfirmed proposition that in the Northern Hemisphere, erosion occurs mostly on the right banks of rivers, and in the Southern Hemisphere on the left banks. In its more thorough formulation, which Baer never formulated himself, the erosion of rivers depends on the direction of flow, as well. For example, in the Northern Hemisphere, a section of river flowing in a north\u2013south direction, according to the theory, erodes on its right bank due to the coriolis effect,[22] while in an east\u2013west section there is no preference. However, this was repudiated by Albert Einstein's tea leaf paradox./nIn 1849, he was elected a foreign honorary of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[23] He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1850. He was the president of the Estonian Naturalists' Society in 1869\u20131876, and was a co-founder and first president of the Russian Entomological Society.[24][25][26][27] In 1875, he became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[28]/nA statue honouring him can be found on Toome Hill in Tartu, as well as at Lasila manor, Estonia, and at the Zoological Museum in St Petersburg, Russia.[citation needed] In Tartu, there is also located Baer House which also functions as Baer Museum.[29]/nBefore the Estonian conversion to the euro, the 2-kroon bank note bore his portrait. Baer Island in the Kara Sea was named after Karl Ernst von Baer for his important contributions to the research of arctic meteorology between 1830 and 1840.[30] A duck, Baer's pochard, was also named after him.", "70370217": "Project Hail Mary is a 2021 science fiction novel by American novelist Andy Weir.  Set in the near future, it centers on junior high (middle) school-teacher-turned-astronaut Ryland Grace, who wakes up from a coma afflicted with amnesia. He gradually remembers that he was sent to the Tau Ceti solar system, 12 light-years from Earth, to find a means of reversing a solar dimming event that could cause the extinction of humanity.[1]/nIt received generally positive reviews, and was a finalist for the 2022 Hugo Award for Best Novel.[2] The unabridged audiobook is read by Ray Porter.[3] Film rights have been purchased by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Drew Goddard (who adapted The Martian, Weir's traditional publishing debut, into a 2015 film) is slated to adapt the book into a film, in which actor Ryan Gosling plans to star as Grace.[4]/nThe story follows two storylines, each told chronologically, starting with the story on board the spacecraft Hail Mary where Ryland Grace regains his memory in bursts. This story is frequently intercut with flashbacks revealing earlier events leading up to the launch of the Hail Mary./nIn the near future, a global dimming event is observed, coinciding with the formation of a bright line from the Sun to Venus. The exponential rate of dimming is calculated to result in a catastrophic ice age within 30 years. A space probe is used to discover that the line appears to contain alien microbes. The world's governments cooperate, giving former European Space Agency (ESA) administrator Eva Stratt unilateral authority and legal immunity to solve the problem./nStratt nominates Ryland Grace, a teacher and former molecular biologist, as the first person to study a sample of the organism recovered from Venus, as she views him as expendable and his research as a molecular biologist had predicted the type of life the sample is suspected to be. He discovers that the single-celled organism consumes all forms of electromagnetic radiation and uses radiant energy to move. Since the organism consumes energy from the Sun, Grace names it \"Astrophage\" (Greek for \"star eater\"). Grace subsequently discovers that Astrophage reproduces by feeding on the heat of the Sun and carbon dioxide on Venus. Other scientists discover that Astrophage employs mass\u2013energy conversion via neutrinos, and can be mass-bred for use as rocket fuel./nAstronomy data reveals that Astrophage has also infected and dimmed nearby stars, but one star, Tau Ceti, has unexpectedly resisted Astrophage infection. An Astrophage-fueled starship, the Hail Mary, is developed to travel to Tau Ceti to obtain knowledge of Astrophage resistance, and to return the findings to Earth with unmanned mini-ships (\"beetles\", with each named after their respective Beatle counterpart). Hail Mary can only be fueled and supplied for a one-way trip, making it a suicide mission./nStratt orders the release of methane from Antarctica to reduce global cooling, but the threat of famine and wars over food on Earth remains for the 26 years that the Hail Mary mission is expected to take./nSince the crew of three astronauts will travel under a coma to avoid psychiatric issues, potential astronauts are restricted to people with coma-resistant genes, including Grace. Stratt tasks Grace to train the science experts for the mission, but the science experts are killed in an Astrophage-induced explosion shortly before launch. With no time to train a replacement, Stratt asks Grace to join the mission. When he declines, she forces him. Grace threatens sabotage, so a sedative is administered to him before launch, with a temporary amnesia-inducing drug set to be administered shortly before he awakens./nRyland Grace emerges from his coma with no memory of his identity or situation. As the mission proceeds, Grace deduces his situation while his memory returns gradually. Grace finds that his crew members have died en route, and gives them a space burial./nHail Mary soon reaches Tau Ceti, and is approached by an alien starship, which Grace names \"Blip-A\". The other ship indicates that its home system in 40 Eridani is also plagued by Astrophage infection. Blip-A docks with Hail Mary, and the two ships establish first contact. Grace develops a system to communicate with the spider-like alien, whom Grace names \"Rocky\" due to its stone-like exoskeleton. Rocky, a skilled engineer, has been in the Tau Ceti system for 46 years as the last survivor of his crew; Grace deduces that the others died from space radiation, an unknown concept to Eridians./nAlso unfamiliar with the concept of relativity, the Eridians greatly overestimated the amount of fuel needed for a round-trip to Tau Ceti, and the Blip-A has enough Astrophage fuel for both ships to return to their planets. Grace realizes that what was once a suicide mission now may end with him returning to Earth. He fantasizes about confronting Stratt for coercing him to go./nGrace and Rocky discover the Astrophage's home planet in orbit around Tau Ceti, which Rocky names after his mate. Grace deciding on \"Adrian\" as the English translation, after Adrian Pennino, the wife of the fictional Rocky Balboa (i.e., the planet is now named for this other \"Rocky's mate\"). The planet's atmosphere is found to contain a natural predator of Astrophage. While collecting a sample from Adrian, a hull breach occurs and Grace and Rocky both risk their lives to save each other. Grace is severely burned when saving Rocky, who sustained severe injuries but eventually recovers. From the sample, the Astrophage predator is found to be a microbe which Grace names \"Taumoeba\"./nAfter a Taumoeba outbreak on the Hail Mary, where all Astrophage in the ship's fuel tanks are consumed by the Taumoeba, Grace and Rocky are captured in a decaying orbit over Adrian. They escape by mounting the beetles on the ship's hull and using them as mini thrusters. Grace and Rocky then use selective breeding to produce Taumoeba that can survive in both their home solar systems./nRocky refuels the Hail Mary, and they part ways. En route, Grace discovers that he has accidentally bred into the Taumoeba the ability to permeate and escape their containers. Although Grace fixes the problem on Hail Mary, he realizes that the Blip-A is made of the same material as those containers, and that the Taumoeba would have consumed its fuel, leaving Rocky stranded./nDue to a limited food supply, Grace is forced to choose between personally returning to Earth as a hero but dooming the Eridians, or saving Rocky and the Eridians but then starving to death on Erid (where the environment can't produce food for him). Grace chooses the latter, sending the beetles back to Earth with the Taumoeba, while he locates the fuel-less Blip-A and reunites with Rocky three months after their departure. Rocky is overjoyed and points out the possibility that Grace could consume Taumoeba, giving him a chance at survival./nThey return to Erid, fixing the Eridians' Astrophage problem. Using the digital archive of human knowledge given to Grace by Stratt, the Eridians build a system to enable Grace to live on Erid, where he becomes a teacher of Eridian young. Around 16 years later (the amount of time it takes for light from our sun to travel to Erid), Rocky tells Grace that the Astrophage infection around the Sun has abated too, meaning Grace's mission was a success and that Earth's scientists figured out a solution after the return of the beetles. Knowing that humanity has survived on Earth, Grace considers returning to Earth, with the Hail Mary still operational and in orbit around Erid but decides against it since he has friends on Erid (especially Rocky) and he finds his new teaching career rewarding./nIn a profile in The New York Times, Weir says that after completing The Martian, he began a multi-volume space opera called Zhek, about a substance that could absorb electromagnetic radiation and be used as a fuel for interstellar travel. He wrote 75,000 words before abandoning the project and beginning his novel Artemis (2017). Several elements from Zhek were brought over to Project Hail Mary, including a ruthless bureaucrat character, and an energy-absorbing substance used as starship fuel.[6]/nProject Hail Mary was released on May 4, 2021, by Ballantine Books. It is available in hardcover, e-book, and audiobook formats. The audiobook narrated by Ray Porter uses melodic sound effects in the background whenever \"Rocky\" speaks./nProject Hail Mary has received generally positive reviews. Writing for The New York Times, sci-fi author Alec Nevala-Lee wrote \"For readers who can forgive its shortcomings, the result is an engaging space odyssey.\"[7] Kirkus Reviews gave the book a starred review, describing it as \"An unforgettable story of survival and the power of friendship\u2014nothing short of a science-fiction masterwork.\"[8]/nIn writing her review for The Washington Post, SFWA president and science fiction writer Mary Robinette Kowal mentions that there are plenty of things to love about this book, such as Grace's infectious enthusiasm for science. At the same time, Kowal mentions some of the many flaws in the novel, such as the lack of the use of checklists, which are very important in the fields of aviation, astronautics, and medicine in reducing human-induced errors which Grace seems to ignore and could have prevented him from making his many errors in judgment.[9]/nA reviewer for Locus Magazine wrote, \"Project Hail Mary, however, isn\u2019t a simple rehash of The Martian. Instead, it\u2019s a celebration of Weir\u2019s voice... Weir\u2019s jaunty blend of science and fiction in Project Hail Mary is a return to the work that got him where he is.\"[10] The reviewer for The Boston Globe wrote that \"Project Hail Mary is still a suspenseful space yarn that zigs and zags \u2014 sometimes literally \u2014 in ingenious directions.\"[11]/nProject Hail Mary debuted at number 3 on The New York Times Best Seller list for Combined Print & E-Book Fiction in May 2021.[12] By August 2021, the book had been on the NYT list for 9 weeks.[13] Project Hail Mary additionally achieved the #1 spot on the New York Times Audio Fiction Best Seller List for three weeks in February 2022.[14][15]/nThe novel debuted at number 2 on the Los Angeles Times SoCal Bestsellers for Hardcover Fiction[16] and number 6 on The Wall Street Journal Bestselling Books List for Hardcover Fiction[17] during the same month.

In 1823 he began the illustration and publishing of the journal Scottish cryptogamic flora which he dedicated to his friend Hooker. In the following year he published his guide to the flora of Edinburgh, \"Flora Edinensis\".[8] Partially as a result of these publications[6] Greville was awarded a doctorate by the University of Glasgow in 1826.[9] He gave a large number of lectures in the natural sciences and built up collections that were bought by the University of Edinburgh. His specimens of plants and fungi are now held in the Herbarium of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh./nAt some point in late 1826 or early in 1827, he took a boat trip to the Isle of May with two students, William Ainsworth and Charles Darwin. To their amusement, this \"eminent cryptogamist\" laughed so much at screeching seabirds that he had to \"lie down on the greensward to enjoy his prolonged cachinnation.\"[10]/nIn 1828 he received an honour when Mount Greville in Queensland was named in Greville's honour by a fellow botanist, Allan Cunningham.

Some of his research was conducted using radioactive acetate in bread mold: this was possible because fungi also produce squalene. He confirmed his results using rats. He was one of several researchers who showed that acetyl Coenzyme A is turned into mevalonic acid.

Nesse became professor emeritus at Michigan at the end of 2013.[4]/nSince 2014, Nesse became professor of life sciences and ASU Foundation Professor at Arizona State University, where he became the Founding Director of the Center for Evolution and Medicine. He was previously a professor of psychiatry, professor of psychology and research professor at the University of Michigan where he led the Evolution and Human Adaptation Program and helped to establish one of the world's first anxiety disorders clinics and conducted research on neuroendocrine responses to fear.[5]/nNesse's research on the evolution of aging led to a long collaboration with the evolutionary biologist George C. Williams.[6] Their co-authored book, Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine, inspired fast growth of the field of evolutionary medicine.[7] His subsequent research has focused on how natural selection shapes mechanisms that regulate pain, fever, anxiety, low mood, and why emotional disorders are so common. He also has written extensively about the evolutionary origins of moral emotions, and strategies for establishing evolutionary biology as a basic science for medicine.  Good Reasons for Bad Feelings: Insights from the Frontier of Evolutionary Psychiatry applies the principles of evolutionary medicine to mental disorders.[8]/nNesse was the initial organizer and second president of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society, and is currently the president of the International Society for Evolution, Medicine & Public Health.

Labs with a rare nervous system disorder that short-circuited the electrical impulses in his brain, creating painful and uncontrollable seizures. When he could not find a cure, he secretly contacted the criminal organization SKULL, and they implanted him with a radium-powered device designed to harness his neural disorder into deadly atomic \"brain-blasts\" in exchange for him becoming their agent.[3] However, these mental blasts were difficult to control and only made his condition worse, a situation that he blamed on Superman after the Man of Steel captured the only SKULL scientists who could have cured him. Swearing revenge, the evil genius donned his distinctive yellow and green costume with its visored, cowl-topped skull mask, called himself the Atomic Skull, and eventually became the organization's leader, flying around in a sleek skull-shaped hovercraft of his own design and assisted by his similarly costumed lover Felicia, who was a panther that he had artificially evolved into human form./nFollowing Crisis on Infinite Earths, Michaels made one appearance, battling Thunder and Lightning in Teen Titans Spotlight. It is assumed that his background has not changed, although instead of being diagnosed with a nervous disorder, it was said that his powers came because he sought immortality and presumably mutated himself. It is not known if he ever fought the Post-Crisis version of Superman before, as his first (Post-Crisis) appearance was in Captain Atom, yet his history with S.T.A.R. Labs and SKULL remained as established in The DC Comics Encyclopedia./nMichaels returned in 2007 in Birds of Prey.[4] He also appeared in the miniseries Villains United, where he joined Luthor's Society.[5]/nStudent Joseph Martin was at S.T.A.R. Labs for a routine check-up when it was struck by an intense blast of energy from the Dominators' gene-bomb that gave him superhuman strength and caused his flesh to become invisible. Later attacked by some thugs, the resulting brain damage caused insanity, and he took on the guise of \"the Atomic Skull\" who was a hero from an old movie serial that he loved. He also emitted dangerous amounts of radiation, later gaining the ability to project it as energy blasts. He has plagued Superman, whom he believed to be the serial's villain Doctor Electron (particularly when Superman had currently acquired electricity-based powers), and Lois Lane, whom he saw as the Skull's love interest, Zelda Wentworth.[6]/nHe was later given enhanced powers by the demon Neron in exchange for his soul.[7] Cured of his delusions, he at first intended to follow the character's example for real as a superhero, but has since appeared as a more conventional supervillain./nHe is killed in battle by the Maximums,[8] an alternate reality superhero team, but is later seen alive in the pages of Action Comics,[9] assuming that Mr. Mxyzptlk reversed his death, along with other events having to do with the Maximums./nRecently, Martin crashed a movie premiere in Hollywood, having become obsessed with an actress who was in the film. He was defeated by Manhunter.[10]/nMartin was among the villains in the ambush of the JSA led by the Tapeworm.[11]/nWhile Superman is off-world, Martin attempts to cause trouble in downtown Metropolis, but is defeated by Mon-El.[12]/nIn The New 52 reboot launched in 2011, the Joseph Martin version of the Atomic Skull is re-introduced in Action Comics vol. 2 Annual #1, penned by Chronicle writer Max Landis.[13]/nWhen a S.T.A.R. Labs submarine crashes far below the surface of the ocean, one of its scientists is exposed to experimental radiation. He is washed to shore, with memories of the life he had, and the woman he loved and lost. Alone on a desert island, he fights to survive, eating the local, tropical vegetation. When a leopard finds and attacks him, he unexpectedly emits a blast of radiation that vaporizes the big cat's body. Eventually, he learns to use this power to his benefit, killing animals for food, and blasting away holes in the rock faces for shelter. The radiation soon takes its toll on him, as he remembers how he had caught his wife flirting with someone at a dance club and murdered her in a jealous rage. In anger, he destroys most of the island. His face, meanwhile, practically melts away, revealing his radioactive skull.[14][15]/nIn DC Rebirth, the Atomic Skull is seen imprisoned in Kamen Maximum Security Prison in Superwoman #1.[16]/nIn Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #45, the Atomic Skull is shown trying to make amends by being the warden at Stryker's Island Penitentiary. When Hal Jordan tried to break out Hector Hammond, the Atomic Skull fought him, but before he could do anything else, Hector Hammond renders him temporarily brain dead using his psychic powers and Hal Jordan convinces him to let the Atomic Skull live.[17]/nAlbert Michaels can deliver powerful energy bolts through the visor of his mask. These blasts have been described as unique brainwaves, heat vision, and radioactive energy throughout the years. Beside from his energy attacks, Michaels is an experienced leader of the SKULL organization and a brilliant scientist.[18]/nJoseph Martin has immense strength, stamina, and durability, comparable to that of Superboy (Kon-El), Superman, and Lar Gand. He can also project blasts of purple atomic energy from his hands or mouth for long-range attacks and use the same one to power himself up in a higher degree.[19]/nThe Atomic Skull is the name of Joseph Martin's favorite hero from a (fictional) 12-episode movie serial made by National Film Studios in 1936. The serial stars Lawrence Dennis (according to Superman Villains Secret Files and Origins #1) as the titular character. This Atomic Skull was originally government agent Joe Martin who investigated the evil Doctor Electron and was transformed into the hideous Atomic Skull by one of Electron's inventions. Despite this, he and Zelda Wentworth, Electron's daughter (played by actress Eleanor Hart, whom Lois Lane has a passing resemblance to[20]), fell in love. Battling Electron and his minions (such as Rocketman) with his heat ray eye-blasts, the Atomic Skull eventually destroyed the mad scientist's plans and returned to normal. The fictional character from the serial is visually identical to Albert Michaels, the Pre-Crisis version of the Atomic Skull./nIn a story featuring the reality-altering villain Dominus recreating various Pre-Crisis Superman continuities, the supposed Golden Age Atomic Skull was first introduced. He was Lawrence Dennis, an actor and Nazi sympathizer who used his reputation as the hero of the serial Curse of the Atomic Skull as a platform to promote Nazism./nThe Atomic Skull is featured in the alternate reality Superman: Red Son as one of Lex Luthor's experiments.[21]/nIn the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint event, a version of the Atomic Skull is imprisoned in the military Doom prison and is working to keep the other prisoners in, as he recognizes that he is a bigger fish in jail than he would ever be in the real world.[22]/nThe Joseph Martin incarnation of the Atomic Skull appears as a character summon in Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure.[23]/nThe Albert Michaels incarnation of the Atomic Skull appears in a special one-shot for the Young Justice tie-in comic book published for Free Comic Book Day.", "62145523": "John Francis Xavier Diffley FRS FMedSci (born 4 March 1958) is an American biochemist and Associate Research Director at the Francis Crick Institute.[1] He is known for his contributions to the understanding of how DNA replication is initiated, and how it is subsequently regulated throughout the cell cycle and in response to DNA damage.[2]/nDiffley was educated at New York University, obtaining his Ph.D. in 1985.

His scientific aptitude meant he got along well with the super-intelligent Brainiac 5. His abilities made him a valuable asset to the Legion Espionage Squad, of which he was a permanent member. Norg also served one term as Legion Leader. He was killed by the monster Validus of the Fatal Five in Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes #203 (July/August 1974).[7]/nMany years later, during the \"Five Year Gap\" following the Magic Wars, Earth fell under the covert control of the Dominators, and withdrew from the United Planets. A few years later, the members of the Dominators' highly classified \"Batch SW6\" escaped captivity. Originally, Batch SW6 appeared to be a group of teenage Legionnaire clones, created from samples apparently taken just prior to Ferro Lad's death at the hands of the Sun-Eater. Later, they were revealed to be time-paradox duplicates, every bit as legitimate as their older counterparts. After Earth was destroyed in a disaster reminiscent of the destruction of Krypton over a millennium earlier,[8] a few dozen surviving cities and their inhabitants reconstituted their world as New Earth. The SW6 Legionnaires\u2014including their version of Invisible Kid\u2014remained./nFollowing the Zero Hour Legion reboot, Lyle Norg was still alive and serving with the Legion. As well as a brilliant chemist, he was also a professional spy at a young age. He invented the invisibility serum while in Earthgov Intelligence's spy school. Rather than his scientific aptitude resulting in his getting on well with Brainiac 5, they had more of a rivalry. While Querl was more intelligent, Lyle had more imagination, being quicker to see unexpected applications for discoveries./nHe was the de facto leader of the Legion Espionage Squad, consisting of himself, Chameleon, Apparition, Triad, and Shrinking Violet, and was instrumental in bringing down the corrupt administration of United Planets President Chu./nLyle served one term as Legion Leader; during his tenure, this version of the Legion defeated Mordru in their first and only battle with the sorcerer./nAccording to The Definitive Guide to The Characters of the DC Universe (2004), he was in a homosexual relationship with Condo Arlik. This, however, was never stated explicitly in the comic itself and never developed./nLyle Norg is a genius with a skill for xenochemistry who was used by his father to develop an invisibility serum. His Science Police officer father used to bring him alien cell samples nearly every night to experiment with. By the time he had successfully created a serum, he discovered that his father promised to hand over Lyle's research to the Science Police all along. So he injected the only existing serum into himself and lied about it before contacting Brainiac 5 for help. Brainy invited Lyle to join the Legion. Eventually his father discovered the truth and tried to get Lyle to quit and hand over the serum. After the Legion was outlawed, Lyle reneged and produced a blood sample for his father to use. The sample was encoded with a monitoring virus allowing Legion access to the United Planets systemworks. Because of his relationship to Brainiac 5 his teammates have snarlingly nicknamed him \"Brainiac 6\"./nWhen Lyle betrayed Cosmic Boy's trust by revealing to Brainiac 5 that several members had broken into Brainy's lab, he lied to the team by blaming everything on Shrinking Violet. He and Violet, who prefers the moniker Atom Girl, have since made a deal to continue the ruse, but his teammates still have a hard time trusting him. When Supergirl mysteriously appeared in the 31st century, Lyle, along with half the male Legionnaires vied for her attention. However, Lyle convinced Cosmic Boy that he did not have a crush on Supergirl to remove the competition for her affections. He recently had his arm torn off when his flight ring exploded, and was given an alien arm to replace it by a member of the Wanderers. He is left in Metropolis, the doctors reproducing his DNA to give him another arm./nHis arm apparently healed, he returns to the active roster to save a young Tritonian mutant, Gazelle, for whom he carries a torch from then on.[9] During an invasion of aliens hailing from cyberspace, a small squad of legionnaires, including him and the recently appointed Gazelle, are digitized and sent into their home base: Invisible Lad has a customized avatar issued by Brainac 5, with a bulkier and more handsome physique that greatly impresses Gazelle. His idealized body is shown to be a trojan horse able to give Brainiac 5 complete mastery over the alien, digital universe. Invisible Kid, Gazelle and the other legionnaires spend some time trapped in cyberspace, while Brainiac 5 restores their physical bodies, damaged in a skirmish between the Coluan and some physical avatars of the invading aliens: in that week, Invisible Kid admits his feelings for Gazelle who happily reciprocates. Upon returning to the physical world, they both witness Brainiac 5 and Nura Nal exchanging their nuptial vows and inviting them to their marriage.[10]/nThe events of the Infinite Crisis miniseries have apparently restored a close analogue of the Pre-Crisis Legion to continuity, as seen in \"The Lightning Saga\" story arc in Justice League of America and Justice Society of America, and in the \"Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes\" story arc in Action Comics.  Lyle is depicted as a member of this version of the team in Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #5 (June 2007), and Action Comics #858 (late December 2007), but this incarnation of the Legion shares roughly the same history as the original Legion up to the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths.[11] Therefore, this version of Lyle is presumably deceased./nMany years later, Brainiac 5 was approached by Jacques Foccart, a teenage native of Earth from what was once the francophone African nation of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Jacques' younger sister Danielle was suffering from a life-threatening neurological disorder which had baffled the best medical experts of the 30th century, and Jacques took her to Brainiac 5 as a last resort. Brainiac 5 rashly decided to utilize a piece of circuitry from the dismantled machine Computo, a highly advanced supercomputer he had created years earlier. Computo promptly possessed Danielle's body. Computo took control of Legion headquarters and the city of Metropolis and nearly killed several Legionnaires. To save Danielle and the others, Jacques drank Lyle Norg's serum and gained the power of invisibility. Immediately thereafter, the Legion voted Jacques onto the team as its newest member. He took the name Invisible Kid in honor of Lyle.[12]/nWithin days of Jacques' addition to the team, the Legion faced a new foe whom they initially referred to as the Master of the Servants of Darkness. The Servants' Master possessed a myriad of superpowers, including the ability to generate teleportation tubes out of thin air, and after one encounter Jacques decided to follow him. The sight of the real face of the Servants' Master\u2014later revealed as the ancient villain Darkseid\u2014frightened Jacques so deeply that a large strip of his jet black hair turned permanently white.[13]/nJacques soon learned that, unlike his predecessor, he had also developed the ability to teleport and shift into other dimensions. This talent served him well when he and his teammate Wildfire were almost killed by a Lyle Norg imposter. However, when he caused the death of a criminal by accidentally teleporting him into space, Jacques had the additional powers removed. Jacques served as a permanent member of the Legion Espionage Squad, along with Chameleon Boy, Phantom Girl, and Shrinking Violet./nDuring the \"Five Year Gap\" following the Magic Wars, the Legion disbanded and Earth's government fell under the covert control of the Dominators, who had attempted to conquer the planet in the 20th century. Earth withdrew from the United Planets, and the government gradually became more repressive. Jacques became the leader of a resistance cell which included himself, Tyroc, and the former members of the Legion of Substitute Heroes. He became romantically involved with Drura Sepht, a Substitute Hero who once called herself Infectious Lass. He successfully led the resistance to victory over the Dominators, along with the unlikely assistance of former Legion foe Universo and the members of the Dominators' highly classified \"Batch SW6\"./nAt the time, Batch SW6 appeared to be a group of teenaged Legionnaire clones, created from samples apparently taken immediately following the team's first encounter with Universo.[14] Later, they were revealed to be time-paradox duplicates, every bit as legitimate as their older counterparts. In any event, the emergence of the SW6 Legionnaires allowed Jacques to meet their leader\u2014the real Lyle Norg\u2014for the first time./nAfter the defeat of the Dominators, Jacques became a planetary hero. The people of Earth rewarded his efforts by making him president of the planet, with Troy Stewart (Tyroc) serving as vice president. But soon thereafter, Earth was destroyed in a disaster reminiscent of Krypton's destruction over a millennium earlier.[15] A few dozen cities and their inhabitants survived, and the planet was reconstituted as New Earth. Eventually, Jacques resigned as president to rejoin the Legion (where he served as co-leader with Rokk Krinn), and Troy ascended to the presidency./nAfter Legion continuity was completed rebooted by the events of Zero Hour, Jacques was recast as a close friend of Lyle Norg from their days in school. Jacques was forced by Charma, a fellow student who had developed mind control abilities, to drink Lyle's serum as a test to see if it would be safe for her. Jacques was believed to have been killed by the serum, as Lyle had calibrated it to only work with his physiology. In truth, he was saved by the Intelligence Division. The serum worked differently for him than for Lyle, granting him the ability to become undetectable by any means, though this ability causes him severe pain to use. He continued to work for EarthGov's Intelligence. Some time after Lyle joined the Legion, Jacques would later save Lyle from Charma, though he could not reveal that he still lived.[16]/nJacques has not appeared in the \"Threeboot\" Legion continuity which began in 2005. However, the events of the Infinite Crisis miniseries have restored a close analogue of the Pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths Legion to continuity, as seen in \"The Lightning Saga\" story arc in Justice League of America and Justice Society of America, and in the \"Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes\" story arc in Action Comics. Jacques is included in their number. The events of the \"Five Years Later\" era (including Jacques' rise to the presidency of Earth) are no longer part of mainstream DC continuity./nSyfy ranked the first Invisible Kid as the 24th greatest Legion of Superheroes member, stating that during \"his time in the 1960s, Invisible Kid was a constant, but not noteworthy presence, until he was killed by Validus. When the Legion rebooted in 1994, he became a major player, showing he was one of the savviest members of the team\". Syfy ranked the second Invisible Kid as number 38 describing the character as \"boring\" and \"notable because of his name and his Rogue inspired haircut\".

His great nephew was the naval hero Eliab Harvey, captain of HMS Temeraire.[6]/nHarvey's initial education was carried out in Folkestone, where he learned Latin. He then entered the King's School (Canterbury). Harvey stayed at the King's School for five years, after which he matriculated at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge in 1593./nHarvey graduated as a Bachelor of Arts from Caius in 1597.[7] He then travelled through France and Germany to Italy, where he entered the University of Padua, in 1599./nDuring Harvey's years of study there, he developed a relationship with Fabricius and read Fabricius's De Venarum Ostiolis./nHarvey graduated as a Doctor of Medicine at the age of 24 from the University of Padua on 25 April 1602.

Following this, Harvey established himself in London, joining the Royal College of Physicians on 5 October 1604./nA few weeks after his admission, Harvey married Elizabeth Browne, \"daughter of Lancelot Browne Dr. Physic\" (a medical doctor).[9] They had no children.[citation needed]/nHarvey was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 5 June 1607, which earned him the Post-nominal letters FRCP.[10] He then accepted a position at St Bartholomew's Hospital that he was to occupy for almost all the rest of his life. Succeeding Dr Wilkinson on 14 October 1609, he became the Physician in charge at St\u00a0Bartholomew's Hospital, which enjoined him, \"in God's most holy name\" to \"endeavor yourself to do the best of your knowledge in the profession of physic to the poor then present, or any other of the poor at any time of the week which shall be sent home unto you by the Hospitaller... You shall not, for favor, lucre or gain, appoint or write anything for the poor but such good and wholesome things as you shall think with your best advice will do the poor good, without any affection or respect to be had to the apothecary.

This you will promise to do as you shall answer before God... \"[11]/nHarvey earned around thirty-three pounds a year and lived in a small house in Ludgate, although two houses in West Smithfield were attached as fringe benefits to the post of Physician. At this point, the physician's function consisted of a simple but thorough analysis of patients who were brought to the hospital once a week and the subsequent writing of prescriptions.[12]/nThe next important phase of Harvey's life began with his appointment to the office of Lumleian lecturer on 4 August 1615.[13] The Lumleian lectureship, founded by Lord Lumley and Dr. Richard Caldwell in 1582, consisted in giving lectures for a period of seven years, with the purpose of \"spreading light\" and increasing the general knowledge of anatomy throughout England.[14]/nHarvey began his lectures in April 1616.[15] At this time, at the age of thirty-seven, he was described as \"a man of lowest stature, round faced; his eyes small, round, very black and full of spirit; his hair as black as a raven and curling\".[16] The notes which he used at the time are preserved in the British Museum.[17]/nAt the beginning of his lectures, Harvey laid down the canons for his guidance:/nHarvey continued to participate in the Lumleian lectures while also taking care of his patients at St Bartholomew's Hospital; he thus soon attained an important and fairly lucrative practice, which climaxed with his appointment as 'Physician Extraordinary' to King James I on 3 February 1618. He seems to have similarly served various aristocrats, including Lord Chancellor Bacon.[19][20] Bacon entirely failed to impress the more practical-minded Harvey, who refused to regard him as a great philosopher. He said of him \"He writes philosophy like a Lord Chancellor.\"[21]/nIn 1628 he published in Frankfurt his completed treatise on the circulation of the blood, the De Motu Cordis. As a result of negative comments by other physicians Harvey \"fell mightily in his practice\",[22] but continued advancing his career. He was re-elected 'Censor' of the College of Physicians in 1629, having been elected for the first time in 1613 and the second time in 1625. Eventually, Harvey was also elected Treasurer of the College.[23]/nHarvey was a prominent sceptic regarding allegations of witchcraft. He was one of the examiners of four women from Lancashire accused of witchcraft in 1634, and as a consequence of his report, all of them were acquitted.[24][25] Earlier, in 1632, while travelling with the King to Newmarket, he had been sent to investigate a woman accused of being a witch. Initially, he told her that he was a wizard and had come to discuss the Craft with her, and asked whether she had a familiar. She put down a saucer of milk and called to a toad which came out and drank the milk. He then sent her out to fetch some ale, killed the toad and dissected it, concluding that it was a perfectly ordinary animal and not supernatural in any way. When the woman returned she was naturally very angry and upset, but Harvey eventually silenced her by stating that he was the King's Physician, sent to discover whether she was a witch, and if she were, to have her apprehended.[26]/nAt the age of fifty-two, Harvey received commands from the king to accompany the Duke of Lennox during his trip abroad. This voyage \u2013 the first after Harvey's return from Padua \u2013 lasted three years, taking Harvey through the countries of France and Spain during the Mantuan War and Plague. During this journey he wrote to Viscount Dorchester:/n\"I can complain that by the way we could scarce see a dog, crow, kite, raven or any other bird, or anything to anatomize, only some few miserable people, the relics of the war and the plague where famine had made anatomies before I came. It is scarce credible in so rich, populous, and plentiful countries as these were that so much misery and desolation, poverty and famine should in so short a time be, as we have seen. I interpret it well that it will be a great motive for all here to have and procure assurance of settled peace. It is time to leave fighting when there is nothing to eat, nothing to be kept, and nothing to be gotten\".[27]/nHaving returned to England in 1632. Harvey accompanied King Charles I wherever he went as 'Physician in Ordinary'. In particular, Charles's hunting expeditions gave Harvey access to many deer carcasses; it was upon them that Harvey made many observations and developed his theories. Harvey returned to Italy in October 1636, dining at the English College, Rome, as a guest of the Jesuits there. It is possible he met Galileo in Florence en route.[28]/nDuring the English Civil War a mob of citizen-soldiers opposed to the King entered Harvey's lodgings, stole his goods, and scattered his papers. The papers consisted of \"the records of a large number of dissections ... of diseased bodies, with his observations on the development on insects, and a series of notes on comparative anatomy.\"[29] During this period, Harvey maintained his position, helped the wounded on several occasions and protected the King's children during the Battle of Edgehill.[30]/nThe conflicts of the Civil War soon led King Charles to Oxford, with Harvey attending, where the physician was made \"Doctor of Physic\" in 1642 and later Warden of Merton College in 1645. \"In Oxford he (Harvey) very soon settled down to his accustomed pursuits, unmindful of the clatter of arms and of the constant marching and countermarching around him, for the city remained the base of operations until its surrender... \"[31]/nThe surrender of Oxford in 1645 marks the beginning of Harvey's gradual retirement from public life and duties. Now sixty-eight years old and childless, Harvey had lost three brothers and his wife by this time. He thus decided to return to London, and lived with his brothers Eliab and Daniel at different periods. Having retired from St Bartholomew's Hospital and his various other aforementioned positions, he passed most of this time reading general literature. Several attempts to bring Harvey back into the 'working world' were made, however; here is an excerpt of one of Harvey's answers:/n\"Would you be the man who should recommend me to quit the peaceful haven where I now pass my life and launch again upon the faithless sea? You know full well what a storm my former lucubrations raised. Much better is it oftentimes to grow wise at home and in private, than by publishing what you have amassed with infinite labour, to stir up tempests that may rob you of peace and quiet for the rest of your days.\"[32]/nHarvey died at Roehampton in the house of his brother Eliab on 3 June 1657. Descriptions of the event seem to show that he died of a cerebral haemorrhage from vessels long injured by gout: it is highly probable that the left middle cerebral artery malfunctioned, leading to a gradual accumulation of blood in the brain which eventually overwhelmed it. There exists a fairly detailed account of what happened on that day. Harvey/n\"went to speak and found that he had the dead palsy in his tongue; then he saw what was to become of him. He knew there were then no hopes of his recovery, so presently he sends for his young nephews to come up to him. He then made signs (for seized with the dead palsy in his tongue he could not speak) to let him blood his tongue, which did him little or no good, and so ended his days, dying in the evening of the day on which he was stricken, the palsy giving him an easy passport.\"[33]/nHis will distributed his material goods and wealth throughout his extended family and also left a substantial amount of money to the Royal College of Physicians./nHarvey was buried in St. Andrew's Church in Hempstead in northern Essex. The funeral procession started on 26 June 1657, leading Harvey to be placed in the 'Harvey Chapel' built by Eliab. The conditions of Harvey's burial are also known: \"Harvey was laid in the chapel between the bodies of his two nieces, and like them he was lapt in lead, coffin less\".[34] On St. Luke's Day, 18 October 1883, Harvey's remains were reinterred, the leaden case carried from the vault by eight Fellows of the College of Physicians, and deposited in a sarcophagus containing his works and an inscription:/n\"The body of William Harvey lapt in lead, simply soldered, was laid without shell or enclosure of any kind in the Harvey vault of this Church of Hempstead, Essex, in June 1657. In the course of time the lead enclosing the remains was, from expose and natural decay, so seriously damaged as to endanger its preservation, rendering some repair of it the duty of those interested in the memory of the illustrious discoverer of the circulation of the Blood. The Royal College of Physicians, of which corporate body Harvey was a munificent Benefactor did in the years 1882\u20131883, by permission of the Representatives of the Harvey family, undertake this duty. In accordance with this determination the leaden mortuary chest containing the remains of Harvey was repaired, and was, as far as possible, restored to its original state... \"[35]/nPublished in 1628 in the city of Frankfurt (host to an annual book fair that Harvey knew would allow immediate dispersion of his work), the 72-page Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus contains the mature account of the circulation of the blood. Opening with a dedication to King Charles I, the quarto has 17 chapters which give a clear and connected account of the action of the heart and the consequent movement of the blood around the body in a circuit. Having only a tiny lens at his disposal, Harvey was not able to reach the adequate pictures that were attained through such microscopes used by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek; thus he had to resort to theory \u2013 and not practical evidence \u2013 in certain parts of his book. After the first chapter, which simply outlines past ideas and accepted rules regarding the heart and lungs, Harvey moves on to a fundamental premise to his treatise, stating that it was important to study the heart when it was active in order to truly comprehend its true movement; a task which even he found of great difficulty, as he says:/n\"...I found the task so truly arduous... that I was almost tempted to think... that the movement of the heart was only to be comprehended by God. For I could neither rightly perceive at first when the systole and when the diastole took place by reason of the rapidity of the movement...\"[36]/nThis initial thought led Harvey's ambition and assiduousness to a detailed analysis of the overall structure of the heart (studied with fewer hindrances in cold-blooded animals). After this, Harvey analyses the arteries, showing how their pulsation depends upon the contraction of the left ventricle, while the contraction of the right ventricle propels its charge of blood into the pulmonary artery. Whilst doing this, the physician reiterates the fact that these two ventricles move together almost simultaneously and not independently as had been thought previously by his predecessors. This discovery was made while observing the heart of such animals as the eel and several other types of fish; indeed, the general study of countless animals was of utmost importance to Harvey's research: among the ones already cited, one can add the study of the snail, the invisible shrimp, the chick before its hatching and even the pigeon. A digression to an experiment can be made to this note: using the inactive heart of a dead pigeon and placing upon it a finger wet with saliva, Harvey was able to witness a transitory and yet incontrovertible pulsation. He had just witnessed the heart's ability to recover from fatigue.[37]\nAs early as the 17th century, William Harvey had already discerned the existence of the Ductus arteriosus and explained its relative function. Here he says, \"...in embryos, whilst the lungs are in a state of inaction, performing no function, subject to no movement any more than if they had not been present, Nature uses the two ventricles of the heart as if they formed but one for the transmission of the blood.\"[38] However, the apex of Harvey's work is probably the eighth chapter, in which he deals with the actual quantity of blood passing through the heart from the veins to the arteries. Coming into conflict with Galen's accepted view of the liver as the origin of venous blood, Harvey estimated the capacity of the heart, how much blood is expelled through each pump of the heart, and the number of times the heart beats in a half an hour. All of these estimates were purposefully low, so that people could see the vast amount of blood Galen's theory required the liver to produce. He estimated that the capacity of the heart was 1.5 imperial fluid ounces (43\u00a0ml), and that every time the heart pumps, 1\u20448 of that blood is expelled. This led to Harvey's estimate that about 1\u20446 imperial fluid ounce (4.7\u00a0ml) of blood went through the heart every time it pumped. The next estimate he used was that the heart beats 1,000 times every half an hour, which gave 10 pounds 6 ounces of blood in a half an hour, and when this number was multiplied by 48 half hours in a day he realised that the liver would have to produce 498 pounds of blood in a day, more than the weight of the whole body./nHaving this simple but essential mathematical proportion at hand \u2013 which proved the overall impossible aforementioned role of the liver \u2013 Harvey went on to prove how the blood circulated in a circle by means of countless experiments initially done on serpents and fish: tying their veins and arteries in separate periods of time, Harvey noticed the modifications which occurred; indeed, as he tied the veins, the heart would become empty, while as he did the same to the arteries, the organ would swell up.[39]/nThis process was later performed on the human body (in the image on the right): the physician tied a tight ligature onto the upper arm of a person. This would cut off blood flow from the arteries and the veins. When this was done, the arm below the ligature was cool and pale, while above the ligature it was warm and swollen. The ligature was loosened slightly, which allowed blood from the arteries to come into the arm, since arteries are deeper in the flesh than the veins. When this was done, the opposite effect was seen in the lower arm. It was now warm and swollen. The veins were also more visible since now they were full of blood. Harvey then noticed little bumps in the veins, which he realised were the valves of the veins discovered by his teacher, Hieronymus Fabricius. Harvey tried to push blood in the vein down the arm, but to no avail. When he tried to push it up the arm, it moved quite easily. The same effect was seen in other veins of the body, except the veins in the neck. Those veins were different from the others \u2013 they did not allow blood to flow up, but only down. This led Harvey to believe that the veins allowed blood to flow to the heart, and the valves maintained the one-way flow.[40]/nContrary to a popular misconception, Harvey did not predict the existence of capillaries. His observations convinced him that direct connection between veins and arteries are unnecessary; he wrote \"blood permeates the pores\" in the flesh and it is \"absorbed and imbibed from every part\" by the veins.[41]/nHarvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood was based on inference, not direct observation, and was incompatible with the prevailing paradigm at the time.[42] That paradigm held, among other things, that the blood could flow from one side of the heart to the other. Harvey knew that he was facing an uphill battle:/n\"But what remains to be said about the quantity and source of the blood which thus passes, is of so novel and unheard-of character that I not only fear injury to myself from the envy of a few, but I tremble lest I have mankind at large for my enemies, so much doth want and custom, that become as another nature, and doctrine once sown and that hath struck deep root, and respect for antiquity, influence all men\u00a0: still the die is cast, and my trust is in my love of truth, and the candour that inheres in cultivated minds.\"/nHarvey's premonitions[43] that his discovery would be met with scepticism, derision, and abuse, were entirely justified.[42] It took twenty years for his theory of the circulation of the blood to be generally accepted./nAt the time of Harvey's publication, Galen had been an influential medical authority for several centuries. Galen believed that blood passed between the ventricles by means of invisible pores. According to Galen's views, the venous system was quite separate from the arterial system, except when they came in contact through the unseen pores. Arabic scholar Ibn al-Nafis had disputed aspects of Galen's views, providing a model that seems to imply a form of pulmonary circulation in his Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's Canon (1242). Al-Nafis stated that blood moved from the heart to the lungs, where it mixed with air, and then back to the heart, from which it spread to the rest of the body.[44] Harvey's discoveries inevitably and historically came into conflict with Galen's teachings and the publication of his treatise De Motu Cordis incited considerable controversy within the medical community. Some doctors affirmed they would \"rather err with Galen than proclaim the truth with Harvey.\"[45][46] Galen incompletely perceived the function of the heart, believing it a \"productor of heat\", while the function of its affluents, the arteries, was that of cooling the blood as the lungs \"...fanned and cooled the heart itself\".[47] Galen thought that during dilation the arteries sucked in air, while during their contraction they discharged vapours through pores in the flesh and skin./nUntil the 17th century, two separate systems were thought to be involved in blood circulation: the natural system, containing venous blood which had its origin in the liver, and the vital system, containing arterial blood and the 'spirits' which flowed from the heart, distributing heat and life to all parts. Like bellows, it was thought the lungs fanned and cooled this vital blood./nIndependently of Ibn Al-Nafis, Michael Servetus identified pulmonary circulation, but this discovery did not reach the public because it was written down for the first time in the Manuscript of Paris in 1546.[48] It was later published in the theological work which caused his execution in 1553, almost all copies of which were destroyed. In: Christianismi Restitutio, Book V, the Aragonese Miguel Servet (Michel de Villeneuve, 1509?\u20131553) wrote: 'The blood is passed through the pulmonary artery to the pulmonary vein for a lengthy pass through the lungs, during which it becomes red, and gets rid of the sooty fumes by the act of exhalation'.[49] Ideas on circulation of blood were also proposed by the Spanish veterinarian-farrier Francisco de la Reyna in 1546.[50][51][52]/nPulmonary circulation was described by Renaldus Columbus, Andrea Cesalpino and Vesalius, before Harvey would provide a refined and complete description of the circulatory system./nHarvey's other major work was Exercitationes de generatione animalium (On Animal Generation), published in 1651. He had been working on it for many years but might never have finished it without the encouragement of his friend George Ent.[1]/nThe book starts with a description of the development of the hen's egg. The major part is theoretical, dealing with Aristotle's theories and the work of the physicians following Galen and up to Fabricius. Finally, he deals with embryogenesis in viviparous animals, especially hinds and does. The treatment is generally Aristotelian and limited by use of a simple magnifying lens./nNeedham claims the following achievements for this work.[53]/nHarvey's whalebone demonstration rod, tipped with silver, resides in the silver room of the museum of the Royal College of Physicians. He used it to point to objects during his lectures.[54]/nSeveral medical buildings and institutions are named after or otherwise commemorate Harvey. The Harveian Society of Edinburgh was founded in 1782 by Dr Andrew Duncan. The Society holds an annual Festival in honour of Harvey where the President of the Society delivers the Harveian Oration, followed by a formal dinner. The venue for the Festival alternates between the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. The Harveian Society of London is a medical society founded in 1831 based in The Medical Society of London, Chandos Street, in Cavendish Square.[55][56]\nThe Royal College of Physicians of London holds an annual lecture established by William Harvey in 1656 called the Harveian Oration.[57] \nThe Harvey Club of London was founded in Canada in 1919 and is based in the University of Western Ontario.[58] \nThe Harvey Society, found in 1905, is based in New York City and hosts an annual lecture series on recent advances in biomedical sciences.[59] The main lecture theatre of the School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge is named after William Harvey, who was an alumnus of the institute.[60] William Harvey Research Institute at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry is a research facility focussing on biochemical pharmacology, orthopaedic diseases, endocrinology, genomics, clinical pharmacology and translational medicine and therapeutics.[61] William Harvey Hospital in Ashford, Kent is named after him. Harvey's hometown of Folkestone, Kent also has a statue of him.[62]/nHarvey was seen as a \"...humorous but extremely precise man...\",[63] and that he was often so immersed in his own thoughts that he would often suffer from insomnia (cured with a simple walk through the house), and how he was always ready for an open and direct conversation. He also loved the darkness, for it is said that it was there where \"...he could best contemplate\", thus sometimes hiding out in caves. A heavy drinker of coffee, Harvey would walk out combing his hair every morning full of energy and enthusiastic spirit through the fields. We have also come to understand Harvey's somewhat unorthodox method of dealing with his gout, here cited completely: \"...his [Harvey's] cure was thus: he would sit with his legs bare...put them into a pail of water till he was almost dead with cold, then betake himself to his stove, and so 'twas gone\".[64]", "9159712": "Charles-Philippe Robin (4 June 1821 \u2013 6 October 1885) was a French anatomist, biologist, and histologist born in Jasseron, d\u00e9partement Ain./nHe studied medicine in Paris, and while still a student took a scientific journey with Hermann Lebert to Normandy and the Channel Islands, where they collected specimens for the Mus\u00e9e Orfila.

He lived a life of extraordinary variety, did some notable medical research, and made the first clear statement about natural selection.[1] He applied the idea to the origin of different skin colours in human races, and from the context it seems he thought it might be applied more widely. Charles Darwin said: \"[Wells] distinctly recognises the principle of natural selection, and this is the first recognition which has been indicated\".[2]/nWells was born in Charleston on 24 May 1757,[3] the second son of Mary and Robert Wells, a printer. His parents were Scots who had settled in South Carolina in 1753.[4] He is the brother of Louisa Susannah Wells and Helena Wells./nHe was sent to school in Dumfries, Scotland in 1768, at the age of 11, and after completing his preparatory school studies he attended the University of Edinburgh for a year./nWells returned to Charleston in 1771 and became a medical apprentice under Dr Alexander Garden, a naturalist and physician, who himself was a pupil of Charles Alston, Director of the Botanical Gardens in Edinburgh./nIn 1775, soon after the commencement of the American War of Independence, he left Charleston suddenly, and went to London in England. He had been called upon to sign a paper the object of which was to unite the people in a resistance to the claims of the British Government. This he would not do. In 1776 he returned to the University of Edinburgh to study medicine graduating with his medical degree in 1778. In the autumn he returned to London, and attended a course of William Hunter's lectures, took instructions in practical Anatomy, and became a surgeon's pupil at St Bartholomew's Hospital./nIn 1779 he went to Holland as a surgeon of the British Army attached to a Scottish regiment. There he received ill-treatment from his commanding officer, and resigned his commission. On the day on which he received his dismissal from the service, he challenged the officer to a duel: the officer refused to respond. Wells then moved to Leiden in the Netherlands and matriculated at the University of Leiden 19 Feb. 1780.[5][6] On this university he prepared his dissertation. This was the Inaugural Thesis, published at Edinburgh in 1780 when he took the degree of Doctor of Medicine; the subject of his thesis was Cold (De frigore).[7] The title description of his thesis is: Disputatio medica, inauguralis, de frigore ... - Edinburgi\u00a0: Balfour et Smellie, 1780.[8]/nEarly in 1781 he returned to Carolina to put his family's affairs in order.

The triumph is limited to the extent of being applied only to skin colour, and not, as Darwin and Wallace did, to the whole range of life.[16] A form of the idea had already been set out by an earlier Edinburgh author, James Hutton, but in that case the effect was limited to improvement of varieties rather than the formation of new species.[17]/nIn the 1780s, Wells and a few others had the idea that dew and frost occurred when the ground was a few degrees colder than the air above. But they thought the cold was caused by the dew and frost, not the other way around. In the autumn of 1811 Wells took some measurements and soon came to doubt his old idea. He began serious experiments soon after and published the results in August 1814. He compared the formation of dew under varying conditions of material, location, temperature, humidity, weather, cloud cover, season, and time of day.

It also shed fundamental new light on how evolution shapes the (self-interested) individual genes that collaborate to build organisms./nWith his wife (Zuzana Zachar), he demonstrated that transposon insertion mutations were responsible for most of the alleles used in the development of classical genetics.[6] He also collaborated with Carl Wu and Sarah Elgin (then at Harvard) on fundamental properties of metazoan chromatin structure.[7] In collaboration with Margaret Kidwell, then at Brown University, and Gerry Rubin, then at the Carnegie Institution, he carried out the molecular cloning of the P element transposon in Drosophila.[8] This work revolutionized the retrieval of genes in Drosophila and subsequently contributed to progress in metazoan molecular and developmental genetics.[9] He and his collaborators were the first to propose the use of P element transposon tagging to clone the first metazoan RNA polymerase subunit.[10] This work demonstrated that the P element is a recently invading parasite of the Drosophila genome and gene pool.

Hamilton\u2019s theory of kin selection (Benefit x Relatedness > Cost) and posits that the genus Homo evolved when an ancestral organism developed the ability to effectively manage non-kin conflicts of interests by lowering the cost of coercion between non-kin individuals (Benefit > Cost of Coercion + Cost of Cooperation).[24]/nThe theory, using precedents established in biological theory, proposes to explain many aspects of human social and sexual behavior. It proposed to account for the evolution of the human species from the advent of its phylogenetic branching from other hominins through physiological and behavioral adaptations until our current civilization.[25] This theory of human uniqueness claims to answer the fundamental scientific challenge posed by Charles Darwin, to explain the descent of man: how did the 'incremental' process of evolution by natural selection suddenly produce an utterly unprecedented kind of animal, humans? It suggests an explanation of human origins, and also of human properties (from speech to political/economic/religious behavior).[26]/nAccording to his theory, the cost to an enforcer of coercing a cheating individual into a cooperative effort, known as the free-rider problem, was lowered when a precursor species to humans developed a way to threaten adult conspecifics from a distance by evolving the ability to throw projectiles with sufficient skill to reliably injure the cheater, especially conjointly with others.[27] This reduced the personal risk to multiple enforcers as formulated by Lanchester's Square Law, when they gang up on a cheater.\n[28]\nThe theory proposes that this elite throwing ability initially allowed bands of proto-humans improved capacity to repel predators and scavenge their kills in the African savanna. \nIt was later adapted as threat projection towards free-riding conspecifics (cheaters) in non-kin cooperative groups\nthat made the cooperation evolutionarily stable against cheaters who, without coercion by this threat, would otherwise flourish and displace co-operators.[29]/nThe theory further generalizes to a theory of history,[24] claiming to account for many salient events of the two-million-year course of the human lineage\u2014from the evolution of the genus Homo to the inception of behavioral modernity to the Neolithic revolution[30] to the rise of the nation-state.[31][25][32]/nIn collaboration with Joanne Souza, he has developed a course [1] on the logic and implications of this new theory [2]./nBingham has served as the Faculty Director of the Freshmen College of Human Development at Stony Brook [3]./nBingham also serves on the management team of Rafael Pharmaceuticals, a firm developing cancer therapies, as Vice President of Research.

While she was attending Northwestern University as an undergraduate student, her sister developed a brain tumor. This event sparked a newfound passion for biology and specifically cancer research. While Brugge was completing her undergraduate degree in biology, she became interested in tumor virology, which refers to the study of how viruses can affect and in some cases produce cancerous cells.[6][7] This focus led her to the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, which housed one of the only virology programs in the country at the time.[2] Brugge graduated with her doctorate degree in virology in 1975.[8]/nAfter the completion of her doctorate degree, Brugge joined Dr. Ray Erikson at the University of Colorado for her postdoctorate work. It was there that she and Tony Purchio discovered the protein product of the Rous Sarcoma virus v-SRC gene.[9][10] Brugge subsequently identified the protein product of the cellular gene (c-Src) from which v-Src derived. These discoveries were major breakthroughs in cancer research, as v-SRC and c-Src were the first viral and cellular oncoprotein identified and paved the way to subsequent studies on the mechanism of oncogenic transformation./nIn 1979, Brugge took an assistant professor position at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Stony Brook, eventually becoming a Professor of Microbiology.

Often called a doyenne of Scottish literature, she wrote over 90 books of historical and science fiction, travel writing and autobiography.[1] Her husband Dick Mitchison's life peerage in 1964 entitled her to call herself Lady Mitchison, but she never did.[2][3] Her 1931 work, The Corn King and the Spring Queen, is seen by some as the prime 20th-century historical novel.[4]/nNaomi Mary Margaret Haldane was born in Edinburgh, the daughter and younger child of the physiologist John Scott Haldane and his wife (Louisa) Kathleen Trotter. Naomi's parents came from different political backgrounds, her father being a Liberal and her mother from a Conservative, pro-imperialist family. However, both were of landed stock; the Haldane family had been feudal barons of Gleneagles since the 13th century. Today the best-known member of the family is probably Naomi's elder brother, the biologist J. B. S. Haldane (1892\u20131964), but in her youth her paternal uncle Richard Burdon Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane, twice Lord Chancellor (from 1912 to 1915 under H. H. Asquith, and in 1924 during the first Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald), was better known./nNaomi followed her brother to the Oxford Preparatory School (later Dragon School) in 1904\u20131911, as the only girl there.[5] From 1911, she was tutored at home by a governess. She qualified for the University of Oxford in 1914, via the Oxford higher local examination and entered the Society of Oxford Home Students (later St Anne's College) to pursue a degree course in science. However, she chose before completing the course to become a nurse, as the First World War had broken out. After a course in first aid and home nursing in 1915, she joined a Voluntary Aid Detachment at St Thomas's Hospital, London. Her service was much curtailed after she caught scarlet fever.[2]/nThe Haldanes were known for their self-styled domestic experiments. She and her brother John started investigating Mendelian genetics in 1908. They initially used guinea pigs as experimental models, but changed to mice as they were more convenient to handle. Their findings were published as \"Reduplication in Mice\" in 1915. This was in fact the first demonstration of genetic linkage in mammals.[6]/nLike her father John Scott Haldane and elder brother J. B. S. Haldane, Naomi Haldane initially pursued a scientific career. From 1908, she and her brother looked into Mendelian genetics. Their 1915 publication was the first demonstration of genetic linkage in mammals.[6] However, whilst she was a diploma student at the Society of Oxford Home Students (later St Anne's College, Oxford), the outbreak of the First World War changed her interest to nursing./nMitchison was a prolific writer of more than 90 books in her lifetime, across a multitude of styles and genres. These include historical novels such as her first novel The Conquered (1923), set in Gaul in the 1st century BCE, during the Gallic Wars of Julius Caesar, and her second novel Cloud Cuckoo Land (1925) set in 5th-century BCE Ancient Greece during the Peloponnesian War. Her best work is thought to be The Corn King and the Spring Queen (1931), which treats three different societies, including a wholly fictional one, and explores themes of sexuality that were daring in her day. Terri Windling called it \"a lost classic\".[7] Literary critic Geoffrey Sadler stated of Mitchison's historical fiction: \"On the basis of her early writings, she is unquestionably one of the great historical novelists.\"[8]/nIn 1932, Mitchison was commissioned by Victor Gollancz to edit a guide to the modern world for children. Mitchison's book, An Outline for Boys and Girls and Their Parents, included several distinguished contributors, including W. H. Auden, Richard Hughes, Gerald Heard, and Olaf Stapledon.[9] On publication, An Outline was praised by The Times Literary Supplement, the New Statesman and the London Mercury.[9] However, several clergymen, including the Archbishop of York, were angered by the book's lack of emphasis on Christianity, while other right-wing authors objected to a perceived sympathy with the Soviet Union. The Conservative writer Arnold Lunn wrote a lengthy attack on the book in the English Review,[10] which contributed to its commercial failure.[9]/nUndoubtedly her most controversial work, We Have Been Warned, was published in 1935, based on a journey to the Soviet Union. In it she explored sexual behaviour, including rape and abortion.[1] The book was rejected by various publishers and ultimately censored.[11] She approached first her friend Victor Gollancz, who flatly turned her down, observing that \"publication of the book would cause a real outcry.\" The book was extensively rewritten to make it more acceptable to publishers, and was still subject to censorship. On publication it was universally despised for its depiction of rape, free love and abortion that \"alienated readers on the left and horrified those on the political right.\"[12] In 2005, files from the National Archives revealed that the British government had considered prosecuting the publishers of We Have Been Warned, but ultimately decided not to do so.[13]/nMitchison was a compulsive writer, as her travelogues revealed. She wrote on planes or in trains as prompted by the situation. For example, she wrote up a visit to the US in the 1930s, objecting to sharecropping./nHer 1938 book The Moral Basis of Politics was a treatise on ethics and politics that she had worked on for three years.[14] In it she defended the right of the left-wing journalist H. N. Brailsford to criticise the Moscow Trials, which had caused controversy on the British left at the time.[15]/nMitchison's The Blood of the Martyrs (1939) is set against the background of Nero's persecution of the Christians. She draws parallels between Nero and dictators of her own time, Mussolini and Hitler.[16]/nIn 1952, Mitchison went to Moscow as a member of the Authors' World Peace Appeal. She frequently visited Africa, especially Botswana, where she was made a sort of tribal mother (Mmarona) to the baKgatla people. Mucking Around (1981) best describes her haphazard travels in five continents over 50 years.[17]/nLater works included further historical novels: The Bull Calves (1947) about the Jacobite rising of 1745 and The Young Alexander the Great (1960). She also turned to fantasy, such as Graeme and the Dragon (1954, Graeme Mitchison being a grandson through Denis), science fiction such as Memoirs of a Spacewoman (1962) and Solution Three (1975), fantasy such as the humorous Arthurian novel To the Chapel Perilous (1955), non-fiction such as African Heroes (1968), and also children's novels, poetry, travel and a three-volume autobiography. She was unsure exactly how many books she had written, often claiming there were about 70. The articles were uncountable, from book reviews for the old Time and Tide magazine and the New Statesman to practical essays on farming, campaigning articles, recollections and reflections.[17]/nAfter her husband's death, Mitchison wrote several memoirs, published as separate titles between 1973 and 1985. She was also a good friend of the writer J. R. R. Tolkien, and one of the proof readers of The Lord of the Rings.[18] Maxim Lieber served as her literary editor in 1935./nMitchison, like her brother, was a committed socialist in the 1930s. She visited the Soviet Union in 1932 as part of a Fabian Society group and expressed some misgivings about the direction of Soviet society.[19] An active anti-fascist, Mitchison travelled to Austria, where she undertook the risky task of smuggling documents and left-wing refugees out of the country.[20][21] She stood unsuccessfully as a Labour Party candidate for the Scottish Universities in 1935, at a time when universities were still allowed to elect MPs. Eventually, as her political candidacy and her pro-Left writings had failed, she gradually became disenchanted with the Left. At that time, she became politically attracted to Scottish Nationalism and increasingly wrote on specifically Scottish issues and themes. Her name was on George Orwell's list of people, prepared in March 1949 for the Information Research Department set up at the Foreign Office by the Labour government, who were considered to have pro-communist leanings and so be inappropriate to write for the IRD.[22]/nMitchison's advocacy continued in other ways. She became a spokeswoman for the island communities of Scotland. She was a friend of Seretse Khama[3] and an advisor to the Bakgatla tribe of Botswana. Her keen interest in Scotland's problems led to her serving on Argyll County Council and the Highlands and Islands Development Council. Meanwhile she was a serious botanist, gardener and practical farmer.[23] She became a Labour representative on Argyll County Council from 1945 to 1966. She served on the Highland Panel in 1947\u20131965 and the Highlands and Islands Development Consultative Council in 1966\u20131976.[4][2]/nMitchison was a vocal campaigner for women's rights, advocating birth control, and was elected a Life Fellow of the Eugenics Society in 1925 before leaving in objection to the group's politics.[24] Her own lack of knowledge of birth control (as stated in her memoirs) led to an interest in the causes of birth control and abortion. She was on the founding council of North Kensington Women's Welfare Centre in London in 1924. Today, she is best known for her advocacy of feminism and her tackling of then-taboo subjects in her writing. She was a principal investor in the Partisan Coffee House, a meeting place for the New Left off Soho Square, which functioned in 1958\u20131962.[25]/nMitchison was present and supporting a Stop the Seventy Tour rally, aiming to halt the apartheid South African rugby and cricket tours of Britain in December 1969.[26]/nDick predeceased her in 1970, but Naomi remained active as a writer well into her nineties.[27] She was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1985 New Year Honours.[28] In her old age she was anxious and depressed about the future, particularly the misuse of scientific development such as nuclear arms. She stated that to experience two world wars in a lifetime was too much. On the other hand, she never exhausted the Haldanes' eccentricity, and once remarked in her biography in Who's Who that her recreation was \"burning rubbish\".[17]/nWhen asked on her 90th birthday whether she had regrets in life, she replied, \"Yes, all the men I never slept with. Imagine!\"[29]/nShe died at Carradale on 11 January 1999 at the age of 101, and was cremated at the Clydebank crematorium on 16 January. Her ashes were then scattered there.[30]/nMitchison's autobiography is in three parts:/nOn 11 February 1916, Naomi married the barrister Gilbert Richard Mitchison (23 March 1894 \u2013 14 February 1970), who was a close friend of her brother. Mitchison was then on leave from the Western Front; like her, he came from a well-connected and wealthy family. He became a Queen's Counsel, then a Labour politician, and eventually a life peer on 5 October 1964 as Baron Mitchison of Carradale in the County of Argyll, on retirement for his political work. Naomi thus became Lady Mitchison as the wife of a life peer, but she objected to the title. She played an active part in her husband's political career and in his constituency duties.[17]/nDick and Naomi Mitchison's marriage was not wholly satisfactory. After some years they both agreed to an open marriage, in which they entered into several other relationships that were conducted with dignity and described with humour. Her first serious lover was the Oxford classicist Theodore Wade-Gery, whose scholarship she drew on in writing her historical novels.[39] As described in her autobiography, You May Well Ask: A Memoir 1920\u20131940, she fell deeply in love with Wade-Gery. She wrote him love poems and missed him greatly after he broke off the relationship, considering it incompatible with his marriage to another woman in 1928. She mitigated her sorrow by undertaking a risky mission to help persecuted socialists in fascist-dominated Austria. Later she had several briefer, less intense affairs, in which the men were in love with her and she did her best to reciprocate. As she emphasized in describing these, she was careful to use contraceptives with her lovers and let her children be fathered by her husband alone \u2013 although she dreamed of a future in which her daughters would be able to \"have children by several chosen fathers, uncensured\".[40]/nNaomi and Dick had seven children. Their four sons were Geoffrey (1918\u20131927), who died of meningitis, Denis (1919\u20132018), a professor of bacteriology, Murdoch (1922\u20132011), and Avrion (1928\u20132022), both professors of zoology. Their three daughters were Lois (born 1926), Valentine (born 1928), and Clemency, who died in 1940, shortly after her birth./nBetween 1923 and 1939, they lived at Rivercourt House, Upper Mall, Hammersmith, London. They bought the Carradale House at Carradale in Kintyre in 1939, where they lived for the rest of their lives. The house was frequented by people of all sorts: lords, ladies, politicians, writers, neighbours, fishermen and farmers.[29] She and Denis MacIntosh, a local fisherman, wrote a documentary, Men and Herring: A Documentary, in 1949. Ten years later this was adapted for BBC Television as a docudrama, Spindrift.[41]", "60114207": "Madeline Lancaster is an American developmental biologist studying neurological development and diseases of the brain.

In 2000, she founded Genetrix,[3] a biotechnology company and in 2008 YSIOS, a venture capital firm, specialized in health and biotechnology. She was also a member of the board of the Spanish Confederation of Employers' Organizations (CEOE). After her term was over, Garmendia has taken up again her management side as member of YSIOS.[4]/nShe is a shareholder of Genetrix, and a member of scientific or advisory boards for many organizations, such as the Women for Africa Foundation.[5] and the Colombian Government's Productive Transformation Program International Advisory Board. She is also an active board member of a number of Spanish companies, branch organizations and a top business school./nGarmendia was born in 1962 in San Sebasti\u00e1n (Basque Country). At age 18 she studied biology at the University of Seville, where she graduated specializing in genetics. Subsequently, she moved to Madrid, where she has lived since the 1980s. In Madrid she combined her PhD in the CSIC from the Centro de Biolog\u00eda Molecular Severo Ochoa, and her experience as assistant professor in the department of genetics and molecular biology in the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid. She received her PhD from the Severo Ochoa Molecular Biology Center at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid under the guidance of Professor Margarita Salas. She completed her education with an Executive MBA program at IESE, University of Navarra./nAs a result of the MBA, Garmendia linked her Biology experience within the management activity. In 1992, as vice president and CFO, she was in charge on various responsibilities related to business development of Grupo Amasua, dedicated to the fishing industry. She held that position until 2001./nIn 2000 she founded Genetrix together with Carlos Mart\u00ednez and Antonio Bernad, Professors of the CSIC. Today Genetrix is involved in the development of biomedical technology and drugs. Genetrix was the first private firm that resulted from an investigation of the National Center of Biotechnology. Researchers of the department of immunology and oncology (DIO) of this center joined their research experience for this private initiative as a way to further develop their results of their investigations. The work of Garmendia was pioneer in that field as it helped lay the foundations in the Spanish biotechnology industry, transferring research outputs to the private sector. Garmendia has held positions of CEO, managing director of Genetrix, and in parallel, also promoted other business projects like Cellerix, Biotherapix, Sensia, Imbiosis, Biobide, BioAlma and Coretherapix.

The Ministry was created with the mandate to fully harness the economic potential the scientific capacity of the country \u2014Spain established itself as the 9th scientific power in 2010./nDuring her time as Minister, many ambitious programs were launched. One of them was The National Innovation Strategy or the Severo Ochoa, aimed to subsidize in an extraordinary way the best Spanish research centers. Another program passed during her time in office was the Law for Science, Technology and innovation which for the first time raised innovation to the level of law insisting on the mechanism of transfer knowledge between the public and private sectors. Although it contained reforms heavily demanded by the scientific community, like the creation of the Research State Agency and the replacement of a contract of employment instead of scholarship, the law received a lot of criticism from some scientists.[7] In terms of public investment in R&D, 2008- 2009 were years of growth with high increases in budgets, while the period between 2010 and 2011 were years of reduction and budget freeze with consequent criticism from the scientific community. In terms of great infrastructures, during term of office of Mrs. Garmendia new infrastructures where inaugurated \u2014the Gran Telescopio Canarias (a 10.4m telescope with a segmented primary mirror in the island of La Palma), the Spanish National Center of Human Evolution (Burgos) and the Synchrotron Light Source in Cerdanyola del Vall\u00e8s.[8] The Minister of Science and Innovation was the first and only political role of Cristina Garmendia, who is not a member the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party.

She studied at the University of Munich under the direction of Karl Von Frisch and is known for her research on the time sense of honey bees.[1][2]\nIn her research, in 1929, she trained bees to come to a feeding station at a specific time of day, day after day.[3][4] This contribution ultimately led to the discovery of the bees\u2019 24-hour biological clock. Because of this achievement, she was regarded as one of the first female chronobiologists.  Beyond honeybees, much of Beling's work involved studying behaviors of wasps,[5] fly pupae,[6] etc. Finally, she also did some research in pest control.[7][8]/nBeling wrote in her widely cited 1929 paper, titled \"\u00dcber das Zeitged\u00e4chtnis der Bienen\"  (\u201cOn the Time Memory of Bees\u201d) published in the Journal of Comparative Physiology, that the early observations of Forel, v. Buttel-Reepen and Dobkiewicz promoted her to study the intriguing behavior of bees, termed Zeitged\u00e4chtnis, or time memory.[3][9]  In her pioneer experiments, Beling trained a group of individually marked foraging bees to fly to a feeding dish, which was filled with sugar water only at certain times of the day (for example, between 4 and 6 PM). During the testing phase, the dish was empty throughout the day and every visiting bee was recorded. She found that the bees only visited the feeding station at trained time, even when the sugar water was removed. Specifically, Beling found that the bees can anticipate the food by showing up just a little early every morning. Further more, she found that bees could be trained to show up at the feeding station at any time of the day, and even for multiple times a day. However, Beling did report that the bees could only be trained to a period close to 24 hours, but not 19 or 48 hours as she tested. These results were still present when Beling controlled potential environmental cues such as humidity, temperature, light and radiation./nBeling was able to show that bees have an astonishing memory of time. She found that this time memory is both rigorous (the bees consistently show up at the expected time) and flexible (the bees can be trained to show up any time of night or day, even two or three times a day). Beling found that bees could only train to periods close to 24 hours. This 24-hour rhythm in bees has biological significance in that it is evolutionarily advantageous, helping the bees coordinate with flowers when they are gathering nectar and helping them avoid flying at dangerous predator-filled times of day.[10] The bees' anticipation of the feeding is also advantageous - by knowing the time of day, the bees can prepare themselves for the meal and enable a faster response.[11]  Beling's research was unable to conclusively show whether bees have some kind of internal biological clock that is controlling this behavior or if there is some external cue acting as a Zeitgeber that she did not account for in her experiments./nMuch of the early work in chronobiology was done in Germany, so publications were largely written in German. Some terms created at this time are still being used or often referred to today. The father of chronobiology, Colin Pittendrigh, critiqued these terms, saying that researchers in Munich have trouble letting go of these terms. He argues that \u2018training\u2019 and \u2018memory\u2019 do not capture the innate components of the behavior.[12]/nBeling was one of the earliest chronobiologists who studied the rhythms of bees. Her work grew from the observations of previous scientists (Forel, Buttel-Reepen, von Frisch) and helped inspire further experimentation (Wahl, Renner). Standing on the shoulders of these researchers, Pittendrigh took the field of chronobiology to the modern era by studying biological clocks in fruit flies and is regarded as the father of modern chronobiology.", "607547": "Friedrich Hermann Otto Finsch (8 August 1839, Warmbrunn \u2013 31 January 1917, Braunschweig) was a German ethnographer, naturalist and colonial explorer. He is known for a two-volume monograph on the parrots of the world which earned him a doctorate. He also wrote on the people of New Guinea and was involved in plans for German colonization in Southeast Asia. Several species of bird (such as Oenanthe finschii, Iole finschii, Psittacula finschii) are named after him as also the town of Finschhafen in Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea and a crater on the Moon./nFinsch was born at Bad Warmbrunn in Silesia to Mortiz Finsch and Mathilde n\u00e9e Leder. His father was in the glass trade and he too trained as a glass painter. An interest in birds led him to use his artistic skills for the purpose. Finsch went to Budapest in 1857 and studied at the Royal Hungarian University, earning money by preparing natural history specimens. He then spent two years in Russe, Bulgaria on an invitation from the Austrian Consul and gave private tutoring in German while exploring the birdlife of the region. He published his first paper in the Journal fur Ornithologie on the birds of Bulgaria. This experience helped him obtain a curatorial position at the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie in Leiden (1862\u20131865) assisting Herman Schlegel. In 1864 he returned to Germany on the suggestion of Gustav Hartlaub to become curator of the museum in Bremen and became its director in 1876. After publishing the two volume monographs on the parrots of the world, Die Papageien, monographisch bearbeitet (1867\u201368), he obtained an honorary doctorate from the Friedrich Wilhelms University in Bonn. Apart from ornithology he also took an interest in ethnology.[1] In 1876 he accompanied the zoologist Alfred Brehm on an expedition to Turkestan and northwest China.[2][3]/nFinsch resigned as curator of the museum in 1878 in order that he could resume his travels, sponsored by the Humboldt Foundation. Between spring 1879 and 1885 he made several visits to the Polynesian Islands, New Zealand, Australia and New Guinea. His proposal was to obtain as many artefacts as possible with the claim that native cultures, fauna and flora were fast vanishing.[2] Finsch was shocked by the punitive actions of the English Methodist missionary George Brown (1835-1917) and was concerned by the violent conflicts between the natives and westerners. He also found no support for contemporary ideas on race with neat categories and found instead a continuum of variations in the human form. After witnessing a cannibal feast at Matupit he commented that the people were still not classifiable as \"savages\" as they maintained neat agriculture, had their own song, dance and followed commerce.[4] He returned to Germany in 1882[5] and began to promote the creation of German colonies in the Pacific along with the South Sea Plotters, an influential group led by a banker Adolph von Hansemann. In 1884 he returned aboard the steamer Samoa to New Guinea as Bismarck's Imperial Commissioner to explore potential harbours under the guise of scientists and negotiated for the north-eastern portion of that island, together with New Britain and New Ireland, to become a German protectorate.[1] It was renamed Kaiser-Wilhelmsland and the Bismarck Archipelago. The capital of the colony was named Finschhafen in his honour. In 1885 he was the first European to discover the Sepik river, and he named it after Kaiserin Augusta, the German Empress. Newspapers of the period speculated that he would be appointed as an administrator to the new territories but this never happened. He was instead offered a position as station director which involved menial administrative tasks that would come in the way of his plans to explore and study the region. He returned to Germany and spent much of the subsequent period without formal employment. Finsch had been married to Josephine Wychodil from around 1873 but they divorced around 1880. In 1886 he married Elisabeth n\u00e9e Hoffman (1860\u20131925). Elisabeth was a talented artist and she illustrated many of his catalogues. Finsch was briefly an advisor to the Neuguinea-Kompagnie. In 1898 he abandoned his dreams in ethnology and returned to ornithology, becoming curator of the bird collections at the Rijksmuseum in Leiden. He did not enjoy this period, noting that life for him, his wife and daughter Esther, felt like living in exile. He also wrote several articles on his past work Wie ich Kaiser-Wilhelmsland erwarb (How I acquired Kaiser Wilhelm\u2019s Land, 1902) and Kaiser-Wilhelmsland. Eine friedliche Kolonialerwerbung (Kaiser Wilhelm\u2019s Land: A peaceful colonial acquisition, 1905). Seeking return to Germany, he finally joined the ethnographical department of the Municipal Museum in Brunswick in 1904 and worked the remainder of his life there.[3] In 1909 he was titled professor by the Duke of Braunschweig and honoured with a 'medal for distinguished services for art and science' in silver.[2]/nOne of his major works was on the parrots of the world. This was not without its critics, since he often tried to rename genera  apparently to gain taxonomic authorship.[6]/nSeveral species of birds bear his name, including the lilac-crowned parrot (Amazona finschi), Finsch's wheatear (Oenanthe finschii), Finsch's bulbul (Alophoixus finschii), and the grey-headed parakeet (Psittacula finschii). A species of monitor lizard, Varanus finschi, is named after him,[7] because he collected what would become the holotype for this species. The crater Finsch on the Moon is also named in his honor./nIn 2008, following international treaties, some of the human remains that he had collected from Cape York and the Torres Straits that were held in the Charit\u00e9 Medical University in Berlin were repatriated.[3] Additional remains have also been repatriated.[8]", "61392188": "Elvira Cuevas Viera is a Puerto Rican ecologist.

His research in chemistry led to remarkable breakthroughs in the understanding of the causes and preventions of diseases, which laid down the foundations of hygiene, public health and much of modern medicine.[5] Pasteur's works are credited with saving millions of lives through the developments of vaccines for rabies and anthrax. He is regarded as one of the founders of modern bacteriology and has been honored as the \"father of bacteriology\"[6] and the \"father of microbiology\"[7][8] (together with Robert Koch;[9][10] the latter epithet also attributed to Antonie van Leeuwenhoek).[11]/nPasteur was responsible for disproving the doctrine of spontaneous generation. Under the auspices of the French Academy of Sciences, his experiment demonstrated that in sterilized and sealed flasks, nothing ever developed; conversely, in sterilized but open flasks, microorganisms could grow.[12] For this experiment, the academy awarded him the Alhumbert Prize carrying 2,500 francs in 1862./nPasteur is also regarded as one of the fathers of germ theory of diseases, which was a minor medical concept at the time.[13] His many experiments showed that diseases could be prevented by killing or stopping germs, thereby directly supporting the germ theory and its application in clinical medicine. He is best known to the general public for his invention of the technique of treating milk and wine to stop bacterial contamination, a process now called pasteurization. Pasteur also made significant discoveries in chemistry, most notably on the molecular basis for the asymmetry of certain crystals and racemization. Early in his career, his investigation of sodium ammonium tartrate initiated the field of optical isomerism. This work had a profound effect on structural chemistry, with eventual implications for many areas including medicinal chemistry./nHe was the director of the Pasteur Institute, established in 1887, until his death, and his body was interred in a vault beneath the institute. Although Pasteur made groundbreaking experiments, his reputation became associated with various controversies. Historical reassessment of his notebook revealed that he practiced deception to overcome his rivals.[14][15]/nLouis Pasteur was born on 27 December 1822, in Dole, Jura, France, to a Catholic family of a poor tanner.[16] He was the third child of Jean-Joseph Pasteur and Jeanne-Etiennette Roqui. The family moved to Marnoz in 1826 and then to Arbois in 1827.[17][18] Pasteur entered primary school in 1831.[19] He was dyslexic and dysgraphic.[20][21][22]/nHe was an average student in his early years, and not particularly academic, as his interests were fishing and sketching.[16] He drew many pastels and portraits of his parents, friends and neighbors.[23] Pasteur attended secondary school at the Coll\u00e8ge d'Arbois.[24] In October 1838, he left for Paris to enroll in a boarding school, but became homesick and returned in November.[25]/nIn 1839, he entered the Coll\u00e8ge Royal at Besan\u00e7on to study philosophy and earned his Bachelor of Letters degree in 1840.[26] He was appointed a tutor at the Besan\u00e7on college while continuing a degree science course with special mathematics.[27] He failed his first examination in 1841. He managed to pass the baccalaur\u00e9at scientifique (general science) degree from Dijon, where he earned his Bachelor of Science in Mathematics degree (Bachelier \u00e8s Sciences Math\u00e9matiques) in 1842,[28] but with a mediocre grade in chemistry.[29]/nLater in 1842, Pasteur took the entrance test for the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure.[30] He passed the first set of tests, but because his ranking was low, Pasteur decided not to continue and try again next year.[31] He went back to the Parisian boarding school to prepare for the test. He also attended classes at the Lyc\u00e9e Saint-Louis and lectures of Jean-Baptiste Dumas at the Sorbonne.[32] In 1843, he passed the test with a high ranking and entered the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure.[33] In 1845 he received the licenci\u00e9 \u00e8s sciences degree.[34] In 1846, he was appointed professor of physics at the Coll\u00e8ge de Tournon (now called Lyc\u00e9e Gabriel-Faure) in Ard\u00e8che. But the chemist Antoine J\u00e9r\u00f4me Balard wanted him back at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure as a graduate laboratory assistant (agr\u00e9g\u00e9 pr\u00e9parateur).[35] He joined Balard and simultaneously started his research in crystallography and in 1847, he submitted his two theses, one in chemistry and the other in physics: (a) Chemistry Thesis: \"Recherches sur la capacit\u00e9 de saturation de l'acide ars\u00e9nieux. Etudes des ars\u00e9nites de potasse, de soude et d'ammoniaque.\"; (b) Physics Thesis: \"1. \u00c9tudes des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes relatifs \u00e0 la polarisation rotatoire des liquides. 2. Application de la polarisation rotatoire des liquides \u00e0 la solution de diverses questions de chimie.\"[36][34][37]/nAfter serving briefly as professor of physics at the Dijon Lyc\u00e9e in 1848, he became professor of chemistry at the University of Strasbourg,[38] where he met and courted Marie Laurent, daughter of the university's rector in 1849. They were married on 29 May 1849,[39] and together had five children, only two of whom survived to adulthood;[40] the other three died of typhoid./nPasteur was appointed professor of chemistry at the University of Strasbourg in 1848, and became the chair of chemistry in 1852.[41]/nIn February 1854, so that he would have time to carry out work that could earn him the title of correspondent of the Institute, he got three months' paid leave with the help of a medical certificate of convenience.[42] He extended the leave until 1 August, the date of the start of the exams. \"I tell the Minister that I will go and do the examinations so as not to increase the embarrassment of the service. It is also so as not to leave to another a sum of 6 or 700 francs\".[43]/nIn this same year 1854, he was named dean of the new faculty of sciences at University of Lille, where he began his studies on fermentation.[44] It was on this occasion that Pasteur uttered his oft-quoted remark: \"dans les champs de l'observation, le hasard ne favorise que les esprits pr\u00e9par\u00e9s\" (\"In the field of observation, chance favors only the prepared mind\").[45]/nIn 1857, he moved to Paris as the director of scientific studies at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure where he took control from 1858 to 1867 and introduced a series of reforms to improve the standard of scientific work. The examinations became more rigid, which led to better results, greater competition, and increased prestige. Many of his decrees, however, were rigid and authoritarian, leading to two serious student revolts. During \"the bean revolt\" he decreed that a mutton stew, which students had refused to eat, would be served and eaten every Monday. On another occasion he threatened to expel any student caught smoking, and 73 of the 80 students in the school resigned.[46]/nIn 1863, he was appointed professor of geology, physics, and chemistry at the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts, a position he held until his resignation in 1867. In 1867, he became the chair of organic chemistry at the Sorbonne,[47] but he later gave up the position because of poor health.[48] In 1867, the \u00c9cole Normale's laboratory of physiological chemistry was created at Pasteur's request,[47] and he was the laboratory's director from 1867 to 1888.[49] In Paris, he established the Pasteur Institute in 1887, in which he was its director for the rest of his life.[7][50]/nIn Pasteur's early work as a chemist, beginning at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, and continuing at Strasbourg and Lille, he examined the chemical, optical and crystallographic properties of a group of compounds known as tartrates.[51]/nHe resolved a problem concerning the nature of tartaric acid in 1848.[52][53][54][55] A solution of this compound derived from living things rotated the plane of polarization of light passing through it.[51] The problem was that tartaric acid derived by chemical synthesis had no such effect, even though its chemical reactions were identical and its elemental composition was the same.[56]/nPasteur noticed that crystals of tartrates had small faces. Then he observed that, in racemic mixtures of tartrates, half of the crystals were right-handed and half were left-handed. In solution, the right-handed compound was dextrorotatory, and the left-handed one was levorotatory.[51] Pasteur determined that optical activity related to the shape of the crystals, and that an asymmetric internal arrangement of the molecules of the compound was responsible for twisting the light.[44] The (2R,3R)- and (2S,3S)- tartrates were isometric, non-superposable mirror images of each other. This was the first time anyone had demonstrated molecular chirality, and also the first explanation of isomerism.[51]/nSome historians consider Pasteur's work in this area to be his \"most profound and most original contributions to science\", and his \"greatest scientific discovery.\"[51]/nPasteur was motivated to investigate fermentation while working at Lille. In 1856 a local wine manufacturer, M. Bigot, whose son was one of Pasteur's students, sought for his advice on the problems of making beetroot alcohol and souring.[57][5] Pasteur began his research in the topic by repeating and confirming works of Theodor Schwann, who demonstrated a decade earlier that yeast were alive./nAccording to his son-in-law, Ren\u00e9 Vallery-Radot, in August 1857 Pasteur sent a paper about lactic acid fermentation to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Sciences de Lille, but the paper was read three months later.[58] A memoire was subsequently published on 30 November 1857.[59] In the memoir, he developed his ideas stating that: \"I intend to establish that, just as there is an alcoholic ferment, the yeast of beer, which is found everywhere that sugar is decomposed into alcohol and carbonic acid, so also there is a particular ferment, a lactic yeast, always present when sugar becomes lactic acid.\"[60]/nPasteur also wrote about alcoholic fermentation.[61] It was published in full form in 1858.[62][63] J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius and Justus von Liebig had proposed the theory that fermentation was caused by decomposition. Pasteur demonstrated that this theory was incorrect, and that yeast was responsible for fermentation to produce alcohol from sugar.[64] He also demonstrated that, when a different microorganism contaminated the wine, lactic acid was produced, making the wine sour.[5] In 1861, Pasteur observed that less sugar fermented per part of yeast when the yeast was exposed to air.[64] The lower rate of fermentation aerobically became known as the Pasteur effect.[65]/nPasteur's research also showed that the growth of micro-organisms was responsible for spoiling beverages, such as beer, wine and milk. With this established, he invented a process in which liquids such as milk were heated to a temperature between 60 and 100\u00a0\u00b0C.[66] This killed most bacteria and moulds already present within them. Pasteur and Claude Bernard completed tests on blood and urine on 20 April 1862.[67] Pasteur patented the process, to fight the \"diseases\" of wine, in 1865.[66] The method became known as pasteurization, and was soon applied to beer and milk.[68]/nBeverage contamination led Pasteur to the idea that micro-organisms infecting animals and humans cause disease. He proposed preventing the entry of micro-organisms into the human body, leading Joseph Lister to develop antiseptic methods in surgery.[69]/nIn 1866, Pasteur published Etudes sur le Vin, about the diseases of wine, and he published Etudes sur la Bi\u00e8re in 1876, concerning the diseases of beer.[64]/nIn the early 19th century, Agostino Bassi had shown that muscardine was caused by a fungus that infected silkworms.[70] Since 1853, two diseases called p\u00e9brine and flacherie had been infecting great numbers of silkworms in southern France, and by 1865 they were causing huge losses to farmers. In 1865, Pasteur went to Al\u00e8s and worked for five years until 1870.[71][72]/nSilkworms with p\u00e9brine were covered in corpuscles. In the first three years, Pasteur thought that the corpuscles were a symptom of the disease. In 1870, he concluded that the corpuscles were the cause of p\u00e9brine (it is now known that the cause is a microsporidian).[70] Pasteur also showed that the disease was hereditary.[73] Pasteur developed a system to prevent p\u00e9brine: after the female moths laid their eggs, the moths were turned into a pulp. The pulp was examined with a microscope, and if corpuscles were observed, the eggs were destroyed.[74][73] Pasteur concluded that bacteria caused flacherie. The primary cause is currently thought to be viruses.[70] The spread of flacherie could be accidental or hereditary. Hygiene could be used to prevent accidental flacherie. Moths whose digestive cavities did not contain the microorganisms causing flacherie were used to lay eggs, preventing hereditary flacherie.[75]/nFollowing his fermentation experiments, Pasteur demonstrated that the skin of grapes was the natural source of yeasts, and that sterilized grapes and grape juice never fermented. He drew grape juice from under the skin with sterilized needles, and also covered grapes with sterilized cloth. Both experiments could not produce wine in sterilized containers.[5]/nHis findings and ideas were against the prevailing notion of spontaneous generation. He received a particularly stern criticism from F\u00e9lix Archim\u00e8de Pouchet, who was director of the Rouen Museum of Natural History. To settle the debate between the eminent scientists, the French Academy of Sciences offered the Alhumbert Prize carrying 2,500 francs to whoever could experimentally demonstrate for or against the doctrine.[76][77][78]/nPouchet stated that air everywhere could cause spontaneous generation of living organisms in liquids.[79] In the late 1850s, he performed experiments and claimed that they were evidence of spontaneous generation.[80][76] Francesco Redi and Lazzaro Spallanzani had provided some evidence against spontaneous generation in the 17th and 18th centuries, respectively. Spallanzani's experiments in 1765 suggested that air contaminated broths with bacteria. In the 1860s, Pasteur repeated Spallanzani's experiments, but Pouchet reported a different result using a different broth.[71]/nPasteur performed several experiments to disprove spontaneous generation. He placed boiled liquid in a flask and let hot air enter the flask. Then he closed the flask, and no organisms grew in it.[80] In another experiment, when he opened flasks containing boiled liquid, dust entered the flasks, causing organisms to grow in some of them. The number of flasks in which organisms grew was lower at higher altitudes, showing that air at high altitudes contained less dust and fewer organisms.[5][81] Pasteur also used swan neck flasks containing a fermentable liquid. Air was allowed to enter the flask via a long curving tube that made dust particles stick to it. Nothing grew in the broths unless the flasks were tilted, making the liquid touch the contaminated walls of the neck. This showed that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, on dust, rather than spontaneously generating within the liquid or from the action of pure air.[5][82]/nThese were some of the most important experiments disproving the theory of spontaneous generation. Pasteur gave a series of five presentations of his findings before the French Academy of Sciences in 1881, which were published in 1882 as M\u00e9moire Sur les corpuscules organis\u00e9s qui existent dans l'atmosph\u00e8re: Examen de la doctrine des g\u00e9n\u00e9rations spontan\u00e9es (Account of Organized Corpuscles Existing in the Atmosphere: Examining the Doctrine of Spontaneous Generation).[83][84] Pasteur won the Alhumbert Prize in 1862.[80] He concluded that:/nNever will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow of this simple experiment. There is no known circumstance in which it can be confirmed that microscopic beings came into the world without germs, without parents similar to themselves.[5][72]/nIn 1865, Jean-Baptiste Dumas, chemist, senator and former Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, asked Pasteur to study a new disease that was decimating silkworm farms from the south of France and Europe, the p\u00e9brine, characterized on a macroscopic scale by black spots and on a microscopic scale by the \"Cornalia corpuscles\". Pasteur accepted and made five long stays in Al\u00e8s, between 7 June 1865 and 1869.[85]/nArriving in Al\u00e8s, Pasteur familiarized himself with p\u00e9brine and also[86] with another disease of the silkworm, known earlier[87] than pebrine: flacherie or dead-flat disease. Contrary, for example, to Quatrefages, who coined the new word p\u00e9brine,[88] Pasteur made the mistake of believing that the two diseases were the same and even that most of the diseases of silkworms known up to that time were identical with each other and with p\u00e9brine.[89] It was in letters of 30 April and 21 May 1867 to Dumas that he first made the distinction between p\u00e9brine and flacherie.[90]/nHe made another mistake: he began by denying the \"parasitic\" (microbial) nature of p\u00e9brine, which several scholars (notably Antoine B\u00e9champ)[91] considered well established. Even a note published on 27 August 1866 by Balbiani,[92] which Pasteur at first seemed to welcome favourably[93] had no effect, at least immediately.[94] \"Pasteur is mistaken. He would only change his mind in the course of 1867\".[95]/nAt a time where Pasteur had not yet understood the cause of the p\u00e9brine, he propagated an effective process to stop infections: a sample of chrysalises was chosen, they were crushed and the corpuscles were searched for in the crushed material; if the proportion of corpuscular pupae in the sample was very low, the chamber was considered good for reproduction.[96] This method of sorting \"seeds\" (eggs) is close to a method that Osimo had proposed a few years earlier, but whose trials had not been conclusive.[97] By this process, Pasteur curbs p\u00e9brine and saves many of the silk industry in the C\u00e9vennes.[98][99]/nIn 1878, at the Congr\u00e8s international s\u00e9ricicole, Pasteur admitted that \"if p\u00e9brine is overcome, flacherie still exerts its ravages\". He attributed the persistence of flacherie to the fact that the farmers had not followed his advice.[100]/nIn 1884, Balbiani,[101] who disregarded the theoretical value of Pasteur's work on silkworm diseases, acknowledged that his practical process had remedied the ravages of p\u00e9brine, but added that this result tended to be counterbalanced by the development of flacherie, which was less well known and more difficult to prevent./nDespite Pasteur's success against p\u00e9brine, French sericulture had not been saved from damage. (See fr:S\u00e9riciculture in the French Wikipedia.)/nPasteur's first work on vaccine development was on chicken cholera. He received the bacteria samples (later called Pasteurella multocida after him) from Henry Toussaint.[102] He started the study in 1877, and by the next year, was able to maintain a stable culture using broths.[103] After another year of continuous culturing, he found that the bacteria were less pathogenic. Some of his culture samples could no longer induce the disease in healthy chickens. In 1879, Pasteur, planning for holiday, instructed his assistant, Charles Chamberland to inoculate the chickens with fresh bacteria culture. Chamberland forgot and went on holiday himself. On his return, he injected the month-old cultures to healthy chickens. The chickens showed some symptoms of infection, but instead of the infections being fatal, as they usually were, the chickens recovered completely. Chamberland assumed an error had been made, and wanted to discard the apparently faulty culture, but Pasteur stopped him.[104][105] Pasteur injected the freshly recovered chickens with fresh bacteria that normally would kill other chickens; the chickens no longer showed any sign of infection. It was clear to him that the weakened bacteria had caused the chickens to become immune to the disease.[103][106]/nIn December 1880, Pasteur presented his results to the French Academy of Sciences as \"Sur les maladies virulentes et en particulier sur la maladie appel\u00e9e vulgairement chol\u00e9ra des poules (On virulent diseases, and in particular on the disease commonly called chicken cholera)\" and published it in the academy's journal (Comptes-Rendus hebdomadaires des s\u00e9ances de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences). He attributed that the bacteria were weakened by contact with oxygen.[102] He explained that bacteria kept in sealed containers never lost their virulence, and only those exposed to air in culture media could be used as vaccine. Pasteur introduced the term \"attenuation\" for this weakening of virulence as he presented before the academy, saying:/nWe can diminish the microbe's virulence by changing the mode of culturing. This is the crucial point of my subject. I ask the Academy not to criticize, for the time being, the confidence of my proceedings that permit me to determine the microbe's attenuation, in order to save the independence of my studies and to better assure their progress... [In conclusion] I would like to point out to the Academy two main consequences to the facts presented: the hope to culture all microbes and to find a vaccine for all infectious diseases that have repeatedly afflicted humanity, and are a major burden on agriculture and breeding of domestic animals.[107]/nIn fact, Pasteur's vaccine against chicken cholera was not regular in its effects and was a failure.[108]/nIn the 1870s, he applied this immunization method to anthrax, which affected cattle, and aroused interest in combating other diseases. Pasteur cultivated bacteria from the blood of animals infected with anthrax. When he inoculated animals with the bacteria, anthrax occurred, proving that the bacteria was the cause of the disease.[109] Many cattle were dying of anthrax in \"cursed fields\".[72] Pasteur was told that sheep that died from anthrax were buried in the field. Pasteur thought that earthworms might have brought the bacteria to the surface. He found anthrax bacteria in earthworms' excrement, showing that he was correct.[72] He told the farmers not to bury dead animals in the fields.[110] Pasteur had been trying to develop the anthrax vaccine since 1877, soon after Robert Koch's discovery of the bacterium.[107]/nOn 12 July 1880, Henri Bouley read before the French Academy of Sciences a report from Henry Toussaint, a veterinary surgeon, who was not member of the academy. Toussaint had developed anthrax vaccine by killing the bacilli by heating at 55\u00a0\u00b0C for 10 \u2009minutes. He tested on eight dogs and 11 sheep, half of which died after inoculation. It was not a great success. Upon hearing the news, Pasteur immediately wrote to the academy that he could not believe that dead vaccine would work and that Toussaint's claim \"overturns all the ideas I had on viruses, vaccines, etc.\"[107] Following Pasteur's criticism, Toussaint switched to carbolic acid to kill anthrax bacilli and tested the vaccine on sheep in August 1880. Pasteur thought that this type of killed vaccine should not work because he believed that attenuated bacteria used up nutrients that the bacteria needed to grow. He thought oxidizing bacteria made them less virulent.[111]/nBut Pasteur found that anthrax bacillus was not easily weakened by culturing in air as it formed spores \u2013 unlike chicken cholera bacillus. In early 1881, he discovered that growing anthrax bacilli at about 42\u00a0\u00b0C made them unable to produce spores,[112] and he described this method in a speech to the French Academy of Sciences on 28 February.[113] On 21 March, he announced successful vaccination of sheep. To this news, veterinarian Hippolyte Rossignol proposed that the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'agriculture de Melun organize an experiment to test Pasteur's vaccine.  Pasteur signed agreement of the challenge on 28 April. A public experiment was conducted in May at Pouilly-le-Fort. 58 sheep, 2 goats and 10 cattle were used, half of which were given the vaccine on 5 and 17 May; while the other half was untreated.[114] All the animals were injected with the fresh virulent culture of anthrax bacillus on 31 May. The official result was observed and analysed on 2 June in the presence of over 200 spectators. All cattle survived, vaccinated or not. Pasteur had bravely predicted: \"I hypothesized that the six vaccinated cows would not become very ill, while the four unvaccinated cows would perish or at least become very ill.\"[114] However, all vaccinated sheep and goats survived, while unvaccinated ones had died or were dying before the viewers.[115] His report to the French Academy of Sciences on 13 June concludes:/n[By] looking at everything from the scientific point of view, the development of a vaccination against anthrax constitutes significant progress beyond the first vaccine developed by Jenner, since the latter had never been obtained experimentally.[114]/nPasteur did not directly disclose how he prepared the vaccines used at Pouilly-le-Fort.[116][112] Although his report indicated it as a \"live vaccine\",[114] his laboratory notebooks show that he actually used potassium dichromate-killed vaccine, as developed by Chamberland, quite similar to Toussaint's method.[117][56][118]/nThe notion of a weak form of a disease causing immunity to the virulent version was not new; this had been known for a long time for smallpox. Inoculation with smallpox (variolation) was known to result in a much less severe disease, and greatly reduced mortality, in comparison with the naturally acquired disease.[119] Edward Jenner had also studied vaccination using cowpox (vaccinia) to give cross-immunity to smallpox in the late 1790s, and by the early 1800s vaccination had spread to most of Europe.[120]/nThe difference between smallpox vaccination and anthrax or chicken cholera vaccination was that the latter two disease organisms had been artificially weakened, so a naturally weak form of the disease organism did not need to be found.[117] This discovery revolutionized work in infectious diseases, and Pasteur gave these artificially weakened diseases the generic name of \"vaccines\", in honour of Jenner's discovery.[121]/nIn 1876, Robert Koch had shown that Bacillus anthracis caused anthrax.[122] In his papers published between 1878 and 1880, Pasteur only mentioned Koch's work in a footnote. Koch met Pasteur at the Seventh International Medical Congress in 1881. A few months later, Koch wrote that Pasteur had used impure cultures and made errors. In 1882, Pasteur replied to Koch in a speech, to which Koch responded aggressively.[13] Koch stated that Pasteur tested his vaccine on unsuitable animals and that Pasteur's research was not properly scientific.[5] In 1882, Koch wrote \"On the Anthrax Inoculation\", in which he refuted several of Pasteur's conclusions about anthrax and criticized Pasteur for keeping his methods secret, jumping to conclusions, and being imprecise. In 1883, Pasteur wrote that he used cultures prepared in a similar way to his successful fermentation experiments and that Koch misinterpreted statistics and ignored Pasteur's work on silkworms.[122]/nIn 1882, Pasteur sent his assistant Louis Thuillier to southern France because of an epizootic of swine erysipelas.[123] Thuillier identified the bacillus that caused the disease in March 1883.[71] Pasteur and Thuillier increased the bacillus's virulence after passing it through pigeons. Then they passed the bacillus through rabbits, weakening it and obtaining a vaccine. Pasteur and Thuillier incorrectly described the bacterium as a figure-eight shape. Roux described the bacterium as stick-shaped in 1884.[124]/nPasteur produced the first vaccine for rabies by growing the virus in rabbits, and then weakening it by drying the affected nerve tissue.[72][125] The rabies vaccine was initially created by Emile Roux, a French doctor and a colleague of Pasteur, who had produced a killed vaccine using this method.[5] The vaccine had been tested in 50 dogs before its first human trial.[126][127] This vaccine was used on 9-year-old Joseph Meister, on 6 July 1885, after the boy was badly mauled by a rabid dog.[56][125] This was done at some personal risk for Pasteur, since he was not a licensed physician and could have faced prosecution for treating the boy.[50] After consulting with physicians, he decided to go ahead with the treatment.[128] Over 11 days, Meister received 13 inoculations, each inoculation using viruses that had been weakened for a shorter period of time.[129] Three months later he examined Meister and found that he was in good health.[128][130] Pasteur was hailed as a hero and the legal matter was not pursued.[50] Analysis of his laboratory notebooks shows that Pasteur had treated two people before his vaccination of Meister. One survived but may not actually have had rabies, and the other died of rabies.[129][131] Pasteur began treatment of Jean-Baptiste Jupille on 20 October 1885, and the treatment was successful.[129] Later in 1885, people, including four children from the United States, went to Pasteur's laboratory to be inoculated.[128] In 1886, he treated 350 people, of which only one developed rabies.[129] The treatment's success laid the foundations for the manufacture of many other vaccines. The first of the Pasteur Institutes was also built on the basis of this achievement.[56]/nIn The Story of San Michele, Axel Munthe writes of some risks Pasteur undertook in the rabies vaccine research:[132]/nPasteur himself was absolutely fearless. Anxious to secure a sample of saliva straight from the jaws of a rabid dog, I once saw him with the glass tube held between his lips draw a few drops of the deadly saliva from the mouth of a rabid bull-dog, held on the table by two assistants, their hands protected by leather gloves./nBecause of his study in germs, Pasteur encouraged doctors to sanitize their hands and equipment before surgery. Prior to this, few doctors or their assistants practiced these procedures.[133][134] Ignaz Semmelweis and Joseph Lister had earlier practiced hand sanitizing in medical contexts in the 1860s.[135][136]/nA French national hero at age 55, in 1878 Pasteur discreetly told his family to never reveal his laboratory notebooks to anyone. His family obeyed, and all his documents were held and inherited in secrecy. Finally, in 1964 Pasteur's grandson and last surviving male descendant, Pasteur Vallery-Radot, donated the papers to the French national library. Yet the papers were restricted for historical studies until the death of Vallery-Radot in 1971. The documents were given a catalogue number only in 1985.[137]/nIn 1995, the centennial of the death of Louis Pasteur, a historian of science Gerald L. Geison published an analysis of Pasteur's private notebooks in his The Private Science of Louis Pasteur, and declared that Pasteur had given several misleading accounts and played deceptions in his most important discoveries.[14][138] Max Perutz published a defense of Pasteur in The New York Review of Books.[139] Based on further examinations of Pasteur's documents, French immunologist Patrice Debr\u00e9 concluded in his book Louis Pasteur (1998) that, in spite of his genius, Pasteur had some faults. A book review states that Debr\u00e9 \"sometimes finds him unfair, combative, arrogant, unattractive in attitude, inflexible and even dogmatic\".[140][141]/nScientists before Pasteur had studied fermentation. In the 1830s, Charles Cagniard-Latour, Friedrich Traugott K\u00fctzing and Theodor Schwann used microscopes to study yeasts and concluded that yeasts were living organisms. In 1839, Justus von Liebig, Friedrich W\u00f6hler and J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius stated that yeast was not an organism and was produced when air acted on plant juice.[64]/nIn 1855, Antoine B\u00e9champ, Professor of Chemistry at the University of Montpellier, conducted experiments with sucrose solutions and concluded that water was the factor for fermentation.[142] He changed his conclusion in 1858, stating that fermentation was directly related to the growth of moulds, which required air for growth. He regarded himself as the first to show the role of microorganisms in fermentation.[143][60]/nPasteur started his experiments in 1857 and published his findings in 1858 (April issue of Comptes Rendus Chimie, B\u00e9champ's paper appeared in January issue). B\u00e9champ noted that Pasteur did not bring any novel idea or experiments. On the other hand, B\u00e9champ was probably aware of Pasteur's 1857 preliminary works. With both scientists claiming priority on the discovery, a dispute, extending to several areas, lasted throughout their lives.[144][145]/nHowever, B\u00e9champ was on the losing side, as the BMJ obituary remarked: His name was \"associated with bygone controversies as to priority which it would be unprofitable to recall\".[146] B\u00e9champ proposed the incorrect theory of microzymes. According to K. L. Manchester, anti-vivisectionists and proponents of alternative medicine promoted B\u00e9champ and microzymes, unjustifiably claiming that Pasteur plagiarized B\u00e9champ.[60]/nPasteur thought that succinic acid inverted sucrose. In 1860, Marcellin Berthelot isolated invertase and showed that succinic acid did not invert sucrose.[64] Pasteur believed that fermentation was only due to living cells. He and Berthelot engaged in a long argument subject of vitalism, in which Berthelot was vehemently opposed to any idea of vitalism.[147] Hans Buchner discovered that zymase (not an enzyme, but a mixture of enzymes) catalyzed fermentation, showing that fermentation was catalyzed by enzymes within cells.[148] Eduard Buchner also discovered that fermentation could take place outside living cells.[149]/nPasteur publicly claimed his success in developing the anthrax vaccine in 1881.[130] However, his admirer-turned-rival Henry Toussaint was the one who developed the first vaccine. Toussaint isolated the bacteria that caused chicken cholera (later named Pasteurella in honour of Pasteur) in 1879 and gave samples to Pasteur who used them for his own works.[150] On 12 July 1880, Toussaint presented his successful result to the French Academy of Sciences, using an attenuated vaccine against anthrax in dogs and sheep.[151] Pasteur on grounds of jealousy contested the discovery by publicly displaying his vaccination method at Pouilly-le-Fort on 5 May 1881.[152] Pasteur then gave a misleading account of the preparation of the anthrax vaccine used in the experiment. He claimed that he made a \"live vaccine\", but used potassium dichromate[14] to inactivate anthrax spores, a method similar to Toussaint's. The promotional experiment was a success and helped Pasteur sell his products, getting the benefits and glory.[152][153][154][155]/nPasteur's experiments are often cited as against medical ethics, especially on his vaccination of Meister. He did not have any experience in medical practice, and more importantly, lacked a medical license. This is often cited as a serious threat to his professional and personal reputation.[156][157] His closest partner \u00c9mile Roux, who had medical qualifications, refused to participate in the clinical trial, likely because he considered it unjust.[129] However, Pasteur executed vaccination of the boy under the close watch of practising physicians Jacques-Joseph Grancher, head of the Paris Children's Hospital's paediatric clinic, and Alfred Vulpian, a member of the Commission on Rabies. He was not allowed to hold the syringe, although the inoculations were entirely under his supervision.[128] It was Grancher who was responsible for the injections, and he defended Pasteur before the French National Academy of Medicine in the issue.[158]/nPasteur has also been criticized for keeping secrecy of his procedure and not giving proper pre-clinical trials on animals.[5] Pasteur stated that he kept his procedure secret in order to control its quality. He later disclosed his procedures to a small group of scientists. Pasteur wrote that he had successfully vaccinated 50 rabid dogs before using it on Meister.[159][160][161] According to Geison, Pasteur's laboratory notebooks show that he had vaccinated only 11 dogs.[5]/nMeister never showed any symptoms of rabies,[129] but the vaccination has not been proved to be the reason. One source estimates the probability of Meister contracting rabies at 10%.[117]/nPasteur was awarded 1,500 francs in 1853 by the Pharmaceutical Society for the synthesis of racemic acid.[162] In 1856 the Royal Society of London presented him the Rumford Medal for his discovery of the nature of racemic acid and its relations to polarized light,[163] and the Copley Medal in 1874 for his work on fermentation.[164] He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1869.[1]/nThe French Academy of Sciences awarded Pasteur the 1859 Montyon Prize for experimental physiology in 1860,[47] and the Jecker Prize in 1861 and the Alhumbert Prize in 1862 for his experimental refutation of spontaneous generation.[80][165] Though he lost elections in 1857 and 1861 for membership to the French Academy of Sciences, he won the 1862 election for membership to the mineralogy section.[166] He was elected to permanent secretary of the physical science section of the academy in 1887 and held the position until 1889.[167]/nIn 1873, Pasteur was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de M\u00e9decine[168] and was made the commander in the Brazilian Order of the Rose.[169] In 1881 he was elected to a seat at the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise left vacant by \u00c9mile Littr\u00e9.[170] Pasteur received the Albert Medal from the Royal Society of Arts in 1882.[171] In 1883 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[172] In 1885, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.[173] On 8 June 1886, the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II awarded Pasteur with the Order of the Medjidie (I Class) and 10000 Ottoman liras.[174] He was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh in 1889.[175] Pasteur won the Leeuwenhoek Medal from the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences for his contributions to microbiology in 1895.[176]/nPasteur was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1853, promoted to Officer in 1863, to Commander in 1868, to Grand Officer in 1878 and made a Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor in 1881.[177][171]/nIn many localities worldwide, streets are named in his honor. For example, in the US: Palo Alto and Irvine, California, Boston and Polk, Florida, adjacent to the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio; Jonqui\u00e8re, Qu\u00e9bec; San Salvador de Jujuy and Buenos Aires (Argentina), Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, in the United Kingdom, Jericho and Wulguru in Queensland, Australia; Phnom Penh in Cambodia; Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang, Vietnam; Batna in Algeria; Bandung in Indonesia, Tehran in Iran, near the central campus of the Warsaw University in Warsaw, Poland; adjacent to the Odesa State Medical University in Odesa, Ukraine; Milan in Italy and Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca and Timi\u0219oara in Romania. The Avenue Pasteur in Saigon, Vietnam, is one of the few streets in that city to retain its French name. Avenue Louis Pasteur in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area in Boston was named in his honor in the French manner with \"Avenue\" preceding the name of the dedicatee.[178]/nBoth the Institut Pasteur and Universit\u00e9 Louis Pasteur were named after Pasteur. The schools Lyc\u00e9e Pasteur in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, and Lyc\u00e9e Louis Pasteur in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, are named after him. In South Africa, the Louis Pasteur Private Hospital in Pretoria, and Life Louis Pasteur Private Hospital, Bloemfontein, are named after him. Louis Pasteur University Hospital in Ko\u0161ice, Slovakia is also named after Pasteur./nA statue of Pasteur is erected at San Rafael High School in San Rafael, California. A bronze bust of him resides on the French Campus of Kaiser Permanente's San Francisco Medical Center in San Francisco. The sculpture was designed by Harriet G. Moore and cast in 1984 by Artworks Foundry.[179]/nThe UNESCO/Institut Pasteur Medal was created on the centenary of Pasteur's death, and is given every two years in his name, \"in recognition of outstanding research contributing to a beneficial impact on human health\".[180]/nThe French Academician Henri Mondor stated: \"Louis Pasteur was neither a physician nor a surgeon, but no one has done as much for medicine and surgery as he has.\"[181]/nAfter developing the rabies vaccine, Pasteur proposed an institute for the vaccine.[182] In 1887, fundraising for the Pasteur Institute began, with donations from many countries. The official statute was registered in 1887, stating that the institute's purposes were \"the treatment of rabies according to the method developed by M. Pasteur\" and \"the study of virulent and contagious diseases\".[128] The institute was inaugurated on 14 November 1888.[128] He brought together scientists with various specialties. The first five departments were directed by two graduates of the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure: \u00c9mile Duclaux (general microbiology research) and Charles Chamberland (microbe research applied to hygiene), as well as a biologist, \u00c9lie Metchnikoff (morphological microbe research) and two physicians, Jacques-Joseph Grancher (rabies) and \u00c9mile Roux (technical microbe research). One year after the inauguration of the institute, Roux set up the first course of microbiology ever taught in the world, then entitled Cours de Microbie Technique (Course of microbe research techniques). Since 1891 the Pasteur Institute had been extended to different countries, and currently there are 32 institutes in 29 countries in various parts of the world.[183]/nPasteur married Marie Pasteur (n\u00e9e Laurent) in 1849.  She was the daughter of the rector of the University of Strasbourg, and was Pasteur's scientific assistant.  They had five children together, three of whom died as children.[184] Their eldest daughter, Jeanne, was born in 1850. She died from typhoid fever, aged 9, whilst at the boarding school Arbois in 1859. In 1865, 2-year-old Camille died of a liver tumour. Shortly after they decided to bring C\u00e9cile home from boarding school, but she too died of typhoid fever on 23 May 1866 at the age of 12. Only Jean Baptiste (b. 1851) and Marie Louise (b. 1858) survived to adulthood. Jean Baptiste would be a soldier in the Franco-Prussian War between France and Prussia.[185]/nHis grandson, Louis Pasteur Vallery-Radot, wrote that Pasteur had kept from his Catholic background only a spiritualism without religious practice.[186] However, Catholic observers often said that Pasteur remained an ardent Christian throughout his whole life, and his son-in-law wrote, in a biography of him:/nAbsolute faith in God and in Eternity, and a conviction that the power for good given to us in this world will be continued beyond it, were feelings which pervaded his whole life; the virtues of the gospel had ever been present to him. Full of respect for the form of religion which had been that of his forefathers, he came simply to it and naturally for spiritual help in these last weeks of his life.[187]/nThe Literary Digest of 18 October 1902 gives this statement from Pasteur that he prayed while he worked:/nPosterity will one day laugh at the foolishness of modern materialistic philosophers. The more I study nature, the more I stand amazed at the work of the Creator. I pray while I am engaged at my work in the laboratory./nMaurice Vallery-Radot, grandson of the brother of the son-in-law of Pasteur and outspoken Catholic, also holds that Pasteur fundamentally remained Catholic.[188] According to both Pasteur Vallery-Radot and Maurice Vallery-Radot, the following well-known quotation attributed to Pasteur is apocryphal:[189] \"The more I know, the more nearly is my faith that of the Breton peasant. Could I but know all I would have the faith of a Breton peasant's wife\".[16] According to Maurice Vallery-Radot,[190] the false quotation appeared for the first time shortly after the death of Pasteur.[191] However, despite his belief in God, it has been said that his views were that of a freethinker rather than a Catholic, a spiritual more than a religious man.[192][193] He was also against mixing science with religion.[194][195]/nIn 1868, Pasteur suffered a severe brain stroke that paralysed the left side of his body, but he recovered.[196] A stroke or uremia in 1894 severely impaired his health.[197][198][199] Failing to fully recover, he died on 28 September 1895, near Paris.[56] He was given a state funeral and was buried in the Cathedral of Notre Dame, but his remains were reinterred in the Pasteur Institute in Paris,[200] in a vault covered in depictions of his accomplishments in Byzantine mosaics.[201]/nPasteur's principal published works are:[16]", "9618772": "Louis Thuillier (4 May 1856 \u2013 19 September 1883) was a French biologist from Amiens. He studied biology and physics in Amiens and Paris, and in 1880 went to work as an assistant in the laboratory of Louis Pasteur./nWith Pasteur and his colleagues, Thuillier was instrumental in developing vaccinations against rabies, swine fever and anthrax. In 1882-83 Thuillier was sent throughout Germany and Austria-Hungary, conducting a series of vaccinations of sheep and cattle against anthrax. On these trips he did further research of the disease, and conducted an ongoing correspondence of letters with Pasteur. These letters mention the successes and disappointments Thuillier had with the vaccine, and have been translated into English as \"Correspondence of Pasteur and Thuillier, Concerning Anthrax and Swine Fever Vaccinations\"./nIn 1883 he was sent on a mission to Alexandria with Pierre Paul \u00c9mile Roux (1853-1933) and Edmond Nocard (1850-1903) to study an epidemic of cholera.

His second discovery of a new amphibian family was in 2012, the Chikilidae, popularly called tailless burrowing caecilians or chikilids, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society, Series B.[16] This discovery was called the 'discovery of the year' and 'another giant scientific discovery'.[17] Both these discoveries of ancient lineages (both the families about 140 million years old) shed significant light on the biogeographic history of the Earth, particularly that of the Gondwana, and in understanding the present-day continental distribution patterns of organisms\u2013while the closest relatives of the purple frog lives 3,000\u00a0km across the Indian Ocean in the Seychelles,[15] that of the chikilids is found 7,000\u00a0km in Africa.[16] Notable among his new species discoveries are India's first canopy frog Raorchestes nerostgona;[18]  India's smallest tetrapod Nyctibatrachus minimus,[19] a frog whose adults do not grow more than 10\u00a0mm; and Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis,[15] the famed purple frog./nA critical aspect of Biju's work has been the combination of molecular techniques with traditional approaches[5] bringing on par with the international practice in amphibian research. His efforts have resolved long-standing taxonomic and systematic problems and confusions in difficult amphibian groups: the bush frogs Philautus[20] and night frogs Nyctibatrachus.[21] In recognition of his outstanding contribution to India's modern amphibian systematics, scientists named a frog after him Polypedates bijui.[22] Biju's tireless endeavor brought the Indian amphibians into global limelight. The world was taken by surprise to see a frog featured on the cover of a largely macro-economics and business magazine, The Economist, London.[8]/nBiju's conservation concern for the rapidly vanishing amphibians, incidentally the world's most threatened vertebrate group[10] led to the creation of two important conservation initiatives in India. The Western Ghats Network of Protected Areas of Threatened Amphibians (WNPATA),[23] a network for individuals and institutions working on amphibians in the Western Ghats. In collaboration with national and international institutions and individuals, Biju launched a unique nationwide campaign called the Lost Amphibians of India (LAI) to rediscover 'lost' species that have not been sighted in life for as long as two centuries since they were originally discovered and described. The unique feature of LAI is the involvement of civil society including students, members of NGOs, and other non-amphibian specialists in conservation initiatives and has huge implications on the conservation of amphibians. LAI has over 600 team members and has conducted about 42 field expeditions.[4]/nBiju has extensively published in high impact factor and prestigious journals such as Nature, Science, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Proceedings of the Royal Society, and has written books on both plants and amphibians.[9]", "53855632": "Jerrold H.

This led him to work on regulation systems which control global gene expression in bacteria. Part of his work was devoted to the study of the enzymes that synthesize cyclic AMP. He established the reference classification of adenylate cyclases[3] after his laboratory successfully cloned and sequenced the genes of adenylyl cyclase toxins from the whooping cough agent[4] as well as from the agent of anthrax.[5] This work led him to trigger ethical reflections on the practices of molecular genetics and genomics at a time when this was not considered important.[6]/nDanchin started in 1985 a collaboration with computer scientists for evaluation of artificial intelligence techniques to the study of integrated problems in molecular genetics.[7] This convinced him that it was time to investigate genomes as wholes, provided that an important effort in computer sciences was initiated in parallel (in silico biology). Early in 1987 he proposed that a sequencing program should be undertaken for Bacillus subtilis. This proposal was actualized by a European joint effort on this genome, starting in 1988. The complete sequence was published in 1997.[8] The first significant and unexpected discovery of this work was, in 1991, that many genes (at the time, half of the genes) were of completely unknown function. This led him to try to organize bioinformatics in France with the help of several colleagues at universities, CNRS and INRIA, through the creation of a nationwide group, GDR 1029 (1991\u20131995) and subsequently through the coordination of the bioinformatics programme of the Groupement de Recherche et d'Etudes des Genomes (1992\u20131996), then at the Comit\u00e9 de Coordination des Sciences du Vivant (1998\u20132000).

Evans, a teacher.[2][3] Neath was named after Neath, Wales, where Evans's paternal grandparents had emigrated from in 1831.[4] Between the ages of five and six, Evans was taught at home by her parents and then attended a one-room school house in Neath where she earned outstanding grades.[5] In 1886, Evans survived scarlet fever, as did her brother Morgan.[citation needed]/nShe attended the Susquehanna Collegiate Institute in Towanda, where she played on a women's basketball team. Basketball was a new sport to women, and viewers were shocked by the unladylike sport. At one game, a doctor refused to treat Evans' dislocated finger.[6]/nAfter graduating, Evans became a teacher. In her memoirs, she wrote that she became a teacher because it was the only profession open to women, but she found it boring.[7] After four years of teaching, she took a free course for rural teachers at Cornell University meant to help them inspire their students to love science and nature.[8][6] After receiving a scholarship, she wanted to continue her studies in science. Cornell offered bacteriology for free tuition in order to encourage students to pursue the still new science. While at Cornell, Evans worked as a housekeeper and doing clerical work in the alumni library, earning her the nickname \"the grind.\"[6]  Evans earned a B.S. in bacteriology from Cornell University in 1909, and was the first woman to receive a bacteriology scholarship from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, where she earned her M.S. the following year.[1] At the end of her studies, her professor Elmer McCollum asked if she would wish to continue her studies, offering her the school's chemistry fellowship. Due to the financial strain of her studies, she decided to enter the workforce instead.[7]/nEvans was offered a federal position at the Dairy Division of the Bureau of Animal Industry at the United States Department of Agriculture. She accepted the offer in Madison, Wisconsin, and worked there for three years. She worked on refining the process of manufacturing cheese and butter for improved flavor and investigating the sources of bacterial contamination in milk products. She was the first woman scientist to hold a permanent position as a USDA bacteriologist[9] and as a civil servant was protected by law.[5] Each year, Evans took one undergraduate university course, learning German in order to read research reports (prior to World War I, Germany led bacteriology).[7]/nIn 1913, Evans relocated to Washington, D.C., where the USDA had finished building a new wing.[6] The Bureau of Animal Industry tried to block women from joining them, but Evans unwittingly was admitted through a loophole. She found the Dairy Division more welcoming than the larger Bureau.[7] While there, she worked with B.H. Rawl, Lore Alford Rogers, William Mansfield Clark, and Charles Thom. When Thom left the Dairy Division, Evans was sent to the University of Chicago to study mycology so she could replace Thom as the mycologist.[7]/nEvans became interested in the disease brucellosis and its relationship to fresh, unpasteurized milk. Her investigation focused on the organism Bacillus abortus, known to cause miscarriages in animals. She discovered that the microbe thrived in infected cows as well as animals that appeared healthy. The reports hypothesized that since the bacteria was found in cow's milk, a threat to human health was likely.[5]/nEvans decided to investigate this; she wondered whether the disease in cows could be the cause of undulant fever in humans. She warned that raw milk should be pasteurized to protect people from various diseases. She reported her findings to the Society of American Bacteriologists in 1917 and published her work in the Journal of Infectious Diseases in 1918.[3] She was met with skepticism, particularly because she was a woman and did not have a Ph.D.[1] After publishing, Evans decided to let the issue rest, knowing that her findings would be tested and verified with time.[7]/nEvans joined the United States Public Health Service's Hygienic Laboratory in April 1918 to study epidemic meningitis, which was \"one of the dread diseases of World War I.\"[7] In October 1918, when the Spanish flu came to Washington, D.C., she was asked to change her research's focus to the flu. Early in her work studying the flu, she was infected, and was confined to bed for a month.[7][4] When soldiers returned from World War I and Streptococcus spread throughout shanties and tents they lived in, Evans changed her focus again.[6] Her studies of streptococci continued throughout many years of her work.[7] She observed and published about the nascent stage of phage twenty-three years before Winston R. Maxted and Richard M. Krause published similar findings.[7]/nIn 1920, Dr. Karl F. Meyer and his team confirmed Evans's observation of cow's milk as a source of human brucellosis. Outbreaks in 1922 inspired Evans's continued research, which included studying blood samples and infecting a heifer with Brucella melitensis to see if it would be infected. Despite her colleagues' skepticism, Evans's work was repeatedly confirmed.[7]/nHowever, Dr. Theobald Smith remained an outspoken critic of Evans's discovery. In 1925, after learning that Smith had raised doubt about her findings in the National Research Council, Evans began to worry that the objections of a scientist held in such high esteem would delay the recognition of her findings. She reached out to William H. Welch, who was the  Dean of the School of Hygiene and Public Health of the Johns Hopkins University, to aid in her communications with Smith. Six months after Smith responded to a letter from Welch, asking Evans to suspend \"judgment until the unknown factors responsible for or contributing to the incidence of the human cases have been brought to light,\" Evans was invited to sit on the National Research Council's Committee on Infectious Abortion, which was chaired by Smith.[7] At the Hygienic Laboratory, Evans was infected with undulant fever in October 1922, a then-incurable disease that impaired her health for twenty years.[10] Initially, Evans was diagnosed with Neurasthenia due to the lack of recognition of brucellosis.[7][3] However, in 1928, doctors found lesions from which Brucella was cultivated while performing unrelated surgery on Evans, confirming her diagnosis.[3]/nEventually, Brucella was confirmed as the disease that caused what was then known as undulant fever and Malta fever. In 1928, in recognition of her achievement, the Society of American Bacteriologists elected Evans as their president, making her the first woman to hold the position.[11] Evans's findings led to the pasteurization of milk in 1930. As a result, the incidence of brucellosis in the United States was significantly reduced.[1]/nBecause of a hypersensitivity to brucellar antigen, Evans paused her work with brucellae. In 1936, she resumed her work, but did not handle living cultures. In this study, the team surveyed three cities looking for evidence of brucellar infection and the cause.[7]/nIn 1939, Evans turned her attention to Hemolytic streptococcus, which she focused on until her retirement in 1945./nEvans donated a collection of her papers to the National Library of Medicine in 1969.[12]/nEvans officially retired in 1945 but continued working in the field.[13] Following her retirement, she became a popular speaker, especially with women's groups. She gave lectures to women about career development and pursuing scientific careers./nAfter being retired for sixteen years, Evans returned to writing about  brucellosis. With the advent of disability insurance, the literature began suggesting malingering as a cause for failing to recover from brucellosis, so Evans encouraged further study into the disease./nIn 1966, Evans protested against the disclaimer of communist affiliation on the Medicare application, claiming that it violated her right to free speech. In January 1967, the Department of Justice agreed that it was unconstitutional and did not enforce the provision.[14]/nEvans had a stroke at the age of 94 and died on September 5, 1975, in Alexandria, Virginia.

Thus:/nThe first key experiment was performed in 1968 by Lane and John Gurdon[2] and followed by a second key experiment involving Gerard Marbaix.,[1] verified afterwards:[7] the general characteristics of the novel mRNA expression experimental system were then further defined.[8] The express publication in Nature of the 1971 paper by Gurdon, Lane, Woodland and Marbaix[8] has generated some confusion, because the very slow publication landmark paper by three scientists, namely Charles Lane, Gerard Marbaix and John Gurdon[1] appeared in print at just about the same month (September) of 1971. However, the Nature paper did emphasize that the oocyte exogenous mRNA system had already been used in other experiments (i.e the landmark paper) and the landmark paper was included in the reference of the Nature paper.[8] The key role of Gerard Marbaix (who prepared the globin mRNA) is apparent from the landmark paper./nA vital question was the extent to which the living oocyte could carry out post-translational modifications and the answer, indicating near universality, began to emerge.[9][10]\u00a0The ability of the oocyte to process correctly and locate correctly foreign particles renders this whole cell system generally useful. The system has also been used to evaluate control systems within the living cell. This basic discovery has generated a significant literature and the Xenopus oocyte microinjection system has become a standard feature of many laboratories, whilst the philosophy behind using the cell as a \"living test tube\" has spread far beyond the simple oocyte system \u2013 not least to mRNA therapeutics./nIn 1976, Scientific American published a popular article by Lane entitled \"Rabbit Haemoglobin from Frog Eggs\".[10] One can argue that the discovery of the oocyte expression system has given rise to a new albeit minor branch of molecular biology, with a substantial number of scientific papers published each year ( please see reviews by Lane CD and Morel C, Bloemendal et al, Smith M et al and Jacobson A, Lane CD and Alton). Whilst the expression system enjoys proven usefulness for receptor studies,[11] there is little direct evidence that mRNA therapeutics will have a general impact on medical practices./nIt is a somewhat amazing circumstance that the Nobel prize winners of the last 20 years have used the oocyte system to gather information.[12] Such Nobel prize winners include 2021 winners, David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for their discoveries of receptors for temperature and touch\".[13]/nThe initial studies which led to this discovery, were performed in the old Zoology Department building (at Oxford).

That which it could not do turned out to be extremely rare \u2013 the oocyte could even accurately modify honey bee promelittin made under the direction of injected venom gland mRNA[14] and could even, insert foreign proteins into membranes in a functional state.[15]\u00a0For about 14 years, Lane's research focused on the oocyte as a system for studying post translational (and other) downstream events. Lane was not interested in the use of the oocyte as a system for studies with exogenous DNA, believing that other systems were better suited to upstream studies: nonetheless, the oocyte system has its uses for such endeavors, especially as regards the study of transcription.", "33867251": "Randy Thornhill (born 1944) is an American entomologist and evolutionary biologist.

Wilson to develop an improved large-scale pertussis vaccine production technique using a liquid medium.[7] Taylor and Farrell published a paper in the Canadian Journal of Public Health suggesting that constant agitation of the samples and the introduction of a small amount of formalin could promote continuous growth of the samples and reduce clumping, respectively.[8] Taylor also conducted a study examining the effectiveness of variants on the pertussis vaccine.[9] She compared a concentrated, a heated, and a control version of the vaccine using several tests.[9] She was not, however, able to find consistency among the results and reached no conclusion as to which vaccine was the most effective.[9]/nTaylor applied in 1948 to patent a novel strategy for producing heparin, a form of anticoagulant.[10] The patent was granted to the University of Toronto in 1952.[10] Patents were also granted in both Canada and Germany.[10] The method involves mincing animal tissue, the lungs, intestines, and pancreases of sheep and cows, and mincing these samples with water to allow the proteins to coagulate over heat.[10] This coagulated sample is then digested using proteolytic enzyme to yield an extract from which pure heparin can be extracted.[10] This mechanism proved more effective than the old method of extracting heparin by applying the digestive enzyme to the sample before separating the proteins, increasing the yield of heparin in each sample.[10]/nIn 1949, Taylor developed an apparatus and technique for using formalin vapor in the sterilization of plastic syringes that would melt in a steam-based sterilization system.[11]/nTaylor also contributed to Connaught Laboratories research on the polio vaccine. In 1957, she developed a variant of the Nash colorimetric method for determining an estimation of the formaldehyde content in Polio vaccines.[12]/nTaylor was awarded the title of Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1946 for her development of a mass-produced tetanus vaccine[2] to distribute to soldiers during World War 2.[13] After many more years of work at the through Connaught Laboratories at the University of Toronto, she retired in 1962.[2]", "3458559": "The Bay Area Biosystematists is a group of biologists, geneticists, paleontologists, and systematists that are also interested in evolution.

However, the draft Watts worked on bears no resemblance to the one used for the released game.[8] More recently, he has been recruited[10] by Crytek as a writer and art consultant on Crysis 2. Technological elements from Blindsight have been referenced in the fictional Crysis 2 \"Nanosuit Brochure\";[11] the creative director of BioShock 2 has cited Watts's work as an influence on that game.[12]/nIn December 2009, Watts was detained at the Canada\u2013United States border by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to perform a reportedly random search of the rental vehicle he was driving. Watts is alleged to have assaulted a CBP Officer and was turned over to local authorities to face charges. According to an officer, the authorities used pepper spray to subdue Watts after Watts became aggressive toward officers.[13] According to Watts, he was assaulted, punched in the face, pepper-sprayed, and thrown in jail for the night.[14] The officer later admitted in court that he had punched Watts. A jury found Watts guilty of obstructing a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer. He faced a maximum sentence of 2 years in prison. Watts blogged about his sentence saying that because of how the law was written, his asking, \"What is the problem?\", was enough to convict him of non-compliance.[15] In April 2010, he was given a suspended sentence and a fine.[16] However, due to immigration laws,[17] Watts' felony conviction prevents him from re-entering the United States.[18]/nIn February 2011, Watts contracted the rare disease necrotizing fasciitis in his leg, which he has blogged about on his website.[19]/nHe married fellow Canadian author Caitlin Sweet in August 2011.[2]/nThe Sunflower series of stories concerns the voyage of a jumpgate-building ship named Eriophora:[8][21]/nThe chronological order within the Sunflower universe is: \"Hotshot\", The Freeze-Frame Revolution, \"Giants\", \"The Island\", \"Hitchhiker\", \"Strategic Retreat\".", "45663848": "[2]/n[3]/nJulie Angela Segre is the Chief and Senior Investigator of the Translational and Functional Genomics Branch in the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health.[4] She was elected to the National Academy of Medicine in 2019,[5] the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2020[6] and the National Academy of Sciences in 2022.[7]/nSegre was born in Berkeley, California, the daughter of Nina and  Gino Claudio Segr\u00e8.

He studied science at the University of Poitiers, France, and then became an assistant in the Faculty of Sciences at Sorbonne University, where he obtained a PhD.[12]/nIn 1960 Montagnier moved to Carshalton, UK as a postdoctoral fellow at the now defunct Virus Research Unit of the Medical Research Council (United Kingdom). In 1963, he moved to the Glasgow Institute of Virology. He developed a soft agar culture medium to culture viruses.[12]/nFrom 1965 until 1972 he was Laboratory Chief at the Institut Curie, then moved to the Institut Pasteur working on the effects of interferon on viruses.[12]/nIn 1982, Willy Rozenbaum, a clinician at the H\u00f4pital Bichat hospital in Paris, asked Montagnier for assistance in establishing the cause of a mysterious new syndrome, AIDS (known at the time as \"gay-related immune deficiency\" or GRID).[13][14] Rozenbaum had suggested at scientific meetings that the cause of the disease might be a retrovirus. Montagnier and members of his group at the Pasteur Institute, notably including Fran\u00e7oise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi and Jean-Claude Chermann, had extensive experience with retroviruses.[15] Montagnier and his team examined samples taken from Rozenbaum's AIDS patients in 1983 and found the virus that would later become known as HIV in a lymph node biopsy.[16] They named it \"lymphadenopathy-associated virus\", or LAV, since it was not then clear that it was the cause of AIDS, and published their findings in the journal Science on 20 May 1983.[17]/nA team led by Robert Gallo of the United States published similar findings in the same issue of Science and later confirmed the discovery of the virus and presented evidence that it caused AIDS. Gallo called the virus \"human T-lymphotropic virus type III\" (HTLV-III) because of perceived similarities with HTLV-I and -II, which had previously been discovered in his lab.[18] Because of the timing of the discoveries, whether Montagnier's or Gallo's group was first to isolate HIV was for many years the subject of an acrimonious dispute. HIV isolates usually have a high degree of variability because the virus mutates rapidly.[19] In comparison, the first two-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates, Lai/LAV (formerly LAV, isolated at the Pasteur Institute) and Lai/IIIB (formerly HTLV-IIIB, isolated from a pooled culture at the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology (LTCB) of the National Cancer Institute) were strikingly similar in sequence, suggesting that the two isolates were in fact the same, and likely from the same source.[20]/nIn November 1990, the Office of Scientific Integrity at the National Institutes of Health attempted to clear up the matter by commissioning a group at Roche to analyze archival samples established at the Pasteur Institute and the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology (LTCB) of the National Cancer Institute between 1983 and 1985. The group, led by American epidemiologist Sheng-Yung Chang, examined archival specimens and concluded in Nature in 1993 that the American sample in fact originated from the French lab.[21]/nChang determined that the French group's LAV was a virus from one patient that had contaminated a culture from another. On request, Montagnier's group had sent a sample of this culture to Gallo, not knowing it contained two viruses. It then contaminated the pooled culture on which Gallo was working.[22]/nBefore the 1993 publication of Chang's results, Gallo's lab was accused and initially found guilty of \"minor misconduct\" by the Office of Scientific Integrity in 1991, and then by the newly created Office of Research Integrity in 1992 for the misappropriation of a sample of HIV produced at the Pasteur Institute.[23] The subsequent publication in 1993 of Chang's investigation cleared Gallo's lab of the charges, although his reputation had already been tainted by the accusations./nToday it is agreed that Montagnier's group first isolated HIV,[24] but Gallo's group is credited with discovering that the virus causes AIDS and with generating much of the science that made the discovery possible, including a technique previously developed by Gallo's lab for growing T cells in the laboratory.[25] When Montagnier's group first published their discovery, they said HIV's role in causing AIDS \"remains to be determined.\"[26]/nThe question of whether the true discoverers of the virus were French or American was more than a matter of prestige. A US government patent for the AIDS test, filed by the United States Department of Health and Human Services and based on what was claimed to be Gallo's identification of the virus, was at stake.[27][28][29] In 1987, both governments attempted to end the dispute by arranging to split the prestige of the discovery and the proceeds from the patent 50\u201350,[30] naming Montagnier and Gallo co-discoverers.[26] The two scientists continued to dispute each other's claims until 1987.[31]/nIt was not until French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and American President Ronald Reagan met in person that the major issues were ironed out. The scientists finally agreed to share credit for the discovery of HIV, and in 1986, both the French and the US names (LAV and HTLV-III) were dropped in favor of the new term human immunodeficiency virus (virus de l'immunod\u00e9ficience humaine, abbreviated HIV or VIH) (Coffin, 1986). They concluded that the origin of the HIV-1 Lai/IIIB isolate discovered by Gallo was the same as that discovered by Montagnier (but not known by Montagnier to cause AIDS). This compromise allowed Montagnier and Gallo to end their feud and collaborate with each other again, writing a chronology that appeared in Nature that year.[26]/nOn 29 November 2002 issue of Science, Gallo and Montagnier published a series of articles, one of which was co-written by both scientists, in which they acknowledged the pivotal roles that each had played in the discovery of HIV.[32][33][34]/nIn 1961, Montagnier married Dorothea Ackerman, and they had three children.[11] He died in Neuilly-sur-Seine on 8 February 2022, at the age of 89.[35]/nThe 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Montagnier and Fran\u00e7oise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi for the discovery of HIV.[36] They shared the Prize with Harald zur Hausen, who discovered that human papilloma viruses can cause cervical cancer.[26][37] Montagnier said he was \"surprised\" that Robert Gallo was not also recognized by the Nobel Committee: \"It was important to prove that HIV was the cause of AIDS, and Gallo had a very important role in that. I'm very sorry for Robert Gallo.\"[26] According to Maria Masucci, a member of the Nobel Assembly, \"there was no doubt as to who made the fundamental discoveries.\"[36]/nMontagnier was the co-founder of the World Foundation for AIDS Research and Prevention and co-directed the Program for International Viral Collaboration. He was the founder and a former president of the Houston-based World Foundation for Medical Research and Prevention. He received more than 20 major awards, including the National Order of Merit (Commander, 1986) and the L\u00e9gion d'honneur (Knight: 1984; Officer: 1990; Commander: 1993; Grand Officer: 2009),[38][39] He was a recipient of the Lasker Award and the Scheele Award (1986), the Louis-Jeantet Prize for medicine (1986), the Gairdner Award (1987), the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (1987),[40] King Faisal International Prize (1993) (known as the Arab Nobel Prize), and the Prince of Asturias Award (2000). He was also a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de M\u00e9decine,[41] and was awarded the honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) from Whittier College in 2010.[42]/nIn 2009, Montagnier published two controversial independent research studies, one of which was entitled \"Electromagnetic Signals Are Produced by Aqueous Nanostructures Derived from Bacterial DNA Sequences\".[43][44] Jeff Reimers, of the University of Sydney, said that if its conclusions are true, \"these would be the most significant experiments performed in the past 90 years, demanding re-evaluation of the whole conceptual framework of modern chemistry\".[45] The paper concluded that diluted DNA from pathogenic bacterial and viral species was able to emit \"specific radio waves\" and that \"these radio waves [are] associated with 'nanostructures' in the solution that might be able to recreate the pathogen\".[43]/nThey were published in a new journal, of which he was chair of the editorial board,[46] allegedly[45] detecting electromagnetic signals from bacterial DNA (M. pirum and E. coli) in water that had been prepared using agitation and high dilutions,[47] and similar research on electromagnetic detection of HIV RNA in the blood of AIDS patients treated by antiretroviral therapy.[48]/nIn 2020, Montagnier argued that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was man-made in a laboratory and that it might have been the result of an attempt to create a vaccine for HIV/AIDS. His allegation came after the United States had launched a probe into whether the virus came from a laboratory. According to Montagnier, the \"presence of elements of HIV and germ of malaria in the genome of coronavirus is highly suspect and the characteristics of the virus could not have arisen naturally.\"[49]  Montagnier's conclusions were rejected as hasty by the scientific community, considering the gene sequences were common among similar organisms;[6] no evidence arose that SARS-CoV-2 was genetically engineered.[9][50]/nIn a 2021 interview with the French media group \"Hold Up\", Montagnier claimed that the use of vaccinations for COVID was steering the evolution of new strains, and that the process of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) would cause vaccinated individuals to suffer more strongly. The former claim had no obvious basis in fact, while ADE had only ever been conclusively demonstrated for dengue virus infections, and not for COVID-19.[51]/nOn 28 June 2010, Montagnier spoke at the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting in Germany,[52] \"where 60 Nobel prize winners had gathered, along with 700 other scientists, to discuss the latest breakthroughs in medicine, chemistry and physics.\"[53] He \"stunned his colleagues ... when he presented a new method for detecting viral infections that bore close parallels to the basic tenets of homeopathy. Although fellow Nobel prize winners \u2013 who view homeopathy as quackery \u2013 were left openly shaking their heads, Montagnier's comments were rapidly embraced by homeopaths eager for greater credibility. Cristal Sumner, of the British Homeopathic Association, said Montagnier's work gave homeopathy 'a true scientific ethos'.\"[53]/nWhen asked by Canada's CBC Marketplace program if his work was indeed a theoretical basis for homeopathy as homeopaths had claimed, Montagnier replied that one \"cannot extrapolate it to the products used in homeopathy\".[54]/nThe homeopathy paper met with harsh criticism for not being peer-reviewed, and its claims unsubstantiated by modern mainstream conventions of physics and chemistry. In response to Montagnier's statement that the generally unfavorable response is due to the \"non-understanding or misunderstanding of the breakthrough findings\", blogger Andy Lewis has written that he has found it difficult to assert what the paper \"actually claims\", saying: \"The paper ... lacks any rigour. ... important experimental steps are described dismissively in a sentence and little attempt is made to describe the detail of the work\".[55] While homeopaths claim his research as support for homeopathy, many scientists have greeted it with scorn and harsh criticism.[45][56][57]/nIn a 24 December 2010 Science magazine interview entitled \"French Nobelist Escapes 'Intellectual Terror' to Pursue Radical Ideas in China\", he was questioned about his research and plans. In the interview he stated that Jacques Benveniste, whose controversial homeopathic work had been discredited, was \"a modern Galileo\". When asked if he was not \"worried that your colleagues will think you have drifted into pseudo-science\", he replied: \"No, because it's not pseudoscience. It's not quackery. These are real phenomena which deserve further study.\" He also mentioned that his applications for funding had been turned down and that he was leaving his home country to set up shop in China so he could escape what he called the \"intellectual terror\" which he claimed had prevented others from publishing their results. He stated that China's Shanghai Jiao Tong University is more \"open minded\" to his research.[58] There he was chairman of the editorial board[46] of a new journal which published his research.[58]/nMontagnier was also questioned on his beliefs about homeopathy, to which he replied: \"I can't say that homeopathy is right in everything. What I can say now is that the high dilutions are right. High dilutions of something are not nothing. They are water structures which mimic the original molecules. We find that with DNA, we cannot work at the extremely high dilutions used in homeopathy; we cannot go further than a 10\u221218 dilution, or we lose the signal. But even at 10\u221218, you can calculate that there is not a single molecule of DNA left. And yet we detect a signal.\"[58]/nA 12 January 2011 New Scientist editorial described the controversial nature of the research, while also noting how many researchers \"reacted with disbelief\", with chemist and university president Gary Schuster comparing it to \"pathological science\".[45] Evolutionary biologist PZ Myers also described the work as \"pathological science\". He described the paper as \"one of the more unprofessional write-ups I've ever run across\",[56] and criticized the publication process as having an \"unbelievable turnaround\" time: \"another suspicious sign are the dates. This paper was submitted on 3 January 2009, revised on 5 January 2009, and accepted on 6 January 2009\", leading him to ask: \"Who reviewed this, the author's mother? Maybe someone even closer. Guess who the chairman of the editorial board is: Luc Montagnier.\"[56][59]/nOn 25 May 2012, he gave the keynote address[60] at the 2012 conference for AutismOne, an anti-vaccination group. Similar to the controversy he aroused by extolling homeopathy, his latest group, Chronimed, claimed to have made a discovery for autistic children that was sharply criticized by computational biologist Steven Salzberg.[61]/nIn 2017, 106 academic scientists wrote an open letter \"calling [Montagnier] to order\". The letter read: \"We, academics of medicine, cannot accept that one of our peers is using his Nobel prize [status] to spread dangerous health messages outside of his field of knowledge.\"[62]/nFor his defense of such anti-scientific views, Montagnier has been cited as an example of the phenomenon called Nobel disease.[63][64]", "149128": "David Takayoshi Suzuki CC OBC FRSC (born March 24, 1936) is a Canadian academic, science broadcaster, and environmental activist.

In 2004, Suzuki ranked fifth on the list of final nominees in a CBC Television series that asked viewers to select The Greatest Canadian of all time./nSuzuki has a twin sister named Marcia, as well as two other siblings, Geraldine (now known as Aiko) and Dawn. He was born in 1936 to Setsu Nakamura and Kaoru Carr Suzuki in Vancouver, British Columbia, where his parents were also born.[2] Suzuki's maternal and paternal grandparents had immigrated to Canada at the beginning of the 20th century from Hiroshima Prefecture and Aichi Prefecture respectively.[3][4]/nA third-generation Japanese Canadian (\"Canadian Sansei\"), Suzuki's family suffered internment in British Columbia early during the Second World War until after the war ended in 1945. In June 1942, the government sold the Suzuki family's dry cleaning business, then interned Suzuki, his mother, and two sisters in a camp at Slocan in the British Columbia Interior.[5] His father had been sent to a labour camp in Solsqua in the Southern Interior region of BC two months earlier. His sister Dawn was born in the internment camp.[6]/nAfter the war, Suzuki's family, like other Japanese Canadian families, were forced to move east of the Rockies. They moved around Ontario, from Etobicoke, Leamington, and eventually to London. In interviews, Suzuki has consistently credited his father for having interested him in and sensitized him to nature.[7]/nSuzuki attended Mill Street Elementary School and Grade 9 at Leamington District Secondary School before moving to London, Ontario, where he attended London Central Secondary School.[8]/nSuzuki received his Bachelor of Arts degree in biology in 1958 from Amherst College in Massachusetts where he first developed an interest in genetics,[9] and his Doctor of Philosophy degree in zoology from the University of Chicago in 1961.[10] From 1961 to 1962, Suzuki worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. From 1962 to 1963, he was an assistant professor at the University of Alberta. He was a professor in the genetics department at the University of British Columbia for almost forty years, from 1963 until his retirement in 2001, and has since been professor emeritus at a university research institute.[11]/nEarly in his research career he studied genetics using the popular model organism Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies). To be able to use his initials in naming any new genes he found, he studied dominant temperature-sensitive (DTS) phenotypes. He jokingly noted at a lecture at Johns Hopkins University that the only alternative subject was \"(damn) tough skin.\"/nSuzuki began in television on January 10, 1971 with the weekly children's show Suzuki on Science. In 1974, he founded the radio program Quirks\u00a0& Quarks, which he also hosted on CBC AM radio (the forerunner of CBC Radio One) from 1975 to 1979. Throughout the 1970s, he also hosted Science Magazine, a weekly program geared towards an adult audience./nSince 1979, Suzuki has hosted The Nature of Things, a CBC television series that has aired in nearly fifty countries worldwide.[12] In this program, Suzuki's aim is to stimulate interest in the natural world, to point out threats to human well-being and wildlife habitat, and to present alternatives to humanity for achieving a more sustainable society. Suzuki has been a prominent proponent of renewable energy sources and the soft energy path./nSuzuki was the host of the critically acclaimed 1993 PBS series The Secret of Life.[13] His 1985 hit series, A Planet for the Taking, averaged more than 1.8 million viewers per episode and earned him a United Nations Environment Programme Medal. His perspective in this series is summed up in his statement: \"We have both a sense of the importance of the wilderness and space in our culture and an attitude that it is limitless and therefore we needn't worry.\" He concludes with a call for a major \"perceptual shift\" in our relationship with nature and the wild./nSuzuki's The Sacred Balance, a book first published in 1997 and later made into a five-hour mini-series on Canadian public television, was broadcast in 2002.[14][15] Suzuki is now taking part in an advertisement campaign with the tagline \"You have the power\", promoting energy conservation through various household alternatives, such as the use of compact fluorescent lightbulbs./nFor the Discovery Channel, Suzuki also produced \"Yellowstone to Yukon: The Wildlands Project\" in 1997. The conservation-biology based documentary focused on Dave Foreman's Wildlands Project, which considers how to create corridors between and buffer zones around large wilderness reserves as a means to preserve biological diversity. Foreman developed this project after leaving Earth First! (which he co-founded) in 1990. The conservation biologists Michael Soul\u00e9 and Reed Noss were also directly involved./nIn October 2022, Suzuki announced his retirement from The Nature of Things series in spring 2023.[16][17]/nIn February 2008, he urged McGill University students to speak out against politicians who fail to act on climate change, stating, \"What I would challenge you to do is to put a lot of effort into trying to see whether there's a legal way of throwing our so-called leaders into jail because what they're doing is a criminal act.\"[18][19]/nSuzuki is unequivocal that climate change is a very real and pressing problem and that an \"overwhelming majority of scientists\" now agree that human activity is responsible. The David Suzuki Foundation website has a clear statement of this:/nThe debate is over about whether or not climate change is real. Irrefutable evidence from around the world\u00a0\u2013 including extreme weather events, record temperatures, retreating glaciers, and rising sea levels\u00a0\u2013 all point to the fact climate change is happening now and at rates much faster than previously thought./nThe overwhelming majority of scientists who study climate change agree that human activity is responsible for changing the climate. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is one of the largest bodies of international scientists ever assembled to study a scientific issue, involving more than 2,500 scientists from more than 130 countries. The IPCC has concluded that most of the warming observed during the past 50 years is attributable to human activities. Its findings have been publicly endorsed by the National Academies of Science of all G8 nations, as well as those of China, India and Brazil.[20]/nSuzuki says that despite this growing consensus, many in the public and the media seemed doubtful about the science for many years. The reason for the confusion about climate change, in Suzuki's view, was due to a well organized campaign of disinformation about the science involved. \"A very small number of critics\" denies that climate change exists and that humans are the cause. These climate change deniers, Suzuki says, tend not to be climate scientists and do not publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals but rather target the media, the general public, and policy makers. Their goal: \"delaying action on climate change.\" According to Suzuki, deniers have received significant funding from coal and oil companies, including ExxonMobil. They are linked to \"industry-funded lobby groups\", such as the Information Council on the Environment (ICE),[21] whose aim is to \"reposition global warming as theory (not fact).\"[20]/nSuzuki is a \"messenger\" / ambassador for the environmental organization 350.org advocating for cutting CO2 emissions and creating climate solutions.[22]/nSuzuki has supported ecocide becoming a crime at the International Criminal Court stating \"Ecocide is not only a crime against life, it is suicidal for us because we are the apex predator that is utterly dependent on nature's services.\"[23][24]/nSuzuki has attracted criticism for maintaining a lifestyle with a substantial carbon footprint while proselytizing against carbon emissions. Suzuki himself laments that in travelling constantly to spread his message of climate responsibility, he has ended up \"over his [carbon] limit by hundreds of tonnes.\" He says that he has stopped vacationing overseas, and aims to \"cluster\" his speaking engagements together to reduce his carbon footprint.

In spite of this, the number of studies specifically focused on safety assessment of GM plants is still limited. However, it is important to remark that for the first time, a certain equilibrium in the number of research groups suggesting, on the basis of their studies, that a number of varieties of GM products (mainly maize and soybeans) are as safe and nutritious as the respective conventional non-GM plant, and those raising still serious concerns, was observed. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that most of the studies demonstrating that GM foods are as nutritional and safe as those obtained by conventional breeding, have been performed by biotechnology companies or associates, which are also responsible of commercializing these GM plants.

Here, we show that a number of articles some of which have strongly and negatively influenced the public opinion on GM crops and even provoked political actions, such as GMO embargo, share common flaws in the statistical evaluation of the data. Having accounted for these flaws, we conclude that the data presented in these articles does not provide any substantial evidence of GMO harm.  The presented articles suggesting possible harm of GMOs received high public attention. However, despite their claims, they actually weaken the evidence for the harm and lack of substantial equivalency of studied GMOs. We emphasize that with over 1783 published articles on GMOs over the last 10 years it is expected that some of them should have reported undesired differences between GMOs and conventional crops even if no such differences exist in reality./nand", "55723658": "Marion Marie Stringer Darby (n\u00e9e B\u00fcchler, 2 August 1940 \u2013 10 October 2019) was a New Zealand marine biologist and teacher.

His PhD research concerns using electron microscopes to study the organisation of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis. Gibbons then went to the University of Pennsylvania as a postdoctoral researcher, where he stayed for 1 year. He subsequently moved to the Department of Biology, Harvard University, to take up the post of director of the newly founded electron microscopy laboratory.[1][4]/nWhile at Harvard, Gibbons studied the structure of cilia and flagella of a protozoan called Tetrahymena with electron microscopes. In 1963, he discovered a novel protein on microtubules and published its pictures.[9] Two years later, he purified two regions of the protein, known as its two \"arms\", naming the protein \"dynein\".[10] During his last year at Harvard, Gibbons demonstrated the protein making up microtubules was distinct from actin, in that the former was associated with guanine nucleotides while the latter with adenine nucleotides,[11] but refrained from naming it; Hideo Mohri from the University of Tokyo named it tubulin afterwards.[1]/nGibbons moved to the Kewalo Marine Laboratory, University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa, in 1967 as an associate professor. He found the cilia of sea urchin sperms easier to work with than the cilia and flagella of Tetrahymena. In 1969, he was promoted to professor of biophysics.[4][12] Throughout the 1970s, Gibbons and his wife Barbara showed the sliding of microtubules caused cilia motility (known as the sliding tubule mechanism), and that this sliding was dependent on the energy generated from ATP hydrolysis by ATPase. When microtubules visibly slid out of the ends of the flagellar fiber, the flagella disintegrated.[13] He then extended the mechanism to mammals, confirming the motility mechanism of bull sperm cilia is the same as that for sea urchins.[14] After these findings, Gibbons switched his focus to the molecular biology of dyneins, and determined the DNA sequence of the largest subunit of dynein in 1991.[15] In 1993, he became the director of the Kewalo Marine Laboratory.[4]/nIan and Barbara Gibbons retired from the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa in 1997; he went to the University of California, Berkeley as a research scientist in the laboratory of Beth Burnside.

Mulford Company in bacteriological techniques, and they taught him the industrial methods for production of antitoxins and vaccines.[27]/nThroughout his time at Hoagland, Avery published nine papers, one of which was a chapter on \u201cOpsonins and Vaccine Therapy\u201d.[27] He collaborated with Dr. N. B. Potter for this chapter, which was put in Hare\u2019s Modern Treatment - a popular medical magazine at the time.[27] Avery also taught a course to student nurses at Hoagland.[27] During the course, he conveyed the dangers of pathogens spread through sneezing.[27] During his teaching, he was given the nicknames \u201cThe Professor\u201d and \u201cFess\u201d.[27] While working at Hoagland, Avery was mailed two written offers from Rockefeller Institute, and he denied them both.[28] Avery did not accept the offer until Rufus Cole from Rockefeller came to offer the position to him in person.[28]/nOswald Avery entered Rockefeller Institute as Assistant in 1913, and in 1915, he became an Associate.[28] In 1919, Avery was promoted to an associate member.[28] He was granted full membership in 1923.[28] At the institute, Cole, Avery and Alphonse Dochez developed the first effective immune serum against a strain of pneumococcus, a bacterium causing pneumonia. The serum was produced from the blood of infected horses.[29]/nResearch showed that various pneumonia cultures isolated from different patients had different immunological properties.[30] This made it difficult to develop a serum effective against all of the different strains.[30] Four main groups of pneumococcus had been discovered - type I, type II, type III, and type IV.[31] Avery investigated distribution of different pneumococcus types in healthy individuals versus individuals with symptoms of pneumonia.[32] Avery found different subgroups of type II pneumococcus.[31] These groups were similar to the type strain in certain aspects.[31] However, the subgroups of type II had similarities amongst each other that they did not share with the other main groups of pneumococcus.[31] Avery wrote about the results of his findings in a 1915 paper called \u201cVarieties of Pneumococcus and Their Relation to Lobar Pneumonia\u201d.[32] In the paper, he argued that people who appeared to be healthy could be carriers of pneumonia[32] Avery also suggested it was important to identify the type of strain, based on agglutination of the pneumococci, when determining the appropriate serum for the patient. [32] Avery suggested pneumococci strains that produced more severe symptoms had higher virulence than strains that cause less severe symptoms.[32] A serum effective against type II pneumonia was developed.[33] Avery tested the serum in horses.[32][33] He processed the serum and measured its antipneumococcal activity.[32][33] Avery concentrated the serum so that a minimal amount of foreign protein was needed in it.[32] Avery wrote the monograph, Acute Lobar Pneumonia: Prevention and Serum Treatment, that was published by The Institute explaining this improvement.[33]/nAvery also helped Dochez in his research on specific soluble substances found in the blood and urine of pneumonia patients.[34] The presence of specific soluble substances in a urine sample allowed him to rapidly test the type of pneumonia without having to wait for a culture to grow.[35] Avery and Heidelberger realized that the capsules of different strains of pneumonia had different polysaccharide structures and concluded that polysaccharides play a role in immunological specificity.[36] Their work with specific soluble substances showed that it is important to consider the factor in the chemical composition of organisms to design anti-serums.[32] Avery published papers on specific soluble substance findings between 1923 and 1929, along with an additional paper he published with Goebel in 1933.[37] He worked with Goebel until 1934, and then Gobel continued their work upon his cessation.[38] Later, Avery concluded that a protein determines the specificity of Diplococcus pneumoniae after he observed that the active protein was the same for all pneumococcal strains but different than that of other bacteria.[39]/nAvery became an emeritus member of The Institute when he retired in 1943.[28] However, he continued to work in the lab until 1948.[28]/nAt the height of the 1918 influenza epidemic, the dominant hypothesis was that the causative agent in the disease was a bacterium \u2014 specifically, Haemophilus influenzae (then called 'Pfeiffer's bacillus' or Bacillus influenzae), \na microbe first isolated by German bacteriologist Richard Pfeiffer, which he had identified in nasal samples of patients infected by seasonal influenza decades earlier and which was also found in many but not all samples taken from patients in the 1918 epidemic.[40]  The failure to isolate B. influenzae in some patients was generally attributed to the difficulty of culturing the bacterium.[40]/nPeter Olitsky and Frederick Gates at the Rockefeller Institute found that nasal secretions from infected patients could still cause disease in the lungs of rabbits after having been filtered through a bacterium-excluding Berkefeld filter, but other researchers were unable to reproduce their results. Avery initially doubted Olitsky's and Gates's data, and set out to prove the B. influenzae hypothesis. For that purpose, he developed improved culture media for B. influenzae, which were widely adopted and reduced the possibility of false negatives.[40] However, B. influenzae could still not be found in all influenza patients. The true cause of influenza, a virus, would not be discovered until the 1930s.[41]/nAfter the influenza epidemic, Avery returned to his work on pneumococcus. He identified R and S strains of the bacterium; the latter caused disease and had a polysaccharide capsule, while the former lacked the capsule and was harmless. Griffith's experiment of 1928 showed that the ability to produce a capsule could be transferred from S to R strain bacteria, even if the S strain bacteria were killed first./nFor many years, genetic information was thought to be contained in cell protein. Continuing the research done by Frederick Griffith, Avery worked with Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty on the mystery of inheritance. He had received emeritus status from the Rockefeller Institute in 1943, but continued working for five years, though by that time he was in his late sixties. In 1944 at the Rockefeller Institute's Hospital for medical research, Oswald Avery, along with Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty, isolated S-strain bacteria and killed them with heat.[42][43] They used available techniques to remove various macromolecules - proteins, RNA, and DNA - from the bacteria.[42][43] Then, the killed S-strain bacteria, with various substances removed, were placed with live R-strain bacteria.[42][43] Avery hypothesized that if the live R-strain bacteria did not transform into S-strain bacteria, then the missing substance contained genetic information and was the \"transforming principle\".[42][43] Proteins were removed with protease enzymes and upon transfer of  S-strain bacteria into R-strain, the R-strain transformed into S-strain.[42][43] Therefore, proteins were not the \"transforming principle\".[42][43] Next, the S-strain bacteria were treated with ribonucleases to degrade their RNA, and the remainder of the S-strain was placed with the live R-strain bacteria.[42][43] The R-strain still transformed into S-strain, suggesting that RNA was not the transforming substance.[42][43] Finally, the S-strain bacteria were treated with a deoxyribonuclease enzymes, which removed the DNA, and the S-strain bacteria were placed with the live R-strain bacteria.[42][43] After this treatment, the R-strain bacteria did not transform into S-strain bacteria.[42][43] The lack of transformation suggested that DNA was the substance that transformed R-strain into S-strain bacteria and indicated that it was the carrier of genetic information in cells.[44][45][43][42]/nAvery's conclusion, that \"The evidence presented supports the belief that a nucleic acid of the desoxyribose type is the fundamental unit of the transforming principle of Pneumococcus Type II\" greatly influenced Erwin Chargaff, who upon reading those words dedicated his work to identify a \"chemistry of heredity\" which he later elucidated in Chargaff's rules. Chargaff would later comment that \"As this transformation represents a permanently inheritable alteration of a cell, the chemical nature of the substance responsible for this alteration had been elucidated for the first time. Seldom has more been said in so few words.\"[46]/nAlfred Hershey and Martha Chase furthered Avery's research in 1952 with the Hershey\u2013Chase experiment. These experiments paved the way for Watson and Crick's discovery of the helical structure of DNA, and thus the birth of modern genetics and molecular biology. Of this event, Avery wrote in a letter to his youngest brother Roy, a bacteriologist at the Vanderbilt School of Medicine: \"It's lots of fun to blow bubbles but it's wiser to prick them yourself before someone else tries to.\"[47]/nNobel laureate Joshua Lederberg stated that Avery and his laboratory provided \"the historical platform of modern DNA research\" and \"betokened the molecular revolution in genetics and biomedical science generally\"./nWhile working at Rockefeller Institute, Avery contracted Grave\u2019s disease, which caused him to experienced mood swings of depression and irritability.[48] After undergoing a thyroidectomy, Avery once again became more lively and began sailing, where he fell in love with the sport.[48] Shortly after, he retired in Nashville, Tennessee, where he lived close to his brother and his brother\u2019s family, where he was regarded not as a scientist, but as a pleasant family man and a kind country gentleman.[49]  While in the southern United States, Avery took a particular interest in the local flora and would act as a gardener would, learning about and appreciating the flowers and trees.[49]/nAvery's enthusiasm toward researching nucleic acids continued into his retirement, and he would continue his work with Dr. Hugh Morgan, chairman of the department of medicine at Vanderbilt Medical School.[49] Dr. Morgan was given a research grant from the Department of Defense to study immunity to streptococcal infection, and he convinced Avery to help him in his research.[49] Avery worked on this research with Dr. Bertram E. Sprofkin.[49] The two wrote a joint report on \u201cStudies on the bacteriolytic property of Streptomyces albus and its action on hemolytic streptococci\u201d.[49]/nDuring his later years, Avery became terminally ill with extensive hepatoma, or liver cancer.[49] He died at age 77 on February 20, 1955 and was buried in Mount Olivet cemetery in Nashville.[49]/nThe collected papers of Avery are stored at the Tennessee State Library and Archives and at the Rockefeller Archive. Many of his papers, poems, and hand written lab-notes are available at the National Library of Medicine in the Oswald T. Avery Collection, the first of their Profiles in Science series.[50]", "2377380": "Overton Brent Berlin (born 1936)[1] is an American anthropologist, most noted for his work with linguist Paul Kay on color, and his ethnobiological research among the Maya of Chiapas, Mexico./nHe received his Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1964. Until recently, Berlin was Graham Perdue Professor of Anthropology at the University of Georgia, where he was also director of the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies and co-director for the Laboratories of Ethnobiology.[2]/nHis work alongside Paul Kay on the 1969 publication of Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution built on the ideas of Lazarus Geiger in the field of color terminology research and has been highly influential in anthropology, linguistics and cognitive sciences. Berlin and Kay concluded that the number of basic color terms in the world's languages are limited and center on certain focal colors, assumed to be cognitively hardwired.[3]/nHe led the Maya ICGB project, a bioprospecting consortium, supported by the Biodiversity Program for the National Institutes of Health, which was closed in 2001 after accusations of failure to obtain adequate informed consent from the Maya community from which he obtained indigenous knowledge. These allegations were primarily driven by a Canadian-based political activist organization, known at the time as RAFI.\nHe was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1981.[1]/nBerlin received a BA from the University of Oklahoma in 1959, and an MA from Stanford University in 1960.[4] His Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1964 is in Anthropology./nBerlin is well known in the field of ethnobiology, or the study of how people name, use, and organize the names and the knowledge about the plants and animals around them.  He also further focused on Folk biology, a sub field of ethnobiology, which refers to the biological classification and reasoning particular to a cultural group.  Understanding societies\u2019 interactions with their environment is vital to understanding the culture of the people. Berlin\u2019s contribution to the evolution of ethnobiology as a field has been invaluable to many anthropologists. Considering \"a series of landmark publications concerning ethnobiological classification, Berlin has remained a prime architect of the descriptive and analytic frameworks now widely regarded as standard and major theory.\"(1994)[5]/nIn 1968, Berlin, Breedlove and Raven studied the botanical ethnography of the Tzeltal Maya people of Chiapas, Mexico. They published an article titled Covert Categories and Folk Taxonomy.[6]/nThey found a way to determine, with a high degree of reliability, the major outlines of the named taxonomic structure of the plant world for Tzeltal speakers.  Tzeltal is one of the Mayan languages spoken in Mexico, in which most linguists distinguish six different regional dialects.  In this study, they found many cultural and meaningful categories related by inclusion that are not conventionally labeled.  In their language, the different plants in each category all have a common word structure that puts them apart from all of the other plants. They found that you cannot trace the words back to a single source where all plant names are included.  In most languages, they have a \"unique beginner\" that you can trace the names back to.  What Berlin and his colleagues found is that plants and animals are thought of as two separate unnamed classes.  In plant taxonomy, the highest level is not a \"unique beginner\" but is instead represented by four major lexemes or units.  These four levels are trees, vines, grasses, and herbs.  There are more minor classes that include cacti, agaves, bamboos, etc.  There are also very few midlevel plant categories.  All of the Tzeltal specific taxa (those that which include no other members) fall into the different major and minor sublevels in their taxonomy.  But, it is odd to note that the midlevel category hihte, or \"oak\", contains the plants sikyok and cikinib which neither share the same linguistic structure with their \"parent plant.\"/nTo test the hypothesis they first went through the community, observed, and recorded information from their informants comments of the plants in their natural habitats.  When they went out into the field to collect data, they noticed that some of 10,000 specimens that were located in the same named contrast set were closely related than others.  They take into account the uses of the certain plants including food, herbs, firewood and so on./nA second method that was used helped with searching for possible subgroupings within contrast sets of large numbers was to determine the extent to which informants subdivided lists of plant names.  To do this, they wrote the names of different names of plants and animals on slips of papers and then gave them to their informants.  After doing this, the informants then put the slips of papers into groups that were most like each other.  The results showed that they had no trouble placing them in the different categories of \"plants\" and \"animals.\" This also showed that though they did not have a word for it they did know of the existence of \"plants.\"  After this, they broke down the taxonomy even further by giving them different \"plant\" names and asking them the same question, as before they had no problem labeling each plant into the different groups or categories./nAfter they established that they understood the existence of subgroupings, they used three different procedures to find out how they define the features of certain plants.  The first procedure was called the triads test in which the informants chose which item out of a group of three was the most different.  The results indicated how they group things together based upon similarity./nThe second procedure involved constructing folk keys.  The keys are used to help distinguish the different plants from the other based upon the traits. They then used these to get a better understanding of why certain plants were put in certain places in their taxonomy.  First they would give the informants the names of plants that they had earlier grouped together (when the researchers gave them the slips of papers with names on them), then they were asked to create a key that would help distinguish each plant from each other.  In doing this, the informants showed how they make their divisions between plants and decide which group to put them in./nFinally, they conducted a study consisting of paired comparisons of all the items in a particular set of plant names.  The informants were asked to compare all the logical pairs in different sets and make logical comparisons and differences amongst them.  Characteristics such as stem growth, size and shape of the stem and leaves, and fruit size and shape were all utilized when making the comparisons.  This showed Berlin, Breedlove, and Raven what the \"definitions\" were for a set of terms and they were then able to bring together the like terms that were the most similar according to the informant in question.  This study showed what the Tzeltal people deem as the most important features to them when they decide to on certain plants to take care of and plant for their very immediate survival./nThis results from this study shows that things that do not have names for the Tzeltal speakers still exist in their eyes.  The hierarchies generated by their studies are not arbitrarily spaced, which therefore clearly implies a taxonomic structure.  The plants still have a part in their lives and they still identify with them even though they may not have a name.  The process of having a given a name to certain life forms in their ecology shows just how much these people are attached to their surroundings.  It also shows what to them is considered a life form and what is not.  The study proves that we should not take shallow taxonomic hierarchies for granted and should have further studies concerning them to show that the different languages go deeper than we actually let on to them.  The study helps outline three great studies that others can use to set up their own studies.  It can help researchers understand why sometimes it is hard to identify where the midlevel on a taxonomy hierarchy is or even if it exists at all in a certain community./nOne of the first works Berlin published in relation to the budding field of ethnobiology was also one of his more influential:  General Principles of Classification and Nomenclature in Folk Biology (1973)[7] was coauthored with Dennis Breedlove of the California Academy of Sciences and Peter Raven of the Missouri Botanical Garden./nIn this journal article, Berlin and team intended to illustrate three hypotheses they felt were properly supported by the data they had acquired during the research they completed. First, it is possible to isolate organisms into linguistically recognized groups called taxa, or classes. Second, these taxa can be further broken down into no more than five smaller classes called taxonomic ethnobiological categories. These smaller categories are defined in terms of certain criteria, such as having certain linguistic or taxonomic feature that are recognizable. They continued to describe how these organisms, flora or fauna, belonging to each of these categories can be arranged into a complex taxonomic hierarchy. The five ethnobiological categories are as follows: unique beginner, life form, generic, specific, and varietal. Most, if not all organisms can be placed taxonomically into these categories. They turned their attentions to the formal linguistic structure of the lexemic nomenclature of the plants and animals and to which taxa each of these organisms belong to. After laying out the criteria and division of the taxa and lexemes, they used the information to discuss the Tzeltal and how they have a nomenclature system incredibly similar to that of Western botany\u2019s division of plants. The data they had obtained studying the Tzeltal and the lexemic system used to name plants was found to conform, with only a few exceptions, to the hypotheses Berlin, Breedlove, and Raven had laid out. Finally, they attempt to show how the principles demonstrated by the research suggest they can be applied to many ethnobiological classification systems since they are general. \"While data on some aspects of ethnobotany and ethnozoology, especially the uses of plants and animals, are available from a wide variety of sources, good materials on the classificatory principles underlying folk biological taxonomy and nomenclature in non-Western societies are sadly lacking (1973). Berlin, Breedlove and Raven began to encourage and emphasize the importance in gaining ethnobiological information regarding nomenclature and utilizing the principles they laid out to increase our knowledge of potentially general cognitive categorizing, the people who use these taxonomic systems, and how these systems can influence our view of the environment around us./nIn a following article published in the American Ethnologist (1976),[8] Berlin attempted to address some criticisms he had encountered regarding the ethnobiological concept of category, hereafter also referred to as rank, by applying some of his previous principles to new information on biological classification of the Aguaruna. Some claim the boundaries to determine ranks are arbitrary or that there is no validity to the rank concept. The conclusion of the report stated, \"[\u2026] the vast majority of conceptually recognized plant classes in Aguaruna are easily accommodated into one of the proposed ranks in a natural and straightforward fashion. These data suggest that ranks are neither arbitrary nor a mere typological cataloging device invented for the convenience of the ethnographer. On the contrary, the Aguaruna\u2019s view of the plant world provides additional support for the hypothesis that the concept of rank is fundamental to all systems of folk biological classification\" (1976)./nOne of Berlin\u2019s most well known contributions to ethnobiology is his 1992 book, Ethnobiological Classification: Principles of Categorization of Plants and Animals in Traditional Societies.[9]/nIn this book, Berlin analyzes the widespread commonalities in classification and naming purposes of the local flora and fauna among traditional, non-literate societies. It helps develop and reaffirm the \"universalist\" approach to ethnobiology.  He explains the \"basic principles\" that he feels form the groundwork for a comparative ethnobiology.  He also talks about the three main levels of classification; generic, specific, and higher-order.  He wants to stress the importance of prototypes and the fact that \"perceptual motivation\" underpins not only genera, but also intermediate and life form categories, although he points out that he understands that the life form categories does not neatly reflect biological taxa.  In another part of the book, he explores the patterned variations in ethnobiological knowledge.  He brings up an interesting suggestion that ethnobiological nomenclature is not necessarily arbitrary, but often reflects some aspect of the inherent quality of the organism. \"Brent Berlin maintains that these patterns can best be explained by the similarity of human beings' largely unconscious appreciation of the natural affinities among groupings of plants and animals: people recognize and name a grouping of organisms quite independently of its actual or potential usefulness or symbolic significance in human society\" (2009).[citation needed]  This implies that the ability and want to categorize is nearly innate in humans. This claim challenged some anthropologists\u2019 beliefs that one\u2019s sense of reality is determined by culture; that the subjective and unique view one has of their surroundings is controlled little by the world around the individual. He argues throughout the book against his colleagues that only natural species that have \"evident utility for man have been named.\"  He constantly argues against a neo-malinowskian functionalism.  He makes humans out to seem as simply contemplative materialists unknowingly seeking out only the things that will ensure our happiness and survival and leaving everything else to be on its own for its own survival.  He also focused on the structure of ethnobiological classification based on individual nomenclature systems he has researched or seen at work firsthand. He addressed the processes at work to affect the evolution of ethnobiology and the systems involved. Berlin has received a lot of praise on this book. In reference to the book, Terence Hays says, \"Here, Berlin deals straightforwardly and systematically with his major critics, acknowledging that \u2018the patterns recognized nearly two decades ago must now be restated in light of new evidence and new theoretical insights that have emerged since that time\u2019\" (1994:3)[citation needed]./nSome of Berlin\u2019s more recent work is focused on medical ethnobiology and modern Mayan populations. In 1996, in collaboration with his wife, Elois Ann Berlin, he published a book entitled Medical Ethnobiology of the Highland Maya of Chiapas, Mexico: The Gastrointestinal Diseases.(1996)[10]/nIn this work, Berlin and Berlin focus on two specific Maya speaking groups, the Tzeltal and the Tzotzil. As opposed to focusing on the standard ritual and symbolism approach to understanding the medicinal properties of Mayan healing, the book\u2019s focus is on the ethnobotanical approach. The Tzeltal/Tzotzil have a wealth of knowledge regarding symptomatic diseases and the medicinal herbs that alleviate the symptoms associated with these diseases. Some of the most devastating diseases that affect these people are gastrointestinal diseases. Berlin and Berlin outline the symptomology, treatment, ingredients of the herbs administered, and even the classification of these diseases. Over the time that they researched, they began to realize that the administration of these herbs were condition specific were extremely effective if the condition was known to those treating./nIn 2008, Brent Berlin and Elois Ann Berlin were recognized by the Society for Economic Botany. They received the Distinguished Economic Botanist Award. \"\u2018The work of Brent Berlin and Elois Ann Berlin over the last four decades has led to major theoretical advances in cognitive and medical Ethnobiology,\u2019 said Rick Stepp, a member of the council of the Society for Economic Botany.\"(2008)[11] Brent Berlin has generated information and new techniques of analyzing data that has influenced many well established members of the field and up and coming students who strive to be an asset to the social sciences./nIn the book, Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution (1969),[12] a collaboration between Berlin and Paul Kay, they used around 100 different languages to see how many basic color terms for each language are universal. The data they present states that there are around 11 universal basic color terms for languages in which there are always terms for white and black present in all languages. They depicted a set of stages which state that if there are 3 color terms presented, this is attributed to include red, also. There are several more steps in which other colors are then added until there are languages with 8 or more basic color terms. In one experiment, they used painted chips with several different color hues and told the speakers in their native language to point out the basic color in the focal point and the outer hues they also connect it to. This helped them gauge what difference in hues of colors people from different languages appropriated with each basic color term. Because there are many different names for colors in each society, the data helped note what the basic terms for simple colors were and how many different hues they connected to those basic colors./nBerlin also studied the classifications of color for the Aguaruna people of north-central Peru. In this research, he found out that a majority of these people match up with the stage three color views from the 1969 work, in which the Aguaruna have names for black, white, red, and a color they call grue. In his article, Aguaruna Color Categories (1975),[13] he discusses the findings of how they classify and name colors. When he mentions that they have the color grue, he states that it is a \"GRUE [green + blue],\u2026it appears to be blue rather than green\"(1975). Although the majority of the people he studied matched up with this third stage of color classification and naming, there were others that often had the names to multiple other colors and were attributed to knowing more Spanish than the others. In their native language, it is possible that they did not have words for all of the colors that are available to use in Spanish. During their research, they soon noticed that there was no specific name for the word \"color\" in the Aguaruna language. Often, they had an easier time when speaking with the bilingual people that also knew Spanish. This helped them compile an early list of 10 color terms in both Spanish and Aguaruna./nInstead of depending solely on the painted chips like they did in the previous experiment, they \"began presenting items of natural or artificial object and asking...\u2019what stain does it have\u2019, a question provided us by a bilingual teacher\"(1975). He mentioned later that they were able to find objects of all colors except pink and brown and that this type of color naming procedure helped the participants answer more quickly and was more enjoyable during the study. In addition to this way of color questioning, they also brought some painted cards because they could not find painted chips and used those along with the objects./nDuring the research, they presented the colored objects and asked which types people associated with certain colors, in no particular order, and wrote the results down. After this questioning, they presented cards with different colors and told the participants to choose a focal point for various colors and point out how many cards they attributed to each color. In their findings they noticed how people that were monolingual in Aguaruna only recognized names for the basic white, black, red, and grue while others that spoke a little or were bilingual in Spanish knew the names of many more colors presented. In his findings on the topic of color terminology among the Aguaruna, he noticed that people with access to different languages outside of the community have picked up various names for colors from a different language and brought them into the community in order for some to have access to multiple color terms they might not have had in their own language./nIn 1998 Berlin and his wife, Elois A. Berlin, founded an International Cooperative Biodiversity Group - the Maya ICGB.[14] The group was intended as a combined bioprospecting and research cooperative between the University of Georgia where the Berlins were employed, a Mexican university, a Welsh pharmaceutical company and a newly created NGO called PROMAYA supposed to represent the Indigenous Maya of Chiapas. The aim was to collect and document the ethnobotanical knowledge of the Maya peoples of Chiapas, one of the world's biodiversity hotspots with regards discovering, patent, produce and market medicines based on Maya ethnobiological knowledge. The NGO PROMAYA was established as a foundation through which the project could share rights and benefits with the indigenous holders of the medicinal knowledge./nSoon after being initiated the project became the subject of harsh criticisms by indigenous activists and Mexican intellectuals who questioned how knowledge obtained from individual Maya could be patented by researchers or foreign pharmaceutical companies, how the PROMAYA NGO established by the Berlins and under their control could be considered representative of the many different Maya communities in Chiapas, and how it was possible for the knowledge that had been collective property of the Maya peoples to become suddenly privatized without the prior consent of each of the individual initial holders of the knowledge. The Berlins argued that the establishment of the NGO was the only feasible way of managing benefit sharing with the community and of obtaining prior informed consent, and they that since the traditional knowledge was in the public domain among the Maya no individual Maya could expect remuneration.[15] As tensions mounted the Mexican partner withdrew its support for the project, and later the NIH, which caused the project to be closed down in 2001 - without having been able to produce any results.[16]/nThe Maya ICBG case was among the first to draw attention to the problems of distinguishing between bioprospecting and biopiracy, and to the difficulties of securing community participation and prior informed consent for bioprospectors.[17]", "1558190": "Michael Sars (30 August 1805 \u2013 22 October 1869) was a Norwegian theologian and biologist./nSars was born in Bergen, Norway.[1] He studied natural history and theology at Royal Frederick University from 1823 and completed a cand.theol. degree in 1828.[2] For several years he taught at a number of different schools, firstly in Christiania (now Oslo) and then in Bergen. In 1831 he was appointed vicar to Kinn Church on the Norwegian north-west coast;[2] eight years later he transferred to Manger, just north of Bergen.[2] Finally, in 1854 he was named professor of zoology at the University of Oslo (at that time Christiania)[3] where he remained for the rest of his life. He died in 1869. He was married to Maren Welhaven, sister of the epic poet Johann Sebastian Welhaven in 1831, and had 7 daughters and 7 sons.[4]/nSars issued his first publication in 1829 \u2013 Bidrag til S\u00f8edyrenes Naturhistorie (\"Contributions to the Natural History of Marine Animals\"); a second followed in 1835 \u2013 Beskrivelser og Iagttagelser over nogle m\u00e6rkelige eller nye i Havet ved den Bergenske Kyst levende Dyr af Polypernes, Acalephernes, Radiaternes, Annelidernes og Molluskernes Classer (\"Descriptions and Observations of some strange or new animals found off the coast of Bergen, belonging to the ...\").[2] He also issued two large-scale volumes under the title Fauna Littoralis Norvegiae. In all these publications, Sars described new taxa, a routine activity of scientists of the period, but he also described life-histories and reproductive cycles, food and feeding, behaviour and geographical dispersal. The British zoologist Edward Forbes had issued a series of articles on biogeography, claiming that no animal life existed at depths greater than 300 fathoms (550\u00a0m). Sars and his colleagues wrote a series of reports issued in various Norwegian journals, where they documented the presence of a number of taxa in Norwegian fjords at depths of up to 450 fathoms (820\u00a0m).[3] As a result of one of his dredging expeditions, Sars described the first living stalked crinoid to be described,[1] Rhizocrinus lofotensis.[2] This find spurred academic interest in the deep sea and prompted the Challenger expedition and other similar ventures around the globe. He was also the first to describe the sessile stage of Scyphozoa (jellyfish), and to document the development of molluscs from free-swimming larvae.[1]/nMichael Sars was one of the last great descriptive zoologists who catalogued organisms more or less equally successfully in all major animal groups. Sars also described fossils from various fossil beds in Norway and appears to have been keenly interested in all sorts of other issues. Sars was asked by the Parliament of Norway to investigate the biology of Norwegian fisheries, such as the herring and cod fisheries. He had started these investigations by the time of his death, but most of them were completed and published posthumously by his son, Georg Ossian Sars./nHe was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1855./nThe World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) lists 260 marine species named by Michael Sars.[5]", "65554095": "Aisha Somtochukwu Yesufu[1] pronunciation\u24d8 (born 12 December 1973),[2] is a Nigerian activist and businesswoman.[3][4][5] She co-founded the #BringBackOurGirls movement, which brought attention to the abduction of over 200 girls from a secondary school in Chibok, Nigeria on the 14th of April, 2014, by the terrorist group Boko Haram.[3][6] She has also been prominently involved in the End SARS movement against police brutality in Nigeria.[7]/nAisha Somtochukwu Yesufu was born and raised in Kano State,[8] and is from Agbede in Edo State.[4][9] She experienced the difficulties of being a girl in a heavily patriarchal environment.[10] She has said that by the time she was 11 years old, she didn't have any female friends because they had all been married or died in childbirth, and that by the time she married at 24, most of her friends were nearly grandmothers.[10][4] She says her love of books helped her during childhood, and reading made her realise \"there was a world beyond the ghetto that I was growing up in\u00a0\u2026 and I wanted that life\".[10] She applied to the Nigerian Defence Academy in 1991, but was rejected because she was a woman.[10] She was initially admitted to Usmanu Danfodiyo University in 1992, but after the school closed she enrolled at Ahmadu Bello University to study medicine.

She received degrees in geology, fine art, and guidance counseling. She described a new genus, Rhombopsammia, and three new species of button corals, R. niphada, R. squiresi, and Letepsammia franki./nJoan Murrell was born on June 30, 1933, in Miami, Florida, to William and Leola Murrell.[2]  She was the youngest of their three daughters.[3] Her father was a dentist.  Encouraged by her parents, from an early age Joan became interested in the life of the oceans, and she hoped to study marine biology professionally.  Her father was an avid fisherman who took his wife and daughters on weekend fishing trips, during which Owens became interested in marine life.[3] One of her favorite books was The Silent World by Jacques Cousteau.[1] Murrell graduated from Miami's Booker T. Washington High School in 1950 and was awarded two scholarships, one from the Pepsi-Cola Company and a Sarah Maloney (Art Scholarship) at Fisk University.[3] Joan entered Fisk University in 1950.  The scholarships subsidized part of her education with her father paying the major portion of her tuition.[3] However, the university did not offer a program in the marine sciences.  Instead, she majored in fine art and received her degree in 1954; her minors were mathematics and psychology.[1][2]  For graduate study, Murrell entered the University of Michigan with the intention to study commercial art, but she changed her focus.  She received a Master of Science degree in guidance counseling with an emphasis on reading therapy in 1956.[2]/nJoan Murrell taught for two years at the University of Michigan's Children's Psychiatric Hospital, and then joined the faculty of Howard University in Washington, D.C. in 1957, where she specialized in teaching remedial English.[2]  In the 1960s, she moved to Newton, Massachusetts.  While there, for the Institute for Services to Education she designed programs for teaching English to educationally disadvantaged students.  This work served as a model for the Upward Bound program of the United States Department of Education.[1][2]/nShe returned to Washington; with a renewed interest in marine biology, and the encouragement of her friend and colleague Philip Morrison, she entered George Washington University in 1970.[1] As that institution had no undergraduate program in marine science, she constructed an equivalent with a major in geology and a minor in zoology.[1][2]  She received her B.S. in geology in 1973 and her M.S. in 1976.  Continuing work toward her doctorate, she returned to Howard as a professor of geology in 1976.[2]  Because Owens had sickle cell anemia traits, her research was limited by her inability to dive underwater to search for specimens.[3] Instead, she did a laboratory project at the Smithsonian Institution, working with coral samples collected by a British expedition in 1880. Her doctoral research concerned certain species of deep-sea button corals, a group of stony corals that are distinctive in that they do not form colonies.  Her dissertation was titled \"Microstructural Changes in the Scleractinian Families Micrabaciidae and Fungiidae and their Taxonomic and Ecologic Implications.\"[3] She received her PhD from George Washington University in 1984.[1]/nNow publishing as Joan Murrell Owens, she continued her laboratory work at the Smithsonian, classifying and studying button corals, while advancing to the rank of associate professor in the department of geology and geography at Howard University in 1986.  She described the new genus Rhombopsammia and its two species in 1986, and added a new species to the genus Letepsammia in 1994, naming L. franki for her husband, Frank A.

The spore trap was a breakthrough in understanding epidemics of plant disease, identifying airborne allergens, and predicting pollen danger alerts for people with allergic rhinitis.[2] Soon after the invention, many such spore traps were installed by hospitals.[3]/nJohn Malcolm Hirst had a brother who was about five years older. Their father, who was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, died in 1928, thus causing a financial struggle for his widow and their two sons. Both of the sons were educated at Solihull School.[2]/nEarly in WW II, J. M. Hirst's brother died in a seaplane accident while flying in RAF Coastal Command.[2] In 1940 J. M. Hirst joined the Royal Navy.[3] In summer 1942 he, as a junior officer, joined a flotilla of wooden motor launches for mine clearing and escort service in the Mediterranean.[2] He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (D.S.C.) for his service in minesweeping near Trieste.[4] In 1944 he took command of a motor launch, giving assistance off the coast of Yugoslavia to partisan forces.[3] After Germany's surrender, he worked on minesweeping in the eastern North Sea.[2]/nIn 1946 he matriculated at the University of Reading, where he graduated in 1950 with a bachelor's degree in agricultural botany. During the summer of 1948 he was a voluntary worker at Rothamsted Experimental Station (now called Rothamsted Research), where he worked on aerobiology with Philip Gregory and on viral epidemiology with Leonard Broadbent.[4] On the 1st of July 1950, Hirst became a staff member at Rothamsted. There he did research, together with Philip Gregory, Frederick Last, and John Stedman, on  the epidemiology of Phytophthora infestans. Gregory, the leader of the 4-scientist team, used the cascade impactor[5] for aerobiological research. Hirst thought of a new, more efficient method of aerobiological sampling, which he incorporated into what is now called the \"Hirst spore trap\". His design was presented to Casella Ltd in 1953 for commercial production. Hirst continually improve his design. Later, Burkard Ltd commercially produced a widely used, more advanced trap using Hirst's improvements.[2][6] In 1955 Imperial College London awarded Hirst a Ph.D. for his studies on forecasting\npotato blight.[2]/nHirst's research demonstrated the value of a detailed knowledge of spore dispersal in evaluating control procedures for plant diseases caused by fungi. In 1967 he was appointed head, as successor to Phiip Gregory, of Rothamsted's plant pathology department.[2] He continued to do research on the phytopathology of potatoes and cereal crops and also developed an interest in methods and systems of farming. In 1975 he left Rothamsted to become the director of Long Ashton Research Station. His task as director was to convert the research station from an institute focused on horticulture and beverages to an institute devoted mainly to arable agriculture. He retired as director in 1984.[4]/nAt the University of Reading, J. M. Hirst met Barbara Mary Stokes, whom he married in 1957. She earned a B.Sc. in horticulture, and later an M.Sc. while working at Rothamsted Experimental Station.

He had one brother, Oliver Postgate, later a well-known animator and producer for British television. Several other members of the Postgate family were notable in a variety of fields. His cousin is the actress Angela Lansbury./nHe attended kindergarten and primary private schools in Golders Green, North London, before moving at age 11 to Kingsbury County School; he was evacuated to Devon at the start of World War II.  In 1941 he was awarded an exhibition scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, where he achieved a first class\ndegree in Chemistry. He had also taken a special biochemistry course. His final examination involved research on the adaptation of bacteria to unfavourable environments and, supported by a grant from the Medical Research Council plus a Studentship from Balliol (which the MRC deducted from his grant), he spent a year reading Microbial Chemistry before doing research for a doctorate on aspects of how bacteria adapt to resist sulphonamide drugs.[13]  Sulfomamide drugs had been shown by D D Woods, his supervisor, to block the enzyme assimilating the metabolite p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA for short), a precursor of folic acid, by blocking the enzyme's active site. A substantial excess of a sulfonamide needed to put a complete stop to PABA assimilation.[14]  Postgate's research was to study sulfonamide action on a species of bacteria that required PABA from the environment as a vitamin; it gave him valuable experience of competition in enzymology./nIn 1948, Postgate obtained a Research Fellowship at the Chemical Research Laboratory (CRL) in Teddington, West London, to investigate the biochemistry of the sulphate-reducing bacteria. A small microbiology group, led by K R Butlin,[15] was researching their role in iron corrosion and other civil and industrial nuisances. The group also investigated and advised on diverse problems in economic microbiology which had been brought to the laboratory. The bacteria were known to be strict anaerobes which live by converting mineral sulphates to hydrogen sulphide. They are difficult to culture and to separate from other soil bacteria in the laboratory, but Butlin's group had isolated a few pure strains. Postgate managed to culture large populations of the organism and his experience of  competition informed his first paper, in which he showed that selenates are powerful competitive inhibitors of sulphate reduction.[16]  He went on to obtain biochemical evidence on how they consume sulphates and carbon sources,[17][18] but his most influential finding was cytochrome C3.,[19][20] a discovery that  has been described as \"seminal\".[10] Cytochromes are iron-containing  proteins found in the cells of all air-breathing creatures from bacteria and plants to humans; they were known to be part of the aerobic respiratory apparatus and were widely understood to be absent from anaerobes. The appearance of a cytochrome, one which had an unusually large amount of iron, in a strict anaerobe conflicted with current theory. However soon it became accepted and the concept emerged of  \"anaerobic respiration\", based on reducing nitrate, carbonate or similar oxygen-containing minerals. Postgate's research formed the basis of worldwide research on these bacteria and their cytochromes, as well as the discovery of many new genera; sulphate reducers are now known to constitute a diverse biosphere of their own.[21]/nPostgate also enjoyed the Group's more practical problems. His laboratory strain reduced sulphates at hitherto unheard-of rates, and their speed revived a wartime possibility of using them to manufacture sulphur for industry by fermenting waste with sulphate. This would mimic the way in which most of the world's native sulphur was deposited over geological time. A post-war World sulphur shortage was damaging post-war British industry, so he and Butlin were sent to Cyrenaica to sample a sulphur spring and check specimens for even better performance.[22] The trip caught the attention of the press, and the microbiological production of sulphur became Butlin's pet project, with Postgate advising./nPostgate enjoyed the practical side and also made advances in understanding the biochemistry of the bacteria.  The group expanded and widened its remit to encompass the microbiological production of sulphur and the treatment of chemical effluents; it also took over the National Collection of Industrial Bacteria. He was absorbed into its staff in 1950 as Senior Scientific Officer and promoted Principal Scientific Officer in 1952.[23] In 1959, for controversial reasons, Butlin's group was disbanded and its staff and collection redeployed./nPostgate was released to take a post at the Microbiological Research Establishment (MRE), part of the Porton Down research complex at Porton near Salisbury in Wiltshire, to undertake fundamental research on how bacteria survive mild stresses such as near starvation, using both continuous and synchronous culture of bacteria.  His extensive paper on the survival of starvation by klebsiella bacteria reopened a research topic largely dormant since the 1920s and introduced the concept of cryptic growth (a sort of necrophagy) in the persistence of bacterial  populations in ancient isolated environments such as salt inclusions or fossils.[24] He was promoted Senior Principal Scientific Officer in 1961. In 1962 he was given leave to take up a Visiting Professorship of Microbiology at the University of Illinois, in the United States, to finish off some earlier research on sulphate-reducing bacteria and undertake some teaching duties. He returned to MRE in early 1963.[20]/nA change of emphasis in the research remit of MRE led to his resignation and in 1963 he was Appointed Assistant Director of the Agricultural Research Council's newly formed multidisciplinary Unit of Nitrogen Fixation (UNF), with the chemist Professor Joseph Chatt FRS as Director.  Postgate's job was to plan and direct its biological research programme.[25] The Unit settled at the University of Sussex in late 1964, and in 1965 the University appointed Postgate Professor of Microbiology in addition to his UNF position, with only postgraduate teaching duties./nThe Unit's biological research was restricted to free-living nitrogen fixers, chosen as more amenable material for its research than those requiring a plant symbiosis. Its approach ranged from biochemical enzymology to microbial physiology and general microbiology, and in due course it introduced the genetics, and was genuinely collaborative, with everyone, including Postgate, working at the bench. Almost all its research publications were multi-authored and Postgate's name appeared only on those original papers to which he had actively contributed - though he prescribed and oversaw all his staff's research directions. Outstanding papers were: a series deducing mode of action of nitrogenase, the enzyme responsible for the initial attack of nitrogen, which is an oxygen-sensitive complex of two proteins, iron and molybdenum, which requires energy in the form of Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to function and which releases hydrogen from water while fixing nitrogen;[26] the elucidation of oxygen-screening processes in an oxygen-tolerant species of nitrogen fixer and the discovery in that microbe of a second nitrogenase containing vanadium in place of molybdenum alongside the regular one;[27] the elucidation of a cluster of some 21 genes which code for the whole nitrogen-fixing system, the creation of mobile genetic elements carrying that cluster and the transfer therewith of the ability to fix nitrogen to wholly new bacteria by genetic manipulation.[28][29]  One of the Unit's plasmids came into worldwide use to study the genetics of nitrogen fixation. The Unit's reputation prospered as a world centre for basic research on the subject.[30]/nPostgate had spent March 1977-March 1978 as Visiting Professor of Microbiology at Oregon State University, U.S.A.. He became Director of the UNF when Chatt retired in 1980 and in turn Postgate retired in 1987. The UNF was later absorbed by the John Innes Centre at Norwich.[31]/nPostgate wrote over 200 research papers,[7] some 30 'popular' articles in less specialised publications, over 50 book reviews and edited books on nitrogen fixation and microbial survival. He wrote four specialist books among which his monograph on sulphate-reducing bacteria[32] stimulated worldwide research on this genus. His admired popular science books Microbes and Man,[6][11] and The Outer Reaches Of Life,[33][34] were influential and widely translated. Microbes and Man was first published by Penguin Books in 1969, and remains in print in its 4th edition (Cambridge University Press, 2000).[35]/nHe wrote book reviews and other pieces for left-leaning periodicals in the early 1940s. Later he wrote many more general and sometimes controversial articles on subjects such as the population explosion,[36] eugenics, religious bellicosity, and the public understanding of science, for publications including The Times, Times Literary Supplement, Financial Times and New Scientist.  He was elected an Honorary Associate of the Rationalist Press Association in 1995./nHis writings on family biography include three articles on his father Raymond Postgate and, with his wife Mary, his biography.  He wrote articles on and a biography of his great-grandfather John Postgate.  In 2013 he published a semi-autobiographical account of his own life as a scientist. He wrote about 10 obituaries and five entries for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography./nPostgate was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1977[2] and a Fellow of the Institute of Biology in 1965, serving as President 1982-4. He was elected Member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) in 1978.[42] He gave the Royal Society Leeuwenhoek Lecture in 1992, entitled Bacterial evolution and the nitrogen-fixing plant.[4] He served on several Royal Society or Government Committees and Working Parties on diverse matters: Space Biology; the Nitrogen Cycle; Terrestrial Microbiology; Scientists' Archives; and Genetic engineering.  Having been on the Council of the Society for General Microbiology since 1966, he became President 1984-7 and Hon. Member 1988.[43][44]/nHe served on the editorial board of the Journal of General Microbiology from 1960, becoming Editor in Chief 1970-74 and served on the Editorial Boards of the Royal Society's Notes and Records and Science and Public Affairs, also that of Geomicrobiology Journal.[45]/nHe obtained a Doctor of Science (D.Sc) (Oxon) in 1965; he was awarded Honorary D.Sc. by the University of Bath in 1990, and Hon. Ll.D. by the University of Dundee, 1997. The Society for Applied Bacteriology made him an Hon. member in 1981.[46]  His nomination for the Royal Society reads:/nPostgate has initiated some, and advanced many, areas of microbiology. He published the first serious biochemical studies of the sulphate-reducing bacteria and discovered cytochrome c-3 (the first cytochrome to be discovered in an anaerobe and the first low-potential cytochrome). He was the first to describe several new types of micro-organisms and has rationalized their manipulation and classification. His studies of the death of vegetative bacteria from starvation and cold have greatly enriched our understanding, as have his demonstrations of population effects, cryptic growth, substrate-accelerated death and 'moribund' steady states, in continuous cultures. Postgate also discovered protection by detergents from freezing damage. His recent studies of nitrogen fixation provided the first evidence for the direct involvement of metals; he has made major contributions by his purification of the nitrogenase of K. pneumoniae, by his demonstrations of oxygen exclusion mechanisms in Azotobacter, and by his recent success in transferring genes that specify nitrogen fixation from K. pneumoniae to E. coli.[1]/nIn 1948, he left Oxford and married Mary Stewart, a graduate in English from St Hilda's College, Oxford; they had three daughters, Selina Anne, Lucy Belinda and Joanna Mary.[47]  His wife Mary died of Alzheimer's disease in 2008, having become known for her reviews of spoken word recordings.[48]/nPostgate was self-taught and never able to read music, but he led the Oxford University Dixieland Bandits on cornet from 1943-8, then played with Eric Conroy's Jazzmen, 1950\u201351, and then on irregular gigs. He enjoyed jazz music throughout his life[2] and led Sussex Trugs (the University of Sussex staff jazz band which at one time included three Professors) 1965-87, then became a sideman until Trugs disbanded in 1999. He played fortnightly at Chiddingly, East Sussex for over twenty years, gaining a decent following, and also with local informal groups. After the 1970s he doubled occasionally on soprano saxophone. His youthful playing may be heard on one commercial CD, Oxford Jazz Through The Years, 1926-1963 (Raymer Sound, 2002).[49]/nPostgate wrote numerous articles, record reviews and book reviews on jazz for specialist jazz journals such as Jazz Monthly and Jazz Journal.  He served on Gramophone's panel of jazz record reviewers for some 24 years. His early guide to jazz, A Plain Man's Guide To Jazz [50] filled a need at its time but is now obsolete.

The mixed NRPS-PKS biosynthetic product comes from the marine sponge Psammocinia aff. Bulbosa. Crews research on psymberin has stimulated almost 100 studies and publications by other laboratories. Another molecule of importance is bengamide B, that led to an anti-cancer Phase I clinical trial on a close analog.[2] \nIn addition to these two molecules, Crews has discovered many small molecule tools derived from marine sponges, some of which are used worldwide by research teams as molecular probes. \u00a0These small molecules include the actin inhibitors, jasplakinolide and latrunculin,[9] the Mitochondrial Complex I inhibitor, mycothiazole, the human methionine aminopeptidase inhibitor, and fascaplysins, an opioid receptor agonist.

The first edition was published by Oxford University Press in 1998 and with the second edition being published in 2009. Crews' goal was to highlight the intense complexity of spectroscopic analysis of natural products, from which the \u201cCrews rule\u201d emerged. The \u201cCrews rule\u201d states that if a molecule\u2019s ratio of hydrogens to carbons is less than 1, then additional measures should be performed to confirm the structure.[2]/nIn 1990 he became the principal investigator in the National Cooperative Drug Discovery Group (NCDDG) program.[12], a position he held for 20 years.[2] In 2017, he was honored with a special issue of the Journal of Natural Products.[2]/nCrews has participated and led in numerous outreach programs,[13] including running the NIH-supported ACCESS program[14] for the past 27 years.

After early research on the development and histogenesis of muscles, professor Godlewski's scientific interests focused on regeneration and mechanisms regulating the process of fertilization, as well as early embryo development, blastulation and gastrulation. He was also interested in the origin of the primary differentiating cells in regenerates. He postulated the importance of epithelial tissue in this process and was the first to point out the change in the function, organization and role of the cells under the influence of external stimuli. Investigating fertilization and early development, he focused on the cooperation between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in the regulation of the early stages of development. Godlewski was also the author of the theory of migration of the inherited substances from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and, after their processing, from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. His works were never fragmentary, but always synthetic attempts at explaining important issues relating to the mechanisms of development. In 1936 Professor Godlewski was awarded the title of Member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.

He went on to the University of California, Berkeley, where his work with E. B. Babcock on the genetic evolution of plant species, and his association with a group of evolutionary biologists known as the Bay Area Biosystematists, led him to develop a comprehensive synthesis of plant evolution incorporating genetics./nHis most important publication was Variation and Evolution in Plants, which combined genetics and Darwin's theory of natural selection to describe plant speciation. It is regarded as one of the main publications which formed the core of the modern synthesis and still provides the conceptual framework for research in plant evolutionary biology; according to Ernst Mayr, \"Few later works dealing with the evolutionary systematics of plants have not been very deeply affected by Stebbins' work.\"[2] He also researched and wrote widely on the role of hybridization and polyploidy in speciation and plant evolution; his work in this area has had a lasting influence on research in the field./nFrom 1960, Stebbins was instrumental in the establishment of the Department of Genetics at the University of California, Davis, and was active in numerous organizations involved in the promotion of evolution, and of science in general. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society,[3][4] was awarded the National Medal of Science, and was involved in the development of evolution-based science programs for California high schools, as well as the conservation of rare plants in that state./nStebbins was born in Lawrence, New York, the youngest of three children. His parents were George Ledyard Stebbins, a wealthy real estate financier who developed Seal Harbor, Maine and helped to establish Acadia National Park, and Edith Alden Candler Stebbins; both parents were native New Yorkers and Episcopalians. Stebbins was known throughout his life as Ledyard, to distinguish himself from his father. The family encouraged their sons' interest in natural history during their periodic journeys to Seal Harbor. In 1914, Edith contracted tuberculosis and the Stebbins moved to Santa Barbara, California to improve her health. In California, Stebbins was enrolled at the Cate School in Carpinteria where he became influenced by Ralph Hoffmann, an American natural history instructor and amateur ornithologist and botanist.[5] After graduating from high school, he embarked on a major in political studies at Harvard. By the third year of his undergraduate study, he had decided to major in botany.[6]/nStebbins started graduate studies at Harvard in 1928, initially working on flowering plant taxonomy and biogeography\u2014particularly that of the flora of New England\u2014with Merritt Lyndon Fernald. He completed his MA in 1929 in biological sciences and continued to work toward his Ph.D. He became interested in using chromosomes for taxonomic studies, a method that Fernald did not support. Stebbins chose to concentrate his doctoral work on the cytology of plant reproductive processes in the genus Antennaria, with cytologist E. C. Jeffrey as his supervisor and Fernald on his supervisory panel. During his Ph.D. candidature, Stebbins sought advice and supervision from geneticist Karl Sax. Sax identified several errors in Stebbins's work and disapproved of his interpretation of results that, while in accordance with Jeffrey's views, were inconsistent with the work of contemporary geneticists. Jeffrey and Sax argued over Stebbins's dissertation, and the thesis was revised numerous times to accommodate their differing views.[7]/nStebbins's Ph.D. was granted by Harvard in 1931. In March that year, he married Margaret Chamberlin, with whom he had three children. In 1932, he took a teaching position in biology at Colgate University. While at Colgate, he continued his work in cytogenetics; in particular, he continued to study the genetics of Antennaria and began to study the behaviour of chromosomes in hybrid peonies bred by biologist Percy Saunders. Saunders and Stebbins attended the 1932 International Congress of Genetics in Ithaca, New York. Here, Stebbins's interest was captured by talks given by Thomas Hunt Morgan and Barbara McClintock, who spoke about chromosomal crossover. Stebbins reproduced McClintock's crossover experiments in the peony, and published several papers on the cytogenetics of Paeonia, which established his reputation as a geneticist.[7]/nIn 1935, Stebbins was offered a genetics research position at the University of California, Berkeley working with geneticist E. B. Babcock. Babcock needed assistance with a large Rockefeller-funded project characterizing the genetics and evolutionary processes of plants from the genus Crepis and was interested in developing Crepis into a model plant, to enable genetic investigations similar to those possible in the model insect Drosophila melanogaster. Like the genera that Stebbins had previously studied, Crepis commonly hybridized, displayed polyploidy (chromosome doubling), and could make seed without fertilization (a process known as apomixis). The collaboration between Babcock and Stebbins produced numerous papers and two monographs. The first monograph, published in 1937, resulted in splitting off the Asiatic Crepis species into the genus Youngia. The second, published in 1938, was titled The American Species of Crepis: their interrelationships and distribution as affected by polyploidy and apomixis./nIn The American Species of Crepis, Babcock and Stebbins described the concept of the polyploid complex, and its role in plant evolution. Some genera, such as Crepis, have a complex of reproductive forms that center on sexually diploid populations that have also given rise to polyploid ones. Babcock and Stebbins also observed that allopolyploid types formed from the hybridization of two different species always have a wider distribution than diploid or autotetraploid species, and proposed that polyploids formed through hybridization have a greater potential to exploit varied environments, because they inherit all traits from both parents. They also showed that hybridization in the polyploid complex could provide a mechanism for genetic exchange between diploid species that were otherwise unable to breed. Their observations offered insight into species formation and knowledge of how all these complex processes could provide information on the history of a genus. This monograph was described by Swedish botanist \u00c5ke Gustafsson as the most important work on the formation of species during that period.[8]/nStebbins's review, \"The significance of polyploidy in plant evolution\", published in American Naturalist in 1940, demonstrated how work done on artificial polyploids and natural polyploid complexes had shown that polyploidy was important in developing large, complex, and widespread genera. However, by looking at the history of polyploidy in plant families, he argued that polyploidy was only common in herbaceous perennials and infrequent in woody plants and annuals. As such, polyploids played a conservative role in evolution since problems with fertility prevented the acquisition and replication of new genetic material that might lead to a new line of evolution.[9] This work continued with the 1947 paper \"Types of polyploids: their classification and significance\", which detailed a system for the classification of polyploids and described Stebbins' ideas about the role of paleopolyploidy in angiosperm evolution, where he argued that chromosome number may be a useful tool for the construction of phylogenies.[10] These reviews were highly influential and provided a basis for others to study the role of polyploidy in evolution./nIn 1939, with Babcock's support, Stebbins was made a full professor in the Department of Genetics at UC Berkeley, after the Department of Botany failed to promote him. Stebbins was required to teach a course on evolution, and during his preparation he became excited by contemporary research combining genetics and evolution. He became associated with a group known as the Bay Area Biosystematists, which included botanist Jens Clausen, taxonomist David D. Keck, physiologist William Hiesey and the evolutionary geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky. During this time he also became friends with the botanist Herbert Baker.[11] With the encouragement of this group of scientists, Stebbins directed his research towards evolution. He became involved with the Society for the Study of Evolution in 1946, and was one of the few botanists involved with the new organization./nHis research on plant evolution also progressed during this period; he worked on the genetics of forage grasses, looking at polyploidy and the evolution of the Poaceae and publishing numerous papers on the subject though the 1940s. He produced an artificial autotetraploid grass from the diploid species Ehrharta erecta through treatment with the chromosome doubling agent colchicine. He was able to establish the plant in the field, and after 39 years of field trials was able to show that the autopolyploid was not as successful as its diploid parent in an unchanging environment.[12]/nColumbia University's Jesup Lectures were the starting point for many of the most important works of the modern evolutionary synthesis. The presenters introduced the connection between two important discoveries\u2014the units of evolution (genes) with selection as the primary mechanism of evolution. In 1941, Edgar Anderson (whose work on hybridization in the genus Iris had interested Stebbins since they met in 1930) and Ernst Mayr co-presented the lecture series and Mayr later published his lectures as Systematics and the Origin of Species. In 1946, Stebbins was invited on Dobzhansky's recommendation to present the prestigious lectures. Stebbins' lectures drew together the otherwise disparate fields of genetics, ecology, systematics, cytology, and paleontology. In 1950, these lectures were published as Variation and Evolution in Plants, which proved to be one of the most important books in 20th-century botany.[13] The book brought botanical science into the new synthesis of evolutionary theory, and became part of the canon of biological works written between 1936 and 1950 that formed the modern synthesis of evolution.[14]/nVariation and Evolution in Plants was the first book to provide a wide-ranging explanation of how evolutionary mechanisms operated in plants at the genetic level. It brought concepts related to plant evolution into line with animal evolution as it emerged from Dobzhansky's 1937 Genetics and the Origin of Species and provided the conceptual framework to organize a disparate set of disciplines into a new field: plant evolutionary biology.[15] In the book Stebbins argued that evolution needed to be studied as a dynamic problem and that evolution must be considered on three levels: first, that of individual variation within an interbreeding population; second, that of the distribution and frequency of this variation; and third, that of the separation and divergence of populations as the result of the building up of isolating mechanisms leading to the formation of species.[16] He used the work of biosystematists Clausen, Keck, Hiesey, and Turesson to show that it was possible to distinguish between genotypic and phenotypic variation\u2014that is, genetically identical plants could have different phenotypes in different environments. One of the book's most original chapters used the cytogenetics work of C. D. Darlington to show that genetic systems like hybridization and polyploidy were also subject to selection.[7]/nThe book offered few original hypotheses, but Stebbins hoped that by summarising the available research on plant evolution the book would \"help to open the way towards a deeper understanding of evolutionary problems and more fruitful research in the direction of their solution.\"[17] The book effectively ended any serious belief in alternative mechanisms of evolution in plants, such as Lamarckian evolution or soft inheritance, which were still upheld by some botanists.[18] Following that publication, Stebbins was regarded as an expert on modern evolutionary theory and is widely credited with the founding of the science of plant evolutionary biology. Variation and Evolution in Plants continues to be widely cited in contemporary scientific botanical literature more than 50 years after its publication./nStebbins regarded his contribution to the modern synthesis as the application of genetic principles already established by other workers to botany. \"I didn't add any new elements [to the modern synthetic theory] to speak of. I just modified things so that people could understand how things were in the plant world.\"[19]/nStebbins took an appointment at the University of California, Davis in 1950, where he was a key figure in the establishment of the university's department of genetics; he was the department's first chairman and held the position from 1958 to 1963.[20] At Davis, the focus of his research changed to incorporate newer areas, such as developmental morphology and genetics in crop plants, including barley. He continued to publish widely and extensively on plant evolution, writing over 200 papers and several books after 1950./nStebbins and Edgar Anderson wrote a paper in 1954 on the importance of hybridization in adapting to new environments. They proposed novel adaptations would facilitate the invasion of habitats not utilized previously by either parent and that novel adaptations may facilitate the formation of stabilized hybrid species.[21] Following this paper, Stebbins developed the first model of adaptive radiation.[22][23] He proposed that a high degree of genetic variability was necessary for major evolutionary advances, that because of slow mutation rates, genetic recombination was the most likely source of this variation, and that variation could be maximised though hybridization. As of 2006, research is ongoing regarding whether hybridization is an accidental consequence of evolution or if it is necessary for the creation and evolution of plant species;[24] it has been argued that contemporary studies are part of an intellectual lineage that started with the work of Stebbins and Anderson.[25]/nStebbins wrote several books during his time at UC Davis. These included his follow-up to Variation and Evolution, Flowering Plants: Evolution Above the Species Level,[26] which was published in 1974, following his delivery of the Prather Lectures at Harvard. Stebbins discusses the origins, genetics and developmental biology of the angiosperms. He argues for the role of adaptive radiation in the diversification of the angiosperms and the usefulness of applying our current understanding of species' genetics and ecology to gain knowledge about the evolution of ancient species.[27] He also wrote Processes of Organic Evolution, The Basis of Progressive Evolution, Chromosomal Evolution in Plants and the textbook Evolution with co-authors Dobzhansky, Francisco Ayala and James W. Valentine. His last book, Darwin to DNA, Molecules to Humanity was published in 1982./nStebbins was passionate about teaching evolution, advocating during the 1960s and 70s the teaching of Darwinian evolution in public schools. He worked closely with the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study to develop high school curricula based on evolution as the central unifying principle in biology. He also opposed scientific creationism groups.[18] Stebbins was active in numerous science organizations\u2014including the International Union of Biological Sciences, the Western Society of Naturalists, the Botanical Society of America, and the Society for the Study of Evolution\u2014and served as President of the American Society of Naturalists. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1952. Stebbins received numerous awards for his contributions to science: the National Medal of Science, the Gold Medal from the Linnean Society of London, the Addison Emery Verrill Medal from the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History, and the John Frederick Lewis Award from the American Philosophical Society. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1952.[28] He was awarded the 1983 Leidy Award from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.[29]/nStebbins was active in conservation issues in California during his later life. He established a California Native Plant Society branch in Sacramento in the early 1960s. Through the society, he created an active field trip program to increase interest in the native flora of California and to document rare plants. Stebbins was the state President of the Society during 1966. The society was instrumental in preventing the destruction of a beach on the Monterey Peninsula that he referred to as \"Evolution Hill\"\u2014the area is now known as the S.F.B. Morse Botanical Area and is managed by the Del Monte Forest Foundation.[30] He was a major contributor to the Society's 1996 book California's Wild Gardens: A Living Legacy. Stebbins was instrumental in the establishment of the Inventory of Rare and Endangered Vascular Plants of California by the California Native Plant Society; it is still used by state and federal bodies in the United States for conservation policy-making.[31] Stebbins was also a member of the Sierra Club./nDuring his tenure at UC Davis, he trained more than 30 graduate students in genetics, developmental biology and agricultural science. In 1973, Stebbins gave his last lectures at UC Davis and was made professor emeritus. Following his retirement, he travelled widely, taught, and visited colleagues for the next 20 years. His last paper, \"A brief summary of my ideas on evolution\", was published in the American Journal of Botany in 1999.  The same year he was co-recipient with Ernst Mayr of the Distinguished Service award from the American Institute of Biological Sciences. A colloquium was held by the National Academies of Science in 2000 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the publication of Variation and Evolution in Plants. Stebbins died in his home in Davis the same year from a cancer-related illness. Stebbins was honored at a Unitarian memorial service\u2014he had been active in the church in his later years following his 1958 marriage to his second wife, Barbara Monaghan Stebbins.[32][33] His ashes were scattered at Stebbins Cold Canyon Reserve.[34]/nStebbins made an enormous contribution to scientific thought and botany by developing an intellectual framework for studying plant evolution including modern concepts of plant species and plant speciation. His contributions to the literature of plant evolutionary biology, in addition to his seven books, include more than 280 journal articles and book chapters, a compilation of which were published in 2004\u2014The Scientific Papers of G. Ledyard Stebbins (1929\u20132000) (ISBN\u00a03-906166-15-5). Betty Smocovitis, a historian of science who is preparing a book-length biography on Stebbins,[35] described Stebbins's scientific contribution as follows:/nIn science as in everything, small-scale synthesizers usually get credit from all constituent parties, but truly great synthesizers can fall between the cracks in the cycle of scientific credit. Ledyard Stebbins was in the latter category; neither fish nor fowl, he frequently failed to receive credit for work in some areas, usually at the hands of narrower colleagues. Few, however, have challenged his contributions to plant evolutionary biology, nor questioned his ability to synthesize disparate literature into a coherent framework. His ability to read quickly, recognize novel insights, digest new material, and then integrate the knowledge were the hallmarks of his scientific work style. He was a masterful synthesizer and master of the review essay or synthetic thought piece.[32]/nIn 1980, the University of California, Davis, named a parcel of land near Lake Berryessa, California, the Stebbins Cold Canyon Reserve in recognition of his contributions to conservation and evolutionary science.

Dombeck worked closely with then Forest Service Chief Jack Ward Thomas to increase the two agencies' accessibility to public land users, and to promote ecosystem-based management and watershed restoration on public land./nIn 1997, Dombeck and the Forest Service Leadership team crafted a four-point agenda, known as The Natural Resource Agenda.[9] It emphasized four major topics; watershed health and restoration, ecologically sustainable forest and grasslands management, recreation and a long-term forest roads policy. Dombeck emphasized the importance of clean water as a forest a product, appointing a task force of scientists and economists to the quantity and value of water flowing from the National Forests.[10] He staunchly defended land conservation and science-based management in speeches delivered to U.S. Congress and congressional committees.[11]/nUnder Dombeck's leadership, the roadless rule was developed, which protected 58 million acres of the most remote national forest lands.

In an interview, she noted: \"I thought it was mind-blowing how the virus could change the shape and behavior of the cell before killing it off.\"[1] There, she developed a method to purify the herpes simplex enveloped nucleocapsid, known as a virion, and determined the number of proteins it contained using electrophoresis.[2] Following her PhD, she stayed in Roizman's laboratory for another two years, characterizing the approximately 30 HSV proteins she had identified./nIn 1971, Spear became a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Gerald Edelman at the Rockefeller University in New York City. There, she received intensive training in immunology, studying the development of the immune system in mice, tracking when the spleen and thymus become populated with T cells and B cells.[3][4]/nFollowing her postdoctoral fellowship, she became an assistant professor in the department of microbiology at the University of Chicago, focusing her research program on HSV, and then became chair of the department of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.[1]/nDuring her tenure at the University of Chicago, Spear developed a new area of research studying HSV glycoproteins in the viral envelop.[1] Her group worked to describe the surface glycoproteins and characterized their functions in cell fusion and the immune response. In some mutant strains of HSV, infection promotes the fusion of infected host cells within lesions and is one possible mechanism by which the virus spreads from cell to cell. By studying different mutant strains of HSV, Spear found that the viral glycoprotein gB promotes cell fusion, while another glycoprotein called gC can act to suppress cell fusion.[5]/nSpear has also investigated how HSV enters the host cell by working to identify cell-surface receptors recognized by the virus. Her group found that the initial cell-surface receptor for both HSV 1 and HSV2 is heparan sulfate, a carbohydrate component of some proteoglycans, and are recognized and bound by the viral glycoproteins gB and gC.[6][7] When Spear re-located her laboratory from University of Chicago to Northwestern University, her team identified three different classes of entry receptor: a cell-surface protein called herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM), two members of the immunoglobulin superfamily called Nectin-1 and Nectin-2, and [8]/nFor 16 years, Spear served as chair of the department of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.

In 2013, Gibbs and her team were the first to sequence the genome of P. mirabilis BB2000, the model organism for studying self-recognition.

She completed a summer research internship at Villanova University and two summer internships at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease studying viruses.[2]/nIn 1996, Gibbs pursued her undergraduate degree at Harvard University with an interest in studying microorganisms.[4] Gibbs majored in biochemical sciences and pursued undergraduate research with Roberto Kolter at Harvard Medical School studying biofilms on implants and medical devices.[5] She became second author on a paper exploring the role of nutrient availability in the formation of biofilms.[6] She found that the catabolite repression control protein, which regulates carbon metabolism, is essential for biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.[6] In addition to her research, Gibbs taught science to elementary and middle school students during her undergraduate degree.[2]/nAfter graduating from Harvard in 2000, Gibbs attended Stanford University for her graduate studies in microbiology and immunology.[7] Under the mentorship of Julie Theriot, Gibbs explored the movement of surface proteins within bacterial membranes and on bacterial surface walls.[8]\u00a0During her PhD, Gibbs collaborated with two other labs at Stanford to develop a novel tool to tag the surface proteins on bacteria while they were living to enable visualization of protein movement within the membrane throughout the microbial life cycle.[5] Her tool is now used today by many labs around the world.[5] Her thesis work utilized this tool to explore the dynamic distribution of LamB, an integral outer membrane protein in E. coli, that is responsible for maltose uptake and attachment of bacteriophages.[9] She found two populations of the LamB protein, one that has restricted mobility and one that has high mobility in the membrane.[9]/nAfter completing her graduate work at Stanford in 2005, Gibbs pursued her postdoctoral work in the Department of Microbiology at the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington.[5] She was mentored by E. Peter Greenberg, and began studying the biofilm forming bacteria, Proteus mirabilis.[5] P. mirabilis forms biofilms on urinary catheters which leads to infections that are often resistant to many antibiotics.[5] Gibbs began exploring the self recognition genes that she hypothesized led to the ability of P. mirabilis to form distinct boundaries between cells of different strains.[5] The study of the ability of bacteria to determine self versus non-self is a very rudimentary form of the ability of immune cells in mammals to detect self versus non-self, and thus Gibbs\u2019 work will lend insight into questions that pertain to humans as well as bacteria.[5] As such, Gibbs explored a set of mutant P. mirabilis in her postdoc that formed boundaries between itself and its parent strain, thus this mutation rendered the bacteria unable to effectively determine self versus non-self. She mapped the loci of these mutations to a six-gene locus that she called Ids for identification of self.[10] She later found that the Ids genes are transcribed as an operon and she located the promoter region of the operon.[10] When swarms of non-self bacteria approached a population of P. mirabilis, expression of the ids operon was increased.[10]/nIn 2010, Gibbs was recruited to Harvard University and was appointed Assistant Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology.[11] In 2015, Gibbs was promoted to Associate Professor.[12] Gibbs has had a passion for teaching since her undergraduate years [5] and thus teaches two classes at Harvard, \u201cThe Microbes\u201d and \u201cSocial Behaviors and Genetics of Bacteria\u201d.[13] Gibbs is also the principal investigator of the Gibbs Lab where she continue to explore social behaviors in the bacterium P. mirabilis with a focus on how cells determine self versus non-self.[13] Her lab uses genetic techniques to harness the simplicity of P. mirabilis to understand the biological substrates of cell-cell communication, competition, and cooperation.[14] In addition, Gibbs is collaborating with interdisciplinary groups at Harvard to explore the mechanisms of pathogenesis of P. mirabilis, as it is harmless in the gut, but can spread of the kidney and form biofilms on urinary catheters causing infection and disease.[15] Gibbs is also an editor for eLife for the subject area of Microbial and Infectious Disease.[16]/nGibbs was appointed as associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2021.[17]/nIn 2013, Gibbs and her colleagues at Harvard were the first to sequence the complete genome of Proteus mirabilis strain BB2000, which is the model system for biological dissection of self-recognition.[18] Gibbs and her colleagues then began to explore the biological mechanisms of self-recognition in P. mirabilis.[19] She found that IdsD and IdsE, two proteins expressed from genes in the Ids operon, seem to encode determinant of strain-specific identity for P. mirabilis and drive sociality within strains of the bacterium.[19] Gibbs and her team later found that IdsD and IdsE proteins derive from different cells within the same strain to mediate communication between cells of the same strain and indicate kinship.[20]/nWith her expertise in studying P. mirabilis, Gibbs has also guided colleagues in her field by publishing methods on how to use this bacterium to analyze the mechanisms underlying swarm expansion, boundary formation, and territorial exclusion.[21]", "83779": "Pythias (/\u02c8p\u026a\u03b8i\u0259s/; Greek: \u03a0\u03c5\u03b8\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2, romanized:\u00a0P\u016bthi\u00e1s), also known as Pythias the Elder, she was the adoptive daughter of Hermias of Atarneus, as well as Aristotle's first wife.[1]/nWhilst Pythias' date of birth is unclear, she was active around 355 BC[2] and she died in Athens sometime after 330 BC.

Nitric oxide is one of the beneficial free radicals in the artery wall and in a series of studies over the last few years he has been determining how it exerts protection over the vasculature.[6]  Dr. Darley-Usmar is particularly interested in how the interaction of mitochondria with NO can modulate cell signaling. With an extensive network of collaborators at UAB and at other national and international institutions, he is defining the molecular events which control NO signaling pathways in the diseased vessel wall. Darley-Usmar's approach is to use his insight into the biochemistry of free radicals to understand events at the cellular level. Recently, he has found that NO activates a previously uncharacterized signaling pathway in the mitochondrion that increases synthesis of intracellular antioxidants in the cell in addition to directly inactivating damaging free radicals.

He is best known as a pioneering taxonomist and malacologist specializing in Japanese marine and terrestrial Mollusca.[1]/nKuroda was born at Fukura (now Nandan-cho in Minami-Awaji-Shi) on the island of Awaji.[1] He graduated middle school at 15, and was recruited as a houseboy by Yoichiro Hirase, a Kyoto dealer in poultry, seeds and aviculture products who had founded a side business trading in marine and land shells. While his employment initially included cleaning Hirase's large house and looking after his children by day, Hirase paid for Kuroda to attend night school and to learn English, at which he excelled, and arranged for him to learn the basics of systematic biology. A rapid learner and diligent clerk, Kuroda was soon placed in charge of the shell business, and became Hirase's secretary. He was instrumental in the founding and operation of Hirase's Conchological Museum (1913-1919), which was situated near Kyoto Zoo, and handled most of Hirase's correspondence with foreign researchers. He also helped compile and edit Hirase's Conchological Magazine (1907-1915). In 1904, Kuroda followed Hirase in adopting Christianity, and through his church met many of the American missionaries who were active at that time in Japanese education, including Marshall Gaines and John Thomas Gulick./nDuring the period 1899\u20131918, a large portion of the marine and terrestrial mollusks of Japan were described by researchers in the United States and Europe, based on material sent overseas by Hirase via Kuroda. Chief among the specialists in Japanese mollusks at the time were Henry Augustus Pilsbry of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, and William Healey Dall of the Smithsonian Institution, who between them described more than a thousand marine and terrestrial species from Japan./nUpon Hirase's death in 1925, Kuroda spent two years dividing up his master's vast shell collection. One third was donated to the Smithsonian, and another third to the Natural Resources Research Institute in Tokyo. Kuroda was then hired as a curatorial assistant in the Geology Department of Kyoto University. Except for a brief stay at Taipei Imperial University from 1937 to 1940, he remained associated with Kyoto University throughout the remainder of his career, earning his PhD in 1947 at the age of 61. Kuroda was instrumental in founding the Malacological Society of Japan (1928) and its journal the Venus. During World War II, he carried out field collecting work in Taiwan and the Philippines, building on his experience in earlier expeditions to Korea and Tsushima./nThough he had formally retired by 1945, Kuroda's government pension of 100 yen per month was rendered worthless with the revaluation of the Japanese currency by the Allied administration. Together with Tadashige Habe, however, he was hired as a consultant by Dr. Alvin Cahn of the Natural Resources Division at SCAP in Tokyo. Cahn drew on Kuroda's knowledge and command of English to help him compile reports on the Japanese pearl industry and other aspects of mariculture, and in return paid Kuroda a stipend and arranged for him to receive travel grants and some basic support for his research. In 1952, Kuroda and Habe published their Checklist of the Marine Mollusca of Japan through Colonel Leo Stach of SCAP./nKuroda retired from SCAP in 1951, and became an emeritus researcher at Kyoto University. From 1966, his home was a suite of rooms at the Kaisei Hospital at Koroen in Nishinomiya City,  under the care of the hospital's director Dr. Norio Kikuchi. Kuroda attended regular meetings of the Hanshin Shell Club and the Malacological Society of Japan into his late 90s, and died a few months short of his 101st birthday./nKuroda first met the Showa Emperor (Hirohito) at a soiree shortly before the opening of the Hirase Conchological Museum in 1912, while the latter was still Crown Prince. Hirohito's lifelong interest in marine invertebrates is thought to have originated with the commemorative collection of shells he received at this event. In 1971, Kuroda, Habe and Katsura \u014cyama were selected to co-author a monograph of the Sea Shells of Sagami Bay, published by Maruzen in Tokyo under the auspices of the Imperial Household Biological Laboratory./nThe Japanese malacological literature has mirrored its German counterpart with commemorative articles and festschrifts published on the key birthdays of well-known malacologists.

She was one of the first women to explore the Arctic and have charge of a polar expedition. Raised in an polyamorous household in Kostroma, she attended the first women's gymnasium in Russia from 1907 to 1914 and then studied to become a teacher. After taking workers courses under Lenin's wife Nadezhda Krupskaya, she taught collectivism in the Ufa Governorate before settling in Leningrad in 1921 to study at the Geographical Institute. For eight years, she studied geography and biology, participating in numerous field trips on polar research./nGraduating in 1929, Demme went to work at the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute and participated in a two-year expedition to Franz Josef Land, during which she was the only woman in the group. Chosen to lead an expedition to Severnaya Zemlya, known then as the Kamenev Islands, she and her team of three men mapped the western part of the archipelago and conducted research on the plants and animals. Returning to Leningrad in 1934, she researched the commercial collective farming potential of animals of the north and for several seasons studied black foxes and the possibilities of breeding eiders. Earning her Candidate's Degree in biology in 1946, she became a professor but was discontent to remain in the classroom and continued to make research trips until she retired in 1959. In her retirement, she painted, and planted a large garden of flowers and trees, which she maintained until her death in 1977./nNina was born in 1902 in Kostroma in the Russian Empire to Maria Ivanovna Ryabtsova and Ludwig Fedorovich Demme. She was an illegitimate child[1][2] of a polyamorous household which was made up of her father's first wife and nine children, and her mother and mother's five children. Her half-siblings were Valya and Kolya by her mother's first husband, a German surnamed Huber. Nina, Julia, and Seryozha were full siblings from her mother's relationship with her father. Because her blood siblings were all illegitimate, they were registered with the family patronymic Petrovna,[1] after her godfather Petr Ryabtsov,[3] and with their mother's surname, Ryabtsov. Forged papers, showing her name as Nina Petrovna Demme-Ryabtseva, allowed Demme to be the only child to carry her father's surname or enter high school (gymnasium).[1]/nHer father was a German noble, originally named Ludwig von Medem\u00a0[de], who changed his surname to Demme and arrived in Russia where he ran a bicycle shop in Galich. Soon he relocated to Kostroma and began a relationship with Ryabtsova, who managed a brewery left to her by her first husband. After he had sent for his first family in Germany, the blended families rented the house which would later become the Pushkin Library in Kostroma. Ryabtsova, Ludwig, and her children occupied the top floor of the building, and his first family lived in the garden house. Later, he built a house for the mixed family at #23 Pastukhovskaya. The relationships between his wives and children were friendly and they all worked together on the farm, which produced poultry, as well as fruits and flowers for local sale.

For eight years she studied at the institute, which later became the geography department of Leningrad University.[5] During research trips, she participated in expeditions to the Caucasus and Crimea[1] and worked on projects including road construction in Leningrad and dog training along the railway from Termez to Dushanbe.[5] In 1926, Demme led an expedition to the Kara Sea;[6] in 1927, she conducted research in the Urals; afterwards, she completed field work in Central Asia around Amu Darya to prepare for land reforms.[5][7] While she was in school, she met and married fellow student and polar explorer Ivan Markieltevich Ivanov\u00a0[ru].[8] Her husband had been part of the rescue attempt in 1928 to save Umberto Nobile, an Italian polar explorer, and his crew after they crashed their dirigible balloon.[1][5][9]/nIn 1929, Demme graduated and went to work at the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute when it was founded in 1930.[5][9] Because of her extensive experience and research background, Demme was selected to participate in an expedition on the icebreaker George Sedov, which planned to winter on Franz Josef Land. Ivanov was sent to manage the polar station in Tikhaya Bay on Hooker Island, the 11 scientists being led by Otto Schmidt.[5] Demme was the only woman among them[Notes 1] and international news coverage at the time claimed she was the first woman to have explored the Arctic.[8][11][2][Notes 2] Her work involved both geographical and biological studies, and the crew wintered for two years on the island.[8][9] When not making expeditions to study the wildlife and plants, Demme assisted the hydrologist in his measurements.[14][15] During the expedition, Demme and Ivanov divorced, and she married another of the scientists. When they returned from the trip, that marriage ended, and she married Gabriel Ignatievich Ioylev, a radio operator.[16][17][Notes 3]/nIn 1932, she led a team of three men, including a hunter, meteorologist, and her husband, Ioylev, the radio operator, to winter in the Kamenev Islands, and newspapers reported that she had been the first woman to lead a polar expedition.[9][19] The group sailed on the Roussanov, arriving on 14 August[20] and settling into the cabin which had a large bedroom with bunk beds and a library, as well a large dining table, where they listened to concerts and news broadcasts each evening during dinner.[21] She was made governor of the archipelago and had the authority to direct commerce, immigration, and other affairs of state.[19] The group was to remain one winter and evaluate the commercial possibilities for the flora and fauna of the islands.[22] They gathered geological and botanical samples, studied the various animals on their expeditions,[20] and mapped the western part of Severnaya Zemlya.[21] As icebreakers were unable to reach, them the team ended up wintering a second year in the Arctic.[19][20] Various mishaps befell the crew, including one when, while out hunting, the men mistook Demme for a polar bear and she began to sing an aria from La traviata so they would know she was not their prey.[21] In September 1934, Alexander Alexiev, a government pilot, flew from Siberia and was able to extract Demme and her crew, as well as Boris Lavrov and his pilot, who had been on an expedition of the Lena River before their plane crashed and they walked 185 miles to reach the Kamenev station.[23]/nReturning to Leningrad, Demme began post-graduate studies at the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute, where she also taught courses in biology and zoology. She was interested in researching the commercial collective farming potential of animals of the north and for several seasons studied black foxes.[1][24] Because she could not get the institute to finance her expeditions, Demme chartered small fishing boats to take her to remote Arctic huts so that she could carry out her research.[25] Beginning around 1940, she utilized methods established in Iceland to create experimental eider farms in Novaya Zemlya and on Vaygach Island.[26][27] By setting up nesting shelters and killing the predators of the birds, locals under her leadership were able to collect 5,354 kilograms (11,804\u00a0lb) of eiderdown over a five-year period.[27][28] Demme completed her dissertation, \u0413\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0433\u0430\u0433\u0438 \u043e\u0431\u044b\u043a\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0417\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0435 \u0438 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0433\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0447\u044c\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 (Nesting Colonies of the Common Eider on Novaya Zemlya and the Organization of the Eiderdown Economy) in 1946, earning her Candidate's Degree in biology.[1]/nDemme was made an associate professor in 1949, but did not like the confinement of the classroom. She continued to hire small commercial vessels to allow her to study wildlife in the Arctic into the 1950s.[25] In 1949, she conducted research in the Kandalaksha Nature Reserve on the White Sea, extending her work on eiders. At the reserve, she attempted to develop domesticated hatcheries, which she had unsuccessfully tried to establish in Novaya Zemlya. Though successful, the group of chicks she brought back to Leningrad at the end of the season failed to thrive and all died. In 1952, Demme made her last trip to the Arctic, working in the northern parts of the Gulf of Ob in Siberia, and focusing on raising animals there. She did not return to the Kandalaksha Reserve, though others continued to study eider chicks there. Though she was not involved,[3] her experimental eiderdown farms operated until 1954, when they were closed and the native inhabitants of Novaya Zemlya were removed in preparation for nuclear tests.[27] In 1959, she retired and wrote her autobiography.[25] She was allowed to buy a summer house on the Black Sea coast and chose a place between Sochi and Tuapse near Volkonskaya, where she built a home and an extensive garden, which had various kinds of flowers and trees. An accomplished musician and skilled artist, she also created paintings.[18]/nDemme died on 16 March 1977 in Leningrad[25] from phlegmon after she was given an injection for a congenital heart defect. She was cremated there, and her remains were taken to Kostroma for burial. The family was unable to convince local authorities to allocate marble for a tombstone.[18] In 2017, her grave was located in the local cemetery on Kostromskaya Street. She is remembered as one of the first women polar explorers.[29] There has been renewed interest in the 21st century in her work on eiderdown production.[27][28]", "56149878": "Karla Satchell, born Karla Fullner, is an American microbiologist who is currently a professor at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine[1] and an elected fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.[2]/nShe earned her Ph.D at University of Washington in 1996 and conducted postdoctoral training with John Mekalanos at Harvard Medical School.[1]/nHer interests are bacteriology, structural biology, and immunology,[3] cytoskeleton, cellular microbiology, bacteria and diseases[4] and pathogenesis.[1] She is especially known for defining how the MARTX toxin in Vibrio cholerae is a modular protein that delivers its constituent effectors to host cells.[5]/nSatchell is head of the Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases at Northwestern.

At his Burbage laboratories, a part of the family plant nurseries, Hurst carried out his studies on hybridisation in orchids. He wrote an early paper proposing that new species evolved from hybridisation, based on his orchid knowledge, in 1898,[2] almost two decades before similar theories were published by Johannes Paulus Lotsy.[3] Hurst was a frequent correspondent and friend to William Bateson and helped in the introduction of Mendelian genetics in the early 20th century./nAlso in Burbage, Hurst collected the first data to advance the theory that blue eye colour was recessive to brown. He carried out many investigations into the genetics of coat colour inheritance in horses, chickens and other domestic animals. As well as studying eye colour in humans, he was an ardent eugenicist and believed fervently that the human race could be improved by genetic study. In his book on 'Creative Evolution'[4] he advocated a theory of musical ability based on Mendelian loci./nAlthough an early promoter and lifelong supporter of Mendelian genetics and a friend of Bateson's, he appears to have parted ways with his mentor on some points. In his 1932 book on The Mechanism of Creative Evolution[5] Hurst adopted the chromosome theory of inheritance whole-heartedly referring copiously to Thomas Hunt Morgan's Drosophila work, and he was also clearly a staunch Darwinist. He believed that natural selection and Mendelian genetics were compatible, and referred to the theoretical work of Sewall Wright, R.A. Fisher, and J.B.S. Haldane, which proved that quantitative traits and natural selection were compatible with Mendelism. As he argued in Creative Evolution (1932), p. xix:/nHurst was also a major initiator of the modern \"genetical species concept\" later known as the biological species concept. This was very much in tune with William Bateson's own beliefs, and Bateson's views on this topic were accepted by many other geneticists worldwide, including Theodosius Dobzhansky.  Here is Hurst's concept of species in Creative Evolution (1932), p.\u00a066-7:/nSuch views were typical of the stance in evolutionary biology, adopted later by and today mainly credited to Theodosius Dobzhansky and Ernst Mayr, and dubbed \"The Modern Synthesis\" by Julian Huxley in 1942./nHurst was famous for his work on hybridisation and breeding in orchids, but also for carrying out early studies into eye colour genetics (demonstrating the dominance of brown eyes over blue in 1905), and animal coat coloration (in subjects ranging from horses to chickens)./nWilliam Bateson was credited as the scientist who first brought Mendel's theories to the English speaking-world, and the coiner of the term 'genetics'.  Given the nickname 'Bateson's Bulldog',[6] Hurst has been described along with Bateson as one of the two leaders of Mendelism in England at the turn of the 20th century. Bateson and Hurst collaborated in the battle against the biometricians Karl Pearson and Walter Frank Raphael Weldon, with Hurst generating much data from experimental crosses of different plant varieties and animal colour variants, including chickens, horses, and man. Together they practically proved that Mendelian genetics could be extended to many different systems.

This argument has not, within my knowledge, been so clearly and forcibly set forth by any other writer.

Flies that expressed the mutant form of the protein showed symptoms and characteristics similar to those seen in human polyQ disease patients; flies that expressed the normal protein did not.[23][24]/nStudying Polyglutamine repeat diseases (polyQ diseases) in Drosophila neurodegeneration models, Bonini's research group elucidated an important role for molecular chaperones in polyQ diseases,[25] and subsequently Parkinson's disease.[7][23][26] In those studies, upregulation of the chaperone Hsp70 suppressed neurodegeneration, and this finding established chaperones as a new therapeutic target for Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.[7][26][27] Bonini's research team demonstrated the pharmacologic potential of chaperones in further Drosophila studies; administering geldanamycin (an antitumor antibiotic that acts on Hsp90) to mutant flies before symptoms of neural decline were visible averted the onset of neurodegeneration in the mutant flies, suggesting a new approach for people susceptible to Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions.[28]/nBonini's research laboratory developed and validated a Drosophila model for familial ALS,[9][29][30] then used an ALS model to evaluate genes and pathways important for ALS onset, progression, and possible treatment.[31][32] Through these studies, Bonini's team, in collaboration with Aaron Gitler, discovered that ATXN2 (the gene that encodes the protein Ataxin-2) was a disease susceptibility gene for ALS, and that interrupting the interaction between TDP-43 and Ataxin-2 was a promising target for treating ALS and other diseases.[30][31][32][33][34]/nThe Bonini lab discovered that a conserved microRNA, miR-34, plays a neuroprotective role in the brains of aging Drosophila.[35] The loss of miR-34 resulted in a profile consistent with accelerated aging, late-onset brain neurodegeneration, and reduced survival, whereas upregulation of miR-34 enhanced survival and mitigated neurodegeneration.[35][36]/nIn 2018, Bonini, with collaborators Shelley Berger, Brad Johnson, and others, completed a study investigating the epigenetic landscape of tissue samples donated by individuals who did and did not have Alzheimer's disease. The findings established the basis for an epigenetic link between aging and Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a new model for the disease and a paradigm shift from the previously established view of Alzheimer's disease as an 'advanced state of normal aging'.

He is also known for his innovative left-step  presentation of the periodic table of chemical elements.[3]/nJanet graduated from the \u00c9cole Centrale Paris in 1872,[1]:\u200a57\u200a and worked for some years as a chemist and engineer in a few factories in Puteaux (1872), Rouen (1873\u20134), and Saint-Ouen (1875\u20136).[1]:\u200a61\u201365\u200a He was then employed by Philippe Alphonse Dupont, at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 A. Dupont & Cie, a factory that produced bone buttons and fine brushes. He married Berthe Marie Antonia Dupont, the daughter of the owner, in November 1877, and worked there for the rest of his life, finding time for research in various branches of science.[1] His collection of 50,000 fossils and other specimens was unfortunately dispersed after his death.[2][4]\nHis studies of the morphology of the head of ants, wasps and bees, and his micrographs were of remarkable quality.[5] He also worked on plant biology and finally wrote a series of papers on evolution. He was a prolific inventor and designed much of his own equipment, including the formicarium, in which an ant colony is made visible by being formed between two panes of glass.[6] In 1927 he turned his attention to the periodic table and wrote a series of six articles in French, which were privately printed and never widely circulated. His only article in English was poorly edited and gave a confused idea of his thinking.[7]/nIn parallel with his professional activities, Charles Janet began a university course at the Sorbonne in 1886. He was also co-opted to become a member of the French Entomological Society and the French Zoological Society. First in his class, he then began a thesis on ants and obtained his doctorate in natural sciences in 1900. Even before the end of his studies, the French Academy of Sciences regularly published his research in its reports and awarded him the Thore Prize in 1896.[8][9] In 1899, he was elected president of the French Zoological Society. In 1900, he improved his artificial nests and won great success with them at the Universal Exhibition in Paris.[10] His popularity was then large enough to attract the interest of journalists who described in detailed articles the new public's passion for ants. In 1909, the French Academy of Sciences awarded him the Cuvier Prize[11] for the most remarkable work in zoology. Around 1900, Charles Janet was a recognized entomologist among zoologists and known to the general public. However, he conducted several research in many areas in parallel. His work consisted of over 4,000 pages of scientific articles. Today, Charles Janet is perceived either as a myrmecologist from the past or as an emerging chemist./nCharles Janet explored the Paris Basin and especially its chalk.[12] At the request of Edmond H\u00e9bert and his geology laboratory at the \u00c9cole Pratique des Hautes \u00c9tudes, he organized a geological excursion[13] around Beauvais for the students of the Sorbonne University and the MNHN. He quickly assembled a remarkable collection of fossil and prehistoric pieces. He estimated it contained around 50,000 items.[2] A large part of the collection includes fossils from regional deposits that have now disappeared or are almost inaccessible, such as the Bracheux Sands (partially covered by the expansion of the city of Beauvais). Charles Janet also developed a method for preserving the very fragile shells of these geological layers.[14] Other local Tertiary deposits are well represented, such as the Ypresian and Lutetian from the regions of Chaumont-en-Vexin, Parnes, Grignon, Chambors, and Mouy. The collection also includes numerous echinoderms, for which he co-wrote an article with Lucien Cu\u00e9not.[15] In the chalk of the Beauvais area, he discovered three new species of belemnites.[16] These are Actinocamax grossouvrei, Actinocamax toucasi, and Actinocamax alfridi.[17]/nJanet was particularly interested in social hymenoptera./nIn 1894, he observed a hornet's nest from its origin until the death of the last worker.[18] During these 5 months of uninterrupted observations, he discovered the trophallaxis of hornet larvae.[19][20] Continuing with insect ethology, he invented a vertical artificial nest that remained a classic tool for entomologists for a long time. This type of nest allowed him to understand how some insects live at the expense of ants. He surprised, for example, the silverfish stealing the droplet of sugary liquid exchanged between two ants.[21] He then performed in-depth studies on the internal anatomy of ants, where he endeavored to show their organization in metameres.[22] In the young ant queen, he discovered the transformation of flight muscles after she tore off her wings. He demonstrated that these muscles evolve into lipid cells, providing the necessary energy for this queen who does not feed during the long months it takes to establish her colony.[23]/nIn the end, 22 of the 24 notes he proposed to the French Academy of Sciences were related to social insects. He gradually sought to closely link ethology with insect physiology through histological sections, where some believe he did wonders.[5] Although he is still often cited as a classic author among entomologists, Charles Janet has been completely forgotten in his other research fields. About him, Maurice Maeterlinck wrote:/nIt is necessary to mention the engineer Charles Janet, whose countless studies, research, communications, monographs, precise, clear, impeccable, and adorned with anatomical plates that have become classics, have continued, for nearly fifty years, to enrich myrmecology as well as many other sciences. He is one of those great workers to whom justice is done only after their death.[24]/nThe shift towards botany is not an abandonment of zoology, but a broader reflection in which insects will be included. Building on his studies of insect metamerism, he then seeks to conceive a common ancestor for animals and plants. According to Janet, current metazoans would come from colonies of flagellated protozoa. This is why he believes that the only remaining links between the two kingdoms are those where animals and plants are still in a unicellular state. Charles Janet decides to study Volvox, as it has often been considered an intermediate between animals and plants, as well as between unicellular and multicellular organisms. For Janet, the Volvox,[25] which has not evolved since its divergence from phyto-flagellates, is therefore a living fossil that strongly recalls the beginnings of the animal kingdom./nHe is particularly interested in the successions of cellular development between two generations. A few years later, a theory called orthobiontics[26] will emerge, in which Janet outlines an organization plan for living beings. According to him, all extinct and current beings can be described by only 7 orthobiontic plans. In this synthesis where he bridges the gap between the animal and plant kingdoms, he will go as far as to completely mathematize his observations by formulating the observed cellular generations./nUltimately based on excessive theorization that takes precedence over his observations, undermined by a text filled with complex neologisms, all translated into mathematical language, this theory remained inaccessible. It was also extremely poorly received in the Revue g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Sciences pures et appliqu\u00e9es (General Review of Pure and Applied Sciences).[27]/nAt the age of 78, he undertakes research on atoms. He was interested in the properties of atoms and the organization of their nuclei. To synthesize his ideas, he reflects on a periodic classification of atomic elements.[28] For him, their physico-chemical properties are intimately linked to their arithmetic and graphical arrangement.[29]/nMoreover, the perfect regularity he observes at all levels of his table is, for Janet, proof that he has discovered the correct distribution law. In 1930, he even proposes to verify it by aligning his classification with the very recent quantum theory.[30] In doing so, he is the first to state the rule that describes the order in which electrons fill the subshells of an atom. This rule, later rediscovered, is commonly called the Madelung rule since 1936 among English speakers or the Klechkowski rule (of Soviet origin in 1962 and in use in France). Confidentially, Janet's classification will remain completely ignored in France. Thanks to these astonishing spiral figures, it will reappear 40 years later among American chemists[31] before a new eclipse. It has only been considered a valid alternative[32] to the famous Mendeleev's classification under the name of Left Step Table for about a decade. Eric Scerri, an American historian (UCLA), has popularized Janet's form in magazines such as Scientific American[33] or Pour la Science.[34] He also devotes an entire chapter of his latest work[35] to Charles Janet, whom he sees as a minor contributor in terms of fame, but major in terms of ideas./nJanet started from the fact that the series of chemical elements is a continuous sequence, which he represented as a helix traced on the surfaces of four nested cylinders. By various geometrical transformations he derived several striking designs, one of which is his \"left-step periodic table\", in which hydrogen and helium are placed above lithium and beryllium. It was only later that he realized that his arrangement agreed perfectly with quantum theory and the electronic structure of the atom. He placed the actinides under the lanthanides twenty years before Glenn Seaborg, and he continued the series to element 120./nJanet's table differs from the standard table in placing the s-block elements on the right, so that the subshells of the periodic table are arranged in the order (n \u2212 3)f, (n \u2212 2)d, (n \u2212 1)p, ns, from left to right. There is then no need to interrupt the sequence or move the f block into a 'footnote'. He believed that no elements heavier than number 120 would be found, so he did not envisage a g block. In terms of atomic quantum numbers, each row corresponds to one value of the sum (n + \u2113) where n is the principal quantum number and \u2113 the azimuthal quantum number. The table therefore corresponds to the Madelung rule, which states that atomic subshells are filled in the order of increasing values of (n + \u2113).  The philosopher of chemistry Eric Scerri has written extensively in favor of Janet's left-step periodic table, and it is being increasingly discussed as a candidate for the optimal or most fundamental form of the periodic table.[36]/nJanet also envisaged an element zero whose 'atom' would consist of two neutrons,[37] and he speculated that this would be the link to a mirror-image table of elements with negative atomic numbers \u2013 in effect anti-matter.

Armand Janet became renowned as a lepidopterist[5] and served as president of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 entomologique de France in 1911.[38] Armand Janet is also known as a caver and explorer[39] and was one of the first to explore the Verdon Gorge.[40]", "73517040": "Anne-Marie Chang is a researcher in the fields of sleep and circadian rhythms and is currently an Assistant Professor of Bio-behavioral Health at Pennsylvania State University.[1] She earned her Ph.D. in neuroscience from Northwestern University in 2003.[1]/nHer research focuses on the effects of sleep and circadian rhythms on cognitive and physical health. Chang's research emphasizes understanding health differences in response to sleep interruptions, such as loss of sleep. Through her research, Chang seeks to elucidate the genetic regulation, rhythm physiology, and rhythm behavior that underlies sleep and circadian rhythms in humans and mice. Her research has since expanded to include the interactions between sleep, circadian rhythms, and cardio-metabolic functions.[1]/nChang\u2019s early research focused on identifying genes that regulate circadian rhythms in mammals and their effects on sleep behavior. These studies pioneered experimental methods necessary for locating and mutating the murine Clock gene, which is now recognized as a central contributor to the mammalian circadian clock.[2] Further experiments revealed that mutating the Clock gene in mice reduced period gene expression and improved entrainment efficacy.[2]/nChang has made many research contributions related to sleep health, particularly relating to how adolescent health is related to sleep characteristics. Much of this work focuses on how sleep deprivation affects cognition and physiological outcomes. One such study found that sleep duration and quality are interrelated with screen time and depressive symptoms in adolescents.[3] The research team suggests that practices like limiting screen time before bedtime, reducing exposure to blue light, and establishing regular sleep routines are critical for adolescents\u2019 sleep health.[4] Another intervention that Chang and her team recommend to improve adolescent health is establishing a family routine to create a sleep-promoting environment and emphasize healthy sleep habits.[5] Her team has also found that shorter sleep duration and greater social jetlag are both associated with more anxious and depressive symptoms in adolescents.[6] These studies have highlighted the importance of adequate sleep duration and regular sleep schedules in promoting mental health by reducing adolescent anxiety as Chang found that short sleep duration and anxiety symptoms have a reciprocal relationship.[6]/nOther studies that Chang and her team have conducted have focused on delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS) and sleep timing. They have found that people with DSPS have a later sleep timing than their endogenous circadian rhythm and that bright light therapy and melatonin can help shift their circadian rhythms earlier, improving sleep health. Chang also determined that DSPS patients' symptoms could not be correlated to the phase relationship between sleep-wake patterns and circadian rhythms.[7] Chang also investigated the effects of light exposures on phase delays in the circadian rhythm of melatonin in humans. She found that there is strong evidence for a non-linear resetting response of the pacemaker to light duration.[8] This was further emphasized in her investigation in the use of light-emitting e-readers in the evening and its affects on sleep, circadian timing, and next-morning alertness. Chang found that evening exposure to eBooks cause phase delays in the circadian clock and suppresses melatonin, affecting sleep and health.[9]/nChang\u2019s work has also highlighted the impact that sleep deprivation has on collegiate athletes. Collegiate athletes with sleep deprivation experienced decreased reaction time, impaired decision-making, reduced endurance and strength, increased risk of injury, and impaired cognitive function, suggesting that sleep may be an important factor to consider in training and performance of collegiate athletes.[10]/nAdditionally, Chang has investigated how discrimination in the workplace relates to sleep quality - one example being that women who experienced discrimination in the workplace had poor sleep health.[11] Chang and her team also investigate how sex differences affect sleep health. They have found that the intrinsic circadian period in women is longer than in men. This finding is related to Chang's discovery that under identical sleep conditions, the melatonin and body temperature circadian rhythms in women occur earlier than in men by an average of one hour.[12]/nMuch of Chang\u2019s recent work explored how human sleep behaviors were affected by mutations in circadian genes. For example, mutations to the Per2 gene were associated with later chronotypes and varied levels of slow-wave sleep and REM sleep.[13][14] She discovered several circadian gene mutants that correlate with varied outcomes for sleep deprivation-related ailments and classified other genes as having little to no effect on sleep health.[15][16]/nChang has expanded her research in sleep science to include the implications of sleeping behaviors on cardiovascular and metabolic health. Her research also presented sleep\u2019s effect on metabolic health. For example, she studied the association between sleep and lipemic response, and she suggested the presence of association between sleep duration and hydration, and between sleep and BMI in adolescents.[17][18][19][20] She also found that sleep restriction effects visually and memory-guided force production magnitude and variability.[21] Moreover, she also concluded from her research that sleep health is associated with breakfast consumption, and thus poor sleep and bad dietary behaviors negatively impacts future metabolic health.[22] Chang\u2019s research supports the idea that inadequate sleep is positively associated with increases risk of metabolic disease[23]/nMuch of Chang's research reflects the correlation between sleep and circadian rhythm to social/individual well-being. Her investigations realized the differences of sleep durations among different age groups, ethnoracial groups, and between sexes, these researches presents socio-environmental significance, and will lead to further studies.[24]/nShe also researched the effects of second hand smoke exposure on children and their sleep duration. She found that second hand smoke exposure negatively impacts and has long-term consequences for childhood sleep durations.[25]", "66013172": "Lore Zech (1923\u20142013) was a German geneticist and cytogenetics researcher who made major contributions to the field of cytogenetics. Her research and discoveries paved the way for the identification of anomalies in chromosomes of diseased cells and eventually for many treatments and therapies for these diseases. Her notable works include her discovery of Q-banding and her research on leukemia and lymphoma./nZech was born in 1923 in G\u00fctersloh, Germany. Her grandmother raised her in Sauerland as Zech's parents died when she was 4 years old. From 1944 till after World War II, Zech studied medicine at the University of Marburg in Germany. Having left the medical field of study, Lore then picked up biology, chemistry, and physics at the University of Bonn and completed her doctoral thesis at the Max Planck Institute in T\u00fcbingen.[1] From 1953 till 1989, she worked at the Institute of Cell Research and Genetics at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden where most of her notable work was conducted alongside Torbj\u00f6rn Caspersson. She then dedicated her time at the University Hospital of Uppsala. At the University Hospital, she specifically committed her time to discussions on chromosome analysis at the Department of Medical Genetics, where she taught many research students. During her time as a researcher, Zech's colleagues described her as humorous and empathetic. Many established scientists and young researchers sought her advice and input on their own projects. In March 2013, Zech died from chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a disease she had conducted research on for many years.[1]/nZech's most prominent work was centered on human chromosomes. She conducted her research on human chromosomes alongside professor Torbj\u00f6rn Caspersson at the Karolinska Institute. Her research alongside Torbj\u00f6rn allowed her to create the first chromosome banding technique known as the quinacrine or Q-banding technique. This chromosome banding method proved to be one of the most important advancements to clinical cytogenetics.[1]/nAt the research institute, it was proven that DNA-binding fluorescent dyes could be used as a chromosome banding technique for plant chromosomes. Unlike many of her colleagues, Zech firmly believed that human chromosomes, similar to plant chromosomes, had different bands. Due to the department's beliefs against this idea, Zech worked on proving her theory correct in secret. She discovered that staining chromosomes with quinacrine makes the bands on the chromosome exhibit fluorescence when exposed to ultraviolet light.[2] This chromosome banding technique eventually became known as the Q-banding technique. With this technique, she discovered the first chromosome band in the Y-chromosome of a human cell.[1]/nAfter her discovery and the acceptance of the Q-banding technique by other scientists and medical professionals, Zech used the technique to find chromosome abnormalities in two types of blood cancer \u2013 leukemia and lymphoma. In collaboration with tumor biologist Georg Klein, Zech helped identify the chromosome abnormalities in tumor cells. This allowed for the future development of a targeted therapy for leukemia and lymphoma.[1]", "1460212": "Niles Eldredge (/\u02c8\u025bldr\u025bd\u0292/; born August 25, 1943) is an American biologist and paleontologist, who, along with Stephen Jay Gould, proposed the theory of punctuated equilibrium in 1972.[2][3][4][5][6]/nEldredge began his undergraduate studies in Latin at Columbia University.

The farm had been in the family since at least 1670, and probably since 1419./nAs a boy, Beament had a great love of music. His mother has been quoted as saying that he \"would wait for the Salvation Army band on Sundays, 'like a cat waiting for the fishmonger'\". she said. He was a scholarship student at Crewkerne Grammar School beginning in 1931./nWinning an Exhibition to read Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry at Queens' College, Cambridge, Beament went up in 1940. He studied under Alexander Wood, whose lectures and writings about the physics of sound led to a lifelong interest in acoustics. After having his first exposure to the work of classical composers, Beament taught himself to read music. He also founded Queens' College's amateur dramatic society, the Bats./nIt was wartime, and Beament was obliged to join the 8th Cambridge Home Guard. On the suggestion of C. P. Snow, he devoted his third year at Cambridge to zoology, with a focus on insects./nHe received a B.A. and M.A. from Cambridge in 1943, earning a First. He then proceeded to the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (later the London School of Tropical Medicine, LSTM), where an older colleague, Vincent Wigglesworth, \"told him that more people had died in the First World War from insect-borne diseases than had been killed in action\" and that his assignment would be \"to find out how to permeate insect skins\", which were covered in a thin layer of wax. \"Wigglesworth stimulated [Beament's] interest in the wetting and waterproofing properties of the insect integument or cuticle, a topic that was to be a dominant theme in his scientific career\", according to one source./nBeament's research into this question led to five major scientific publications in which he showed how poisons could be introduced into insects. He also worked with the head of the LSTM, P. A. Buxton, on lice, which played a major role in transmitting typhus on the Eastern front. In addition, he played a role in DDT experiments that confirmed the ability of DDT to kill lice, and that helped prevent a typhus epidemic in Naples in 1944. Since Beament's and Wigglesworth's research required large numbers of lice, Beament, to keep them alive, \"went around with aluminium tins tucked inside his socks 16 hours a day with the lice feeding off himself which just about kept up with the experimental demand\".[3]/nWhen Wigglesworth moved to Cambridge to become a Reader in Entomology and to run the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) Unit of Insect Physiology, Beament accepted an invitation to join him there while continuing to work in London on his PhD on insect eggs. He received the PhD in 1946./nAfter receiving his PhD, Beament remained at Cambridge, where he worked on fly, tick, and red spider mite eggs and made a number of important discoveries. In 1955 he resumed research on insect waxes and waterproofing./nIn 1960 he submitted his Cambridge Sc.D., which consisted of four large papers, two reviews, and a letter to Nature. In the same year, he organised the second SEB Symposium and chose \"Biological Receptor Mechanisms\" as the theme.

Although \"some of the older Fellows of Queens' had thought him a bit too unorthodox to fit the staid collegiate culture,\" they \"soon realized the immense value that he added to the Fellowship,\" given the ease with which he dealt with students. Long an advocate of integrating courses in related subjects, such as zoology, botany, and genetics, Beament helped design an integrated course \"that in essence survived within the Natural Sciences Tripos well into the following century\"./nIn 1968, at the request of the Royal Society, Beament went to Ghana to advise that country's government on the effective utilisation of Lake Volta./nAt Cambridge, Beament held the title of Principal Scientific Officer at the ARC from 1946 to 1960 and was named a Lecturer in Zoology in 1961. He was appointed Reader in Insect Physiology in 1966, and Drapers Professor of Agriculture and Chairman of the Department of Agriculture in 1969. His mandate was to convert the Department of Agriculture into a Department of Applied Biology, in fulfilment of recommendations he had made himself in a report to the university./nHe received a knighthood in 1980, and retired from Cambridge in 1989.[3][4][5]/nHe continued to work, however. He studied the acidification of lakes in his role as Chairman of the Biological Research Advisory Committee of the Central Electricity Generating Board, and concluded that the problem was not caused mainly by acid rain, as was then generally believed, but chiefly by organic acids produced by the decay of moss and of pine tree litter, a problem that was quickly resolved. This finding received insufficient public attention because \"it was not what the media wanted to hear\".[3][4]/nHe also worked on a project that resulted in a preservative coating for bananas allowing them to be transported without refrigeration. In addition, he researched the pollination process. In his last papers, he returned to the subject of insect eggs, discovering that \"Culex mosquito eggs fitted together like Lego bricks\"./nWhile working in the Department of Applied Biology, Beament also taught courses in acoustics under the auspices of the Music Department. After retiring from the Advisory Research Committee in 1989, Beamont wrote The Violin Explained (1997), in which he provided scientific explanations of the workings of that instrument.[4] The Strad, reviewing The Violin Explained, said that it provided \"a comprehensive look at what is known about the mechanics of the violin family\", explained in \"a very readable and non-mathematical style...the nature of sound production\", and \"confront[ed] the question of tone assessment\".[6] A colleague described the book as \u201caddress[ing] the age-old problems of string tension, glue and varnish\".[3] After writing The Violin Explained, he gave a series of lectures on the topic, including one to the British Violin Makers Association in 1999./nBeament then wrote How We Hear Music (2001), in which he explained the human response to harmony.[4] According to a colleague, he had been thinking about writing such a book \"ever since he had met von B\u00e9k\u00e9sy in 1961\".

The response of the classic musical world to his first string sextet, according to one colleague, \"probably gave him more pleasure than any of his scientific publications\".[3]/nAfter Beament's death, a colleague called him a \"polymath\" with \"extraordinary energy\" who over the course of his career was driven by \"two dominant scientific passions\", namely \"insect physiology and the mechanism of hearing (and psychoacoustics)\". Beament's research field, the colleague wrote, \"remained very much his own....Jimmie never had time for research that needed the newest, biggest or most expensive bits of kit. Rather he preferred to choose problems that had never been solved because the means of attacking the problem did not exist\". Consequently, Beament and his collaborators \"designed and built innovative, specialized equipment \u2013 he was a precision engineer as well as a scientist\".[3]/nBeament was chief editor of the Journal of Agricultural Science from 1970 to 1989, and edited multiple volumes of Advances in Insect Physiology.[5]/nBeament married his first wife, Monica, during the war, and she returned to Cambridge with him, but they were divorced in the early 1950s. He met his second wife, Joyce Quinney, in a theatre group at Cambridge after his return there in 1947; she went on to play leading roles in several productions by the Bats. She died in 1960. On 18 June 1962 he was married a third time, to Sara Juliet Barker, a violin maker who later wrote a book entitled Violin Making. They met through the Cambridge Technical College orchestra, in which she played the viola and he played the double bass. They had two children, Thomas and Christopher./nBeament devoted a great deal of his life to amateur music and theatre productions.

The twentieth century was marked by the discovery of genetic determinisms of development, in particular the genes that define the cellular position information in an embryo, i.e. their spatial coordinates. In 1995-1998, Thomas Lecuit worked on a general way of organizing positional information by so-called morphogenic factors. Morphogens were first proposed by the mathematician Alan Turing in 1954, as factors organizing form according to purely physico-chemical principles of reaction-diffusion.[5] Lewis Wolpert[6] in 1969 and Francis Crick[7] in 1971 proposed a more precise definition, as factors that form a concentration gradient at the origin of positional information. Thomas Lecuit shows that the growth factors of the BMP/Dpp and Wg/Wnt families are morphogens, acting at a distance, whose local concentration constitutes positional information that spatially organizes cell identity and limb axes.[8][9][10] He focuses his attention on the close relationship between positional information and tissue growth from a dynamic point of view./nFrom 1998 onwards, as fluorescence imaging in living organisms develops, Thomas Lecuit studies the cellular basis of developmental dynamics.

His research includes characterization of the physical principles of morphogenesis, along the lines of the work begun by d'Arcy Thompson in On Growth and Form (1917).[13] His team first discovered the nature of the mechanical forces that cause tissue plasticity, namely the contractile forces that reshape the shape and cellular interactions[14][15][16][17] and their division.[18] They also study the nature of cohesive forces through intercellular adhesion.[19][20] Contractile forces are organized in space and time and are polarized in privileged directions. Several articles reveal how embryonic position information orchestrates cell mechanics in space and time.[14][21] This work is discussed in a broader perspective in several journals.[22][23]/nSince 2010, Thomas Lecuit and his colleagues have been highlighting the limits of a tradition that has largely seen development as the strict execution of a deterministic program governed by hierarchically regulated genes.  Several studies[24][25][26] indicate that it is also appropriate to consider statistical laws of organization, without hierarchy but with many feedbacks of a mechano-chemical nature.

Known as the Institute of Ultra Pure Biochemical Preparations, it was to work on the Yersinia pestis strain of the plague.[1] The laboratory actually began operating in 1981, and over the next two years Pasechnik realised that, far from running a civilian research operation dedicated to vaccine development, as he had been promised, he had become part of a vast network of laboratories and factories involved in a massive BW program.\nAccording to Pasechnik, the Institute, which had a staff of about 400, did research on modifying cruise missiles to spread the plague. The weapons system was to operate by flying low to avoid early-warning systems and use robot craft to spray clouds of aerosolised pathogens over unsuspecting enemies. The team succeeded in producing an aerosolised version of the plague microbe that could survive outside a lab. This version of the organism was genetically-engineered to be resistant to antibiotics./nIn the mid-1980s, Pasechnik became increasingly dissatisfied.

We expect that this type of analysis will be useful for finding low-frequency variants associated with many complex traits, including obesity or cancer.\"[5]/nHer research goals include identifying genetic loci responsible for genetic diseases; identifying important locations within these loci for testing; and understanding the functional mechanisms express these genes as physical characteristics.[6]", "54020166": "Boris Mikhailovich Kozo-Polyansky (Russian: \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0439\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u043e\u0437\u043e-\u041f\u043e\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439; 20 January 1890 \u2013 21 April 1957) was a Soviet and Russian botanist and evolutionary biologist, best known for his seminal work, Symbiogenesis: A New Principle of Evolution, which was the first work to place the theory of symbiogenesis into a Darwinian evolutionary context, as well as one of the first to redefine cell theory.[1]/nBoris Kozo-Polyansky was born in Ashgabat, which at the time was part of the Russian Empire. He relocated to Voronezh in his early youth.[2] He graduated from Moscow University in 1914 at the age of 24, before returning to Voronezh where he worked as an assistant at Voronezh Agricultural University until 1918. In 1920 he then became a professor at Voronezh State University, where he taught for the remainder of his life and served as a Dean, Chair of Botany and Vice President of the University.[1] He is buried in Voronezh at the Comintern Cemetery\u00a0[ru]./nBoris Kozo-Polyansky became a professor of botany at the University of Voronezh in 1920. His research and contribution to the field mostly focused on the phylogenetic taxonomy and morphology of higher plants. His research expounded upon and supported the euanthial origin of flowers (flowers coming from a shoot with modified leaves) and from this theory, he constructed an original phylogenetic system for angiosperms, and later for all terrestrial plant life.[2] Additionally, He devised a new classification of umbellifers based on the anatomy of their fruit. Furthermore, during studies he conducted in the Timskaia Highland in Kursk Oblast, Kozo-Polyansky discovered an accumulation of relict plants.[2]/nKozo-Polyansky published \"Introduction to the phylogenetic systematics of higher plants\",[3] \"Tea plants of Kazakhstan\", and \"The main biogenetic law from the botanical point of view\" during his lifetime, and a fourth book on botany, \"Course in the Systematics of Higher Plants\", was published posthumously./nKozo-Polyansky became the director of the Voronezh Botanical Gardens in 1937, which today are named in his honor.[4]/nSymbiogenesis, the theory which describes the endosymbiotic origin of Eukaryotic cells, which endocytosed smaller prokaryotes that later became DNA containing organelles such as mitochondria and plastids, was first suggested by Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper (1856 \u20131901) in his 1883 seminal paper: \u201cOn the development of chlorophyll grains and color bodies.\u201d[5] However, the theory wasn't detailed in a substantial manner until Konstantin Mereschkowski (1855\u20131921) published his 1905 paper, \"The nature and origins of chromatophores in the plant kingdom,\" where the term Symbiogenesis was first coined.[6] It was in this academic landscape that Kozo-Polyansky pioneered the idea that symbiogenesis could be explained through the classical Darwinian notion of evolution, something his two predecessors failed to do. He first publicly related this theory in 1921 at the All Russian Congress of Russian Botanists in Petrograd./nTheory of symbiogenesis and ''Pangenesis, a Provisional Hypothesis.''\" \n\"My presentation will contain the following new statements (when compared to the \"Symbiogenesis\" brochure that I previously distributed to the participants of the Congress):/n(1) The state Linnaeus and most biologist: ''Natura non facit saltum'' [N''ature does not make leaps''] is not correct since formation from two (or more) organisms of a third is a leap. ''Natura facit saltum'' [''Nature does make leaps'']/n(2) Therefore, searches for intermediate forms, missing links [these two words given in English - Ed.], in many cases will be completely fruitless. Transitions are not possible between two (or more) components and their sum [a new life form]./n(3) Representations of Origin [of a new life form] as a true [branching] tree are incorrect since the origins of a new organisms occur not only by divergence of the lineages but also by their convergence and fusion: two (or more) branches fuse [anastomose] and produce a summary issue (alga + fungus = lichen)./n(4) Production of new forms of organisms through symbiogenesis reflects the way in which new forms are produced by the elements: two gases unite and form a liquid; two liquids form a solid residue; iron and sulfur form crystals resembling neither iron nor sulfur. The new [life form] is a result of [a permanent] combination of [two or more different] old [life forms]./nBoris Kozo-Polyansky, The New Principle of Biology- An Essay on the Theory of Symbiogenesis./nYet, it wasn't until 1924, through the publication of Kozo-Polyansky's seminal work \"The New Principle of Biology: An Essay on the Theory of Symbiogenesis,\" that the evolutionary context and importance of symbiogenesis was fully detailed for the first time.[7]/nIn \"The New Principle of Biology: An Essay on the Theory of Symbiogenesis\" Kozo-Polyansky posited many novels theories and observations that had yet been developed by other biologists.[7] The novel views that he proposed in the text, are the following:/nIt was not the drive toward the division of labor that led to the formation of these organoids, but the fact that certain partners joined the system that made a specific scheme of labor division possible./nBoris Kozo-Polyansky, The New Principle of Biology- An Essay on the Theory of Symbiogenesis./nKozo-Polyansky ultimately posited that symbiogenesis was a source of evolutionary novelty and that Darwinian mechanisms, such as natural selection, were responsible for maintaining the heritable changes brought about by symbiotic interactions./nAt the time of the publication of Kozo-Polyansky's theory and work on evolution and symbiogenesis, was ridiculed and rejected, and was never recognized for its merit during his lifetime.[1] And due to the language barrier of Russian, was never read in the West, where English and German evolutionary works dominated the academic landscape.[7] However, the works of other symbiogeneticists and Kozo-Polyansky were brought back into academic consciousness in 1967 by the work of Lynn Margulis who independently proposed a near identical theory to Kozo-Polyansky's.[1] With the revival of evolutionary symbiogenesis, Margulis was made aware of Kozo-Polyansky's work by a former student of his, Armen Takhtajan at the 1975 International Conference of Botany. Kozo-Polyansky's theories were first published to the West in 1979 by Khakhina's book on the history of the theory of symbiogenesis.[8] However, the entirety of his original book was not translated into English until 2010 by Victor Fet, and Lynn Margulis.[7][9]/nToday, his views are held to be correct by nearly the entire biological sciences community, and is regarded as one of the first thinkers to detail the endosymbiotic evolution of eukaryotic cells, the theory of punctuated equilibrium and the distinction between prokaryotic and eukaryotic life forms.[10][11] A special issue of the journal BioSystems (2021) \"Symbiogenesis and Progressive Evolution\" is dedicated to Boris Kozo-Polyansky and Lynn Margulis./nIntroduction to the phylogenetic systematics of higher plants, Voronezh, 1922[2][12][3]/nNew principle of biology.

During World War II, he accompanied his parents to Egypt, South Africa, and finally the United States (U.S.), where his father held ministerial posts in the Greek Government in exile. The family stayed in the U.S. until 1944, when, following the liberation of Greece after the defeat of Nazi Germany, they returned permanently to Greece. \nAfter his secondary education at the 8th Gymnasium of Athens, he graduated from the Medical School of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in 1956. After completion of Army service he joined the team of Prof. Peter Karlson at the Institut f\u00fcr Physiologische Chemie of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. He completed his doctoral degree in biochemistry in 1962 from the Medical School of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich./nIn 1964 Sekeris accompanied Karlson when he moved to the position of Director of the Institut f\u00fcr Physiologische Chemie of the Philipps University of Marburg. In 1966 he became a Privatdozent at the Medical School where, in 1970, he was promoted to \u201cWissenschaftlicher Rat und Professor\u201d, and then to a C3 Professor. In 1974 he moved to the German Cancer Research Centre (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum) in Heidelberg as the Head of the Section \u201cMolecular Biology of the Cell\u201d and a professor at the Science Faculty of Heidelberg University. In 1977, he finally moved home to Greece as a Professor of Biochemistry at the University of Athens, first at the Department of Biology and then (1993) at the Medical School. During his tenure at the University of Athens he held a joint appointment at the Institute of Biological Research at the National Hellenic Research Foundation, serving as its Director. In 2000, he reached the mandatory retirement age for the Greek Public Service, but kept performing research, unofficially, up until his death in 2009./nSekeris\u2019 main research interest was the mode of action of steroid hormones. He started his research working on tyrosine metabolism in insects and then rapidly moved to molecular endocrinology, where he stayed. Building on the work of Adolf_Butenandt (Karlson's father-in-law and director of the Munich Institute), Karlson and Sekeris early on proposed a model on how steroids function,[1] which was very loosely based on Jacob and Monod's model for the regulation of the lactose operon of Escherichia coli. He concentrated his later work on steroid receptor(s) including the binding of glucocorticoid receptor to mitochondrial DNA,[2] which he and his group first described. His overall focus could be described as the elucidation of the role of glucocorticoids in the regulation of gene expression and cellular metabolism. This research led to research on post-transcriptional events such as mRNA processing. He was the first to describe the presence of small RNA species involved in the processing of hnRNA. He published more than 250 papers [3] and book chapters, making him one of Greece's most prolific scientists in non-clinical life sciences./nIn addition to his long-term directorship of the Institute of Biological Research at the National Hellenic Research Foundation, Sekeris was involved in science administration both in Greece and abroad. He was a member of the Greek Research Council and acted as the Chief Executive Officer of the National Hellenic Research Foundation. Among different honours that he received during his career one should mention his election to the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) and the European Academy of Sciences. After leaving Germany he was made an Honorary Professor of Cell Biology at the Science Faculty of Heidelberg University./nSekeris was a direct descendant of Panagiotis Sekeris, a merchant and ship owner who lived in Constantinople in the early 19th century and co-founded the Filiki Eteria (a secret society aiming to overthrow the Ottoman rule in Greece), and who spent his entire wealth financing this process. Sekeris married Lioka (Kalliope), born Platsouka (passed away in 1997) and then Evi, born Protopappa.

V. Chalam, also known as Guduru Venkata Chalam (1909\u20131967),[1] was an Indian activist and agricultural scientist who received the Padma Shri in 1967.[2]/nGuduru Venkatachalam (a.k.a. G.V. Chalam) was born to an affluent family in 1909 in Gudivada, a town in the heart of Andhra Pradesh, India. At the time of his father's death, G.V. Chalam was only eight years old. He was brought up by his paternal uncle, Guduru Ramachandra Rao \u2013 a Gandhian and a pioneer social reformer who convened the first Adi Andhra Mahajana Sabha in 1917 for the emancipation of the so-called  'untouchable' castes, Malas and Madigas of Andhra Pradesh (now known as Dalits).[1] Archived 13 April 2016 at the Wayback Machine/nG V Chalam had his early education in Gudivada and Rajamundry and later continued his\nundergraduate studies P.R. Raja College in Kakinada./nInspired by his uncle, G V Chalam soon became involved in contemporary social reforms and became a leading member of a Society (known as Sodara \u2018Samajam\u2019) which had as its goal the establishment of an egalitarian society transcending caste, creed, and religion. G.V. Chalam was fired by patriotic zeal and threw himself into national struggle for freedom from British colonial rule. As a graduate student, Chalam was caught distributing seditious \u2018anti British\u2019 literature by the police and was imprisoned for 14 months in the Vellore jail, in then Madras province, India./nDespite this setback (due to imprisonment) to his studies, Chalam continued his postgraduate  education at the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) and was awarded a first class master's degree in botany. Following a short stint at the newly formed Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), Chalam joined the Agriculture Department, Orissa Government as a research assistant in the Central Rice Research Institute, Cuttack. As a research assistant, Chalam carried out special work on the taxonomy of the rice and obtained his doctorate from the Patna University in 1943 (the first PhD degree on Anatomy of Rice in Agricultural Botany in the states of Bihar and Orissa). As a rice researcher, Chalam was responsible for evolving a number of important varieties of rice which became a household name in Orissa, like T-1145, T-141 and T-1242. He evolved a saline resistant variety of rice, SR 26B which now occupies the entire East Coast and parts of West Coast of India, Ceylon and some South-East Asian Countries./nIn his capacity as Assistant Director of Director of Agriculture for Land Reclamation and Seed Multiplication, he established two very large sized farms after reclaiming the forest areas. The two farms are now known as the Sukinda farm and Deras farm contributed nearly 50 percent of the total seed production in Orissa in 1967. In 1954, as the Paddy Specialist of Orissa Government, Chalam participated in Food and Agriculture Organization Hybridization Scheme and commenced research work of the Japonica Indica hybrids. As a result of his untiring efforts, several promising hybrids came into being and a comprehensive monograph called 'Rice in Orissa' was published by the Orissa Government which was presented to the International Rice Commission. At a time when the raising of a second crop was unknown to the farmers, through his inventiveness, Chalam introduced several new crop varieties and popularised the raising of second crop in the command area of the newly created Hirakud Dam./nIn November 1960, Chalam was head hunted to join the Ministry of Food and Agriculture in the Union Government as the Deputy Agricultural Commissioner. In this capacity, he organised several seed production and training programmes in the country in collaboration with the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations. Chalam was one of the main draftsmen of the Seed Law for India which came to be known National Seed Act (1966). In 1963, Chalam was appointed as the first general manager of the National Seeds Corporation and established the first ever chain of Breeder-Foundation\u2014Certified seed farms in India to produce high quality seeds to the farmers. This was the beginning of the certified seed programme which was to play a key role in ushering the Green Revolution in India in the late 60s. Dr. Chalam was the first Member-Secretary of the Central Variety Release Committee which is the forerunner of the Statutory Central Seed Committee./nAfter the expiry of his term as the general manager of the National Seeds Corporation, Chalam was appointed to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) in 1964. On his way back from attending an International Seed Testing Seminar in New Zealand, Chalam visited the International Rice Research Institute at Manila of his own initiative and expense and selected the Taichung Native-I (TN-1) [2] as one of the most promising Indica varieties that could thrive in India.[3] Chalam could get only one kilogram of seed of this variety and with the approval of the ICAR, he carried out trials at four places which gave outstanding results beyond all expectations.[3] This brought new vistas in rice production in India. Despite criticism by many Indian agricultural scientists and scepticism of United Nations agencies and the World Bank officials regarding the characteristics of the variety and the ability of the Indian farmers to embrace new cultivation techniques, Chalam was undeterred and carried out trials of TN-1 in many small farms, mainly in the states of Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Western Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab./nTN-1 proved to be an outstanding variety. At a time, when yields of 6000 to 7,000\u00a0lb (3,200\u00a0kg). per acre were a rare occurrence, with TN-1 it became a common occurrence in India. As one who introduced this high yielding variety in the country, Chalam successfully sponsored the release of TN-1 before the statutory Central Variety Release Committee in January 1966. Later he carried on an intensive seed production programme of TN-I in about 11,000 acres (45\u00a0km2) in the second crop season of 1965\u201368 and made it possible to supply the seed for planting one million acres (4,000\u00a0km\u00b2) for 'Kharif' (crop season during June\u2013December) in 1966. Thus, beginning with one kilogram of seed of TN-I, Chalam built up a huge stock of certified seed for one million acres (4,000\u00a0km\u00b2) which, even though considered as an impossible venture at one time, had become a practical achievement./nUnfortunately 1965 was the year when India was affected by very severe drought conditions.  Large-scale food shortages were imminent. Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri coined the slogan Jai Jawan Jai Kisan to encourage the farmers to produce more and at the same time called upon the countrymen to miss one meal every week to conserve the dwindling food supplies./nAt a time when there was widespread despair amongst the farming community, Chalam persuaded the farmers to cultivate drought resistant TN-1 and staved off what certainly would have been another catastrophic famine in India./nDr. Chalam rejoined the National Seeds Corporation as its managing director. Although Chalam became well known for the propagation of TN-1 rice, Chalam also played a key role in facilitating the introduction and popularisation of high yielding 'Mexican' dwarf wheat varieties and hybrid maize and groundnut varieties into India. During his stewardship, the National Seeds Corporation of India became a model public sector undertaking both for achieving financial results and for achievement of long-term social objectives.\nIn recognition of this enduring contribution to agricultural development of the country, Dr Chalam was awarded Padma Shri in April 1967 by the Government of India./nUnfortunately a month later, on 8 May 1967, Dr G V Chalam suddenly died following a heart attack leaving behind a wife and eight children./nThe Government of India released a commemorative stamp on 8 May 2010./nChalam had a flair for writing and was fluent in Telugu, English and Oriya. During his imprisonment as a student, Chalam wrote a collection of highly perceptive short stories about life in prison. Some of these stories were later published in the contemporary leading Telugu magazine, Krishna Patrika. Despite not being a mainstream academic for much of his professional life, Chalam was the author of 40 scientific papers and several popular science articles. He was awarded Kavikokila prize for extending scientific agriculture to the farmers through his popular book on rice cultivation, VARI SAGU ' a book much appreciated by the farmers in Andhra Pradesh.

Her fields of research were cytology, genetics, and embryology. She was among the first women to be elected to political office in Norway. She suggested the epic voyage of her graduate student Thor Heyerdahl on the raft Kon-tiki, a voyage memorialized in the Kon-Tiki Museum, Oslo.[1]/nShe was the fifth of seven children born to Anne Johanne Daae (1839\u20131876) and her husband Jacob Aall Bonnevie (1838\u20131904), a member of the Norwegian parliament. She was baptized on 8 November 1872 at V\u00e5r Frue Church (Our Lady's Church) in Trondheim, part of the Church of Norway and previously Catholic. Anne died when Kristine was four, and Jacob married Susanne Byrne (1848\u20131927), having two more children (his eighth and ninth) with her.[2] Kristine's half-brother from this second marriage was Carl Bonnevie, also a conservative member of Parliament and a peace activist.[3] Kristine's family moved from Trondhjem to Kristiania in 1886.[4]/nAlthough her father was an educator, and in many respects a pioneer in that field, he generally opposed women's education, contending that girls should be educated at home in small groups organized by the mothers.[5][6][7] There were also few options for educating girls in 19th-century Norway.[8] Girls typically went to the equivalent of finishing schools that lacked academic focus.[9] Despite her father's concern about women's education and her limited opportunities, both she and her older sister Honoria were able to attend a private school to prepare to pass a gymnasium exam, the European secondary system for academic education. She passed the exam and also her pre-graduate examen artium (simultaneously the final exam of Latin high school and the college entrance exam) with distinction in 1892.[10]/nIn 1884, Norway became the last Scandinavian country to admit women to universities.[11] She entered the University of Kristiania (now the University of Oslo) as a medical student in 1892.[12] She began her studies in medicine, a field to which most women were encouraged out of the belief that they were good caretakers.[13] Medicine didn't suit her, but Zoology was part of preclinical medical training, so she soon switched to it, studying under professors Johan Hjort and Georg Ossian Sars. Sars was the brother of historian Ernst Sars, with whom he shared a house, and she attended salons at their home discussing ideas such as John Stuart Mill's The Subjection of Women (1869), arguing that the \"subordination of one sex to the other\" is \"wrong in itself, and now one of the chief hindrances to human improvement.\"[14] She was so well received by these scholars that eventually they gave her a research stipend that enabled her to quit teaching and focus on her studies.[15]/nShe developed an expertise in marine biology, working on materials from the Norwegian North Sea expedition of 15 years prior.[16] In 1898 she received a grant to study cytology at the University of Z\u00fcrich with professor Arnold Lang.[17] She felt thwarted in Zurich, however, when Lang or the team rejected her research proposals.[18] Instead she applied for a position back in Norway, taking over a position professor Hjort relinquished as curator of the Zoological Museum at the University of Oslo, and for which professor Sars was the selector. To the surprise of many, even though she was one of two finalists with a highly qualified man who slightly surpassed her in education (Kristian Schreiner), Sars chose her. She succeeded Hjort as curator in 1900. Schreiner's dismay at the loss of the post would soon figure in the arc of her career.[19][20]/nShe received another grant to study with German embryologist Theodor Boveri at the University of W\u00fcrzburg, focusing on cytology and cell biology, and she went there in 1900, just two months after her appointment as curator. Her research considered meiosis in different species of invertebrates that included the intestinal roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides, and she discovered an anomalous model that differed from the assumed universal process in cell division.[21] This research became the basis of her 1906 doctoral dissertation, \"Unders\u00f8gelser over kimcellerne hos Enteroxenos \u00f8stergreni\" (studies on the germ cells of Enteroxenos \u00f8stergreni). Upon graduation, she was the second woman to earn a doctorate at a Norwegian university, and the first in science.[22]/nShe spent two postdoctoral semesters at Columbia University from 1906 to 1907, studying with zoologist and embryologist Edmund B. Wilson, analyzing sex chromosomes.[21] In June of 1907 Schreiner published a paper arguing that the discovery upon which she had based her entire dissertation was invalid.[23] She worried that he was out to \"demolish her,\" but few understood the argument well enough to engage it, and eventually the controversy blew over.[24]/nAt the time, Norwegian law prohibited women from holding state-funded faculty positions, but she applied for and received a privately funded \"extraordinary\" (outside of the standard faculty) professorship in zoology at the University of Bergen in 1910. Her colleagues Sars and Robert Collett lobbied for that position, along with Haaken Hasberg Gran, and later influenced Parliament to pass the \"Lex Bonnevie\" on February 9, 1912. This act granted women the same right as men to hold positions as professors at Norwegian universities. In 1912 Bonnevie became the first female professor in Norway, initially as extraordinary professor, but from 1919 on as full professor.[25] She was a professor at Royal Frederick University from 1912 to 1937./nIn 1914, Bonnevie began researching genetics and hereditary abnormalities. She was especially interested in whether twin births could be hereditary. She told an interviewer at Barnard College that Norway was a good place to study human heredity, because at that time its people live in isolated communities. She cited inbreeding among families that could be traced back hundreds of years.[26]/nIn a rundown of discoveries and contributions, she proved polydactyly had a clear hereditary component.[7] She also studied fingerprints to see if they had some hereditary components, with an early interest in paternity cases. She later researched a possible connection between fingerprints and mental capabilities - a popular idea during an era when eugenics controversies were active. Her results showed no relation between fingerprints and IQ.[7] Finally, she studied a genetic dysfunction in mice that made them twitch, proving it was hereditary and caused by the accumulation of water in the brain.[7]/nEven after her retirement in 1937, she kept conducting research. Her last article was accepted for publication the day before she died in 1948, at 76 years old. This article is still cited.[27]/nBetween 1922 and 1933, Bonnevie contributed to the Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations (with Henri Bergson, Albert Einstein, Marie Curie and others).[28]/nKristine Bonnevie never had children of her own, but she cared a great deal about student welfare. She was also interested in supporting young female scientists. She was a founder of the student canteens Aulakjelleren and Blindernkjelleren at the University of Oslo. Thanks to her support, beginning in 1916 the university created several residences for female students in Oslo. Some years later, in 1920, she became a founder of the Association of University Women, and she was its first president. As president she hosted the Third International Congress of the Federation of University Women, held in 1924 in Oslo./nDuring World War I, she offered food and shelter to students from other parts of Norway. She even rented fields to grow vegetables, and she distributed food from her apartment to students after the Nazis closed the university in 1943.[21] Both had been caught up in the racist aspects of eugenics, and her earlier professional rival Kristian Schreiner suffered for not cooperating with Nazis.

The character first appeared in Astonishing Tales #6 in 1971 as a supporting character and eventual love interest of Ka-Zar, with a Ph.D in biology. She is soon revealed to be the highly trained Agent 19 of S.H.I.E.L.D., taking the moniker Huntress in Marvel Super Action #1 in 1976, and Mockingbird in Marvel Team-Up #95 in 1980, before going on to be a member of several Avengers teams, briefly marrying and subsequently divorcing Clint Barton / Hawkeye.[2]/nMockingbird has been described as one of Marvel's most notable and powerful female heroes.[3][4][5]/nIn media set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Bobbi Morse appeared in the second and third seasons of the television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2014\u20132016), portrayed by Adrianne Palicki, while the role of Agent 19 of S.H.I.E.L.D. is adapted to Laura Barton, portrayed by Linda Cardellini in the 2015 film Avengers: Age of Ultron and the Disney+ series Hawkeye (2021)./nThe character first appears as Barbara Morse in the Ka-Zar story in Astonishing Tales #6 (June 1971) written by Gerry Conway and pencilled by Barry Smith. The earliest story to be written and drawn (by Len Wein and Neal Adams) featuring the character was intended to appear in Savage Tales #2 (July 1971), but the series was canceled (a #2 and subsequent series appeared much later) and new homes were found for the stories in the ensuing months. In subsequent publications, creators including Roy Thomas, Len Wein, Neal Adams, Mike Friedrich, Archie Goodwin, George Evans, Steven Grant, and Mark Gruenwald made significant contributions to the development of the character./nAfter appearing in the 1983 Hawkeye mini-series, Mockingbird became a founding member of the West Coast Avengers, appearing in the group's initial self-titled mini-series, followed by regular appearances in the group's ongoing monthly series, until its end in 1994./nMockingbird appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010\u20132013 New Avengers series, from issue #1 (August 2010) through its final issue #34 (January 2013). She also co-starred in the 2010 series Hawkeye & Mockingbird, which ran for 6 issues. Mockingbird became a regular character in the 2013 Secret Avengers series by Nick Spencer and Luke Ross.[6]/nIn September 2015, Mockingbird starred in the one-shot Mockingbird: S.H.I.E.L.D. 50th Anniversary #1 by writer Chelsea Cain and artist Jo\u00eblle Jones.[7] That November, Marvel announced the launch of her first ongoing series by Cain and artist Kate Niemczyk in March 2016.[8] It was canceled after eight issues due to poor sales,[9] despite receiving critical acclaim.[10]/nThe character who later becomes Mockingbird first appears in a short sequence in Astonishing Tales #6 (June 1971) in which a frantic young brunette arrives at the English country estate of Lord Kevin Plunder (who is also known as \"Ka-Zar\"). Encountering the butler, she exclaims, \"Lord Kevin Plunder where is he? I must speak with him! 'tis a matter\u2014of the fate of worlds!\" In a brief second appearance in the same issue, the character claims that \"Lord Kevin Plunder and I have never met\u2014and yet I feel that I know him...You see, I can\u2014can 'feel' people in my mind! And I know that unless I speak with him\u2014Lord Kevin will die!\"[11] Subsequent creators continued to develop the character, and no later story makes reference to any psychic abilities./nAfter this story, Roy Thomas took over writing the Ka-Zar strip and in his first story the as-yet-unnamed character makes another brief appearance. The butler at Ka-Zar's estate informs her that his employer is currently in the Savage Land. The girl then vows to \"walk the Savage Land\" for \"[Ka-Zar's] sake and the sake of the world\".[12]/nIn Astonishing Tales #8 (Oct. 1971), Thomas is joined by co-writer Gary Friedrich and the character begins to develop\u2014her hair color changes to blonde without explanation and her name is given as \"Barbara\".[13] In this issue, Ka-Zar comes upon the site of a plane crash in the Savage Land and encounters a survivor. This man explains that he and his fianc\u00e9e Barbara flew to the Savage Land seeking Ka-Zar. He mentions that Barbara learned of Ka-Zar's whereabouts from the butler at the Plunder Estate, clearly indicating that Barbara is meant to be the same character as the brunette from the previous two issues. Barbara is shown later in the story; having parachuted from the plane before the crash, she is rescued by a group of World War II veterans who have been trapped in the Savage Land for decades./nGerry Conway briefly returned to co-write (with Roy Thomas) Barbara's next appearance where she finally meets Ka-Zar and is reunited with her fianc\u00e9 (whose name is revealed as \"Paul\").[14] In the following issue (written by Thomas alone), Ka-Zar leads the two characters through the dangerous Savage Land.[15]/nAstonishing Tales #12 (June 1972) is a key early appearance for the character, due in part to Marvel's decision to feature Man-Thing in this issue. At this point, Man-Thing had made only one previous appearance, in the 1971 black-and-white magazine Savage Tales #1.[16] A follow-up seven-page Man-Thing story by writer Len Wein and artist Neal Adams was commissioned for a version of Savage Tales #2 that was ultimately never published.[17] Finally seeing print in Astonishing Tales #12, the sequence is presented as a flashback and an interlude between the main action of the book./nOne of the characters in the Wein/Adams story is a blonde female scientist called \"Dr. Barbara Morse\". Morse is working on a research project in the Florida Everglades called Project: Gladiator, which is an attempt to replicate the Super-Soldier serum which was used to create Captain America. This is the same research which Ted Sallis had previously been working on when a flawed serum transformed him into the Man-Thing. In the story, Morse is abducted by AIM thugs and is later liberated through the intervention of the Man-Thing.[18]/nFraming the flashback is a sequence of newer material by writer Roy Thomas and artist John Buscema in which Barbara (now revealed to be \"Dr. Barbara Morse\" and thus the character from the Wein/Adams Man-Thing story) and Paul (now \"Dr. Paul Allen\") accompany Ka-Zar back to the United States and explain that they sought him out so that he could help them deal with the problems surrounding the appearance of the Man-Thing in Florida.[19]/nIn the next issue, the storyline is wrapped up and Paul reveals he is a double agent working for A.I.M. It is also revealed for the first time that Barbara has connections with S.H.I.E.L.D.; the spy agency asked her to pretend to love Allen to \"learn what [she] could\"[20] about his activities with AIM. At the story's end Paul dies at the hands of the Man-Thing and Barbara expresses the hope that she can \"go back to just being a scientist again\".[20]/nMike Friedrich took over from Roy Thomas to become writer of Astonishing Tales with #15 (Dec. 1972). He introduces a new status-quo in which Ka-Zar is living in New York and \"lady biologist\" and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Barbara (who now prefers to be called \"Bobbi\") Morse is his constant companion.[21]/nFriedrich remained the writer of the various color Ka-Zar series for the next two years[22][23] and for most of that period he continued to feature Morse as Ka-Zar's sidekick and occasional love interest. In these stories she is depicted as a fully trained S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. Contemptuous of his jungle origins, she is Ka-Zar's escort to the city and modern life. Together she and Ka-Zar tackle threats such as the Pusher,[24] Gemini,[25] Victorius,[26][27][28] Gog,[26] and the Plunderer.[25][26] As the series progresses, she begins to wear a regular costume of tinted-glasses, a red one-piece, and boots. Her S.H.I.E.L.D. designation of \"Agent 19\" is revealed[26] and she and Ka-Zar finally kiss.[29]/nIn 1974, the color Ka-Zar series left Astonishing Tales and was relaunched in the Ka-Zar, Lord of the Hidden Jungle title. The strip is set once again in the Savage Land and Morse is absent for the first story. She returns in the third issue\u2014explaining that Nick Fury had sent her on a S.H.I.E.L.D. assignment to look into \"El Tigre\", a subversive who is exploiting the energy crisis in South America.[30] This leads her to reluctantly travel back to the Savage Land, where she and Ka-Zar defeat El Tigre and his ally Man-God together.[31]/nThe introduction of Shanna the She-Devil into Ka-Zar's supporting cast[32] changes Morse's role in the stories of this period. Ka-Zar expresses clear attraction to the more jungle-friendly Shanna from the outset[33] and Morse is cast as the secondary love interest. This dynamic is most notable in Morse's lone appearance in the Ka-Zar strip in the black-and-white magazine Savage Tales (#8; Jan. 1975). Written by Gerry Conway, the story depicts Morse leading Shanna and a group of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents into the Savage Land where they work with Ka-Zar to neutralise a threat to world security. During the course of the adventure, Morse realises that Ka-Zar's affections lie with Shanna.[34] This story, first published in late-1974, is the last in which Morse appears as a Ka-Zar supporting character./nA year later, Mike Friedrich returned to the character in a 20-page story with art by George Evans. Published in the one-shot black-and-white magazine Marvel Super Action #1 (Jan. 1976), the story is the first in which Morse appears as a costumed super heroine and lead protagonist. While operating as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, she is recruited by a United States Senator to look into corruption in a Latin American branch of the espionage organization. To complete her mission, she \"drops out\" of S.H.I.E.L.D. and takes on the superhero identity of the \"Huntress\".[35]/nIn a text piece in Marvel Super Action #1, editor Archie Goodwin explained how Morse came to be used for this story/nI suggested the title [\"Huntress\"] and the notion of using S.H.I.E.L.D. to writer Mike Friedrich. He decided to draw upon a character he'd helped develop while scripting the color Ka-Zar comic, and wound up revamping her totally. With a bit of kibitzing from Mike and myself, artist George Evans designed the lady's costume and we were in business.[36]/nMarvel Super Action was designed as a bi-monthly publication, but the economic recession of the mid-1970s forced Marvel to scale back their plans and the magazine was published as a one-off.[36] This meant that the plot of Huntress, intended as a two-parter,[36] had to be condensed before publication and no follow-up stories by the same creators were ever produced./nMorse's next published appearance was Marvel Team-Up #95 (July, 1980) in which she dons a new costume and finally takes on the alias \"Mockingbird\".[37] This story explains that she has continued to look into corruption in S.H.I.E.L.D. and in doing so has come to be hunted by the organization which mistakes her for a criminal. Teaming up with Spider-Man (and with assistance from S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury), Mockingbird confronts Carl Delanden, a corrupt S.H.I.E.L.D. branch director. In the ensuing battle, she is shot by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who were ordered to subdue her at any cost. The story ends with an unconscious, badly injured but exonerated Mockingbird left in the care of Nick Fury./nIn the letters column of that issue, the series' then assistant editor Mark Gruenwald explained the creative origins of this new iteration of Bobbi Morse:/n'Where did this Mockingbird come from?' some of you may be asking. After all it isn't every day that a new super heroine is premiered in Marvel Team-Up. Well the story behind her creation is this: when I had been writing the Spider-Woman book one of my chief objectives was to build up a rogue's gallery that S-W could call her own. One of several characters I conceived and designed was Mockingbird. Showing the sketch to Steven Grant, writer about town, he helped me work out her powers and weaponry. Well I never got round to doing a Mockingbird story before I left Spider-Woman, so I put the idea on the back burner.\nTime passed, and Steven was searching for something new and different to do in Team-Up. He was toying with the idea some of us have had to revamp the Bobbi Morse character (of Ka-Zar and Super-Action fame). Somehow we got the notion to amalgamate the two concepts and make Bobbi Morse the Mockingbird (Anyone venture a guess why we abandoned the \"Huntress\" moniker?) All that was necessary was to change her hair and skin color since the original M.B. was going to be black. So that's the story behind the story.[38]/nThe reference to the \"why we abandoned the \"'Huntress' moniker\" is a nod to the fact that Marvel's rival DC Comics had debuted a character with the same name in the interim between Marvel Super Action #1 and Marvel Team-Up #95. DC's \"Huntress, the superhero daughter of the Batman and Catwoman of Earth-Two, debuted in  All Star Comics #69 and DC Super-Stars #17 (both Dec. 1977)./nThe character next appeared in Gruenwald's 1983 four-issue Hawkeye miniseries.[39] Fully recovered from her injuries, Mockingbird investigates corruption at Cross Technological Enterprises, where Clint Barton/Hawkeye works as security chief. Though the two initially come into conflict with each other, they end up co-operating to fight the villain Crossfire and by the series end they are shown to be seriously romantically involved, having eloped together to the Pocono Mountains and apparently married.[40]/nThe miniseries reveals how Morse became involved with S.H.I.E.L.D. recounting how she left her biology studies at Georgia Tech to follow her \"favorite prof\"[41] Wilma Calvin on the government's Project: Gladiator. The research project was partly sponsored by S.H.I.E.L.D. which led Morse to enroll in their spy school and graduate at the top of her class. It is also revealed that she spent six months convalescing in a private hospital after the injuries she suffered in Marvel Team-Up #95.[41]/nGruenwald was editor of the Avengers title in late 1983 when writer Roger Stern began to feature Hawkeye and Mockingbird as members of the series' supporting cast.[42] In a short period Mockingbird moves back into Avengers Mansion with Barton as he returns to active duty,[42] she is formally introduced to the team as his wife,[43] the Vision then proposes that Hawkeye and Mockingbird establish a second Avengers team on the West Coast of the United States,[44] and the two move out to Los Angeles.[45]/nThis leads into the 1984 four-issue West Coast Avengers limited series, also written by Stern and edited by Gruenwald. In this series, Mockingbird becomes a full-fledged Avenger as she assists her husband in setting up a new branch of the organization.[46]/nWest Coast Avengers became a regular series in 1985 and Steve Englehart, the series writer for its first 42 issues, featured Mockingbird heavily as one of the main cast members of the book. A year into the series, Mockingbird begins to wear a modified version of her original costume, designed by series artist Al Milgrom.[47]/nOver the latter course of his run, Englehart developed a storyline in which the relationship between Hawkeye and Mockingbird is put under serious strain. When the West Coast Avengers are transported to the Old West of 1876, the Phantom Rider (Lincoln Slade) abducts, drugs, and brainwashes Mockingbird into forgetting her original life and convinces her she is in love with Slade (and by implication, raping her). After breaking free of his control, Mockingbird seeks revenge on the Rider, and is shown allowing him to plunge to his death off of a cliff.[48]/nHawkeye learns Mockingbird let the Phantom Rider die and harshly disapproves of her actions which leads Mockingbird to leave both Hawkeye and the Avengers.[49] For a time, she and ex-Avengers Tigra and Moon Knight operate as a small fighting unit and have various adventures including a battle with the High Evolutionary[50] and an encounter with the modern-day Phantom Rider who is possessed by his 19th century ancestor.[51] In one story, Mockingbird's arrest of the Digger causes a rift between the West Coast Avengers and the Night Shift.[52] Mockingbird later reconciles with the no-longer-possessed Phantom Rider.[53]/nJohn Byrne became writer and artist of West Coast Avengers in 1989 and in his first story Mockingbird returns and admits to inadvertently betraying the team.[54] She later explains that she was duped by a group who claimed to be connected to S.H.I.E.L.D. into revealing security information about their headquarters for a \"contingency\" plan to neutralise the Vision in the event he should try to take over the world once again. In fact, the plan is put into operation immediately and, when Mockingbird realizes this, she rushes to the West Coast Avenger's headquarters only to arrive too late, the group having already abducted and dismantled the android.[55] The group is revealed to be a consortium of international security services and though the Vision is eventually restored his memory and personality are erased.[56]/nLater, Mockingbird tracks down Clint Barton (Hawkeye) and makes an attempt at reconciliation, admitting she still loves him. During their discussion, Barton reveals they had previously decided to divorce.[57] Hawkeye and Mockingbird then travel to Milwaukee to look into the appearance of a group calling themselves the \"Great Lakes Avengers\". Upon investigation, the couple decides to stay in Milwaukee to train the amateur superhero group and work on their relationship.[57]/nMockingbird's next regular appearances are as a supporting character in the Hawkeye strip in Avengers Spotlight, in a storyline written by Steve Gerber in which she aids her husband as he takes on the Los Angeles Asian crime lord Lotus.[58]/nRoy Thomas returned to writing the character when he and his wife Dann Thomas became co-writers of the rechristened Avengers West Coast title in 1990. Mockingbird first makes a brief reappearance in the title when she attends an Avengers West Coast team meeting and stands for election to return to the team, being voted in as an \"alternate member\" (effectively a reserve member). Hawkeye (who is already a full member, having returned to the series a year earlier) admits he did not vote for her and describes her as his \"estranged wife\". Mockingbird then returns to Detroit.[59]/nIn a later storyline, Morse contacts Barton and states that she is returning to Los Angeles from Detroit to discuss matters with him.[60] She is then reunited with her husband while he is in the field as Hawkeye, joining him and the Avengers West Coast on a mission[61] after which Mockingbird begins to once again make regular appearances as a cast member of the book. Mockingbird later reveals to Hawkeye that their divorce is almost final[62] and Ultron abducts her and uses her thought patterns and personality to create his second robotic 'wife' Alkhema, the two rekindling their romance after she is liberated.[63]/nThe intended interpretation of some of these events is changed by a story that is published 17 years later. New Avengers: The Reunion #2 (May 2009) asserts that just prior to her abduction by Ultron, Mockingbird was replaced by the Skrull impersonator H'rpra, and thus the \"Mockingbird\" who appears between Avengers West Coast vol. 1, #89/90 (Dec. 1992/Jan. 1993) and Secret Invasion #8 (Jan. 2009) should no longer be considered the genuine article.[64]/nThe reconciliation between Hawkeye and Mockingbird is short-lived as in late 1993 Thomas has the character sacrifice her life to save her husband from Mephisto in the centennial issue of Avengers West Coast.[65][66]/nThe Avengers West Coast title was canceled two issues later. The storyline depicted how the team, reeling from the events surrounding Mockingbird's death, is ultimately forced to disband.[67]/nIn 1998, writer Kurt Busiek briefly revived the character in the Avengers volume 3 series where she appears as a reanimated corpse, a member of the Legion of the Unliving, part of the Grim Reaper's plot to destroy the Avengers.[68]/nIn 1999's Thunderbolts Annual 2000, writers Busiek and Fabian Nicieza have Mockingbird send a message from the afterlife that results in the resurrection of Hellcat. Her reasons for being in Hell are unclear, though she denies it is due to her previous refusal to save the Phantom Rider, hinting that her presence in Hell is serving some purpose.[69] In the subsequent Hellcat limited series by writer Steve Englehart, Mockingbird is depicted fighting endless battles in Hell.[70]/nThe character next appears in the tongue-in-cheek 2006 X-Statix Presents: Dead Girl miniseries by writer Peter Milligan. In this series she is depicted as residing in Heaven, where she is an active member of a book club that also includes Dead Girl, Gwen Stacy and Moira MacTaggert. She is recruited by Doctor Strange and Dead Girl to help defeat Mr. Pitiful and his group of resurrected supervillains. She returns to Heaven at the series conclusion and no reference is made to her previous appearances in Hell.[71]/nIn a 2009 interview Marvel editor and writer Jim McCann revealed how the decision to resurrect Mockingbird was made creatively:/nAbout a year-and-a-half ago, we were planning the ending for \"Secret Invasion\" and with one character we wanted to get back something that the Skrulls would have taken away. There were a couple of characters on the list for that, but Mockingbird was the one I fought for the most, and as [Secret Invasion series writer] Brian [Bendis] has pointed out, I said that they were like the Mr. & Mrs. Smith of the Marvel Universe. He was like, \"That sounds great. We can use that\".[72]/nBendis first teases at Mockingbird's return when, at the beginning of \"Secret Invasion\", a spaceship crash-lands in the Savage Land and a large group of superheroes emerges from the wreckage, among whom is a character who looks exactly like Mockingbird.[73] All the members of this group present themselves as the genuine article\u2014they claim that at some point in the past they were each abducted and replaced by Skrull imposters, the Skrulls being a race of alien shape-shifters. Clint Barton, who is present at the scene (and at this point goes by the code name \"Ronin\") believes this \"Mockingbird\"'s claims to be his wife because she is able to tell him the significance of the date \"October 12\" to their relationship. The date would have been the birthday of the couple's (previously unmentioned) miscarried child, which\u2014it is explained\u2014was conceived at some point during their joint career as Avengers.[74] Barton initially defends this \"Mockingbird\" from the suspicions of other superheroes, but when she is revealed to be a Skrull imposter he kills her in a fit of rage.[75]/nLater in the series Iron Man finds a Skrull ship in orbit which genuinely contains various individuals who had been abducted and replaced by the Skrulls. The real Mockingbird is revealed to be among them and she tearfully reunites with Barton.[76]/nIn a subsequent issue of Avengers: The Initiative writers Christos Gage and Dan Slott include Mockingbird among a group of Skrull abductees who attend a support meeting about their experience.[77]/nAfter the character's return in the 2008 \"Secret Invasion\" storyline, Bendis began to use Mockingbird regularly in the New Avengers title. She joins the team[78] (in which her husband, still using the code-name \"Ronin\", is also a member), and with them she fights the Hood's gang of super-villains,[79] learns Spider-Man's true identity,[80] and battles Dormammu.[81]/nMockingbird gains a new costume in 2009's New Avengers: The Reunion miniseries, which was pencilled by David Lopez and Jo Chen and written by the editor and writer who had previously advocated for Morse's return: Jim McCann. The plot of the series involves Mockingbird and Clint Barton/Ronin teaming-up to take on A.I.M. Scientist Supreme Monica Rappaccini. During the story Morse reveals that she and a group of fellow former S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who were also Skrull abductees have formed a new espionage organization\u2014the \"World Counter-terrorism Agency\" or \"W.C.A.\" (the abbreviation being a nod to Barton and Morse's former \"West Coast Avengers\" team).[82]/nThis series also reveals that Mockingbird was replaced by a Skrull just prior to her abduction by Ultron.[64] This is a plot-point in the series as it establishes that prior to her abduction Barton and Morse were in the process of being divorced and so she is technically no longer married to him. By the story's conclusion they rekindle their relationship, though they decide to remain unmarried.[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed]/nIn one subsequent New Avengers storyline Mockingbird is the only member left standing when a device invented by Jonas Harrow inhibits the rest of her teammates superpowers.[83] Morse is forced to fight the entire Wrecking Crew alone in Times Square and is eventually defeated by them.[84] However she later returns to the scene with an Avengers Quinjet to rescue her colleagues.[85]/nAnother plotline involves Clint Barton/Ronin vowing to kill Norman Osborn. Morse and the other New Avengers object to the idea so Barton attempts the assassination alone and in secret. He ultimately fails and is captured by the Dark Avengers,[86] leading Mockingbird to mount a rescue mission with other Avengers and liberate Barton.[87]/nIn March 2010 Marvel announced that a new Hawkeye & Mockingbird ongoing series would be launched in June 2010, produced by the New Avengers: The Reunion creative team of writer Jim McCann and artist David Lopez. Promotional interviews revealed that the premise of the series involved Morse and Clint Barton (once again under the code-name \"Hawkeye\") working together as agents of the World Counter-terrorism Agency. They are both also still members of the New Avengers,[88][89][90][91] although Barton soon leaves the team because he prefers to work on the main Avengers team, saying that he was only with the New Avengers to spend time with his wife.[92]/nDuring a raid on a warehouse that is revealed to be the location of H.A.M.M.E.R.'s attempt to reorganize after the defeat of Norman Osborn, Bobbi is mortally injured in a shooting despite Spider-Man's attempts to save her,[93] forcing her teammates to evacuate her to the hospital.[94] While Mockingbird lies in hospital in critical condition, Nick Fury contacts the team and gives her a top secret serum that was created by the Germans in 1959 and has recently been rediscovered by the H.A.M.M.E.R. agents; a combination of the Super Soldier Serum that turned Steve Rogers into Captain America, and the Infinity Formula that slowed Fury's aging. The Formula saves her life, but Nick warns the New Avengers that he cannot predict the consequences of turning Mockingbird into a combination of himself and Rogers.[95]/nAfter being injected with the Formula during the \"Fear Itself\" storyline, Mockingbird makes a quick and complete recovery from her injury, and exhibits powers similar to Steve Rogers. She is quite relieved and happy to be alive, and fights the Serpent's forces in New York with vigor. After she witnesses Avengers Tower fall, her feelings of happiness are sobered, and she vows to defeat Sin.[96]/nHawkeye and Mockingbird remain divorced, going their separate paths.[94]/nAs part of the 2012 Marvel NOW! branding, Mockingbird appears as part of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s new Secret Avengers roster, making her debut appearance while helping Nick Fury, Jr. capture Taskmaster. During that mission, she uses S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Camo-Tech to disguise herself as Aloysius Thorndrake of the Shadow Council.[97] Mockingbird goes to A.I.M. Island to assist Taskmaster in helping make contact between the rogue Iron Patriot drones and James Rhodes.[98]/nAs part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel branding, Mockingbird helps Spider-Man when they pursue Zodiac's Leo Sect down the highways of Shanghai, China as they give a status report to Nick Fury, Jr. When they catch the lead Leo Sect member, Mockingbird accuses him of adhering to his \"no-one dies around me\" idealism after using an antidote to counter the lead Leo Sect member's suicide pill. Spider-Man tells her he's not so naive anymore and simply wants to save everyone he can.[99]/nAfter recovering the Webware from Pisces, Aquarius, and Cancer, Spider-Man gives the status of the mission to Mockingbird and Nick Fury Jr. Mockingbird tells Spider-Man that Leo is still being interrogated and has not snitched yet.[100] During their collaboration she had a brief relationship with Spider-Man.[101]/nDuring \"Civil War II,\" Mockingbird is invited to a cosplay cruise with the promise of secret documents to prove Hawkeye's innocence. It turns out to be a ruse by the Phantom Rider to win back her love. She is able to remove him from his corporeal form, but both fall into the water as the cruise rounds the Bermuda Triangle. Bobbi is rescued by Lance Hunter, but the Phantom is destroyed by the waters.[102]/nDuring the \"Secret Empire\" storyline, Mockingbird appears as a member of the Underground following Hydra's takeover of the United States.[103] It is later revealed that she is Maria Hill's inside person in the main Underground.[104]/nDuring the \"Iron Man 2020\" event, Mockingbird appears as a member of Force Works. Their mission takes them to the island of Lingares where they deal with some Deathloks and Ultimo.[105]/nDuring the \"Empyre\" storyline, Quicksilver, Mockingbird, and Wonder Man deal with the Kree and the Skrull's fight with the Cotati near Navojoa. When Quicksilver is hit by special spheres fired by the Cotati magicians, Mockingbird and Wonder Man come to his aid and help the Kree and the Skrull turn the tide against the Cotati.[106]/nBobbi Morse is a trained S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who graduated at the top of her class[41] and as such she is very proficient in several forms of hand-to-hand combat, including Kung Fu[107] and Taekwondo[107] and familiar with a wide range of weapons. The character usually uses a pair of batons which can be combined to form a single b\u014d-staff in combat, weapons with which she has great expertise.[64][108] Morse also used a pair of night vision and vision enhancing goggles, similarly to her once-husband Hawkeye. She also possesses a Ph.D. in biology.[19][41] During one comic book series, Spider-Man provided her with a new uniform courtesy of Parker Industries for being their S.H.I.E.L.D. liaison.[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed] This costume came attached with wing-like extensions allowing Morse to glide on wind currents./nTo cope with a mortal injury she sustained in a mission, Mockingbird was injected with an experimental serum combining the Super Soldier Serum that gave Captain America his strength and the Infinity Formula that has slowed Nick Fury's aging.[108] The obvious consequence of this was that her injuries were healed, but Fury admitted his uncertainty about the formula's long-term consequences on her biology. Thus far, she has exhibited greatly enhanced physical strength, healing and agility.[95][5]/nMatthew Erao of Screen Rant referred to Mockingbird as one of the \"most powerful agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,\" writing, \"There have been a lot of formidable Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the organization's long comic history. While many know Bobbi Morse as the superhero Mockingbird or S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent 19, she\u2019s also Dr. Barbara Morse, a genius in biology. Her Ph.D. in the field led to her working on Project: Gladiator in the Everglades, the same Super Soldier program that led to Ted Sallis becoming Man-Thing. Aside from her expert knowledge, she\u2019s also one of the most skilled S.H.I.E.L.D. agents there is. Introduced in Astonishing Tales #6 in 1971, Bobbi was almost a throwaway character before being crafted over the course of several comics into the genius badass we all know and love.\"[5] David Harth of CBR.com called Mockingbird one of the \"greatest avengers,\" asserting, \"The Avengers boast a vast array of mighty heroes. The greatest among them rely on their inner strength, standing courageous in the face of danger. Mockingbird made a name for herself at S.H.I.E.L.D. Injected with a variant on the super soldier serum, Agent Bobbi Morse became Mockingbird and joined up with the Avengers, eventually marrying Hawkeye and helping found the West Coast Avengers. She was the heart and soul of the team, never shying away from the frontline. Mockingbird had some enhancements, including rapid healing, but she was only human.

And to my delight, the opening scene of this issue kicks off in exactly that vein. Too often, miniseries granted a full return miss what made the original great, but McCann has nailed it here, quickly reintroducing the setup and setting about expanding the world of the two heroes. [...] For his part, David Lopez' art is fantastic: bright, clear storytelling, fluid and natural-looking figure work, and a brilliant aptitude for the sort of action sequence McCann is writing. The world is detailed and realistic, while Clint and Bobbi are both confident and sexy without being gratuitously drawn. For its part in the Big Avengers reshuffle, everything about the issue screams \"Heroic Age\". It feels like a new beginning, and it keeps up the high standard already set by \"Avengers\" and \"Secret Avengers\". The characters might not be the obvious choice of series lead, but McCann has written a book that seems original without being unfamiliar, and feel traditional while retaining a modern edge. Literally the only thing that upsets me about Hawkeye and Mockingbird is the feeling that it's far from being a sure thing. In many ways, this series has the potential to be the next \"SWORD\", the next \"Captain Britain\", the next \"Power Girl\"\u2014a smart, funny, fresh take on superheroics that winds up ending before its time. This series deserves a long and entertaining run. Let's get the word out.\"[119] Bryan Joel of IGN gave Hawkeye & Mockingbird #1 a grade of 7.7 out of 10, stating, \"It's also interesting that Hawkeye gets first billing in the title, as even though he's the focal point for the issue and provides the narration, for all intents and purposes this is Mockingbird's book. For one, Clint already has regular billing in Avengers; as of this moment, this is the only place readers can catch Mockingbird's adventures. But more importantly, she's a more interesting character since her return. McCann writes Bobbi with an hardened edge and as a bit of an action junkie. She's only ever shown happy when she's throwing baddies from moving vehicles or watching them get impaled with Hawkeye's arrows. We're clearly dealing with a character who's not quite as balanced as she used to be, and a dredging-up of her sexual assault history with the Phantom Rider only serves to reinforce that. Finally, there's also a touch of irony to the title of Hawkeye & Mockingbird. While they've reconciled for the most part, the pair couldn't be on more different paths. Much of the issue is spent with Bobbi purposely ignoring Clint, or the couple furthering agendas that they're keeping hidden from each other. Readers coming into this series expecting hearts and flowers alongside their arrows and battle staves may be disappointed, but ultimately it makes for better reading. There's some definite friction between the two leads, friction which should develop into interesting stories as it moves forward. Is Hawkeye & Mockingbird #1 a groundbreaking work? No, but it fits well within \"The Heroic Age\" initiative, providing some old-fashioned superheroics and enough interpersonal drama to keep it engaging along the way. McCann lays the groundwork for what could turn out to be a very rewarding examination of two heroes struggling to make it work in the midst of the Marvel Universe's craziness.\"[120]/nAccording to Diamond Comic Distributors, Mockingbird: S.H.I.E.L.D. 50th Anniversary #1 was the 80th best selling comic book in September 2015.[121][122][123]/nDoug Zawisza of CBR.com called Mockingbird: S.H.I.E.L.D. 50th Anniversary #1 a \"gorgeous book that maintains a high standard from start to finish,\" asserting, \"Jones' art is boldly colored by Rosenberg, who keeps the characters in realistic tones and shades but unleashes all sorts of crazy colors and patterns for the backgrounds. Caramagna adds in snappy sound effects (most notably in the morgue), using a different but clean font. He also balances the dialogue and captions throughout the story, keeping Jones' art clean. The story itself is constructed on a plot that exists solely to explain Bobbi Morse to newer readers. Cain does a great job of personalizing Mockingbird, but the story in this issue feels like a tryout. There's just enough here to sample but not quite enough to satisfy. I like what Cain does with the characters and the pacing is smart, but now I'd like to see a story with a slightly bigger scope, as Cain certainly makes Mockingbird worth reading. [...] \"Mockingbird: S.H.I.E.L.D. 50th Anniversary\" #1 is a decent read with a fun, fast-paced Mockingbird story and an intriguing but thin introduction to Red Widow. Both characters clearly have paths taking them elsewhere from this shared publication, but fans of Mockingbird will be pleased with this purchase.

The real-to-life situations, the reflexive humor, and the super spy fun are all present; but what makes Bobbi such an interesting and unique character here is her assuredness and swagger. It\u2019s so fun to watch people who are great at what they do, doing that. That credit goes not only to first-time comic book writer (and bestselling thriller author) Chelsea Cain, but also to Joelle Jones who reflects Bobbi\u2019s confidence perfectly in his clean, assured, and sprightly line work.

If I had to compare her to another artist, it would be Frank Cho by virtue of her strong but graceful ink lines and the beautiful, smooth features she gives her characters. Niemczyk's art is more naturally proportioned, though, and includes a wider variety of body types. Niemczyk understands the humor in Cain's script and brings it to life here; she's able to bring Bobbi's montage of stress and interruptions to life in a way that shows Mockingbird as capable while also making the situations funny. Who knew that Iron Man being held by the neck and getting yelled at about quinoa was something we've been missing all these years? There are so many great little touches going on here too, from the hideous wallpaper in each room of the medical center to the carefully constructed shirts and outfits. Even moments like Mockingbird drumming her fingers while having ESP cards shoved in her face again is great, in part because Niemczyk makes it all look natural. Add in some bold and vivid (but never oversaturated) colors from Rosenberg, and this comic just looks gorgeous. I hope the remaining issues are just as much fun, but -- no matter what happens from this point on -- \"Mockingbird\" #1 is a dynamite debut from Cain, Niemczyk and Rosenberg. Two big, big thumbs up.\"[132] Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave Mockingbird #1 a grade of 8.6 out of 10, writing, \"Marvel's decision to release Mockingbird #1 one week after Mark Waid and Chris Samnee's new Black Widow series kicked off seemed dubious. How is one book about a butt-kicking femme fatale and agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. supposed to thrive in the shadow of another book about a butt-kicking femme fatale and agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.? But as it turns out, the two books could hardly be more different in tone and execution. Mockingbird mixes equal parts Spider-Woman and Howard the Duck for a very entertaining look at the life and times of Bobbi Morse. This new series builds on Mockingbird's current status quo. Having been dosed with a combination of the Super-Soldier Serum and the Infinity Formula, Bobbi is understandably a subject of interest and concern for SHIELD's medical staff. This issue opens as a simple, goofy slice-of-life tale as it follows Bobbi on her many visits to the doctor. But writer Chelsea Cain slowly transitions from humor to paranoia and foreboding as it becomes clear that not all is right in Bobbi's world.  [...] Mockingbird's new series could have been a simple effort to cash in on the character's recent mainstream exposure. Luckily, it's something much more ambitious and unique than that.

This discovery ended doubt of what the apparatus looked like, as well as opened a variety of new questions about the makeup of the apparatus, and how the appearance and disappearance of the structure was controlled. He never lost interest in the apparatus, and continued to research it throughout his career.[2]/nMazia's doctoral research worked mainly with sea urchins, and focused on the calcium ions involved in cell regulation. He introduced many ideas about a free calcium during fertilisation, which linked the idea that redistributing Ca2+ ions help to activate the egg to form the offspring.[2]/nWhen he went to work with the University of Missouri, his research focused on the structure of the nucleus.[2]/nAfter his retirement from Berkeley, he went to work for Stanford University at the Hopkins Marine Station, where he researched the structure and replication of the centrosomal complex and proposed ideas as to how it might function as a regulator of cell structure.[2]/nSome other research was focused on the cell theory in which he concluded that the eukaryotic cell is a whole unit in which the structure contains the basic needs of living for any unit.[4]/nMazia was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Harry Everhart (June 5, 1918 \u2013 October 1, 1994) was one of the leaders in fisheries science, fisheries management, and fisheries education in North America.[1]/nHe was born (June 5, 1918) in Connellsville, Pennsylvania. In 1940, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from Westminster College (Pennsylvania). He earned a Master of Science degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 1942 and immediately entered the United States Air Force, achieving the rank of Squadron Commander.[1]/nIn 1945, Everhart enrolled in the fisheries doctoral program at Cornell University. He was awarded a PhD in 1948 and joined the faculty at the University of Maine in 1949. In 1950, he was also appointed Chief of Fisheries of the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Game. In 1955, he was also appointed Chief of Research of the Maine Atlantic Salmon Commission. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1952 and to Professor in 1956.[1] He served as chairman of the fishery major at Colorado State University (1967-1972) and chairman of the Department of Natural Resources at Cornell University (1972-1982.[1]/nDuring his tenure at the University of Maine, Colorado State University, and Cornell University, he coauthored (1953) a text in fisheries science.[2] Second (1975)[3] and third (1981)[4] editions were produced with various coauthors. These texts were widely used in university fisheries courses for many years./nApart from his widely used fisheries management texts, Everhart is probably best known for his influence on graduate students and the development of the Fisheries Division of the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. He served as the academic advisor to many MS and PhD students while a professor at the University of Maine, Colorado State University, and Cornell University. Altogether, he authored or coauthored 54 scholarly articles and books.[5][6]", "1099984": "David Satcher, (born March 2, 1941) is an American physician, and public health administrator. He was a four-star admiral in the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and served as the 10th Assistant Secretary for Health, and the 16th Surgeon General of the United States./nSatcher was born in Anniston, Alabama. At the age of two, he contracted whooping cough. A Black doctor, Dr. Jackson, came to his parents' farm, and told his parents he didn't expect David to live, but nonetheless spent the day with him and told his parents how to give him the best chance he could. Satcher said that he grew up hearing that story, and that inspired him to be a doctor.[1] While in college, Satcher was active in the Civil Rights Movement and was arrested on multiple occasions.[2]/nSatcher graduated from Morehouse College in Atlanta in 1963 and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He received his MD and a PhD in cell biology from Case Western Reserve University in 1970 with election to the Alpha Omega Alpha honor society.

He is a fellow of the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Preventive Medicine, and the American College of Physicians, and is board certified in preventive medicine. Satcher pledged Omega Psi Phi fraternity and is an initiate of the Psi chapter of Morehouse College./nSatcher served as professor and Chairman of the Department of Community Medicine and Family Practice at Morehouse School of Medicine from 1979 to 1982. He is a former faculty member of the UCLA School of Medicine, the UCLA School of Public Health, and the King-Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles, where he developed and chaired the King-Drew Department of Family Medicine. From 1975 to 1979, he served as the interim Dean of the Charles R. Drew Postgraduate Medical School, during which time, he negotiated the agreement with UCLA School of Medicine and the Board of Regents that led to a medical education program at King-Drew. He also directed the King-Drew Sickle Cell Research Center for six years. Satcher served as President of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee, from 1982 to 1993. He also held the posts of Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry from 1993 to 1998./nUnder Satcher's leadership, the CDC took millions of dollars Congress set aside for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) research and secretly spent the funds in other areas.[3] The misappropriation of funds continued for three years (from 1995-1998) and the CDC attempted to cover up their actions. The issue only came to light after a CDC employee filed a whistleblower report and a special Inspector General was appointed to investigate the matter.[4] In the words of Martha Katz, Deputy Director for Policy and Legislation at CDC: \"Resources intended for CFS were actually used for measles, polio and other disease areas. This was a breach of CDC's solemn trust and is in direct conflict with its core values.\" Despite the fact that millions of Americans suffer from CFS, Satcher's administration ignored the severity of the illness and engaged in misconduct that set back CFS research 5-6 years. Satcher has not issued a formal apology for the harm caused by his administration./nSatcher served simultaneously in the positions of Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health from February 1998 through January 2001 at the US Department of Health and Human Services.  As such, he is the first Surgeon General to be appointed as a four-star admiral in the PHSCC, to reflect his dual offices./nIn his first year as Surgeon General, Satcher released the 1998 Surgeon General's report \"Tobacco Use Among U.S. Racial/Ethnic Minority Groups.\"  In it he reported that tobacco use was on the rise among youth in each of the country's major racial and ethnic groups, threatening their long-term health prospects.[5]/nSatcher was appointed by Bill Clinton, and remained Surgeon General until 2002, contemporaneously with the first half of the first term of President George W. Bush's administration. Eve Slater would later replace him as Assistant Secretary for Health in 2001. Because he no longer held his dual office, Satcher was reverted and downgraded to the grade of vice admiral in the regular corps for the remainder of his term as Surgeon General. In 2001, his office released the report, The Call to Action to Promote Sexual Health and Responsible Sexual Behavior. The report was hailed by the chairman of the American Academy of Family Physicians as an overdue paradigm shift\u2014\"The only way we're going to change approaches to sexual behavior and sexual activity is through school. In school, not only at the doctor's office.\" However, conservative political groups denounced the report as being too permissive towards homosexuality and condom distribution in schools. When Satcher left office, he retired with the rank of vice admiral./nUpon his departure from the post, Satcher became a fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation. In the fall of 2002, he assumed the post of Director of the National Center for Primary Care at the Morehouse School of Medicine./nOn December 20, 2004, Satcher was named interim president at Morehouse School of Medicine until John E. Maupin, Jr., former president of Meharry Medical College assumed the current position on February 26, 2006. In June 2006, Satcher established the Satcher Health Leadership Institute (SHLI) at Morehouse School of Medicine as a natural extension of his experiences improving public health policy for all Americans and his commitment to eliminating health disparities for minorities, the poor, and other disadvantaged groups./nIn 2013, he co-founded the advocacy group African American Network Against Alzheimer's./nAs of 2002, he sits on the boards of Johnson & Johnson and, as of 2007, MetLife.[6][7]/nWhile acknowledging progress, Satcher has criticized health disparities. He asked the question, \u201cWhat if we had eliminated disparities in health in the last century?\u201d and calculated that there would have been 83,500 fewer Black deaths in the year 2000. That would have included 24,000 fewer Black deaths from cardiovascular disease. If infant mortality had been equal across racial and ethnic groups in 2000, 4,700 fewer Black infants would have died in their first year of life./nWithout disparities, there would have been 22,000 fewer Black deaths from diabetes and almost 2,000 fewer Black women would have died from breast cancer; 250,000 fewer Blacks would have been infected with HIV/AIDS and 7,000 fewer Blacks would have died from complications due to AIDS in 2000. As many as 2.5 million additional Blacks, including 650,000 children, would have had health insurance in that year. He called on people to work for solutions at the individual, community, and policy level.[8]/nSatcher supports a Medicare-for-all style single payer health plan, in which insurance companies would be eliminated and the government would pay health care costs directly to doctors, hospitals and other providers through the tax system.[9]/nIn 1990, while President of Meharry Medical College, Satcher founded a quarterly academic journal entitled the Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved. Both the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Medical Library Association rate this journal as one of the nation's important public health journals.[citation needed]/nHe is the recipient of many honorary degrees and numerous distinguished honors, including the Public Health Service Distinguished Service Medal, the 2013 UC Berkeley School of Public Health Public Health Heroes Award,[10] an honorary Doctor of Science from Harvard University (2011), an honorary Doctor of Public Health from Dickinson College (2016), and top awards from the American Medical Association, the American College of Physicians, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and Ebony magazine. In 1995, he received the Breslow Award in Public Health and in 1997 the New York Academy of Medicine Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2004, he received the Benjamin E. Mays Trailblazer Award and the Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Award for Humanitarian Contributions to the Health of Humankind from the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.

Barber addresses questions on how signaling networks[5] and the actin cytoskeleton[6] control normal and pathological cell behavior, particularly the post-translational modifications of proteins by protonation[7] and by phosphorylation.[8] Her research bridges protein structure and electrostatics with cell biology to reveal how pHi dynamics regulate cell behaviors though protonation of titrating amino acids as a post-translational modification to affect protein structure and function. Her group revealed design principles and functions of \"pH sensors\" described as endogenous proteins regulated within the cellular pH range, which they showed have critical roles in cell division, migration, and tumorigenesis. Additionally work from her group showed how increased pHi is necessary for adult and embryonic stem cell differentiation.

The research focuses on the relationship between the increased pHi and their ability to perform necessary functions. The laboratory group showed in molecular detail how it is necessary for the directed cell migration for metastasis. This was accomplished through the use of selective pH sensors that defined how proteins were regulated by cellular changes in pH. The group subsequently worked on the effect of increased pHi on the glycolytic enzymes necessary for metabolic programming, somatic mutation biology, and tumorigenic behaviors. The research uses optogenetic tools to control the pHi of the cells, biosensors that are genetically encoded to quantify the pHi of single cancer cells as well as cells in vivo, and computational programming to identify ionizable residues in proteins and amino acid mutation signatures that are present in numerous cancer databases.[9][10]/nThe second focus of Barber's laboratory is in stem cell differentiation, in collaboration with the laboratory of Todd Nystul.

She then spent a year researching at the Organization for Tropical Studies in Costa Rica through their program Tropical Biology: An Ecological Approach. In 1995, she received her PhD in Biology at University of Miami in the research group of herpetologist Jay M. Savage.[1] Her doctoral research centered on studying the population ecology of Isthmohyla calypsa\u2014a tree frog found only in the Talamancan mountains\u2014in the Reserva Protectora Las Tablas in Costa Rica. She moved to the region in 1991 and by 1993 observed that the population of these frogs had declined dramatically. She documented their population dynamics and breeding patterns in her dissertation, The population biology of Hyla calypsa, a stream-breeding treefrog from lower Central America.[2] During her graduate work, she also documented the disappearance of the toad Incilius fastidiosus, on the heals of the mysterious extinction of the golden toad.[3] While she initially did not have an explanation for the disappearances she'd observed, her graduate work\u2014combined with the observations of a number of amphibian ecologists\u2014eventually contributed to the identification of chytridiomycosis, an infectious disease that has wiped out amphibian populations around the world.[4][5]/nLips research primarily centers on understanding the ecological and environmental factors that influence how amphibian species respond to diseases in order to devise evidence-based strategies for conservation and recovery of endangered species. She and her collaborators also work to determine how human activities can contribute to the spread of diseases and the ultimate loss of biodiversity.[6]/nFollowing her PhD, Lips became an Assistant Professor at St. Lawrence University between 1995 and 1998. In that position, she returned to Costa Rica in 1996 and observed the overall abundance of frogs in the region was down 90%.[3] Her observations echoed those documented at a number of other ecological sites where amphibians were mysteriously dying off over the previous 15 years.[4] While some of the population decline could be attributed to habitat destruction, the areas Lips was researching were untouched and relatively unexplored environments. She moved her field research site to Fortuna, Costa Rica where she and her colleagues, including Rick Speare, found dead and dying frogs. They collected 50 dead frogs to send back to a veterinary pathologist in Maryland, who discovered that a protozoan of some sort had infiltrated their skin. With a team of collaborators, the protozoan was eventually identified as Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, or Bd, which belongs to a phylum of fungus called chytrids.[7][8] Amphibians drink and breathe by absorbing water and oxygen through their skin, but chytrids grow all over their bodies and interfere with their blood chemistry, leading to organ failure and eventual death. Since Bd was identified, it's been implicated in the collapse or extinction of over 200 amphibian species.[8]/nBetween 1998 and 2008, Lips was an Assistant, and later Associate, Professor at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. In 2004, her graduate students observed and began documenting a new chytrid outbreak in El Cop\u00e9, Panama.[9] In the wake of the outbreak, Lips and her colleagues in ecology and environmental conservation began evaluating the threat of such epidemics on biodiversity and discussing policy interventions.[10]/nStarting in 2008, Lips became a Professor at University of Maryland, College Park, where she currently serves as the Director of the Graduate Program in Sustainable Development and Conservation Biology.

He received his schooling at Driffield Board School and Bridlington Grammar School before graduating BSc (1913) and MSc (1914) from the University of Leeds.[3]/nAfter a stint in Kenya and the United States, where he got married, Dry returned to Leeds in 1921 and was awarded an Ackroyd Memorial Research Fellowship. This was a watershed moment in his career and laid the basis for his future research. For his PhD that followed, he made a study of the coat of the mouse. This research was published in 1926 and for many decades remained the definitive study of hair growth in mice.[4]/nAt this time Dry also became involved in research on the coats of sheep, a subject in which he would specialize for the rest of his career. In 1928 he was appointed as senior lecturer in agricultural zoology at the newly established Massey Agricultural College in Palmerston North, New Zealand. Here Dry focused his research on the problem wool producers were experiencing of having an excessive amount of hairy fibres (halo-hairs) in crossbred wool clip.[5]/nBy careful selective breeding of his control Romney flock of very hairy sheep at the college, Dry and his students proved that the prevalence of hairy fibres were determined genetically - specifically by the presence of a dominant N-gene. Following World War II, there was increased interest in Dry's sheep flock as it was discovered that hairy fibres were ideally suited for carpet production.[6]/nDry, by now an associate-professor, retired from Massey Agricultural College in 1956 and returned to the University of Leeds to occupy an honorary fellowship in the Department of Textile Industries. Here he proved the suitability of the wool of his sheep flock for carpet manufacturing. From 1961 to 1962 specialty carpet-wool production was set up at Massey Agricultural College to further investigate coarse wool fibres for carpet production. Dry's original sheep flock was further developed and the resulting new breed of sheep was named the Drysdale breed in his honor.[7][8]/nDry and his wife, Florence, returned to Palmerston North in 1963 and he continued his research on wool fibre. This led to the publication of The architecture of lambs' coats: a speculative study in 1975.[9]  For his considerable contribution to academia and research, Dry was given an honorary doctorate by Massey University in 1966 - the first time the university awarded this to a university lecturer.[10] In 1973 he received an OBE.[11]/nHe died in Palmerston North on 14 July 1979.[12]/n/nThis article about a New Zealand biologist is a stub.

In this role, he studied how stem cells self-renewed and how adult nerve stem cells become nerves. In 2006, he received the McKnight Scholar Award to help him establish an independent laboratory.[2] The following year, he led a research team that tracked the chemical signals received by newly made nerve cells in adult mice hippocampus.

In 2002, he shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with H. Robert Horvitz and Sir John E. Sulston.[11] Brenner made significant contributions to work on the genetic code, and other areas of molecular biology while working in the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England. He established the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism for the investigation of developmental biology,[12][16] and founded the Molecular Sciences Institute in Berkeley, California, United States.[17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24]/nBrenner was born in the town of Germiston in the then Transvaal (today in Gauteng), South Africa, on 13 January 1927.[3] His parents, Leah[25] (n\u00e9e Blecher) and Morris Brenner, were Jewish immigrants. His father, a cobbler, came to South Africa from Lithuania in 1910, and his mother from Riga, Latvia, in 1922. He had one sister, Phyllis.[26][27]/nHe was educated at Germiston High School[3] and the University of the Witwatersrand. Having joined university at the age of 15, it was noted during his second year that he would be too young to qualify for the practice of medicine at the conclusion of his six-year medical course, and he was therefore allowed to complete a Bachelor of Science degree in Anatomy and Physiology. During this time he was taught physical chemistry by Joel Mandelstam, microscopy by Alfred Oettle and neurology with Harold Daitz. He also received an introduction to anthropology and paleontology with Raymond Dart and Robert Broom. The histologist Joseph Gillman and director of research in the Anatomy Department convinced Brenner to continue towards an honours degree and beyond towards an MSc. Brenner accepted though this would mean he would not graduate from medical school and his bursary would be discontinued. He supported himself during this time by working as a laboratory technician. It was during this time, in 1945, that Brenner would publish his first scientific works. His master thesis was in the field of cytogenetics and publications during this time in the field Brenner would later call Cell Physiology.[26]/nIn 1946 Wilfred Le Gros Clark invited Brenner to his Department of Anatomy in Oxford, during a visit to South Africa. Brenner was persuaded to finish his medical education instead. Brenner returned to medical school where he failed Medicine, nearly failed Surgery and achieved a First Class in Obstetrics and Gynecology. Six months later Brenner had finished repeating Medicine and Surgery and in 1951 received the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBCh).[26]/nBrenner received an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 which enabled him to complete a Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil)[8] degree at the University of Oxford as a postgraduate student of Exeter College, Oxford, supervised by Cyril Hinshelwood.[28]/nFollowing his DPhil, Brenner did postdoctoral research at the University of California, Berkeley.[29] He spent the next 20 years at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology[30] in Cambridge. There, during the 1960s, he contributed to molecular biology, then an emerging field. In 1976 he joined the Salk Institute in California.[3]/nTogether with Jack Dunitz, Dorothy Hodgkin, Leslie Orgel, and Beryl M. Oughton, he was one of the first people in April 1953 to see the model of the structure of DNA, constructed by Francis Crick and James Watson; at the time he and the other scientists were working at the University of Oxford's Chemistry Department. All were impressed by the new DNA model, especially Brenner, who subsequently worked with Crick in the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge and the newly opened Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB). According to Beryl Oughton, later Rimmer, they all travelled together in two cars once Dorothy Hodgkin announced to them that they were off to Cambridge to see the model of the structure of DNA.[31]/nBrenner made several seminal contributions to the emerging field of molecular biology in the 1960s (see Phage group). The first was to prove that all overlapping genetic coding sequences were impossible. This insight separated the coding function from structural constraints as proposed in a clever code by George Gamow. This led Francis Crick to propose the concept of a hypothetical molecule  (later identified as transfer RNA or tRNA) that transfer the genetic information from RNA to proteins. Brenner gave the name \"adaptor hypothesis\" in 1955.[32] The physical separation between the anticodon and the amino acid on a tRNA is the basis for the unidirectional flow of information in coded biological systems. This is commonly known as the central dogma of molecular biology, i.e. information flows from nucleic acid to protein and never from protein to nucleic acid. Following this adaptor insight, Brenner conceived of the concept of messenger RNA during an April 1960 conversation with Crick and Fran\u00e7ois Jacob, and together with Jacob and Matthew Meselson went on to prove its existence later that summer.[33] Then, with Crick, Leslie Barnett, and Richard J. Watts-Tobin, Brenner genetically demonstrated the triplet nature of the code of protein translation through the Crick, Brenner, Barnett, Watts-Tobin et al. experiment of 1961,[34] which discovered frameshift mutations. Brenner collaborating with Sarabhai, Stretton and Bolle in 1964, using amber mutants defective in the bacteriophage T4D major head protein, showed that the nucleotide sequence of the gene is co-linear with the amino acid sequence of the encoded polypeptide chain.[35]/nTogether with the decoding work of Marshall Warren Nirenberg and others, the discovery of the triplet nature of the genetic code was critical to deciphering the code.[36] Barnett helped set up Sydney Brenner's laboratory in Singapore, many years later.[37][38]/nBrenner, with George Pieczenik,[39] created the first computer matrix analysis of nucleic acids using TRAC, which Brenner continued to use. Crick, Brenner, Klug and Pieczenik returned to their early work on deciphering the genetic code with a pioneering paper on the origin of protein synthesis, where constraints on mRNA and tRNA co-evolved allowing for a five-base interaction with a flip of the anticodon loop, and thereby creating a triplet code translating system without requiring a ribosome. This model requires a partially overlapping code.[40] The published scientific paper is extremely rare in that its collaborators include three authors who independently became Nobel laureates.[41]/nBrenner then focused on establishing a free-living roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism for the investigation of animal development including neural development. He chose this 1-millimeter-long soil roundworm mainly because it is simple, is easy to grow in bulk populations, and turned out to be quite convenient for genetic analysis. One of the key methods for identifying important function genes was the screen for roundworms that had some functional defect, such as being uncoordinated, leading to the identification of new sets of proteins, such as the set of UNC proteins. For this work, he shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with H. Robert Horvitz and John Sulston. The title of his Nobel lecture in December 2002, \"Nature's Gift to Science\", is a homage to this nematode; in it, he considered that having chosen the right organism turned out to be as important as having addressed the right problems to work on.[42] In fact, the C. elegans community has grown rapidly in recent decades with researchers working on a wide spectrum of problems.[43]/nBrenner founded the Molecular Sciences Institute in Berkeley, California in 1996.[5] As of 2015[update] he was associated with the Salk Institute, the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, the Singapore Biomedical Research Council, the Janelia Farm Research Campus, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.[5] In August 2005, Brenner was appointed president of the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology.[44] He was also on the Board of Scientific Governors at The Scripps Research Institute,[45] as well as being Professor of Genetics there.[4] A scientific biography of Brenner was written by Errol Friedberg in the US, for publication by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press in 2010.[20]/nKnown for his penetrating scientific insight and acerbic wit, Brenner, for many years, authored a regular column (\"Loose Ends\") in the journal Current Biology.[46][47] This column was so popular that \"Loose ends from Current Biology\", a compilation, was published by Current Biology Ltd.[48] and became a collectors' item.

Walsh championed the application of scientific methods to control agricultural pests. He was a proponent of biological control as an effective means to manage insects. He was also one of the first American scientists to support Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and was instrumental in securing its broad acceptance in the entomological community.[2]/nWalsh was born in Hackney, which was then a small village outside of London. The son of Benjamin Walsh  and Mary Bidwell Clarke, he was the fifth of thirteen children.[3] When Walsh was a boy, his father, a member of parliament, was charged with embezzlement and caught attempting to flee to America without his wife and children. He was jailed at Newgate and saved from hanging by a royal pardon issued in 1812.[3][4]/nAfter graduation from St. Paul's School in 1827, Walsh entered Trinity College, Cambridge, receiving a B.A. degree in 1831 and a master's degree three years later. In 1833 he became a fellow of Trinity, where he resided for 12 years with the intention of entering the Anglican ministry. A scholar of classic languages and literature, Walsh wrote The Comedies of Aristophanes, Translated into Corresponding English Metres (the first of an intended three volumes). In addition he showed an interest in journalism and wrote numerous articles for newspapers and periodicals./nWhile at Cambridge, Walsh developed a great dislike for religion and in particular came to despise the clergy as hypocrites and fools.[3][5] He was also critical of university policies and wrote a pamphlet in 1837, A Historical Account of the University of Cambridge and its Colleges, proposing changes that were considered radical at the time.[3] Eventually he became disillusioned with his career and left Cambridge./nWalsh married Rebecca Finn in 1838 and the couple emigrated to the United States. They settled in the remote and sparsely populated Henry County, Illinois, twenty miles from the nearest village. For the next twelve years, Walsh and his wife lived in a mud-plastered log cabin and farmed their 300-acre property.[6] His desire to live the solitary life of a philosopher-farmer came to an end when new settlements in the region brought about an outbreak of malaria. Worried for his health, Walsh moved to Rock Island, Illinois, in 1850 and started a successful lumber business.[3]/nAfter his move to Little Rock, Walsh became active in politics. As a Radical Republican he was opposed to slavery and frequently expressed his strong opinions in print.[1] He was actively involved in the fight to admit Kansas as a free state. In 1856 he helped to establish a local chapter of the Kansas Settlers Society which sought to encourage and support the settlement of Kansas by people who opposed slavery. In 1858 he suspected the Little Rock city council was embezzling city funds and in order to gain access to the financial records, he successfully campaigned for election to the council. Once the corruption was exposed he resigned his position.[1]/nAround 1858 Walsh sold his business and earned his living from a number of rental properties that he owned and managed. Although he had studied natural history and collected insects while at Cambridge, it was only at this point that he devoted himself full-time to entomology. By 1859 Walsh was lecturing on insects at the Illinois State Fair where he also displayed his collection of 1,650 insects he had recently collected.[7] In 1860 Walsh delivered a very well-received lecture on insect pests to the Illinois State Horticultural Society. Later he wrote several articles for various farm periodicals. Initially, perhaps influenced by his own farming experience, Walsh focused on the practical aspects of insects as agricultural pests. However, starting in 1862 he published several scholarly papers in the journals of scientific societies such as the Boston Society of Natural History and the Entomological Society of Philadelphia.  These works provided detailed observations of insect metamorphosis and natural history; compared morphological characters for a given taxon; or described new species.[3]/nIn his new-found career as an entomologist, Walsh was an active participant in several scientific societies.  In 1858 he became a founding member of the Illinois Natural History Society.  In 1861 he was elected a corresponding member of the Entomological Society of Philadelphia, and in 1863 he became a member of the Boston Society of Natural History. Walsh was also closely affiliated with the influential Illinois State Agricultural Society. It was this organization that successfully lobbied the state legislature to appoint Walsh as the first Illinois State Entomologist. In 1868 Illinois became only the second state to appoint an official entomologist. Although his official appointment was not ratified by the legislature until nearly a year later, Walsh began work immediately.[1]/nIn 1865 the Entomological Society of Philadelphia established a monthly periodical, the Practical Entomologist, the first American journal devoted to economic entomology. Walsh was appointed an associate editor and quickly became editor of the short-lived but influential publication.[8] In September 1868 Walsh became senior editor of The American Entomologist, with C.V. Riley as junior editor. Targeting farmers, this monthly journal featured illustrations and clear descriptions to help readers identify insect pests and apply the most effective controls. Two significant findings by Walsh and Riley appeared in this journal: the discovery of the 13-year form of the periodical cicada, and the first reference to mimicry of the North American monarch butterfly by the viceroy.[3]/nWalsh had been classmates with Charles Darwin at Cambridge and both received their baccalaureate degrees in 1831. Although not close friends, they were acquaintances, held a shared interest in natural history, and were mentored by two prominent Cambridge professors: geologist Adam Sedgwick and botanist John Henslow./nWalsh first read Darwin's On the Origin of Species in 1861. He had initially approached the book with skepticism but quickly became a convert to Darwin's theory and one of its most enthusiastic proponents. He later wrote to Darwin: \"Allow me to take this opportunity of thanking you for the publication of your Origin of Species... The first perusal staggered me, the second convinced me, and the oftener I read it the more convinced I am of the general soundness of your theory.\" This was the first letter in what became a regular correspondence. Over the next several years more than 30 letters were exchanged between them./nOnce Walsh became convinced of Darwin's theory, he championed the cause vigorously in the American scientific community through his lectures, publications and private correspondence. With Darwin's encouragement, he challenged the views of prominent opponents of evolution, including Louis Agassiz, Samuel Scudder, and Alpheus Packard. Within a few years, most entomologists (including Scudder and Packard) were expressing their support for evolutionary theory, while the remaining holdouts, like Agassiz, experienced a diminished reputation with their peers.[7]/nWalsh also incorporated evolutionary thinking into his own entomological studies and made several original contributions supporting Darwinism. In 1864 Walsh noted that 15 similar species of gall-inducing insects differed primarily in their preference for different species of willow. He went on to argue that these wasps shared a common ancestor that evolved into distinct species based on the species of willow they preferred. Walsh also investigated the phenomena of protective mimicry among insects and argued that it was best explained as an example of natural selection.[7] Darwin was delighted to learn of Walsh's studies and incorporated his findings in later editions of the Origin of Species./nWalsh died on November 18, 1869, from injuries sustained when struck by a train while walking along the tracks. He is buried in the Chippiannock Cemetery, Rock Island.[6] His insect collection, numbering 30,000 specimens, was purchased by the state of Illinois and stored in the \"fireproof\" facilities of the Chicago Academy of Sciences for safekeeping. Nevertheless, almost all of Walsh's collection was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.[9]/nWalsh authored 385 works during his career and co-authored an additional 478 works with Charles V. Riley.[10] Some of his more notable entomological works include:[3]", "66898244": "Pierre L\u00e9opold (born 6 May 1960) is a research director at the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research (Inserm) and a member of the Institut de France.

This work allowed him to identify a new cdk complex, cyclin C/Cdk8, involved in the function of the mediator, controlling transcription by polymerase II.[1][2] He also studied the function of another cdk complex, cyclin H/Cdk7, and its role in the initiation of zygotic transcription during the early development of Drosophila.[3]/nAfter returning to France, he and his team began to study mechanisms of organ and organismal growth in the Drosophila model. The approaches used by the team are at the frontier between genetics and physiology and address two major questions in the field of growth. Firstly, the team is interested in the mechanisms of growth induction by nutrition and highlighted the role of \"sentinel\" organs controlling growth in a systemic manner in response to nutritional information. This research uses genetic tools specific to the Drosophila model (unbiased genetic screens, loss of function by spatially targeted RNA-interference) to understand the inter-organ crosstalks and more particularly the endocrine relays existing between peripheral tissues and the central complex (brain/endocrine glands) where insulin/IGF and steroid hormones are produced. This work sheds light on how a nutritional signal (amino acid) activates the TOR kinase pathway in the fat body (functional equivalent of liver and adipose tissue in insects).[4] This activation in turn leads to the production of specific relay inducing the production of systemic insulin-like growth hormones/IGF by the brain.[5][6][7][8] This work also identifies functional interactions between growth hormones (insulin/IGF) and the steroid hormone (ecdysone) controlling the developmental program.[9]/nIn parallel to this line of research, the team is studying the mechanisms of growth coordination allowing the maintenance of organ proportions in response to a localized alteration of growth, as well as the coupling between tissue growth and the developmental progression. This recent work led to the identification of a hormonal mechanism predicted 30 years earlier allowing damaged tissues (genetic ablation or tumor growth) to act on the growth of other organs and to control the end of the juvenile period through the production of a relaxin-like hormone called Dilp8 and its receptor Lgr3 in the brain.[10][11][12]/nMore recently, the team's work has focused on the study of the genetic mechanisms of developmental precision allowing fine adjustment of growth parameters during development, with a particular focus on bilateral organs.[13]/nThe work of Pierre L\u00e9opold interrogates the normal physiology of biological systems, as well as the metabolic disturbances observed in response to altered hormone response pathways (insulin/IGF, steroids), tumor formation, or during tissue regeneration.", "70797644": "S Prakash Tiwari is an Indian biotechnologist, geneticist, agriculturalist and a former Deputy Director General of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR).[1][2] He was Vice-Chancellor of Swami Keshwanand Rajasthan Agricultural University, Bikaner,[3][4] and Director of National Academy of Agricultural Research Management (NAARM), Hyderabad.[5] He is also a former director of National Research Centre on Soybean, Indore.[6]/nDr. Tiwari, was born in Jabalpur and obtained his PhD in genetics from Indian Agriculture Research Institute and further completed postdoc from National Institute of Agricultural Botany, Cambridge, UK.[7]/nS Prakash Tiwari created a rapid method for plant anatomy using fluorescence microscopy in 1986.[8] He is known for this work on Soybean and identifying characteristic of Pod Anatomy associated with resistance to Pod-Shattering in Soybean.[9][10][11]/nIn 2005, Dr. Tiwari served as member of Exim Committee.[12]/nDr. Tiwari is currently in the Advisory Committee of Society for Soybean Research and Development.[13] He  was instrumental in preparing an in-depth report on the state of plant genetic resources available for food and agriculture for the FAO (United Nations).[14]/nDr. Tiwari served as chairman, Research Advisory Committee of Indian Institute of Soybean Research, Indore from 2016 to 2019.[15][16][17] He served as Chairman of the National Biodiversity Authority under the Ministry of Environment, Forests and climate change, Government of India, Expert Committee on Normally Traded Commodities from 2005 to 2007.[18] He also served as board member of Acharya N.

As a child during World War II, she spent time in a hillside village. She lived with her mother, father and three brothers: Paolo, Carlo and Marco. The part of her childhood that occurred after the war consisted of competing with her brothers on exhausting mountain hikes, roller skating in Piazzale Michelangelo, observing the entire beautiful city and long relaxing times in scenic settings like the Dolomites. Furthermore, Franzini-Armstrong strongly remembers the constant protection and affection that her twin brother showed her as they were growing up. [4]/nThroughout her years of schooling, Franzini-Armstrong always studied very hard.  She was driven, curious and very interested in the field of science.[4] Her parents were first-generation scientists. Franzini-Armstrong and her three brothers always knew that they wanted to pursue careers in science. Their father was an atomic physicist, and he was very passionate about teaching, especially regarding his children. Their mother was one of the very few women of that time who earned her physics degree.[4] Franzini-Armstrong's mother did not pursue a science career as she spent most of her time at home raising her four children. However, Franzini-Armstrong's mother always strongly encouraged her to pursue a science career. Franzini-Armstrong reports, \u201cShe [mother] gave me total equality with my brothers in all academic questions.\"[4] All three of Franzini-Armstrong's brothers pursued science careers. Her brother Paolo became a particle physicist; Carlo a medical physician who constructed the first interference microscope in Pisa; and Marco, an accomplished mineralogist. [4]/nIn 1956, Franzini-Armstrong enrolled in the biological sciences program at the University of Pisa, and she graduated with her Ph.D. degree in 1960. She was presented with numerous extraordinary opportunities at Pisa.[4] For instance, the Ministry of Education gave the first electron microscope to the University of Pisa, which allowed Franzini-Armstrong access to it and sparked her passion for microscopy. Moreover, Pathology Department Chair Puccinelli gave Franzini-Armstrong a book and sent her to Rome for multiple days to visit an EM lab, which gave her the chance to learn electron microscopy. She wrote her first EM thesis at the University of Pisa.[5]/nLater, Franzini-Armstrong was encouraged by Pellegrino, one of her professors, to study and observe changes induced by denervation on skeletal muscle. Ever since she has worked with skeletal and cardiac muscle during her electron microscopy studies.[5] She has continually conducted electron microscopy studies for the past 50 years. Additionally, Keith R. Porter offered Franzini-Armstrong postdoctoral training in his laboratory at Harvard University. She reports that this opportunity opened doors to an entirely new world of cell biology and advanced electron microscopy for her. Franzini-Armstrong described Porter as a very charismatic teacher and friend.[5] Her first large milestone discovery took place two weeks before she left the lab. The first major discovery of Franzini-Armstrong's was that transverse tubules open at the cell surface, and this is an essential discovery in understanding how muscle is activated to contract.[4]/nThere are numerous additional scientists that greatly helped and influenced Franzini-Armstrong's work, including Richard Podolsky, Sir Andrew Huxley, and Paul Horowitz.[4] From 1963 \u2013 1964, Franzini-Armstrong worked as Richard Podolsky's research assistant at the National Institutes of Health, and he improved her foundation on the physiology of muscle activation. From 1964 \u2013 1966, Franzini-Armstrong worked in Sir Andrew Huxley's lab, and there she began to fully comprehend contractile machinery and appreciate optics.[4] Additionally, she began to learn how to best deal with the difficulties that accompany the early stages of raising a family while working in the field of science. Moreover, from 1967 \u2013 1975, Paul Horowitz helped Franzini-Armstrong with her big transition from trainee to a faculty member at the University of Rochester. Horowitz provided her with the freedom to pursue a career in science without the responsibilities of committee work or heavy teaching while her children were still young.[6]/nFranzini-Armstrong's primary interest in science has been the disposition of membranes and macromolecular complexes that are responsible for excitation-contraction (e-c) coupling in cardiac and skeletal muscles.[6] She engaged in four main phases of structural work in terms of her career.  Her first phase focused on calcium cycling and, especially, on defining the distribution and nature of the two membrane systems involved in this specific type of cycling. Franzini-Armstrong's second phase discovered the location of channels that release calcium during muscle activation. She also demonstrated that in muscles that can engage in high activity rates, a limiting factor is the density of the pump protein and not the density of calcium release channels.[5] Furthermore, the third phase of Franzini-Armstrong's structural work recognized the relationship between the L type calcium channels of the plasmalemma and T tubules in cardiac and skeletal muscles. Specifically, she worked with CaV channels or dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) and the calcium release channels of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (RyRs).[5] Her fourth phase, which continues to be her current interest, is the supramolecular complex that enables several molecules located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum that regulate calcium release to interact with one another. In her current work, Franzini-Armstrong continues to utilize structural approaches in order to better comprehend the different interactions between molecules.[6]/nSimona Boncompagni, a researcher at the D'Annunzio University of Chieti\u2013Pescara in Italy describes Franzini-Armstrong as, \u201ca scientist with strong determination and humanity at the same time.\"[4] Boncompagni states, \u201cher [Franzini-Armstrong] career is characterized by high scientific achievements and immense productivity, but she is always open to new collaborations.\"[4] Paul Allen agrees as he explains, \u201con a bench at a Biophysical Society meeting 13 years ago, she single-handedly saved my career as a scientist and helped create one of the most successful multi-center group collaborations that ever existed. I knew who Clara was from her extraordinary reputation as the world\u2019s premier expert in muscle histology and ultra-structure. What I could not imagine was that she would want to collaborate with me!\"[4]/nFranzini-Armstrong earned multiple degrees and gained a great deal of professional experience throughout her many years of education and research.

Sherwin (1 December 1962\u00a0\u2013 18 July 2017) was an English veterinary scientist and senior research fellow at the University of Bristol Veterinary School in Lower Langford, Somerset.[3] He specialised in applied ethology, the study of the behaviour of animals in the context of their interactions with humans, and of how to balance the animals' needs with the demands placed on them by humans.[2][4][5]/nSherwin became known for his work on the welfare of animals in zoos, farms and laboratories, and in particular for his research into the behaviour of laboratory mice.[2][1][6][7] He created and chaired the Animal Ethics Committee of the International Society for Applied Ethology, and in 2003 was the lead author of its ethical guidelines.[2][8][9] He also served as secretary of the Ethical Committee of the Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. A colleague at Bristol described Sherwin as a \"stalwart advocate for animals and their welfare\".[2] In 2019 the RSPCA posthumously awarded Sherwin a Special Recognition Award: according to the Head of the RSPCA's Research Animals Department, \"Chris Sherwin\u2019s work influenced and assisted all of the RSPCA science departments, which deal with wildlife, research, companion and farmed animals\".[10]/nSherwin was born in Bradford, England, and spent several years in Australia, where he earned his BSc in veterinary biology from Murdoch University in Perth.[2][11] In 1987 he obtained his PhD, also from Murdoch University, for a thesis entitled Shading behaviour in sheep: The influence of social and thermal factors.[12]/nSherwin became a junior research fellow at the University of New England in Armidale, New South Wales, where he wrote about electronic tags and ear damage in pigs before returning to England in 1990.[2][13] That year he joined the Animal Welfare and Behaviour group at the University of Bristol Veterinary School to work on enriched housing for laying hens.[3] Sherwin worked at Bristol until he retired in 2012. During his two decades there, he became known for his research into improving the housing and husbandry of captive animals, and for his work on developing ethical guidelines for animal use.[2][3] He studied poultry in commercial facilities,[14] mice in laboratories,[7] elephants in zoos,[15] insect consciousness,[16] and the use of video to record farm animals' behaviour.[17][18]/nSherwin's studies included examining the behaviour of birds on farms and in laboratories. He wrote about housing for poultry used in meat and egg production.[19] Between 1998 and 2001 he published 11 papers on turkeys, which included examining the effect of lighting on their welfare; his research suggested that turkeys prefer brighter lights than those in commercial facilities.[20] In the early 2000s, he was a member of the European Council's Working Group for Birds, which wrote provisions for birds for the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes.[21] In a study for the RSPCA's \"Freedom Food\" label in 2009, he led a team from Bristol University that investigated stocking densities of hens used for eggs.[22] In 2010, Sherwin found a high incidence of broken bones in hens housed in a type of cage that was banned in the European Union soon afterwards.[14]/nFrom 2005 to 2007 Sherwin was part of a team funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the RSPCA, BIAZA, and IFAW to write a report concerning captive elephants: The Welfare, Housing and Husbandry of Elephants in UK Zoos (2008), about the 77 elephants then kept in 13 British zoos.[23][24][25] Sherwin told the BBC that almost half the elephants engaged in behaviour not seen in the wild, such as pacing, retracing their steps, and repeatedly swaying their trunks, which \"almost certainly indicates they're in an environment which is inappropriate for their needs\".[15] According to the report, 38 percent of the elephants the team examined performed these stereotypies for over one percent of the time during the day, and nearly half did so at night; during one 24-hour period, one  elephant stereotyped over 60 percent of the time.[26] In Sherwin's view, elephants could be kept in zoos with the correct housing and care, but not in the numbers seen at that time.[15]/nAnother of Sherwin's research interests was the complexity of invertebrate behaviour and their capacity to suffer pain.[2][27] He told Discovery News in 2009 that whether invertebrates experience pain was \"fundamental\" to the laws that protect animals and regulate their use.[28] Mike Mendl, a colleague of Sherwin's, wrote that Sherwin anticipated the interest in insect emotion and consciousness by over a decade.[2] According to Jonathan Balcombe, Sherwin challenged the traditional view of the insect as a \"spineless, pre-programmed automaton\".[29]/nSherwin reasoned that insects had preferences, habits, and memories, and could experience suffering as a \"negative mental state\".[29] That insects have different nervous systems and might perceive pain differently from vertebrates does not mean they lack consciousness.[27] When deciding whether an animal can suffer, he wrote in 2001, we compare its responses to those of evolutionarily higher animals, an argument by analogy, and find that invertebrates \"often behave in a strikingly analogous manner to vertebrates\".[a][30][31][32][33] He told a conference in 2000:/nIf a chimp pulls its hand away after an electric shock, we say she presumably must have felt an analogous subjective experience to what we call pain. But cockroaches, slugs and snails\u2014which are not protected by legislation\u2014also reacted in the same way, while tests on flies showed they could associate a smell with receiving an electric shock. If it is a chimp we say it feels pain, if a fly we don't. Why?[16]/nSherwin's most influential research was on the behaviour and welfare of laboratory mice.[2][6] In one highly cited study,[2] published in 1998, he built a device that allowed five mice to leave their cages\u2014by pressing levers to open the door\u2014for a loop that they could run around, a series of tunnels, or a wheel. Over time, they had to press the lever more often, up to 80 times, to gain access. Of the three options, the loop was the least preferred, and the wheel was \"least affected by increasing the cost of access\".[34][7][6] As a result of that research, Sherwin was awarded a Universities Federation for Animal Welfare (UFAW) Hume Research Fellowship in 2001.[1][35]/nHe went on to conduct extensive studies on laboratory cage design, showing that mice kept in ordinary cages chose to drink more of an anxiety-reducing drug than mice housed in larger cages with nesting material, a nest box, and a running wheel, where they could burrow and be with other mice.[36][6] He trained mice to open a lever to access cages with more space, varying how often the lever had to be pressed, and found that more space was something they were willing to work for.[37][6] He found that cage colour affected mouse welfare, including body weight; the mice liked white cages most and red least.[1][38] In another study, he demonstrated that mice need to engage in burrowing behaviour. Laboratory mice spent the same amount of time burrowing whether or not they were supplied with ready-made burrows. Sherwin used burrows constructed by the same mouse in an earlier part of the experiment, thereby addressing the argument that the mouse continued to burrow only because the ready-made burrows were inadequate.[39]/nSherwin wrote in 2004 that the behaviour and health of laboratory animals given standard housing and care are frequently abnormal, which may reduce the value of the data obtained from them.[40][41][2] The RSPCA quoted from his paper in a brochure discussing corporate social responsibility and \"the 3Rs\".[42] In 2007 he argued, in a letter to Nature, that it was good science to include details about the handling and housing of laboratory animals in published papers, because factors such as cage size and flooring can influence metabolism, temperature, blood pressure and feeding behaviour.[b]/nFrom 1998 to 2001 Sherwin sat on the Council of the International Society for Applied Ethology (ISAE).[44] He later chaired the ISAE's Animal Ethics Committee,[8] and was the lead author in 2003 of its ethical guidelines.[9] In 2006 he was the lead organizer of the 40th International Congress of the ISAE at Bristol. He also served as secretary of the Ethical Committee of the Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour,[2] and sat on the editorial board of the journal Animal Sentience.[45]\nHe was a member of the Joint Working Group on Refinement (JWGR), set up by the British Veterinary Association's Animal Welfare Foundation, FRAME, the RSPCA and UFAW, which produced a report on laboratory birds in 2001.[46][47]/nIn 2005 he sat on the European Food Safety Authority's (EFSA) working group on laboratory animals. Sherwin's team, led by Donald Broom, addressed the protection of invertebrates and animal fetuses. The assessment was adopted by the EFSA's Panel on Animal Health and Welfare in November 2005, which decided that animal fetuses should be given anaesthesia and analgesia for procedures that would cause pain in the newborn of the same species.[48]/nAfter his retirement, Sherwin became an editor on Wikipedia, where he wrote nearly fifty articles.[2]/nSherwin published over 62 works,[49] including:", "1493353": "Timothy Abbott Conrad[1] (June 21, 1803 in Trenton, New Jersey \u2013 August 9, 1877 in Trenton)[2] was an American geologist and malacologist./nHe was from early life an investigator of American paleontology and natural history, devoting himself to the study of the shells of the Tertiary and Cretaceous formations, and to existing species of mollusks.

He contributed many articles to the American Journal of Science and the Journal of the Philadelphia Academy of Science.[3]/nAs one of the New York state geologists he prepared the geological report for 1837. He was paleontologist of the New York Geological Survey from 1838 until 1841, and wrote the annual reports in that department. He also made the reports of paleontological discoveries in the Pacific Railroad Survey and the Mexican Boundary Survey.[3]/nHe defended the theory of periodical refrigeration, and suggested that the Mississippi depression was the consequence of the upheaval of the Appalachians and the later elevation of the area of the Rocky Mountains.

She researches the relationship between organismal physiological and life history features and response to global climate change.[1]/nLauren Buckley grew up on Conanicut Island, Rhode Island. She developed an early interest in biology while exploring her home island with her parents, both marine biologists.[2]/nBuckley earned her Bachelor of Arts in biology and mathematics (honors) at Williams College in 2000. She conducted research as a graduate student at Stanford University, where she earned her PhD in 2005. Following her time at Stanford, Buckley pursued postdoctoral fellowships at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) and the Santa Fe Institute.[3][4]  Buckley became an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, a position she held from 2009 to 2013. In 2013, she joined the faculty at the University of Washington Department of Biology, and has been a professor from 2019 onward. Her lab, Buckley Lab, is affiliated with the University of Washington, and conducts research on the adaptive and ecological responses of organisms to global climate change.[5]/nBuckley's work has focused on improving the modeling and forecasting of organismal responses to climate change by integrating field and experimental data. She has demonstrated that the most commonly used models in climate change research are insufficient predictors of species and population behavior, as they neglect essential features such as thermal physiology, behavior, size, and abiotic constraints, all of which factor into species fitness and performance. The mechanistic species distribution models she has developed incorporate essential aspects of species biology to improve predictions and assess the generalizability of certain phenotypes to other systems.[6] Another central concern these modeling improvements seek to address is a how much organisms will be able to move to adapt to changing climate patterns, and how this ability changes given an array of biotic and abiotic variables.[7]/nBuckley has utilized a variety of systems to study the responses of ectotherms to climate and weather patterns. Beginning with her dissertation, Buckley\u2019s early research focused heavily on insular lizard population dynamics. Through the study of island lizard populations, she has documented the impact of energy constraints as key limiting factors to the density, abundance, and community structure of ectotherm populations. She has also studied and described the importance of incorporating physiological and life history features into models when predicting the range constraints and shifts of species.[8]/nHer more recent research has focused insect systems where historical data can be used to test predictions of responses to climate change. In particular, she focuses on the fitness implications of climate change for a species, given its biological and ecological features, which are often-overlooked components of climate change research. Her work has been instrumental in clarifying the performance and fitness consequences of thermal stress for ectotherm species, and brought attention to the particular vulnerability of mid-latitude species to climate change.[9] Buckley has also analyzed the influence of a number of variables on a given species' ability to respond to climate change, especially thermal developmental plasticity. Further, she has drawn important connections between developmental plasticity and maladaptive phenological shifts that may reduce fitness and disrupt ecological interactions, as well as the role of plasticity in attenuating climate change impacts.[10][11] Her primary insect study systems are Colias butterflies and grasshopper communities in Colorado.[1]/nBuckley teaches undergraduate biology courses at the University of Washington, including BIOL 315: Biological Impacts of Climate Change and BIOL 421: Ecological and Evolutionary Physiology of Animals. Her classes align with her research, emphasizing the interactions between biology and climate change.[12]/nBuckley received an NSF CAREER grant to pursue the development of the Translating Environmental Change (TrEnCh) project.[13] The goal of the TrEnCh project is to develop tools for visualizing the impact and response of environmental and climate change on organisms. It offers open-source, high-resolution data for sophisticated modeling and forecasting with greater detail and accuracy than traditional models that use general parameters. The project integrates a variety of open-source historical and observational data to promote dissemination of the material, and to connect the public to accessible means of understanding climate effects. One of the tools available through the project is TrenchR, a package for organismal energy modeling using the R programming language.[14] The TrEnCh project also uses infrared imaging to better collect data on the thermal conditions of ectotherms, and elucidate the possible resulting climate change impacts on thermally-sensitive processes./nThe TrEnCh-ed portion of the project is designed to allow students to interact with data and observe climate-related correlations in organismal responses.[14]", "66013566": "Jan Elnor Leach (born 1953) is an American plant pathologist.

Weitz is a chronobiologist and neurobiologist whose work primarily focuses on studying the molecular biology and genetics of circadian clocks./nAt Harvard University, the Weitz lab consolidated understanding towards the transcriptional architecture of the circadian clock in Drosophila and mice models. He determined the role of the CLOCK protein, which serves to activate transcription of circadian clock genes.[1] The Weitz lab is also accredited for discovering direct transcription termination by the PER complex, which regulates the expression of genes involved in producing the circadian rhythm./nCurrently, Weitz's work focuses on using cryo-electron microscopy to study endogenous circadian protein complexes.[2]/nCharles J. Weitz earned his undergraduate degree in Philosophy from Harvard University in 1978.[3]/nHe received his medical degree from the Stanford University School of Medicine in 1983. After medical school, he completed his internship in surgery/neurosurgery in 1984 at Stanford University School of Medicine. After pursuing medicine, Weitz decided to focus more on research and obtained a Ph.D. in Neuroscience from Stanford University School of Medicine in 1988. He completed his postdoctoral research under the guidance of Dr. Jeremy Nathans from 1988 to 1993 in Molecular Biology and Genetics at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine where his work focused on photoreception, investigating the genetic and molecular basis for human tritanopia.[4][5]/nWeitz went into teaching and currently holds the position of Robert Henry Pfeiffer Professor of Neurobiology, where he teaches graduate-level courses, including the Molecular Biology of Mammalian Circadian Clocks.[6][7]/nIn 1998, Weitz was one of many who helped contribute to the discovery of the role of CLOCK in feedback regulation occurring in the Drosophila model. The genes period (per) and timeless (tim) are two important genes involved in the biological clock of Drosophila. The mRNA expression of both genes occurs in circadian rhythms with approximately 24 hour periods.[1]/nWeitz and colleagues first identified dCLOCK, the Drosophila homolog of the mouse CLOCK protein. After this step, they were able to determine the protein product of dCLOCK could activate per and tim transcription. Through an E-box located on the promoters of per and tim, the proteins dCLOCK and BMAL1 are able to induce the expression of per and tim. Eventually, the protein products PERIOD and TIMELESS accumulate inside the nucleus. It is there where they inhibit the transcription activity of CLOCK at their promoters, thus forming a negative feedback loop.[1]/nWeitz also was among some of the scientists who helped to discover the role of the CLOCK protein in the mammalian circadian mechanism. Previously, the specific mechanism of how CLOCK controls and influences circadian rhythms was unknown. The research of circadian mechanisms in mammals indicated that CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimers serve to activate the transcription of circadian clock genes such as mper1. Specifically, the heterodimers bind to E-box elements to activate transcription. A mutant CLOCK was still able to form heterodimers with BMAL1 and able to bind DNA. However, the mutation prevented activation of transcription, which indicates that CLOCK is important for the transcriptional activation of genes such as per which play a role in circadian rhythms.[8]/nIn Drosophila, CRY functions as a circadian photoreceptor by binding to TIM and inhibiting the PER-TIM negative feedback loop in response to light. However, genetic evidence has suggested that CRY may have a different role in mammals. Weitz, Griffin Jr., and Staknis investigated this hypothesis in 1999 and discovered that the two CRY homologs, CRY1 and CRY2, negatively regulate Per1 transcription by inhibiting the CLOCK-BMAL1 complex, independent of light. The regulation of Per1 is crucial for maintaining the rhythms of various physiological processes in organisms. This finding distinguishes the role of mammalian CRYs from Drosophila CRYs, which suggests that Drosophila CRYs serve as ancestral photoreceptors that act as light-dependent regulators of the circadian feedback loop, while mammalian CRYs have retained their role within the circadian feedback loop but have lost their direct photoreceptor function.[9]/nThe results of Weitz and his colleagues have allowed for further investigations into the molecular mechanisms of circadian clocks. In a 2001 study by various researchers, altered behavioral rhythms and clock gene expression were observed in mice whose Period1 (Per1) gene was inactivated. This results of Weitz\u2019s study allowed them to conclude Per1 plays an important role in peripheral and output pathways of the circadian clock.[10] Another example is a 2000 study conducted by researchers at Medical College of Wisconsin. Using the conclusions made by Weitz\u2019s 1999 paper, the researchers were able to use the information that changes in the level of Period2 are expected to alter levels of other clock genes, affecting the clock\u2019s phase.[11]/nCircadian rhythms are regulated by a transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL). In mammals, this process is crucially associated with the PER complex, formed by the combined complex of three PER and two CRY proteins. As the PER complex inhibits the expression of PER and CRY, the accumulation and degradation of the PER complex creates a negative feedback loop that helps to regulate the expression of genes involved in producing the circadian rhythm.[12]/nIn 2012, Weitz, with his two lab members Kiran Padmanabhan and Maria S. Robles, investigated the feedback regulation by the PER complex. In the mouse model, they found that the PER complex contains a helicase that promotes transcriptional termination, SETX.[13] During the negative feedback loop, RNA polymerase II accumulates near termination sites on PER and CRY genes, promoting transcription of the genes.[13] As the PER complex is produced, the SETX interacts with the accumulated RNA polymerase II, blocking its release and inhibiting further transcription of the PER and CRY genes.[13] This discovery solidified insight into how PER proteins may repress clock-controlled target genes directly, contributing to future studies of the circadian clock's transcriptional architecture.[12]/nCryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a cutting-edge technique that determines the three-dimensional structure of large molecules at high resolution.[14] As it reveals the structures of biomolecules previously difficult to study using traditional methods (see X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy), cryo-EM is useful for gaining new insights into the structures and functions of biomolecules.[14]/nIn 2017, Weitz, alongside Rajindra Aryal, Pieter Bas Kwak, Alfred Tamayo and Michael Gebert, applied this technique to enrich the understanding of the mammalian circadian clock. They deciphered macromolecular compositions of the circadian feedback loop, as well as internal structural properties of the clock\u2019s function.[2] It was discovered that the PER complexes exhibited quasi-spherical structures, featuring globular domains that were connected by flexible linkers.[2] In the cytoplasm, GAPVD1, a cytoplasmic trafficking factor, regulates a system of complexes involved in producing a circadian rhythm.[2]/nIn 2002, Weitz contributed to the research on how circadian gene regulation works in peripheral tissues. The results of the study showed that the circadian phases of the genes in the liver and heart were different from each other. However, the circadian genes in these two tissues affect overlapping biological processes, as indicated by a comparative analysis done by the researchers.[15]/nIn a 2008 paper, Katja A. Lamia, Kai-Florian Storch along with Charles Weitz discovered that a liver specific mutation to the Bmal1 gene results in low glucose levels during the fasting period of the mices\u2019 feeding cycle. It was also discovered that there was excess glucose usage and loss of rhythmicity in the glucose regulation genes of the liver. This led to the understanding that the liver clock is important for glucose circulation and for rhythmicity of glucose export and ingestion.[16]", "33081774": "Peter Henry Andrews Sneath FRS,[1] MD (17 November 1923 \u2013 September 9, 2011) was a microbiologist who co-founded the field of numerical taxonomy, together with Robert R.

Following the 1958 14 July Revolution that overthrew the Hashemite monarchy in Iraq he returned to Egypt to work for the Galenus Pharmaceutical Laboratories in Giza near Cairo. In 1960 he was based in Gaza in Palestine, at the time part of the United Arab Republic. It is unclear whether his frequent relocations were related to the conflict between the Egyptian government and the Muslim Brotherhood, that led many members of the brotherhood to seek sanctuary in Saudi Arabia, among them Said Ramadan. He was at one point accused of being a Russian spy when living in Iraq, and was later described as having ties to several intelligence services.[1]/nDuring the 1950s and 1960s Egypt and Syria moved in a socialist direction, and as a result West Germany decided to accept political refugees from these countries. Thousands of Arab students and scholars moved to West Germany in the 1950s and 1960s. As part of this wave of political refugees, Mufti\u0107 moved from Gaza to West Germany in 1962 to work for the Tuberculosis Research Institute in Schleswig-Holstein. He then became a researcher at Schering AG in West Berlin, where he became director of the bacteriological department. He also held a secondary appointment at the Biochemical Laboratory at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland.[5] He moved to Geneva in the late 1960s.[1] He also had ties to the United Kingdom, especially as part of his political work, and spent much time in London. At the time of his death he was affiliated with the Biochemistry Department at Trinity College, Dublin./nMufti\u0107's main research interests were medical microbiology and hypnosis. He published around 40 papers in medical journals. He was also a co-inventor of several patents held by Schering. He also wrote articles on Yugoslav politics, the Middle East conflict and Islamic theology. He was also interested in experimental or parapsychological topics; building upon the work of Walter John Kilner and under the sponsorship of the Metaphysical Research Group of the United Kingdom, he published a book on aura phenomena, based on research he carried out in the 1950s on the human energy field with a device utilizing a semiconductor and an electroluminescent panel called an optron.[6]/nMufti\u0107 discovered and named a species of yeastlike fungus, blastomyces cerolytica.[7][8] His author abbreviation in botany is \"Muftic.\"[9]/nHe was a Fellow of the American Institute of Hypnosis, an institution founded by his \"long time personal and professional friend\"[2] William Joseph Bryan, whose work notably found use in psychological warfare during the Cold War. According to Bryan, Mufti\u0107 was \"a true scientist in every way [who] always looked for physical and chemical explanations of psychological problems. He frequently took as his motto Gerard's famous statement, 'there can be no twisted thought without a twisted molecule.'\"[2]/nMufti\u0107 was a close confidant of his wife's relative Said Ramadan since the time he was living in Egypt, and through this family connection to the founding family of the Muslim Brotherhood he became involved with the brotherhood's activities. Mufti\u0107's political activity took place in the intersection of pan-Islamism and anti-communism. At the time Said Ramadan was the main U.S. intelligence asset among Muslim leaders, as the CIA sought to use the cause of pan-Islamism to fight communism.[10] Mufti\u0107's political agenda was complex, and according to Ivo Mi\u0161ur it is unclear if he involved himself with Croatian nationalism in order to promote Islamism or vice versa.[4] Mufti\u0107 was a member of the executive of the Croatian National Resistance from 1960 to 1964, and was singularly responsible for the cooperation between that organisation and the Muslim Brotherhood in the early 1960s.[11][4] He was also heavily involved in the negotiations with Saudi Arabia for the formal recognition of the exiled Croatian state, in order to secure Saudi material assistance in \"the fight against communism and for the liberation of Croatia,\" and in the dialogue between Croatian emigrant circles and the Muslim world in general.[4] He was the Yugoslav delegate to the World Muslim Congress in 1962.[12] The establishment of combat sections within the Muslim Brotherhood and the attempt to recruit exiled Bosnians for the cause of the brotherhood was his idea.[4] As a result of various personal conflicts within both organizations he withdrew from the leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Croatian National Resistance in 1964.[4] His withdrawal from Croatian emigrant circles took place at a time when a separate Bosnian Muslim (Bosniak) national consciousness was starting to gain traction.[4]/nHe is said to have been killed or poisoned in a hotel in London in 1971, supposedly because his killers suspected him of being a Mossad agent.[4]", "6736310": "George Charles Wallich (16 November 1815 \u2013 31 March 1899) was a British medical doctor, marine biologist and professional photographer.

Her work focuses particularly on measuring the effect of microbial and chemical contaminants in sewage sludge and the safe reuse of biosolids as fertilizer by the planting of native trees to filter and inactivate pollutants from the sludge and the use of vermiculture. Horswell is involved in consultation with communities in New Zealand and has contributed to official guidelines for the management of biosolids. Her research has also provided information about soil microbial communities for forensic science using microbial cultures and DNA sequencing.  Since 2018, Horswell has been a lecturer at Massey University./nHorswell completed an undergraduate biology degree at the University of Bath and PhD in microbiology at the University of Aberdeen in 1997. Her PhD thesis was titled Investigation of approaches to accelerate atrazine mineralisation in soil.[1]/nHorswell moved to New Zealand in 1997 and took up a position as Scientist, Environmental Health Effects, at the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR).[2] In 2008 she took over the biowaste  programme at ESR, which later set up and ran the virtual Centre for Integrated Bio Waste Research (CIBR), a collaboration between ESR, Scion, Landcare Research and the Cawthron Institute, to study options for safely and sustainably reusing biodegradable waste.[3]\nWith Horswell as its first programme leader, CIBR was officially launched in 2013 with the purpose of researching how to deal with organic waste,  \"to make sure, that when it goes on land, this is done safely and does not impact the environment\".[4]:\u200ap.67\u200a In July 2018 Horswell left ESR, and her role as Programme Manager for CIBR to become a Senior Lecturer in Water and Waste in the school of Health Sciences at Massey University, Wellington.[3][5]/nBefore coming to New Zealand, Horswell worked with Professor Graeme Paton at the University of Aberdeen on biosensor technology involving organisms that can determine whether toxic material is present in soil and identify when sites may have been contaminated by industry or agriculture and when they have been cleaned up. Specifically used in the research was the soil bacterium Rhizobium which because it was sensitive to heavy metals in the soil, could indicate on a biosensor light whether or not the soil was healthy. She applied this knowledge early in her time with ESR, in particular determining the impact of heavy metals in sewage sludge on microbes in the soil. [4]:\u200ap.66/nIn 2000 Horswell was commissioned to do a report for the New Zealand Ministry of Health, Ministry for the Environment and Industry on the bioavailability of organic forms of arsenic to plants, and ultimately people in the soil-plant-human route, as a result of its use in the treatment of timber. The report which was a review of the literature, concluded that because salts of copper, chromium and arsenic have been used in New Zealand on the preservation of wood, \"treatment sites can become highly contaminated with these metals, especially arsenate\".[6]/nThe possible re-use of biosolids as fertilizer has been a key area of study for Horswell and in 2008, she recommended research priorities to the 2008 Annual Conference of the New Zealand Land Treatment Collective. Some of the key recommendations for potential projects included: \"Environmental fate of biosolids and effluent-borne pathogens in sewage treatment systems...[monitoring]...source control of nutrients i.e. washing powder etc...[determining the]...effect of emerging contaminants such as endocrine inhibitors and pharmaceuticals on the environment.[7]/nA 2009 study, in which Horswell was involved, investigated the degree that sludge-born pathogen organisms survive and are transported in soils and affect surrounding water. The paper noted the importance of sewage treatment and disposal in protecting a community from pathogens  and that while sewage sludge is a valuable resource with plant nutrients that can be directly applied to land as fertilizer, and pathogen numbers are reduced during sludge processing, it is unlikely that they can be completely eliminated, and need to be controlled via \"guidelines and regulations that set criteria for levels of pathogens, which are protective of the environment and human health.\"[8]/nIn 2017, Horswell participated in research looking at the possible use of biosolids to reforest areas where the soil had been degraded. The thesis was that because many New Zealand native plant species thrive in low-fertility soils, they may respond well to biosolids which would, in turn, improve the soil microbial activity. The report concluded that after adding biosolids to the soil, all the NZ-native species showed either improved growth or an increase in nutrient status, but cautioned that further testing was required to investigate the possible long-term effects of this.[9]/nHorswell co-authored a research report that evaluated the evidence that blending biosolids with organic materials could reduce the environmental impact on the soils and concluded that while it is not always a viable solution, \"combining biosolids with other organic wastes to rehabilitate degraded land remains a potentially practicable and sustainable management of these resources.\"[10]/nHorswell participated in research led by ESR scientist Jennifer Prosser in 2014 that explored the possibilities of growing plants with antiseptic properties in soils contaminated with waste, mitigating the release of microbial contaminants into the environment. After studying two myrtaceous plants, Leptospermum scoparium,  and \n(Kunzea robusta), in this context, the researchers concluded that there was evidence that such plant species \"may help reduce microbial contaminants in land-applied organic wastes.\"[11]\nReflecting later on the research, Horswell commented: \"Discovering that m\u0101nuka\u2019s antimicrobial properties could help with water pollution was an exciting moment.  M\u0101nuka seems to actively do something beyond just sieving out the pathogens, so if we were to plant it (or k\u0101nuka) along our waterways, as they used to do, we might see an improvement in the health of our rivers and lakes.\"[4]:\u200ap.66/nFollowing the release by the New Zealand Ministry for the Environment of Our Fresh Water 2017,[12] which had concerns about the runoff of wastes into waterways, the work by Horswell and other scientists from ESR was acknowledged for providing information that would potentially enable the filtering nitrates and deactivation of pollutants to improve water quality.[13]/nIn 2017 when a polluted New Zealand lake in Te Kauwhata became part of a collaborative manuka-planting research initiative to help restore the water quality, the project was tested in a laboratory by the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR). Horswell said it was the first time this resource had come from the laboratory to the land and it was a step toward the restoration of the lake that had involved the whole community and research students from the USA.[14][15]/nHorswell has been involved in studies to evaluate the effectiveness of vermicomposting in reducing pathogens in biosolids while still retaining beneficial nutrients and organic carbon. One study, focused on a small rural settlement in New Zealand, had the aims of examining the biological and chemical property change over the time of vermicomposting, identifying useful indicators of timing compost maturity and the determination of whether vermicomposting could produce a high value, pathogen-free product for small communities interested in recycling or reusing their waste. The study concluded that \"vermicomposting has the potential to transform septic tank waste  into high-value compost as it is effective in stabilizing nutrients and reducing pathogens.\"[16] Another research paper co-authored by Horswell in 2017, noted in the Abstract: \"Biosolids can be a valuable fertilizer for agriculture and in ecological restoration, although there are concerns about contaminants. Earthworm activity, including vermicomposting of biosolids, may influence the efficacy of their use.\"[17]/nIn 2015 Horswell noted that CIBR and the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA), had begun collaborating with the community and the Gisborne District Council to review the effectiveness of the Biological Trickling Filter (BTF) that had been in use in the area since 2011.  They also investigated the potential for a wetlands treatment system, using native plant species, as an alternative method of disposal of the treated effluent and biosolids.[18]:\u200ap.1\u200a In the same publication Staci Boyte explained that the eventual aim of the project was to eliminate the discharge of human effluent to the sea, but stressed the possibility of  a \"wetland treatment system and sludge drying beds to treat and re-use the waste, eliminating the discharge of waste to the sea and potentially provide a useful soil conditioner.\"[18]:\u200ap.3\u200a The Gisborne Herald reported in December 2015, that good progress was being made with the trial and the next stage would be using algal ponds to determine if the system could be used to treat the wastewater after it had been through the Biological Trickling Filter BTF plant.[19]/nEngaging with communities has driven much of the research for developing frameworks for the management of biowastes, and in 2016 Horswell co-authored a Community Engagement Framework for Biowastes to assist waste producers and councils to effectively consult with their communities about the discharge of biowastes to land in New Zealand. In this framework, biowastes are defined as \"solid and liquid organic biodegradable waste, including biosolids, organic industrial waste, agricultural waste, kitchen/food waste, green waste, sewage effluent and greywater.\" The report noted that to get shared understandings and buy-in from stakeholders, social, cultural and economic factors all needed to be considered so that there was alignment between community values and the technicalities of the process. [20]:\u200ap.1\u200a Some of the key guidelines for successful engagement included careful planning and scheduling, getting a good representation of stakeholders, in particular, inviting local Iwi representatives to become involved and ensure that there is \"warm hosting and sharing of food.\"[20]:\u200ap.11/nCultural views of Maori about the management of biowastes were published in a paper in March 2016.  Horswell was part of the team that wrote this document to provide insight into how the traditional constructs of tapu and noa could be considered in biowaste management, in particular for biosolids. The purpose of the document was to \"support local government staff and engineers in better understanding and incorporating Maori worldviews into biowaste management negotiations and solutions.\"[21]\nIn 2017, Horswell led another collaborative three-year project with councils that aimed to develop a collective biosolids strategy and use the programme in the lower North Island. The paper, co-authored by Horswell, did not see landfilling of biosolids as a viable long-term option and determined that the best approach was to identify the scale of the problem, explore opportunities to work together and assess feasible scenarios that could inform the implementation of an effective strategy. The aim was that this would provide a \"basis for sustainable  biosolids management in other regions of New Zealand, national guidelines and policy directions.\"[22] The project was reviewed in 2020 and concluded it had shown that biosolids can be beneficially reused  through collective management, noting that the keys to success are for Regional Councils to streamline consenting and the building of \"positive relationships between Iwi and Council, and maintaining an understanding around wider issues occurring within the region that may have an influence on local Iwi's current perspectives.\"[23]  Horswell was one of the reviewers./nHorswell's research has had implications for forensic science. In 2002, she contributed to an investigation that showed a soil microbial community DNA profile could be determined from a small sample of soil off shoes or clothing, and could potentially be used as \"associative evidence to prove a link between suspects and crime scenes.\"[24] New Zealand journalist Kim Griggs, writing in the Guardian, explained that once the DNA from the bacteria in the soil is extracted, a biological photocopier could be used by forensic scientists to make copies of the DNA of the 16S rRNA gene and look for matching samples at a given site, with the aim of solving crimes using an understanding of soil and the bugs within it as a new \"fingerprint\".[25] As a result of this research, The University of Tennessee Forensic Anthropology Facility, which studies what happens to human bodies after they die, worked with ESR on studying the bacteria that the body produces as it decomposes, hypothesizing that certain bugs - either from the decomposing body or those already in the soil - will create a bacteria timeline to estimate the time of death.[25] Horswell also led research that investigated using biosensors to detect chemicals or inorganic poisons in urine and this received international praise because it could help forensic laboratories speedily determine whether or not poison was a cause of death.[26] The preliminary findings were published in 2006, with the Abstract noting: \"This study demonstrates that biosensor bioassays could be a useful preliminary screening tool in forensic toxicology.\"[27] In 2012 Horswell was asked about the  feasibility of DNA sequencing of microbial soil DNA to point to  locations in forensic work.  She said that a study had shown there was a 90% chance of matching microbes in  soil on a shoe and those in the shoe print, and although it was more complicated, it was possible to \"profile the  dirt on a spade and or in the boot of a suspect's car and determine where to dig to find the body that had been buried.\"[28]/nIn 2004 Horswell's presentation Development of bacterial biosensors to detect poisons and drugs in toxicological samples was a certificate winner for the Best Overall Oral Presentation at the Symposium of the Australia and New Zealand Forensic Science Society.[29]", "74467808": "Jean Pennycook is an American educator and zoologist specializing in Antarctic Ad\u00e9lie penguins.[1] She is based in Cape Royds, an Antarctic Specially Protected Area which hosts a stable population of Ad\u00e9lie penguins.[2][3]/nPennycook first came to Antarctica in 1999 as part of a team from the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, who were researching Mount Erebus, a volcano on Ross Island.[4] She publicized scientific research in Antarctica using several science outreach methods, including online journal entries and postcards, video conferences with schoolchildren, and a documentary about the effect of climate change on penguins.[4][5] Pennycook and her fellow researcher David Ainley run an educational website, Penguin Science, which summarizes the research team's work and aims to attract future scientists to the field.[6][7] Pennycook has supervised interns in the Polar Internship Program, which aims to enable students of underrepresented racial or social groups to visit Antarctica and become familiarized with Antarctic scientific research.[7][8]/nPennycook created an outreach project where schoolchildren could send personalized postcards with drawings of penguins sent to her, which would then be returned with an Antarctic postmark.[2][7] Schools also have the option of designing a class flag to be flown in Antarctica, which can subsequently be viewed through a live penguin webcam on the research team's website.[6][9]", "40520160": "Natalya Melik Melikyan (Armenian: \u0546\u0561\u057f\u0561\u056c\u0575\u0561 \u0544\u0565\u056c\u056b\u0584\u056b \u0544\u0565\u056c\u056b\u0584\u0575\u0561\u0576) (May 20, 1906 \u2013 July 25, 1989) was an Armenian scientist./nNatalya Melikyan (Ter-Meliksetyan) was born on May 20, 1906, in the Murshudali Armenian-populated village of the Surmalinsky Uyezd, Erivan Governorate of the Russian Empire.

In addition to work in agronomy, Bakewell is particularly notable as the first to implement systematic selective breeding of livestock. His advancements not only led to specific improvements in sheep, cattle and horses, but contributed to general knowledge of artificial selection.[1]/nRobert Bakewell, the second eldest son,[2] was born on 23 May 1725 at Dishley Grange, near Loughborough in Leicestershire. As a young man he travelled extensively in Europe and Britain, learning about other farming methods.  Others interested in his work included Prince Grigory Potemkin and Fran\u00e7ois de la Rochefoucauld (1765\u20131848)./nHe supported his revolutionary new breeding techniques with grassland irrigation, flooding and fertilizing pasturelands to improve grazing. He taught these practices to many farmers, and in 1783 formed The Dishley Society to promote them and to advance the interests of livestock breeders. His apprentices and contemporaries, especially Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester, used his methods to continue improvements to British livestock long after his death in October 1795.[1]/nArguably the most influential of Bakewell's breeding programs was with sheep. Using native stock, he was able to quickly select for large, yet fine-boned sheep, with long, lustrous wool. The Lincoln Longwool was improved by Bakewell, and in turn the Lincoln was used to develop the subsequent breed, named the New (or Dishley) Leicester. It was hornless and had a square, meaty body with straight top lines.[3]/nThese sheep were exported widely, including to Australia and North America, and have contributed to numerous modern breeds, despite the fact that they fell quickly out of favour as market preferences in meat and textiles changed. Bloodlines of these original New Leicesters survive today as the English Leicester (or Leicester Longwool), which is primarily kept for wool production./nHe crossed long-horned heifers and a Westmoreland bull to eventually create the Dishley Longhorn. As more and more farmers followed his lead, farm animals increased dramatically in size and quality. In 1700, the average weight of a bull sold for slaughter was 370 pounds (168\u00a0kg). By 1786, that weight had more than doubled to 840 pounds (381\u00a0kg)[citation needed]. However, after his death, the Dishley Longhorn was replaced with short-horn versions./nRobert Bakewell bred the Improved Black Cart horse, which later became a Shire horse.[4]/nSeveral buildings in Loughborough are named after Bakewell including a hall of residence at Loughborough University and a primary school in the town.[5]/nSelective breeding, which Charles Darwin described as artificial selection, was an inspiration for his theory of natural selection. In On the Origin of Species he cited Bakewell's work as demonstrating variation under domestication, in which methodical breeding during Bakewell's lifetime led to considerable modification of the forms and qualities of his cattle, and the unconscious production of two distinct strains when two flocks of Leicester sheep were kept by Mr. Buckley and Mr. Burgess, \"purely bred from the original stock of Mr. Bakewell for upwards of fifty years\"[6] with the unanticipated result that \"the difference between the sheep possessed by these two gentlemen is so great that they have the appearance of being quite different varieties.\"[7]/nThe New Dishley Society has been created to promote the memory of Robert Bakewell and of his contemporaries and students of his methods.[8] The society aims to disseminate knowledge of his work and appreciation of his pioneering legacy in the breeding of improved farm livestock and better crop management. It supports research into the revolutionary agricultural techniques of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and into the men who developed these techniques./nBakewell's pioneering and extremely aggressive use of breeding in-and-in may have contributed to the spread of prionic diseases, such as scrapie, among livestock of the region.[9][10]", "1722874": "\u00d8jvind Winge (May 19, 1886 \u2013 April 5, 1964) was a Danish biologist and a pioneer in yeast genetics.[1][3][4][5][6][7]/nWinge was born in the city of Aarhus in Jutland, the mainland of Denmark. After completing secondary school he travelled to the University of Copenhagen to study law but found himself more suited to the biological sciences into which he transferred. He graduated with a master's degree in the year 1910. From Copenhagen he travelled to Stockholm, Paris and Chicago, studying mainly chromosomal cytology before finally returning to the University of Copenhagen to do a doctoral thesis entitled The Chromosomes: Their Numbers and General Importance. In 1910 Winge was appointed chair of genetics at the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University, Copenhagen, where amongst other works he wrote The Textbook in Genetics, published in 1928./nIn 1933 Winge was offered and accepted the position of Director of the Physiology Department in the Carlsberg Laboratory, Copenhagen. Here he dedicated his research to the 3 principal lifeforms of interest to his benefactors; hops, barley and yeast, although his studies became increasingly dedicated to yeast. He developed and used techniques to achieve the micromanipulation of single yeast cells and spores in order to investigate them on a genetic level. He found that yeast spores are haploid, and diploid cells occur as a result of conjugation of two haploid cells or self-diploidisation. This was important as it revealed that the species exhibits alternation and that strains can be genetically manipulated by specific mating. Winge also demonstrated that the traits of the organisms were mainly governed by simple Mendelian rules. He continued his research and his lab produced a steady output of genetics papers until 1961./nWinge's work was of critical importance to the basic formation of early genetic engineering and biotechnology. He helped to establish a firm basis for what have now developed into important and lucrative scientific fields. For this reason he is often attributed the title of 'The Father of Yeast Genetics'./nIn his 1917 doctoral thesis The Chromosomes: Their Numbers and General Importance, Winge presented his hypothesis of plant hybridization, which has motivated much research.[8]/nPolyploidy has attracted scientific study for almost a century, since de Vries first described the Gigas \u2018mutant\u2019 of Oenothera lamarckiana, which was later shown to be a tetraploid ... Winge ... subsequently observed that different chromosome numbers within genera followed an arithmetic progression of multiplication (within the Asteraceae, for example, some species are 2n \n\n\n\n=\n\n\n{\\displaystyle =}\n\n 18, others 2n \n\n\n\n=\n\n\n{\\displaystyle =}\n\n 36, 54, and so on). This led Winge to propose a hypothesis of hybridisation followed by doubling of the chromosome complement. Successful attempts to create \u2018synthetic\u2019 polyploids confirmed this hypothesis and helped to demonstrate potential mechanisms by which polyploidy could arise naturally ...[9]/nWinge was elected foreign member of the Royal Society in 1947.[1][10]", "45697536": "Adelaide T.

He is best known for researching the Hox family of transcription factors. He is most interested in understanding the role of the Hox genes in the hindbrain and their role in areas of animal development, such as craniofacial development. Krumlauf worked with a variety of renowned scientists in the field of developmental biology throughout his time researching Hox genes.[2]/nRobb was born in Ohio and raised in Ohio and New York. He graduated from Vanderbilt University in 1970 with a degree in chemical engineering. He later went to The Ohio State University and received his PhD in developmental biology in 1979. He has since gone on to be a researcher and professor.[3]/nAfter Krumlauf had completed his formal education, he was hired at Beatson Institute for Cancer Research along with the Fox Chase Cancer Center. In 1985, he moved to London to work at what is now known as the Francis Crick Institute. This institution is one of the most well-known biomedical research centers in the world. At the turn of the millennium, Krumlauf came back to the United States and resided in Missouri. He has since taken on three occupations and has been a professor at the University of Kansas, the University of Kansas School of Medicine, and the University of Missouri at Kansas Dental School. He is now the director of the Stowers Institute for Medical Research.[3]/nKrumlauf researched Hox gene complexes in both mice and Drosophila in 1989. The complexes in both species were compared in order to determine if the gene complexes between these two species may have arisen from a common ancestor. The data shows alignment of these complexes and comparable relative position of genes. This research demonstrates the relationship between Homeobox genes in Drosophila (insects) and mice (metazoans).[4]/nKrumlauf examined Hox-2 gene expression dependence on the differentiation pathway in 1991. The study shows Hox-2 gene expression has a clear reliance on the endoderm pathway the cells follow, which suggests a dependence on Hox-2 expression on the type and degree of differentiation in different cells. This publication also solidified the importance of retinoic acid on Hox-2 expression.[5]/nIn 1996, Krumlauf researched the abnormal migration of motor neurons in mice that lack Hoxb-1.[6] In this study, Krumlauf knew that the vertebrate hindbrain segments into rhombomeres, and that this was responsible for controlling the arrangement of motor neurons in the hindbrain. His research with mutant mouse embryos found that the absence of Hoxb-1 lead to changes in rhombomere 4 (r4) identity. This mutation causes a difference in migration patterns in r4, which demonstrates that Hoxb-1 is plays a role in the regulation of migratory properties of motor neurons present in the hindbrain.[6]/nKrumlauf has manipulated the expression of Hox genes in many ways throughout his career in order to observe variations in development amongst certain animals. For example, in 2013, Krumlauf and his team configured mutant animals with a double-mutant cluster of HoxA-HoxB genes in their neural crest cells. In these mutant animals, they observed a bone that resembled the dentary along with an attachment of neo-muscle. This helped Krumlauf to determine the HoxB genes are able to enhance a phenotype that was directly caused by the deletion of a HoxA cluster. This helped the research group to assess the cooperation between different clusters of Hox genes. Through the use of mutant clusters of HoxA-HoxB genes, Krumlauf and his team were able to visualize how the suppression of one of the Hox genes, with amplification of another type of Hox genes, can be critical in the proper development of an animal. The example shown in this study was the variation in craniofacial development when certain Hox genes are suppressed.[7]/nIn 2014, Krumlauf examined Hox gene expression in comparison to hindbrain segmentation. Gnathostomes were used in this research in an attempt to determine how primitive the relationship between Hox gene expression and segmentation of the hindbrain is. The data concluded that there is clear correlation between Hox expression and hindbrain segmentation. The use of gnathostomes shows this trait to be ancient, with origin at the base of vertebrates.[8]/nKrumlauf is best known for his progression in the field of animal developmental biology and his progression on the current understanding of Hox genes. Hox genes are known for laying out the basic body structures of a wide variety of animals. Hox genes control a variety of regulatory interactions in the hindbrain which leads to segmentation in animals.[5] After many years of research on the importance of Hox genes through manipulation trials, Krumlauf studied the variations of Hox genes between vertebrates and invertebrates in 2017. He notes that Hox gene expression was found in even the most primitive vertebrates, such as the sea lamprey. This Hox gene expression has been maintained across phylogenetically dissimilar vertebrates. However, this is not the case for invertebrates. Krumlauf studied the Hox genes present in chordates and found these invertebrates to lack hindbrain segmentation. He did find that chordates still had conserved some of the aspects of the Hox gene network. This includes things such as the use of retinoic acid in establishing Hox-gene domains.[9]/nKrumlauf\u2019s publications can be used to better understand the role of Hox genes within many species of animals. His research has also helped to express the importance of suppression and regulation of individual Hox genes./n\"Patterning the vertebrate neuraxis\" (1996) This publication examines segmentation and long-range signaling from organizing centers to interpret the role these principles play in the patterning of a vertebrate neuraxis.[10]/n\"Organization of the Fugu rubripes Hox clusters: evidence for continuing evolution of vertebrate Hox complexes\" (1997) This investigation seeks to observe the Hox clusters present in a teleost fish, Fugu rubripes. Four different Hox complexes were discovered within Fugu rubripes. The data shows the Hox clusters in Fugu to be widely variant with respect to length. At least nine genes in the Hox complex has been lost in Fugu when compared to present mammalian complexes. This data demonstrates that gene loss of prototypical Hox clusters is a defining feature in both tetrapod and fish evolution.[11]/n\"'Shocking' developments in chick embryology: electroporation and in ovo gene expression\" (1999) This paper focuses on new approaches to the analysis of gene expression through the use of electroporation.

His proposition that all species of life have descended from a common ancestor is now generally accepted and considered a fundamental concept in science.[9] In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding.[10] Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history and was honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey.[11][12]/nDarwin's early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at the University of Edinburgh; instead, he helped to investigate marine invertebrates. His studies at the University of Cambridge's Christ's College from 1828 to 1831 encouraged his passion for natural science.[13] His five-year voyage on HMS\u00a0Beagle from 1831 to 1836 established Darwin as an eminent geologist, whose observations and theories supported Charles Lyell's concept of gradual geological change. Publication of his journal of the voyage made Darwin famous as a popular author.[14]/nPuzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on the voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations and, in 1838, devised his theory of natural selection.[15] Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority.[16] He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting immediate joint submission of both their theories to the Linnean Society of London.[17] Darwin's work established evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature.[18] In 1871, he examined human evolution and sexual selection in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, followed by The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872). His research on plants was published in a series of books, and in his final book, The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the Actions of Worms (1881), he examined earthworms and their effect on soil./nDarwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species.[19][20] By the 1870s, the scientific community and a majority of the educated public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing explanations that gave only a minor role to natural selection, and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution.[18][21] Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life./nDarwin was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, on 12 February 1809, at his family's home, The Mount.[22][23] He was the fifth of six children of wealthy society doctor and financier Robert Darwin and Susannah Darwin (n\u00e9e Wedgwood). His grandfathers Erasmus Darwin and Josiah Wedgwood were both prominent abolitionists. Erasmus Darwin had praised general concepts of evolution and common descent in his Zoonomia (1794), a poetic fantasy of gradual creation including undeveloped ideas anticipating concepts his grandson expanded.[24]/nBoth families were largely Unitarian, though the Wedgwoods were adopting Anglicanism. Robert Darwin, a freethinker, had baby Charles baptised in November 1809 in the Anglican St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury, but Charles and his siblings attended the local Unitarian Church with their mother. The eight-year-old Charles already had a taste for natural history and collecting when he joined the day school run by its preacher in 1817. That July, his mother died. From September 1818, he joined his older brother Erasmus in attending the nearby Anglican Shrewsbury School as a boarder.[25]/nDarwin spent the summer of 1825 as an apprentice doctor, helping his father treat the poor of Shropshire, before going to the well-regarded University of Edinburgh Medical School with his brother Erasmus in October 1825. Darwin found lectures dull and surgery distressing, so he neglected his studies.[26] He learned taxidermy in around 40 daily hour-long sessions from John Edmonstone, a freed black slave who had accompanied Charles Waterton in the South American rainforest.[27]/nIn Darwin's second year at the university, he joined the Plinian Society, a student natural-history group featuring lively debates in which radical democratic students with materialistic views challenged orthodox religious concepts of science.[28] He assisted Robert Edmond Grant's investigations of the anatomy and life cycle of marine invertebrates in the Firth of Forth, and on 27 March 1827 presented at the Plinian his own discovery that black spores found in oyster shells were the eggs of a skate leech. One day, Grant praised Lamarck's evolutionary ideas. Darwin was astonished by Grant's audacity, but had recently read similar ideas in his grandfather Erasmus' journals.[29] Darwin was rather bored by Robert Jameson's natural-history course, which covered geology\u2014including the debate between Neptunism and Plutonism. He learned the classification of plants, and assisted with work on the collections of the University Museum, one of the largest museums in Europe at the time.[30]/nDarwin's neglect of medical studies annoyed his father, who sent him to Christ's College, Cambridge, in January 1828, to study for a Bachelor of Arts degree as the first step towards becoming an Anglican country parson. Darwin was unqualified for Cambridge's Tripos exams, and was required instead to join the ordinary degree course.[31] He preferred riding and shooting to studying.[32]/nDuring the first few months of Darwin's enrolment at Christ's College, his second cousin William Darwin Fox was still studying there. Fox impressed him with his butterfly collection, introducing Darwin to entomology and influencing him to pursue beetle collecting.[34][35] He did this zealously, and had some of his finds published in James Francis Stephens' Illustrations of British entomology (1829\u201332).[35][36]/nThrough Fox, Darwin became a close friend and follower of botany professor John Stevens Henslow.[34] He met other leading parson-naturalists who saw scientific work as religious natural theology, becoming known to these dons as \"the man who walks with Henslow\". When his own exams drew near, Darwin applied himself to his studies and was delighted by the language and logic of William Paley's Evidences of Christianity (1795).[37] In his final examination in January 1831, Darwin did well, coming tenth out of 178 candidates for the ordinary degree.[38]/nDarwin had to stay at Cambridge until June 1831. He studied Paley's Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity (first published in 1802), which made an argument for divine design in nature, explaining adaptation as God acting through laws of nature.[39] He read John Herschel's new book, Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy (1831), which described the highest aim of natural philosophy as understanding such laws through inductive reasoning based on observation, and Alexander von Humboldt's Personal Narrative of scientific travels in 1799\u20131804. Inspired with \"a burning zeal\" to contribute, Darwin planned to visit Tenerife with some classmates after graduation to study natural history in the tropics. In preparation, he joined Adam Sedgwick's geology course, then on 4 August travelled with him to spend a fortnight mapping strata in Wales.[40][41]/nAfter leaving Sedgwick in Wales, Darwin spent a few days with student friends at Barmouth. He returned home on 29 August to find a letter from Henslow proposing him as a suitable (if unfinished) naturalist for a self-funded supernumerary place on HMS\u00a0Beagle with captain Robert FitzRoy, a position for a gentleman rather than \"a mere collector\". The ship was to leave in four weeks on an expedition to chart the coastline of South America.[42][43] Robert Darwin objected to his son's planned two-year voyage, regarding it as a waste of time, but was persuaded by his brother-in-law, Josiah Wedgwood II, to agree to (and fund) his son's participation.[44] Darwin took care to remain in a private capacity to retain control over his collection, intending it for a major scientific institution.[45]/nAfter delays, the voyage began on 27 December 1831; it lasted almost five years. As FitzRoy had intended, Darwin spent most of that time on land investigating geology and making natural history collections, while HMS Beagle surveyed and charted coasts.[18][46] He kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations, and at intervals during the voyage his specimens were sent to Cambridge together with letters including a copy of his journal for his family.[47] He had some expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting marine invertebrates, but in all other areas, was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal.[48] Despite suffering badly from seasickness, Darwin wrote copious notes while on board the ship. Most of his zoology notes are about marine invertebrates, starting with plankton collected during a calm spell.[46][49]/nOn their first stop ashore at St Jago in Cape Verde, Darwin found that a white band high in the volcanic rock cliffs included seashells. FitzRoy had given him the first volume of Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology, which set out uniformitarian concepts of land slowly rising or falling over immense periods,[II] and Darwin saw things Lyell's way, theorising and thinking of writing a book on geology.[50] When they reached Brazil, Darwin was delighted by the tropical forest,[51] but detested the sight of slavery there, and disputed this issue with Fitzroy.[52]/nThe survey continued to the south in Patagonia. They stopped at Bah\u00eda Blanca, and in cliffs near Punta Alta Darwin made a major find of fossil bones of huge extinct mammals beside modern seashells, indicating recent extinction with no signs of change in climate or catastrophe. He found bony plates like a giant version of the armour on local armadillos. From a jaw and tooth he identified the gigantic Megatherium, then from Cuvier's description thought the armour was from this animal. The finds were shipped to England, and scientists found the fossils of great interest.[53][54] In Patagonia, Darwin came to wrongly believe the territory was devoid of reptiles.[55]/nOn rides with gauchos into the interior to explore geology and collect more fossils, Darwin gained social, political and anthropological insights into both native and colonial people at a time of revolution, and learnt that two types of rhea had separate but overlapping territories.[56][57] Further south, he saw stepped plains of shingle and seashells as raised beaches at a series of elevations. He read Lyell's second volume and accepted its view of \"centres of creation\" of species, but his discoveries and theorising challenged Lyell's ideas of smooth continuity and of extinction of species.[58][59]/nThree Fuegians on board, who had been seized during the first Beagle voyage then given Christian education in England, were returning with a missionary. Darwin found them friendly and civilised, yet at Tierra del Fuego he met \"miserable, degraded savages\", as different as wild from domesticated animals.[60] He remained convinced that, despite this diversity, all humans were interrelated with a shared origin and potential for improvement towards civilisation. Unlike his scientist friends, he now thought there was no unbridgeable gap between humans and animals.[61] A year on, the mission had been abandoned. The Fuegian they had named Jemmy Button lived like the other natives, had a wife, and had no wish to return to England.[62]/nDarwin experienced an earthquake in Chile in 1835 and saw signs that the land had just been raised, including mussel-beds stranded above high tide. High in the Andes he saw seashells, and several fossil trees that had grown on a sand beach. He theorised that as the land rose, oceanic islands sank, and coral reefs round them grew to form atolls.[63][64]/nOn the geologically new Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, Darwin looked for evidence attaching wildlife to an older \"centre of creation\", and found mockingbirds allied to those in Chile but differing from island to island. He heard that slight variations in the shape of tortoise shells showed which island they came from, but failed to collect them, even after eating tortoises taken on board as food.[65][66] In Australia, the marsupial rat-kangaroo and the platypus seemed so unusual that Darwin thought it was almost as though two distinct Creators had been at work.[67] He found the Aborigines \"good-humoured & pleasant\", their numbers depleted by European settlement.[68]/nFitzRoy investigated how the atolls of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands had formed, and the survey supported Darwin's theorising.[64] FitzRoy began writing the official Narrative of the Beagle voyages, and after reading Darwin's diary, he proposed incorporating it into the account.[69] Darwin's Journal was eventually rewritten as a separate third volume, on geology and natural history.[70][71]/nIn Cape Town, South Africa, Darwin and FitzRoy met John Herschel, who had recently written to Lyell praising his uniformitarianism as opening bold speculation on \"that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others\" as \"a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process\".[72]\nWhen organising his notes as the ship sailed home, Darwin wrote that, if his growing suspicions about the mockingbirds, the tortoises and the Falkland Islands fox were correct, \"such facts undermine the stability of Species\", then cautiously added \"would\" before \"undermine\".[73] He later wrote that such facts \"seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species\".[74]/nWithout telling Darwin, extracts from his letters to Henslow had been read to scientific societies, printed as a pamphlet for private distribution among members of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, and reported in magazines,[75] including The Athenaeum.[76] Darwin first heard of this at Cape Town,[77] and at Ascension Island read of Sedgwick's prediction that Darwin \"will have a great name among the Naturalists of Europe\".[78][79]/nOn 2 October 1836, Beagle anchored at Falmouth, Cornwall. Darwin promptly made the long coach journey to Shrewsbury to visit his home and see relatives. He then hurried to Cambridge to see Henslow, who advised him on finding available naturalists to catalogue Darwin's animal collections and to take on the botanical specimens. Darwin's father organised investments, enabling his son to be a self-funded gentleman scientist, and an excited Darwin went around the London institutions being f\u00eated and seeking experts to describe the collections. British zoologists at the time had a huge backlog of work, due to natural history collecting being encouraged throughout the British Empire, and there was a danger of specimens just being left in storage.[80]/nCharles Lyell eagerly met Darwin for the first time on 29 October and soon introduced him to the up-and-coming anatomist Richard Owen, who had the facilities of the Royal College of Surgeons to work on the fossil bones collected by Darwin. Owen's surprising results included other gigantic extinct ground sloths as well as the Megatherium Darwin had identified, a near complete skeleton of the unknown Scelidotherium and a hippopotamus-sized rodent-like skull named Toxodon resembling a giant capybara. The armour fragments were actually from Glyptodon, a huge armadillo-like creature, as Darwin had initially thought.[54][81] These extinct creatures were related to living species in South America.[82]/nIn mid-December, Darwin took lodgings in Cambridge to arrange expert classification of his collections, and prepare his own research for publication. Questions of how to combine his diary into the Narrative were resolved at the end of the month when FitzRoy accepted Broderip's advice to make it a separate volume, and Darwin began work on his Journal and Remarks.[83][84]/nDarwin's first paper showed that the South American landmass was slowly rising, and with Lyell's enthusiastic backing he read it to the Geological Society of London on 4 January 1837. On the same day, he presented his mammal and bird specimens to the Zoological Society. The ornithologist John Gould soon announced that the Galapagos birds that Darwin had thought a mixture of blackbirds, \"gros-beaks\" and finches, were, in fact, twelve separate species of finches. On 17 February, Darwin was elected to the Council of the Geological Society, and Lyell's presidential address presented Owen's findings on Darwin's fossils, stressing geographical continuity of species as supporting his uniformitarian ideas.[85]/nEarly in March, Darwin moved to London to be near this work, joining Lyell's social circle of scientists and experts such as Charles Babbage,[86] who described God as a programmer of laws. Darwin stayed with his freethinking brother Erasmus, part of this Whig circle and a close friend of the writer Harriet Martineau, who promoted the Malthusianism that underpinned the controversial Whig Poor Law reforms to stop welfare from causing overpopulation and more poverty. As a Unitarian, she welcomed the radical implications of transmutation of species, promoted by Grant and younger surgeons influenced by Geoffroy. Transmutation was anathema to Anglicans defending social order,[87] but reputable scientists openly discussed the subject, and there was wide interest in John Herschel's letter praising Lyell's approach as a way to find a natural cause of the origin of new species.[72]/nGould met Darwin and told him that the Gal\u00e1pagos mockingbirds from different islands were separate species, not just varieties, and what Darwin had thought was a \"wren\" was in the finch group. Darwin had not labelled the finches by island, but from the notes of others on the ship, including FitzRoy, he allocated species to islands.[88] The two rheas were distinct species, and on 14 March Darwin announced how their distribution changed going southwards.[89]/nBy mid-March 1837, barely six months after his return to England, Darwin was speculating in his Red Notebook on the possibility that \"one species does change into another\" to explain the geographical distribution of living species such as the rheas, and extinct ones such as the strange extinct mammal Macrauchenia, which resembled a giant guanaco, a llama relative. Around mid-July, he recorded in his \"B\" notebook his thoughts on lifespan and variation across generations\u2014explaining the variations he had observed in Gal\u00e1pagos tortoises, mockingbirds, and rheas. He sketched branching descent, and then a genealogical branching of a single evolutionary tree, in which \"It is absurd to talk of one animal being higher than another\", thereby discarding Lamarck's idea of independent lineages progressing to higher forms.[90]/nWhile developing this intensive study of transmutation, Darwin became mired in more work. Still rewriting his Journal, he took on editing and publishing the expert reports on his collections, and with Henslow's help obtained a Treasury grant of \u00a31,000 to sponsor this multi-volume Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, a sum equivalent to about \u00a3115,000 in 2021.[91] He stretched the funding to include his planned books on geology, and agreed to unrealistic dates with the publisher.[92] As the Victorian era began, Darwin pressed on with writing his Journal, and in August 1837 began correcting printer's proofs.[93]/nAs Darwin worked under pressure, his health suffered. On 20 September, he had \"an uncomfortable palpitation of the heart\", so his doctors urged him to \"knock off all work\" and live in the country for a few weeks. After visiting Shrewsbury, he joined his Wedgwood relatives at Maer Hall, Staffordshire, but found them too eager for tales of his travels to give him much rest. His charming, intelligent, and cultured cousin Emma Wedgwood, nine months older than Darwin, was nursing his invalid aunt. His uncle Josiah pointed out an area of ground where cinders had disappeared under loam and suggested that this might have been the work of earthworms, inspiring \"a new & important theory\" on their role in soil formation, which Darwin presented at the Geological Society on 1 November 1837.[94] His Journal was printed and ready for publication by the end of February 1838, as was the first volume of the Narrative, but FitzRoy was still working hard to finish his own volume.[93]/nWilliam Whewell pushed Darwin to take on the duties of Secretary of the Geological Society. After initially declining the work, he accepted the post in March 1838.[95] Despite the grind of writing and editing the Beagle reports, Darwin made remarkable progress on transmutation, taking every opportunity to question expert naturalists and, unconventionally, people with practical experience in selective breeding such as farmers and pigeon fanciers.[18][96] Over time, his research drew on information from his relatives and children, the family butler, neighbours, colonists and former shipmates.[97] He included mankind in his speculations from the outset, and on seeing an orangutan in the zoo on 28 March 1838 noted its childlike behaviour.[98]/nThe strain took a toll, by June he was being laid up for days on end with stomach problems, headaches and heart symptoms. For the rest of his life, he was repeatedly incapacitated with episodes of stomach pains, vomiting, severe boils, palpitations, trembling and other symptoms, particularly during times of stress, such as attending meetings or making social visits. The cause of Darwin's illness remained unknown, and attempts at treatment had only ephemeral success.[99]/nOn 23 June, he took a break and went \"geologising\" in Scotland. He visited Glen Roy in glorious weather to see the parallel \"roads\" cut into the hillsides at three heights. He later published his view that these were marine raised beaches, but then had to accept that they were shorelines of a proglacial lake.[100]/nFully recuperated, he returned to Shrewsbury in July. Used to jotting down daily notes on animal breeding, he scrawled rambling thoughts about marriage, career and prospects on two scraps of paper, one with columns headed \"Marry\" and \"Not Marry\". Advantages under \"Marry\" included \"constant companion and a friend in old age\u00a0... better than a dog anyhow\", against points such as \"less money for books\" and \"terrible loss of time\".[101] Having decided in favour of marriage, he discussed it with his father, then went to visit his cousin Emma on 29 July. He did not get around to proposing, but against his father's advice, he mentioned his ideas on transmutation.[102]/nContinuing his research in London, Darwin's wide reading now included the sixth edition of Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Population. On 28 September 1838, he noted its assertion that human \"population, when unchecked, goes on doubling itself every twenty-five years, or increases in a geometrical ratio\", a geometric progression so that population soon exceeds food supply in what is known as a Malthusian catastrophe. Darwin was well-prepared to compare this to Augustin de Candolle's \"warring of the species\" of plants and the struggle for existence among wildlife, explaining how numbers of a species kept roughly stable. As species always breed beyond available resources, favourable variations would make organisms better at surviving and passing the variations on to their offspring, while unfavourable variations would be lost. He wrote that the \"final cause of all this wedging, must be to sort out proper structure, & adapt it to changes\", so that \"One may say there is a force like a hundred thousand wedges trying force into every kind of adapted structure into the gaps of in the economy of nature, or rather forming gaps by thrusting out weaker ones.\"[18][103] This would result in the formation of new species.[18][104] As he later wrote in his Autobiography:/nIn October 1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic enquiry, I happened to read for amusement Malthus on Population, and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new species. Here, then, I had at last got a theory by which to work...[105]/nBy mid-December, Darwin saw a similarity between farmers picking the best stock in selective breeding, and a Malthusian Nature selecting from chance variants so that \"every part of newly acquired structure is fully practical and perfected\",[106] thinking this comparison \"a beautiful part of my theory\".[107] He later called his theory natural selection, an analogy with what he termed the \"artificial selection\" of selective breeding.[18]/nOn 11 November, he returned to Maer and proposed to Emma, once more telling her his ideas. She accepted, then in exchanges of loving letters she showed how she valued his openness in sharing their differences, while expressing her strong Unitarian beliefs and concerns that his honest doubts might separate them in the afterlife.[108] While he was house-hunting in London, bouts of illness continued and Emma wrote urging him to get some rest, almost prophetically remarking \"So don't be ill any more my dear Charley till I can be with you to nurse you.\" He found what they called \"Macaw Cottage\" (because of its gaudy interiors) in Gower Street, then moved his \"museum\" in over Christmas. On 24 January 1839, Darwin was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS).[1][109]/nOn 29 January, Darwin and Emma Wedgwood were married at Maer in an Anglican ceremony arranged to suit the Unitarians, then immediately caught the train to London and their new home.[110]/nDarwin now had the framework of his theory of natural selection \"by which to work\",[105] as his \"prime hobby\".[111] His research included extensive experimental selective breeding of plants and animals, finding evidence that species were not fixed and investigating many detailed ideas to refine and substantiate his theory.[18] For fifteen years this work was in the background to his main occupation of writing on geology and publishing expert reports on the Beagle collections, in particular, the barnacles.[112]/nFitzRoy's long delayed Narrative was published in May 1839. Darwin's Journal and Remarks got good reviews as the third volume, and on 15 August it was published on its own. Early in 1842, Darwin wrote about his ideas to Charles Lyell, who noted that his ally \"denies seeing a beginning to each crop of species\".[71][113]/nDarwin's book The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs on his theory of atoll formation was published in May 1842 after more than three years of work, and he then wrote his first \"pencil sketch\" of his theory of natural selection.[114] To escape the pressures of London, the family moved to rural Down House in Kent in September.[115] On 11 January 1844, Darwin mentioned his theorising to the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, writing with melodramatic humour \"it is like confessing a murder\".[116][117] Hooker replied, \"There may, in my opinion, have been a series of productions on different spots, & also a gradual change of species. I shall be delighted to hear how you think that this change may have taken place, as no presently conceived opinions satisfy me on the subject.\"[118]/nBy July, Darwin had expanded his \"sketch\" into a 230-page \"Essay\", to be expanded with his research results if he died prematurely.[120] In November, the anonymously published sensational best-seller Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation brought wide interest in transmutation. Darwin scorned its amateurish geology and zoology, but carefully reviewed his own arguments. Controversy erupted, and it continued to sell well despite contemptuous dismissal by scientists.[121][122]/nDarwin completed his third geological book in 1846. He now renewed a fascination and expertise in marine invertebrates, dating back to his student days with Grant, by dissecting and classifying the barnacles he had collected on the voyage, enjoying observing beautiful structures and thinking about comparisons with allied structures.[123] In 1847, Hooker read the \"Essay\" and sent notes that provided Darwin with the calm critical feedback that he needed, but would not commit himself and questioned Darwin's opposition to continuing acts of creation.[124]/nIn an attempt to improve his chronic ill health, Darwin went in 1849 to Dr James Gully's Malvern spa and was surprised to find some benefit from hydrotherapy.[125] Then, in 1851, his treasured daughter Annie fell ill, reawakening his fears that his illness might be hereditary. She died the same year after a long series of crises.[126]/nIn eight years of work on barnacles, Darwin's theory helped him to find \"homologies\" showing that slightly changed body parts served different functions to meet new conditions, and in some genera he found minute males parasitic on hermaphrodites, showing an intermediate stage in evolution of distinct sexes.[127] In 1853, it earned him the Royal Society's Royal Medal, and it made his reputation as a biologist.[128] In 1854, he became a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London, gaining postal access to its library.[129] He began a major reassessment of his theory of species, and in November realised that divergence in the character of descendants could be explained by them becoming adapted to \"diversified places in the economy of nature\".[130]/nBy the start of 1856, Darwin was investigating whether eggs and seeds could survive travel across seawater to spread species across oceans. Hooker increasingly doubted the traditional view that species were fixed, but their young friend Thomas Henry Huxley was still firmly against the transmutation of species. Lyell was intrigued by Darwin's speculations without realising their extent. When he read a paper by Alfred Russel Wallace, \"On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species\", he saw similarities with Darwin's thoughts and urged him to publish to establish precedence.[132]/nThough Darwin saw no threat, on 14 May 1856 he began writing a short paper. Finding answers to difficult questions held him up repeatedly, and he expanded his plans to a \"big book on species\" titled Natural Selection, which was to include his \"note on Man\". He continued his research, obtaining information and specimens from naturalists worldwide, including Wallace who was working in Borneo.[132]/nIn mid-1857, he added a section heading; \"Theory applied to Races of Man\", but did not add text on this topic. On 5 September 1857, Darwin sent the American botanist Asa Gray a detailed outline of his ideas, including an abstract of Natural Selection, which omitted human origins and sexual selection. In December, Darwin received a letter from Wallace asking if the book would examine human origins. He responded that he would avoid that subject, \"so surrounded with prejudices\", while encouraging Wallace's theorising and adding that \"I go much further than you.\"[132]/nDarwin's book was only partly written when, on 18 June 1858, he received a paper from Wallace describing natural selection. Shocked that he had been \"forestalled\", Darwin sent it on that day to Lyell, as requested by Wallace,[133][134] and although Wallace had not asked for publication, Darwin suggested he would send it to any journal that Wallace chose. His family was in crisis, with children in the village dying of scarlet fever, and he put matters in the hands of his friends. After some discussion, with no reliable way of involving Wallace, Lyell and Hooker decided on a joint presentation at the Linnean Society on 1 July of On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection. On the evening of 28 June, Darwin's baby son died of scarlet fever after almost a week of severe illness, and he was too distraught to attend.[135]/nThere was little immediate attention to this announcement of the theory; the president of the Linnean Society remarked in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any revolutionary discoveries.[136] Only one review rankled enough for Darwin to recall it later; Professor Samuel Haughton of Dublin claimed that \"all that was new in them was false, and what was true was old\".[137] Darwin struggled for thirteen months to produce an abstract of his \"big book\", suffering from ill health but getting constant encouragement from his scientific friends. Lyell arranged to have it published by John Murray.[138]/nOn the Origin of Species proved unexpectedly popular, with the entire stock of 1,250 copies oversubscribed when it went on sale to booksellers on 22 November 1859.[139] In the book, Darwin set out \"one long argument\" of detailed observations, inferences and consideration of anticipated objections.[140] In making the case for common descent, he included evidence of homologies between humans and other mammals.[141][III] Having outlined sexual selection, he hinted that it could explain differences between human races.[142][IV] He avoided explicit discussion of human origins, but implied the significance of his work with the sentence; \"Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.\"[143][IV] His theory is simply stated in the introduction:/nAs many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.[144]/nAt the end of the book he concluded that:/nThere is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.[145]/nThe last word was the only variant of \"evolved\" in the first five editions of the book. \"Evolutionism\" at that time was associated with other concepts, most commonly with embryological development. Darwin first used the word evolution in The Descent of Man in 1871, before adding it in 1872 to the 6th edition of The Origin of Species.[146]/nThe book aroused international interest, with less controversy than had greeted the popular and less scientific Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation.[148] Though Darwin's illness kept him away from the public debates, he eagerly scrutinised the scientific response, commenting on press cuttings, reviews, articles, satires and caricatures, and corresponded on it with colleagues worldwide.[149] The book did not explicitly discuss human origins,[143][IV] but included a number of hints about the animal ancestry of humans from which the inference could be made.[150]/nThe first review asked, \"If a monkey has become a man \u2013 what may not a man become?\" It said this should be left to theologians as being too dangerous for ordinary readers.[151] Amongst early favourable responses, Huxley's reviews swiped at Richard Owen, leader of the scientific establishment which Huxley was trying to overthrow.[152]/nIn April, Owen's review attacked Darwin's friends and condescendingly dismissed his ideas, angering Darwin,[153] but Owen and others began to promote ideas of supernaturally guided evolution. Patrick Matthew drew attention to his 1831 book which had a brief appendix suggesting a concept of natural selection leading to new species, but he had not developed the idea.[154]/nThe Church of England's response was mixed. Darwin's old Cambridge tutors Sedgwick and Henslow dismissed the ideas, but liberal clergymen interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God's design, with the cleric Charles Kingsley seeing it as \"just as noble a conception of Deity\".[155] In 1860, the publication of Essays and Reviews by seven liberal Anglican theologians diverted clerical attention from Darwin. Its ideas, including higher criticism, were attacked by church authorities as heresy. In it, Baden Powell argued that miracles broke God's laws, so belief in them was atheistic, and praised \"Mr Darwin's masterly volume [supporting] the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature\".[156]/nAsa Gray discussed teleology with Darwin, who imported and distributed Gray's pamphlet on theistic evolution, Natural Selection is not inconsistent with natural theology.[155][157] The most famous confrontation was at the public 1860 Oxford evolution debate during a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, where the Bishop of Oxford Samuel Wilberforce, though not opposed to transmutation of species, argued against Darwin's explanation and human descent from apes. Joseph Hooker argued strongly for Darwin, and Thomas Huxley's legendary retort, that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his gifts, came to symbolise a triumph of science over religion.[155][158]/nEven Darwin's close friends Gray, Hooker, Huxley and Lyell still expressed various reservations but gave strong support, as did many others, particularly younger naturalists. Gray and Lyell sought reconciliation with faith, while Huxley portrayed a polarisation between religion and science. He campaigned pugnaciously against the authority of the clergy in education,[155] aiming to overturn the dominance of clergymen and aristocratic amateurs under Owen in favour of a new generation of professional scientists. Owen's claim that brain anatomy proved humans to be a separate biological order from apes was shown to be false by Huxley in a long running dispute parodied by Kingsley as the \"Great Hippocampus Question\", and discredited Owen.[159]\nIn response to objections that the origin of life was unexplained, Darwin pointed to acceptance of Newton's law even though the cause of gravity was unknown.[160] Despite criticisms and reservations related to this topic, he nevertheless proposed a prescient idea in an 1871 letter to Hooker in which he suggested the origin of life may have occurred in a \"warm little pond\".[161]/nDarwinism became a movement covering a wide range of evolutionary ideas. In 1863, Lyell's Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man popularised prehistory, though his caution on evolution disappointed Darwin. Weeks later Huxley's Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature showed that anatomically, humans are apes, then The Naturalist on the River Amazons by Henry Walter Bates provided empirical evidence of natural selection.[162] Lobbying brought Darwin Britain's highest scientific honour, the Royal Society's Copley Medal, awarded on 3 November 1864.[163] That day, Huxley held the first meeting of what became the influential \"X Club\" devoted to \"science, pure and free, untrammelled by religious dogmas\".[164] By the end of the decade, most scientists agreed that evolution occurred, but only a minority supported Darwin's view that the chief mechanism was natural selection.[165]/nThe Origin of Species was translated into many languages, becoming a staple scientific text attracting thoughtful attention from all walks of life, including the \"working men\" who flocked to Huxley's lectures.[166] Darwin's theory resonated with various movements at the time[V] and became a key fixture of popular culture.[VI] Cartoonists parodied animal ancestry in an old tradition of showing humans with animal traits, and in Britain, these droll images served to popularise Darwin's theory in an unthreatening way. While ill in 1862, Darwin began growing a beard, and when he reappeared in public in 1866, caricatures of him as an ape helped to identify all forms of evolutionism with Darwinism.[147]/nDespite repeated bouts of illness during the last twenty-two years of his life,[167] Darwin's work continued. Having published On the Origin of Species as an abstract of his theory, he pressed on with experiments, research, and writing of his \"big book\". He covered human descent from earlier animals, including the evolution of society and of mental abilities, as well as explaining decorative beauty in wildlife and diversifying into innovative plant studies.[168]/nEnquiries about insect pollination led in 1861 to novel studies of wild orchids, showing adaptation of their flowers to attract specific moths to each species and ensure cross fertilisation. In 1862 Fertilisation of Orchids gave his first detailed demonstration of the power of natural selection to explain complex ecological relationships, making testable predictions. As his health declined, he lay on his sickbed in a room filled with inventive experiments to trace the movements of climbing plants.[169] Admiring visitors included Ernst Haeckel, a zealous proponent of Darwinism incorporating Lamarckism and Goethe's idealism.[170] Wallace remained supportive, though he increasingly turned to Spiritualism.[171]/nDarwin's book The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication (1868) was the first part of his planned \"big book\", and included his unsuccessful hypothesis of pangenesis attempting to explain heredity. It sold briskly at first, despite its size, and was translated into many languages. He wrote most of a second part, on natural selection, but it remained unpublished in his lifetime.[172]/nLyell had already popularised human prehistory, and Huxley had shown that anatomically humans are apes.[162] With The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex published in 1871, Darwin set out evidence from numerous sources that humans are animals, showing continuity of physical and mental attributes, and presented sexual selection to explain impractical animal features such as the peacock's plumage as well as human evolution of culture, differences between sexes, and physical and cultural racial classification, while emphasizing that humans are all one species.[173] According to an editorial in Nature journal: \"Although Charles Darwin opposed slavery and proposed that humans have a common ancestor, he also advocated a hierarchy of races, with white people higher than others.\"[174]/nHis research using images was expanded in his 1872 book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, one of the first books to feature printed photographs, which discussed the evolution of human psychology and its continuity with the behaviour of animals. Both books proved very popular, and Darwin was impressed by the general assent with which his views had been received, remarking that \"everybody is talking about it without being shocked.\"[175] His conclusion was \"that man with all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to the humblest living creature, with his god-like intellect which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar system\u2014with all these exalted powers\u2014Man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.\"[176]/nHis evolution-related experiments and investigations led to books on Insectivorous Plants, The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom, different forms of flowers on plants of the same species, and The Power of Movement in Plants. He continued to collect information and exchange views from scientific correspondents all over the world, including Mary Treat, whom he encouraged to persevere in her scientific work.[177] He was the first person to recognize the significance of carnivory in plants.[178] His botanical work[IX] was interpreted and popularised by various writers including Grant Allen and H. G. Wells, and helped transform plant science in the late 19th century and early 20th century.[179][180]/nIn 1882, he was diagnosed with what was called \"angina pectoris\" which then meant coronary thrombosis and disease of the heart. At the time of his death, the physicians diagnosed \"anginal attacks\", and \"heart-failure\"; there has since been scholarly speculation about his life-long health issues.[181][182]/nHe died at Down House on 19 April 1882. His last words were to his family, telling Emma, \"I am not the least afraid of death\u2014Remember what a good wife you have been to me\u2014Tell all my children to remember how good they have been to me\". While she rested, he repeatedly told Henrietta and Francis, \"It's almost worthwhile to be sick to be nursed by you\".[183]/nHe had expected to be buried in St Mary's churchyard at Downe, but at the request of Darwin's colleagues, after public and parliamentary petitioning, William Spottiswoode (President of the Royal Society) arranged for Darwin to be honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey, close to John Herschel and Isaac Newton. The funeral, held on Wednesday 26 April, was attended by thousands of people, including family, friends, scientists, philosophers and dignitaries.[184][12]/n/nAs Alfred Russel Wallace put it, Darwin had \"wrought a greater revolution in human thought within a quarter of a century than any man of our time \u2013 or perhaps any time\", having \"given us a new conception of the world of life, and a theory which is itself a powerful instrument of research; has shown us how to combine into one consistent whole the facts accumulated by all the separate classes of workers, and has thereby revolutionised the whole study of nature\".[185]/nMost scientists were now convinced of evolution as descent with modification, though few agreed with Darwin that natural selection \"has been the main but not the exclusive means of modification\".[186] During \"the eclipse of Darwinism\" scientists explored alternative mechanisms. Then Ronald Fisher incorporated Mendelian genetics in The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection,[187] leading to population genetics and the modern evolutionary synthesis, which continues to develop.[21] Scientific discoveries have confirmed and validated Darwin's key insights.[185]/nGeographical features given his name include Darwin Sound[188] and Mount Darwin,[189] both named while he was on the Beagle voyage, and Darwin Harbour, named by his former shipmates on its next voyage, which eventually became the location of Darwin, the capital city of Australia's Northern Territory.[190] Darwin's name was given, formally or informally, to numerous plants and animals, including many he had collected on the voyage.[191][192] The Linnean Society of London began awards of the Darwin\u2013Wallace Medal in 1908, to mark fifty years from the joint reading on 1 July 1858 of papers by Darwin and Wallace publishing their theory. Further awards were made in 1958 and 2008, since 2010 the medal awards have been annual.[193] Darwin College, a postgraduate college at Cambridge University founded in 1964, is named after the Darwin family.[194] From 2000 to 2017, UK \u00a310 banknotes issued by the Bank of England featured Darwin's portrait printed on the reverse,[195][196] along with a hummingbird and HMS Beagle.[197]/nThe Darwins had ten children: two died in infancy, and Annie's death at the age of ten had a devastating effect on her parents. Charles was a devoted father and uncommonly attentive to his children.[13] Whenever they fell ill, he feared that they might have inherited weaknesses from inbreeding due to the close family ties he shared with his wife and cousin, Emma Wedgwood. He examined inbreeding in his writings, contrasting it with the advantages of outcrossing in many species.[198]/nCharles Waring Darwin, born in December 1856, was the tenth and last of the children. Emma Darwin was aged 48 at the time of the birth, and the child was mentally subnormal and never learnt to walk or talk. He probably had Down syndrome, which had not then been medically described. The evidence is a photograph by William Erasmus Darwin of the infant and his mother, showing a characteristic head shape, and the family's observations of the child.[199] Charles Waring died of scarlet fever on 28 June 1858,[200] when Darwin wrote in his journal, \"Poor dear Baby died.\"[201]/nOf his surviving children, George, Francis and Horace became Fellows of the Royal Society,[202] distinguished as an astronomer,[203] botanist and civil engineer, respectively. All three were knighted.[204] Another son, Leonard, went on to be a soldier, politician, economist, eugenicist, and mentor of the statistician and evolutionary biologist Ronald Fisher.[205]/nDarwin's family tradition was nonconformist Unitarianism, while his father and grandfather were freethinkers, and his baptism and boarding school were Church of England.[25] When going to Cambridge to become an Anglican clergyman, he did not \"in the least doubt the strict and literal truth of every word in the Bible\".[37] He learned John Herschel's science which, like William Paley's natural theology, sought explanations in laws of nature rather than miracles and saw adaptation of species as evidence of design.[39][40] On board HMS Beagle, Darwin was quite orthodox and would quote the Bible as an authority on morality.[206] He looked for \"centres of creation\" to explain distribution,[65] and suggested that the very similar antlions found in Australia and England were evidence of a divine hand.[67]/nUpon his return, he expressed a critical view of the Bible's historical accuracy and questioned the basis for considering one religion more valid than another.[206] In the next few years, while intensively speculating on geology and the transmutation of species, he gave much thought to religion and openly discussed this with his wife Emma, whose beliefs similarly came from intensive study and questioning.[108]/nThe theodicy of Paley and Thomas Malthus vindicated evils such as starvation as a result of a benevolent creator's laws, which had an overall good effect. To Darwin, natural selection produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design,[208] and he could not see the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering, such as the ichneumon wasp paralysing caterpillars as live food for its eggs.[157] Though he thought of religion as a tribal survival strategy, Darwin was reluctant to give up the idea of God as an ultimate lawgiver. He was increasingly troubled by the problem of evil.[209][210]/nDarwin remained close friends with the vicar of Downe, John Brodie Innes, and continued to play a leading part in the parish work of the church,[211] but from c.\u20091849 would go for a walk on Sundays while his family attended church.[207] He considered it \"absurd to doubt that a man might be an ardent theist and an evolutionist\"[212][213] and, though reticent about his religious views, in 1879 he wrote that \"I have never been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a God.\u00a0\u2013 I think that generally ... an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind\".[108][212]/nThe \"Lady Hope Story\", published in 1915, claimed that Darwin had reverted to Christianity on his sickbed. The claims were repudiated by Darwin's children and have been dismissed as false by historians.[214]/nDarwin's views on social and political issues reflected his time and social position. He grew up in a family of Whig reformers who, like his uncle Josiah Wedgwood, supported electoral reform and the emancipation of slaves. Darwin was passionately opposed to slavery, while seeing no problem with the working conditions of English factory workers or servants.[215]/nTaking taxidermy lessons in 1826 from the freed slave John Edmonstone, whom Darwin long recalled as \"a very pleasant and intelligent man\", reinforced his belief that black people shared the same feelings, and could be as intelligent as people of other races. He took the same attitude to native people he met on the Beagle voyage.[216] Though commonplace in Britain at the time, Silliman and Bachman noticed the contrast with slave-owning America. Around twenty years later, racism became a feature of British society,[27][217] but Darwin remained strongly against slavery, against \"ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species\", and against ill-treatment of native people.[218][VII]/nDarwin's interaction with Yaghans (Fuegians) such as Jemmy Button during the second voyage of HMS Beagle had a profound impact on his view of indigenous peoples. At his arrival in Tierra del Fuego he made a colourful description of \"Fuegian savages\".[219] This view changed as he came to know Yaghan people more in detail. By studying the Yaghans, Darwin concluded that a number of basic emotions by different human groups were the same and that mental capabilities were roughly the same as for Europeans.[219] While interested in Yaghan culture, Darwin failed to appreciate their deep ecological knowledge and elaborate cosmology until the 1850s when he inspected a dictionary of Yaghan detailing 32,000 words.[219] He saw that European colonisation would often lead to the extinction of native civilisations, and \"tr[ied] to integrate colonialism into an evolutionary history of civilization analogous to natural history\".[220]/nDarwin's view of women was that men's eminence over them was the outcome of sexual selection, a view disputed by Antoinette Brown Blackwell in her 1875 book The Sexes Throughout Nature.[221]/nDarwin was intrigued by his half-cousin Francis Galton's argument, introduced in 1865, that statistical analysis of heredity showed that moral and mental human traits could be inherited, and principles of animal breeding could apply to humans. In The Descent of Man, Darwin noted that aiding the weak to survive and have families could lose the benefits of natural selection, but cautioned that withholding such aid would endanger the instinct of sympathy, \"the noblest part of our nature\", and factors such as education could be more important. When Galton suggested that publishing research could encourage intermarriage within a \"caste\" of \"those who are naturally gifted\", Darwin foresaw practical difficulties, and thought it \"the sole feasible, yet I fear utopian, plan of procedure in improving the human race\", preferring to simply publicise the importance of inheritance and leave decisions to individuals.[222] Francis Galton named this field of study \"eugenics\" in 1883,[VIII] after Darwin's death, and his theories were cited to promote eugenic policies.[220]/nDarwin's fame and popularity led to his name being associated with ideas and movements that, at times, had only an indirect relation to his writings, and sometimes went directly against his express comments./nThomas Malthus had argued that population growth beyond resources was ordained by God to get humans to work productively and show restraint in getting families; this was used in the 1830s to justify workhouses and laissez-faire economics.[223] Evolution was by then seen as having social implications, and Herbert Spencer's 1851 book Social Statics based ideas of human freedom and individual liberties on his Lamarckian evolutionary theory.[224]/nSoon after the Origin was published in 1859, critics derided his description of a struggle for existence as a Malthusian justification for the English industrial capitalism of the time. The term Darwinism was used for the evolutionary ideas of others, including Spencer's \"survival of the fittest\" as free-market progress, and Ernst Haeckel's polygenistic ideas of human development. Writers used natural selection to argue for various, often contradictory, ideologies such as laissez-faire dog-eat-dog capitalism, colonialism and imperialism. However, Darwin's holistic view of nature included \"dependence of one being on another\"; thus pacifists, socialists, liberal social reformers and anarchists such as Peter Kropotkin stressed the value of co-operation over struggle within a species.[225] Darwin himself insisted that social policy should not simply be guided by concepts of struggle and selection in nature.[226]/nAfter the 1880s, a eugenics movement developed on ideas of biological inheritance, and for scientific justification of their ideas appealed to some concepts of Darwinism. In Britain, most shared Darwin's cautious views on voluntary improvement and sought to encourage those with good traits in \"positive eugenics\". During the \"Eclipse of Darwinism\", a scientific foundation for eugenics was provided by Mendelian genetics. Negative eugenics to remove the \"feebleminded\" were popular in America, Canada and Australia, and eugenics in the United States introduced compulsory sterilisation laws, followed by several other countries. Subsequently, Nazi eugenics brought the field into disrepute.[VIII]/nThe term \"Social Darwinism\" was used infrequently from around the 1890s, but became popular as a derogatory term in the 1940s when used by Richard Hofstadter to attack the laissez-faire conservatism of those like William Graham Sumner who opposed reform and socialism. Since then, it has been used as a term of abuse by those opposed to what they think are the moral consequences of evolution.[227][223]/nDarwin was a prolific writer. Even without the publication of his works on evolution, he would have had a considerable reputation as the author of The Voyage of the Beagle, as a geologist who had published extensively on South America and had solved the puzzle of the formation of coral atolls, and as a biologist who had published the definitive work on barnacles. While On the Origin of Species dominates perceptions of his work, The Descent of Man and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals had considerable impact, and his books on plants including The Power of Movement in Plants were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms.[228][229]/nI. ^ Robert FitzRoy was to become known after the voyage for biblical literalism, but at this time he had considerable interest in Lyell's ideas, and they met before the voyage when Lyell asked for observations to be made in South America. FitzRoy's diary during the ascent of the River Santa Cruz in Patagonia recorded his opinion that the plains were raised beaches, but on return, newly married to a very religious lady, he recanted these ideas.(Browne 1995, pp.\u00a0186, 414)/nII. ^  In the section \"Morphology\" of Chapter XIII of On the Origin of Species, Darwin commented on homologous bone patterns between humans and other mammals, writing: \"What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative positions?\"[231] and in the concluding chapter: \"The framework of bones being the same in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, fin of the porpoise, and leg of the horse \u2026 at once explain themselves on the theory of descent with slow and slight successive modifications.\"[232]/nIII. 1 2 3 \nIn On the Origin of Species Darwin mentioned human origins in his concluding remark that \"In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.\"[143]/nIn \"Chapter VI: Difficulties on Theory\" he referred to sexual selection: \"I might have adduced for this same purpose the differences between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous.\"[142]/nIn The Descent of Man of 1871, Darwin discussed the first passage:\n\"During many years I collected notes on the origin or descent of man, without any intention of publishing on the subject, but rather with the determination not to publish, as I thought that I should thus only add to the prejudices against my views. It seemed to me sufficient to indicate, in the first edition of my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work 'light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history;' and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth.\"[233] In a preface to the 1874 second edition, he added a reference to the second point: \"it has been said by several critics, that when I found that many details of structure in man could not be explained through natural selection, I invented sexual selection; I gave, however, a tolerably clear sketch of this principle in the first edition of the 'Origin of Species,' and I there stated that it was applicable to man.\"[234]/nIV. ^  See, for example, WILLA volume 4, Charlotte Perkins Gilman and the Feminization of Education by Deborah M. De Simone: \"Gilman shared many basic educational ideas with the generation of thinkers who matured during the period of \"intellectual chaos\" caused by Darwin's Origin of the Species. Marked by the belief that individuals can direct human and social evolution, many progressives came to view education as the panacea for advancing social progress and for solving such problems as urbanisation, poverty, or immigration.\"/nV. ^  See, for example, the song \"A lady fair of lineage high\" from Gilbert and Sullivan's Princess Ida, which describes the descent of man (but not woman!) from apes./nVI. ^  Darwin's belief that black people had the same essential humanity as Europeans, and had many mental similarities, was reinforced by the lessons he had from John Edmonstone in 1826.[27] Early in the Beagle voyage, Darwin nearly lost his position on the ship when he criticised FitzRoy's defence and praise of slavery. (Darwin 1958, p.\u00a074) He wrote home about \"how steadily the general feeling, as shown at elections, has been rising against Slavery. What a proud thing for England if she is the first European nation which utterly abolishes it! I was told before leaving England that after living in slave countries all my opinions would be altered; the only alteration I am aware of is forming a much higher estimate of the negro character.\" (Darwin 1887, p.\u00a0246) Regarding Fuegians, he \"could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilized man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement\", but he knew and liked civilised Fuegians like Jemmy Button: \"It seems yet wonderful to me, when I think over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here.\" (Darwin 1845, pp.\u00a0205, 207\u2013208)/nIn the Descent of Man, he mentioned the similarity of Fuegians' and Edmonstone's minds to Europeans' when arguing against \"ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species\".[235]/nHe rejected the ill-treatment of native people, and for example wrote of massacres of Patagonian men, women, and children, \"Every one here is fully convinced that this is the most just war, because it is against barbarians. Who would believe in this age that such atrocities could be committed in a Christian civilized country?\"(Darwin 1845, p.\u00a0102)/nVII. 1 2 Geneticists studied human heredity as Mendelian inheritance, while eugenics movements sought to manage society, with a focus on social class in the United Kingdom, and on disability and ethnicity in the United States, leading to geneticists seeing this movement as impractical pseudoscience. A shift from voluntary arrangements to \"negative\" eugenics included compulsory sterilisation laws in the United States, copied by Nazi Germany as the basis for Nazi eugenics based on virulent racism and \"racial hygiene\".(Thurtle, Phillip (17 December 1996). \"the creation of genetic identity\".

Oriented tube structures are present in many serpulid species and cannot be explained by the standard carbonate slurry model. Vinn and his co-authors have hypothesized that oriented structures in serpulid tubes have been secreted in the same way as in mollusc shells, based on their ultrastructural similarity. Vinn and his co-authors proposed alternative ways to explain the calcified secretory granules described by Neff [4] in the lumen of the calcium-secreting glands in serpulids. They proposed that worm actually produces calcium-saturated mucus in the glands. The mucus is then deposited on the tube aperture, where crystallization of the structure is controlled by an organic matrix, as in molluscs. The calcified granules in the glands may only be an artifact of fixation and formed after the death of the worm.[5]/nVinn has studied evolution of symbiosis in several groups of early invertebrates such as cornulitids, microconchids, bryozoans, brachiopods, crinoids, stromatoporoids, tabulates and rugosans.

Due to personal concerns and the lack of opportunity for beginning graduate students to participate in laboratory work, he left the program without completing the degree.[1] Some months later, he enrolled as a graduate student in biophysics at the University of Colorado Medical Center.

Originally, it was believed that, in the bacterial RNase P complex, the protein subunit was responsible for the catalytic activity of the complex, which is involved in the maturation of tRNAs. During experiments in which the complex was reconstituted in test tubes, Altman and his group discovered that the RNA component, in isolation, was sufficient for the observed catalytic activity of the enzyme, indicating that the RNA itself had catalytic properties, which was the discovery that earned him the Nobel Prize.[7] Although the RNase P complex also exists in eukaryotic organisms, his later work revealed that in those organisms, the protein subunits of the complex are essential to the catalytic activity, in contrast to the bacterial RNase P./nAltman was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1988[8] and a member of both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society in 1990.[9][10]/nAltman died on April 5, 2022, in Rockleigh, New Jersey, after a long illness.[11][12]", "69618243": "Hubert Jakob Ludwig (22 March 1852 \u2013 17 November 1913) was a German zoologist and marine biologist best known for his studies of echinoderms.

In 1987 Sermonti was one of the founding members of the Osaka \"Group for the Study of Dynamic Structure\" which holds the view of process structuralism./nAn acknowledged critic of Neo-Darwinian theory,[6] Sermonti's view was that evolution encompasses more than Neo-Darwinism.

Moreover, considering his multiple documented statements denying that he was not a creationist, coupled with the content of his published works this certainly seems a substantial misreading.   Like many academic critics of Neo-Darwinism parts of his work have been cherry picked by Creationists. In 1993 Sermonti published in Answers in Genesis's young earth creation magazine, an article entitled \"Not from the apes\", a paper that was a philosophical style critique of aspects of scientific and evolutionary theory in the sense of Gould and Lewontin's critique of 'unverifiable narrative explanations', or 'Just so Stories'. The young earth creationist Henry M.

However, his work showed that mutations in the neurotransmitter-degrading enzyme acetylcholinesterase cause abnormal swimming behavior in one line of mutant zebrafish.[6] In collaboration with John Kuwada's laboratory at the University of Michigan, they also discovered mutations in a zebrafish glycine receptor underlie abnormal swimming in another line of zebrafish[7]/nAt the University of Massachusetts, Downes continued his work on zebrafish mutants that exhibit abnormal swimming behavior.

Together with his brother Hallvard Devold, Finn shared an interest in the Arctic areas and in the expansion of Norwegian sovereignty across Greenland.[1][2]/nFinn first traveled to the Arctic in 1923, interrupting his earlier scientific studies in Norway. Together with his brother Hallvard he worked at the Kvadehuken meteorology station in Svalbard which had been established in 1920 by the Geophysical Institute of Troms\u00f8. While there he took part in a rescue operation of two English airmen whose aircraft had crash-landed nearby. In October 1924 the Kvadehuken facility was closed up for financial reasons and less than two years later he and his brother moved to the meteorological station in Jan Mayen. In 1927 Finn measured the elevation of Beerenberg, a volcano that is the island's highest point.[3] After leaving Jan Mayen in 1928 Finn traveled to northeastern Greenland with his brother, who was a leader of the \"Greenland case\" (Gr\u00f8nlandssaken), a movement that sought to bring large swathes of East Greenland under Norwegian sovereignty.

He went to school in Bayreuth from 1864 to 1873. From 1873 to 1875 he studied natural sciences in the University of Erlangen, where he also worked as an assistant to the Zoologist Emil Selenka in the summer of 1875. From 1875 to 1876 he took two semesters at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.[4][5]/nAfter graduating, D\u00f6derlein moved to the University of Stra\u00dfburg.

From 1876 to 1878 he worked for four semesters in the zoology department of the University of Stra\u00dfburg as an assistant to the German zoologist and phycologist Eduard Oscar Schmidt./nThe prospects for an academic career were poor, so for a time, he worked as a schoolteacher in the Alsatian town of Mulhouse. There he met and befriended the Japanese student Kenji Oosawa (1852\u20131927), who was studying medicine and physiology at the University of Strasbourg. Oosawa arranged for D\u00f6derlein to be invited to Japan to work as a Professor of Natural History in the Faculty of Medicine of the newly established University of Tokyo. D\u00f6derlein accepted gratefully.[2]/nD\u00f6derlein was one of the first European academics invited to Japan during the Meiji Restoration era, when Japan was undergoing rapid modernization after the end of the isolation period (Sakoku).[6] He stayed from 1879 to 1881 as an oyatoi gaikokujin (\"foreign employee\") professor. During this time, he collected and preserved marine life extensively, particularly fish, sponges, crustaceans, crinoids, sea urchins, cnidarians, and bryozoans. In addition, he also occasionally collected specimens of amphibians (including a giant salamander), mammals, birds, and plants.[3][6] At first, he obtained most of his specimens from the fish markets and gift shops of Tokyo and the island of Enoshima.[2] Later, he himself fished for specimens directly from Sagami Bay.[6]/n[I] bought a great number of things: ...

There is hardly anyone who doesn't leave that lovely island [of Enoshima] without having bought a souvenir from the stalls to take it home. The zoologist can use those shops to gain best profit from them. Here  he can buy what any zoological museum is lacking and ardently wishing for at a very low price .../nTranslated excerpt from D\u00f6derlein's unpublished diary, dated April 1881[2]/nAt the end of the two-year period, D\u00f6derlein returned to Europe. Despite the difficulties associated with it, he brought his extensive collection of more than 3,550 specimens of at least 372 species back with him.[1][6] After his return, D\u00f6derlein became the director and curator of Mus\u00e9e zoologique de la ville de Strasbourg between 1882 and 1919. There he devoted much of his life cataloging its rich collection of marine fauna from the Far East. During his tenure, he hired specialists like Johannes Thiele, Franz Eilhard Schulze, and Arnold Edward Ortmann to study his Japanese collection. He also taught zoology at the University of Strasbourg during this period.[6]/nAt the turn of the century, he developed severe symptoms of tuberculosis. As a result, he was denied a promotion to Professor of Zoology because he could no longer teach effectively. From January to May 1901, in an effort to cure his ailment, he travelled to Biskra in Algeria where he spent most of his time studying the local fauna.[4]/nAfter the end of the First World War in 1919, Alsace was ceded back to France by Germany under the Treaty of Versailles. D\u00f6derlein was removed from directorship of the Museum of Strasbourg and was deported back to Germany by the French government. His family were not allowed to take anything with them per the treaty, forcing him to leave all his private property as well as his Japanese zoological collection behind. To make matters worse, Germany (then under the Weimar Republic) was struggling from the post-war economic depression.[1][2]/nAuch zur Fortsetzung meiner wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten komme ich kaum, obwohl ich fast t\u00e4glich mich im Museum besch\u00e4ftige.

He was mostly forgotten during the mid-Twentieth century until the rediscovery of his extensive collections at the Mus\u00e9e zoologique de la ville de Strasbourg by the Japanese marine biologist Shunsuke Mawatari. From 1997 to 2005, a Japanese team documented his collections in Strasbourg and other museums in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, revealing the true extent of his work. He is now recognized as one of the pioneers of natural history research in Japan.

In 1997, he graduated with a degree in biology from the Faculty of Science in Zagreb, after which he received his Ph.D. degree in genetics at the University of Cologne, Institute for Genetics in 2003./nTomislav claimed to have created a method of genomic philostratigraphy in 2007, in a presentation in the Hall of the Matthias of Croatia. Before this discovery, the only direct approach to the research of evolutionary history was to study and compare the fossil remains discovered at sites all over the world.[dubious  \u2013 discuss] Since it is impossible to predict where certain fossils are to be found, evolutionary research is largely dependent on good fortune in the discovery of high quality paleontological finds. The theory of genomic philostratigraphy solved this problem.[5][6][7]/nDomazet-Lo\u0161o and his associates have shown that parts of the organisms that are more exposed to the environment have a higher chance to be affected by environmental evolutionary changes. Furthermore, they  managed to show the sequence of so-called embryonic 'leaflets' that are produced in the newly conceived organism in the first days of development which is the cause of  further development of all other tissues.  Finally, they discovered a possible genetic cause of the so-called Cambrian explosion, an event that intrigued even Charles Darwin, when almost 540 million years ago in a geologically brief period, nearly all existing animal forms suddenly appeared in the fossil record. However, this method cannot see relatively tiny events like the separation of man and chimpanzee. The widely known scientific work of Dr. Tomislav Domazet-Lo\u0161 and his associates was premiered in Split at the 5th World Conference on Forensic Genetics and Molecular Anthropology.[8]/nDomazet's work is a powerful proof of the theory of evolution. Although it is assumed that the evolutionary history of the species in 200 years[clarification needed] has been mirrored in animal embryonic development, it has not been scientifically confirmed so far. Novelty is in the discovery of statistics-based genomic phylostratigraphy, which is based on statistics and which can measure the overall evolutionary age of active genes during each stage of embryonic development. The genomic phylostratiphraphic method is excellent for the reconstruction of the distant evolutionary past, for example, fifty million or one billion years old, which could only be studied solely with the help of fossils. The loin method was experimentally demonstrated three years ago and the research was done on a zebra fish. With the help of genomic phylostratigraphy, it has been shown that approximately in the middle of embryonic development there was a period when all vertebrae were morphologically similar. At this stage, which is called filetypes, differences in the appearance of fish, reptiles, and mammals are almost insignificant.[9][10]/nGenome phylostratigraphy opens up new chapters on research of hard-to-resolve problems in biology and medicine, and it could be particularly important to comprehend the research of tumor genetics. Domazet-Lo\u0161o and his team, for the first time, have shown in research on hydras that even simple organisms may have tumors. It follows that the possibility of tumor development is actually an immanent feature of multicellular organisms.[11][12][13][14]", "7260890": "Kim Soon-kwon (born May 1, 1945) is a South Korean maize specialist employed by Handong Global University./nKim, better known in Korea as \"Dr. Corn\" or in Africa as \"Green Revolutionary\", was born to a poor family in Ulsan, on the southeast coast.

It was said that central and western Africa weren't able to produce a hybrid, however Dr Kim continued to organize his efforts. He attempted to create varieties of cultivations, which could be helpful for farmers in Africa and elsewhere in the world, cultivations that resisted diseases.  In time, Kim made a hybrid for farms in Western and Central Africa, concluding with the \"Miracle of Central and Western Africa\".

This herb caused a loss of 7 billion dollars. Western investigators tried to beat the herb for 100 years, but without much effect.  Dr. Kim did not try to beat the herb, instead, he tried to create a variety of corn that could co-exist with the striga. After developing a new African hybrid of corn, the loss of production was reduced from 73% to 5%. His method can be applied not only to corn, but to rice, sorghum and other cultivations. These methods are believed to have resulted in gains of 1200 million dollars annually in benefits.

During her time working at the National Cancer Institute she was the Head of the Antiviral Unit at the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology./nIn 1995, Lisziewicz and her colleague Franco Lori founded the Research Institute for Genetic and Human Therapy (RIGHT), where Lisziewicz worked as the Director. RIGHT is a non-profit organization based in the United States and Italy that funds research to develop immunologic technologies, create new therapies, and research vaccines for many chronic diseases like HIV/AIDS. RIGHT strives to quickly put their discoveries to use in patient treatments.[1]/nLisziewicz founded Genetic Immunity, Inc., and worked as the President and the CEO of the company. Genetic Immunity is a private clinical-stage biotechnology company in the United States and Hungary. Genetic Immunity works to create and commercialize immunotherapeutic biologics to treat chronic viral infections, allergies, and cancers to prolong the life of the patient and improve their quality of life.[2]/nTREOS Bio is a company that develops precision vaccines to treat and prevent cancer using computational immune-oncology. Lisziewicz worked as the Chief Scientific Officer of TREOS Bio./nWhile working at the National Institute of Health, Lisziewicz worked to find a gene therapy approach to treat HIV/AIDS. She based her research on discovering if small portions of gene-stopping DNA (called antisense oligonucleotides) could be created to bind up the viral RNA in retroviruses like HIV so that the virus could not make more copies of itself to continue the infection. Small pieces of messenger RNA (or mRNA) carry a copy of the cell's DNA to the ribosomes where the mRNA directs the ribosomes to create the proteins that the cells need. Viruses (like HIV) have their own set of mRNA, and they use the ribosomes of the cell they infected to make new viruses to propagate the infection throughout the body. Lisziewicz's idea was to create antisense oligonucleotides that are complementary to the HIV's viral mRNA. These complementary DNA pieces can bind to the HIV viral mRNA and prevent the HIV virus from replicating itself. The use of antisense oligonucleotides worked very well in cell cultures, and was quickly transferred to clinical trials.[3][4]/nDermaVir immunotherapy was created during Lisziewicz's research at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. She worked to produce gene and antisense therapies to treat HIV/AIDS, and researched how the immune system controls HIV in tissue culture and in monkey models. She applied these results to the treatment of HIV patients in clinical trials. Lisziewicz discovered and headed the preclinical and clinical development of DermaVir HIV immunotherapy. Under Lisziewicz's direction, DermaVir successfully completed a Phase 2 clinical trial.[5]/nDermaVir is a topical vaccine that is applied with a patch to the skin. It is a new immunization strategy that uses dendritic cells to increase viral antigen production. DermaVir contains a plasmid that expresses all of the HIV proteins except integrase. This stimulates an immune response to attack the cells infected with HIV./nDermaVir has been proven safe and immunogenic in several clinical trials, one of which was in collaboration with the Division of AIDS (DAIDS). In one trial, Lisziewicz's research team compared the immunogenicity of topical-based and ex vivo dendritic cell-based DermaVir in rhesus macaques. As a result, it was discovered that both vaccinations induced CD4 helper T cells and CD8 memory T cells that are specific to simian immunodeficiency virus. The CD4 helper T cells and CD8 memory T cells were identified using an in vivo skin test and an in vitro intracellular cytokine-based assay. The topical DermaVir vaccine is an improvement upon the ex vivo dendritic cell- based immunization that could offer a new alternative therapy for patients with HIV.[6]/nAn investigation Lisziewicz was involved with when she was working at TREOS Bio is how human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes regulate immune responses. This research led to the development of a computational immune-oncology technology that can determine a patient's natural T cell response to tumor antigens. As a result, TREOS Bio found there was a correlation between a patient's HLA gene sequence and how well their immunotherapies worked. PolyPEPI\u2122 immunotherapies to treat a number of cancer indications were created by TREOS Bio using the computational immune-oncology. [7]/nLangerhans cells are a natural agent of antigen release. They are the precursors of dendritic cells in the skin and mucosa. Lisziewicz and her team developed synthetic nanoparticles that act like pathogens and specially target Langerhans cells in epidermal cell cultures. When these nanoparticles are applied topically to human subjects, a strong immune response was observed. This vaccine has been clinically proven, and it opens the door for more new dendritic cell-targeting vaccines to be created for the treatment of cancers.[8]", "70961945": "Adam C.

Gibson, exploring the biology of Trypanosoma brucei.[4] Kanmogne used a novel genetic technique at the time, random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD), to characterize the genetic heterogeneity of T. brucei gambiense isolates from endemic areas in Africa.[5] Her work was the first to show that the RAPD method is as accurate as the RFLP method at characterizing genetic variation, while also achieving a more detailed genetic analysis.[5] Kanmogne also explored more effective ways to diagnose sleeping sickness caused by T. brucei since its levels are very low.[6] She developed a novel PCR method that was highly sensitive and could be used to effectively diagnose sleeping sickness at levels of 25 trypanosomes/ml of blood.[6]/nKanmogne completed her graduate training in 1996, and stayed in the United Kingdom for her postdoctoral work at the University of Cambridge in the Department of Haematology.[7] She began studying HIV during her postdoc, specifically exploring the CD4+ T-lymphocyte levels in patients with AIDS as well as the specific biology of human T-cell leukaemia virus type I infection in West African patients with AIDS.[8]/nIn 1998, Kanmogne moved to the United States to pursue further postdoctoral training in the Department of Pathology at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center.[3] While continuing to study HIV, Kanmogne pursued a Master of Public Health in Biostatistics and Epidemiology at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center from 2000 to 2002.[3]/nUnder the mentorship of Ronald C. Kennedy, Kanmogne continued to study HIV, but now with an emphasis on the infiltration of HIV into the central nervous system and the lungs.[9]  Since the exact mechanisms of HIV invasion into the brain as well as subsequent neuronal cell death were unknown, Kanmogne's work explored the susceptibility of brain endothelial cells and cortical neurons to HIV-1 infection.[9] She discovered that neither cell type expressed the known HIV receptors, CXCR4 and CCR5, and thus other cell types or mechanisms just mediate CNS-HIV infection.[9] Kanmogne then explored using non-human primate (NHP) microglia to study HIV pathogenesis in the brain.[10] She found that NHP microglia express HIV-1 receptors and can be used to study HIV pathogenesis.[10]/nIn addition to studying HIV infection in the CNS, Kanmogne also explored HIV infection in  the lung since the onset of AIDS is associated with severe pulmonary complications.[11] She found that human lung microvascular endothelial cells are not a major reservoir of HIV in the lungs, but they do represent a target for the lethal effects of HIV viral proteins.[11]/nIn 2002, Kanmogne was hired as a research assistant professor in the Department of Pathology at the University of Oklahoma Health Science Center. She continued to study the vascular biology of HIV infection and the effects of HIV infection on the central nervous system.[7]/nKanmogne was then recruited to the University of Nebraska Medical Center in 2005 where she became an assistant professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Neuroscience, as well as a senior scientist in the Center for Neurovirology and Neurodegenerative Disorders.[7] In 2008, she was promoted to associate professor and became the vice chair for resource allocation and faculty development within the Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Neuroscience.[12] In 2012, Kanmogne received tenure and in 2015, she was promoted to full professor within the department.[12] Kanmogne is a member of the American Society for Virology and the International Society for NeuroVirology.[13]/nAt the University of Nebraska Medical Center, Kanmogne is also the principal investigator of a lab that explores the mechanisms of HIV-1 brain invasion and the vascular biology of HIV infection.[14] Her work has led to critical discoveries about the role of blood brain barrier (BBB) interactions with HIV as well as how these interactions influence the immune response in the brain leading to neuroAIDS, including neurodegeneration and AIDS associated dementia.[14] She has found that HIV affects the biology of the brain endothelium and that proximity of HIV-infected peripheral macrophages to the brain can lead to increased immune signalling, BBB facilitated infiltration of peripheral leukocytes into the brain.[14] Kanmogne is also deeply committed to extensive collaboration and diversity in academia.[1]  She currently collaborates with several departments within the University of Yaound\u00e9 in Cameroon and the University of California San Diego, and her international research project explores the viral genetic diversity of HIV infections in Cameroon and West Africa.[13] She hopes that her projects will enhance the ability of healthcare workers in Cameroon and West Africa to better diagnose and treat HIV.[15] Further, since Cameroon has some of the highest diversity of HIV strains and subtypes, her work exploring the genetic variants of HIV in relation to neurological symptoms will help to highlight potential disease trajectories associated with each subtype as well as open up possibilities for novel therapeutic development.[15]/nKanmogne and her colleagues discovered that the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, gp120, activates the CCR5 and CXCR4 receptors on the surface of human brain microvasculature endothelial cells (HBMECs) leading to toxicity and BBB leakage.[16] They further showed that blocking gp120 or its associated receptors actually prevents monocyte migration and permeability of the BBB via the PKC pathway.[16] Kanmogne and her colleagues later found that HIV-1 causes STAT-1 activation in HBMECs leading to IL-6 expression which mediates the recruitment of monocytes across the BBB.[17] To further delineate the mechanisms of HIV-infection leading to neuroinflammation, Kanmogne and her colleagues found that the CCR5 chemokine receptor mediated HIV-1 binding to HBMECs and that cross talk between STAT1 and PI3K pathways were mediating the BBB dysfunction after HIV infection.[18]/nKanmogne and her colleagues also hoped to explore the cognitive impairments due to HIV infection in Sub-Saharan Africa, so developed novel methods to do so.[19] The team reported the first normative data for executive function and verbal fluency in Cameroonians and this established the ability to use this method for future assessments of cognitive function in patients with and without HIV infection.[19] They further conducted a cross-sectional study of the HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) using the International HIV Dementia Scale among a population in Cameroon.[20] They found that the risk factors for HAND are similar to those described in other studies, underscoring the need to start to assess risk factors as a means of HANDS prevention in Cameroon.[20]/nIn order to treat the neurocognitive symptoms of HIV, therapeutics must enter the brain so Kanmogne and her team are developing novel nanomedicines to achieve this.[21] The first developed a nanoformulated crystalline antiretroviral therapy in 2012 which allows for drugs to be passed through the BBB through cell-to-cell contact between monocytes and HBMECs.[22] They found that the therapy in mice led to decreased activation of glial cells and decreased viral load in the spleen.[22] Next, they developed a method in 2018 that uses polyanhydride nanoparticles containing antioxidants that are internalized and then transferred from monocytes to HBMECs in order to protect neurons from oxidative stress associated with infection and inflammation.[21] This therapy showed positive results in its potential to be used as a method to enhance drug transport across the BBB.[21]", "69520249": "Nikolai

Her research was dedicated to understanding coral reef ecosystems, specifically coral-algal symbiosis and the capacity for corals to acclimatize under future climate change conditions.[2] Doctor Gates is most accredited with looking at coral biology and human-assisted coral evolution, known as super corals, as notably seen in the documentary Chasing Coral, available on Netflix.[3]/nGates was inspired by the documentary The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau.[4] She studied biology at Newcastle University where she earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1984.[5] She fell in love with corals during a diving trip to the West Indies.[6] In 1985 she moved to the West Indies to study corals.[4] She completed her PhD at Newcastle University in 1989 on seawater temperature and algal-cnidarian symbiosis.[1] During her postgraduate work in Jamaica, she was exposed to the bleaching response of coral resulting from rising temperatures.[7]/nAfter her PhD, Gates was appointed a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles.[5] Here she spent thirteen years working as a junior researcher in California, developing skills in cellular biology, evolutionary biology, and molecular genetics.[7] She was there during the 1998 bleaching event that killed more than 15% of corals across the world.[4]/nGates joined the Hawai\u02bbi Institute of Marine Biology in 2003.[8] She studied corals and reefs, learning how they function and working on ways to slow their decline.[8] She worked on Coconut Island, trying to identify why some corals survive bleaching.[9] Her group monitored the ecosystems of coral reefs to understand how a changing environment impacted coral health.[10] The corals in shallow patches like K\u0101ne\u02bbohe Bay are subject to high temperatures and irradiance.[10] Alongside seawater temperature, they measure photosynthetic active radiation, salinity and nutrient composition.[10] This allowed them to build 3D models of reefs.[11] They study the symbiodinium that live within coral tissues. These provide the corals with energy and are lost during coral bleaching.[12] They develop new techniques for data analysis and management, including developing EarthCube and CRESCYNT.[13][14] Gates was concerned about sunscreen that contains octinoxate and oxybenzone, and in 2015 called for it to be banned in Hawaii.[15] These sunscreens were banned in 2018.[16] In 2012 she demonstrated that the choice of symbiotic algae was crucial for how tropical reefs survived environmental stresses.[17][18] She predicted that more than 90 percent of the world's corals will be dead by 2050.[19]/nGates established the Gates Coral Lab at the Hawai\u02bbi Institute of Marine Biology. Even after the death of Ruth Gates in October 2018, her team continues on to conduct research centered around the biological traits of coral reef ecosystems. The team uses their research to inform restoration efforts and management policies.[20] Significant contributions to coral reef research has been contributed by the Gates Coral Lab. The team works in collaboration with the Australian Institute of Marine Science on the Coral Assisted Evolution Project, which attempts to \"stabilize and restore coral reefs\" in the face of climate change.[21]/nGates' research team hosted the first coral restoration workshop in Hawaii at the Hawai\u02bbi Institute of Marine Biology in 2017.[22] The research team's restoration efforts in Hawaii's coral reefs focus on realistic and effective approaches. Recent publications have discussed the necessity of focusing on local restoration and recovery efforts as opposed to mass scale restoration until there is more substantial research on how to best combat the root of the problem of bleaching events, climate change.[23] Other research and restoration publications have discussed the effects of beneficial mutations, genetic variation, and human assisted relocation.[24]/n\"Super corals\" were defined as those that did not bleach during natural bleaching events when sea temperatures were high.[7] Gates identified these so-called \"super corals\" as a potential mechanism for preventing coral extinction.[7] Gates said, \"I just cannot bear the idea that future generations may not experience a coral reef. The mission is to start solving the problem, not just to study it.\"[7] In 2013, she won the Paul G. Allen Ocean Challenge, a $10,000 prize that allowed her to improve the resilience of vulnerable coral reef ecosystems.[25][26] For the proposal, Gates joined Madeleine van Oppen, and used genetic selection to boost resilience to environmental stress.[25][27] They did this by exposing cross-bred corals to successively warmer and more acidic experimental tanks.[28][29][30][31] In the laboratory, they took resistant corals and collected their reproductive products after spawning, raised their offspring in the lab, and tested for increased temperature resistance.[7] Gates was awarded the University of Hawaii Board of Regents Medal for Excellence in Research.[32] Coral Assisted Evolution, a $4 million research project, was funded by the Paul G. Allen Frontiers Group.[33] This supported Gates' research for four years from 2016, developing super corals that can withstand climate change.[34] Whilst Gates was concerned about playing with nature, she could not sit by and watch species become extinct without acting.[35] In 2016, Gates was named by Hawaii Business as one of the top 20 leaders of Hawaii.[6] She explored whether non-super corals could be encouraged to take on new symbionts to improve their ability to withstand high temperatures.[36] If Gates' project is successful, it could save the US$9.9 trillion.[37] In 2018, the foundation supported a coral reef map, that allowed scientists to monitor corals in unprecedented detail.[38]/nIn addition to her career in research, Gates served as a mentor, public speaker, science communicator, and proponent for change and progress in the field of marine science.[7] She captivated and inspired audiences with her passion, optimism, and, as she modestly put it, her English boarding school accent.[7] She was elected the first female president of the International Society for Reef Studies in 2015 and significantly increased membership and involvement while she served.[7][39] The Super Coral proposals were featured in Fast Company, Gizmodo, PBS, Newsweek, Hawaii Business, National Geographic, the Huffington Post, New Scientist and the BBC.[40][41][42][43][44][45][46] Her work was featured in the Netflix documentary Chasing Coral.[47][48][49] She was an invited speaker at the 2017 Aspen Ideas Festival.[50] She was featured on the University of Hawai\u02bbi Foundation video series in 2018.[51][52] The Gates Coral Lab is involved in a wide range of public engagement and outreach, including hosting students from Mo'orea.[53] She was a member of the Tetiaroa Society.[8]/nGates' work at the Hawai\u02bbi Institute of Marine Biology is featured in the captivating Netflix documentary, Chasing Coral.[47] In the documentary, she explains her amazement with corals: \"I have the utmost respect for corals because I think they have got us all fooled. Simplicity on the outside does not mean simplicity on the inside.\"[47] The documentary showcases her work with Richard Vevers and the rest of his diving team on a project to capture the process of coral bleaching in the wild for the first time.[47] Gates provides the scientific foundation of knowledge for the conduction of this project, educating the team of divers and the audience of the film throughout.[47] She warns the audience of the \"eradication of an entire ecosystem in our lifespan\" to encourage progress in the movement against climate change.[47] Her appearance in Chasing Coral was one of Gates' several efforts of public outreach and engagement, working to raise awareness of coral bleaching and inspire the public to put a stop to these events.[54]/nGates was born in Akrotiri, Cyprus, the sister of Timothy Gates and the daughter of John Amos Gates (RAF) and Muriel Peel Gates (physiotherapist).[7] Her wife was Robin Burton-Gates, whom she married in September 2018. In her free time, she was an accomplished scuba diver, earned a black belt in karate, and started a school for karate in Hawaii.[7]/nGates was diagnosed with brain cancer at 56 years old,[55][56] but died from complications during a surgery for diverticulitis, unrelated to her former diagnosis.[57][58] Gates leaves a legacy of optimism and progress in the field of marine science: Van Oppen, the Gates Coral Lab, and multiple other labs across the globe, continue to study the mechanisms of resistance to climate change and how they may be passed down generations.[7]", "55856024": "Janet Edeme is a Nigerian agricultural scientist and plant biologist, who works as the Director of the Department of Rural Economy and Agriculture at the African Union Commission (AUC/DREA), based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

He aimed to study the impact of human influences on the Concholepas population. Within two years of excluding humans from one area, the population of Concholepas increased.[6] Using the results from this study, Castilla wanted to apply his findings to a real life scenario. With the Chilean government, Castilla implemented \"comanagement\" sections of the seashore. Castilla collected 3 years of data and found success in areas that were comanaged compared to the all-access areas.[3] This led Castilla and other researchers to lobby the Chilean government into enforcing comanagement on a broader scale./n/nThis article about a Chilean scientist is a stub.

Both the generation of RNA and formation of proteins are coupled to one another, akin to the coupling of a moving escalator with someone walking upon it.[2] Vogel has shown that both processes, the generation of RNA and the arrangement of RNA into proteins, are important. She demonstrated that the process of generating RNA from DNA is pulsed-like: brief spikes of activity that relax to a ground state, whereas the creation of proteins was more like an on-off switch.[2]/nVogel is interested in how genes respond to different stressors[3] and how certain environmental conditions can give rise to mutations such as cancer.[4] Amongst these genes, Vogel has studied BRCA1, which, if functioning properly, can prevent cells from dividing or growing. Mutations on the BRCA1 means that damage to DNA cannot be repaired, such that cells mutate and cause cancer.[4] Vogel believes that by understanding the pathways involved with these processes she will be able to design drugs to counter this BRCA1 mutation.[4] In 2019, her laboratory was named a Pressure BioSciences Center for Excellence.[5]/nVogel has served as an editor for PLoS Computational Biology.[6]/n2017 US Human Proteome Organization Robert J.
