He created and developed the geometry of numbers and used geometrical methods to solve problems in number theory, mathematical physics, and the theory of relativity./nMinkowski is perhaps best known for his foundational work describing space and time as a four-dimensional space, now known as \"Minkowski spacetime\", which facilitated geometric interpretations of Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity (1905)./nHermann Minkowski was born in the town of Aleksota, the Suwa\u0142ki Governorate, the Kingdom of Poland, since 1864 part of the Russian Empire, to Lewin Boruch Minkowski, a merchant who subsidized the building of the choral synagogue in Kovno,[3][4][5] and Rachel Taubmann, both of Jewish descent.[6] Hermann was a younger brother of the medical researcher Oskar (born 1858).[7] In different sources Minkowski's nationality is variously given as German,[8][9][10] Polish,[11][12][13] or Lithuanian-German,[14] or Russian.[1]/nTo escape Jewish persecution in the Russian Empire , the family moved to K\u00f6nigsberg in 1872,[15] where the father became involved in rag export and later in manufacture of mechanical clockwork tin toys (he operated his firm Lewin Minkowski & Son with his eldest son Max).[16]/nMinkowski studied in K\u00f6nigsberg and taught in Bonn (1887\u20131894), K\u00f6nigsberg (1894\u20131896) and Zurich (1896\u20131902), and finally in G\u00f6ttingen from 1902 until his death in 1909. He married Auguste Adler in 1897 with whom he had two daughters; the electrical engineer and inventor Reinhold Rudenberg was his son-in-law./nMinkowski died suddenly of appendicitis in G\u00f6ttingen on 12 January 1909.

In 1883, while still a student at K\u00f6nigsberg, he was awarded the Mathematics Prize of the French Academy of Sciences for his manuscript on the theory of quadratic forms. Due to the very young age of 18, which was unheard of in the mathematics community, and his obscurity as a mathematician at the time, his sharing the award with eminent English mathematician Henry Smith (who was certainly a great deal more famous than Hermann and to whom the prize was awarded posthumously) caused severe unrest among English mathematicians. The prize committee, despite the numerous complaints, never changed their decision. He also became a friend of another renowned mathematician, David Hilbert. His brother, Oskar Minkowski (1858\u20131931), was a well-known physician and researcher.[15]/nMinkowski taught at the universities of Bonn, K\u00f6nigsberg, Z\u00fcrich, and G\u00f6ttingen. At the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Polytechnikum, today the ETH Zurich, he was one of Einstein's teachers./nMinkowski explored the arithmetic of quadratic forms, especially concerning n variables, and his research into that topic led him to consider certain geometric properties in a space of n dimensions. In 1896, he presented his geometry of numbers, a geometrical method that solved problems in number theory. He is also the creator of the Minkowski Sausage[19] and the Minkowski cover[20] of a curve./nIn 1902, he joined the Mathematics Department of G\u00f6ttingen and became a close colleague of David Hilbert, whom he first met at university in K\u00f6nigsberg. Constantin Carath\u00e9odory was one of his students there./nBy 1908 Minkowski realized that the special theory of relativity, introduced by his former student Albert Einstein in 1905 and based on the previous work of Lorentz and Poincar\u00e9, could best be understood in a four-dimensional space, since known as the \"Minkowski spacetime\", in which time and space are not separated entities but intermingled in a four-dimensional space\u2013time, and in which the Lorentz geometry of special relativity can be effectively represented using the invariant interval \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\ny\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\nz\n\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n\nc\n\n2\n\n\n\nt\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-c^{2}t^{2}}\n\n (see History of special relativity)./nThe mathematical basis of Minkowski space can also be found in the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic space already known in the 19th century, because isometries (or motions) in hyperbolic space can be related to Lorentz transformations, which included contributions of Wilhelm Killing (1880, 1885), Henri Poincar\u00e9 (1881), Homersham Cox (1881), Alexander Macfarlane (1894) and others (see History of Lorentz transformations)./nThe beginning part of his address called \"Space and Time\" delivered at the 80th Assembly of German Natural Scientists and Physicians (21 September 1908) is now famous:/nThe views of space and time which I wish to lay before you have sprung from the soil of experimental physics, and therein lies their strength.

Born in Scotland, MacFarlane graduated from the University of Glasgow in 1728 and immigrated to the British colony of Jamaica, where he settled down to a career as a merchant and acquired several sugar plantations operated with slave labour./nIn addition to working as a judge and politician, MacFarlane also pursued an amateur career in astronomy in Port Royal and Kingston, using equipment purchased from fellow astronomer Colin Campbell. After his death in 1755, MacFarlane bequeathed his plantations to his brothers and his astronomical equipment to the University of Glasgow, which used it to establish an observatory, naming it Macfarlane Observatory in his honour./nAlexander MacFarlane was born in Scotland c.\u20091702.[1] His parents were John MacFarlane, who died in 1705, and Lady Helen Arbuthnot, the daughter of Robert Arbuthnot, 2nd Viscount of Arbuthnott; the Arbuthnot family's motto was Astra castra, Numen lumen (the stars my camp, the Lord my light).[2][3] The youngest of four sons, MacFarlane entered the University of Glasgow, graduating from the university with a Master of Arts degree in 1728. After he graduated, MacFarlane immigrated to the British colony of Jamaica.[4]/nAfter arriving in Jamaica, MacFarlane settled down to a career as a merchant and gradually acquired several landholdings in the colony.[4] In November 1735, having established himself as a prosperous trader and assistant judge who owned several sugar plantations, he was appointed as the first Postmaster General of Jamaica. MacFarlane also entered into a career in politics, being elected to the House of Assembly of Jamaica in 1754 representing Saint Elizabeth Parish.[2] In 1747, he purchased the \"Biscany\" plantation in Saint Elizabeth Parish from Benjamin Allan.[3]/nIn addition to his professional career, MacFarlane also developed an interest in astronomy and mathematics as well.[3] At a house he acquired in Port Royal, MacFarlane ordered the construction of an observatory, purchasing astronomy equipment from Colin Campbell, a fellow planter and astronomer who was an acquaintance of Sir Edmond Halley.[5] Campbell, a fellow of the Royal Society, had constructed an astronomy in Jamaica in 1731 to observe and catalogue the southern celestial hemisphere.[4]/nMacFarlane subsequently constructed an observatory at Kingston, Jamaica, having purchased all of Campbell's astronomy equipment by 1743 for the purpose of establishing an independent observatory. This observatory included a 4-foot mural arch, a 5-foot transit telescope, a 1-month regulator clock and a 5-foot zenith sector. However, MacFarlane found the zenith sector difficult to use, and so designed a new horizontal reflecting sector and in 1755 contracted Swiss instrument maker Pierre Martel, who regularly took care of MacFarlane's equipment, to build it for him.[4]/nIn November 1743, MacFarlane wrote a letter to Scottish telescope designer James Short, reporting on astronomical observations he had made in Jamaica. After receiving MacFarlane's letter, Short travelled to London and read it to his fellow members at the Royal Society, moving to nominate him as a fellow of the Royal Society. Though, as noted by historian David Clarke, MacFarlane's astronomical work was \"fairly minimal in modern terms\", he was made a fellow by the Royal Society on 20 November 1746. MacFarlane continued to send reports of his observations to the Royal Society until his death on 23 August 1755.[4] At the time of his death, he owned 791 slaves spread across six sugar plantations.[3]/nAfter his death, MacFarlane's astronomy in Kingston was converted by the colonial authorities into the Surrey County jail. As he died unmarried, MacFarlane left the majority of his estate in his will and testament to his two brothers, Walter and William; this included the \"Serge Island\", \"Biscany\", \"Bog Pen\", \"Glen Goff\", \"Lennox Castle\" and \"Windsor\" plantations.[2][3] His will also stipulated that all of his astronomical instruments would be donated to the University of Glasgow.[6] The equipment was transported from Jamaica to Scotland onboard the merchant ship Casar, and was damaged during the voyage due to exposure to the ocean air. After receiving them on 29 October 1756, the university contracted James Watt to repair them.[7] In the next year, the university established an observatory using MacFarlane's instruments, naming it Macfarlane Observatory in his honour.[8]/nIn the 21st century, MacFarlane's ownership of slaves has come under greater scrutiny. The University of Glasgow published a report titled \"Slavery, Abolition and The University of Glasgow\" in 2018 as part of its efforts towards a \"programme of reparatory justice\". In the report, which detailed the university's relationship with slavery and abolitionism, academics Stephen Mullen and Simon Newman noted that MacFarlane's ownership of slaves led to him acquiring a large fortune. Mullen and Newman also noted that despite the fact that MacFarlane's donation of the instruments proved vital to the foundation of the observatory in 1757, he did not provide any monetary support in his will to the university.[9]", "2913296": "Conway Maurice Berners-Lee (19 September 1921[2] \u2013 1 February 2019) was an English mathematician and computer scientist who worked as a member of the team that developed the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercial stored program electronic computer.[3][4] He was born in Birmingham in 1921[5] and was the father of Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, and Professor Mike Berners-Lee, researcher into climate change./nBerners-Lee was son of Major Cecil Burford Berners-Lee (1884\u20131931), of the Royal Field Artillery,[6] and Helen Lane Campbell Gray (1895\u20131968).

In addition, he attended a series of lectures in electronics. After university, he had further training in electronic engineering and soon joined the army in the Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME). He worked on Gun Laying and Searchlight Radar in England./nAfter the end of hostilities, Berners-Lee was posted to Egypt where he encountered Maurice Kendall's book The Advanced Theory of Statistics, which greatly impressed him. He then had a chance to join the statistics bureau in the GHQ in Cairo, known as the Number 1 Statistics Unit of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps. He was employed to close down a very large punched card installation involving about five million 65-column punched cards covering all types of vehicle and spares. This meant that they had to say goodbye to 30 women who had been punching the cards. The last job was sorting and listing the 250,000 personnel cards to get all the service people onto ships for home. There was a race with the clerks doing this job by hand\u2014and the clerks won over the machines.[3]/nBerners-Lee was demobilised in 1947 with the rank of Major. He then worked on a punched card data processing system for the Plastics Division of Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI).

She had been working as a programmer on the Ferranti Mark 1 and Mark 1 Star computers at the Department of Computer Science, University of Manchester since 1951.[10][11] He joined Ferranti in 1953 working at Ferranti's London Computer Centre.[12] They were married on 10 July 1954 at St Saviour's Church, Hampstead.[13]/nThe following is an extract from Dominic Wilson's book Organizational Marketing.[14]/nIn Manchester, nearly half the programmers were women, Conway Berners-Lee, who married one of them, said 'Ferranti hired intelligent girls very cheaply but this gave them a big cultural problem because, prior to that, the company had only employed women as typists or factory hands'. 'Men got more than women', Mary Lee added. 'It was grossly unfair and there was a rebellion. The personnel officer was shocked we'd even discussed our wages.' She was on \u00a3400 a year.

They'd been the culmination of a measured progress from military radar work to academia to commerce, and the heroically named 'Pegasus\u2019 computers had made Ferranti a lot of money./nIn the 1950s it was not clear how computers could usefully be employed away from the field of mathematics.[15] As well as statistics, Berners-Lee had acquired a knowledge of operations research (OR), and he showed himself to be good at devising worthwhile computer applications. He directed the development of routines for the basic data processing techniques of sorting and updating files. In 1956 he devised an application for planning the production of items from a variety of components, for example, animal feed products. In 1957 he published an article on machine loading.[15] A report that he produced in 1964 listed 31 Ferranti projects that used OR techniques in a wide variety of businesses.[12]/nThe business computing division of Ferranti was merged with International Computers and Tabulators (ICT) in 1963, and ICT was, in turn, merged with English Electric Leo Marconi (EELM) computers in 1968 to form International Computers Limited (ICL)./nIn 1960 Berners-Lee had evolved a technique for editing text\u2014including hyphenation\u2014for metal typesetting of printed material. As space in memory and backing store was a scarce and valuable resource in those days, he had also devised a procedure for compressing text, which in 1963 he sent to Bob Bemer at Univac.[16]/nIn the late 1960s Berners-Lee led the Medical Development Team of ICT and then ICL. He was involved in some of the earliest developments in the applications of computers in medicine, and his text compression ideas were taken up by an early electronic patient record system.[17]/nBerners-Lee spent the 1970s developing and using a queuing network model[18] for ICL's 'New Range' of computers (later the ICL 2900 Series) with Dr John Pinkerton who was responsible for optimising the price/performance of the new systems. It was known as FAST \u2013 standing for Football Analogy for System Throughput.[19][20] The work done by each 'player' was derived from a system monitor file containing data for device and concurrency counts.

Initially, she chose Bryn Mawr College, where she worked with Hilda Geiringer on genetics. In 1942 at the invitation of Harold Hotelling she transferred to Columbia University. She disliked the cold atmosphere and remote faculty there, and returned to Bryn Mawr after a year, but continued working with Hotelling. Without completing her doctorate, she took a faculty position at George Washington University.

The programs for these computers were written in machine code, and there was plenty of room for error because every bit had to be right.[6] The machines used serial 40-bit arithmetic (with a double length accumulator), which meant that there were considerable difficulties in scaling the variables in the program to maintain adequate arithmetic precision.[7]/nThe Ferranti programming team members found it useful to commit the following sequence of characters to memory, which represented the numbers 0\u201331 in the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 1, which was a 5-bit binary code of the paper tape that was used for input and output:/nAnother difficulty of programming the Ferranti Mark 1 computers was the two-level storage of the computers. There were eight pages of Williams cathode ray tube (CRT) random access memory as the fast primary store, and 512 pages of the secondary store on a magnetic drum. Each page consisted of thirty-two 40-bit words, which appeared as sixty-four 20-bit lines on the CRTs. The programmer had to control all transfers between electronic and magnetic storage, and the transfers were slow and had to be reduced to a minimum. For programs dealing with large chunks of data, such as matrices, partitioning the data into page-sized chunks could be troublesome./nThe Ferranti Mark 1 computer worked in integer arithmetic, and the engineers built the computer to display the lines of data on the CRTs with the most significant bit on the right due to their background in radar. This could be argued as the logically sensible choice, but was changed to the more conventional system of the most significant bit on the left for the Mark 1 Star. The Mark 1 Star worked with both fractions and integers.[7] The Baudot teleprinter code was also abandoned for one that was in the following order:[8]/nProgram errors for the Ferranti Mark 1 computers were difficult to find. Programmers would sit at the computer control desk and watch the computer perform one instruction at a time in order to see where unintended events occurred. However, computer time became more and more valuable, so Dr Bennett suggested that Woods write a diagnostic program to print out the contents of the accumulator and particular store lines at specific points in the program so that error diagnosis could take place away from the computer. The challenge of her routine, 'Stopandprint', was that it had to monitor the program under diagnosis without interfering with it, and the limited space in the fast store made this difficult. Along with Bennet and Dr D.G. Prinz, Woods was involved in writing interpretive subroutines that were used by the Ferranti group.[7][9][10]/nErrors with the programs were one problem, but errors caused by the computer were another. The computer frequently misread the binary digits it was given. The engineers thought the mathematicians could compensate for this by programming arithmetic checks, and the mathematicians would too readily assume that a wrong program result was due to a computer error when it was due to a program error. This caused inevitable friction between the mathematicians and the engineers. At the centre of this was a program that Woods had written for inverting a matrix to solve 40 simultaneous equations, which was a large number for the time. The long rows of data required by this calculation took the computer too long to process without an error. For one dispute Woods went to Tom Kilburn, who was second only to Professor Sir Frederic Calland Williams in the engineering department. Kilburn was polite but did not argue, and she felt he was ignoring her complaint. However, 50 years later when she asked him about the exchange, he said that he had not argued \"because [he] knew [she was] right.\"[11]/nWhile at Ferranti, Woods discovered that the women in her department were getting less pay than the men. She presented the case to the personnel department and was able to convince them to grant equal pay and rights for women.[12]/nWoods left Ferranti in 1955, when her first child was born. She continued to get involved in smaller programming projects, that she termed \"cottage industry programming,\"[5] so that she could complete jobs from home. Most notably she did some work with the London Transport Executive, to develop a simulation for bus routes that could prevent hold ups and bus bunching. She also developed a program for the RAF at Boscombe Down to track weather balloons and translate their readings. Then she came out of retirement in 1963 to work for a London-based company called K and H. While at K and H she wrote programming manuals until she retired in 1987./nIn 1954 she married Conway Berners-Lee whom she met while working in the Ferranti team, and together they had four children; Timothy (Tim), Peter, Helen and Michael (Mike). Their eldest son, Sir Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the World Wide Web, and their youngest son Mike is an academic.[13][14][15]/nAfter a period devoted to bringing up children, she became a schoolteacher of mathematics, and then a programmer using BASIC, Fortran and other languages before retiring in 1987./nShe died on 29 November 2017, aged 93.[16][5]", "28046363": "G\u00e1bor Hal\u00e1sz (born 25 December 1941, in Budapest) is a Hungarian mathematician.

The Sagnac effect manifests itself in a setup called a ring interferometer or Sagnac interferometer. A beam of light is split and the two beams are made to follow the same path but in opposite directions. On return to the point of entry the two light beams are allowed to exit the ring and undergo interference. The relative phases of the two exiting beams, and thus the position of the interference fringes, are shifted according to the angular velocity of the apparatus. In other words, when the interferometer is at rest with respect to a nonrotating frame, the light takes the same amount of time to traverse the ring in either direction. However, when the interferometer system is spun, one beam of light has a longer path to travel than the other in order to complete one circuit of the mechanical frame, and so takes longer, resulting in a phase difference between the two beams. Georges Sagnac set up this experiment in 1913 in an attempt to prove the existence of the aether that Einstein's theory of special relativity makes superfluous.[1][2]/nA gimbal mounted mechanical gyroscope remains pointing in the same direction after spinning up, and thus can be used as a rotational reference for an inertial navigation system. With the development of so-called laser gyroscopes and fiber optic gyroscopes based on the Sagnac effect, bulky mechanical gyroscopes can be replaced by those with no moving parts in many modern inertial navigation systems. A conventional gyroscope relies on the principle of conservation of angular momentum whereas the sensitivity of the ring interferometer to rotation arises from the invariance of the speed of light for all inertial frames of reference./nTypically three or more mirrors are used, so that counter-propagating light beams follow a closed path such as a triangle or square (Fig.\u00a01).  Alternatively fiber optics can be employed to guide the light through a closed path (Fig.\u00a02). If the platform on which the ring interferometer is mounted is rotating, the interference fringes are displaced compared to their position when the platform is not rotating. The amount of displacement is proportional to the angular velocity of the rotating platform. The axis of rotation does not have to be inside the enclosed area. The phase shift of the interference fringes is proportional to the platform's angular frequency \n\n\n\n\n\u03c9\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {\\omega }}}\n\n and is given by a formula originally derived by Sagnac:\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\u03d5\n\u2248\n\n\n\n8\n\u03c0\n\n\n\u03bb\nc\n\n\n\n\n\u03c9\n\n\u22c5\n\nA\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta \\phi \\approx {\\frac {8\\pi }{\\lambda c}}{\\boldsymbol {\\omega }}\\cdot \\mathbf {A} }\n\nwhere \n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {A} }\n\n is the oriented area of the loop and \n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n\n the wavelength of light./nThe effect is a consequence of the different times it takes right and left moving light beams to complete a full round trip in the interferometer ring.

To test this hypothesis, Oliver Lodge in 1897 proposed that a giant ring interferometer be constructed to measure the rotation of the Earth; a similar suggestion was made by Albert Abraham Michelson in 1904. They hoped that with such an interferometer, it would be possible to decide between a stationary aether, versus aethers which are partially or completely dragged by the Earth. That is, if the hypothetical aether were carried along by the Earth (or by the interferometer) the result would be negative, while a stationary aether would give a positive result.[3][4][5]/nThe first description of the Sagnac effect in the framework of special relativity was done by Max von Laue in 1911,[6][7] two years before Sagnac conducted his experiment. By continuing the theoretical work of Michelson (1904), von Laue confined himself to an inertial frame of reference (which he called a \"valid\" reference frame), and in a footnote he wrote \"a system which rotates in respect to a valid system \n\n\n\n\nK\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle K^{0}}\n\n is not valid\".[6] Assuming constant light speed \n\n\n\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c}\n\n, and setting the rotational velocity as \n\n\n\n\u03c9\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\omega }\n\n, he computed the propagation time \n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\tau _{+}}\n\n of one ray and \n\n\n\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\tau _{-}}\n\n of the counter-propagating ray, and consequently obtained the time difference \n\n\n\n\u0394\n\u03c4\n=\n\n\u03c4\n\n+\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u2212\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta \\tau =\\tau _{+}-\\tau _{-}}\n\n. He concluded that this interferometer experiment would indeed produce (when restricted to terms of first order in \n\n\n\nv\n\n/\n\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v/c}\n\n) the same positive result for both special relativity and the stationary aether (the latter he called \"absolute theory\" in reference to the 1895-theory of Lorentz). He also concluded that only complete-aether-drag models (such as the ones of Stokes or Hertz) would give a negative result.[6]/nThe first interferometry experiment aimed at observing the correlation of angular velocity and phase-shift was performed by the French scientist Georges Sagnac in 1913. Its purpose was to detect \"the effect of the relative motion of the ether\".[1][2] Sagnac believed that his results constituted proof of the existence of a stationary aether. However, as explained above, von Laue already showed in 1911 that this effect is consistent with special relativity.[6][7] Unlike the carefully prepared Michelson\u2013Morley experiment which was set up to prove an aether wind caused by earth drag, the Sagnac experiment could not prove this type of aether wind because a universal aether would affect all parts of the rotating light equally./nEinstein was aware of the phenomenon of the Sagnac effect through the earlier experiments of Franz Harress[8] in 1911. Harress' experiment had been aimed at making measurements of the Fresnel drag of light propagating through moving glass. Not aware of the Sagnac effect, Harress had realized the presence of an \"unexpected bias\" in his measurements, but was unable to explain its cause.[9] Harress' analysis of the results contained an error, and they were reanalyzed in 1914 by Paul Harzer, who claimed the results were at odds with special relativity.[10] This was rebutted by Einstein.[11][12] Harress himself died during the First World War, and his results were not publicly available until von Laue persuaded Otto Knopf,[13] whose assistant Harress had been, to publish them in 1920.[14][15]/nHarress' results were published together with an analysis by von Laue, who showed the role of the Sagnac effect in the experiment.[9] Laue said that in the Harress experiment there was a calculable difference in time due to both the dragging of light (which follows from the relativistic velocity addition in moving media, i.e. in moving glass) and \"the fact that every part of the rotating apparatus runs away from one ray, while it approaches the other one\", i.e. the Sagnac effect. He acknowledged that this latter effect alone could cause the time variance and, therefore, \"the accelerations connected with the rotation in no way influence the speed of light\".[9]/nWhile Laue's explanation is based on inertial frames, Paul Langevin (1921, 1937) and others described the same effect when viewed from rotating reference frames (in both special and general relativity, see Born coordinates). So when the Sagnac effect should be described from the viewpoint of a corotating frame, one can use ordinary rotating cylindrical coordinates and apply them to the Minkowski metric, which results into the so-called Born metric or Langevin metric.[16][17][18] From these coordinates, one can derive the different arrival times of counter-propagating rays, an effect which was shown by Paul Langevin (1921).[19] Or when these coordinates are used to compute the global speed of light in rotating frames, different apparent light speeds are derived depending on the orientation, an effect which was shown by Langevin in another paper (1937).[20]/nThis does not contradict special relativity and the above explanation by von Laue that the speed of light is not affected by accelerations. Because this apparent variable light speed in rotating frames only arises if rotating coordinates are used, whereas if the Sagnac effect is described from the viewpoint of an external inertial coordinate frame the speed of light of course remains constant \u2013 so the Sagnac effect arises no matter whether one uses inertial coordinates (see the formulas in section \u00a7\u00a0Theories below) or rotating coordinates (see the formulas in section \u00a7\u00a0Reference frames below). That is, special relativity in its original formulation was adapted to inertial coordinate frames, not rotating frames. Albert Einstein in his paper introducing special relativity stated, \"light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity c which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body\".[21] Einstein specifically stated that light speed is only constant in the vacuum of empty space, using equations that only held in linear and parallel inertial frames. However, when Einstein started to investigate accelerated reference frames, he noticed that \"the principle of the constancy of light must be modified\" for accelerating frames of reference.[22]/nMax von Laue in his 1920 paper gave serious consideration to the effect of General Relativity on the Sagnac effect stating, \"General relativity would of course be capable of giving some statements about it, and we want to show at first that no noticeable influences of acceleration are expected according to it.\" He makes a footnote regarding discussions with German physicist, Wilhelm Wien.[9] The reason for looking at General Relativity is because Einstein's Theory of General Relativity predicted that light would slow down in a gravitational field which is why it could predict the curvature of light around a massive body. Under General Relativity, there is the equivalence principle which states that gravity and acceleration are equivalent. Spinning or accelerating an interferometer creates a gravitational effect. \"There are, however, two different types of such [non-inertial] motion; it may for instance be acceleration in a straight line, or circular motion with constant speed.\"[23] Also, Irwin Shapiro in 1964 explained General Relativity saying, \"the speed of a light wave depends on the strength of the gravitational potential along its path\". This is called the Shapiro delay.[24] However, since the gravitational field would have to be significant, Laue (1920) concluded it is more likely that the effect is a result of changing the distance of the path by its movement through space.[9] \"The beam traveling around the loop in the direction of rotation will have farther to go than the beam traveling counter to the direction of rotation, because during the period of travel the mirrors and detector will all move (slightly) toward the counter-rotating beam and away from the co-rotating beam. Consequently the beams will reach the detector at slightly different times, and slightly out of phase, producing optical interference 'fringes' that can be observed and measured.\"[25]/nIn 1926, an ambitious ring interferometry experiment was set up by Albert Michelson and Henry Gale. The aim was to find out whether the rotation of the Earth has an effect on the propagation of light in the vicinity of the Earth. The Michelson\u2013Gale\u2013Pearson experiment was a very large ring interferometer, (a perimeter of 1.9 kilometer), large enough to detect the angular velocity of the Earth. The outcome of the experiment was that the angular velocity of the Earth as measured by astronomy was confirmed to within measuring accuracy. The ring interferometer of the Michelson\u2013Gale experiment was not calibrated by comparison with an outside reference (which was not possible, because the setup was fixed to the Earth). From its design it could be deduced where the central interference fringe ought to be if there would be zero shift. The measured shift was 230 parts in 1000, with an accuracy of 5 parts in 1000. The predicted shift was 237 parts in 1000.[26]/nThe Sagnac effect has stimulated a century long debate on its meaning and interpretation,[27][28][29] much of this debate being surprising since the effect is perfectly well understood in the context of special relativity./nThe shift in interference fringes in a ring interferometer can be viewed intuitively as a consequence of the different distances that light travels due to the rotation of the ring.(Fig.\u00a03)[30] The simplest derivation is for a circular ring of radius R, with a refractive index of one, rotating at an angular velocity of \n\n\n\n\u03c9\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\omega }\n\n, but the result is general for loop geometries with other shapes. If a light source emits in both directions from one point on the rotating ring, light traveling in the same direction as the rotation direction needs to travel more than one circumference around the ring before it catches up with the light source from behind. The time \n\n\n\n\nt\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t_{1}}\n\n that it takes to catch up with the light source is given by:/n\u0394\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta L}\n\n is the distance (black bold arrow in Fig.\u00a03) that the mirror has moved in that same time:/nEliminating \n\n\n\n\u0394\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta L}\n\n from the two equations above we get:/nLikewise, the light traveling in the opposite direction of the rotation will travel less than one circumference before hitting the light source on the front side.  So the time for this direction of light to reach the moving source again is:/nThe time difference is/nFor \n\n\n\nR\n\u03c9\n=\nv\n\u226a\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R\\omega =v\\ll c}\n\n, this reduces to/nwhere A is the area of the ring./nAlthough this simple derivation is for a circular ring with an index of refraction of one, the result holds true for any shape of rotating loop with area\u00a0A.(Fig.\u00a04)/nFor more complicated shapes, or other refractive index values, the same result can be derived by calculating the optical phase shift in each direction using Fermat's principle and taking into account the different phase velocities for the different propagation directions in an inertial laboratory frame, which can be calculated using relativistic addition of velocities.[31]/nWe imagine a screen for viewing fringes placed at the light source (or we use a beamsplitter to send light from the source point to the screen). Given a steady light source, interference fringes will form on the screen with a fringe displacement proportional to the time differences required for the two counter-rotating beams to traverse the circuit. The phase shift is \n\n\n\n\u0394\n\u03d5\n=\n\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\nc\n\n\u0394\nt\n\n\u03bb\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta \\phi ={\\frac {2\\pi c\\,\\Delta t}{\\lambda }}}\n\n, which causes fringes to shift in proportion to \n\n\n\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\u03c9\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\omega }\n\n ./nAt non-relativistic speeds, the Sagnac effect is a simple consequence of the source independence of the speed of light. In other words, the Sagnac experiment does not distinguish between pre-relativistic physics and relativistic physics.[30]/nWhen light propagates in fibre optic cable, the setup is effectively a combination of a Sagnac experiment and the Fizeau experiment. In glass the speed of light is slower than in vacuum, and the optical cable is the moving medium. In that case the relativistic velocity addition rule applies. Pre-relativistic theories of light propagation cannot account for the Fizeau effect. (By 1900 Lorentz could account for the Fizeau effect, but by that time his theory had evolved to a form where in effect it was mathematically equivalent to special relativity.)/nSince emitter and detector are traveling at the same speeds, Doppler effects cancel out, so the Sagnac effect does not involve the Doppler effect. In the case of ring laser interferometry, it is important to be aware of this. When the ring laser setup is rotating, the counterpropagating beams undergo frequency shifts in opposite directions. This frequency shift is not a Doppler shift, but is rather an optical cavity resonance effect, as explained below in Ring lasers./nThe Sagnac effect is well understood in the context of special relativity where from the rotating light source's point of view the phase difference is due to the line of simultaneity along the light path not forming a closed loop in spacetime.[32]/nModified versions of the experiment have been proposed[33] with the light source allowed to move along a (not necessarily circular) light path. This configuration introduces another reason for the phase difference: according to the light source the two signals now follow different paths in space. Some authors refer to this effect as Sagnac effect[29][34] although in this case the discrepancy need not be due to the lines of simultaneity not forming closed loops./nAn example of the modified configuration is shown in Fig.\u00a05, the measured phase difference in both a standard fibre optic gyroscope, shown on the left, and a modified fibre optic conveyor, shown on the right, conform to the equation \u0394t\u00a0=\u00a02vL/c2, whose derivation is based on the constant speed of light. It is evident from this formula that the total time delay is equal to the cumulative time delays along the entire length of fibre, regardless whether the fibre is in a rotating section of the conveyor, or a straight section./nThis equation is invalid, however, if the light source's path in space does not follow that of the light signals, for example in the standard rotating platform case (FOG) but with a non-circular light path. In this case the phase difference formula necessarily involves the area enclosed by the light path due to Stokes' theorem.[32]/nConsider a ring interferometer where two counter-propagating light beams share a common optical path determined by a loop of an optical fiber, see Figure 4.  The loop may have an arbitrary shape, and can move arbitrarily in space.  The only restriction is that it is not allowed to stretch. (The case of a circular ring interferometer rotating about its center in free space is recovered by taking the index of refraction of the fiber to be 1.)/nConsider a small segment of the fiber, whose length in its rest frame is \n\n\n\nd\n\n\u2113\n\u2032\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d\\ell '}\n\n.

In 1984 a verification was set up that involved three ground stations and several GPS satellites, with relays of signals both going eastward and westward around the world.[36] In the case of a Sagnac interferometer a measure of difference in arrival time is obtained by producing interference fringes, and observing the fringe shift. In the case of a relay of pulses around the world the difference in arrival time is obtained directly from the actual arrival time of the pulses. In both cases the mechanism of the difference in arrival time is the same: the Sagnac effect./nThe Hafele\u2013Keating experiment is also recognized as a counterpart to Sagnac effect physics.[36] In the actual Hafele\u2013Keating experiment[37] the mode of transport (long-distance flights) gave rise to time dilation effects of its own, and calculations were needed to separate the various contributions. For the (theoretical) case of clocks that are transported so slowly that time dilation effects arising from the transport are negligible the amount of time difference between the clocks when they arrive back at the starting point will be equal to the time difference that is found for a relay of pulses that travels around the world: 207 nanoseconds./nThe Sagnac effect is employed in current technology. One use is in inertial guidance systems. Ring laser gyroscopes are extremely sensitive to rotations, which need to be accounted for if an inertial guidance system is to return accurate results. The ring laser also can detect the sidereal day, which can also be termed \"mode 1\". Global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs), such as GPS, GLONASS, COMPASS or Galileo, need to take the rotation of the Earth into account in the procedures of using radio signals to synchronize clocks./nFibre optic gyroscopes are sometimes referred to as 'passive ring interferometers'. A passive ring interferometer uses light entering the setup from outside. The interference pattern that is obtained is a fringe pattern, and what is measured is a phase shift./nIt is also possible to construct a ring interferometer that is self-contained, based on a completely different arrangement. This is called a ring laser or ring laser gyroscope. The light is generated and sustained by incorporating laser excitation in the path of the light./nTo understand what happens in a ring laser cavity, it is helpful to discuss the physics of the laser process in a laser setup with continuous generation of light. As the laser excitation is started, the molecules inside the cavity emit photons, but since the molecules have a thermal velocity, the light inside the laser cavity is at first a range of frequencies, corresponding to the statistical distribution of velocities. The process of stimulated emission makes one frequency quickly outcompete other frequencies, and after that the light is very close to monochromatic./nFor the sake of simplicity, assume that all emitted photons are emitted in a direction parallel to the ring. Fig.\u00a07 illustrates the effect of the ring laser's rotation. In a linear laser, an integer multiple of the wavelength fits the length of the laser cavity. This means that in traveling back and forth the laser light goes through an integer number of cycles of its frequency. In the case of a ring laser the same applies: the number of cycles of the laser light's frequency is the same in both directions. This quality of the same number of cycles in both directions is preserved when the ring laser setup is rotating. The image illustrates that there is wavelength shift (hence a frequency shift) in such a way that the number of cycles is the same in both directions of propagation./nBy bringing the two frequencies of laser light to interference a beat frequency can be obtained; the beat frequency is the difference between the two frequencies. This beat frequency can be thought of as an interference pattern in time. (The more familiar interference fringes of interferometry are a spatial pattern). The period of this beat frequency is linearly proportional to the angular velocity of the ring laser with respect to inertial space. This is the principle of the ring laser gyroscope, widely used in modern inertial navigation systems./nIn passive ring interferometers, the fringe displacement is proportional to the first derivative of angular position; careful calibration is required to determine the fringe displacement that corresponds to zero angular velocity of the ring interferometer setup. On the other hand, ring laser interferometers do not require calibration to determine the output that corresponds to zero angular velocity. Ring laser interferometers are self-calibrating. The beat frequency will be zero if and only if the ring laser setup is non-rotating with respect to inertial space./nFig.\u00a08 illustrates the physical property that makes the ring laser interferometer self-calibrating. The grey dots represent molecules in the laser cavity that act as resonators. Along every section of the ring cavity, the speed of light is the same in both directions. When the ring laser device is rotating, then it rotates with respect to that background. In other words: invariance of the speed of light provides the reference for the self-calibrating property of the ring laser interferometer./nRing laser gyroscopes suffer from an effect known as \"lock-in\" at low rotation rates (less than 100\u00b0/h). At very low rotation rates, the frequencies of the counter-propagating laser modes become almost identical. In this case, crosstalk between the counter-propagating beams can result in injection locking, so that the standing wave \"gets stuck\" in a preferred phase, locking the frequency of each beam to each other rather than responding to gradual rotation. By rotationally dithering the laser cavity back and forth through a small angle at a rapid rate (hundreds of hertz), lock-in will only occur during the brief instances where the rotational velocity is close to zero; the errors thereby induced approximately cancel each other between alternating dead periods./nFibre optic gyros (FOGs) and ring laser gyros (RLGs) both operate by monitoring the difference in propagation time between beams of light traveling in clockwise and counterclockwise directions about a closed optical path. They differ considerably in various cost, reliability, size, weight, power, and other performance characteristics that need to be considered when evaluating these distinct technologies for a particular application./nRLGs require accurate machining, use of precision mirrors, and assembly under clean room conditions. Their mechanical dithering assemblies add somewhat to their weight but not appreciably.[citation needed]  RLGs are capable of logging in excess of 100,000 hours of operation in near-room temperature conditions.[citation needed]  Their lasers have relatively high power requirements.[38]/nInterferometric FOGs are purely solid-state, require no mechanical dithering components, do not require precision machining, have a flexible geometry, and can be made very small. They use many standard components from the telecom industry.  In addition, the major optical components of FOGs have proven performance in the telecom industry, with lifespans measured in decades.[39] However, the assembly of multiple optical components into a precision gyro instrument is costly.  Analog FOGs offer the lowest possible cost but are limited in performance; digital FOGs offer the wide dynamic ranges and accurate scale factor corrections required for stringent applications.[40] Use of longer and larger coils increases sensitivity at the cost of greater sensitivity to temperature variations and vibrations./nThe Sagnac topology was actually first described by Michelson in 1886,[41] who employed an even-reflection variant of this interferometer in a repetition of the Fizeau experiment.[42] Michelson noted the extreme stability of the fringes produced by this form of interferometer: White-light fringes were observed immediately upon alignment of the mirrors. In dual-path interferometers, white-light fringes are difficult to obtain since the two path lengths must be matched to within a couple of micrometers (the coherence length of the white light). However, being a common-path interferometer, the Sagnac configuration inherently matches the two path lengths. Likewise Michelson observed that the fringe pattern would remain stable even while holding a lighted match below the optical path; in most interferometers the fringes would shift wildly due to the refractive index fluctuations from the warm air above the match. Sagnac interferometers are almost completely insensitive to displacements of the mirrors or beam-splitter.[43] This characteristic of the Sagnac topology has led to their use in applications requiring exceptionally high stability./nThe fringe shift in a Sagnac interferometer due to rotation has a magnitude proportional to the enclosed area of the light path, and this area must be specified in relation to the axis of rotation. Thus the sign of the area of a loop is reversed when the loop is wound in the opposite direction (clockwise or anti-clockwise). A light path that includes loops in both directions, therefore, has a net area given by the difference between the areas of the clockwise and anti-clockwise loops. The special case of two equal but opposite loops is called a zero-area Sagnac interferometer. The result is an interferometer that exhibits the stability of the Sagnac topology while being insensitive to rotation.[44]/nThe Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) consisted of two 4-km Michelson\u2013Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot interferometers, and operated at a power level of about 100 watts of laser power at the beam splitter. After an upgrade to Advanced LIGO several kilowatts of laser power are required./nA variety of competing optical systems are being explored for third generation enhancements beyond Advanced LIGO.[45] One of these competing proposals is based on the zero-area Sagnac design. With a light path consisting of two loops of the same area, but in opposite directions, an effective area of zero is obtained thus canceling the Sagnac effect in its usual sense. Although insensitive to low frequency mirror drift, laser frequency variation, reflectivity imbalance between the arms, and thermally induced birefringence, this configuration is nevertheless sensitive to passing gravitational waves at frequencies of astronomical interest.[44] However, many considerations are involved in the choice of an optical system, and despite the zero-area Sagnac's superiority in certain areas, there is as yet no consensus choice of optical system for third generation LIGO.[46][47]", "47772708": "Mary Catherine Silber is a professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago who works on dynamical systems, in bifurcation theory and pattern formation.[1]/nSilber completed her Ph.D. in physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1989, under the supervision of Edgar Knobloch.

Demazure's work in this area was marred by a dependence on a false lemma in an earlier paper (also by Demazure); the flaw was pointed out by Victor Kac, and subsequent research clarified the conditions under which the formula remains valid.[13]/nLater in his career, Demazure's research emphasis shifted from pure mathematics to more computational problems, involving the application of algebraic geometry to image reconstruction problems in computer vision.[14] The Kruppa\u2013Demazure theorem, stemming from this work, shows that if a scene consisting of five points is viewed from two cameras with unknown positions but known focal lengths then, in general, there will be exactly ten different scenes that could have generated the same two images.

Like many Pythagoreans, Nicomachus wrote about the mystical properties of numbers, best known for his works Introduction to Arithmetic and Manual of Harmonics, which are an important resource on Ancient Greek mathematics and Ancient Greek music in the Roman period. Nicomachus' work on arithmetic became a standard text for Neoplatonic education in Late antiquity, with philosophers such as Iamblichus and John Philoponus writing commentaries on it. A Latin paraphrase by Boethius of Nicomachus's works on arithmetic and music became standard textbooks in medieval education./nLittle is known about the life of Nicomachus except that he was a Pythagorean who came from Gerasa.[1] His Manual of Harmonics was addressed to a lady of noble birth, at whose request Nicomachus wrote the book, which suggests that he was a respected scholar of some status.[2] He mentions his intent to write a more advanced work, and how the journeys he frequently undertakes leave him short of time.[2]The approximate dates in which he lived (c.\u2009100 AD) can only be estimated based on which other authors he refers to in his work, as well as which later mathematicians who refer to him.[1] He mentions Thrasyllus in his Manual of Harmonics, and his Introduction to Arithmetic was apparently translated into Latin in the mid 2nd century by Apuleius,[2]while he makes no mention at all of either Theon of Smyrna's work on arithmetic or Ptolemy's work on music, implying that they were either later contemporaries of lived in the time after he did.[1]/nHistorians consider Nicomachus a Neopythagorean based on his tendency to view numbers as having mystical properties rather than their mathematical properties,[3][4] citing an extensive amount of Pythagorean literature in his work, including works by Philolaus, Archytas, and Androcydes.[1] He writes extensively on numbers, especially on the significance of prime numbers and perfect numbers and argues that arithmetic is ontologically prior to the other mathematical sciences (music, geometry, and astronomy), and is their cause. Nicomachus distinguishes between the wholly conceptual immaterial number, which he regards as the 'divine number', and the numbers which measure material things, the 'scientific' number.[2]  Nicomachus provided one of the earliest Greco-Roman multiplication tables; the oldest extant Greek multiplication table is found on a wax tablet dated to the 1st century AD (now found in the British Museum).[5]/nAlthough Nicomachus is considered a Pythagorean, John M. Dillon says that Nicomachus's philosophy \"fits comfortably within the spectrum of contemporary Platonism.\"[6] In his work on arithmetic, Nicomachus quotes from Plato's Timaeus[7] to make a distinction between the intelligible world of Forms and the sensible world, however, he also makes more Pythagorean distinctions, such as between Odd and even numbers.[6] Unlike many other Neopythagoreans, such as Moderatus of Gades, Nicomachus makes no attempt to distinguish between the Demiurge, who acts on the material world, and The One which serves as the supreme first principle.[6] For Nicomachus, God as the supreme first principle is both the demiurge and the Intellect (nous), which Nicomachus also equates to being the monad, the potentiality from which all actualities are created.[6]/nTwo of Nicomachus' works, the Introduction to Arithmetic and the Manual of Harmonics are extant in a complete form, and two others, a work on Theology of Arithmetic and a Life of Pythagoras survive in fragments, epitomes, and summaries by later authors.[1] The Theology of Arithmetic (Ancient Greek: \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1 \u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1fc6\u03c2), on the Pythagorean mystical properties of numbers in two books is mentioned by Photius. There is an extant work sometimes attributed to Iamblichus under this title written two centuries later which contains a great deal of material thought to have been copied or paraphrased from Nicomachus' work. Nicomachus's Life of Pythagoras was one of the main sources used by Porphyry and Iamblichus, for their (extant) Lives of Pythagoras.[1] An Introduction to Geometry, referred to by Nicomachus himself in the Introduction to Arithmetic,[8] has not survived.[1] Among his known lost work is another larger work on music, promised by Nicomachus himself, and apparently[citation needed] referred to by Eutocius in his comment on the sphere and cylinder of Archimedes./nIntroduction to Arithmetic (Greek: \u1f08\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c3\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03ae, Arithmetike eisagoge) is the only extant work on mathematics by Nicomachus. The work contains both philosophical prose and basic mathematical ideas. Nicomachus refers to Plato quite often, and writes that philosophy can only be possible if one knows enough about mathematics. Nicomachus also describes how natural numbers and basic mathematical ideas are eternal and unchanging, and in an abstract realm. It consists of two books, twenty-three and twenty-nine chapters, respectively./nHowever Introduction of Arithmetic does contain quite elementary errors which show that Nicomachus chose not to give proofs of his results because he did not in general have such proofs. Many of the results were known by Nicomachus to be true since they appeared with proofs in Euclid's Elements, although in a geometrical formulation. Sometimes Nicomachus states a result which is simply false and then illustrates it with an example that happens to have the properties described in the result. We can deduce from this that some of the results are merely guesses based on the evidence of the numerical examples.[citation needed]/nBoethius' De institutione arithmetica is in large part a Latin translation of this work./nManuale Harmonicum (\u1f18\u03b3\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f01\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u1fc6\u03c2, Encheiridion Harmonikes) is the first important music theory treatise since the time of Aristoxenus and Euclid.  It provides the earliest surviving record of the legend of Pythagoras's epiphany outside of a smithy that pitch is determined by numeric ratios.  Nicomachus also gives the first in-depth account of the relationship between music and the ordering of the universe via the \"music of the spheres.\"  Nicomachus's discussion of the governance of the ear and voice in understanding music unites Aristoxenian and Pythagorean concerns, normally regarded as antitheses.[9]  In the midst of theoretical discussions, Nicomachus also describes the instruments of his time, also providing a valuable resource.  In addition to the Manual, ten extracts survive from what appear to have originally been a more substantial work on music./nThe Introduction to Arithmetic of Nicomachus was a standard textbook in Neoplatonic schools, and commentaries on it were written by Iamblichus (3rd century) and John Philoponus (6th century).[1]/nThe Arithmetic (in Latin: De Institutione Arithmetica) of Boethius was a Latin paraphrase and a partial translation of the Introduction to Arithmetic.[10] The Manual of Harmonics also became the basis of the Boethius' Latin treatise titled De institutione musica.[11]/nThe work of Boethius on arithmetic and music was a core part of the Quadrivium liberal arts and had a great diffusion during the Middle Ages.[12]/nAt the end of Chapter 20 of his Introduction to Arithmetic, Nicomachus points out that if one writes a list of the odd numbers, the first is the cube of 1, the sum of the next two is the cube of 2, the sum of the next three is the cube of 3, and so on. He does not go further than this, but from this it follows that the sum of the first n cubes equals the sum of the first \n\n\n\nn\n(\nn\n+\n1\n)\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n(n+1)/2}\n\n odd numbers, that is, the odd numbers from 1 to \n\n\n\nn\n(\nn\n+\n1\n)\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n(n+1)-1}\n\n. The average of these numbers is obviously \n\n\n\nn\n(\nn\n+\n1\n)\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n(n+1)/2}\n\n, and there are \n\n\n\nn\n(\nn\n+\n1\n)\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n(n+1)/2}\n\n of them, so their sum is \n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nn\n(\nn\n+\n1\n)\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\bigl (}n(n+1)/2{\\bigr )}^{2}.}\n\n Many early mathematicians have studied and provided proofs of Nicomachus's theorem.[13]", "67236927": "Robert Edwin Zink (died July 30, 2020 West Lafayette, Indiana) was Professor emeritus of Mathematics at Purdue University.[1]/nZink is a native of Minneapolis.

His mathematical contributions are connected chiefly with the theory of functions, which today is called complex analysis. He founded the most important mathematical periodical Acta Mathematica and was its editor for 40 years. He took great trouble and procured  Sofia Kovalevskaya a position of full professor of mathematics in Stockholm University. Also Mittag-Leffler was responsible for inducing the Nobel committee to recognize and award Marie Curie as an equal contributor to the discoveries \u2018on the radiation phenomena\u2019 along with her husband Pierre Curie./nAfter World War I, Mittag-Leffler gave his estate in Djursholm and its remarkable library of books on mathematics to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; it became the foundation of the modern Mittag-Leffler Institute./nMittag-Leffler was born in Stockholm and became the first son of the school teacher John Olof Leffler and Gustava Wilhelmina, n\u00e9e Mittag. Soon after Gustav\u2019s birth his father was promoted to a school principal. The family lived in the school building then and their address was simply \u2018Katarina Schoolhouse\u2019. Only a few years later they managed to purchase their own house. Soon, three Gustav\u2019s siblings were born: Anna-Maria, Frits, and Arthur. Anna-Maria grew into a famous writer, Frits became a linguist, and Arthur became a civil engineer. As all children recalled, Olof and Gustava held an open and hospitable house, they often were visited by mutual friends. As an adult, Gustav claimed that a significant part of his early education he received at home by listening to their guests. For all his life, he also remembered his maternal grandparents with great affection. He used to stay in their F\u00e5gel\u00e5s house every summer. As a tribute to his maternal relatives, at the age of 20 Gustav added his mother's maiden name to his paternal surname.[1][2]/nIn 1855, Gustav went to Klara Elementary School in Stockholm. The school was respectable and upper class families brought their children there. Still, in recollections of August Strindberg it was \u2018a setting straight out of Dickens novels\u2019 with severe fights between students, frequent beatings by teachers, and very strict atmosphere.[3] Still, Gustav showed himself a gifted student. In Klara school Gustav met Viktor Rydberg.[4]/nMittag-Leffler entered the Uppsala University when G\u00f6ran Dillner was in charge of its mathematical research and teaching. Under his guidance Mittag-Leffler wrote and defended a thesis, which was described by his biographers as \u2018less than remarkable\u2019. Nevertheless, he completed his PhD in 1872 and became docent at the university the same year.[2]/nIn 1873, Mittag-Leffler won a Byzantine stipend. Given by a Swede donor who lived in Constantinople, it had a condition: that a receiver must study abroad for three years. So inThus, in the years 1873-1876 Mittag-Leffler was studying in the three most important XIXth century centers of mathematics: University of Paris,  Humboldt University of Berlin, and University of G\u00f6ttingen. In October 1873, he arrived to Paris, where soon acquainted Darboux, Joseph Liouville, Charles Auguste Briot, Jean Claude Bouquet, and several other prominent mathematicians of the time. In Paris, Mittag-Leffler attended lectures of Charles Hermite on elliptic functions, but found Hermite\u2019s style old-fashioned and the lectures very difficult to follow. In Spring 1874, he moved to Berlin and started visiting Karl Weierstrass's lectures on elliptic functions. Weierstrass influenced Mittag-Leffler greatly, his views and methods shaped all future courses of Mittag-Leffler's studies.[2][5] During this period he edited a weekly newspaper, Ny Illustrerad Tidning, which was based in Stockholm.[6]/nIn 1877, Mittag-Leffler became the professor of mathematics in Helsingfors as successor to Lorenz Lindel\u00f6f. The thesis Mittag-Leffler applied for the position was described by peers as brilliant, even by Ernst Leonard Lindel\u00f6f, one of 4 other applicants.[7][2] In Helsingfors Mittag-Leffler lectured on elliptic functions and basic analysis. He had many students who wrote theses under his guidance, some even moved after him in Sweden later.[8]/nIn 1881, he resigned from Helsingfors University and on June 11 became the first professor of mathematics at the newly founded University College of Stockholm (the later Stockholm University).[7][2]/nIn 1882, he married Signe Lindfors.[7] She came from an exceptionally wealthy and distinguished Finland Swede family.[8] Her father Jacob Julius af Lindfors was a major-general and led a successful business, while her mother Maria Emilia Borgstr\u00f6m was from one of the richest merchant family in Helsingfors.[9]/nIn 1889, Mittag-Leffler purchased two land lots about 0.5 hectare each in Djursholm. Gradually, he bought several more and by the early 1890s became the biggest landlord in Midg\u00e5rd. By April 1891, he built a family house. Three leading architects of that time collaborated in the project \u2014 Rudolf Arborelius, Carl Westman, and Ferdinand Boberg.[10] Mittag-Leffler's house soon became famous for its hospitality, and many prominent mathematicians from different countries visited Djursholm. In its remarkable library that even had volumes from the XVIth century, all guests were welcomed to work. Mittag-Leffler himself worked there editing Acta Mathematica. Thus, Djursholm estate became a hub of mathematics research.[11]/nBy 1899, Mittag-Leffler was already a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (1883), the Finnish Society of Sciences and Letters (1878, later honorary member), the Royal Swedish Society of Sciences in Uppsala, the Royal Physiographic Society in Lund (1906) and about 30 foreign learned societies, including the Royal Society of London (1896) and Acad\u00e9mie des sciences in Paris (1900). He held honorary doctorates from the University of Oxford and several other universities.[12][13][14]/nMittag-Leffler was a convinced advocate of women's rights. He served as an intermediary to help Sofia Kovalevskaya become a full professor of mathematics in Stockholm. With his help, in 1884 she became the first woman anywhere in the world to hold that position.[15] After her death he put a lot of effort into preventing her scientific image from being distorted in times when her accomplishments were under constant attacks of skeptics, critics and mere detractors.[16] As a member of the Nobel Prize Committee in 1903, Mittag-Leffler was responsible for inducing the committee to award the prize for Physics jointly to Marie and Pierre Curie, instead of just Pierre.[17]/nIn 1882, Mittag-Leffler founded the mathematical journal Acta Mathematica. His idea was to create an international publication that would publish works written by the best scientists of the world. He also cherished the thought that mathematics was the science of pure thought and the first between sciences. In the early 1880s, through his former teacher Charles Hermite Mittag-Leffler acquainted Paul Appell, Emile Picard, and Henri Poincar\u00e9. Mittag-Leffler offered Poincar\u00e9 editorial help and fast publication of his recent manuscript on Fuchsian groups. This work became the basis of the first issue. Mittag-Leffler spent his honeymoon traveling through Europe persuading mathematicians to join the project, and managed to secure a constant flow of good articles. The journal required substantial funding, it was obtained with the help of King Oscar, and partly paid for with the fortune of Mittag-Leffler's wife Signe. On December 12, 1882, king Oscar as the first subscriber received the very first copy of Acta Mathematica. After only a few years the publication became self-supporting. Very soon it became the most prestigious of all mathematical research journals.[18][5][19]/nMittag-Leffler retired in 1911, but for more than 15 years he continued working on Acta Mathematica. He went into business and started investing in such enterprises as F. & G. Beijer Publishing Company, Alby factories, etc. Earlier, he had become associates with Henrik Palme and with the time obtained several posts and positions in his insurance and financial institutions.[20] But after the World War I Mittag-Leffler lost most of his fortune, it became virtually impossible for him to run the estate. In 1916 he turned his Djursholm estate into a national trust. That was the beginning of the Mittag-Leffler Institute.[7][21]/nThe Djursholm estate and its contents were donated to the Academy of Sciences and became the Mittag-Leffler Institute.

He also focused extensively on ethics, theory of action  and philosophy of mind./nHe was the founder of the Scottish School of Common Sense and played an integral role in the Scottish Enlightenment. In 1783 he was a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. A contemporary of David Hume, Reid was also \"Hume's earliest and fiercest critic\".[7]/nReid was born in the manse at Strachan, Aberdeenshire, on 26 April 1710,[6] the son of Lewis Reid (1676\u20131762) and his wife Margaret Gregory, first cousin to James Gregory. He was educated at Kincardine Parish School then the O'Neil Grammar School in Kincardine.[8]/nHe went to the University of Aberdeen in 1723 and graduated MA in 1726. He was licensed to preach by the Church of Scotland in 1731 when he came of age. He began his career as a minister of the Church of Scotland but ceased to be a minister when he was given a professorship at King's College, Aberdeen, in 1752. He obtained his doctorate and wrote An Inquiry Into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense (published in 1764). He and his colleagues founded the 'Aberdeen Philosophical Society, popularly known as the 'Wise Club' (a literary-philosophical association).[9] Shortly after the publication of his first book, he was given the prestigious Professorship of Moral Philosophy at the University of Glasgow when he was called to replace Adam Smith. He resigned from this position in 1781, after which he prepared his university lectures for publication in two books: Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man (1785) and Essays on the Active Powers of the Human Mind (1788). However, in 1787 he is still listed as \"Professor of Moral Philosophy\" at the university, but his classes were being taught by Archibald Arthur.[10]/nIn 1740 Thomas Reid married his cousin Elizabeth, daughter of the London physician George Reid. His wife and \"numerous\" children predeceased him, except for a daughter who married Patrick Carmichael.[11] Reid died of palsy, in Glasgow. He was buried at Blackfriars Church in the grounds of Glasgow College and when the university moved to Gilmorehill in the west of Glasgow, his tombstone was inserted in the main building./nReid believed that common sense (in a special philosophical sense of sensus communis) is, or at least should be, at the foundation of all philosophical inquiry.[12] He disagreed with Hume, who asserted that we can never know what an external world consists of as our knowledge is limited to the ideas in the mind, and George Berkeley, who asserted that the external world is merely ideas in the mind. By contrast, Reid claimed that the foundations upon which our sensus communis are built justify our belief that there is an external world./nIn his day and for some years into the 19th century, he was regarded as more important than Hume.[13] He advocated direct realism, or common sense realism, and argued strongly against the Theory of Ideas advocated by John Locke, Ren\u00e9 Descartes, and (in varying forms) nearly all Early Modern philosophers who came after them.  He had a great admiration for Hume and had a mutual friend send Hume an early manuscript of Reid's Inquiry.    Hume responded that the work \"is wrote in a lively entertaining manner,\" although he found \"there seems to be some Defect in Method\", and he criticized Reid's doctrine for implying the presence of innate ideas. (pp.\u00a0256\u2013257)[14]/nReid's theory of knowledge had a strong influence on his theory of morals. He thought epistemology was an introductory part to practical ethics: When we are confirmed in our common beliefs by philosophy, all we have to do is to act according to them, because we know what is right. His moral philosophy is reminiscent of Roman stoicism in its emphasis on the agency of the subject and self-control. He often quotes Cicero, from whom he adopted the term \"sensus communis\". Reid's answer to Hume's sceptical and naturalist arguments was to enumerate a set of principles of common sense (sensus communis) which constitute the foundations of rational thought. Anyone who undertakes a philosophical argument, for example, must implicitly presuppose certain beliefs like, \"I am talking to a real person,\" and \"There is an external world whose laws do not change,\" among many other positive, substantive claims. For Reid, the belief in the truth of these principles is not rational; rather, reason itself demands these principles as prerequisites, as does the innate \"constitution\" of the human mind. It is for this reason (and possibly a mocking attitude toward Hume and Berkeley) that Reid sees belief in the principles of common sense as a litmus test for sanity. For example, in The Intellectual Powers of Man he states, \"For, before men can reason together, they must agree in first principles; and it is impossible to reason with a man who has no principles in common with you.\" One of the first principles he goes on to list is that \"qualities must necessarily be in something that is figured, coloured, hard or soft, that moves or resists. It is not to these qualities, but to that which is the subject of them, that we give the name body. If any man should think fit to deny that these things are qualities, or that they require any subject, I leave him to enjoy his opinion as a man who denies first principles, and is not fit to be reasoned with.\"/nReid also made positive arguments based in phenomenological insight to put forth a novel mixture of direct realism and ordinary language philosophy. In a typical passage in The Intellectual Powers of Man he asserts that when he has a conception of a centaur, the thing he conceives is an animal, and no idea is an animal; therefore, the thing he conceives is not an idea, but a centaur. This point relies both on an account of the subjective experience of conceiving an object and also on an account of what we mean when we use words. Because Reid saw his philosophy as publicly accessible knowledge, available both through introspection and through the proper understanding of how language is used, he saw it as the philosophy of common sense./nReid started out with a 'common sense' based on a direct experience of an external reality but then proceeded to explore in two directions\u2014external to the senses, and internal to human language\u2014to account more effectively for the role of rationality./nReid saw language as based on an innate capacity pre-dating human consciousness, and acting as an instrument for that consciousness.  (In Reid's terms: it is an 'artificial' instrument based on a 'natural' capacity.)    On this view, language becomes a means of examining the original form of human cognition.  Reid notes that current human language contains two distinct elements: first, the acoustic element, the sounds; and secondly the meanings\u2014which seem to have nothing to do with the sounds as such.  This state of the language, which he calls 'artificial', cannot be the primeval one, which he terms 'natural', wherein sound was not an abstract sign, but a concrete gesture or natural sign.  Reid looks to the way a child learns language, by imitating sounds, becoming aware of them long before it understands the meaning accorded to the various groups of sounds in the artificial state of contemporary adult speech.  If, says Reid, the child needed to understand immediately the conceptual content of the words it hears, it would never learn to speak at all.  Here Reid distinguishes between natural and artificial signs:/nHis external exploration, regarding the senses, led Reid to his critical distinction between 'sensation' and 'perception'. While we become aware of an object through the senses, the content of that perception is not identical with the sum total of the sensations caused in our consciousness. Thus, while we tend to focus on the object perceived, we pay no attention to the process leading from sensation to perception, which contains the knowledge of the thing as real.  How, then, do we receive the conviction of the latter's existence?    Reid's answer is, by entering into an immediate intuitive relationship with it, as a child does.  In the case of the adult, the focus is on perceiving, but with the child, it is on receiving of the sensations in their living nature.  For Reid, the perception of the child is different from the adult, and he states that man must become like a child to get past the artificial perception of the adult, which leads to Hume's view that what we perceive is an illusion.  Also, the artist provides a key to the true content of sense experience, as he engages the 'language of nature':/nThus, for Reid, common sense was based on the innate capacity of man in an earlier epoch to directly participate in nature, and one we find to some extent in the child and artist, but one that from a philosophical and scientific perspective, we must re-awaken at a higher level in the human mind above nature. Why does Reid believe that perception is the way to recognize? Well, to him \"an experience is purely subjective and purely negative. It supports the validity of a proposition, only on the fact that I find that it is impossible for me not to hold it for true, to suppose it therefore not true\" (Reid, 753). To understand this better, it is important to know that Reid divides his definition of perception into two categories: conception, and belief. \"Conception is Reid's way of saying to visualize an object, so then we can affirm or deny qualities about that thing. Reid believes that beliefs are our direct thoughts of an object, and what that object is\" (Buras, The Functions of Sensations to Reid). So, to Reid, what we see, what we visualize, what we believe of an object, is that object's true reality. Reid believes in direct objectivity, our senses guide us to what is right since we cannot trust our own thoughts. \"The worlds of common sense and of philosophy are reciprocally the converse of each other\" (Reid, 841). Reid believes that Philosophy overcomplicates the question of what is real. So, what does Common Sense actually mean then? Well, \"common sense is the senses being pulled all together to form one idea\" (Cambridge Companion to Thomas Reid, 164). Common sense (all the senses combined) is how we truly identify the reality of an object; since all that can be perceived about an object, are all pulled into one perception. How do people reach the point of accessing common sense? That's the trick, everyone is born with the ability to access common sense, that is why it is called common sense. \"The principles of common sense are common to all of humanity,\" (Nichols, Ryan, Yaffe, and Gideon, Thomas Reid)./nCommon sense works as such: If all men observe an item and believe the same qualities about that item, then the knowledge of that item is universally true.  It is common knowledge, which without explanation is held true by other people; so, what is universally seen is universally believed.  \"The real, then, is that which, sooner or later, information and reasoning would finally result in, and which is therefore independent of the vagaries of me and you.  Thus, the very origin of the conception of reality shows that this conception essentially involves the notion of a community, without definite limits, and capable of a definite increase of knowledge,\" (Reid, 155).  The combination of the same ideas, of a thing, by multiple people, is what confirms the reality of an object.  Reid also believes that the philosophers of his time exaggerated what is truly real.  Where most philosophers believe that what we see is not fully what that thing is, for example, Descartes, Reid counters this argument simply by stating that \"such a hypothesis is no more likely to be true than the common-sensical belief that the world is much the way we perceive it to be,\" (Nichols, Ryan, Yaffe, and Gideon, Thomas Reid).  Reality is what we make it out to be, nothing more./nReid also claimed that this discovery of the link between the natural sign and the thing signified was the basis of natural philosophy and science, as proposed by Bacon in his radical method of discovery of the innate laws of nature:/nIt has been claimed that Reid's reputation waned after attacks on the Scottish School of Common Sense by Immanuel Kant (although Kant, only 14 years Reid's junior, also bestowed much praise on Scottish philosophy\u2014Kant attacked the work of Reid, but admitted he had never actually read his works) and by John Stuart Mill.  But Reid's was the philosophy taught in the colleges of North America during the 19th century and was championed by Victor Cousin, a French philosopher.  Justus Buchler has shown that Reid was an important influence on the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce, who shared Reid's concern to revalue common sense and whose work links Reid to pragmatism.  To Peirce, conceptions of truth and the real involve the notion of a community without definite limits (and thus potentially self-correcting as far as needed), and capable of a definite increase of knowledge.[15]   Common sense is socially evolved, open to verification much like scientific method, and constantly evolving, as evidence, perception, and practice warrant, albeit with a slowness that Peirce came only in later years to see, at which point he owned his \"adhesion, under inevitable modification, to the opinion of...Thomas Reid, in the matter of Common Sense\".[16]   (Peirce called his version \"critical common-sensism\").  By contrast, on Reid's concept, the sensus communis is not a social evolutionary product but rather a precondition of the possibility that humans could reason with each other.  The work of Thomas Reid influenced the work of Noah Porter and James McCosh in the 19th century United States and is based upon the claim of universal principles of objective truth. Pragmatism is not the development of the work of the Scottish \"Common Sense\" School\u2014it is the negation of it.  There are clear links between the work of the Scottish Common Sense School and the work of the Oxford Realist philosophers Harold Prichard and Sir William David Ross in the 20th century./nReid's reputation has revived in the wake of the advocacy of common sense as a philosophical method or criterion by G. E. Moore early in the 20th century, and more recently because of the attention given to Reid by contemporary philosophers, in particular philosophers of religion in the school of Reformed epistemology such as William Alston,[17] Alvin Plantinga, and Nicholas Wolterstorff,[18] seeking to rebut charges that theistic belief is irrational where it has no doxastic foundations (that is, where that belief is not inferred from other adequately grounded beliefs)./nHe wrote a number of important philosophical works, including Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense (1764, Glasgow & London), Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man (1785) and Essays on the Active Powers of Man (1788). In 1844, Schopenhauer praised Reid for explaining that the perception of external objects does not result from the raw data that is received through the five senses:/nThomas Reid's excellent book, Inquiry into the Human Mind... affords us a very thorough conviction of the inadequacy of the senses for producing the objective perception of things, and also of the non-empirical origin of the intuition of space and time. Reid refutes Locke's teaching that perception is a product of the senses. This he does by a thorough and acute demonstration that the collective sensations of the senses do not bear the least resemblance to the world known through perception, and in particular by showing that Locke's five primary qualities (extension, figure, solidity, movement, number) cannot possibly be supplied to us by any sensation of the senses.../nThough known mainly for his epistemology, Reid is also noted for his views in the theory of action and the metaphysics of personal identity. Reid held an incompatibilist or libertarian notion of freedom, holding that we are capable of free actions of which we are the cause, and for which we are morally appraisable.[19] Regarding personal identity,  he rejected Locke's account that self-consciousness in the form of memory of one's experiences was the basis of a person's being identical with their self over time. Reid held that continuity of memory was neither necessary nor sufficient to make one numerically the same person at different times.[20]\nReid also argued that the operation of our mind connecting sensations with belief in an external world is accounted for only by an intentional Creator. In his natural religion lectures, Reid provides five arguments for the existence of God, focusing on two mainly, the cosmological and design. Reid loves and frequently uses Samuel Clarke's cosmological argument, which says, in short that the universe either has always been, or began to exist, so there must be a cause (or first principle) for both (Cuneo and Woudenberg 242). As everything is either necessary or contingent, an Independent being is required for contingency (Cuneo and Woudenberg 242). Reid spends even more time on his design argument, but is unclear exactly what he wanted his argument to be, as his lectures only went as far as his students needed. Though there is no perfect interpretation, Reid states that \"there are in fact the clearest marks of design and wisdom in the works of nature\" (Cuneo and Woudenberg 291) If something carries marks of design (regularity or variety of structure), there must be an intelligent being behind it (Reid EIP 66). This can't be known by experience, fitting with the casual excellence principle, but the cause can be seen in works of nature (Cuneo and Woudenberg 241)./nUntil recently the standard edition of the Inquiry and the Essays has been the sixth edition of William Hamilton (ed.), Edinburgh: Maclachlan and Stewart, 1863.

His father was an amateur doctor, and in 1594 he moved to Padua with his son so that he could study medicine, astronomy and mathematics.[1]  To support them, Marco Aurelio gave fencing lessons.  One of his students was Galileo himself, introduced by their mutual acquaintance Giacomo Alvise Cornaro.[2]/nIn Padua Capra met Simon Mayr, an astronomer who was a pupil of Tycho Brahe, with whom he studied mathematics. On 10 October 1604, together Mayr, Capra observed a new star (now known as Kepler's supernova) which had been seen for the first time by the friar Ilario Altobelli, who had written to Galileo about his important discovery.[3]/nIn three public lectures, Galileo used the discovery of the new star to challenge the ideas of the Peripatetic philosophers of Padua, who held the Aristotelian view that the sphere of the stars was unchangeable. Capra was offended by Galileo's failure to acknowledge him as the person who had discovered the star, and, encouraged by Mayr, in 1605 he published a pamphlet attacking Galileo's position, entitled Consideratione astronomica circa la nova et portentosa Stella che nell'anno 1604 a d\u00ec 10 ottobre apparse.[1]  Among his conclusions, Capra noted that in 1572 a similar new star (Tycho's supernova) had appeared in the constellation Cassiopeia.  It was significant, he argued, that the interval between the two stars' appearance was the same as the number of years in the life of Jesus Christ.  As both were situated among the fixed stars, their appearance must denote something of great significance.[4]/nGalileo did not respond to this provocation, but he scribbled marginal notes in his copy of it with terms such as \"bue\" (\"ox\") and \"coglione\" (\"balls\"), deriding him for his ignorance of both Italian and of Latin.[5] Then, concealing his identity behind the pseudonym 'Cecco di Ronchitti', he responded to Antonio Lorenzini and his pamphlet Discorso intorno alla Nuova Stella (Padua, 1605) in a caustic pamphlet entitled Dialogo de Cecco di Ronchitti da Bruzene in perpuosito de la stella Nuova, written in the ancient dialect of Padua (called \"dialetto pavano\").[6]/nCapra\u2019s second confrontation with Galileo was sufficiently serious for Galileo to decide he needed to confront it openly. In 1602 Capra and his father had asked Galileo to let them observe how his proportional compass worked \u2013 although Galileo had not invented the instrument, he had made it much easier to use and had devised new applications for it. In 1605 the Capras had borrowed a Galilean compass for a time from their friend Giacomo Alvise Cornaro, and they spent time at the workshop of Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni, the craftsman who made Galileo\u2019s instruments for him. By these means they were able to learn how the compass was made.[1]/nIn 1607 Baldassarre Capra published the tract Usus et fabrica circini cuiusdam proportionis, per quem omnia fere tum Euclidis, tum mathematicorum omnium problemata facile negotio resolvitur, which was more or less a translation into Latin of Galileo\u2019s 1606 work Le operazioni del compasso geometrico et militare. Capra dedicated the work to Cornaro and used it to claim that he had invented the proportional compass himself.[7] Galileo had successfully defended himself against a previous charge of plagiarism fought against him in 1602 by a Flemish mathematician, so he could not afford to take Capra\u2019s claims lightly. He therefore asked for the matter to be adjudicated by the rectors of the university.[1]/nDuring the hearing, Galileo was able to demonstrate not only that he had not copied Capra\u2019s work, but that Capra had copied his work, and where he had introduced original material of his own, he had introduced errors. The testimony of Galileo\u2019s friend Paolo Sarpi was crucial to the hearing, and he declared that Galileo had given him a compass as early as 1597./nIn the face of this, Capra stated that he was willing to apologise for his unfounded allegation of plagiarism by publishing a book in which he would acknowledge the offence caused to Galileo.  Galileo refused however, wanting to give the widest possible publicity to Capra's eventual condemnation.  The hearing continued and Capra's position was further weakened when he refused to demonstrate to the tribunal how the compass was used. The rectors found him guilty and ordered that all copies of his book were to be destroyed,[1] though some had already been sent outside the Republic of Venice. Galileo published their verdict in his favour, as well as a tract entitled Difesa contro alle calunnie et imposture di Baldessar Capra (Venice, 1607), which showed how Capra's accusations were false./nGalileo apparently believed that it had been Simon Mayr who had instigated Capra's false claim, and in his great work The Assayer he accused Mayr of having translated his instructions on the compass into Latin and then having them printed using Capra's name.[8] After the hearing Capra left Padua and returned to Milan where he continued to teach the use of the compass.

He was a member of Clart\u00e9, affiliated with Mot Dag.[4] He denounced communism after the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact of 1939.[1] During the martial law in Trondheim in 1942, organized by the occupying Nazi authorities, he was imprisoned at Falstad concentration camp. He was one of the first prisoners there; he had the prisoner number 53. He avoided execution unlike some others who were arrested during martial law, but he remained imprisoned from 9 March 1942 to 3 August 1943.[2][5]/nRalph Tambs Lyche was the father of solidarity activist Guri Tambs Lyche. His wife Elsa was a pioneer in maternal hygiene work.[4] He died in January 1991, at the age of 100.[1]", "64550014": "Robert F. Riley (December 22, 1935\u2013March 4, 2000[1]) was an American mathematician. He is known for his work in low-dimensional topology using computational tools and hyperbolic geometry, being one of the inspirations for William Thurston's later breakthroughs in 3-dimensional topology.[2]/nRiley earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from MIT in 1957; shortly thereafter he dropped out of the graduate program and went on to work in industry, eventually moving to Amsterdam in 1966. In 1968 he took a temporary position at the University of Southampton.[3] He defended his Ph.D. at this institution in 1980, under the nominal direction of David Singerman.[4] For the next two years he occupied a postdoctoral position in Boulder where William Thurston was employed at the time, before moving on to Binghamton University as a professor.[3]/nRiley's research was in geometric topology, especially in knot theory, where he mostly studied representations of knot groups. Early on, following work of Ralph Fox, he was interested in morphisms to finite groups.

Hobbes is best known for his 1651 book Leviathan, in which he expounds an influential formulation of social contract theory.[4] In addition to political philosophy, Hobbes contributed to a diverse array of other fields, including history, jurisprudence, geometry, theology, and ethics, as well as philosophy in general. He is considered to be one of the founders of modern political philosophy.[5][6]/nHobbes was born and raised in Malmesbury and attended the University of Oxford before graduating from the University of Cambridge in 1608. He then became a tutor to the Cavendish family. After returning to England from France in 1641, Hobbes witnessed the destruction and brutality of the English Civil War from 1642 to 1651 between Parliamentarians and Royalists, which heavily influenced his advocacy for governance by an absolute sovereign in Leviathan. Aside from social contract theory, Leviathan also popularized ideas such as the state of nature (\"war of all against all\") and laws of nature./nHis other major works include the trilogy De Cive (1642), De Corpore (1655), and De Homine (1658) as well as the posthumous work Behemoth (1681)./nThomas Hobbes was born on 5 April 1588 (Old Style), in Westport, now part of Malmesbury in Wiltshire, England. Having been born prematurely when his mother heard of the coming invasion of the Spanish Armada, Hobbes later reported that \"my mother gave birth to twins: myself and fear.\"[7] Hobbes had a brother, Edmund, about two years older, as well as a sister, Anne./nAlthough Thomas Hobbes's childhood is unknown to a large extent, as is his mother's name,[8] it is known that Hobbes's father, Thomas Sr., was the vicar of both Charlton and Westport. Hobbes's father was uneducated, according to John Aubrey, Hobbes's biographer, and he \"disesteemed learning.\"[9] Thomas Sr. was involved in a fight with the local clergy outside his church, forcing him to leave London. As a result, the family was left in the care of Thomas Sr.'s older brother, Francis, a wealthy glove manufacturer with no family of his own./nHobbes was educated at Westport church from age four, went to the Malmesbury school, and then to a private school kept by a young man named Robert Latimer, a graduate of the University of Oxford.[10] Hobbes was a good pupil, and between 1601 and 1602 he went to Magdalen Hall, the predecessor to Hertford College, Oxford, where he was taught scholastic logic and mathematics.[11][12][13] The principal, John Wilkinson, was a Puritan and had some influence on Hobbes. Before going up to Oxford, Hobbes translated Euripides' Medea from Greek into Latin verse.[9]/nAt university, Thomas Hobbes appears to have followed his own curriculum as he was little attracted by the scholastic learning.[10] Leaving Oxford, Hobbes completed his B.A. degree by incorporation at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1608.[14] He was recommended by Sir James Hussey, his master at Magdalen, as tutor to William, the son of William Cavendish,[10] Baron of Hardwick (and later Earl of Devonshire), and began a lifelong connection with that family.[15] William Cavendish was elevated to the peerage on his father's death in 1626, holding it for two years before his death in 1628. His son, also William, likewise became the 3rd Earl of Devonshire. Hobbes served as a tutor and secretary to both men. The 1st Earl's younger brother, Charles Cavendish, had two sons who were patrons of Hobbes. The elder son, William Cavendish, later 1st Duke of Newcastle, was a leading supporter of Charles I during the civil war personally financing an army for the king, having been governor to the Prince of Wales, Charles James, Duke of Cornwall. It was to this William Cavendish that Hobbes dedicated his Elements of Law.[9]/nHobbes became a companion to the younger William Cavendish and they both took part in a grand tour of Europe between 1610 and 1615. Hobbes was exposed to European scientific and critical methods during the tour, in contrast to the scholastic philosophy that he had learned in Oxford. In Venice, Hobbes made the acquaintance of Fulgenzio Micanzio, an associate of Paolo Sarpi, a Venetian scholar and statesman.[9]/nHis scholarly efforts at the time were aimed at a careful study of classic Greek and Latin authors, the outcome of which was, in 1628, his great translation of Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War,[10]  the first translation of that work into English from a Greek manuscript. It has been argued that three of the discourses in the 1620 publication known as Horae Subsecivae: Observations and Discourses also represent the work of Hobbes from this period.[16]/nAlthough he did associate with literary figures like Ben Jonson and briefly worked as Francis Bacon's amanuensis, translating several of his Essays into Latin,[9] he did not extend his efforts into philosophy until after 1629. In June 1628, his employer Cavendish, then the Earl of Devonshire, died of the plague, and his widow, the countess Christian, dismissed Hobbes.[17][18]/nHobbes soon (in 1629) found work as a tutor to Gervase Clifton, the son of Sir Gervase Clifton, 1st Baronet, mostly spent in Paris, until November 1630.[19] Thereafter, he again found work with the Cavendish family, tutoring William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire, the eldest son of his previous pupil. Over the next seven years, as well as tutoring, he expanded his own knowledge of philosophy, awakening in him curiosity over key philosophic debates. He visited Galileo Galilei in Florence while he was under house arrest upon condemnation, in 1636, and was later a regular debater in philosophic groups in Paris, held together by Marin Mersenne.[17]/nHobbes's first area of study was an interest in the physical doctrine of motion and physical momentum. Despite his interest in this phenomenon, he disdained experimental work as in physics. He went on to conceive the system of thought to the elaboration of which he would devote his life. His scheme was first to work out, in a separate treatise, a systematic doctrine of body, showing how physical phenomena were universally explicable in terms of motion, at least as motion or mechanical action was then understood. He then singled out Man from the realm of Nature and plants. Then, in another treatise, he showed what specific bodily motions were involved in the production of the peculiar phenomena of sensation, knowledge, affections and passions whereby Man came into relation with Man. Finally, he considered, in his crowning treatise, how Men were moved to enter into society, and argued how this must be regulated if people were not to fall back into \"brutishness and misery\". Thus he proposed to unite the separate phenomena of Body, Man, and the State.[17]/nHobbes came back home from Paris, in 1637, to a country riven with discontent, which disrupted him from the orderly execution of his philosophic plan.[17] However, by the end of the Short Parliament in 1640, he had written a short treatise called The Elements of Law, Natural and Politic. It was not published and only circulated as a manuscript among his acquaintances. A pirated version, however, was published about ten years later. Although it seems that much of The Elements of Law was composed before the sitting of the Short Parliament, there are polemical pieces of the work that clearly mark the influences of the rising political crisis. Nevertheless, many (though not all) elements of Hobbes's political thought were unchanged between The Elements of Law and Leviathan, which demonstrates that the events of the English Civil War had little effect on his contractarian methodology. However, the arguments in Leviathan were modified from The Elements of Law when it came to the necessity of consent in creating political obligation: Hobbes wrote in The Elements of Law that Patrimonial kingdoms were not necessarily formed by the consent of the governed, while in Leviathan he argued that they were. This was perhaps a reflection either of Hobbes's thoughts about the engagement controversy or of his reaction to treatises published by Patriarchalists, such as Sir Robert Filmer, between 1640 and 1651.[citation needed]/nWhen in November 1640 the Long Parliament succeeded the Short, Hobbes felt that he was in disfavour due to the circulation of his treatise and fled to Paris. He did not return for 11 years. In Paris, he rejoined the coterie around Mersenne and wrote a critique of the Meditations on First Philosophy of Descartes, which was printed as third among the sets of \"Objections\" appended, with \"Replies\" from Descartes, in 1641. A different set of remarks on other works by Descartes succeeded only in ending all correspondence between the two.[20]/nHobbes also extended his own works in a way, working on the third section, De Cive, which was finished in November 1641. Although it was initially only circulated privately, it was well received, and included lines of argumentation that were repeated a decade later in Leviathan. He then returned to hard work on the first two sections of his work and published little except a short treatise on optics (Tractatus opticus), included in the collection of scientific tracts published by Mersenne as Cogitata physico-mathematica in 1644. He built a good reputation in philosophic circles and in 1645 was chosen with Descartes, Gilles de Roberval and others to referee the controversy between John Pell and Longomontanus over the problem of squaring the circle.[20]/nThe English Civil War began in 1642, and when the royalist cause began to decline in mid-1644, many royalists came to Paris and were known to Hobbes.[20] This revitalised Hobbes's political interests, and the De Cive was republished and more widely distributed. The printing began in 1646 by Samuel de Sorbiere through the Elsevier press in Amsterdam with a new preface and some new notes in reply to objections.[20]/nIn 1647, Hobbes took up a position as mathematical instructor to the young Charles, Prince of Wales, who had come to Paris from Jersey around July. This engagement lasted until 1648 when Charles went to Holland.[20]/nThe company of the exiled royalists led Hobbes to produce Leviathan, which set forth his theory of civil government in relation to the political crisis resulting from the war. Hobbes compared the State to a monster (leviathan) composed of men, created under pressure of human needs and dissolved by civil strife due to human passions. The work closed with a general \"Review and Conclusion\", in response to the war, which answered the question: Does a subject have the right to change allegiance when a former sovereign's power to protect is irrevocably lost?[20]/nDuring the years of composing Leviathan, Hobbes remained in or near Paris. In 1647, he suffered a near-fatal illness that disabled him for six months.[20] On recovering, he resumed his literary task and completed it by 1650. Meanwhile, a translation of De Cive was being produced; scholars disagree about whether it was Hobbes who translated it.[21]/nIn 1650, a pirated edition of The Elements of Law, Natural and Politic was published.[22] It was divided into two small volumes: Human Nature, or the Fundamental Elements of Policie; and De corpore politico, or the Elements of Law, Moral and Politick.[21]/nIn 1651, the translation of De Cive was published under the title Philosophical Rudiments concerning Government and Society.[23] Also, the printing of the greater work proceeded, and finally appeared in mid-1651, titled Leviathan, or the Matter, Forme, and Power of a Common Wealth, Ecclesiastical and Civil. It had a famous title-page engraving depicting a crowned giant above the waist towering above hills overlooking a landscape, holding a sword and a crozier and made up of tiny human figures. The work had immediate impact.[21] Soon, Hobbes was more lauded and decried than any other thinker of his time.[21] The first effect of its publication was to sever his link with the exiled royalists, who might well have killed him.[21] The secularist spirit of his book greatly angered both Anglicans and French Catholics.[21] Hobbes appealed to the revolutionary English government for protection and fled back to London in winter 1651.[21] After his submission to the Council of State, he was allowed to subside into private life[21] in Fetter Lane.[citation needed]/nIn 1658, Hobbes published the final section of his philosophical system, completing the scheme he had planned more than 20 years before. De Homine consisted for the most part of an elaborate theory of vision. The remainder of the treatise dealt cursorily with some of the topics more fully treated in the Human Nature and the Leviathan. In addition to publishing some controversial writings on mathematics, including disciplines like geometry, Hobbes also continued to produce philosophical works.[21]/nFrom the time of the Restoration, he acquired a new prominence; \"Hobbism\" became a byword for all that respectable society ought to denounce. The young king, Hobbes's former pupil, now Charles II, remembered Hobbes and called him to the court to grant him a pension of \u00a3100.[24]/nThe king was important in protecting Hobbes when, in 1666, the House of Commons introduced a bill against atheism and profaneness. That same year, on 17 October 1666, it was ordered that the committee to which the bill was referred \"should be empowered to receive information touching such books as tend to atheism, blasphemy and profaneness... in particular... the book of Mr. Hobbes called the Leviathan.\"[25] Hobbes was terrified at the prospect of being labelled a heretic, and proceeded to burn some of his compromising papers. At the same time, he examined the actual state of the law of heresy. The results of his investigation were first announced in three short Dialogues added as an Appendix to his Latin translation of Leviathan, published in Amsterdam in 1668. In this appendix, Hobbes aimed to show that, since the High Court of Commission had been put down, there remained no court of heresy at all to which he was amenable, and that nothing could be heresy except opposing the Nicene Creed, which, he maintained, Leviathan did not do.[26]/nThe only consequence that came of the bill was that Hobbes could never thereafter publish anything in England on subjects relating to human conduct. The 1668 edition of his works was printed in Amsterdam because he could not obtain the censor's licence for its publication in England. Other writings were not made public until after his death, including Behemoth: the History of the Causes of the Civil Wars of England and of the Counsels and Artifices by which they were carried on from the year 1640 to the year 1662. For some time, Hobbes was not even allowed to respond, whatever his enemies tried. Despite this, his reputation abroad was formidable.[26]/nHobbes spent the last four or five years of his life with his patron, William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire, at the family's Chatsworth House estate. He had been a friend of the family since 1608 when he first tutored an earlier William Cavendish.[27] After Hobbes's death, many of his manuscripts would be found at Chatsworth House.[28]/nHis final works were an autobiography in Latin verse in 1672, and a translation of four books of the Odyssey into \"rugged\" English rhymes that in 1673 led to a complete translation of both Iliad and Odyssey in 1675.[26]/nIn October 1679 Hobbes suffered a bladder disorder, and then a paralytic stroke, from which he died on 4 December 1679, aged 91,[26][29]\nat Hardwick Hall, owned by the Cavendish family.[28]/nHis last words were said to have been \"A great leap in the dark\", uttered in his final conscious moments.[30] His body was interred in St John the Baptist's Church, Ault Hucknall, in Derbyshire.[31]/nHobbes, influenced by contemporary scientific ideas, had intended for his political theory to be a quasi-geometrical system, in which the conclusions followed inevitably from the premises.[9] The main practical conclusion of Hobbes's political theory is that state or society cannot be secure unless at the disposal of an absolute sovereign. From this follows the view that no individual can hold rights of property against the sovereign, and that the sovereign may therefore take the goods of its subjects without their consent. This particular view owes its significance to it being first developed in the 1630s when Charles I had sought to raise revenues without the consent of Parliament, and therefore of his subjects.[9] Hobbes rejected one of the most famous theses of Aristotle's politics, namely that human beings are naturally suited to life in a polis and do not fully realize their natures until they exercise the role of citizen.[32] It is perhaps also important to note that Hobbes extrapolated his mechanistic understanding of nature into the social and political realm, making him a progenitor of the term 'social structure.'/nIn Leviathan, Hobbes set out his doctrine of the foundation of states and legitimate governments and creating an objective science of morality.[33] Much of the book is occupied with demonstrating the necessity of a strong central authority to avoid the evil of discord and civil war./nBeginning from a mechanistic understanding of human beings and their passions, Hobbes postulates what life would be like without government, a condition which he calls the state of nature. In that state, each person would have a right, or license, to everything in the world. This, Hobbes argues, would lead to a \"war of all against all\" (bellum omnium contra omnes). The description contains what has been called one of the best-known passages in English philosophy, which describes the natural state humankind would be in, were it not for political community:[34]/nIn such condition, there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instruments of moving, and removing, such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.[35]/nIn such states, people fear death and lack both the things necessary to commodious living, and the hope of being able to obtain them. So, in order to avoid it, people accede to a social contract and establish a civil society. According to Hobbes, society is a population and a sovereign authority, to whom all individuals in that society cede some right[36] for the sake of protection. Power exercised by this authority cannot be resisted, because the protector's sovereign power derives from individuals' surrendering their own sovereign power for protection. The individuals are thereby the authors of all decisions made by the sovereign,[37] \"he that complaineth of injury from his sovereign complaineth that whereof he himself is the author, and therefore ought not to accuse any man but himself, no nor himself of injury because to do injury to one's self is impossible\". There is no doctrine of separation of powers in Hobbes's discussion.[38][39] According to Hobbes, the sovereign must control civil, military, judicial and ecclesiastical powers, even the words.[40]/nIn 1654 a small treatise, Of Liberty and Necessity, directed at Hobbes, was published by Bishop John Bramhall.[21][41] Bramhall, a strong Arminian, had met and debated with Hobbes and afterwards wrote down his views and sent them privately to be answered in this form by Hobbes. Hobbes duly replied, but not for publication. However, a French acquaintance took a copy of the reply and published it with \"an extravagantly laudatory epistle\".[21]  Bramhall countered in 1655, when he printed everything that had passed between them (under the title of A Defence of the True Liberty of Human Actions from Antecedent or Extrinsic Necessity).[21]/nIn 1656, Hobbes was ready with The Questions concerning Liberty, Necessity and Chance, in which he replied \"with astonishing force\"[21] to the bishop. As perhaps the first clear exposition of the psychological doctrine of determinism, Hobbes's own two pieces were important in the history of the free-will controversy. The bishop returned to the charge in 1658 with Castigations of Mr Hobbes's Animadversions, and also included a bulky appendix entitled The Catching of Leviathan the Great Whale.[42]/nHobbes opposed the existing academic arrangements, and assailed the system of the original universities in Leviathan. He went on to publish De Corpore, which contained not only tendentious views on mathematics but also an erroneous proof of the squaring of the circle. This all led mathematicians to target him for polemics and sparked John Wallis to become one of his most persistent opponents. From 1655, the publishing date of De Corpore, Hobbes and Wallis continued name-calling and bickering for nearly a quarter of a  century, with Hobbes failing to admit his error to the end of his life.[43] After years of debate, the spat over proving the squaring of the circle gained such notoriety that it has become one of the most infamous feuds in mathematical history./nThe religious opinions of Hobbes remain controversial as many positions have been attributed to him and range from atheism to Orthodox Christianity. In the Elements of Law, Hobbes provided a cosmological argument for the existence of God, saying that God is \"the first cause of all causes\".[44]/nHobbes was accused of atheism by several contemporaries; Bramhall accused him of teachings that could lead to atheism. This was an important accusation, and Hobbes himself wrote, in his answer to Bramhall's The Catching of Leviathan, that \"atheism, impiety, and the like are words of the greatest defamation possible\".[45] Hobbes always defended himself from such accusations.[46] In more recent times also, much has been made of his religious views by scholars such as Richard Tuck and J. G. A. Pocock, but there is still widespread disagreement about the exact significance of Hobbes's unusual views on religion./nAs Martinich has pointed out, in Hobbes's time the term \"atheist\" was often applied to people who believed in God but not in divine providence, or to people who believed in God but also maintained other beliefs that were considered to be inconsistent with such belief or judged incompatible with orthodox Christianity. He says that this \"sort of discrepancy has led to many errors in determining who was an atheist in the early modern period\".[47] In this extended early modern sense of atheism, Hobbes did take positions that strongly disagreed with church teachings of his time. For example, he argued repeatedly that there are no incorporeal substances, and that all things, including human thoughts, and even God, heaven, and hell are corporeal, matter in motion. He argued that \"though Scripture acknowledge spirits, yet doth it nowhere say, that they are incorporeal, meaning thereby without dimensions and quantity\".[48] (In this view, Hobbes claimed to be following Tertullian.) Like John Locke, he also stated that true revelation can never disagree with human reason and experience,[49] although he also argued that people should accept revelation and its interpretations for the reason that they should accept the commands of their sovereign, in order to avoid war./nWhile in Venice on tour, Hobbes made the acquaintance of Fulgenzio Micanzio, a close associate of Paolo Sarpi, who had written against the pretensions of the papacy to temporal power in response to the Interdict of Pope Paul V against Venice, which refused to recognise papal prerogatives. James I had invited both men to England in 1612. Micanzio and Sarpi had argued that God willed human nature, and that human nature indicated the autonomy of the state in temporal affairs. When he returned to England in 1615, William Cavendish maintained correspondence with Micanzio and Sarpi, and Hobbes translated the latter's letters from Italian, which were circulated among the Duke's circle.[9]/nEditions compiled by William Molesworth./nPp.\u00a0193\u2013210 in Elements, Appendix I./npp.\u00a0211\u2013226 in Elements, Appendix II./nPp.\u00a0147\u2013228 in Rivista critica di storia della filosofia 18/npp.\u00a010\u201327 in Hobbes's Thucydides/npp.\u00a010\u201327 in Hobbes's Thucydides/nPhD dissertation/npp.\u00a0729\u2013738 in Rivista di storia della filosofia 43/nClarendon Edition, vol. 6\u20137/nAttribution:", "29914241": "Robert J.

For example, he conjectured[2] that if A and B are integers with 0 \u2264 B < A, there are infinitely many n for which p(An+B) is even and infinitely many n for which p(An+B) is odd. Ken Ono[3] showed that the even case is always true and that if there is one number n such that p(An+B) is odd, then there are infinitely many such numbers n.

After high school, Bers studied at the University of Zurich for a year, but had to return to Riga again because of the difficulty of transferring money from Latvia in the international financial crisis of the time. He continued his studies at the University of Riga, where he became active in socialist politics, including giving political speeches and working for an underground newspaper.

After first moving to the US, while working for YIVO, he researched Yiddish mathematics textbooks rather than pure mathematics.[6]/nAt Brown, he began working on problems of fluid dynamics, and in particular on the two-dimensional subsonic flows associated with cross-sections of airfoils. At this time, he began his work with Abe Gelbart on what would eventually develop into the theory of pseudoanalytic functions. Through the 1940s and 1950s he continued to develop this theory, and to use it to study the planar elliptic partial differential equations associated with subsonic flows. Another of his major results in this time concerned the singularities of the partial differential equations defining minimal surfaces. Bers proved an extension of Riemann's theorem on removable singularities, showing that any isolated singularity of a pencil of minimal surfaces can be removed; he spoke on this result at the 1950 International Congress of Mathematicians and published it in Annals of Mathematics.[6]/nLater, beginning with his visit to the Institute for Advanced Study, Bers \"began\na ten-year odyssey that took him from pseudoanalytic functions and elliptic equations to quasiconformal mappings, Teichm\u00fcller theory, and\nKleinian groups\".[6] With Lars Ahlfors, he solved the \"moduli problem\", of finding a holomorphic parameterization of the Teichm\u00fcller space, each point of which represents a compact Riemann surface of a given genus. During this period he also coined the popular phrasing of a question on eigenvalues of planar domains, \"Can one hear the shape of a drum?\", used as an article title by Mark Kac in 1966 and finally answered negatively in 1992 by an academic descendant of Bers. In the late 1950s, by way of adding a coda to his earlier work, Bers wrote several major retrospectives of flows, pseudoanalytic functions, fixed point methods, Riemann surface theory prior to his work on moduli, and the theory of several complex variables. In 1958, he presented his work on Riemann surfaces in a second talk at the International Congress of Mathematicians.[6]/nBers' work on the parameterization of Teichm\u00fcller space led him in the 1960s to consider the boundary of the parameterized space, whose points corresponded to new types of Kleinian groups, eventually to be called singly-degenerate Kleinian groups. He applied Eichler cohomology, previously developed for applications in number theory and the theory of Lie groups, to Kleinian groups. He proved the Bers area inequality, an area bound for hyperbolic surfaces that became a two-dimensional precursor to William Thurston's work on geometrization of 3-manifolds and 3-manifold volume, and in this period Bers himself also studied the continuous symmetries of hyperbolic 3-space.[6]/nQuasi-Fuchsian groups may be mapped to a pair of Riemann surfaces by taking the quotient by the group of one of the two connected components of the complement of the group's limit set; fixing the image of one of these two maps leads to a subset of the space of Kleinian groups called a Bers slice. In 1970, Bers conjectured that the singly degenerate Kleinian surface groups can be found on the boundary of a Bers slice; this statement, known as the Bers density conjecture, was finally proven by Namazi, Souto, and Ohshika in 2010 and 2011.[9][10] The Bers compactification of Teichm\u00fcller space also dates to this period./nOver the course of his career, Bers advised approximately 50 doctoral students,[11] among them Enrico Arbarello, Irwin Kra, Linda Keen, Murray H. Protter, and Lesley Sibner.[5] Approximately a third of Bers' doctoral students were women, a high proportion for mathematics.[8][12] Having felt neglected by his own advisor,[3] Bers met regularly for meals with his students and former students,[6] maintained a keen interest in their personal lives as well as their professional accomplishments,[12] and kept up a friendly competition with Lars Ahlfors over who could bring to larger number of academic descendants to mathematical gatherings.[2]/nAs a small child with his mother in Saint Petersburg, Bers had cheered the Russian Revolution and the rise of the Soviet Union, but by the late 1930s he had become disillusioned with communism after the assassination of Sergey Kirov and Stalin's ensuing purges.[3] His son, Victor Bers, later said that \"His experiences in Europe motivated his activism in the human rights movement,\"[4] and Bers himself attributed his interest in human rights to the legacy of Menshevik leader Julius Martov.[3] He founded the Committee on Human Rights of the National Academy of Sciences,[4][13] and beginning in the 1970s worked to allow the emigration of dissident Soviet mathematicians including Yuri Shikhanovich, Leonid Plyushch, Valentin Turchin, and David and Gregory Chudnovsky.[4] Within the U.S., he also opposed the American involvement in the Vietnam War and southeast Asia,[2][6] and the maintenance of the U.S. nuclear arsenal during the Cold War.[2]/nIn 1961, Bers was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,[14] and in 1965 he became a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.[6] He joined the National Academy of Sciences in 1964.[6] He was a member of  the Finnish Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.  He received the AMS Leroy P. Steele Prize for mathematical exposition in 1975 for his paper \"Uniformization, moduli, and Kleinian groups\". In 1986, the New York Academy of Sciences gave him their Human Rights Award.[4] In the early 1980s, the Association for Women in Mathematics held a symposium to honor Bers' accomplishments in mentoring women mathematicians.[3]", "55080104": "Frank Edward Dennie (March 30, 1885 \u2013 January 13, 1952), also known as Fred Dennie, was an American college football player and coach, athletics administrator, and mathematics professor.

The three-dimensional quartic is foundational for modern research in birational geometry.[1]/nIn the 1970s Iskovskikh applied the method of maximal singularities to prove important theorems on birational maps of several classes of Fano threefolds. The theorems provided general principles for birational classification in dimension three. Iskovskikh and Manin's research made three-dimensional birational geometry into a systematic theory.[1]/nIskovskikh gave a biregular classification of Fano 3-folds. His results on Fano 3-folds lead to the success of Mori's theory in the 1980s. Iskovskikh obtained a complete classification of minimal rational surfaces over arbitrary fields and studied the groups of birational automorphisms for all classes of birational surfaces over any perfect field.

Ford Award.[7]/nGuy was born 30 September 1916 in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England, to Adeline Augusta Tanner and William Alexander Charles Guy. Both of his parents were teachers, rising to the rank of headmistress and headmaster, respectively. He attended Warwick School for Boys, the third oldest school in Britain, but was not enthusiastic about most of the curriculum. He was good at sports and excelled in mathematics. At the age of 17 he read Dickson's History of the Theory of Numbers. He said it was better than \"the whole works of Shakespeare\", solidifying his lifelong interest in mathematics.[8]/nIn 1935 Guy entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, as a result of winning several scholarships. To win the most important of these he had to travel to Cambridge and write exams for two days. His interest in games began while at Cambridge where he became an avid composer of chess problems.[9] In 1938, he was graduated with a second-class honours degree; he would later state that his failure to get a first may have been related to his obsession with chess.[10] Although his parents strongly advised against it, Guy decided to become a teacher and got a teaching diploma at the University of Birmingham. He met his future wife, Nancy Louise Thirian, through her brother Michael, who was a fellow scholarship winner at Gonville and Caius. He and Louise shared loves of mountain climbing and dancing. They married in December 1940./nIn November 1942, Guy received an emergency commission in the Meteorological Branch of the Royal Air Force, with the rank of flight lieutenant.[11] He was posted to Reykjavik, and later to Bermuda, as a meteorologist.  He tried to get permission for Louise to join him but was refused. While in Iceland, he did some glacier travel, skiing, and mountain climbing, marking the beginning of another long love affair, this one with snow and ice.[12] When Guy returned to England after the war, he went back to teaching, this time at Stockport Grammar School, but stayed only two years. In 1947 the family moved to London, where he got a job teaching mathematics at Goldsmiths' College.[13]/nIn 1951 he moved to Singapore, where he taught at the University of Malaya until 1962. He then spent a few years at the Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi, India.

This gave me encouragement, and I began to think of myself as possibly being something of a research mathematician, which I hadn't done before.\"[26] Eventually he wrote four papers with Erd\u0151s, giving him an Erd\u0151s number of 1,[27] and solved one of Erd\u0151s' problems.[28] Guy was intrigued by unsolved problems and wrote two books devoted to them.[29][30] Many number theorists got their start trying to solve problems from Guy's book Unsolved problems in number theory.[31]/nGuy described himself as an amateur mathematician,[32] although his work was widely respected by professionals.[33] In a career that spans eight decades he wrote or co-authored more than a dozen books and collaborated with some of the most important mathematicians of the twentieth century.[34] Paul Erd\u0151s, John H.

In a series of papers in 1940 with Raymond Marrot, he provided a mathematical formulation of the relativistic kinetic theory.[18][19][20] He later worked on gravitational radiation,[21] spinor fields,[22] and propagators[23] on curved space-time, obtaining results which preluded his later works on quantisation and deformation./nAmong his contributions to Riemannian geometry, in 1944 he formulated a conjecture about locally harmonic 4-manifolds,[24] which has been later generalised and is now known as Lichnerowicz conjecture. In 1952 he showed, together with Armand Borel, that the restricted holonomy group of a Riemannian manifold is compact.[25][26] He proved the now standard equivalence of the various definitions of K\u00e4hler manifold and he worked on the classification of compact homogeneous K\u00e4hler spaces.[27][28] In 1958 he was one of the first to introduce a relation between the spectrum of the Laplacian and the curvature of the metric.[29] After formalising Cartan\u2019s and Weyl\u2019s theory of spinors in a rigorous framework, he proved in 1963 the Lichnerowicz formula relating the Dirac operator and the Laplace\u2013Beltrami operator acting on spinors.[30]/nIn the 1970s his interests turned to symplectic geometry and dynamical systems, with many pioneering papers which, in the next decades, would give rise to the modern field of Poisson geometry. Indeed, starting\u00a0in\u00a01974, together with Mosh\u00e9 Flato and Daniel Sternheimer, Lichnerowicz formulated\u00a0the\u00a0first definitions\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0Poisson manifold in terms of a bivector, the counterpart of a (symplectic) differential 2-form.[31][32][33] He showed later that the same philosophy can be used to generalise contact structures to Jacobi manifolds.[34] In a 1976 paper one can already find the classical formula \n\n\n\n[\nd\nf\n,\nd\ng\n]\n=\nd\n{\nf\n,\ng\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle [df,dg]=d\\{f,g\\}}\n\n for the Lie algebroid bracket of \n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\u2217\n\n\nM\n\n\n{\\displaystyle T^{*}M}\n\n on exact 1-forms via the Poisson bracket of functions.[35] In 1977 Lichnerowicz introduced the\u00a0operator defining what\u00a0is\u00a0now\u00a0called\u00a0Poisson cohomology.[36] His 1978 papers on\u00a0the deformation of the algebra of smooth functions on a Poisson manifold established the new research area of deformation quantisation.[37][38]/nLichnerowicz published more than 350 papers and supervised 24 Ph.D. students.[6] A collection of scientific contributions from several of his collaborators was published in his honour in occasion of his 60th birthday.[39] In 1982 a personal selection of his own works was published by Hermann.[40]/nWhile pursuing an active research career, Lichnerowicz had a deep interest in mathematics education and pedagogy. From 1963 to 1966 he was President of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction of the International Mathematical Union.[41][42] In 1967 the French government created the Lichnerowicz Commission made up of 18 teachers of mathematics. The commission recommended a curriculum based on set theory and logic with an early introduction to mathematical structures. It recommended introduction to complex numbers for seniors in high school, less computation-based instruction, and more development from premises (the axiomatic approach). These reforms have been called New Math and have been repeated internationally.[43] However, the reforms faced stern backlash from parents, who had trouble helping their children with homework,[44] teachers, who found themselves ill-prepared and ill-equipped,[45] and scholars from various disciplines, who deemed the New Math to be simply unsuitable and impractical.[46][47][48] Lichnerowicz resigned and the commission was disbanded in 1973.[45] Nevertheless, the influence of the proposed reforms in mathematics education had endured, as the Soviet mathematician Vladimir Arnold recalled in a 1995 interview.[49]", "30962889": "Joseph Lawson Hodges Jr. (April 10, 1922 \u2013 March 1, 2000) was a statistician.

Furthermore, the reviewer notes that this mathematics has \"connections to optics, kinematics and architecture as well as (more recently) geology, tomography, computer vision and face-recognition.\"\nThese applications follow from the theories of contact, umbilical points, ridges, germs, and cusps. Porteous has suggestions for readers wanting to know more about singularity theory. The underlying theme is the study of critical points of appropriate distance-squared functions.

He had a reputation for being an absentee bishop and was sharply reprimanded on that account by William King, Archbishop of Dublin, who wrote that the enemies of the church were led by his conduct to conclude that \"bishops are not necessary, since they can so long be spared\", and pleaded with him to \"think of coming home as soon as possible\"./nHe occasionally contributed to the proceedings of the Royal Society, of which he was a member.

In addition, Neyman won the Israeli under 20 chess championship in 1966./nNeyman has made numerous contributions to game theory, including to stochastic games, the Shapley value, and repeated games./nTogether with Jean-Francois Mertens, he proved the existence of the uniform value of zero-sum undiscounted stochastic games.[15] This work is considered one of the most important works in the theory of stochastic games, solving a problem that had been open for over 20 years.[16]  Together with Elon Kohlberg, he applied operator techniques to study convergence properties of the discounted and finite stage values.[17] Recently, he has pioneered a model of stochastic games in continuous time and derived uniform equilibrium existence results.[18] He also co-edited, together with Sylvain Sorin, a comprehensive\ncollection of works in the field of stochastic games.[19]/nNeyman has made many contributions to the theory of repeated games.  One idea that appears, in different contexts, in some of his papers, is that the model of an infinitely repeated game serves also as a powerful paradigm for a long finitely repeated game.  A related insight appears in a 1999 paper, where he showed that in a long finitely repeated game, an exponentially small deviation from common knowledge of the number of repetitions is enough to dramatically alter the equilibrium analysis, producing a folk-theorem-like result.[20]/nNeyman is one of the pioneers and a most notable leader of the study of repeated games under complexity constraints. In his seminal paper[21] he showed that bounded memory can justify cooperation in a finitely repeated prisoner's dilemma game. His paper was followed by many others who started working on bounded memory games. Most notable was Neyman's M.Sc. student Elchanan Ben-Porath who was the first to shed light on the strategic value of bounded complexity.[22]/nThe two main models of bounded complexity, automaton size and recall capacity, continued to pose intriguing open problems in the following decades. A major breakthrough was achieved when Neyman and his Ph.D. student Daijiro Okada proposed a new approach to these problems, based on information theoretic techniques, introducing the notion of strategic entropy.[23][24] His students continued to employ Neyman's entropy technique to achieve a better understanding of repeated games under complexity constraints. Neyman's information theoretic approach opened new research areas beyond bounded complexity. A classic example is the communication game he introduced jointly with Olivier Gossner and Penelope Hernandez.[25]/nNeyman has made numerous fundamental contributions to the theory of the value.  In a \"remarkable tour-de-force of combinatorial\nreasoning\",[26] he proved the existence of an asymptotic value for weighted majority games.[27]  The proof was facilitated by his fundamental contribution to renewal theory.[28] In subsequent work Neyman proved that many of the assumptions made in these works can be relaxed, while showing that others are essential./nNeyman proved the diagonality of continuous values,[29] which had many implications on further developments of the theory. Together with Pradeep Dubey and Robert James Weber he studied the theory of semivalues, and separately demonstrated its importance in political economy.[30][31]  Together with Pradeep Dubey [32][33] he characterized the well-known phenomenon of value correspondence, a fundamental notion in economics, originating already in Edgeworth's work and Adam Smith before him. In loose terms, it essentially states that in a large economy consisting of many economically insignificant agents, the core of the economy coincides with the perfectly competitive outcomes, which in the case of differentiable preferences is a unique element that is the Aumann\u2013Shapley value. Another major contribution of Neyman was the introduction of the Neyman value,[34] a far-reaching generalization of the Aumann\u2013Shapley value to the case of non-differentiable vector measure games./nNeyman has made contributions to other fields of mathematics, usually motivated by problems in game theory. Among these contributions are a renewal theorem for sampling without replacement (mentioned above as applied to the theory of the value), contributions to embeddings of Lp spaces,[35] contributions to the theory of vector measures,[36] and to the theory of non-expansive mappings.[37]/nNeyman previously served (2005\u20138) as director at Tradus (previously named QXL).[38] He also held a directorship (2004\u20135) at Gilat Satellite Networks.[39] In 1999, Neyman\nco-founded Bidorbuy, the first online auction company to operate in India and in South Africa, and serves as the chairman of the board.[40] Since 2013, he has held a directorship at the Israeli bank Mizrahi-Tefahot.[41]", "31487239": "James Bryce LLD FRSE (22 oct 1806, in Killaig, Coleraine, Londonderry \u2013 11 July 1877, in Inverfarigaig, Scotland) was an Irish mathematician, naturalist and geologist./nHe was the third son of Rev James Bryce (1767\u20131857), and of Catherine Annan of Auchtermuchty in Fife, and was born at Killaig, near Coleraine, on 23 October 1806. \nHe was educated first by his father and eldest brother, the Rev.

In 1883 he published a dissertation on quadrics in projective space and was named an assistant to professors in algebra and analytic geometry. In 1885 he also assisted in descriptive geometry. He began to instruct in projective geometry, as a stand-in for Giuseppe Bruno, from 1885 to 1888. Then for 36 years, he had the chair in higher geometry following D'Ovidio. Segre and Giuseppe Peano made Turin known in geometry, and their complementary instruction has been noted as follows:[2]/n\"in the mid 1880s, these two very young researchers, Segre and Peano, both of them only just past twenty and both working at the University of Turin, were developing very advanced points of view on fundamental geometrical issues. Although their positions were quite different from one another, they were in some way more complementary than opposed. So it must come as no surprise that Turin was the cradle of some of the most interesting studies on such issues.\"/nThe Erlangen program of Felix Klein appealed early on to Segre, and he became a promulgator. First, in 1885 he published an article on conics in the plane where he demonstrated how group theory facilitated the study. As Hawkins says (page 252) \"the totality of all conics in the plane is identified with P5(C)\". The group of its projectivities is then the group that permutes conics. About Segre, Hawkins writes[3]/n\"shortly after he assumed the chair of projective geometry in Turin in 1888, he decided it would be worthwhile to have an Italian translation of the Erlangen Program because he felt its contents were not well enough known among young Italian geometers. ... Segre convinced one of the students at Turin, Gino Fano, to make a translation which was published in Annali di Matematica Pura ed Applicata in 1889. Fano's translation thus became the first of many translations of the Erlangen Program.\"/nThe inspiring Geometrie der Lage (1847) of Karl Georg Christian von Staudt provided Segre with another project. He encouraged Mario Pieri to make a translation, Geometria di Posizione (1889), while Segre composed a biographical sketch of von Staudt that was included in the publication./nSegre also expanded algebraic geometry by consideration of multicomplex numbers, in particular the bicomplex numbers. Segre's 1892 contribution to Mathematische Annalen shows him extending the work of William Rowan Hamilton and William Kingdon Clifford on biquaternions. But Segre was unaware of an earlier study of tessarines that had anticipated his bicomplex numbers./nIn English, the best-known work of Segre is an inspirational essay meant for Italian students, translated by J.W. Young in 1904.[4] It provides guidance and encouragement to young people studying mathematics./nIn a 1926 memorial article, H.F. Baker called Segre the \"father of\" the Italian school of algebraic geometry./nThe 1912 article \"Higher-dimensional Spaces\" (Mehrdimensionale R\u00e4ume[5]) for Enzyklop\u00e4die der mathematischen Wissenschaften spanned 200 pages.[6] In admiration, Baker (1926) wrote and Coolidge (1927) reiterated: For completeness of detail, breadth of view, and generous recognition of the work of a host of other writers, this must remain for many years a monument of the comprehensiveness of the man.", "292142": "Sarvadaman D.

On an evolutionary scale, the diversification of demographic strategies raises many questions. Only modelling can therefore shed light on population dynamics, both at the ecological and evolutionary level. It is one of the main international actors in the development of population dynamics models.[5]/nFirst, it contributed to the launch of matrix models of population dynamics, producing formal sensitivity results and original stochastic generalizations,[6] and applying these models to various vertebrates.

First, it was necessary to shift their focus from a focus on numbers to estimating individual flows and then to introduce ideas from generalized linear models, thus making it possible to analyze probabilities of survival according to age, gender or environment.[7] His work, by bridging the gap between capture-recapture models and analysis of variance, has contributed to a real revolution, with a wide range of applications in evolutionary ecology and conservation biology. In recent years, he has been involved in the development of various types of models in which individuals move between several states, for example, to study dispersion and reproductive achievement.[8] At the same time, he developed a long-term program on the For\u00e9zian population of Black-legged Kittiwake Chroicocephalus ridibundus, which highlighted the importance of dispersal behaviour in colonial birds in the face of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the environments./nHe has also relaunched theoretical and practical studies in the context of the biology of exploited populations.[9] The integration of the dynamic and statistical models he developed, both by himself and in the team he created in Montpellier, has enabled him to shed light on the conservation and management of the populations subject to sampling:/nBoth personally and through the team he created, but also through the development of close collaborations with the French vertebrate population biology teams (LBBE Lyon, Paris VI, MNHN, Chiz\u00e9, Strasbourg, Tour du Valat), he and various colleagues have contributed to the creation of a \"French school\" for the dynamics and biology of vertebrate populations with high international visibility.[10]/nThe development and distribution of flexible and user-friendly software (Biomeco; U-CARE; SURGE, M-SURGE, E-SURGE) to support his team's research production have greatly contributed to this visibility.[11]/nAs in his research administration activities, he was able to focus on \"social utility\" and collective construction in his international research and collaborations \u2013 there was a full choice in his generation.

While Haros was involved many computation projects at the Bureau du Cadastre including the computation of de Prony\u2019s tables of logarithms and the preparation of the French ephemeris, Connaissance des Temps, he is best known for a small table he prepared to convert fractions to their decimal equivalents./nHaros\u2019 conversion table appeared in a tract, Instruction Abr\u00e9g\u00e9e sur les nouvelles Mesures qui dovient \u00e9tre introduites dans toute r\u00e9publique, au vend\u00e9miaire an 10; avec tables de rapports et reductions, that was presented to the Mathematics Section of the Institut de France and subsequently abstracted in Journal de l'\u00c9cole Polytechnique under the title \"Tables pour \u00e9valuer une fraction ordinaire avec autant de decimals qu\u2019on voudra; et pour trouver la fraction ordinaire la plus simple, et qui approche sensiblement d\u2019une fraction d\u00e9cimale.\"/nIn preparing his table, Haros needed to create the list of all 3,003 irreducible (vulgar) fractions with denominators less than 100.  In order to make sure he got them all he harnessed an algorithm elucidated by Nicolas Chuquet some one-hundred and fifty years earlier.  Chuquet called it his \"r\u00e8gle des nombres moyens\". Today, we call it the mediant. The mediant is the fraction between two fractions a/c and b/d whose numerator is the sum of the numerators, a+b, and whose denominator is the sum of the denominators, c+d. That is, the mediant of the fractions a/c and b/d is the fraction (a+b)/(c+d)./nIn his paper Haros demonstrated that the mediant is always irreducible and, more importantly for this purposes, if one starts with the sequence of fractions/nand just keeps applying the rule, only keeping the result if the denominator is less than one-hundred, then they generate all 3,003./nRoughly fifteen years later in England, Henry Goodwyn set out to create a much more ambitious version of Haros\u2019 table.  In particular, Goodwyn wanted to tabulate the decimal values for all irreducible fractions with denominators less than or equal to 1,024.  There are 318,963 such fractions.  As a warm up and a test of the commercial market for such a table in 1816 he published for private circulation The First Centenary of a Series of Concise and Useful Tables of all the Complete Decimal Quotients, which can arise from dividing a unit, or any whole Number less than each Divisor by all Integers from 1 to 1024./nJohn Farey observed the mediant property in this table and mused in a letter to The Philosophical Magazine and Journal as follows:/nAugustin Cauchy read Farey\u2019s letter and published a paper \"D\u00e9monstration d\u2019un Th\u00e9or\u00e8me Curieux sur les Nombres\" reproving Haros\u2019 results without acknowledgement.  In his paper Cauchy referred to the mediant as \"a remarkable property of ordinary fractions observed by M. J.

Thales was one of the Seven Sages, founding figures of Ancient Greece, and credited with the saying \"know thyself\" which was inscribed on the Temple of Apollo at Delphi./nMany regard him as the first philosopher in the Greek tradition, breaking from the prior use of mythology to explain the world and instead using natural philosophy. He is thus otherwise credited as the first to have engaged in mathematics, science, and deductive reasoning.[1]/nThe first philosophers followed him in explaining all of nature as based on the existence of a single ultimate substance. Thales theorized that this single substance was water. Thales thought the Earth floated in water./nIn mathematics, Thales is the namesake of Thales's theorem, and the intercept theorem can also be known as Thales's theorem. Thales was said to have calculated the heights of the pyramids and the distance of ships from the shore. In science, Thales was an astronomer who reportedly predicted the weather and a solar eclipse. He was also credited with discovering the position of the constellation Ursa Major as well as the timings of the solstices and equinoxes. Thales was also an engineer; credited with diverting the Halys River.[1]/nThe main source concerning the details of Thales's life and career is the doxographer Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, in his third century AD work Lives and Opinions of the Eminent Philosophers.[2] While it is all we have, Diogenes wrote some eight centuries after Thales's death and his sources often contained \"unreliable or even fabricated information.\"[3][a] It is known Thales was from Miletus, a mercantile city settled at the mouth of the Maeander river./nThe dates of Thales's life are not exactly known, but are roughly established by a few datable events mentioned in the sources.  According to the historian Herodotus, writing in the 5th century BC, Thales predicted a solar eclipse in 585 BC.[5]  Assuming one's acme occurred at the age of 40, the chronicle of Apollodorus of Athens, written during the 2nd century BC, therefore placed Thales's birth about the year 625 BC.[6][7]/nWhile the probability is that Thales was as Greek as most Milesians,[8] Herodotus described Thales as \"a Phoenician by remote descent\".[9] Diogenes La\u00ebrtius references Herodotus, Duris, and Democritus, who all agree \"that Thales was the son of Examyas and Cleobulina, and belonged to the Thelidae who are Phoenicians and amongst the noblest descendants of Cadmus and Agenor\" who had been banished from Phoenicia and that Thales was enrolled as a citizen in Miletus along with Neleus.[10][11]/nHowever, Friedrich Nietzsche and others interpret this quote as meaning only that his ancestors were seafaring Cadmeians from Boeotia.[12][13] It is also possible that he was of mixed ancestry, given his father had a Carian name and his mother had a Greek name.[13][14][15] Diogenes La\u00ebrtius seems to also reference an alternative account: \"Most writers, however, represent him as a genuine Milesian and of a distinguished family\".[16] Encyclopedia Britannica (1952) concluded that Thales was most likely a native Milesian of noble birth and that he was certainly a Greek.[14]/nDiogenes continues, by delivering more conflicting reports: one that Thales married and either fathered a son (Cybisthus or Cybisthon) or adopted his nephew of the same name; the second that he never married, telling his mother as a young man that it was too early to marry, and as an older man that it was too late.[b] Plutarch had earlier told this version: Solon visited Thales and asked him why he remained single; Thales answered that he did not like the idea of having to worry about children. Nevertheless, several years later, anxious for family, he adopted his nephew Cybisthus.[18]/nThe culture of Archaic Greece was heavily influenced by those of the Levant and Mesopotamia.[19] It is said Thales was engaged in trade and visited either Egypt or Babylonia.[20] However, there is no strong evidence that Thales ever visited countries in the Near East, and the issue is disputed among scholars.[21] Visits to such places were a commonplace attribution to various philosophers by later writers, especially when these writers tried to explain the origin of their mathematical knowledge, such as with Thales or Pythagoras or Eudoxus.[22][1]/nSeveral ancient authors assume that Thales, at one point in his life, visited Egypt, where he learned about geometry.[23] It is considered possible that Thales visited Egypt, since Miletus had a permanent colony there (namely Naucratis). It is also said Thales had close contacts with the priests of Thebes who instructed him, or even that he instructed them in geometry.[24][25] It is also possible Thales knew about Egypt from accounts of others, without actually visiting it.[26]/nAside from Egypt, the other mathematically advanced, ancient civilization before the Greeks was Babylonia, another commonplace attribution of travel for a mathematically-minded philosopher.[27] At least one ancient historian, Josephus, claims Thales visited Babylonia./nHistorians Roger L. Cooke and B.L. Van der Waerden come down on the side of Babylonian mathematics influencing the Greeks, citing the use of e. g. the sexagesimal system (or base 60).[27] Cooke notes \"This relation, however, is controversial.\"[27] Others historians, such as D. R. Dicks, take issue with the idea of Babylonian influence on Greek mathematics. For until around the time of Hipparchus (c. 190\u2013120\u00a0BC) their sexagesimal system was unknown.[28]/nHerodotus wrote the Greeks learnt the gnomon from the Babylonians. Thales's follower Anaximander is credited with introducing the gnomon to the Greeks.[29]  Herodotus also wrote that the practice of dividing the day into 12 parts, and the polos, came to the Greeks from the Babylonians.[c] Yet this too is disputed, for example by historian L. Zhmud, who points out the gnomon was known to both Egyptians and Babylonians, the division of the day into twelve parts (and by analogy the year) was known to the Egyptians already in the 2nd millennium BC, and the idea of the  polos was not used outside of Greece at this time.[31]/nThales is recognized as one of the Seven Sages of Greece, semi-legendary wise statesman and founding figures of Ancient Greece. While which seven one chooses may change, the seven has a canonical four which includes Thales, Solon of Athens, Pittacus of Mytilene, and Bias of Priene. Diogenes La\u00ebrtius tells us that the Seven Sages were created in the archonship of Damasius at Athens about 582\u00a0BC and that Thales was the first sage.[32][d]/nEach sage has a quote or maxim attributed to him, which was inscribed on the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. Thales has arguably the most famous of all, gnothi seauton or know thyself. According to the 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia the Suda, the proverb is both \"applied to those whose boasts exceed what they are\" and \"a warning to pay no attention to the opinion of the multitude.\"[33][e]/nDiogenes La\u00ebrtius relates several stories of an expensive, gold tripod or bowl that is to go to the most wise. In one version (that La\u00ebrtius credits to Callimachus in his Iambics) Bathycles of Arcadia states in his will that an expensive bowl \"'should be given to him who had done most good by his wisdom.' So it was given to Thales, went the round of all the sages, and came back to Thales again. And he sent it to Apollo at Didyma, with this dedication...'Thales the Milesian, son of Examyas [dedicates this] to Delphinian Apollo after twice winning the prize from all the Greeks.'\"[39]/nAccording to Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, Thales gained fame as a counselor when he advised the Milesians not to engage in a symmachia, a \"fighting together\", with the Lydians. This has sometimes been interpreted as an alliance.[40]/nCroesus was defeated before the city of Sardis by Cyrus the Great, who subsequently spared Miletus because it had taken no action. Cyrus was so impressed by Croesus\u2019 wisdom and his connection with the sages that he spared him and took his advice on various matters.[citation needed] The Ionian cities should be demoi, or \"districts\"./nHe counselled them to establish a single seat of government, and pointed out Teos as the fittest place for it; \"for that,\" he said, \"was the centre of Ionia. Their other cities might still continue to enjoy their own laws, just as if they were independent states.\"[41]/nMiletus, however, received favorable terms from Cyrus. The others remained in an Ionian League of twelve cities (excluding Miletus), and were subjugated by the Persians.[citation needed]/nEarly Greeks, and other civilizations before them, often invoked idiosyncratic explanations of natural phenomena with reference to the will of anthropomorphic gods and heroes. Instead, Thales aimed to explain natural phenomena via rational hypotheses that referenced natural processes themselves.[42] Logos rather than mythos. Many, most notably Aristotle, regard him as the first philosopher in the Greek tradition.[43][44] Rather than theologoi or mythologoi, Aristotle referred to the first philosophers as physiologoi, or natural philosophers, and Thales as the first among them.  Also, while the other Seven Sages were strictly law-givers and statesmen and not speculative philosophers, Plutarch noted \"it would seem that Thales was the only wise man of the time who carried his speculations beyond the realm of the practical.\"[45]/nThales's most famous idea was his philosophical and cosmological thesis that all is water, which comes down to us through a passage from Aristotle's Metaphysics.[43] In the work, Aristotle reported Thales's theory that the arche or originating principle of nature was a single material substance: water. Aristotle then proceeded to proffer a number of conjectures based on his own observations to lend some credence to why Thales may have advanced this idea (though Aristotle did not hold it himself)./nWhile Aristotle's conjecture on why Thales held water as the originating principle of matter is his own thinking, his statement that Thales held it as water is generally accepted as genuinely originating with Thales. Writing centuries later, Diogenes La\u00ebrtius also states that Thales taught \"Water constituted (\u1f51\u03c0\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c3\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf, 'stood under') the principle of all things.\"[46][f]/nAccording to Aristotle:[43]/nThat from which is everything that exists and from which it first becomes and into which it is rendered at last, its substance remaining under it, but transforming in qualities, that they say is the element and principle of things that are. \u2026For it is necessary that there be some nature (\u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2), either one or more than one, from which become the other things of the object being saved... [The first philosophers] do not all agree as to the number and the nature of these principles. Thales the founder of this type of philosophy says that it is water./nAristotle further adds:/nPresumably he derived this assumption from seeing that the nutriment of everything is moist, and that heat itself is generated from moisture and depends upon it for its existence (and that from which a thing is generated is always its first principle). He derived his assumption from this; and also from the fact that the seeds of everything have a moist nature, whereas water is the first principle of the nature of moist things.\"[48][g]/nThe 1870 book Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology noted:[44]/nIn his dogma that water is the origin of things, that is, that it is that out of which every thing arises, and into which every thing resolves itself, Thales may have followed Orphic cosmogonies, while, unlike them, he sought to establish the truth of the assertion. Hence, Aristotle, immediately after he has called him the originator of philosophy brings forward the reasons which Thales was believed to have adduced in confirmation of that assertion; for that no written development of it, or indeed any book by Thales, was extant, is proved by the expressions which Aristotle uses when he brings forward the doctrines and proofs of the Milesian. (p. 1016)/nMost agree that Thales's stamp on thought is the unity of substance. Not merely the empirical claim that all is water, but the deeper philosophical claim that all is one.  For example, Friedrich Nietzsche, in his Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks, wrote:[49]/nGreek philosophy seems to begin with an absurd notion, with the proposition that water is the primal origin and the womb of all things. Is it really necessary for us to take serious notice of this proposition? It is, and for three reasons. First, because it tells us something about the primal origin of all things; second, because it does so in language devoid of image or fable, and finally, because contained in it, if only embryonically, is the thought, \"all things are one.\"/nMegiston topos: apanta gar chorei  (\u039c\u03ad\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2\u00b7 \u1f04\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6.)/nThe greatest is space, for it holds all things./n\u2014attributed to Thales[50]/nThales was known for introducing the theoretical and practical use of geometry to Greece, and has been described as the first person in the western world to apply deductive reasoning to geometry, making him the West's \"first mathematician.\"[7][51][52] He is also credited with the West's oldest definition of number: a \"collection of units,\" \"following the Egyptian view\".[53][54]/nThe evidence for the primacy of Thales comes to us from a book by Proclus, who lived a thousand years afterward but is believed to have had a copy of Eudemus's lost book History of Geometry (4th century BC).[h] Proclus wrote that Thales was the first to visit Egypt and bring the Egyptian study of mathematics to Greece, and that Thales \"himself discovered many propositions and disclosed the underlying principles of many others to his successors, in some case his method being more general, in others more empirical.\"[52] In addition to Proclus, Hieronymus of Rhodes also cites Thales as the first Greek mathematician./nProclus attributes to Thales the discovery that a circle is bisected by its diameter, that the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal and that vertical angles are equal.[55] Two fundamental theorems of elementary geometry are customarily called Thales's theorem: one of them has to do with a triangle inscribed in a circle and having the circle's diameter as one side;[55] the other, also called the intercept theorem, is about an angle intercepted by two parallel lines, forming a pair of similar triangles./nModern scholars are skeptical that anyone in Thales's time was producing mathematical proofs to the standard of later Greek mathematics, though not enough direct evidence remains to draw firm conclusions. While Thales may have discovered some basic geometric relations and provided some justification for them, attribution to him of formal proofs is now thought to represent speculative rationalization and reconstruction by later authors, rather than concrete accomplishments of Thales himself or his contemporaries.[56]/nAccording to one author, while visiting Egypt,[23] Thales observed that when the Egyptians drew two intersecting lines, they would measure the vertical angles to make sure that they were equal.[57] Thales concluded that one could prove that all vertical angles are equal if one accepted some general notions such as: all straight angles are equal, equals added to equals are equal, and equals subtracted from equals are equal./nPamphila says that, having learnt geometry from the Egyptians, Thales was the first to inscribe in a circle a right-angled triangle, whereupon he sacrificed an ox.[52] This is sometimes cited as history's first mathematical discovery.[58] Due to the variations among testimonies, such as the story of the ox sacrifice being accredited to Pythagoras upon discovery of the Pythagorean theorem rather than Thales, some historians (such as D. R. Dicks) question whether such anecdotes have any historical worth whatsoever.[28]/nIt is believed the Babylonians knew the theorem for special cases before Thales proved it.[59][60]\nThe theorem is mentioned and proved as part of the 31st proposition in the third book of Euclid's Elements.[61]  Dante's Paradiso refers to Thales's theorem in the course of a speech.[62]/nThe story is told in Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, Pliny the Elder, and Plutarch,[52][63] sourced from Hieronymus of Rhodes, that when Thales visited Egypt,[23] he measured the height of the pyramids by their shadows at the moment when his own shadow was equal to his height.[i] According to Plutarch, it pleased the pharoah Amasis. More practically, Thales was said to have the ability to measure the distances of ships at sea./nThese stories indicate familiarity with the intercept theorem, and for this reason the 26th proposition in the first book of Euclid's Elements was attributed to Thales.[65] They also indicate that he was familiar with the Egyptian seked, or seqed, the ratio of the run to the rise of a slope (cotangent).[66][j] According to Kirk & Raven,[8] all you need for this feat is three straight sticks pinned at one end and knowledge of your altitude. One stick goes vertically into the ground. A second is made level. With the third you sight the ship and calculate the seked from the height of the stick and its distance from the point of insertion to the line of sight.[67]/nThales was also a noted astronomer credited in antiquity with describing the position of Ursa Minor, and he thought the constellation might be useful as a guide for navigation at sea. He calculated the duration of the year and the timings of the equinoxes and solstices. He is additionally attribute with calculating the position of the Pleiades.[8]/nPlutarch indicates that in his day (c. AD 100) there was an extant work, the Astronomy, composed in verse and attributed to Thales.[68] While some say he left no writings, others say that he wrote On the Solstice and On the Equinox. The Nautical Star-guide has also been attributed to him, but this was disputed even in ancient times.[8][k] No writing attributed to him has survived. Lobon of Argus asserted that the writings of Thales amounted to two hundred lines.[69]/nThales thought the Earth must be a flat disk or mound of land and dirt which is floating in an expanse of water.[70] Heraclitus Homericus states that Thales drew his conclusion from seeing moist substance turn into air, slime and earth. It seems likely that Thales viewed the land as coming from the water on which it floated and the oceans that surround it, perhaps inspired by observing silt deposits.[71]/nHe thought the stars were balls of dirt on fire.[72] He seemed to correctly gather that the moon reflects the Sun's light.[73] A crater on the Moon is named in his honor./nRather than assuming that earthquakes were the result of supernatural whims, Thales explained them by theorizing that the Earth floats on water and that earthquakes occur when the Earth is rocked by waves.[74][42] He is attributed with the first observation of the Hyades, supposed by the ancients to indicate the approach of rain when they rose with the Sun.[75] According to Seneca, Thales explained the flooding of the Nile as due to the river being beaten back by the etesian wind.[76]/nA story, with different versions, recounts how Thales achieved riches from an olive harvest by prediction of the weather. In one version, he bought all the olive presses in Miletus after predicting the weather and a good harvest for a particular year. Another version of the story has Aristotle explain that Thales had reserved presses in advance, at a discount, and could rent them out at a high price when demand peaked, following his prediction of a particularly good harvest. This first version of the story would constitute the first historically known creation and use of futures, whereas the second version would be the first historically known creation and use of options.[77]/nAristotle explains that Thales's objective in doing this was not to enrich himself but to prove to his fellow Milesians that philosophy could be useful, contrary to what they thought,[78] or alternatively, Thales had made his foray into enterprise because of a personal challenge put to him by an individual who had asked why, if Thales was an intelligent famous philosopher, he had yet to attain wealth./nAs mentioned above, according to Herodotus, Thales predicted a solar eclipse which occurred during a battle between the Lydians and the Medes.[5] Among eclipses of the era, only the eclipse of May 28, 585 BC reached totality in Anatolia where the war took place. American writer Isaac Asimov described this battle as the earliest historical event whose date is known with precision to the day, and called the prediction \"the birth of science\". As well as first mathematician and first philosopher, Thales is often given the label of the first western scientist and the \"father of science\".[79][80] but some contemporary scholars reject this interpretation.[81]/nHerodotus writes that in the sixth year of the war, the Lydians under King Alyattes and the Medes under Cyaxares were engaged in an indecisive battle when suddenly day turned into night, leading to both parties halting the fighting and negotiating a peace agreement. Herodotus also mentions that the loss of daylight had been predicted by Thales. He does not, however, mention the location of the battle.[82]/nAfterwards, on the refusal of Alyattes to give up his suppliants when Cyaxares sent to demand them of him, war broke out between the Lydians and the Medes, and continued for five years, with various success.  In the course of it the Medes gained many victories over the Lydians, and the Lydians also gained many victories over the Medes. Among their other battles there was one night engagement. As, however, the balance had not inclined in favour of either nation, another combat took place in the sixth year, in the course of which, just as the battle was growing warm, day was on a sudden changed into night. This event had been foretold by Thales, the Milesian, who forewarned the Ionians of it, fixing for it the very year in which it actually took place.  The Medes and Lydians, when they observed the change, ceased fighting, and were alike anxious to have terms of peace agreed on.[41]/nHowever, based on the list of Median kings and the duration of their reign reported elsewhere by Herodotus, Cyaxares died 10 years before the eclipse.[83][84]/nD. R. Dicks joins other historians (F. Martini, J. L. E. Dreyer, O. Neugebauer) in rejecting the historicity of the eclipse story.[28] Dicks links the story of Thales discovering the cause for a solar eclipse with Herodotus' claim that Thales discovered the cycle of the sun with relation to the solstices, and concludes \"he could not possibly have possessed this knowledge which neither the Egyptians nor the Babylonians nor his immediate successors possessed.\"[28]/nPlato, Diogenes Laertius, and Hippolytus all relay the story\u00a0that Thales was so intent upon watching the stars that he failed to watch where he was walking, and fell into a well.[85][86][l]/n\"Thales was studying the stars and gazing into the sky, when he fell into a well, and a jolly and witty Thracian servant girl made fun of him, saying that he was crazy to know about what was up in the heavens while he could not see what was in front of him beneath his feet.\"[88]/nAs well as astronomy, Thales involved himself in other practical applications of mathematics, including engineering.[89]  Another story by Herodotus is that Croesus sent his army to the Persian territory. He was stopped by the river Halys, then unbridged. Thales then got the army across the river by digging a diversion upstream so as to reduce the flow, making it possible to cross the river.[90] While Herodotus reported that most of his fellow Greeks believe that Thales did divert the river Halys to assist King Croesus' military endeavors, he himself finds it doubtful.[28] Plato praises Thales along with Anacharsis, who is credited as the originator of the potter's wheel and the anchor.[91]/nAccording to Aristotle, Thales thought \"all things are full of gods\",[8][92] i. e. lodestones had souls, because iron is attracted to them (by the force of magnetism).[93] The same applied to amber for its capacity to generate static electricity. The reasoning for such hylozoism or organicism seems to be if something moved, then it was alive, and if it was alive, then it must have a soul.[94][95]/nAs well as gods seen in the movement caused by what came to be known as magnetism and electricity, it seems Thales also had a supreme God which structured the universe:/n\"Thales\", says Cicero,[96] \"assures that water is the principle of all things; and that God is that Mind which shaped and created all things from water.\"/nAccording to Henry Fielding (1775), Diogenes La\u00ebrtius (1.35) affirmed that Thales posed \"the independent pre-existence of God from all eternity, stating \"that God was the oldest of all beings, for he existed without a previous cause even in the way of generation; that the world was the most beautiful of all things; for it was created by God.\"[97]/nNicholas Molinari has recently argued that Thales was influenced by the archaic water deity Acheloios, who was equated with water and worshipped in Miletus during Thales's life. For evidence, he points to the fact that hydor meant specifically \"fresh water,\" and also that Acheloios was seen as a shape-shifter in myth and art, so able to become anything. He also points out that the rivers of the world were seen as the \"sinews of Acheloios\" in antiquity, and this multiplicity of deities is reflected in Thales's idea that \"all things are full of gods.\"[98]/nDiogenes La\u00ebrtius quotes Apollodorus as saying that Thales died at the age of 78 during the 58th Olympiad (548\u2013545\u00a0BC) and attributes his death to heat stroke and thirst while watching the games.[99]/nAs the first philosopher and mathematician, Thales had a profound influence on other Greek thinkers and therefore on Western history.  However, due to the scarcity of sources concerning Thales and the discrepancies between the accounts given in the sources that have survived, there is a scholarly debate over the extent of the influence of Thales had and on which of the Greek philosophers and mathematicians that came after him.[m]/nThe first three philosophers in the Western tradition were all cosmologists from Miletus, and Thales was the very first, followed by Anaximander, who was followed in turn by Anaximenes. They have been dubbed the Milesian school.  According to the Suda, Thales had been the \"teacher and kineman\" of Anaximander.[101]  Rather than water, Anaximander held all was made of apeiron or the unlimited; while Anaximenes, the successor of Anaximander, perhaps more like Thales with water, held that everything was composed of air.[102]/nJohn Burnet (1892) noted[103]/nLastly, we have one admitted instance of a philosophic guild, that of the Pythagoreans. And it will be found that the hypothesis, if it is to be called by that name, of a regular organisation of scientific activity will alone explain all the facts. The development of doctrine in the hands of Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes, for instance, can only be understood as the elaboration of a single idea in a school with a continuous tradition./nAs two of the first Greek mathematicians, Thales is also considered an influence on Pythagoras. According to Iamblichus, Pythagoras \"had benefited by the instruction of Thales in many respects, but his greatest lesson had been to learn the value of saving time.\"[104] Early sources[which?] report that Pythagoras, in this story a pupil of Anaximander, visited Thales as a young man, and that Thales advised him to travel to Egypt to further his philosophical and mathematical studies./nThales was also considered the teacher of the astronomer Mandrolytus of Priene.[105] It is possible he was also the teacher of Cleostratus of Tenedos.[106]", "51737978": "Hokky Situngkir (born February 7, 1978)[2] is an Indonesian scientist who researches complexity theory at Surya University.

Two of the 1979 problems were proposed by Engel, and one in each of 1981, 1983, 1986 and 1987.[6]/nIn 1990 Engel was awarded the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany by the Minister of Education of West Germany.[2] In 1991 he was among the first three recipients of the David Hilbert Award given by the World Federation of National Mathematics Competitions (WFNMC). The award was given for an article he published in 1987 in the WFNMC Journal \"Mathematics Competitions\" that discussed creating Mathematical Olympiad Problems, covering the different aspects of the subject in detail.[7]/nEngel was the author or co-author of numerous textbooks, teaching aids and books and articles on teaching mathematics written in German and English. Some have been translated into French, Spanish and Polish.[8]/nIn his 1970 paper The Teaching of Probability in the Intermediate Grades, Engel described an activity in which students would first use a spinning device to generate a random series of numbers, then use devices to create a series where the spins were not independent, simulating a Markov process. An Australian teacher built on this to introduce students to a simple model of the weather.[9] In his 1975 Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung und Statistik (Probability and Statistics) volume 2, Engel provided a chip-moving algorithm that could be used to determine the basic descriptive qualities of an absorbing Markov chain. The algorithm depended on recurrence of the initial distribution of chips, which Engel said had been proved by L. Scheller but not published. A proof was published in 2006 by J. Laurie Snell.[10]/nIn his 1984 Elementary Mathematics from an Algorithmic Standpoint Engel had the insight that with computers and calculators widely available, students would no longer accept rote learning of algorithms that could be executed mechanically. He proposed that mathematics in schools should instead focus on the concept of the algorithm, and the syllabus should be completely revised to take an \"algorithmic standpoint\". His proposed approach would focus on construction and testing of algorithms rather than their execution.[11]/nEngel was one of the first to recognize the value of computer programming in teaching mathematics.[12] Engel's 1993 Exploring Mathematics with Your Computer, draws from number theory, probability, statistics, combinatorics, numerical algorithms and many other fields.[13] The book was primarily written for teachers.[14] The book has been criticized for failing to provide motivation before discussing topics, called \"a nice idea, not very well executed\".[15] However the book has also been called \"a collection of gems ... a rich banquet.\"[13] Another reviewer called this book \"an excellent source of ideas for computer-based activities that engage students in mathematical explorations.[14] A third reviewer said \"Those who have met examples of Arthur Engel's work will know what to expect, and this is another example of his astonishing versatility.\"[16]/nEngel's 1998 Problem-Solving Strategies has been described as the \"most complete training book available for secondary and collegiate mathematics contests ...

In other words, given three lines, we can add to them a circle such that the four, these lines and the circle, are all touched by four other circles. In the present chapter we show how, given any three circles in a plane, we can add to them another circle, which we call the Hart circle, such that the four circles are all touched by four other circles (Hart, 'Quart. J. of Math.', IV (1861), p. 260). The three original circles are in fact touched by eight other circles, as we shall prove. There are fourteen ways of choosing, from these eight, four circles which touch another circle. In six of these ways, the four circles chosen have a common orthogonal circle; and the four circles consisting of the original circles, and their Hart circle, have also a common orthogonal circle.

She was one of the first directors of studies in mathematics, and one of the earliest members of the London Mathematical Society.[3] In 1916, she was one of the first women to be elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society.[4]/nMeyer was born in Strabane, Tyrone, Ireland, to a Presbyterian minister, Theodore Jonas Meyer, and his wife Jane Ann. She had an older brother, Sir William Stevenson Meyer, who served as first high commissioner for India.[4] Meyer spent much of her childhood in Italy.  She attended the North London Collegiate School for Girls, then enrolled at Girton College, Cambridge in 1879, graduating 15th wrangler in mathematics 1882.  In 1907, she was awarded an ad eundem MA by Trinity College Dublin.[5]/nShe taught at Notting Hill High School, in London, from 1882 to 1888, and then became a resident lecturer in mathematics at Girton College, where she remained for 30 years.

A leading writer of the Victorian era, he exerted a profound influence on 19th-century art, literature, and philosophy./nBorn in Ecclefechan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, Carlyle attended the University of Edinburgh where he excelled in mathematics, inventing the Carlyle circle. After finishing the arts course, he prepared to become a minister in the Burgher Church while working as a schoolmaster. He quit these and several other endeavours before settling on literature, writing for the Edinburgh Encyclop\u00e6dia and working as a translator. He found initial success as a disseminator of German literature, then little-known to English readers, through his translations, his Life of Friedrich Schiller (1825), and his review essays for various journals. His first major work was a novel entitled Sartor Resartus (1833\u201334). After relocating to London, he became famous with his French Revolution (1837), which prompted the collection and reissue of his essays as Miscellanies. Each of his subsequent works, including On Heroes (1841), Past and Present (1843), Cromwell's Letters (1845), Latter-Day Pamphlets (1850), and History of Frederick the Great (1858\u201365), were highly regarded throughout Europe and North America. He founded the London Library, contributed significantly to the creation of the National Portrait Galleries in London and Scotland,[12] was elected Lord Rector of Edinburgh University in 1865, and received the Pour le M\u00e9rite in 1874, among other honours./nCarlyle occupied a central position in Victorian culture, being considered not only, in the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson, the \"undoubted head of English letters\",[13][14] but a \"secular prophet\". Posthumously, his reputation suffered as publications by his friend and disciple James Anthony Froude provoked controversy about Carlyle's personal life, particularly his marriage to Jane Welsh Carlyle. His reputation further declined in the 20th century, as the onsets of World War I and World War II brought forth accusations that he was a progenitor of both Prussianism and fascism. Since the 1950s, extensive scholarship in the field of Carlyle Studies has improved his standing, and he is now recognised as \"one of the enduring monuments of our literature who, quite simply, cannot be spared.\"[15]/nThomas Carlyle was born on 4 December 1795 to James (1758\u20131832) and Margaret Aitken Carlyle (1771\u20131853) in the village of Ecclefechan in Dumfriesshire in southwest Scotland. His parents were members of the Burgher secession Presbyterian church.[16] James Carlyle was a stonemason, later a farmer, who built the Arched House wherein his son was born. His maxim was that \"man was created to work, not to speculate, or feel, or dream.\"[17] Nicholas Carlisle, an English antiquary, traced his ancestry back to Margaret Bruce, sister of Robert the Bruce.[18] As a result of his disordered upbringing, James Carlyle became deeply religious in his youth, reading many books of sermons and doctrinal arguments throughout his life. He married his first wife in 1791, distant cousin Janet, who gave birth to John Carlyle and then died. He married Margaret Aitken in 1795, a poor farmer's daughter then working as a servant. They had nine children, of whom Thomas was the eldest. Margaret was pious and devout and hoped that Thomas would become a minister. She was close to her eldest son, being a \"smoking companion, counsellor and confidante\" in Carlyle's early days. She suffered a manic episode when Carlyle was a teenager, in which she became \"elated, disinhibited, over-talkative and violent.\"[19] She suffered another breakdown in 1817, which required her to be removed from her home and restrained.[20] Carlyle always spoke highly of his parents, and his character was deeply influenced by both of them.[21]/nCarlyle's early education came from his mother, who taught him reading (despite being barely literate), and his father, who taught him arithmetic.[22] He first attended \"Tom Donaldson's School\" in Ecclefechan followed by Hoddam School (c.\u20091802\u20131806), which \"then stood at the Kirk\", located at the \"Cross-roads\" midway between Ecclefechan and Hoddam Castle.[23] By age 7, Carlyle showed enough proficiency in English that he was advised to \"go into Latin\", which he did with enthusiasm; however, the schoolmaster at Hoddam did not know Latin, so he was handed over to a minister that did, with whom he made a \"rapid & sure way\".[24] He then went to Annan Academy (c.\u20091806\u20131809), where he studied rudimentary Greek, read Latin and French fluently, and learned arithmetic \"thoroughly well\".[25] Carlyle was severely bullied by his fellow students at Annan, until he \"revolted against them, and gave stroke for stroke\"; he remembered the first two years there as among the most miserable of his life.[26]/nIn November 1809 at nearly fourteen years of age, Carlyle walked one hundred miles from his home in order to attend the University of Edinburgh (c.\u20091809\u20131814), where he studied mathematics with John Leslie, science with John Playfair and moral philosophy with Thomas Brown.[28] He gravitated to mathematics and geometry and displayed great talent in those subjects, being credited with the invention of the Carlyle circle. In the University library, he read many important works of eighteenth-century and contemporary history, philosophy, and belles-lettres.[29] He began expressing religious scepticism around this time, asking his mother to her horror, \"Did God Almighty come down and make wheelbarrows in a shop?\"[30] In 1813 he completed his arts curriculum and enrolled in a theology course at Divinity Hall the following academic year. This was to be the preliminary of a ministerial career.[31]/nCarlyle began teaching at Annan Academy in June 1814.[32] He gave his first trial sermons in December 1814 and December 1815, both of which are lost.[33] By the summer of 1815 he had taken an interest in astronomy[34] and would study the astronomical theories of Pierre-Simon Laplace for several years.[35] In November 1816, he began teaching at Kirkcaldy, having left Annan. There, he made friends with Edward Irving, whose ex-pupil Margaret Gordon became Carlyle's \"first love\". In May 1817,[36] Carlyle abstained from enrolment in the theology course, news which his parents received with \"magnanimity\".[37] In the autumn of that year, he read De l'Allemagne (1813) by Germaine de Sta\u00ebl, which prompted him to seek a German teacher, with whom he learned the pronunciation.[38] In Irving's library, he read the works of David Hume and Edward Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776\u20131789); he would later recall that/nI read Gibbon, and then first clearly saw that Christianity was not true. Then came the most trying time of my life. I should either have gone mad or made an end of myself had I not fallen in with some very superior minds.[39]/nIn the summer of 1818, following a \"Tour\" with Irving through \"Peebles-Moffat moor country\", Carlyle made his first attempt at publishing, forwarding an article \"of a descriptive Tourist kind\" to \"some Magazine Editor in Edinburgh\", which was not published and is now lost.[40] In October, Carlyle resigned from his position at Kirkcaldy, and left for Edinburgh in November.[41] Shortly before his departure, he began to suffer from dyspepsia, which remained with him throughout his life.[42] He enrolled in a mineralogy class from November 1818 to April 1819, attending lectures by Robert Jameson,[43] and in January 1819 began to study German, desiring to read the mineralogical works of Abraham Gottlob Werner.[44] In February and March, he translated a piece by J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius,[45] and by September he was \"reading Goethe\".[46] In November he enrolled in \"the class of Scots law\", studying under David Hume (the advocate).[47] In December 1819 and January 1820, Carlyle made his second attempt at publishing, writing a review-article on Marc-Auguste Pictet's review of Jean-Alfred Gautier's Essai historique sur le probl\u00e8me des trois corps (1817) which went unpublished and is lost.[48] The law classes ended in March 1820 and he did not pursue the subject any further.[49]/nIn the same month, he wrote several articles for David Brewster's Edinburgh Encyclop\u00e6dia (1808\u20131830), which appeared in October. These were his first published writings.[50] In May and June, Carlyle wrote a review-article on the work of Christopher Hansteen, translated a book by Friedrich Mohs, and read Goethe's Faust.[51] By the autumn, Carlyle had also learned Italian and was reading Vittorio Alfieri, Dante Alighieri and Sismondi,[52] though German literature was still his foremost interest, having \"revealed\" to him a \"new Heaven and new Earth\".[53] In March 1821, he finished two more articles for Brewster's encyclopedia, and in April he completed a review of Joanna Baillie's Metrical Legends (1821).[54]/nIn May, Carlyle was introduced to Jane Baillie Welsh by Irving in Haddington.[55] The two began a correspondence, and Carlyle sent books to her, encouraging her intellectual pursuits; she called him \"my German Master\".[56]/nDuring this time, Carlyle struggled with what he described as \"the dismallest Lernean Hydra of problems, spiritual, temporal, eternal\".[57] Spiritual doubt, lack of success in his endeavours, and dyspepsia were all damaging his physical and mental health, for which he found relief only in \"sea-bathing\". In early July 1821,[58] \"during those 3 weeks of total sleeplessness, in which almost\" his \"one solace was that of a daily bathe on the sands between [Leith] and Portobello\", an \"incident\" occurred in Leith Walk as he \"went down\" into the water.[59] This was the beginning of Carlyle's \"Conversion\", the process by which he \"authentically took the Devil by the nose\"[60] and flung \"him behind me\".[61] It gave him courage in his battle against the \"Hydra\"; to his brother John, he wrote, \"What is there to fear, indeed?\"[62]/nCarlyle wrote several articles in July, August and September, and in November began a translation of Adrien Marie Legendre's Elements of Geometry. In January 1822, Carlyle wrote \"Goethe's Faust\" for the New Edinburgh Review, and shortly afterwards began a tutorship for the distinguished Buller family, tutoring Charles Buller and his brother Arthur William Buller until July; he would work for the family until July 1824. Carlyle completed the Legendre translation in July 1822, having prefixed his own essay \"On Proportion\", which Augustus De Morgan later called \"as good a substitute for the fifth Book of Euclid as could have been given in that space\".[64] Carlyle's translation of Goethe's Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship (1824) and Travels (1825) and his biography of Schiller (1825) brought him a decent income, which had before then eluded him, and he garnered a modest reputation. He began corresponding with Goethe and made his first trip to London in 1824, meeting with prominent writers such as Thomas Campbell, Charles Lamb, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and gaining friendships with Anna Montagu, Bryan Waller Proctor, and Henry Crabb Robinson. He also travelled to Paris in October\u2013November with Edward Strachey and Kitty Kirkpatrick, where he attended Georges Cuvier's introductory lecture on comparative anatomy, gathered information on the study of medicine, introduced himself to Legendre, was introduced by Legendre to Charles Dupin, observed Laplace and several other notables while declining offers of introduction by Dupin, and heard Fran\u00e7ois Magendie read a paper on the \"fifth pair of nerves\".[65]/nIn May 1825, Carlyle moved into a cottage farmhouse in Hoddam Hill near Ecclefechan, which his father had leased for him. Carlyle lived with his brother Alexander, who, \"with a cheap little man-servant\", worked on the farm, his mother with her one maid-servant, and his two youngest sisters, Jean and Jenny.[66] He had constant contact with the rest of his family, most of whom lived close by at Mainhill, a farm owned by his father.[67] Jane made a successful visit in September 1825. Whilst there, Carlyle wrote German Romance (1827), a collection of previously untranslated German novellas by Johann Karl August Mus\u00e4us, Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu\u00e9, Ludwig Tieck, E. T. A. Hoffmann, and Jean Paul. In Hoddam Hill, Carlyle found respite from the \"intolerable fret, noise and confusion\" that he had experienced in Edinburgh, and observed what he described as \"the finest and vastest prospect all round it I ever saw from any house\", with \"all Cumberland as in amphitheatre unmatchable\".[66] Here, he completed his \"Conversion\" which began with the Leith Walk incident. He achieved \"a grand and ever-joyful victory\", in the \"final chaining down, and trampling home, 'for good,' home into their caves forever, of all\" his \"Spiritual Dragons\".[68] By May 1826, problems with the landlord and the agreement forced the family's relocation to Scotsbrig, a farm near Ecclefechan. Later in life, he remembered the year at Hoddam Hill as \"perhaps the most triumphantly important of my life.\"[69]/nIn October 1826, Thomas and Jane Welsh were married at the Welsh family farm in Templand. Shortly after their marriage, the Carlyles moved into a modest home on Comely Bank in Edinburgh, that had been leased for them by Jane's mother. They lived there from October 1826 to May 1828. In that time, Carlyle published German Romance, began Wotton Reinfred, an autobiographical novel which he left unfinished, and published his first article for the Edinburgh Review, \"Jean Paul Friedrich Richter\" (1827). \"Richter\" was the first of many essays extolling the virtues of German authors, who were then little-known to English readers; \"State of German Literature\" was published in October.[70] In Edinburgh, Carlyle made contact with several distinguished literary figures, including Edinburgh Review editor Francis Jeffrey, John Wilson of Blackwood's Magazine, essayist Thomas De Quincey, and philosopher William Hamilton.[55] In 1827 Carlyle attempted to land the Chair of Moral Philosophy at St. Andrews without success, despite support from an array of prominent intellectuals, including Goethe.[71] He also made an unsuccessful attempt for a professorship at the University of London.[55]/nIn May 1828, the Carlyles moved to Craigenputtock, the main house of Jane's modest agricultural estate in Dumfriesshire, which they occupied until May 1834.[72] He wrote a number of essays there which earned him money and augmented his reputation, including \"Life and Writings of Werner\", \"Goethe's Helena\", \"Goethe\", \"Burns\", \"The Life of Heyne\" (each 1828), \"German Playwrights\", \"Voltaire\", \"Novalis\" (each 1829), \"Jean Paul Friedrich Richter Again\" (1830), \"Cruthers and Jonson; or The Outskirts of Life: A True Story\", \"Luther's Psalm\", and \"Schiller\" (each 1831). He began but did not complete a history of German literature, from which he drew material for essays \"The Nibelungen Lied\", \"Early German Literature\" and parts of \"Historic Survey of German Poetry\" (each 1831). He published early thoughts on the philosophy of history in \"Thoughts on History\" (1830) and wrote his first pieces of social criticism, \"Signs of the Times\" (1829) and \"Characteristics\" (1831).[73] \"Signs\" garnered the interest of Gustave d'Eichthal, a member of the Saint-Simonians, who sent Carlyle Saint-Simonian literature, including Henri de Saint-Simon's Nouveau Christianisme (1825), which Carlyle translated and wrote an introduction for.[74]/nMost notably, he wrote Sartor Resartus. Finishing the manuscript in late July 1831, Carlyle began his search for a publisher, leaving for London in early August.[75] He and his wife lived there for the winter at 4 (now 33) Ampton Street, Kings Cross, in a house built by Thomas Cubitt.[76][77][78] The death of Carlyle's father in January 1832 and his inability to attend the funeral moved him to write the first of what would become the Reminiscences, published posthumously in 1881.[79] Carlyle had not found a publisher by the time he returned to Craigenputtock in March but he had initiated important friendships with Leigh Hunt and John Stuart Mill. That year, Carlyle wrote the essays \"Goethe's Portrait\", \"Death of Goethe\", \"Goethe's Works\", \"Biography\", \"Boswell's Life of Johnson\", and \"Corn-Law Rhymes\". Three months after their return from a January to May 1833 stay in Edinburgh, the Carlyles were visited at Craigenputtock by Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emerson (and other like-minded Americans) had been deeply affected by Carlyle's essays and determined to meet him during the northern terminus of a literary pilgrimage; it was to be the start of a lifelong friendship and a famous correspondence. 1833 saw the publication of the essays \"Diderot\" and \"Count Cagliostro\"; in the latter, Carlyle introduced the idea of \"Captains of Industry\".[80]/nIn June 1834, the Carlyles moved into 5 Cheyne Row, Chelsea, which became their home for the remainder of their respective lives. Residence in London wrought a large expansion of Carlyle's social circle. He became acquainted with scores of leading writers, novelists, artists, radicals, men of science, Church of England clergymen, and political figures. Two of his most important friendships were with Lord and Lady Ashburton; though Carlyle's warm affection for the latter would eventually strain his marriage, the Ashburtons helped to broaden his social horizons, giving him access to circles of intelligence, political influence, and power.[81]/nCarlyle eventually decided to publish Sartor serially in Fraser's Magazine, with the instalments appearing between November 1833 and August 1834. Despite early recognition from Emerson, Mill and others, it was generally received poorly, if noticed at all. In 1834, Carlyle applied unsuccessfully for the astronomy professorship at the Edinburgh observatory.[82] That autumn, he arranged for the publication of a history of the French Revolution and set about researching and writing it shortly thereafter. Having completed the first volume after five months of writing, he lent the manuscript to Mill, who had been supplying him with materials for his research. One evening in March 1835, Mill arrived at Carlyle's door appearing \"unresponsive, pale, the very picture of despair\". He had come to tell Carlyle that the manuscript was destroyed. It had been \"left out\", and Mill's housemaid took it for wastepaper, leaving only \"some four tattered leaves\". Carlyle was sympathetic: \"I can be angry with no one; for they that were concerned in it have a far deeper sorrow than mine: it is purely the hand of Providence\". The next day, Mill offered Carlyle \u00a3200 (equivalent to \u00a321,000 in 2019),[83] of which he would only accept \u00a3100. He began the volume anew shortly afterwards. Despite an initial struggle, he was not deterred, feeling like \"a runner that tho' tripped down, will not lie there, but rise and run again.\"[84][85] By September, the volume was rewritten. That year, he wrote a eulogy for his friend, \"Death of Edward Irving\".[86]/nIn April 1836, with the intercession of Emerson, Sartor Resartus was first published in book form in Boston, soon selling out its initial run of five hundred copies.[87][88] Carlyle's three-volume history of the French Revolution was completed in January 1837 and sent to the press.[89] Contemporaneously, the essay \"Memoirs of Mirabeau\" was published,[90] as was \"The Diamond Necklace\" in January and February,[91] and \"Parliamentary History of the French Revolution\" in April.[92] In need of further financial security, Carlyle began a series of lectures on German literature in May, delivered extemporaneously in Willis' Rooms. The Spectator reported that the first lecture was given \"to a very crowded and yet a select audience of both sexes.\" Carlyle recalled being \"wasted and fretted to a thread, my tongue ... dry as charcoal: the people were there, I was obliged to stumble in, and start. Ach Gott!\"[93] Despite his inexperience as a lecturer and deficiency \"in the mere mechanism of oratory,\" reviews were positive and the series proved profitable for him.[94]/nDuring Carlyle's lecture series, The French Revolution: A History was officially published. It marked his career breakthrough. At the end of the year, Carlyle reported to Karl August Varnhagen von Ense that his earlier efforts to popularise German literature were beginning to produce results, and expressed his satisfaction: \"Deutschland will reclaim her great Colony; we shall become more Deutsch, that is to say more English, at same time.\"[95] The French Revolution fostered the republication of Sartor Resartus in London in 1838 as well as a collection of his earlier writings in the form of the Critical and Miscellaneous Essays, facilitated in Boston with the aid of Emerson. Carlyle presented his second lecture series in April and June 1838 on the history of literature at the Marylebone Institution in Portman Square. The Examiner reported that at the end of the second lecture, \"Mr. Carlyle was heartily greeted with applause.\"[96] Carlyle felt that they \"went on better and better, and grew at last, or threatened to grow, quite a flaming affair.\"[97] He published two essays in 1838, \"Sir Walter Scott\", being a review of John Gibson Lockhart's biography, and \"Varnhagen von Ense's Memoirs\". In April 1839, Carlyle published \"Petition on the Copyright Bill\".[98] A third series of lectures was given in May on the revolutions of modern Europe, which the Examiner reviewed positively, noting after the third lecture that \"Mr. Carlyle's audiences appear to increase in number every time.\"[99] Carlyle wrote to his mother that the lectures were met \"with very kind acceptance from people more distinguished than ever; yet still with a feeling that I was far from the right lecturing point yet.\"[100] In July, he published \"On the Sinking of the Vengeur\"[101] and in December he published Chartism, a pamphlet in which he addressed the movement of the same name and raised the Condition-of-England question.[102]/nIn May 1840, Carlyle gave his fourth and final set of lectures, which were published in 1841 as On Heroes, Hero-Worship, & the Heroic in History. Carlyle wrote to his brother John afterwards, \"The Lecturing business went of [sic] with sufficient \u00e9clat; the Course was generally judged, and I rather join therein myself, to be the bad best I have yet given.\"[104] In the 1840 edition of the Essays, Carlyle published \"Fractions\", a collection of poems written from 1823 to 1833.[105] Later that year, he declined a proposal for a professorship of history at Edinburgh.[106] Carlyle was the principal founder of the London Library in 1841.[107] He had become frustrated by the facilities available at the British Museum Library, where he was often unable to find a seat (obliging him to perch on ladders), where he complained that the enforced close confinement with his fellow readers gave him a \"museum headache\", where the books were unavailable for loan, and where he found the library's collections of pamphlets and other material relating to the French Revolution and English Civil Wars inadequately catalogued. In particular, he developed an antipathy to the Keeper of Printed Books, Anthony Panizzi (despite the fact that Panizzi had allowed him many privileges not granted to other readers), and criticised him in a footnote to an article published in the Westminster Review as the \"respectable Sub-Librarian\".[108] Carlyle's eventual solution, with the support of a number of influential friends, was to call for the establishment of a private subscription library from which books could be borrowed.[109]/nCarlyle had chosen Oliver Cromwell as the subject for a book in 1840 and struggled to find what form it would take. In the interim, he wrote Past and Present (1843) and the articles \"Baillie the Covenanter\" (1841), \"Dr. Francia\" (1843), and \"An Election to the Long Parliament\" (1844). Carlyle declined an offer for professorship from St. Andrews in 1844. The first edition of Oliver Cromwell's Letters and Speeches: with Elucidations was published in 1845; it was a popular success and did much to revise Cromwell's standing in Britain.[81]/nCarlyle visited Ireland in 1846 with Charles Gavan Duffy as a companion and guide, and wrote a series of brief articles on the Irish question in 1848. These were \"Ireland and the British Chief Governor\", \"Irish Regiments (of the New \u00c6ra)\", and \"The Repeal of the Union\", each of which offered solutions to Ireland's problems and argued to preserve England's connection with Ireland.[110] Carlyle wrote an article titled \"Ireland and Sir Robert Peel\" (signed \"C.\") published in April 1849 in The Spectator in response to two speeches given by Peel wherein he made many of the same proposals which Carlyle had earlier suggested; he called the speeches \"like a prophecy of better things, inexpressibly cheering.\"[111] In May, he published \"Indian Meal\", in which he advanced maize as a remedy to the Great Famine as well as the worries of \"disconsolate Malthusians\".[112] He visited Ireland again with Duffy later that year while recording his impressions in his letters and a series of memoranda, published as Reminiscences of My Irish Journey in 1849 after his death; Duffy would publish his own memoir of their travels, Conversations with Carlyle.[113]/nCarlyle's travels in Ireland deeply affected his views on society, as did the Revolutions of 1848. While embracing the latter as necessary in order to cleanse society of various forms of anarchy and misgovernment, he denounced their democratic undercurrent and insisted on the need for authoritarian leaders. These events inspired his next two works, \"Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question\" (1849), in which he coined the term \"Dismal Science\" to describe political economy, and Latter-Day Pamphlets (1850). The illiberal content of these works sullied Carlyle's reputation for some progressives, while endearing him to those that shared his views. In 1851, Carlyle wrote The Life of John Sterling as a corrective to Julius Hare's unsatisfactory 1848 biography. In late September and early October, he made his second trip to Paris, where he met Adolphe Thiers and Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e; his account, \"Excursion (Futile Enough) to Paris; Autumn 1851\", was published posthumously.[114]/nIn 1852, Carlyle began research on Frederick the Great, whom he had expressed interest in writing a biography of as early as 1830.[115] He travelled to Germany that year, examining source documents and prior histories. Carlyle struggled through research and writing, telling von Ense it was \"the poorest, most troublesome and arduous piece of work he has ever undertaken\".[116] In 1856, the first two volumes of History of Friedrich II. of Prussia, Called Frederick the Great were sent to the press and published in 1858. During this time, he wrote \"The Opera\" (1852), \"Project of a National Exhibition of Scottish Portraits\" (1854) at the request of David Laing, and \"The Prinzenraub\" (1855). In October 1855, he finished The Guises, a history of the House of Guise and its relation to Scottish history, which was first published in 1981.[117] Carlyle made a second expedition to Germany in 1858 to survey the topography of battlefields, which he documented in Journey to Germany, Autumn 1858, published posthumously. In May 1863, Carlyle wrote the short dialogue \"Ilias (Americana) in Nuce\" (American Iliad in a Nutshell) on the topic of the American Civil War. Upon publication in August, the \"Ilias\" drew scornful letters from David Atwood Wasson and Horace Howard Furness.[118] In the summer of 1864, Carlyle lived at 117 Marina (built by James Burton)[119] in St Leonards-on-Sea, in order to be nearer to his ailing wife who was in possession of caretakers there.[120]/nCarlyle planned to write four volumes but had written six by the time Frederick was finished in 1865. Before its end, Carlyle had developed a tremor in his writing hand.[121] Upon its completion, it was received as a masterpiece. He earned a sobriquet, the \"Sage of Chelsea\",[122] and in the eyes of those that had rebuked his politics, it restored Carlyle to his position as a great man of letters.[123] Carlyle was elected Lord Rector of Edinburgh University in November 1865, succeeding William Ewart Gladstone and defeating Benjamin Disraeli by a vote of 657 to 310.[124]/nCarlyle travelled to Scotland to deliver his \"Inaugural Address at Edinburgh\" as Rector in April 1866. During his trip, he was accompanied by John Tyndall, Thomas Henry Huxley, and Thomas Erskine. One of those that welcomed Carlyle on his arrival was Sir David Brewster, president of the university and the commissioner of Carlyle's first professional writings for the Edinburgh Encyclop\u00e6dia. Carlyle was joined onstage by his fellow travellers, Brewster, Moncure D. Conway, George Harvey, Lord Neaves, and others. Carlyle spoke extemporaneously on several subjects, concluding his address with a quote from Goethe: \"Work, and despair not: Wir heissen euch hoffen, 'We bid you be of hope!'\" Tyndall reported to Jane in a three-word telegram that it was \"A perfect triumph.\"[125] The warm reception he received in his homeland of Scotland marked the climax of Carlyle's life as a writer. While still in Scotland, Carlyle received abrupt news of Jane's sudden death in London. Upon her death, Carlyle began to edit his wife's letters and write reminiscences of her. He experienced feelings of guilt as he read her complaints about her illnesses, his friendship with Lady Harriet Ashburton, and his devotion to his labour, particularly on Frederick the Great. Although deep in grief, Carlyle remained active in public life.[126]/nAmidst controversy over governor John Eyre's violent repression of the Morant Bay rebellion, Carlyle assumed leadership of the Eyre Defence and Aid Fund in 1865 and 1866. The Defence had convened in response to the anti-Eyre Jamaica Committee, led by Mill and backed by Charles Darwin, Herbert Spencer, and others. Carlyle and the Defence were supported by John Ruskin, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Charles Dickens, and Charles Kingsley.[127][128] From December 1866 to March 1867,[129] Carlyle resided at the home of Louisa Baring, Lady Ashburton in Menton, where he wrote reminiscences of Irving, Jeffrey, Robert Southey, and William Wordsworth. In August, he published \"Shooting Niagara: And After?\", an essay in response and opposition to the Second Reform Bill.[130] In 1868, he wrote reminiscences of John Wilson and William Hamilton, and his niece Mary Aitken Carlyle moved into 5 Cheyne Row, becoming his caretaker and assisting in the editing of Jane's letters. In March 1869, he met with Queen Victoria, who wrote in her journal of \"Mr. Carlyle, the historian, a strange-looking eccentric old Scotchman, who holds forth, in a drawling melancholy voice, with a broad Scotch accent, upon Scotland and upon the utter degeneration of everything.\"[131] In 1870, he was elected president of the London Library, and in November he wrote a letter to The Times in support of Germany in the Franco-Prussian War. His conversation was recorded by a number of friends and visitors in later years, most notably William Allingham, who became known as Carlyle's Boswell.[132]/nIn the spring of 1874, Carlyle accepted the Pour le M\u00e9rite f\u00fcr Wissenschaften und K\u00fcnste from Otto von Bismarck and declined Disraeli's offers of a state pension and the Knight Grand Cross in the Order of the Bath in the autumn. On the occasion of his eightieth birthday in 1875, he was presented with a commemorative medal crafted by Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm and an address of admiration signed by 119 of the leading writers, scientists, and public figures of the day.[a] \"Early Kings of Norway\", a recounting of historical material from the Icelandic sagas transcribed by Mary acting as his amanuensis,[133] and an essay on \"The Portraits of John Knox\" (both 1875) were his last major writings to be published in his lifetime. In November 1876, he wrote a letter in the Times \"On the Eastern Question\", entreating England not to enter the Russo-Turkish War on the side of the Turks. Another letter to the Times in May 1877 \"On the Crisis\", urging against the rumoured wish of Disraeli's to send a fleet to the Baltic Sea and warning not to provoke Russia and Europe at large into a war against England, marked his last public utterance.[134] The American Academy of Arts and Sciences elected him a Foreign Honorary Member in 1878.[135]/nOn 2 February 1881, Carlyle fell into a coma. For a moment he awakened, and Mary heard him speak his final words: \"So this is Death\u2014well ...\"[136] He thereafter lost his speech and died on the morning of 5 February.[137] An offer of interment at Westminster Abbey, which he had anticipated, was declined by his executors in accordance with his will.[138] He was laid to rest with his mother and father in Hoddam Kirkyard in Ecclefechan, according to old Scottish custom.[139] His private funeral, held on 10 February, was attended by family and a few friends, including Froude, Conway, Tyndall, and William Lecky, as local residents looked on.[126]/nCarlyle's corpus spans the genres of \"criticism, biography, history, politics, poetry, and religion.\"[141] His innovative writing style, known as Carlylese, greatly influenced Victorian literature and anticipated techniques of postmodern literature.[142]/nIn Carlylean philosophy, while not adhering to any formal religion, he asserted the importance of belief during an age of increasing doubt. Much of his work is concerned with the modern human spiritual condition; he was the first writer to use the expression \"meaning of life\".[143] In Sartor Resartus and in his early Miscellanies, he developed his own philosophy of religion based upon what he called \"Natural Supernaturalism\",[144] the idea that all things are \"Clothes\" which at once reveal and conceal the divine, that \"a mystic bond of brotherhood makes all men one\",[145] and that duty, work and silence are essential./nCarlyle postulated the Great Man theory, a philosophy of history which contends that history is shaped by exceptional individuals. This approach to history was first promulgated in his lectures On Heroes and given specific focus in longer studies like Cromwell and Frederick the Great. He viewed history as a \"Prophetic Manuscript\" that progresses on a cyclical basis, analogous to the phoenix and the seasons. His historiographical method emphasises the relationship between the event at hand and all those which precede and follow it, which he makes apparent through use of the present (rather than past) tense in his French Revolution and in other histories./nRaising the \"Condition-of-England Question\"[146] to address the impact of the Industrial Revolution, Carlyle's social and political philosophy is characterised by medievalism,[147] advocating a \"Chivalry of Labour\"[148] led by \"Captains of Industry\".[149] In works of social criticism such as Past and Present and Latter-Day Pamphlets, he attacked utilitarianism as mere atheism and egoism,[150] criticised the political economy of laissez-faire as the \"Dismal Science\",[151] and rebuked \"big black Democracy\",[152] while championing \"Heroarchy (Government of Heroes)\".[153]/nJames Anthony Froude recalled his first impression of Carlyle:/nHe was then fifty-four years old; tall (about five feet eleven), thin, but at that time upright, with no signs of the later stoop. His body was angular, his face beardless, such as it is represented in Woolner's medallion,[b] which is by far the best likeness of him in the days of his strength. His head was extremely long, with the chin thrust forward; his neck was thin; the mouth firmly closed, the under lip slightly projecting; the hair grizzled and thick and bushy. His eyes, which grew lighter with age, were then of a deep violet, with fire burning at the bottom of them, which flashed out at the least excitement. The face was altogether most striking, most impressive in every way.[155]/nHe was often recognised by his wideawake hat.[156]/nCarlyle was a renowned conversationalist. Ralph Waldo Emerson described him as \"an immense talker, as extraordinary in his conversation as in his writing,\u2014I think even more so.\" Charles Darwin considered him \"the most worth listening to, of any man I know.\"[157] William Lecky noted his \"singularly musical voice\" which \"quite took away anything grotesque in the very strong Scotch accent\" and \"gave it a softening or charm\".[158] Henry Fielding Dickens recollected that he was \"gifted with a high sense of humour, and when he laughed he did so heartily, throwing his head back and letting himself go.\"[159] Thomas Wentworth Higginson remembered his \"broad, honest, human laugh,\" one that \"cleared the air like thunder, and left the atmosphere sweet.\"[160] Lady Eastlake called it \"the best laugh I ever heard\".[161]/nCharles Eliot Norton wrote that Carlyle's \"essential nature was solitary in its strength, its sincerity, its tenderness, its nobility. He was nearer Dante than any other man.\"[162] Frederic Harrison similarly observed that \"Carlyle walked about London like Dante in the streets of Verona, gnawing his own heart and dreaming dreams of Inferno. To both the passers-by might have said, See! there goes the man who has seen hell\".[163] Higginson rather felt that Jean Paul's humorous character Siebenk\u00e4s \"came nearer to the actual Carlyle than most of the grave portraitures yet executed\", for, like Siebenk\u00e4s, Carlyle was \"a satirical improvisatore\".[164] Emerson saw Carlyle as \"not mainly a scholar,\" but \"a practical Scotchman, such as you would find in any saddler's or iron-dealer's shop, and then only accidentally and by a surprising addition, the admirable scholar and writer he is.\"[165]/nPaul Elmer More found Carlyle \"a figure unique, isolated, domineering\u2014after Dr. Johnson the greatest personality in English letters, possibly even more imposing than that acknowledged dictator.\"[166]/nGeorge Eliot summarised Carlyle's impact in 1855:/nIt is an idle question to ask whether his books will be read a century hence: if they were all burnt as the grandest of Suttees on his funeral pile, it would be only like cutting down an oak after its acorns have sown a forest. For there is hardly a superior or active mind of this generation that has not been modified by Carlyle's writings; there has hardly been an English book written for the last ten or twelve years that would not have been different if Carlyle had not lived.[167]/nCarlyle's two most important followers were Emerson and Ruskin. In the 19th century, Emerson was often thought of as \"the American Carlyle\",[168] and he described himself in 1870 as \"Lieutenant\" to Carlyle's \"General in Chief\".[169] Ruskin publicly acknowledged that Carlyle was the author to whom he \"owed more than to any other living writer\",[170] and would frequently refer to him as his \"master\", writing after Carlyle's death that he was \"throwing myself now into the mere fulfilment of Carlyle's work\".[171]/nBritish philosopher J. H. Muirhead wrote that in his rejection of philosophical scepticism and embrace of German idealism, Carlyle \"exercised an influence in England and America that no other did upon the course of philosophical thought of his time\".[172]/n\"The most explosive impact in English literature during the nineteenth century is unquestionably Thomas Carlyle's\", writes Lionel Stevenson. \"From about 1840 onward, no author of prose or poetry was immune from his influence.\"[173] By 1960, he had become \"the single most frequent topic of doctoral dissertations in the field of Victorian literature\".[174] While preparing for a study of his own, German scholar Gerhart von Schulze-G\u00e4vernitz found himself overwhelmed by the amount of material already written about Carlyle\u2014in 1894.[15]/nAuthors on whom Carlyle's influence was particularly strong include Matthew Arnold,[175] Elizabeth Barrett Browning,[176] Robert Browning,[177] Arthur Hugh Clough,[178] Dickens, Disraeli, George Eliot,[179] Elizabeth Gaskell,[180] Frank Harris,[181] Kingsley, George Henry Lewes,[182] David Masson, George Meredith,[183] Mill, Margaret Oliphant, Luigi Pirandello,[184] Marcel Proust,[185][186] Ruskin, George Bernard Shaw,[187] and Walt Whitman.[188] Germaine Br\u00e9e has shown the considerable impact that Carlyle had on the thought of Andr\u00e9 Gide.[189] Carlylean influence is also seen in the writings of Ry\u016bnosuke Akutagawa, Leopoldo Alas,[190] Marcu Beza, Jorge Luis Borges, the Bront\u00ebs,[191] Arthur Conan Doyle, Antonio Fogazzaro,[184] E. M. Forster, \u00c1ngel Ganivet, Lafcadio Hearn, William Ernest Henley, Marietta Holley, Rudyard Kipling,[192] Selma Lagerl\u00f6f, Herman Melville,[193] Alfredo Panzini,[184] Edgar Quinet, Samuel Smiles, Tokutomi Soh\u014d,[194] Lord Tennyson, William Makepeace Thackeray, Anthony Trollope, Miguel de Unamuno, Alexandru Vlahu\u021b\u0103, and Vasile Voiculescu.[195][196]/nCarlyle's German essays and translations as well as his own writings were pivotal to the development of the English Bildungsroman.[197] His concept of symbols influenced French literary Symbolism.[198] Victorian specialist Alice Chandler writes that the influence of his medievalism is \"found throughout the literature of the Victorian age\".[199]/nCarlyle's influence was also felt in the negative sense. Algernon Charles Swinburne, whose comments on Carlyle throughout his writings range from high praise to scathing critique, once wrote to John Morley that Carlyle was \"the illustrious enemy whom we all lament\", reflecting a view of Carlyle as a totalizing figure to be rebelled against.[200]/nDespite the broad Modernist reaction against the Victorians, the influence of Carlyle has been traced in the writings of T. S. Eliot,[201] James Joyce, Wyndham Lewis,[202] and D. H. Lawrence.[203]/nPolitically, Carlyle's influence spans across ideologies, from conservatism and communism to nationalism and socialism. He is acknowledged as an essential influence on Young England conservatism,[205] Christian socialism,[206] and the fin de si\u00e8cle labor movement.[207] His work is referenced in the writings of a diverse range of political writers, including Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels,[208] Mahatma Gandhi,[209] and Richard Wagner.[210] Prominent Young Ireland nationalist John Mitchel[211] and Antebellum South secessionist George Fitzhugh[212] were both deeply influenced by Carlyle. Many social reformers were inspired by him, including Octavia Hill,[213] Emmeline Pankhurst,[214] Jane Addams,[215] W. E. B. Du Bois,[216] and Martin Luther King Jr.[217] More recently, figures associated with neoreaction and the alt-right have claimed Carlyle as an influence, notably Curtis Yarvin,[218] Jonathan Bowden,[219] and Kerry Bolton.[220]/nScholars have been divided on whether Carlyle himself was conservative: Herbert Tingsten has said that he was,[221] while Simon Heffer says that he was not.[222]/nCarlyle's medievalist critique of industrial practice and political economy was an early utterance of what would become the spirit of both the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and the Arts and Crafts movement, and several leading members recognised his importance.[223] John William Mackail, friend and official biographer of William Morris, wrote, that in the years of Morris and Edward Burne-Jones attendance at Oxford, Past and Present stood as \"inspired and absolute truth.\"[224] Morris read a letter from Carlyle at the first public meeting of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings.[225] Fiona MacCarthy, a recent biographer, affirmed that Morris was \"deeply and lastingly\" indebted to Carlyle.[226] William Holman Hunt considered Carlyle to be a mentor of his. He used Carlyle as one of the models for the head of Christ in The Light of the World and showed great concern for Carlyle's portrayal in Ford Madox Brown's painting Work (1865).[227] Carlyle helped Thomas Woolner to find work early in his career and throughout, and the sculptor would become \"a kind of surrogate son\" to the Carlyles, referring to Carlyle as \"the dear old philosopher\".[228] Phoebe Anna Traquair depicted Carlyle, one of her favourite writers, in murals painted for the Royal Hospital for Sick Children and St Mary's Cathedral in Edinburgh.[229] According to Marylu Hill, the Roycrofters were \"very influenced by Carlyle's words about work and the necessity of work\", with his name appearing frequently in their writings, which are held at Villanova University.[230]/nThackeray wrote that Carlyle had done more than any other to give \"art for art's sake ... its independence.\"[231] Roberts explains that Carlyle \"did much to set the stage for the Aesthetic Movement\" through both his German and original writings, noting that he even popularised (if not introduced) the term \"\u00c6esthetics\" into the English language, leading her to declare him as \"the apostle of aesthetics in England, 1825\u201327.\"[232] Carlyle's rhetorical style and his views on art also provided a foundation for aestheticism, particularly that of Walter Pater, Wilde, and W. B. Yeats.[233]/nCarlyle had entrusted his papers to the care of James Anthony Froude after his death but was unclear about the permissions granted to him. Froude edited and published the Reminiscences in 1881, which sparked controversy due to Froude's failure to excise comments that might offend living persons, as was common practice at the time. The book damaged Carlyle's reputation, as did the following Letters and Memorials of Jane Welsh Carlyle and the four-volume biography of life as written by Froude. The image that Froude presented of Carlyle and his marriage was highly negative, prompting new editions of the Reminiscences and the letters by Charles Eliot Norton and Alexander Carlyle (husband of Carlyle's niece), who argued that, among other things, Froude had mishandled the materials entrusted to him in a deliberate and dishonest manner. This argument overshadowed Carlyle's work for decades. Owen Dudley Edwards remarked that by the turn of the century, \"Carlyle was known more than read\".[234] As Campbell describes:/nThe effect of Froude\u2019s work in the years following Carlyle\u2019s death was extraordinary. Almost overnight, it seemed, Carlyle plunged from his position as Sage of Chelsea and Grand Old Victorian to the object of puzzled dislike, or even of revulsion.[235]/nFielding writes that Carlyle \"was often ready to play up to being a caricature of prejudice\".[236] Targets for his ire included the French, the Irish, Slavs,[237] Turks, Americans, Catholics, and, most explicitly, blacks and Jews. According to Duffy, when he charged Carlyle with having \"taught [John] Mitchel to oppose the liberation of the negroes and the emancipation of the Jews\", Carlyle replied:/nMitchel ... would be found to be right in the end; the black man could not be emancipated from the laws of nature, which had pronounced a very decided decree on the question, and neither could the Jew.[238]/nIn his biography of Carlyle, Fred Kaplan suggests that Carlyle \"resembled most of his contemporaries\" in his beliefs about Jews, identifying them with capitalist materialism and outmoded religious orthodoxy.[239][240] He wished that the English would throw off their \"Hebrew Old-Clothes\" and abandon the Hebraic element in Christianity, or Christianity altogether.[241] Carlyle had once considered writing a book called Exodus from Houndsditch,[c] \"a pealing off of fetid Jewhood in every sense from myself and my poor bewildered brethren\".[242] Froude described Carlyle's aversion to the Jews as \"Teutonic\". He felt they had contributed nothing to the \"wealth\" of mankind, comparing \"the Jews with their morbid imaginations and foolish sheepskin Targums\" to \"The Norse with their steel swords guided by fresh valiant hearts and clear veracious understanding\".[243][244] Carlyle refused an invitation by Baron Rothschild in 1848 to support a Bill in Parliament to allow voting rights for Jews in the United Kingdom, asking Richard Monckton Milnes in a correspondence how a Jew could \"try to be Senator, or even Citizen, of any Country, except his own wretched Palestine,\" and expressed his hope that they would \"arrive\" in Palestine \"as soon as possible\".[245]/nHenry Crabb Robinson heard Carlyle at dinner in 1837 speak approvingly of slavery. \"It is a natural aristocracy, that of colour, and quite right that the stronger and better race should have dominion!\"[246] The 1853 pamphlet \"Occasional Discourse on the Nigger Question\" expressed concern for the excesses of the practice, considering \"How to abolish the abuses of slavery, and save the precious thing in it.\"[247]/nFrom Goethe's recognition of Carlyle as \"a moral force of great importance\" in 1827 to the celebration of his centennial as though he were a national hero in 1895, Carlyle had long enjoyed a high reputation in Germany.[248] Passages from Frederick were even part of the curriculum in German schools. Carlyle's support of Bismarck and the Silesian Wars led to suspicion during the Great War that he would have supported the German Empire and its leaders (such as Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg and Gottlieb von Jagow). Allied nations largely regarded Carlyle as a Prussianist, the \"spiritual brother of Clausewitz and Treitschke.\" Prussian statesmen had identified Carlyle's \"gospel of force\" with their doctrine of Weltmacht oder Untergang (World Power or Downfall) in order to \"make their own side respectable.\" Herbert L. Stewart defended Carlyle's memory by arguing that besides a shared opposition to democracy, his belief that \"Right makes Might\"[d] is \"far removed\" from \"the ethic of militarism\", and his \"Puritan Theodicy\" has nothing to do with the \"Immoralism of German Kriegsherren\" (Warlords).[250]/nWith the rise of Adolf Hitler, many agreed with the assessment of K. O. Schmidt in 1933, who came to see Carlyle as den ersten englischen Nationalsozialisten (the first English National Socialist). William Joyce (founder of the National Socialist League and the Carlyle Club, a cultural arm of the NSL named for Carlyle)[251] wrote of how \"Germany has repaid him for his scholarship on her behalf by honouring his philosophy when it is scorned in Britain.\"[252] German academics viewed him as having been immersed in and an outgrowth of German culture, just as National Socialism was. They proposed that Heroes and Hero-Worship justified the F\u00fchrerprinzip (Leadership principle). Theodor Jost wrote in 1935: \"Carlyle established, in fact, the mission of the F\u00fchrer historically and philosophically. He fights, himself a F\u00fchrer, vigorously against the masses, he ... becomes a pathfinder for new thoughts and forms.\" Parallels were also drawn between Carlyle's critique of Victorian England in Latter-Day Pamphlets and Nazi opposition to the Weimar Republic.[248]/nSome believed that Carlyle was German by blood. Echoing Paul Hensel's earlier claim in 1901 that Carlyle's Volkscharakter (Folk character) had preserved \"the peculiarity of the Low German tribe\", Egon Friedell, an anti-Nazi and Jewish Austrian, explained in 1935 that Carlyle's affinity with Germany stemmed from his being \"a Scotsman of the lowlands, where the Celtic imprint is far more marginal than it is with the High Scottish and the Low German element is even stronger than it is in England.\"[253] Others regarded him, if not ethnically German, as a Geist von unserem Geist (Spirit from our Spirit), as Karl Richter wrote in 1937: \"Carlyle's ethos is the ethos of the Nordic soul par excellence.\"[254]/nIn 1945, Joseph Goebbels frequently sought consolation from Carlyle's History of Frederick the Great. Goebbels read passages from the book to Hitler during his last days in the F\u00fchrerbunker.[255]/nWhile some Germans were eager to claim Carlyle for the Reich, others were more aware of incompatibilities. In 1936, Theodor Deimel argued that because of the \"profound difference\" between Carlyle's philosophical foundation of \"a personally shaped religious idea\" and the V\u00f6lkisch foundation of National Socialism, the designation of Carlyle as the \"first National Socialist\" is \"mistaken\".[256] Ernst Cassirer rejected the notion of Carlyle as proto-fascist in The Myth of the State (1946), emphasizing the moral underpinning of his thought. G.B. Tennyson has also commented that Carlyle's anti-modernist and anti-egoist stances disqualify him from association with 20th-century totalitarianism.[257]/nThe standard edition of Carlyle's works is the Works in Thirty Volumes, also known as the Centenary Edition. The date given is when the work was \"originally published.\"/nThis is a list of selected books, pamphlets and broadsides uncollected in the Miscellanies through 1880 as well as posthumous first editions and unpublished manuscripts.[258]/nCategory", "73364910": "Susan Baker Empson is an American scholar of mathematics education whose work includes longitudinal studies of children's mathematical development, the use of Cognitively Guided Instruction in mathematics education, analyses of childhood understanding of the concept of fractions, and research on the professional development of mathematics educators.

S. Venkataraman (14 September 1918 \u2013 16 March 1994), popularly known as CSV, was a mathematician from Kerala, India. He specialised in the theory of numbers, his forte was the theory of arithmetic functions./nKnown to his friends as CSV, Venkataraman was born at Chelakkara, a small village in Thrissur District, India, on 14 September 1918 as the son of late C V Subbarama Iyer, who was also a professor of mathematics at the University College, Trivandrum, for a long time and later as the principal in 1951./nAfter his early education in his native village and in Trivandrum, he had his higher education at the Presidency College, Chennai, where he had the opportunity of studying under the eminent K. Ananda Rau, who was a contemporary and a friend of Ramanujan and a student of Hardy at University of Cambridge. Naturally, CSV got the inspiration to become a mathematician from his great professor, Ananda Rau, and also, he got an opportunity to get introduced to another mathematical genius R. Vaidyanathaswamy, who had already established himself at the University of Madras in the 1930s and had set up a tradition and an academic atmosphere that gave Madras international recognition in the field of mathematics. CSV was selected as a research scholar in the Department of Mathematics of Madras University to do research in Theory of Arithmetic function under the guidance of R Vaidyanathaswamy. In fact, there he was in the eminent company of senior research scholars like P Kesava Menon and K G Ramanathan and the theory of multiplicative function formed the material for the dissertations of P Kesava Menon and CSV. The theory of arithmetic functions was initiated in the 1930s by E. T. Bell of the California Institute of Technology and independently by R Vaidyanathaswamy. CSV expounded the theory in a series of remarkable research papers which soon became a classic and CSV was awarded the Ph.D. degree by the University of Madras in 1952 for his \"Contributions to the Theory of Multiplicative Functions\". During the work leading to the award of Ph.D. degree, he derived a new identity for multiplicative functions of two variables. Vaidyanathaswami's identity for multiplicative functions which appeared in Transactions of the American Mathematical Society in 1931 could be deduced from that of CSV's./nIn view of his contributions to the theory of numbers, CSV was nominated for a visiting professorship at the University of North Carolina, Durham, NC, US. This was for possible collaboration with Leonard Carlitz, who learned of CSV's research interest. Though CSV wanted to continue with full-time research, s sudden turn of events in his family circumstances forced him to be near his home town and hence he accepted an offer of a lectureship at Union Christian College, Aluva. After spending a brief time there, he joined the Sree Kerala Varma College, Thrissur, in 1947, where he remained as a professor till retirement. The college he chose to serve had no pretensions of being in the elite league of colleges in Kerala, and it was usually dubbed as a common man's college.[1] Because of his passion for research and teaching, CSV also did not accept the post of the principal of the college, a position which was offered to him at a very young age. Due to CSV's active interest in research, the Department of Mathematics of Sree Kerala Varma College was recognized as a research centre for mathematics by the University of Kerala in 1961. A.C. Vasu and R. Sivaramakrishnan were his doctoral students./nHe was a member of Indian Mathematical Society since 1945. Mathematicians all over India knew CSV, and it was CSV who for a long time represented Kerala at conferences and meetings. On account of his professional and academic achievements, his name finds, justifiably, a place in the World Directory of Mathematicians published in 1986 under the auspices of the International Mathematical Union. He was a towering personality in the realm of higher mathematics in Kerala for more than three decades. Kerala has produced some world-class number theorists, among whom CSV occupies a pride of place along with his predecessors Sivasankarnarayana Pillai (whom Hardy described as Ramanujan's worthy successor) and P Kesava Menon.

After emigrating to the United States, Degayev took the name Alexander Pell and became a prominent American mathematician, the founder of school of Engineering at the University of South Dakota. The Dr. Alexander Pell scholarship is named in his honor.[1]/nSergey Degayev was born in Moscow to the family of a military physician, state counsellor Peter Degayev.[2] His maternal grandfather was a prominent Russian writer, Nikolai Polevoy.[3] His father died in the 1860s,[2] and Degayev's mother became the head of the family; she was, for her time, a well-educated woman, whose interests included reading and learning foreign languages. When the court sentenced pregnant revolutionary Hesya Helfman to death, she tried, unsuccessfully, to adopt the baby, despite a possible conflict with the authorities.[3][4]/nDegayev had three sisters\u2014Marie, Nathalie, and Elizabeth\u2014and a brother Vladimir, who was seven years his junior. While Marie was much older than Sergey, married early and did not play a large role in the life of the family, Nathalie (after marriage Makletsova) and Elizabeth (Liz) were very close to him. Natalie was a musician, while Elizabeth was a poet. Both sisters were involved in the Narodnaya Volya revolutionary movement. Vladimir was also deeply involved with Narodnaya Volya. As the oldest son, Sergey had to provide financial support for the family.[2][3]/nAt the age of nine, Sergey entered a Moscow Cadet school. After graduation, Sergey entered the Mikhailovskaya Artillery Academy in Saint Petersburg. He was accused of organizing anti-government underground \"circles\" in Saint Petersburg and Kronstadt.[5] The accusations were never proven, but in 1879, Degayev was nevertheless expelled from the Academia. He briefly served as a military officer and was discharged from the Army with the rank of Staff captain in the same year.[6]/nDegayev was enrolled to the Saint Petersburg Institute for Rail Road Engineering in 1880.[1] During his studies, he became acquainted with Andrei Zhelyabov and members of his circle; and in 1880, he became a full-fledged member of Narodnaya Volya, a revolutionary organization that turned to terrorist methods. After the 1879 Lipetsk Congress of Narodnaya Volya, which \"sentenced\" tsar Alexander II to death, most of the organization's resources were directed to the tsar's assassination. Degayev took an active part in an unsuccessful assassination attempt by digging and mining a tunnel under Malaya Sadovaya Street in Saint Petersburg.[7] Some sources also suggest that Degayev had a role in the successful assassination of the tsar on 1 March 1881 and even observed the explosion that killed him.[7] Degayev was among those arrested in connection with the assassination, but his guilt was not proven; he returned to his institute and received his degree in June 1881.[1]/nAfter graduating Degayev obtained an engineering position in Arkhangelsk. There he met Lyubov Ivanova, a young woman who shared his political views; he fell in love and married her on their trip to Saint Petersburg in November 1881.[1]/nAt that time, Gendarme Lieutenant Colonel Georgy Sudeykin was among the most dangerous enemies of Narodnaya Volya. He had eliminated the Kiev division of Narodnaya Volya almost entirely and was appointed the Head of the Secret Department of police of Saint Petersburg, responsible for coordination of all the secret agents in the capital of the Russian Empire. Later he would be appointed a special position of the Inspector of the Secret Police, a post specially created for him. As the primary hunter of Narodnaya Volya, he was also a main target of their assassination attempts. Sudeykin rarely lived in the same place for more than a few weeks; he used several passports and several uniforms of different governmental departments. He even temporarily lodged his wife and children in a Saint Petersburg prison, given that he felt it was the only safe place in the whole Empire.[8]/nSudeykin was an avid supporter of using agent provocateurs inside the revolutionary movements not only to catch the active members but also to instigate quarrels and disputes, spread false rumours, and transmit the opinion that all the leading revolutionaries were spies or provocateurs. He was proud of his successes in recruiting his agents among the revolutionaries claiming that every member of an anti-government movement is either corrupt or naive: the corrupt can always be recruited by promise of money or by threats while the naive can always be recruited by appeal to their idealism.[8]/nAround November 1881 Vladimir, the younger brother of Degayev, was arrested for his participation in the Narodnaya Volya movement. He was interrogated by Sudeykin, who offered Vladimir freedom in exchange for collaboration with the Okhrana. Vladimir managed to inform the Executive Committee of Narodnaya Volya about the offer. Degayev participated in the discussions and proposed a plan: that Vladimir should accept Sudeikin's offer, and after becoming a police informer should arrange a secret meeting with Sudeykin at which Narodnaya Volya would kill Sudeykin. In March 1882 the plan was adopted by the Executive Commission of Narodnaya Volya. Vladimir agreed to work as an Okhrana agent, was released from prison and arranged a few meetings between Sudeykin and Sergey Degaev, who was charged with preparing for the assassination. However, soon most of Petersburg's Narodnaya Volya members were arrested. Sergey Degayev moved to Tiflis to avoid the arrests and work on the Tiflis-Baku railway. Vladimir Degayev abandoned the plan of killing Sudeykin and was soon removed from the list of Okhrana agents \"for inactivity.\"[1][5][9]/nIn summer 1882, Degayev worked in Tiflis as a railroad engineer and organized Narodnaya Volya circles among Tiflis military officers. He presented himself as a member of the Executive Committee of Narodnaya Volya although he was not a member at that time. In autumn 1882, most of the Narodnaya Volya members in Tiflis were arrested and Degayev was ordered by the Narodnaya Volya leader Vera Figner to move to Odessa and organize an underground press there. On 18 December 1883 Degayev and the whole of his group was arrested.[9]/nAfter interrogation by Georgy Sudeykin, Degayev agreed to become an Okhrana informant. Almost all information about the deal came from Degayev himself, in an explanation he gave to his sister Natalia and to a Narodnaya Volya \"court.\" According to Degayev, Sudeykin had appealed to his vanity and idealism. Sudeykin promised that in a few years they both would be de facto rulers of the Russian Empire by using the Okhrana to remove Degayev's superiors in Narodnaya Volya and by using Narodnaya Volya to remove Sudeykin's superiors in the Okhrana. He also promised Degayev secret meetings with tsar Alexander III, the police chief Vyacheslav von Plehve and the influential Ober-Procurator of the Holy Synod Konstantin Pobedonostsev so that Degayev could present to them his plan of state reforms. According to Degayev, he indeed met Plehve and Pobedonostsev but not the tsar.[3] However, research in the Soviet Union suggested that Degayev started to work as an Okhrana informant a few years earlier purely for financial reasons.[9] Researcher Yu.F. Ovchenko states that Degayev started to work as an Okhrana informant in 1882 after his wife was arrested by Sudeykin. His cooperation with the Okhrana was a condition of Lyubov's release[10] At any rate the agreement with Sudeykin provided a handsome monetary compensation for Degayev: 300 Russian roubles monthly plus 1000 roubles for each trip abroad.[11]/nSudeykin staged Degayev's escape from prison. Information obtained from Degayev allowed the Okhrana to arrest the leader of Narodnaya Volya Vera Figner, to almost completely destroy the military wing of the organization, to arrest almost all members in the Tiflis, Nikolaev, and Kharkov organizations.[9] After those arrests Degayev became a de facto leader of Narodnaya Volya.[3][12] Information obtained from Degayev and from subsequent arrests allowed police to assure the tsar that his coronation ceremony would be safe. Alexander III was crowned on 27 May 1883.[13]/nInspired by Alexandre Dumas's novel The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later, Sudeykin sent Degayev to Switzerland to lure two remaining Narodnaya Volya leaders, Lev Tikhomirov and Peter Lavrov, to Russia to be arrested. Tikhomirov and Lavrov suspected foul play and refused to move but kept their suspicions to themselves for a while.[14] Trying to deflect suspicions from Degayev, Sudeykin decided to sacrifice police informer Fyodor Shkryaba, a member of Narodnaya Volya recruited by the Okhrana who still provided information of low interest to the Okhrana. Sudeykin planted evidence of Shkryaba being an informant and Narodnaya Volya blamed all the recent arrests on Shkryaba. Subsequently Degayev organized the assassination of Shkryaba.[13]/nIn June 1883 Narodnaya Volya resumed publication of Listok Narodnoy Voly, an underground newspaper, as a demonstration that the organization was alive. Degayev published an article praising pogroms against Jews and urging members to incite more pogroms. At the time, Narodnaya Volya had an ambivalent position on antisemitism. Some theoreticians applied Marxist analysis and saw pogroms as a manifestation of the class struggle between oppressed peasants and oppressive Jewish petite bourgeoisie. On the other hand, many Narodnaya Volya members saw pogroms as incited by the tsarist Government and as one of the most revolting of the regime's crimes. The question of antisemitism was rendered even more divisive by the fact that many members were ethnic Jews. Richard Pipes speculated that the article was a part of Sudeykin's plan to transform Narodnaya Volya from an anti-government to an ultra-nationalist organisation similar to the later Black Hundreds.[15]/nToward the middle of 1883, Sudeykin and Degayev established quite friendly relations. Sudeykin regularly visited the apartment of his agent and even used the apartment for his extramarital affairs. Sometimes they had wagers: once, Degayev announced that there was a person of interest to police in Saint Petersburg at the moment and claimed that Sudeykin would not be able to catch him without Degayev's help. Sudeykin answered that he had enough agents besides Degayev. The pair had a monetary bet that Sudeykin would not be able to effect an arrest: Sudeykin lost.[13]/nAt that time Sudeykin was frustrated with his superiors. He did not like their attempts to put legal constraints on the actions of his secret police. He also considered his rank of Lieutenant Colonel (the seventh in the Table of Ranks) to be absurdly low for a person of his importance within the state security apparatus. Sudeykin proposed to Degayev a plan[citation needed] . Sudeykin would resign from his position, stating that he did not have enough powers to do his job properly. Soon Narodnaya Volya would assassinate the tsar's brother Grand Duke Vladimir and the tsar's aide Konstantin Pobedonostsev. The double assassination would frighten the tsar into accepting all Sudeykin's demands over the powers of secret police and might, too, make the tsar more responsive to Degayev's suggestions about government reforms.  Sudeykin also gave Degayev information about the movements of Sudeykin's own boss, the Minister of Interior Dmitry Tolstoy considering that the killing might free a deserved position for Sudeykin. Unexpectedly the tsar refused Sudeykin's letter of resignation, causing the pair to postpone assassination plans to 1884.[13]/nSome immigrant members of Narodnaya Volya harbored suspicions about Degayev, which were confirmed after Degayev talked with another prominent Narodnaya Volya member, German Lopatin, an experienced escapee from prisons himself. Lopatin found many inconsistencies in Degayev's story about his escape from Odessa prison. Interrogated by Lev Tikhomirov, Degayev confessed that he was an Okhrana agent and offered to help kill Sudeykin. On 17 October \u2013 19 October 1883, the Executive Committee of Narodnaya Volya, which at that time consisted of eight Russians and three Poles, decided to spare Degayev's life if he killed Sudeykin. They appointed two young Narodnaya Volya members, V. P. Konashevich and N. P. Starodvorsky to assist Degayev and to ensure that Degayev would not renege on his promise.[16]/nThe conspirators planned to get Sudeykin to visit Degayev's apartment and to kill him there. Degayev insisted that because of Sudeykin's great physical strength and his great ability with guns, their only chance was to shoot Sudeykin unexpectedly. For some reason Sudeykin twice missed his appointed meetings (6 December 1883 and 13 December 1883). To lure Sudeykin to the next meeting Degayev told him a story that he had a woman from Narodnaya Volya staying in his apartment who had planned to assassinate the tsar but who could possibly be persuaded to become an Okhrana agent. Sudeykin came on 16 December accompanied by his nephew, another secret police officer, Nikolay (Koka) Sudovsky. Degayev invited Sudeykin to the bedroom to be introduced to the woman and in the passageway between the dining room and the bedroom, near the watercloset, shot him in the back. Mortally wounded, Sudeykin cried to his nephew: \"Koka, take your gun and help me!\" But Koka ran out of the apartment. While he was struggling with the locks trying to open the door Konashevich came from behind and with several blows of a crowbar cracked Sudovsky's skull. Unexpectedly Sudeykin was able to stand up and walk to the dining room. There he was shot by Starodvorsky. Degayev (and later Konashevich) ran away from the apartment without waiting for the end of the ordeal. Degayev was sure that his accomplices had been ordered to kill him after Sudeykin was killed. The gunshots and cries were heard all across the building; however, when the concierge reported to the local police they told him that they had instructions not to interfere with the apartment whatever happened there. The apartment was searched only the next day after Sudeykin's servant reported that his master had not returned at the expected hour. Rushing to the apartment police found the dying Koka and dead Sudeykin.[16]/nAll the posts in the Empire were plastered with posters showing Degayev's photographs and announcing 5000 roubles for information as to his whereabouts and 10,000 roubles for help in catching him. Still the conspirators had a good lead on their hunters and successfully arrived in Paris. At a winter 1884 meeting, Narodnaya Volya, led by V. A. Karaulov, Lev Tikhomirov and German Lopatin, fulfilled its end of the bargain and granted Degayev his life on the condition that he never again appear in the Russian Empire.[16] Lev Tikhomirov personally verified that he boarded a steamship bound for South America.[3]/nFrom South America Degayev moved to the United States; there he joined his wife, Lyubov Degayeva. His brother, Vladimir Degayev, who worked at the time in a Russian consulate in the United States and moonlighted as a foreign correspondent for a few Russian publications printed an article claiming that Sergey Degayev was killed in New Zealand, discouraging searches for him by both Russian police and Russian revolutionaries.[3]/nBoth Vladimir and Sergey Degayevs were registered in the USA under the name Polevoi after their maternal grandfather Nikolai Polevoy.[3][17] After his naturalization Alexander (Sergey) took the name Alexander Pell and his wife took the name Emma Pell.[17] At first they were poor; Sergey worked as a stevedore and as an unskilled labourer while his wife worked as a cook and a laundress.  In 1895 Alexander was enrolled into a PhD program in Johns Hopkins University with majors in mathematics and astronomy and a minor in English.[17] During his study he was financially supported by his wife who continued to work as a cook.[3] He received his doctorate in 1897 for the dissertation On the Focal surfaces of the Congruences of Tangents to a Given Surface.[1]/nThe University of South Dakota was established in the frontier town of Vermillion and started its classes in 1882. In 1897 they decided that they needed a professor of mathematics. They asked Professor L. S. Hulburt from Johns Hopkins if he could suggest a suitable candidate. He replied that he \"could suggest a first class mathematician who had the disadvantage of having a strong Russian brogue\". The reply from South Dakota was \"Send your Russian mathematician along, brogue and all\".[1][17]/nAlexander Pell was immensely popular among his students who referred to him as the \"class father\" and \"Jolly Little Pell\" (who could \"crack jokes faster than the freshmen could crack nuts\").[1] He was a good researcher, a member of the American Mathematical Society and the author of many journal publications. He was also an accomplished administrator who organized the School of Engineering of the University of South Dakota and became its first Dean (1905).[1]/nAlexander Pell had a habit of providing financial support from his own resources, and providing accommodation in his house to a few of his students. One such student was Anna Johnson, the future accomplished mathematician Anna Johnson Pell Wheeler.[3] Anna Johnson received her A.B. degree under Pell's supervision in 1903 and continued her study at the University of Iowa and then at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. In 1904 Emma Pell died.  Three years later Alexander Pell went to G\u00f6ttingen and married Anna in July 1907. They both returned to Vermillion where Anna taught classes in the theory of functions and differential equations and Alexander was the Dean of Engineering. In 1908 Pell resigned from the University of South Dakota and went with Anna to Chicago. There Anna completed her doctorate under E. H. Moore, while Pell took a position at the Armour Institute of Engineering (currently Illinois Institute of Technology). In 1911 Pell suffered a stroke and was unable to work thereafter.

Within the framework of this \"Operation Torch\", their planned intervention consists in neutralizing the armed forces and the administration loyal to the Vichy regime, temporarily paralyzing the entire organization of military defense and civil powers in Algeria, arresting its leaders and by interrupting local communications and with the outside, following a strategy developed by Lieutenant-Colonel Jousse, local major in Algiers, using by diverting it, the \"M.O.\" plan, a plan for maintaining order in the event of an alert previously drawn up to entrust the Legionary Order Service with emergency powers./nTwelve groups are formed.

The Brudno brothers,[14] Laurent Preziosi and three men more will provide them on the evening of the 7th with 200 cartridges of explosives from the construction site of the main sewer collector, quickly mounted in the manner of the Spanish dinamiteros, to make up for the insufficiency of their armament./nBut the deadlines are short, and the means uncertain to reach the 55 participants planned, often circumspect or pusillanimous. Numerous defections will reduce them to 19,[15] as well as many of their actions, for lack of staff, such as the capture of the police station in the 7th arrondissement, which was to be their command post, the shutdown of the Civic Center of the Legionary Order Service or the release of prisoners from the Maison Carr\u00e9e civil prison, suitable for providing recruits.

In 1939, an annual scholarship from the Arconati-Visconti fund was granted to him by the Faculty of Sciences to work on a thesis on probabilities, which the declaration of war was to interrupt. Returning to Algiers after the debacle, appointed to the rectorate and charged on 19 September 1940 with teaching mathematics at the start of the school year at the Lyc\u00e9e de Gar\u00e7ons d'Alger, he was suspended on 19 November 1940, and participated in the creation of schools. quickly opened to accommodate Jewish pupils, high school students, students and teachers excluded from public education, to whom he also gives lessons.

In January 1799 he was licensed as a preacher of the gospel by the St Andrews presbytery. In May 1803, after attending further courses of lectures at the University of Edinburgh, and acting as assistant to the professor of mathematics at St Andrews, he was ordained as minister of Kilmany, about 9 miles from the university town, where he continued to lecture.[5][6]  Kilmany was a small and predominantly agricultural parish, with a population under 800 in 1811.[7]/nChalmers made an issue within the University of St Andrews of the quality of mathematics teaching. It came to involve attacks on John Rotheram, the professor of natural philosophy.[8] His mathematical lectures roused enthusiasm, but they were discontinued by order of the authorities. Chalmers then opened mathematical classes on his own account which attracted many students; at the same time he delivered a course of lectures on chemistry, and ministered to his parish at Kilmany.

He considered that parochial organizations had not kept pace in the city with the growing population. He declared that twenty new churches, with parishes, should be erected in Glasgow; and he set to work to revive the old parochial economy of Scotland. The town council agreed to build one new church, attaching to it a parish of 10,000 persons, mostly weavers, labourers and factory workers, and this church was offered to Chalmers.[10]/nIn September 1819 he became minister of the church and parish of St John, where of 2000 families more than 800 had no connection with any Christian church. He first addressed himself to providing schools for the children. Two school-houses with four endowed teachers were established, where 700 children were taught, at moderate fees. Between 40 and 50 local Sabbath schools were opened, where more than 1000 children were taught. The parish was divided into 25 districts with 60 to 100 families. Chalmers was the centre of the whole system, visiting families and holding evening meetings.[10]/nIn 1823 Chalmers accepted the chair of moral philosophy at the University of St Andrews, the seventh academic offer made to him during his eight years in Glasgow.

He also introduced text-books.[10]/nIn 1834 Chalmers was elected fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and in the same year he became corresponding member of the Institute of France; in 1835 Oxford conferred on him the degree of DCL.[10] At this time he was living at 3 Forres Street on the Moray Estate in the west end of Edinburgh.[14]/nIn 1834 he became leader of the evangelical section of the Scottish Church in the General Assembly. He was appointed chairman of a committee for church extension, and in that capacity made a tour through a large part of Scotland, addressing presbyteries and holding public meetings. He also issued numerous appeals, with the result that in 1841, when he resigned his office as convener of the church extension committee, he was able to announce that in seven years upwards of \u00a3300,000 had been contributed, and 220 new churches had been built. His efforts to induce the Whig government to assist in this effort were unsuccessful.[10]/nIn 1840 Chalmers was unsuccessful in applying for the chair of divinity at the University of Glasgow. It went to the Moderate Alexander Hill.[15]/nChalmers found himself at the head of the party in the Church of Scotland which stood for \"non-intrusionism\": the principle that no minister should be intruded into any parish contrary to the will of the congregation. Cases of conflict between the church and the civil power arose in Auchterarder, Dunkeld and Marnoch. The courts made it clear that the Church, in their opinion, held its temporalities on condition of rendering such obedience as the courts required. The Church then appealed to the government for relief.[10] In political manoeuvres with Westminster politicians, Chalmers was opposed by John Hope.[16]/nIn January 1843 the government put a final negative on the church's claims for spiritual independence. The non-intrusionist movement ended in the Disruption: on 18 May 1843, 470 clergy withdrew from the general assembly and constituted themselves the Free Church of Scotland, with Chalmers as moderator. He had prepared a sustentation fund scheme for the support of the seceding ministers.[10]/nIn 1844, Chalmers announced a church extension campaign, for new building.[17] In 1846 he became the first principal of the Divinity Hall of the Free Church of Scotland, as it was initially called.[18]/nLater in life he was quoted as saying: \"Who cares about the Free Church compared with the Christian good of the people of Scotland? Who cares for any Church, but as an instrument of Christian good?\"[19]/nOn 28 May 1847 Chalmers returned to his house at Church Hill[20] in Morningside, near Edinburgh, from a journey to London on the subject of national education. On the following day (Saturday) he was employed in preparing a report to the General Assembly of the Free Church, then sitting. On Sunday, the 30th, he continued in his usual health and spirits, and retired to rest with the intention of rising at an early hour to finish his report. The next morning he did not make his appearance, and he was discovered lying dead in bed.[10]/nChalmers was interred in the Grange Cemetery on 4 June, the very first burial in that cemetery.[21] His grave is on the north wall, near the north-west access. A large crowd of persons of all denominations accompanied his remains to the grave.[22] His wife Grace Pratt died 16 January 1850 and is buried with him, as is his daughter Grace Pratt Chalmers (1819\u20131851) and two of his other six daughters. James Sievewright, the moderator on the year he died, preached a eulogy.[23]/nChalmers's academic years resulted in a prolific literature of various kinds: his writings fill more than 30 volumes.[10] Contemporaries regarded him highly as a natural theologian. A series of sermons on the relation between the discoveries of astronomy and the Christian revelation was published in January 1817, and within a year nine editions and 20,000 copies were in circulation.[5]/nIn 1808 Chalmers published an Inquiry into the Extent and Stability of National Resources, a contribution to the discussion created by Bonaparte's commercial policy.[5]/nAs a political economist he first dealt with: the relationship between the degree of the fertility of the soil and the social condition of a community; capital accumulation;[24] and the general doctrine of a limit to all the modes by which national wealth may accumulate. He was the first also to advance that argument in favour of religious establishments which met on its own ground the doctrine of Adam Smith, that religion\u2014like other things\u2014should be left to the operation of the law of supply and demand.[25]/nIn 1826 he published a third volume of The Christian and Civic Economy of Large Towns, a continuation of work begun at St John's, Glasgow.[26] In 1832 he published a Political Economy, the chief purpose of which was to argue that the right economic condition of the masses is dependent on their right moral condition, so that character is the parent of comfort, not vice versa.[10]/nParochial machinery gave Chalmers experience in dealing with the problem of poor relief.[10] He became an influential thinker on poverty. Chalmers was a Malthusian in his belief that the cause of pauperism was the poor having too many children. He also thought that poor-relief officials should be tenured and business-like; and voluntary taxation was the correct way to support poor relief.[27]/nWhen Chalmers undertook the management of the parish of St John's, the poor of the parish cost the city \u00a31400 per annum, and in four years the pauper expenditure was reduced to \u00a3280 per annum. The investigation of new applications for relief was given to the deacon of the district, and an effort was made to enable the poor to help themselves. At this time there were few parishes north of the Forth and Clyde where there was a compulsory assessment for the poor, but the English method of assessment was spreading. Chalmers opposed compulsory assessment as counter-productive, and believed that relief should instead be raised and administered by voluntary means.[10] It has been argued that Chalmers was both a paternalist, on the moral plane, and a supporter of economic individualism.[28]/nCritics replied to Chalmers that his approach was impossible in large cities.[10] William Pulteney Alison engaged in controversy with him;[29] Chalmers countered with moral arguments.[30] In arguing that private charity should outweigh public expenditure in relieving poverty, he was one of a group of British writers of the period of similar views, that included also Samuel Richard Bosanquet, Thomas Mozley and Frederick Oakeley.[31] The views from Chalmers and Edinburgh had a notable effect in Wales, through Lewis Edwards, Y Traethodydd, and Owen Thomas.[32]/nIn his St Andrews lectures Chalmers excluded mental philosophy and included the whole sphere of moral obligation, dealing with man's duty to God and to his fellow-men in the light of Christian teaching. Many of his lectures were printed in the first and second volumes of his published works.[10]/nIn the field of ethics he made contributions in regard to the place and functions of volition and attention, the separate and underived character of the moral sentiments, and the distinction between the virtues of perfect and imperfect obligation.[10]/nAt his own request the article on Christianity was assigned to him in David Brewster's Edinburgh Encyclop\u00e6dia. The separate publication of this article, and contributions to the Edinburgh Christian Instructor and The Eclectic Review, enhanced his reputation as an author.[5]/nChalmers's writings are a source for argument and illustration on the question of Establishment.  \"I have no veneration\", he said to the royal commissioners in St Andrews, before either the voluntary or the non-intrusive controversies had arisen, \"for the Church of Scotland qua an establishment, but I have the utmost veneration for it qua an instrument of Christian good.\"[10]/nChalmers' Bridgewater Treatise, in the series On the Power, Wisdom and Goodness of God as Manifested in the Adaptation of External Nature to the Moral and Intellectual Constitution of Man, appeared in two volumes 1833 and went through 6 editions.[33] As noted by Robert M. Young, these books effectively represent an encyclopedia of pre-evolutionary natural history, commissioned and published whilst Charles Darwin was on board the Beagle./nIn the area of natural theology and the Christian evidences he advocated the method of reconciling the Mosaic narrative with the indefinite antiquity of the globe which William Buckland advanced in his Bridgewater Treatises, and which Chalmers had previously communicated to him.[25]/nIn 1814 Chalmers lectured on the concept of gap creationism, also known as the \"gap theory\", and subsequently spread its popularity of this idea which he credited to Episcopius. He wrote of Genesis 1:1: \"My own opinion, as published in 1814, is that it forms no part of the first day but refers to a period of indefinite antiquity when God created the worlds out of nothing. The commencement of the first day's work I hold to be the moving of God's Spirit upon the face of the waters. We can allow geology the amplest time\u00a0... without infringing even on the literalities of the Mosaic record.\"[34]/nThis form of old Earth creationism posits that the six-day creation, as described in the Book of Genesis, involved literal 24-hour days, but that there was a gap of time between two distinct creations in the first and the second verses of Genesis, explaining many scientific observations, including the age of the Earth.[35][36][37] Gap creationism differs from day-age creationism (which posits that the \"days\" of creation were much longer periods - of thousands or millions of years), and from young Earth creationism (which although it agrees concerning the six literal 24-hour days of creation, does not posit any gap of time)./nThe \"New College\", as the Divinity School became known, was a centre of opposition to the Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844). Chalmers himself did not mention the work, but indirectly attacked its view of development in writing for the North British Review.[38]/nChalmers' eldest daughter Anne married William Hanna, who wrote a long biography of his father-in-law.[39]/nHis brother, Charles Chalmers, founded the Merchiston Castle School. Charles' son, David (Thomas' nephew) was a noted industrialist and owner of the Cowan & Co. paperworks.[4]/nAttributio", "52819449": "Douglas Ulmer is an American mathematician who works in algebraic geometry and number theory.[1] He is a professor and mathematics department head at the University of Arizona.[2]/nUlmer did his undergraduate study at Princeton University.[3] In 1987, he received his PhD at Brown University, where his advisor was Benedict Hyman Gross; his thesis was titled The Arithmetic of Universal Elliptic Modular Curves.[4]/nUlmer was a C.

He was responsible for crucial advances in aerodynamics characterizing supersonic and hypersonic airflow. The human-defined threshold of outer space is named the \"K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line\" in recognition of his work. K\u00e1rm\u00e1n is regarded as an outstanding aerodynamic theoretician of the 20th century.[3][4][5]/nTheodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n was born into a Jewish family in Budapest, Austria-Hungary, as K\u00e1rm\u00e1n T\u00f3dor, the son of Helene (Konn or Kohn, Hungarian: Kohn Ilka) and M\u00f3r K\u00e1rm\u00e1n\u00a0[eo].[1] Among his ancestors were Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel, who was said to be the creator of the Golem of Prague, and Rabbi Moses ben Menachem Mendel Kunitz\u00a0[hu; he], who wrote about Zohar.[1] His father, M\u00f3r, was a well-known educator, who reformed the Hungarian school system and founded Minta Gymnasium in Budapest. He became an influential figure and became a commissioner of the Ministry of Education,[6] and was responsible for \"planning an education of a young archduke, the Emperor's cousin\". In 1907 M\u00f3r Karman was ennobled, Theodore later described it:[7]/nTo receive a predicate of nobility, my father had to be landed. Fortunately he owned a small vineyard near Budapest, so the Emperor bestowed upon him the predicate \"von Sz\u0151ll\u0151skislaki\" (small grape). I have shortened it to von, for even to me, a Hungarian, the full title is almost unpronounceable.[7]/nTheodore had three brothers (among them Elem\u00e9r K\u00e1rm\u00e1n\u00a0[eo]) and one sister, Josephine. At age six, he could \"perform large mental calculations\",[8] for example multiplication of six-digit numbers.[7] Father discouraged Theodore's mathematical education, he was afraid that his son would be a child prodigy and a freak.[8] He was tutored by his father and his father's former student; later he entered the Minta Gymnasium in Budapest. He won E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Prize \"for the best student in mathematics and science in the whole of Hungary\" in his last year at Minta.[8][a]/nHe studied engineering at the city's Royal Joseph Technical University (Budapest University of Technology and Economics). He graduated in 1902 with a degree in mechanical engineering, his thesis was \"The motion of a heavy rod supported on its rounded end by a horizontal plane\". He then served a year as an artillery cadet in the Austro-Hungarian army.[8] In 1903-1906 he worked as an assistant at the Royal Joseph Technical University. In 1906 he moved to the German Empire and joined Ludwig Prandtl at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where he received his doctorate in 1908, for his research on \"mathematical models for the buckling of large structures\".[8] He taught at G\u00f6ttingen for four years. In 1913 he accepted a position as director of the Aeronautical Institute at RWTH Aachen University, a leading German university. His time at RWTH Aachen was interrupted by service in the Austro-Hungarian Army from 1915 to 1918, during the World War I, when he designed the Petr\u00f3czy-K\u00e1rm\u00e1n-\u017durovec, an early helicopter.[8]/nAfter the war, in 1919, he returned to Aachen with his mother and sister Josephine. Some of his students took an interest in gliding and saw the competitions of the Rh\u00f6n-Rossitten Gesellschaft as an opportunity to advance in aeronautics. K\u00e1rm\u00e1n engaged Wolfgang Klemperer to design a competitive glider.[10]/nJosephine encouraged her brother Theodore to expand his science beyond national boundaries. They organized the first international conference in mechanics held in September 1922 in Innsbruck. Subsequent conferences were organized as the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics.[11]/nIn 1926, Karman was first invited to the USA by the California Institute of Technology to build a wind tunnel.[12][8] In 1930 he was invited for a position of a full-time director of the Aeronautical Laboratory at California Institute of Technology; his mother and sister, Josephine, also moved to California.[8]/nApprehensive about developments in Europe regarding Nazism, in 1930 K\u00e1rm\u00e1n accepted the directorship of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology (GALCIT).[12] The directorship included provision for a research assistant, and he selected Frank Wattendorf, an American who had been studying for three years in Aachen.[13]/nAnother student Ernest Edwin Sechler took up the problem of making reliable airframes for aircraft, and with K\u00e1rm\u00e1n's support, developed an understanding of aeroelasticity./nIn 1936, K\u00e1rm\u00e1n engaged the legal services of Andrew G. Haley to form the Aerojet Corporation, with his graduate student Frank Malina and their experimental rocketry collaborators Jack Parsons and Edward Forman to manufacture JATO rocket motors. K\u00e1rm\u00e1n later became a naturalized citizen of the United States./nIn 1940, K\u00e1rm\u00e1n was selected by John M. Carmody, Administrator of the Federal Works Agency to be on the Board of Engineers tasked with investigating the November 7, 1940 collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge outside Tacoma, Washington. His expertise was instrumental in discovering the effect of aerodynamic forces on the bridge, causing its unusual \"galloping\" behavior and eventual collapse. Along with Civil Engineers Othmar Amman and Glenn B. Woodruff, he published the report \"The Failure of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge\"[14] on March 28, 1941./nGerman activity during World War II increased US military interest in rocket research. In early 1943, the Experimental Engineering Division of the United States Army Air Forces Material Command forwarded to K\u00e1rm\u00e1n reports from British intelligence sources describing German rockets capable of travelling more than 100 miles (160\u00a0km). In a letter dated 2 August 1943 K\u00e1rm\u00e1n provided the Army with his analysis of and comments on the German program.[15]/nIn 1944 he and others affiliated with GALCIT founded the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which is now a federally funded research and development center managed and operated by Caltech under a contract from NASA. In 1946 he became the first chairman of the Scientific Advisory Group which studied aeronautical technologies for the United States Army Air Forces. He also helped found AGARD, the NATO aerodynamics research oversight group (1951), the International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences (1956), the International Academy of Astronautics (1960), and the Von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics in Sint-Genesius-Rode, south of Brussels (1956)./nHe eventually became an important figure in supersonic motion, noting in a seminal paper that aeronautical engineers were \"pounding hard on the closed door leading into the field of supersonic motion.\"[16]/nIn June 1944, von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n underwent surgery for intestinal cancer in New York City. The surgery caused two hernias, and K\u00e1rm\u00e1n's recovery was slow. Early in September, while still in New York, he met US Army Air Forces Commanding General Henry H. Arnold on a runway at LaGuardia Airport, and Arnold then proposed that K\u00e1rm\u00e1n should move to Washington, D.C. to lead the Scientific Advisory Group and become a long-range planning consultant to the military. K\u00e1rm\u00e1n returned to Pasadena around mid-September, was appointed to the SAG position on October 23, 1944, and left Caltech in December 1944.[17]/nAt the age of 81 K\u00e1rm\u00e1n was the recipient of the first National Medal of Science, bestowed in a White House ceremony by President John F. Kennedy. He was recognized, \"For his leadership in the science and engineering basic to aeronautics; for his effective teaching and related contributions in many fields of mechanics, for his distinguished counsel to the Armed Services, and for his promoting international cooperation in science and engineering.\"[18]/nK\u00e1rm\u00e1n never married. He died on a trip to Aachen, West Germany, in 1963, five days short of his 82nd birthday,[19] and his body was returned to the United States to be entombed in the Beth Olam Mausoleum at what is now the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.[20] He has sometimes been described as one of The Martians.[21]/nK\u00e1rm\u00e1n's fame was in the use of mathematical tools to study fluid flow,[22] and the interpretation of those results to guide practical designs. He was instrumental in recognizing the importance of swept-back wings ubiquitous in modern jet aircraft./nSpecific contributions include theories of non-elastic buckling, unsteady wakes in circum-cylinder flow, stability of laminar flow, turbulence, airfoils in steady and unsteady flow, boundary layers, and supersonic aerodynamics. He made additional contributions in other fields, including elasticity, vibration, heat transfer, and crystallography. His name also appears in a number of concepts, for example:/nFour years after K\u00e1rm\u00e1n died his autobiography The Wind and Beyond was published by Lee Edson with Little, Brown and Company. Seven major academic journals then followed with book reviews by noted authors: As the book was non-technical, written for the general reader, Thomas P. Hughes[23] cited that as problematic given the technical context of K\u00e1rm\u00e1n's work. Hughes conceded that K\u00e1rm\u00e1n \"exhibited a genius for finding the simplifying assumptions that made possible the mathematical analysis.\" While acknowledging K\u00e1rm\u00e1n's gifts as an applied mathematician and teacher, Stanley Corrsin points out that the autobiography is \"marriage between a man and his ego.\" In the later part of his life, K\u00e1rm\u00e1n was a \"planner of global symposia and societies\" and a \"consultant to the upper echelons of the Pentagon corps.\"[24]/nOn creativity, K\u00e1rm\u00e1n wrote \"the finest creative thought comes not out of organized teams but out of the quiet of one's own world.\"[10]:\u200a307\u200a In his review[25] I. B. Holley noted \"penetrating insights into the creative process, its ingredients, nurture and exploitation.\" According to Holley, K\u00e1rm\u00e1n was given to \"convivial drinking and the company of beautiful women.\"/nAn enthusiastic review by J. Kestin[26] advised readers to buy and study the book, and prize it as a reference. On the other hand, Charles S\u00fcsskind[27] faults K\u00e1rm\u00e1n for his contempt for the conventional (gaminarie). S\u00fcsskind expected the book to show some reaction to Wernher von Braun's coming to America, and some clarification of the Hsue-shen Tsien affair, rather than \"lapses into generalities\". S\u00fcsskind also tags K\u00e1rm\u00e1n as a militarist: a \"forthright engineer who is quite unabashed about his lifelong association with military authorities in whatever country he happened to reside at the time.\"/nSydney Goldstein, who also wrote the Royal Society memoir for K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, reviewed the autobiography[28] and remembered \"an eminent engineer and scientist, warm-hearted and witty, much traveled, well-known by many, devoted to international collaboration, who, in his own words, as a scientist found the military 'the most comfortable group to deal with'\".", "20280849": "Andr\u00e9 Haefliger (Swiss Standard German pronunciation: [\u02c8andre\u02d0 \u02c8h\u025b\u02d0fl\u026a\u0261\u0259r]; 22 May 1929\u00a0\u2013 7 March 2023) was a Swiss mathematician who worked primarily on topology./nHaefliger went to school in Nyon and then attended his final years at Coll\u00e8ge de Gen\u00e8ve in Geneva.

Some of his most notable contributions are listed below./nIn the early 1980s, Feichtinger introduced modulation spaces, a family of function spaces defined by the behavior of the short-time Fourier transform with respect to a test function from the Schwartz space. They have become the standard spaces in time-frequency analysis. Also, while the concept of function spaces treating local and global behavior separately was already known earlier, Wiener amalgam spaces were introduced by Feichtinger in 1980, also his publications have contributed to the acknowledgment of amalgam spaces as a useful tool in various mathematical fields./nAround 1990 the joint research with Karlheinz Gr\u00f6chenig lead to a series of papers, which is today referred to as coorbit theory. The theory provides a unified framework for different important transforms, e.g. the wavelet transform and the short-time Fourier transform./nFeichtinger also proposed the use of Banach Gelfand triples, especially the Banach Gelfand triple \n\n\n\n\nS\n\n0\n\n\n\u2282\n\nL\n\n2\n\n\n\u2282\n\nS\n\n0\n\n\u2032\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S_{0}\\subset L^{2}\\subset S_{0}'}\n\n that has proven very useful, e.g. in time-frequency analysis./nFeichtinger once raised the question, whether/nThe question is now widely referred to as Feichtinger's conjecture, a term first used by Peter G.

He was a committed educator, and an early proponent of professionalization in the teaching of advanced mathematics in America. A professor and Chairman of the Mathematics Department in Cornell University's College of Arts & Sciences, McMahon was one of the earliest members of the American Mathematical Society (as the predecessor New York Mathematical Society) in 1891. For seven years he served as associate editor of the Annals of Mathematics. He was also the American Association for the Advancement of Science's Secretary (1897), Section A (Mathematics and Astronomy); General Secretary (1898), and Vice-President (1901). McMahon was also featured in the publication, American Men (and Women) of Science.[1]/nProfessor McMahon was born in County Armagh, Ireland on April 22, 1856, the son of Robert McMahon and Mary Hewitt.[2] He took up general studies in the Classical Program at Trinity College, Dublin in 1879. By completion of studies, McMahon was ranked among the first members of the class of 1881 and took highest honors in Metaphysics and Classical Studies.  McMahon had been awarded the Wray Prize in 1880. The honor was created from a gift of Mrs. Catherine Wray in 1848, spouse to the late Reverend Henry Wray, D.D., Vice Provost of Trinity and Senior Fellow, to encourage Metaphysical studies. The second prize taken by McMahon was Trinity's Brooke Prize for Classical Studies.  He graduated A.B. with two gold medals from Dublin in 1881, receiving the degree of A.M. in 1890 and the honorary D.Sc. in 1918.   McMahon arrived in Ithaca, New York in January 1883.[3]  His initial introduction to Cornell University was as an examiner in the Mathematics Department and as an instructor for Andrew Dickson White's \u201cCorrespondence University\u201d, a distance learning initiative of 1883.[4]/nIn 1884, James McMahon became a Cornell instructor, in 1890 an assistant professor, and in 1904 a member of the Cornell Faculty as professor of mathematics. He was one of the two most prominent Cornell mathematicians of this early period\u2013the other one being James Oliver.[5] In 1893 McMahon helped to found the Sigma Xi Society.  The idea was to create the Phi Beta Kappa of the sciences, a concession that the literary and arts focused Phi Beta Kappa Society was perceived as being tied to an older collegiate focus antedating the rise of science and engineering in the university curriculum. The First Convention of Sigma Xi was held at Cornell University.  McMahon was a delegate from Cornell University; Ernest G. Merritt represented the University of Kansas. McMahon's focus was on the policy by which the society would expand.[6] He also served as vice president (1905) and President (1909) of the Theta Chapter, Phi Beta Kappa, and was succeeded by Madison Bentley (1909) and Alfred Hayes, Jr. (1910).[7] On June 26, 1890, James McMahon married into Cornell University's Crane family. He was spouse to Katharine Crane, sister to Professor \u201cTeeFee\u201d Crane. Five years later, the chairman of the Cornell Mathematics Department, Professor William Oliver, died. The university leased the Oliver cottage at 7 Central Avenue, and adjacent to Professor Crane's cottage, to the McMahons. James McMahon lived on Central Avenue from 1895 until his death in 1922./nIn the history of applied mathematics, McMahon's most significant contribution came late in life and was published posthumously. In 1902, McMahon had delivered an address to the Section on Mathematics and Astronomy, American Association for the Advancement of Science, then assembled at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, entitled \u201cSome Recent Applications of the Function Theory to Physical Problems\u201d.[8] His work in the field of geometry had taken an \u201capplied\u201d direction, seeking those instances were the abstract theories of his discipline could be applied to the daily problems addressed by scientists and engineers.  As theoretical statistics developed into a modern discipline, its practitioners were using geometrical representation in their presentations. The cross pollination of statistics with geometry led to increased interest in geometric theory.  Professor Karl Pearson proposed that a specialist in geometry work out the trigonometry of higher-dimensioned plane space for all the relations between multiple correlation and partial correlation coefficients when variates are properties of the angles, edges and perpendiculars of sphero-polyhedron multiple space.  A pure mathematician was needed to write, in effect, a treatise on \u201cSpherical Polyhedrometry.\u201d[9]  McMahon took up Pearson's charge as he was entering emeritus status.  The Carnegie Institute had granted him a retirement annuity allowing him to step down as Chair of Cornell's Mathematics Department and spend his final years focused on new developments in the field.  Renting a cottage in Key West, Florida, Professor McMahon and spouse Katherine Crane McMahon spent the Ithaca winter down in the Caribbean, while the professor worked on the new \u201cSpherical Polyhedrometry\u201d.  The results were published the year after McMahon's death as the paper Hyperspherical Geometry; and its Application to Correlation Theory for N Variables.[10]/nIn 1916, McMahon took a public position on the re-election campaign of President Woodrow Wilson.  While Chair of the Mathematics Department at Cornell University, Professor McMahon supplied the Democratic National Committee with three reasons to favor Wilson.  Chief among McMahon's reasons for supporting the President were Wilson's advocacy on behalf of international law in the face of strong domestic opposition; Wilson's opposition to the de facto, at the expense of a de jure,  government of Mexico; and Wilson's success in advancing \u201c. . . many positive constructive and forward-looking achievements . . . as well as its enlightened Americanism . . . .\u201d[11]  McMahon took sabbatic leave in academic year 1920\u20131921.

Rallis then adapted the classical idea of doubling a quadratic space to create the \"Piatetski\u2013Shapiro and Rallis Doubling Method\" for constructing integral representations of L-functions, and thus they obtained the first general result on L-functions for all classical groups.[6]  The 1990 Wolf Prize to Piatetski\u2013Shapiro [7] cites this work with Rallis as one of Piatetski\u2013Shapiro's main achievements. Whereas it had previously been assumed that all the L-functions constructed by the Rankin\u2013Selberg integral method were a subset of those constructed by the Langlands\u2013Shahidi method, the 1992 paper by Rallis with Piatetski-Shapiro and Schiffmann on the Rankin\u2013Selberg integrals for the group G_2 showed this was not the case and opened the way for determining many new examples of L-functions represented by Rankin\u2013Selberg integrals.[8]/nThe L-functions studied by Rallis are important because of their connections with the Langlands functoriality conjecture.

Their automorphic descent method constructs an explicit inverse map to the (standard) Langlands functorial lift and has had major applications to the analysis of functoriality.[9]  Also, using the \"Rallis tower property\" [10] from his 1984 paper on the Howe duality conjecture, Rallis with Ginzburg and Soudry studied global exceptional correspondences and found new examples of functorial lifts./nIn 1990, Rallis gave an invited address on his work \"Poles of Standard L-functions\" at the 1990 International Congress of Mathematicians in Kyoto.[11] In 2003, the conference \"Automorphic Representations, L-Functions and Applications: Progress and Prospects\" was held in honor of Rallis's 60th birthday [12] and according to the conference proceedings, \"reflects the depth and breadth of Rallis's influence\".

As a pioneer of modern control theory and electronic telecommunications he revolutionized both the content and methodology of his chosen fields of research. His synergy with Claude Shannon, the father of information theory, laid the foundations for the technological convergence of the information age./nHe made important contributions to the design, guidance and control of anti-aircraft systems during World War II. He helped develop the automatic artillery weapons that defended London from the V-1 flying bombs during WWII. After the war, Bode along with his wartime rival Wernher von Braun, developer of the V-2 rocket, and, later, the father of the US space program, served as members of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), the predecessor of NASA. During the Cold War, he contributed to the design and control of missiles and anti-ballistic missiles.[2]/nHe also made important contributions to control systems theory and mathematical tools for the analysis of stability of linear systems, inventing Bode plots, gain margin and phase margin./nBode was one of the great engineering philosophers of his era.[3] Long respected in academic circles worldwide,[4][5] he is also widely known to modern engineering students mainly for developing the asymptotic magnitude and phase plot that bears his name, the Bode plot./nHis research contributions in particular were not only multidimensional but also far reaching, extending as far as the U.S. space program.[6][7][8]/nBode was born in Madison, Wisconsin. His father was a professor of education, and a faculty member  at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign by the time young Hendrik was ready for elementary school. He entered Leal Elementary School and rapidly advanced through the Urbana school system to graduate from high school at the age of 14.[1][9]/nImmediately after graduation from high school he applied for admission to the University of Illinois but was denied because of his age. Decades later, in 1977, the same university would grant him an honorary Sc.D. degree.[1]/nHe eventually applied and was accepted at Ohio State University, where his father also taught, and he received his BA degree in 1924, at age 19, and his M.A. degree in 1926, both in Mathematics.[10] After receiving his M.A. he remained at his alma mater, working as a teaching assistant, for an additional year.[1]/nFresh from graduate school he was promptly hired by Bell Labs in New York City, where he began his career as designer of electronic filters and equalizers.[11] Subsequently, in 1929, he was assigned to the Mathematical Research Group,[12] where he excelled in research related to electronic networks theory and its application to telecommunications. Sponsored by Bell Laboratories he reentered graduate school, this time at Columbia University, and he successfully completed his PhD in physics in 1935.[13][14][15]/nIn 1938,[16] he developed asymptotic phase and magnitude plots, now known as Bode plots, which displayed the frequency response of systems clearly. His work on automatic (feedback) control systems introduced innovative methods to the study of system stability that enabled engineers to investigate time-domain stability using the frequency-domain concepts of gain and phase margin, the study of which was aided by his now famous plots.[17][16]\nIn essence, his method made stability transparent to both the time and frequency domains and, furthermore, his frequency-domain-based analysis was much faster and simpler than the traditional time-domain-based method. This provided engineers with a fast and intuitive stability analysis and system design tool that remains widely used today. He, along with Harry Nyquist, also developed the theoretical conditions applicable to the stability of amplifier circuits.[15]/nWith the inexorable onset of World War II, Bode turned his sights on the military applications of his control systems research, a change of direction that would last in varying degree to the end of his career. He came to the service of his country by working on the Director Project at Bell Labs[18] (funded by National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) Section D-2), developing automatic anti-aircraft control systems, whereby radar information was used to provide data about the location of the enemy aircraft, which was then fed back to the anti-aircraft artillery servomechanisms, enabling automatic, radar-augmented enemy aircraft ballistic tracking,[19] in other words, automatic shooting down of enemy aircraft with the help of radar. The servomotors used were both electrically and hydraulically powered, the latter being used mainly for positioning the heavy anti-aircraft guns.[18]/nThe radar signal was locked on target, and its data was wirelessly transmitted to a ground receiver that was connected to the artillery servomechanism feedback control system, causing the servo to accurately modify its angular position and maintain it for an optimal amount of time, long enough to fire at the calculated (predicted) coordinates of the target and thus successfully track the target.[18]/nThe prediction of the coordinates was the function of director T-10, a form of electrical computer so named because it was used to direct the positioning of the gun with respect to the airborne target.[18] It also calculated the target average velocity based on the location information provided by the radar and predicted the future target location based on its assumed flightpath equation, usually a linear function of time.[18] This system functioned as an early version of the  modern anti-ballistic missile defence model.[20] Statistical analysis was also employed to aid in the computation of the exact position of the enemy aircraft and to smooth the data acquired from the target due to signal fluctuations and noise effects.[18][21]/nBode therefore realized the first wireless data feedback loop in the history of automatic control systems by combining wireless data communications, electrical computers, statistics principles and feedback control systems theory. He showed his dry sense of humour by calling this multidisciplinary linkage a shotgun marriage,[6][22] referring to the antiaircraft artillery origins of his historic invention, saying: \"This, I said, was a sort of shotgun marriage forced upon us by the pressures of military problems in World War\u00a0II.\" He also described it further as \"a sort of 'shotgun marriage' between two incompatible personalities\" and characterised the product of that linkage as a \"son of shotgun marriage\".[23][24][25]/nThe product of this \"marriage\", i.e. the automated artillery gun, can also be considered as a robot weapon. Its function required to process data that was wirelessly transmitted to its sensors and make a decision based on the data received using its onboard computer about its output defined as its angular position and the timing of its firing mechanism. In this model we can see all the elements of later concepts such as data processing, automation, artificial intelligence, cybernetics, robotics etc./nBode, in addition, applied  his extensive skills with feedback amplifiers to design the target data smoothing and position predictor networks of an improved model of director T-10, called the director T-15. The work on director T-15 was undertaken under a new project at Bell Labs called Fundamental Director Studies in cooperation with the NDRC under the directorship of Walter McNair.[18]/nNDRC, the funding agency of this project, was operating under the aegis of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD).[26]/nHis NDRC-funded research at Bell Labs under the section D-2 (Control Systems section) contract eventually led to other important developments in related fields and laid the cornerstone for many present-day inventions. In the field of control theory, for example, it aided in the further development of servomechanism design and control, a crucial component of modern robotics. The development of wireless data communications theory by Bode led to later inventions such as mobile phones and wireless networking./nThe reason for the new project was that director T-10 encountered difficulties in calculating the target velocity by differentiating the target position. Due to discontinuities, variations and noise in the radar signal, the position derivatives sometimes fluctuated wildly, and this caused erratic motion in the servomechanisms of the gun because their control signal was based on the value of the derivatives.[18] This could be mitigated by smoothing or averaging out the data, but this caused delays in the feedback loop that enabled the target to escape.[18] As well, the algorithms of director T-10 required a number of transformations from Cartesian (rectangular) to polar coordinates and back to Cartesian, a process that introduced additional tracking errors.[18]/nBode designed the velocity computing networks of director T-15 by applying a finite difference method instead of differentiation.[18] Under this scheme the target positional coordinates were stored in a mechanical memory, usually a potentiometer or a cam.[18] The velocity was then calculated by taking the difference between the coordinates of the current position and the coordinates of the previous reading that were stored in memory and dividing by the difference of their respective times.[18] This method was more robust than the differentiation method, and it also smoothed out signal disturbances, since the finite time-step size was less sensitive to random signal impulses (spikes).[18] It also introduced for the first time an algorithm better suited to modern digital signal processing theory rather than to the classical calculus-based analog signal processing approach that was followed then. Not coincidentally it is an integral part of modern digital control theory and digital signal processing and is known as the backward difference algorithm.[27] In addition, the director T-15 operated only in rectangular coordinates, thus eliminating coordinate-transformation-based errors. These design innovations paid performance dividends, and the director T-15 was twice as accurate as its predecessor and converged on a target twice as fast.[18]/nThe fire control algorithm implementation of his artillery design research and his extensive work with feedback amplifiers advanced the state of the art in computational methods and led to the eventual development of the electronic analog computer,[28] the operational amplifier based alternative of today's digital computers./nInventions such as these, despite their military research origins, have had a profound and lasting impact in the civilian domain./nThe automated anti-aircraft guns that Bode helped develop were successfully used in numerous instances during the war. In February 1944, an automated fire control system based on the earlier version of the director T-15, called the director T-10 by Bell Labs or director M-9 by the military, saw action for the first time in Anzio, Italy, where it helped down over one hundred enemy aircraft. On D-day 39 units were deployed in Normandy to protect the allied invading force against Hitler's Luftwaffe.[18]/nPerhaps the menace best suited for the design specifications of such an automated artillery system appeared in June 1944. It was another robot. The German aeronautical engineers aided by Wernher von Braun produced a robot of their own: the V-1 flying bomb, an automatically guided bomb and widely considered a precursor of the cruise missile.[29][30] Its flight specifications almost perfectly suited the target design criteria of director T-10, that of an aircraft flying straight and level at constant velocity,[18] in other words a target nicely fitting the computing capabilities of a linear predictor model such as the director T-10. Although the Germans did have a trick up their engineering sleeve by making the bomb fly fast and low to evade radar, a technique widely adopted even today. During the London Blitz one hundred 90\u00a0mm automated gun units assisted by director T-10 were set up in a perimeter south of London, at the special request of Winston Churchill. The AA units included the SCR-584 radar unit produced by the Radiation Lab at MIT and the proximity fuse mechanism, developed by Merle Tuve and his special Division T at NDRC,[18] that detonated near the target using a microwave controlled fuse called the VT, or variable time fuse, enabling a larger detonation reach envelope and increasing the chances of a successful outcome. Between June 18 and July 17, 1944, 343 V-1 bombs were shot down, or 10% of the total V-1 number sent by the Germans and about 20% of the total V-1 bombs shot down. From July 17 to August 31 the automated gun kills rose to 1286 V-1 rockets, or 34%  of the total V-1 number dispatched from Germany and 50% of the V-1 actually shot down over London.[18] From these statistics it can be seen that the automated systems that Bode helped design had a considerable impact on crucial battles of World War\u00a0II.[31] It can also be seen that London at the time of the Blitz became, among other things, the original robot battlefield./nIn 1945, as the war was winding down, the NDRC was issuing a summary of technical reports as the prelude to its eventual closing down. Inside the volume on fire control a special essay titled Data Smoothing and Prediction in Fire-Control Systems, coauthored by Ralph Beebe Blackman, Hendrik Bode, and Claude Shannon, formally introduced the problem of fire control as a special case of transmission, manipulation and utilization of intelligence,[18][21] in other words, it modeled the problem in terms of data and signal processing and thus heralded the coming of the information age. Shannon, considered to be the father of information theory, was greatly influenced by this work.[18] It is clear that the technological convergence\nof the information age was preceded by the synergy between these scientific minds and their collaborators./nIn 1944, Bode was placed in charge of the Mathematical Research Group at Bell Laboratories.[32]/nHis work on electronic communications, especially on filter and equalizer design,[33] continued during this time. In 1945 it culminated in the publication of his book under the title of Network Analysis and Feedback Amplifier Design,[34] which is considered a classic in the field of electronic telecommunications and was extensively used as a textbook for many graduate programs at various universities, as well as for internal training courses at Bell Labs.[35]\nHe was also the prolific author of many research papers that were published in prestigious scientific and technical journals./nIn 1948, President Harry S. Truman awarded him the President's Certificate of Merit, in recognition of his remarkable scientific contributions to the war effort and to the United States of America.[14]/nAs the war came to an end, his research focus shifted to include not only military but civilian research projects as well. On the military side he continued pursuing ballistic missile research, including research on antiballistic missile defence and associated computing algorithms, and in the civilian domain he concentrated on modern communication theory. On the post-war military research front he worked on the Nike Zeus missile project as part of a team with Douglas Aircraft,[15] and later on the design of anti-ballistic missiles.[2]/nIn 1952, he was promoted to the level of director of mathematical research at Bell Labs. In 1955, he became director of research in the physical sciences, and remained there until 1958, when he was promoted again to become one of the two vice presidents in charge of military development and systems engineering, a position he held up to his retirement.[10][15] He also became a director of Bellcomm, a company associated with the Apollo program.[15]/nHis applied research at Bell Labs over the years led to numerous patented inventions, some of which were registered in his name. By the time of his retirement he held a total of 25 patents in various areas of electrical and communications engineering, including signal amplifiers and artillery control systems.[1]/nHe retired from Bell Labs in October 1967, at the age of 61, ending an association that spanned more than four decades and changed the face of many of the core elements of modern engineering./nSoon after retirement, Bode was elected to the academically prestigious Gordon McKay Professor of Systems Engineering position  at Harvard University.[36]/nDuring his tenure there, he pursued research on military decision making algorithms and optimization techniques based on stochastic processes that are considered a precursor of modern fuzzy logic.[37]\nHe also studied the effects of technology on modern society and taught courses on the same subject at Harvard's Science and Public Policy Seminar, while supervising and teaching undergraduate and graduate students at the same time in the division of Engineering and Applied Physics.[36]/nAlthough his professorial duties were demanding of his time, he kept a keen eye on leaving his research legacy. He was simultaneously working on a new book that expounded on his extensive experience as a researcher at Bell Labs, which he published in 1971 under the title Synergy: Technical Integration and Technological Innovation in the Bell System.[38] Using terms easily accessible even to laymen, he analyzed and expanded on technical and  philosophical aspects of systems engineering as practised at Bell Labs.[38] He explained how seemingly different fields of Engineering were merging, guided by the necessity of the flow of information between system components that transcended previously well defined boundaries and thus he introduced us to a technological paradigm shift.[39] As it is clear from the title of the book as well as its contents, he became one of the early exponents of technological convergence, infometrics and information processing before the terms even existed./nIn 1974, he retired for the second time and Harvard awarded him the honorary position of professor emeritus. He, nevertheless, kept his office at Harvard and continued working from there, mainly as an advisor to government on policy matters.[10]/nBode received awards, honours and professional distinctions./nIn 1960 he received the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award.[40]/nIn 1969, IEEE awarded him the renowned Edison Medal for \"fundamental contributions to the arts of communication, computation and control; for leadership in bringing mathematical science to bear on engineering problems; and for guidance and creative counsel in systems engineering\",[1] a tribute that eloquently summarized the wide spectrum of his innovative contributions to engineering science and applied mathematics as a researcher, and to society as an advisor and professor./nIn 1975, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers awarded him the Rufus Oldenburger Medal citing: \"In recognition of his attainments in advancing the science and technology of automatic control and particularly for his development of frequency domain techniques that are widely used in the design of feedback control systems.\"[41][1][42]/nIn 1979, he became the first recipient of the Richard E.

These studies had the additional distinction of being the first ever to be prepared by the Academy for the Legislative Branch, or more specifically for the Committee on Science and Astronautics of the U.S. House of Representatives,[10] thus fulfilling the Academy's mandate, under its Charter, as an advisory body to the U.S. Government./nThe predecessor of NASA was NACA. NACA's Special Committee on Space Technology also called the Stever Committee, after its chairman Guyford Stever, was a special steering committee that was formed with the mandate to coordinate various branches of the Federal government, private companies as well as universities within the United States with NACA's objectives and also harness their expertise in order to develop a space program.[7]\nCommittee members included: Bode  and Wernher von Braun the father of the US space program.[6][7]/nIt is a historical irony that Hendrik Wade Bode, the man who helped develop the robot weapons that  brought down the Nazi V-1 flying bombs over London during World War II, was actually serving in the same committee and sitting at the same table as Wernher von Braun who worked on the development of the V-1 and was the head of the team which developed the V-2, the weapon that terrorised London.[29][30][31]/nBode was an avid reader in his spare time.[14] He also co-wrote with his wife Barbara a fictional story Counting House, which was published by Harper's Magazine in August 1936.[47] Bode also enjoyed boating. Early on in his career, while working for Bell Labs in New York, he sailed a boat on Long Island Sound.[14] After World War\u00a0II, he explored the upper reaches of the Chesapeake Bay near the eastern shore of Maryland with a surplus landing craft (LCT)[dubious  \u2013 discuss] he had bought.[14] He also enjoyed gardening and do-it-yourself projects.[14] He was married to Barbara Bode (nee Poore). Together they had two children: Dr.\u00a0Katharine Bode Darlington and Mrs.\u00a0Anne Hathaway Bode Aarnes.[10][14]/nBode, despite all the high distinctions he received, both from academia and government, did not rest on his laurels. He believed that engineering, as an institution, deserved a place in the Pantheon of academia as much as science did.

Budan died in Paris on 6 October 1840./nBudan explains in his book how, given a monic polynomial p(x), the coefficients of p(x+1) can be obtained by developing a Pascal-like triangle with first row the coefficients of p(x), rather than by expanding successive powers of x+1, as in Pascal's triangle proper, and then summing; thus, the method has the flavour of lattice path combinatorics. Taken together with Descartes' Rule of Signs, this leads to an upper bound on the number of the real roots a polynomial has inside an open interval. Although Budan's Theorem, as this result was known, was taken up by, among others, Pierre Louis Marie Bourdon (1779-1854), in his celebrated algebra textbook, it tended to be eclipsed by an equivalent result due to Joseph Fourier, as the consequence of a priority dispute. Interest in Budan's theorem has been revived because some further computational results are more easily deducible from it than from Fourier's version of the theorem./nBudan's book was read across the English Channel; for example, Peter Barlow includes mention of it in his entry on Approximation[permanent dead link] in his Dictionary (1814), although grouping it with the method of Joseph-Louis Lagrange as being accurate, but of more theoretical interest than practical use. Budan's work on approximation was studied by Horner in preparing his celebrated article in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1819 that gave rise to the term Horner's method; Horner comments there and elsewhere on Budan's results, at first being sceptical of the value of Budan's work, but later warming to it. Thus, these writers in English have a different appreciation of Budan's work to a French writer, such as Bourdon; indeed, Horner was praised over Budan for being able to go directly from p(x) to p(x+a) for any a, rather than taking this in steps after the manner of Budan. Barlow and Horner show some awareness of the work of another writer in French, Louis-Benjamin Francoeur (1773-1849), who also looked at how to obtain the coefficients of p(x+a) from those of p(x) along the lines of Budan and Horner about the same time as Horner first published his work. But Budan's name and theorem only appear in late editions of Francoeur's book./nBudan, in common with other writers in French of the period working on root extraction, does not mention Paolo Ruffini, notwithstanding Ruffini had been in correspondence with Lagrange; this was not just an English failing. Ruffini's work on the topic dates, in the first instance, from 1804, but, as with Budan and then Horner, several subsequent reworkings.", "6813298": "Yves Marie Andr\u00e9  (1675\u20131764), also known as le P\u00e8re Andr\u00e9,  was a French Jesuit mathematician, philosopher, and essayist./nAndr\u00e9 entered the Society of Jesus in 1693.

He is the author of 3 books and the author of co-author of over 100 research articles.[3]/nCohen developed in 1990, with Ingrid Daubechies and Jean-Christophe Feauveau, the first biorthogonal bases for wavelets;[4] this research has an important application in the image compression standard JPEG-2000. With Wolfgang Dahmen and Ronald DeVore, Cohen then worked on the analysis of nonlinear and adaptive approximation methods, with a view to applications in learning theory and in numerical analysis of partial differential equations. He is interested in algorithmic problems involving a very large number of variables, which cause a prohibitive increase in the complexity of calculations. These problems arise in statistical learning theory, in the treatment of parametric and stochastic partial differential equations, and in the development of response surfaces from computer software involving adaptive numerical methods.[2]/nIn 2000 Cohen received the grand prix Jacques Herbrand from the French Academy of Sciences.

He studied at the University of Edinburgh.  His doctoral thesis \"The disruptive discharge of electricity\"[1] reported on experimental results from the laboratory of Peter Guthrie Tait./nIn 1878 Macfarlane spoke at the Royal Society of Edinburgh on algebraic logic as introduced by George Boole. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Peter Guthrie Tait, Philip Kelland, Alexander Crum Brown, and John Hutton Balfour.[2] The next year he published Principles of the Algebra of Logic which interpreted Boolean variable expressions with algebraic manipulation.[3]/nDuring his life, Macfarlane played a prominent role in research and education. He taught at the universities of Edinburgh and St Andrews, was physics professor at the University of Texas (1885\u20131894),[4] professor of Advanced Electricity, and later of mathematical physics, at Lehigh University. In 1896 Macfarlane encouraged the association of quaternion students to promote the algebra.[5] He became the Secretary of the Quaternion Society, and in 1909 its president. He edited the Bibliography of Quaternions that the Society published in 1904./nMacfarlane was also the author of a popular 1916 collection of mathematical biographies (Ten British Mathematicians), a similar work on physicists (Lectures on Ten British Physicists of the Nineteenth Century, 1919). Macfarlane was caught up in the revolution in geometry during his lifetime,[6] in particular through the influence of G. B. Halsted who was mathematics professor at the University of Texas. Macfarlane originated an Algebra of Physics, which was his adaptation of quaternions to physical science. His first publication on Space Analysis preceded the presentation of Minkowski Space by seventeen years.[7]/nMacfarlane actively participated in several International Congresses of Mathematicians including the primordial meeting in Chicago, 1893, and the Paris meeting of 1900 where he spoke on \"Application of space analysis to curvilinear coordinates\"./nMacfarlane retired to Chatham, Ontario, where he died in 1913.[8]/nAlexander Macfarlane stylized his work as \"Space Analysis\". In 1894 he published his five earlier papers[9] and a book review of Alexander McAulay's Utility of Quaternions in Physics. Page numbers are carried from previous publications, and the reader is presumed familiar with quaternions. The first paper is \"Principles of the Algebra of Physics\" where he first proposes the hyperbolic quaternion algebra, since \"a student of physics finds a difficulty in principle of quaternions which makes the square of a vector negative.\" The second paper is \"The Imaginary of the Algebra\". Similar to Homersham Cox (1882/83),[10][11] Macfarlane uses the hyperbolic versor as the hyperbolic quaternion corresponding to the versor of Hamilton. The presentation is encumbered by the notation/nLater he conformed to the notation exp(A \u03b1) used by Euler and Sophus Lie. The expression \n\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03c0\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\alpha ^{\\pi /2}}\n\n is meant to emphasize that \u03b1 is a right versor, where \u03c0/2 is the measure of a right angle in radians. The \u03c0/2 in the exponent is, in fact, superfluous./nPaper three is \"Fundamental Theorems of Analysis Generalized for Space\". At the 1893 mathematical congress Macfarlane read his paper \"On the definition of the trigonometric functions\" where he proposed that the radian be defined as a ratio of areas rather than of lengths: \"the true analytical argument for the circular ratios is not the ratio of the arc to the radius, but the ratio of twice the area of a sector to the square on the radius.\"[12] The paper was withdrawn from the published proceedings of mathematical congress (acknowledged at page 167), and privately published in his Papers on Space Analysis (1894). Macfarlane reached this idea or ratios of areas while considering the basis for hyperbolic angle which is analogously defined.[13]/nThe fifth paper is \"Elliptic and Hyperbolic Analysis\" which considers the spherical law of cosines as the fundamental theorem of the sphere, and proceeds to analogues for the ellipsoid of revolution, general ellipsoid, and equilateral hyperboloids of one and two sheets, where he provides the hyperbolic law of cosines./nIn 1900 Alexander published \"Hyperbolic Quaternions\"[14] with the Royal Society in Edinburgh, and included a sheet of nine figures, two of which display conjugate hyperbolas.

Ross was born in the small town of Park Hill, Oklahoma, the second of five children of William Wallace Ross Jr and Mary Henrietta Moore Ross.[6] She was the great-granddaughter of the Cherokee Chief John Ross. John Ross was influential in the creation of the new settlement in Oklahoma following the removal of Native Americans from their land under Andrew Jackson. This settlement for the Cherokee Nation was complete with a school and government.[7]/nA talented child, she was sent to live with her grandparents in the Cherokee Nation capital of Tahlequah, Oklahoma to attend primary and secondary school.[8]/nWhen she was 16, Ross enrolled in Northeastern State Teachers' College in Tahlequah. She earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1928, at age 20.[9]/nIn 1938, Ross received her Master's degree in mathematics from Colorado State Teachers College, now known as the University of Northern Colorado, in Greeley.[10] While obtaining her Master's, Ross still took as many astronomy classes as were offered to satisfy her intense fascination with space.[4]/nIn 1949, after World War II, Lockheed sent Mary G. Ross to the University of California, Los Angeles to study further. While at UCLA, she was able to obtain a professional certification in engineering.[7] Ross was the first Native American woman to obtain this certification.[4][3]/nRoss began her career teaching math and science in rural Oklahoma schools for nine years, mostly during the Great Depression.[11]/nIn 1936, Ross took the civil service examination to work for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in Washington, D.C., as a statistical clerk.[6]/nIn 1937, she was reassigned as an advisor to girls at the Santa Fe Indian School, an American Indian boarding school in Santa Fe, New Mexico.[10][12] While she was working at the boarding school, Ross was working towards completing her Master's in mathematics.[4]/nA few years after obtaining her Master's degree, Ross relocated to California in 1941 to seek work after the US joined World War II.[10]/nIn 1942, Ross was hired as a mathematician by Lockheed. Her primary role, at the beginning of her career at Lockheed, was working on developing fighter planes.[3] One of her assignments during this time was analyzing the effects of pressure on the Lockheed P-38 Lightning. The P-38 was one of the fastest airplanes designed at the time: it was the first military airplane to fly faster than 400\u00a0mph (640\u00a0km/h) in level flight.[13][14] Throughout her career, Ross helped to solve numerous design issues involved with high speed flight and issues of aeroelasticity for fighter jets.[11] Ross was able to perform intricate calculations to advance the field of aerospace design using only a pencil, slide rule, and Friden computer.[7]/nFollowing WWII, when men returned from war and displaced women from the jobs they held during the war, Lockheed decided to keep Ross on their team. They even sent Ross to UCLA for a professional certification in engineering, which she obtained in 1949.[3]/nIn 1952, Ross helped found Lockheed's Advanced Development Program, known as Skunk Works. She was one of only forty people who worked on this project and was the only female on the team.[15] The work done by Ross and her team for the Skunk Works project was highly confidential, and even now, most of the specifics are still classified.[4] However, it is known that Ross's work on the Skunk Works project involved \"preliminary design concepts for interplanetary space travel, crewed and uncrewed earth-orbiting flights, the earliest studies of orbiting satellites for both defense and civilian purposes.\"[4]/nAs the nation\u2019s focus shifted towards the Cold War and new weapon technology in the form of missiles, Lockheed recognized this shift and created the Lockheed Missiles and Space branch.[16] Ross played an important role in research and performance evaluation of ballistic missiles and other new defense technologies for this new branch. It was also during this time that Ross made important discoveries for advancing technology related to submarine launched spacecrafts and defense systems that would apply to the Polaris project.[15]/nAnother major contribution Ross made while at Lockheed was for the Agena rocket project. The Agena rocket was a big part of the Gemini mission, which was a manned space exploration aimed towards testing equipment and various procedures while in Earth's orbit.[17] The Agena was used as a rendezvous and docking spot for the Gemini team. This project came to fruition in 1966 when it was launched into space and had a successful mission.[17] This project was the beginning of the United States' involvement in the space age.[3] Ross's main role in this project was in developing the specific criteria for the rocket itself using her extensive research in hydrodynamics. This aided in her advancement to establishing preliminary design concepts for flyby missions to Venus and Mars.[3]/nBy the late 1960s, Ross was promoted to the senior advanced systems staff engineer position. This led to Ross joining the team working on the Poseidon and Trident missiles.[18][19]/nRoss's engineering career at Lockheed prepared her for her contributions to the NASA Planetary Flight Handbook Vol. 3, which is still relevant to space travel today.[3][15]/nAfter retiring in 1973, Ross lived in Los Altos, California[20] and worked to recruit young women and Native American youth into engineering careers.

He corresponded with fellow mathematicians such as Pierre Gassendi,  Pierre H\u00e9rigone and Marin Mersenne. It is unclear when or where he died but he probably lived from 1610 to 1660.[1]/nNot much is known about Le Tenneur\u2019s personal life and most information comes from his letters to Mersenne and Garrendi. He was mostly self-educated during his early life in Paris. By 1646 he spent a little time in Clermont in the Auvergne region of central France. and then returned to settle in Paris. [1]/nIn 1651 he became King Louis XIV\u2019s counsellor to the provincial senate of the old French province of Guyenne in Bordeaux. A civil war in France called the Fronde was going on at this time and involved Guyenne so Le Tenneur was probably involved with the political feuding of the civil war.[1]/nLe Tenneur was one of the few French scholars to understand Galileo and was involved in the debates around the controversy of falling bodies.[2]/nUntil Galileo, it was thought that the speed of a falling body was proportional to its weight. The larger the weight, the faster its speed. Galileo probably did not drop balls of different weights off the leaning tower of Pisa but he did write De Motu Antiquiora about rolling balls of different weights and measuring their speeds.[3]/nIn 1646, Honor\u00e9 Fabri debated Galileo\u2019s theory of falling bodies. Mersenne, asked Le Tenneur to support Galileo against these attacks.  Basically, Fabri argued that Galileo was resorting to the existence of mathematical instants which had been an ancient problem in Zeno's paradoxes. Thomas Aquinas, wrote \u201cInstants are not parts of time, for time is not made up of instants any more than a magnitude is made of points. Hence it does not follow that a thing is not in motion in a given time, just because it is not in motion in any instant of that time.\u201d[1]/nLe Tenneur pushed back that Fabri\u2019s theory also required mathematical instants but that Galileo\u2019s theory was superior as it did not depend on time measurements.[4]/nFabri got an anonymous copy of this critique from Mersenne and was impressed with the logic. Le Tenneur incorporated this in his most important work. \"De motu naturaliter accelerato tractatus physico-mathematicus\u201d./n\u201cIt must needs be the case that the first space is to the second space like the two first spaces to the two subsequent ones, as has been shown against Fabri, because we obviously need a principle of uniformity in natural events as these need to proceed in an uninterrupted course. The consequence of this is that heavy bodies have no innate speed, but that in falling, they pass through all degrees of slowness and speed.\u201d[4]/nAnother debate during his life was whether a vacuum could be created. The commonly held view was that nature abhorred a vacuum horror vacui.  There was speculation that even God could not create a vacuum if he wanted. The church\u2019s 1277 Paris condemnations of Bishop Etienne Tempier, stated that there could be no restrictions on the powers of God, which led to the conclusion that God could create a vacuum if he so wished.[5]/nAround 1644, Evangelista Torricelli created a vacuum by inverting a column of mercury in a tube. There was still skepticism that a vacuum had actually been created so in January 1648, Mersenne asked if Le Tenneur could repeat the experiment of creating a vacuum at a higher elevation in Puy-de-D\u00f4me.[1]/nLe Tenneur refused saying that it would be a waste of time and that there would be no difference. (Of course there would be but for reasons of atmospheric pressure rather than vacuum). The Puy-de-D\u00f4me experiment was finally carried out in 1648 by others and led to the development of the barometer.[6]/nMersenne was wrong in thinking that since light could pass through the space above the mercury column than it was probably not a vacuum.  Le Tenneur was on the right side of this argument saying that if something of substance really did exist above the mercury column the mercury would have fallen further. [7]/nIn 1640, Le Tenneur published \u201cTrait\u00e9 des quantites incommensurables ou sont decidees plusieurs belles questions des nombres rationaus et irrationaus, l'erreurs de Stevin refut\u00e9es, le dizieme livre d'Euclide illustre de nouvelles demonstrations\u201d.

[2]/nIn 1986, Paris became an elected fellow of the British Institute of Mathematics and its Applications.[4]/nThe work of Paris deals with the asymptotic behaviour of a wide scope of special functions, in many case with a connection to physical problems./nIn collaboration with David Kaminski, associate professor of mathematics at the University of Lethbridge, Paris published the monograph Asymptotics and Mellin-Barnes integrals. It is one of the few textbooks that extensively treats the application of Mellin transforms particularly to different asymptotic problems. Mellin-Barnes integrals constitute a special class of contour integrals that feature special functions in the integrand, most frequently products of gamma functions. Their evaluation relies on the residue theorem and requires appropriate manipulations of the integration path. The name is due to the mathematicians R. H. Mellin and E. W. Barnes. Many integrals can be transformed to a Mellin-Barnes representation, by writing their integrands in terms of inverse Mellin transforms. In the context of Laplace-type integrals, this technique provides a powerful alternative to Laplace's method. In general, however, it admits a broader applicability and much space for modifications. This versatility is shown by means of several examples from number theory and integrals of higher dimension.[5]/nIn his monograph Hadamard Expansions and Hyperasymptotic Evaluation: An Extension of the Method of Steepest Descent, by means of theoretical and numerical examples, Paris illustrates the application of Laplace's method and possibilities to achieve a higher accuracy. The term Hadamard expansions describes a special kind of asymptotic expansions whose coefficients are again series. It refers to the French mathematician Jacques Hadamard who introduced the first series of this kind in 1908 in his paper Sur l'expression asymptotique de la fonction de Bessel.[6]/nParis also organized the chapters 8 and 11, respectively about the incomplete Gamma and about the Struve functions and related functions, of the NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions and of the NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions.

Mechanisms that could possibly be simulated by machines.[6]/nWiener was born in Columbia, Missouri, the first child of Leo Wiener and Bertha Kahn, Jewish immigrants from Lithuania and Germany, respectively. Through his father, he was related to Maimonides, the famous rabbi, philosopher and physician from Al Andalus, as well as to Akiva Eger, chief rabbi of Posen from 1815 to 1837.[7]:\u200ap. 4/nLeo had educated Norbert at home until 1903, employing teaching methods of his own invention, except for a brief interlude when Norbert was 7 years of age. Earning his living teaching German and Slavic languages, Leo read widely and accumulated a personal library from which the young Norbert benefited greatly. Leo also had ample ability in mathematics and tutored his son in the subject until he left home. In his autobiography, Norbert described his father as calm and patient, unless he (Norbert) failed to give a correct answer, at which his father would lose his temper./nIn \u201cThe Theory of Ignorance\u201d, a paper he wrote at the age of 10, he disputed \u201cman\u2019s presumption in declaring that his knowledge has no limits\u201d, arguing that all human knowledge \u201cis based on an approximation\u201d, and acknowledging \u201cthe impossibility of being certain of anything.\u201d[8]/nHe graduated from Ayer High School in 1906 at 11 years of age, and Wiener then entered Tufts College. He was awarded a BA in mathematics in 1909 at the age of 14, whereupon he began graduate studies of zoology at Harvard.  In 1910 he transferred to Cornell to study philosophy. He graduated in 1911 at 17 years of age.[citation needed]/nThe next year he returned to Harvard, while still continuing his philosophical studies. Back at Harvard, Wiener became influenced by Edward Vermilye Huntington, whose mathematical interests ranged from axiomatic foundations to engineering problems. Harvard awarded Wiener a PhD in June 1913, when he was only 19 years old, for a dissertation on mathematical logic (a comparison of the work of Ernst Schr\u00f6der with that of Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell), supervised by Karl Schmidt, the essential results of which were published as Wiener (1914). He was one of the youngest to achieve such a feat. In that dissertation, he was the first to state publicly that ordered pairs can be defined in terms of elementary set theory. Hence relations can be defined by set theory, thus the theory of relations does not require any axioms or primitive notions distinct from those of set theory. In 1921, Kazimierz Kuratowski proposed a simplification of Wiener's definition of ordered pairs, and that simplification has been in common use ever since. It is (x, y) = {{x}, {x, y}}./nIn 1914, Wiener traveled to Europe, to be taught by Bertrand Russell and G. H. Hardy at Cambridge University, and by David Hilbert and Edmund Landau at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. At G\u00f6ttingen he also attended three courses with Edmund Husserl \"one on Kant's ethical writings, one on the principles of Ethics, and the seminary on Phenomenology.\" (Letter to Russell, c. June or July, 1914). During 1915\u201316, he taught philosophy at Harvard, then was an engineer for General Electric and wrote for the Encyclopedia Americana. Wiener was briefly a journalist for the Boston Herald, where he wrote a feature story on the poor labor conditions for mill workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts, but he was fired soon afterwards for his reluctance to write favorable articles about a politician the newspaper's owners sought to promote.[9]/nAlthough Wiener eventually became a staunch pacifist, he eagerly contributed to the war effort in World War I. In 1916, with America's entry into the war drawing closer, Wiener attended a training camp for potential military officers but failed to earn a commission. One year later Wiener again tried to join the military, but the government again rejected him due to his poor eyesight. In the summer of 1918, Oswald Veblen invited Wiener to work on ballistics at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.[10] Living and working with other mathematicians strengthened his interest in mathematics. However, Wiener was still eager to serve in uniform and decided to make one more attempt to enlist, this time as a common soldier. Wiener wrote in a letter to his parents, \"I should consider myself a pretty cheap kind of a swine if I were willing to be an officer but unwilling to be a soldier.\"[11] This time the army accepted Wiener into its ranks and assigned him, by coincidence, to a unit stationed at Aberdeen, Maryland. World War I ended just days after Wiener's return to Aberdeen and Wiener was discharged from the military in February 1919.[12]/nWiener was unable to secure a permanent position at Harvard, a situation he attributed largely to anti-Semitism at the university and in particular the antipathy of Harvard mathematician G. D. Birkhoff.[13] He was also rejected for a position at the University of Melbourne. At W. F. Osgood's suggestion, Wiener was hired as an instructor of mathematics at MIT, where, after his promotion to professor, he spent the remainder of his career. For many years his photograph was prominently displayed in the Infinite Corridor and often used in giving directions, but as of 2017[update], it has been removed.[14]/nIn 1926, Wiener returned to Europe as a Guggenheim scholar. He spent most of his time at G\u00f6ttingen and with Hardy at Cambridge, working on Brownian motion, the Fourier integral, Dirichlet's problem, harmonic analysis, and the Tauberian theorems./nIn 1926, Wiener's parents arranged his marriage to a German immigrant, Margaret Engemann; they had two daughters. His sister, Constance (1898\u20131973), married mathematician Philip Franklin. Their daughter, Janet, Wiener's niece, married mathematician V\u00e1clav E. Bene\u0161.[15] Norbert Wiener's sister, Bertha (1902\u20131995), married the botanist Carroll William Dodge./nMany tales, perhaps apocryphal, were told of Norbert Wiener at MIT, especially concerning his absent-mindedness.  It was said that he returned home once to find his house empty. He inquired of a neighborhood girl the reason, and she said that the family had moved elsewhere that day.  He thanked her for the information and she replied, \"That's why I stayed behind, Daddy!\"[16]\nAsked about the story, Wiener's daughter reportedly asserted that \"he never forgot who his children were! The rest of it, however, was pretty close to what actually happened\u2026\"[17]/nIn the run-up to World War II (1939\u201345) Wiener became a member of the China Aid Society and the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced German Scholars.[18]\nHe was interested in placing scholars such as Yuk-Wing Lee and Antoni Zygmund who had lost their positions.[19]/nDuring World War II, his work on the automatic aiming and firing of anti-aircraft guns caused Wiener to investigate information theory independently of Claude Shannon and to invent the Wiener filter. (To him is due the now standard practice of modeling an information source as a random process\u2014in other words, as a variety of noise.) Initially his anti-aircraft work led him to write, with Arturo Rosenblueth and Julian Bigelow the 1943 article 'Behavior, Purpose and Teleology', which was published in Philosophy of Science. Subsequently his anti-aircraft work led him to formulate cybernetics.[20][21] After the war, his fame helped MIT to recruit a research team in cognitive science, composed of researchers in neuropsychology and the mathematics and biophysics of the nervous system, including Warren Sturgis McCulloch and Walter Pitts. These men later made pioneering contributions to computer science and artificial intelligence. Soon after the group was formed, Wiener suddenly ended all contact with its members, mystifying his colleagues. This emotionally traumatized Pitts, and led to his career decline. In their biography of Wiener, Conway and Siegelman suggest that Wiener's wife Margaret, who detested McCulloch's bohemian lifestyle, engineered the breach.[22]/nWiener later helped develop the theories of cybernetics, robotics, computer control, and automation. He discussed the modeling of neurons with John von Neumann, and in a letter from November 1946 von Neumann presented his thoughts in advance of a meeting with Wiener.[23]/nWiener always shared his theories and findings with other researchers, and credited the contributions of others. These included Soviet researchers and their findings. Wiener's acquaintance with them caused him to be regarded with suspicion during the Cold War. He was a strong advocate of automation to improve the standard of living, and to end economic underdevelopment. His ideas became influential in India, whose government he advised during the 1950s./nAfter the war, Wiener became increasingly concerned with what he believed was political interference with scientific research, and the militarization of science. His article \"A Scientist Rebels\" from the January 1947 issue of The Atlantic Monthly[24] urged scientists to consider the ethical implications of their work. After the war, he refused to accept any government funding or to work on military projects. The way Wiener's beliefs concerning nuclear weapons and the Cold War contrasted with those of von Neumann is the major theme of the book John Von Neumann and Norbert Wiener.[25]/nWiener was a participant of the Macy conferences./nIn 1926 Wiener married Margaret Engemann, an assistant professor of modern languages at Juniata College.[citation needed] They had two daughters. Opinions are not all positive on Margaret's impacts on Wiener's career.[26]/nWiener admitted in his autobiography I Am a Mathematician: The Later Life of a Prodigy to abusing benzadrine throughout his life without being fully aware of its dangers.[27]/nWiener died in March 1964, aged 69, in Stockholm, from a heart attack. Wiener and his wife are buried at the Vittum Hill Cemetery in Sandwich, New Hampshire./nInformation is information, not matter or energy./nWiener was an early studier of stochastic and mathematical noise processes, contributing work relevant to electronic engineering, electronic communication, and control systems. It was Wiener's idea to model a signal as if it were an exotic type of noise, giving it a sound mathematical basis. The example often given to students is that English text could be modeled as a random string of letters and spaces, where each letter of the alphabet (and the space) has an assigned probability. But Wiener dealt with analog signals, where such a simple example doesn't exist. Wiener's early work on information theory and signal processing was limited to analog signals, and was largely forgotten with the development of the digital theory.[31]/nWiener is one of the key originators of cybernetics, a formalization of the notion of feedback, with many implications for engineering, systems control, computer science, biology, philosophy, and the organization of society. His work with cybernetics influenced Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead, and through them, anthropology, sociology, and education.[32]/nA simple mathematical representation of Brownian motion, the Wiener equation, named after Wiener, assumes the current velocity of a fluid particle fluctuates randomly./nFor signal processing, the Wiener filter is a filter proposed by Wiener during the 1940s and published in 1942 as a classified document. Its purpose is to reduce the amount of noise present in a signal by comparison with an estimate of the desired noiseless signal. Wiener developed the filter at the Radiation Laboratory at MIT to predict the position of German bombers from radar reflections. It is necessary to predict the position, because by the time the shell reaches the vicinity of the target, the target will have moved, and may have changed direction slightly. They even modeled the muscle response of the pilot, which led eventually to cybernetics. The unmanned V1's were particularly easy to model, and on a good day, American guns fitted with Wiener filters would shoot down 99 out of 100 V1's as they entered Britain from the English channel,[citation needed] on their way to London. What emerged was a mathematical theory of great generality\u2014a theory for predicting the future as best one can on the basis of incomplete information about the past. It was a statistical theory that included applications that did not, strictly speaking, predict the future, but only tried to remove noise. It made use of Wiener's earlier work on integral equations and Fourier transforms.[33]\n[34]/nWiener studied polynomial chaos, a key piece of which is the Hermite-Laguerre expansion. This was developed in detail in Nonlinear Problems in Random Theory./nWiener applied Hermite-Laguerre expansion to nonlinear system identification and control. Specifically, a nonlinear system can be identified by inputting a white noise process and computing the Hermite-Laguerre expansion of its output.

Consequently, the one-dimensional version of Brownian motion was named the Wiener process.

In 1869, he was awarded a Doctor of Medicine and Surgery degree, and two years later, in 1871, he earned a doctorate of Law and Political Science, for which he wrote a thesis on the \"Constitution of 1863\". The thesis declared that the Colombian people could no longer be governed by liberalism, including the Constitution and its laws./nAfter returning from battle in 1865, Alb\u00e1n set about reorganizing the Conservative Party which had virtually disappeared. To achieve this, he founded Los Principios, a newspaper in Cali, in 1870. The newspaper called for political activism and denounced the state of social disorder, which had resulted from the Rionegro and Cauca Constitutions. He believed that there existed a \"carte blanche for violence,\" that the regime of individual liberty had degenerated in favor of the liberal mindset, and that many conservatives \"had abandoned the main focus.\" In 1871, the paper had to be closed due to distribution problems./nLater that year, Alb\u00e1n founded the Principios Pol\u00edtico-Religiosos (the Politico-Religious Principles) newspaper in Popayan, with assistance from Fernando Angulo and Sergio Arboleda, with whom he reorganized the Conservative Party.

Persons who \"support Catholicism with all its consequences, and without restrictions of any kind, regardless of what may happen and also the political party to which they belong\" were invited to join./nHis journalism expressed the importance of Catholicism as an element of political cohesion. He had noted that the clergy, especially Carlos Bermudez, Bishop of Popayan and Manuel Canuto Restrepo, Bishop of Pasto, were important agitators. A huge image of the Virgin of Lourdes in Cauca was used in processions for political purposes. They formed various Catholic Societies, such as the society of St. Vincent de Paul, Sacred Heart and others./nDespite advances in building the party, the political conditions in Cauca led to the project being abandoned. Alb\u00e1n led the conservatives into the 1876 war. Although the war bore characteristics of a religious war, they were not enough to ensure Conservative victory. The failure of the military adventure led to the expulsion of the clergy and the main conservatives, but more importantly, Alb\u00e1n's work enabled conservatism to survive as a party, despite liberal reprisals.

Mr. Carlos Alban, Colombia, is the sorcerer who attempts to produce these wonders, who is currently in Washington conferring with scientists and officials on how best to proceed. Dr. Alban has been attorney general of Colombia and is known as a remarkable scientific man. His plan embraces the principle of telescope reflective glass with several radical changes in old methods. Use a new procedure, first to the crystals themselves and adjusting the focus. So instead of moving the part of the eye, as currently practiced, move the lens itself for convenient adjustment. Dr. Alban has built an instrument of twenty-five inches in diameter, which has been shown in New York City and has shown great power. An apparatus for four yards in diameter, weighs only 200 pounds, and unless the eminent inventor has committed serious miscalculation, have such great power that will attract the moon at a distance of a mile from the land and will definitively resolve the question of structure and the possibility of life in that luminary.

He was the first to propose the idea of a loxodrome, and was the inventor of several measuring devices, including the nonius (from which Vernier scale was derived), named after his Latin surname.[6]/nLittle is known about Nunes' early education, life or family background, only that he was born in Alc\u00e1cer do Sal, his origins are possibly Jewish and that his grandchildren spent a few years behind bars after they were accused by the Portuguese Inquisition of professing and secretly practicing Judaism.[3][7] He studied at the University of Salamanca, maybe from 1521 until 1522, and at the University of Lisbon (this university later become the University of Coimbra) where he obtained a degree in medicine in 1525. In the 16th century medicine used astrology, so he also learned astronomy and mathematics.[6]/nHe continued his medical studies but held various teaching posts within the University of Lisbon, including Moral, Philosophy, Logic and Metaphysics. When, in 1537, the Portuguese University located in Lisbon returned to Coimbra, he moved to the re-founded University of Coimbra to teach mathematics, a post he held until 1562.[8] This was a new post in the University of Coimbra and it may have been established to provide instruction in the technical requirements for navigation: clearly a topic of great importance in Portugal at this period, when the control of sea trade was the primary source of Portuguese wealth. Mathematics became an independent post in 1544.[6]/nIn addition to teaching he was appointed Royal Cosmographer in 1529 and Chief Royal Cosmographer in 1547: a post which he held until his death.[6]/nIn 1531, King John III of Portugal charged Nunes with the education of his younger brothers Lu\u00eds and Henry. Years later Nunes was also charged with the education of the king's grandson, and future king, Sebastian.[6]/nIt is possible that, while at the University of Coimbra, future astronomer Christopher Clavius attended Pedro Nunes' classes, and was influenced by his works.[6] Clavius, proponent of the Gregorian Calendar, the greatest figure of the Col\u00e9gio Romano, the great center of Roman Catholic knowledge of that period, classified Nunes as \u201csupreme mathematical genius\".[7]  Nunes died in Coimbra./nPedro Nunes lived in a transition period, during which science was changing from valuing theoretical knowledge (which defined the main role of a  scientist/mathematician as commenting on previous authors), to providing experimental data, both as a source of information and as a method of confirming theories. Nunes was, above all, one of the last great commentators,[9] as is shown by his first published work \u201cTratado da Esfera\u201d, enriched with comments and additions that denote a profound knowledge of the difficult cosmography of the period.[7] He also acknowledged the value of experimentation./nIn his Tratado da sphera he argued for a common and universal diffusion of knowledge.[10] Accordingly, he not only published works in Latin, at that time science's lingua franca, aiming for an audience of European scholars, but also in Portuguese, and Spanish (Livro de Algebra)./nMuch of Nunes' work related to navigation. He was the first to understand why a ship maintaining a steady course would not travel along a great circle, the shortest path between two points on Earth, but would instead follow a spiral course, called a loxodrome.[7]  The later invention of logarithms allowed Leibniz to establish algebraic equations for the loxodrome.[11][12] These lines \u2014also called rhumb lines\u2014 maintain a fixed angle with the meridians. In other words, loxodromic curves are directly related to the construction of the Nunes connection \u2014also called navigator connection.[13]/nIn his Treaty defending the sea chart, Nunes argued that a nautical chart should have its parallels and meridians shown as straight lines. Yet he was unsure how to solve the problems that this caused: a situation that lasted until Mercator developed the projection bearing his name. The Mercator Projection is the system which is still used./nNunes also solved the problem of finding the day with the shortest twilight duration, for any given position, and its duration.[7] This problem per se is not greatly important, yet it shows the geometric genius of Nunes as it was a problem which was independently tackled by Johann and Jakob Bernoulli more than a century later with less success.[14] They could find a solution to the problem of the shortest day, but failed to determine its duration, possibly because they got lost in the details of differential calculus which, at that time, had only recently been developed. The achievement also shows that Nunes was a pioneer in solving maxima and minima problems, which became a common requirement only in the next century using differential calculus.[15]/nHe was probably the last major mathematician to make relevant improvements[according to whom?] to the ptolemaic system (a geocentric model describing the relative motion of the Earth and Sun). With time, in a slow and complex process, the geocentric model was replaced by the heliocentric system proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus. Nunes knew Copernicus' work but referred only briefly to it in his published works, with the purpose of correcting some mathematical errors./nMost of Nunes' achievements were possible because of his profound understanding of spherical trigonometry and his ability to transpose Ptolemy's adaptations of Euclidean geometry to it./nNunes worked on several practical nautical problems concerning course correction as well as attempting to develop more accurate devices to determine a ship's position.[15]/nHe created the nonius to improve instrument (such as the quadrant (instrument)) accuracy.  This consisted of a number of concentric circles traced on the instrument and dividing each successive one with one fewer divisions than the adjacent outer circle.  Thus the outermost quadrant would comprise 90\u00b0 in 90 equal divisions, the next inner would have 89 divisions, the next 88 and so on.  When an angle was measured, the circle and the division on which the alidade fell was noted.  A table was then consulted to provide the exact measure.[citation needed]/nThe nonius was used by Tycho Brahe, who considered it too complex. The method inspired improved systems by Christopher Clavius and Jacob Curtius.[17]  These were eventually improved further by Pierre Vernier in 1631, which reduced the nonius to the Vernier scale that includes two scales, one of them fixed and the other movable. Vernier himself used to say that his invention was a perfected nonius and for a long time it was known as the \u201cnonius\u201d, even in France.[7] In some languages, the Vernier scale is still named after Nunes, for example nonieskala in Swedish./nPedro Nunes also worked on some mechanics problems, from a mathematical point of view./nNunes was very influential internationally, e.g. on the work of John Dee[18] and Edward Wright.[19]/nPedro Nunes translated, commented and expanded some of the major works in his field, and he also published original research./nCommented and expanded translations:/nOriginal work:/nSome modern reprints:", "29390562": "Ian Ford [ FRSE FRCP(Glas) FSCT ][1] is a professor of biostatistics and a director of the Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, and a former Dean of Faculty of Information and Mathematical Sciences, at the University of Glasgow./nFord was born in Glasgow and educated at the former Hamilton Academy.

H. Hardy, which offers a defence of the pursuit of mathematics. Central to Hardy's \"apology\" \u2013 in the sense of a formal justification or defence (as in Plato's Apology of Socrates) \u2013 is an argument that mathematics has value independent of possible applications. Hardy located this value in the beauty of mathematics, and gave some examples of and criteria for mathematical beauty. The book also includes a brief autobiography, and gives the layman an insight into the mind of a working mathematician./nHardy felt the need to justify his life's work in mathematics at this time mainly for two reasons. Firstly, at age 62, Hardy felt the approach of old age (he had survived a heart attack in 1939) and the decline of his mathematical creativity and skills.\nBy devoting time to writing the Apology, Hardy was admitting that his own time as a creative mathematician was finished. In his foreword to the 1967 edition of the book, C. P. Snow describes the Apology as\n\"a passionate lament for creative powers that used to be and that will never come again\".[1]:\u200a51\u200a\nIn Hardy's words, \"Exposition, criticism, appreciation, is work for second-rate minds. [...] It is a melancholy experience for a professional mathematician to find himself writing about mathematics. The function of a mathematician is to do something, to prove new theorems, to add to mathematics, and not to talk about what he or other mathematicians have done.\"[2]:\u200a\u00a71/nSecondly, at the start of World War II, Hardy, a committed pacifist, wanted to justify his belief that mathematics should be pursued for its own sake rather than for the sake of its applications. He began writing on this subject when he was invited to contribute an article to Eureka,[2]:\u200aPreface\u200a the journal of The Archimedeans (the Cambridge University student mathematical society). One of the topics the editor suggested was \"something about mathematics and the war\", and the result was the article \"Mathematics in war-time\".[3] Hardy later incorporated this article into A Mathematician's Apology.[2]:\u200aPreface/nHe wanted to write a book in which he would explain his mathematical philosophy to the next generation of mathematicians; that would defend mathematics by elaborating on the merits of pure mathematics solely, without having to resort to the attainments of applied mathematics in order to justify the overall importance of mathematics; and that would inspire the upcoming generations of pure mathematicians. Hardy was an atheist, and makes his justification not to God but to his fellow men./nHardy initially submitted A Mathematician's Apology to Cambridge University Press with the intention of personally paying for its printing, but the Press decided to fund publication with an initial run of four thousand copies.[4]:\u200a97/nOne of the main themes of the book is the beauty that mathematics possesses, which Hardy compares to painting and poetry.[5] For Hardy, the most beautiful mathematics was that which had no practical applications in the outside world (pure mathematics) and, in particular, his own special field of number theory. Hardy contends that if useful knowledge is defined as knowledge which is likely to contribute to the material comfort of mankind in the near future (if not right now), so that mere intellectual satisfaction is irrelevant, then the great bulk of higher mathematics is useless. He justifies the pursuit of pure mathematics with the argument that its very \"uselessness\" on the whole meant that it could not be misused to cause harm. On the other hand, Hardy denigrates much of the applied mathematics as either being \"trivial\", \"ugly\", or  \"dull\", and contrasts it with \"real mathematics\", which is how he ranks the higher, pure mathematics./nHardy expounds by commenting about a phrase attributed to Carl Friedrich Gauss that \"Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and number theory is the queen of mathematics.\" Some people believe that it is the extreme non-applicability of number theory that led Gauss to the above statement about number theory; however, Hardy points out that this is certainly not the reason. If an application of number theory were to be found, then certainly no one would try to dethrone the \"queen of mathematics\" because of that. What Gauss meant, according to Hardy, is that the underlying concepts that constitute number theory are deeper and more elegant compared to those of any other branch of mathematics./nAnother theme is that mathematics is a \"young man's game\", so anyone with a talent for mathematics should develop and use that talent while they are young, before their ability to create original mathematics starts to decline in middle age. This view reflects Hardy's increasing depression at the wane of his own mathematical powers. For Hardy, real mathematics was essentially a creative activity, rather than an explanatory or expository one./nHardy's opinions were heavily influenced by the academic culture of the universities of Cambridge and Oxford between World War I and World War II./nSome of Hardy's examples seem unfortunate in retrospect.

In 2008, Plank co-authored a review paper that explored the mathematics behind the random walks model used to understand the biological  processes of the movement of animals, micro-organisms and cells. The paper noted that some of these basic models had limitations due to confusion in the literature between patterns that were observed and the underlying processes that may have generated them. The paper concluded random walk models allowed the systematic identification of these underlying mechanisms.[7] A further study in the same year presented a composite search model for non-destructive foraging behaviour based on Brownian motion compared to the L\u00e9vy walk. While it was shown that distinguishing between the two models might be difficult based on data in practice, the paper concluded that a \"mathematical expression\" had shown  the \"composite search model provides higher foraging efficiency than the L\u00e9vy model\".[8] The conclusion from the paper was that the composite search model provided higher foraging efficiency than the L\u00e9vy model, a finding also confirmed in a 2011 paper co-authored by Plank.[9] By 2015, a research project in which Plank participated, presented a method that could differentiate between the two models using a simulation study and possible likelihood functions including for a possible hidden Markov chain. In the Summary, the study concluded [that] \"by providing the means to differentiate between the two most prominent search models in the literature, and a framework that could be extended to include other models, we facilitate further research into the strategies animals use to find resource\".[10]/nPlank was part of a team that challenged the view nestedness increased the accuracy of a model to predict the survival of a specific species, and proposed that a \"simpler metric\u2014the number of mutualistic partners a species has\u2014is a much better predictor of individual species survival and hence, community persistence\".[11] The research team  examined previous data and applied \"computational and statistical methods to 59 empirical datasets representing mutualistic plant-pollinator networks..[which they said could]...disprove the accepted theory of nestedness\".[12]  Plank stated:/nReal-life networks, whether they are from ecology, economics, or Facebook, can be large and complex. This makes it difficult to tease apart causal relationships from confounding factors. This is where mathematical models come into their own. They allow us to systematically change one network attribute, such as nestedness, whilst controlling for other variables.[12]/nTwo biological scientists disputed this conclusion publishing data that showed a  positive relationship between nestedness and persistence, and James et al. cited data in a response that concluded \"[while]...nestedness is an interesting abstract network property that undoubtedly influences the statistical behaviour of large systems of differential equations...general conclusions allowing nestedness to be used as a predictor of empirical biodiversity cannot currently be justified\".[13]/nIn 2013, Plank suggested there needed to be a change in the way fish were caught commercially. He proposed a mathematically- based model to introduce \"balanced harvesting...[with]...less emphasis on catching big fish...[and more on]...catching a balanced cross-section\".[14] This supported the findings in an earlier research paper, co-authored by Plank, which explained that while the reasoning to protect small fish was to reduce the risk of damaging the life cycle, because the small fish had higher productivity, they might be more resilient than large fish in sustaining possible exploitation and it could be better to \"distribute fishing more widely across species and body sizes, balancing it more closely to the natural productivity of different organisms\".[15]/nThe research, based on population dynamics underpinning  the mathematical modelling, laid the groundwork for constructive discussion on fisheries management and how practices could potentially change in future. In a paper, he published jointly in the journal Fish and Fisheries in June 2018 Plank noted:/nYou are tracking biomass around an ecosystem in which there are predators and prey, big fish and small fish. You can then study the consequences of both predation and fishing and track the loss of biomass out of the ecosystem using different variables,...[and by comparing]...balanced harvesting with current fishing strategies [find] that balanced harvesting can mitigate that impact by reducing the number of large fish being caught.[16]/nWhile the idea did receive support, there was also some criticism and Plank co-authored a paper that examined the theory, evidence and legality of  balanced harvest and the degree that it could limit potential jeopardizing of marine resources. It noted that the debate was ongoing but concluded balanced harvest met legal frameworks, including those for conservation, was likely to support trophic of populations and increase the yield, and if successful would lead to a \"moderate reduction of biomass of all ecological groups\".[17] A further paper noted also that maximising yields and economic profits, and minimising environmental impact and biodiversity loss [was] \"more of a sociopolitical question than a scientific one, and [would] clearly involve compromises\".[18]/nPlank has collaborated to research strategies used to revitalise endangered languages and based on data from Wales, developed a model regarding language transmission by \"dividing the population into defined proficiency categories and dynamically quantifying transition rates between categories...[to]...predict changes in proficiency levels over time and, ultimately, whether a given endangered language is on a long-term trajectory towards extinction or recovery\".[19] Te reo M\u0101ori, the indigenous language of New Zealand, was a case study and using census data, the findings suggested that te reo M\u0101ori was on a \"pathway towards extinction\", but there were strategies that could restore the language \"to an upward trajectory\", with the research paper concluding:/nPossible government measures [included] the provision of language-medium early childhood education; integration of the language into the primary and secondary school curriculum; development of the quantity and quality of teachers; investment in language-immersion education as a crucial avenue for the development of proficiency.[19]/nPlank was an Associate Investigator for the NZ Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (NZIMA)-funded Canterbury Research programme on Modelling Invasive Species and Weed Impact, which recognised that \"invasive, non-native plants are a major component of global environmental change...[and aimed to]... \"determine the optimal use of resources between the competing demands of controlling existing weeds and stopping new weeds, thus minimising the negative impacts on indigenous biodiversity and ecosystem processes\".[20]  The project began with a workshop in 2007 that was attended by 51 international mathematicians, statisticians and ecologists.[21]/nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Plank applied his expertise to modelling the disease in New Zealand, and was a frequent media commentator.[2] As a mathematical modelling expert in infectious diseases, Plank worked with Te P\u016bnaha Matatini, a research centre hosted at the University of Auckland, leading to work with Covid-19 Modelling Aotearoa, to aid the New Zealand response to COVID-19. This involved application of mathematical models to explore a series of scenarios specific to New Zealand's situation during the pandemic and to directly inform the New Zealand Government policymakers.[22] On 25 March 2020 a state of emergency was declared in New Zealand after rising numbers of COVID cases and the country went into full lockdown.[23]\nAt that time, Plank, as one of the team at Te P\u016bnaha Matatini, co-authored a document based on simulations that had been used for a possible spread of COVID-19 in New Zealand and the model results allowed for a cautious conclusion that strategies to suppress the spread of the virus had two key benefits: \"(1) it may be possible to delay the epidemic for long enough that a vaccine and/or effective treatment become widely available in NZ; and (2) it allows NZ to learn from rapidly unfolding events in other countries. This could include learning which mitigation strategies are most successful, and how to ensure timing of control interventions is robust to uncertainty\".[24]/nIn April 2020, Plank was part of the team that published a document explaining the stochastic model they had used to investigate containment and elimination scenarios for COVID-19 for the country. It  was suggested that with low numbers, \"population-wide control methods combined with efficient tracing, testing, and case isolation, offer the opportunity for New Zealand to contain and eliminate COVID-19\".[25] A later review of the modelling for the first lockdown in New Zealand provided the background of the mathematical model used to inform the government's response and guiding policy. It showed that the models provided advice on how effectively the contract tracing system was working, the managing of risk from international arrivals in quarantine facilities and the predicted number of infected cases and likelihood of spread to the regions at the time of the second outbreak in August 2020. The paper concluded that well-funded systems to build mathematical modelling experience and the related structures to support the operation of the these, will increase the capacity of New Zealand to manage infectious diseases and preparedness for possible future pandemics.[26]/nIn September 2020, Plank co-authored an article on a study that had aimed to estimate inequities in COVID infection fatality rates (IFR) in New Zealand by ethnicity. After making adjustments for different age groups, unmet healthcare needs and comorbidities, the study concluded that infection mortality rates for M\u0101ori were estimated to be 50% higher than that of non-M\u0101ori and \"there [were] likely to be significant inequities in the health burden from COVID-19 in New Zealand by ethnicity...exacerbated by racism within the healthcare system and other inequities not reflected in official data... and should be included in future disease incidence and impact modelling\".[27]/nIn May 2021, the research team used a branching process model to factor in age and level of access to healthcare into scenarios to provide information concerning contact and infection rates across different demographic groups to inform possible policy interventions. The risk of increased transmission rates amongst children returning to school was predicted as low, but evidence showed a high risk of undetected outbreaks occurring in communities with low access to healthcare and a high degree of social isolation.  The paper concluded that the greater the inequity and social segregation, the longer it would take to detect outbreaks, and \"well-established evidence for health inequities, particularly in accessing primary healthcare and testing, indicat[ed] that M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples [were] at a higher risk of undetected outbreaks in Aotearoa New Zealand\".[28]/nThe team later published an article that showed the development of a model to investigate the importance of contract tracing in reducing the effective reproduction number in those in quarantine and isolation. The researchers concluded \"results show[ed] that a high-quality, rapid contact tracing system, combined with strong support for people in quarantine or isolation, [could] be highly effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19...[and]...improving the speed and capacity of contact tracing systems [was] likely to be more cost-effective than prolonged population-wide social distancing measures, although some level of social distancing may be also be needed to contain a resurgence\".[29]/nBy June 2021, modelling from Te P\u016bnaha Matatini calculated that it was likely vaccination rates of around 97% for New Zealanders would be necessary to reach herd immunity against the most infectious [variants of the virus. Plank explained that the more transmissible a variant of the virus was, the greater coverage of vaccine was needed, and once there were high levels of vaccination, the New Zealand borders could gradually be opened up. He also predicted that when about 75 per cent of the population was vaccinated, there would be a reductions in  hospitalisations and deaths but warned this may not be case in  some regions with low vaccination rates.[30]/nIn June 2021, when it was confirmed that a person infected with the Delta variant had visited Wellington, Plank was one of several experts including Dr Jemma Geoghegan who was asked to comment on the variant. Plank said data from around the world showed that the virus could spread after just brief contact and it had the potential to grow exponentially and be difficult to contain with a lockdown.  It also carried a heightened risk of hospitalisation, but data from the UK had shown that the Pfizer vaccine was highly effective against the variant and the measures in place in New Zealand to control COVID-19 in general would still work with Delta while vaccination rates are improved.[31]/nWhen New Zealand went into full lockdown following a case of the Delta variant in August 2021, Plank said this was the correct move because it allowed time to see results of testing and contact tracing and there was no clear link to the border. He noted that vaccination would  slow the outbreak, but coverage was not high enough to have a significant effect.[32]/nIn October 2021, as the New Zealand Government outlined the plan to ease restrictions in Auckland, Plank noted that this was a very uncertain part of the pandemic and the proposed changes indicated a move from the \"relative certainty of the elimination phase into the stage where we are seeing increasing cases in the community, and we are relying on a combination of restrictions and the vaccine to keep a lid on case numbers as we get more people vaccinated\". He expressed concerns that if the virus got out of Auckland, it could have devastating effects on vulnerable communities that had low rates of vaccination, and concluded that \"any further loosening of restrictions until we have got a picture of what the consequence of the most recent easing was could potentially cause things to spiral very rapidly\".[33]/nThe New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that Auckland would end its lockdown on 3 December 2021 as the country moved into the COVID-19 Protection Framework (also known as the Traffic Light warning system),[34][35][36] and Plank recommended that people going out of Auckland for holidays should consider \"not visiting regions or communities with low vaccination rates...[and warned]...once schools and workplaces go back in the new year, the virus will be able to spread more easily and there is a danger that case numbers could take off with multiple outbreaks across the country\".[37] After initially expressing concerns that the easing of restrictions was risky,[38][39] Plank said that the move to Red on the traffic light framework, was reasonable because of the good vaccination rates in the city and evidence that case numbers had levelled and hospitalisations were manageable. He cautioned, however, it was important to address gaps in vaccine coverage as \"the virus will find and exploit these gaps so we must redouble our efforts to fill them\".[40] Plank had earlier stated that New Zealand had been able to re-define elimination in practice as zero tolerance for transmission of the virus in the community and this move to a suppression approach was likely to result in greater freedoms for New Zealand citizens and a more managed border control because of good vaccination rates [which were] \"cutting the R number to around half what it would be with no vaccine...[and because the country had]...access to the vaccine before being exposed to the virus is a luxury people in most countries didn't have\".[41]/nOn 13 December 2021, with the possibility of the Omicron variant reaching New Zealand, Plank told Radio New Zealand that despite there needing to be more data to assess the severity of the variant, its high transmissibility and potential to more readily infect people already vaccinated, was a concern. He suggested there was a case to review plans to re-open the borders early in 2022, and that there would be a greater level of protections with  higher numbers of people getting a booster dose of the vaccine.[42] As cases of Omicron increased in Sydney, Plank later said that a case in the New Zealand community would require a really \"intensive contact tracing operation around it, and there may be a case for additional restrictions on top of that...[because]...the ability of Omicron to infect people who have had both doses of the vaccine is significantly higher than for Delta\".[43]/nOn 4 July 2022,  Plank described the rapid spread of BA.5 variant cases throughout New Zealand in July as a second wave of COVID-19 infections. He estimated that the BA.5 variant would overtake the BA.2 variant as the dominant variant in a matter of weeks.[44]/nWhile New Zealand was in a consolidation phase following the management of further lockdowns in Auckland in August 2020 and February 2021, Plank considered the implications of the 2020 Government's budget to manage future pandemics. While acknowledging that the response to COVID-19 had resulted in economic benefits as a result of some businesses being able to operate, it had exposed that the health system was underfunded, frontline healthcare workers needed better pay and there were entrenched inequities in the system that had contributed to M\u0101ori experiencing disproportionate outcomes from COVID-19. Other challenges identified as needing considerable Government funding included resourcing a strong vaccine roll out underpinned by a campaign to combat increased organised misinformation, and more funding for research and upgraded systems to gather and share data. Plank concluded that what was needed was: \"A long-term plan to invest in people and infrastructure will hopefully mean we are better placed to respond to the next pandemic.\"[45]/nIn response to a suggestion that the tourism sector had been 'abandoned' during the pandemic in New Zealand, Plank acknowledged that not allowing fully vaccinated overseas visitors into the country before May 2022 had been a source of frustration for tourism.  But he concluded that measures at the border should remain in the short term and that the cautious approach to easing border restrictions showed a managed transition away from the previous strategy of elimination, stressing the importance of a good vaccine uptake and careful attention to identifying possible new variants.[46]/nWhen the New Zealand Government acknowledged in January 2022 that the Omicron COVID-19 variant was likely to be circulating within the country, Plank said that while the modelling suggested possible widespread infection, public health measures and high rates of vaccination may lower these figures.[47] He later said that maintaining health services and supply chains would require careful management of the isolation periods for those infected with Omicron and warned of the risk of people returning to work while still infectious.[48]/nBy April 2022, as New Zealand eased some of the COVID-19 restrictions and allowed people to gather in unlimited numbers, Plank said it appeared that the country had \"flattened the curve of this Omicron wave\", and the efforts in preventing the spread so far had meant less strain on the healthcare system.[49]/nOn 14 August 2023, Ayesha Verrall announced that the New Zealand Government was removing all remaining COVID-19 public health requirements.[50] In the light of this, Plank co-authored an article on 24 August 2023 that acknowledged while the disease had become endemic, mathematical modelling showed that there was still a risk of new variants that could prove difficult to manage. The article explained how a mathematical model could show disease transmission, but this process was complicated in reality because populations were not homogenous and infections vary in different groups in society. The article noted interventions targetting vulnerable groups and widespread uptake of vaccines remained effective measures for preventing severe disease, but there was no guarantee [that] \"a reduction in the number of infectious contacts [would] translate to an equivalent reduction in infection rates\", concluding that having a focus on decreasing the number of infections, needed to be cost effective because of a \"range of healthcare needs competing for limited resources\".[51]/nPlank is a member of the NZ Prime Minister's Chief Science Advisor expert panel Towards a vision for fisheries in New Zealand in 2040.[52]/nPlank has been an active member of Australia and New Zealand Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ANZIAM) since 2010 when he was an Associate Editor for the ANZIAM Journal, and has represented ANZIAM on the Board of the International Council of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM) since 2016.

London (1923\u20132011) were American scholars who were known for their research on the social systems of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China (PRC) on the basis of refugee interviews. Both were born in the United States to immigrant parents from the Ukraine, which was then part of Russia and later the Soviet Union, and were exposed to a multi-lingual environment.[1] Both started their academic studies within the natural sciences. This early training in scientific disciplines appears to have had a major impact on the methodological treatises Ivan D. London contributed to the field of Social Science and on the methods he and his wife Miriam London applied in their interviewing approach and subsequent processing of amassed information. During the better part of the Cold War era their publications, particularly, in the field of Contemporary China Studies were considered highly controversial by the prevalent sinological academic circles. Today, it can hardly be denied that their research was ground breaking./nIvan D. London was born Jan. 8, 1913 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (US), where he studied mathematics at Temple University and earned his A. B. degree in 1935. After military service,[1] however, London turned to psychology. In 1945 he earned his A. M. degree in that discipline at Northwestern University in Illinois (US) and in 1950[2] he earned his doctoral degree at Tulane University in New Orleans (US). His Ph.D. thesis dealt with \"The convergent and divergent in Systematic Psychology\".[3] Early publications indicate that Ivan D. London's academic interest entirely focussed upon the state of affairs of psychology in the Soviet Union, particularly the conditions and procedures utilized within Soviet psychiatric hospitals:/nIn 1950 he joined the Russian Research Center at Harvard University where he worked as a research associate within the \"Harvard Refugee Interview Project on the Social System of the Soviet Union\" (Harvard Emigre Interview Project).[8][9]/nIn early 1952, however, Ivan D. London accepted the position of an associate professor at Brooklyn College at the City University of New York, where he was to teach social psychology, later as a full professor, until his death on April 12, 1983, in New York City.[10] In 1960 Ivan D. London also obtained the certificate of psychologist in the State of New York.[11]/nAt Brooklyn College Ivan D. and Miriam London established a research group which later became the \"Research Institute for Political Psychology\".[9][12] Via this institute, scholars from other universities were invited to collaborate on projects they were conducting, specifically Oleg Anisimov, Herbert H. Paper (1925-2012),[13] Gordon E. Peterson, Nikolai P. Poltoratzky (1921-1990), Ivan Elagin (1918-1987), Vladimir Samarin (1913-1992),[14] Avery D. Weisman (1913-2017) and others. In 1953 Ivan D. London was entrusted with the Inwood Project on Intercultural Communication, the scope and methods of which are reflected by the following six publications:/nIn the course of the three and a half years duration of that project a sample of 425 Soviet emigres was \"constituted in West Germany, Chile and America with a scattering in other countries\" and interviewed \"to replace the impressionistic reports of foreigners ... and propagandistic output of Soviet authorities by systematic research\".[21] The emigres consisted of (1) refugees who voluntarily left the Soviet Union during the last war, (2) former forced laborers, so-called Ostarbeiter, and prisoners-of-war, (3) defectors who fled the Soviet Armed Forces or the Occupational Administration during and subsequent to world war II, and (4) non-returners, who having been sent abroad on commission decided not to return home. About 40% of the sample were postwar emigres, the remainder were wartime emigres. Significantly, the findings of the Inwood Project research \"diverged markedly in several respects\" from those of the Harvard Project on the Soviet Social System.[21]/nAs De-Stalinisation progressed during the second half of the 1950s, Ivan D. London was able to establish a broad range of contacts among Soviet psychologists, and became a leading expert in Soviet psychology in the U. S./nIn 1963 the Londons turned their attention to the People's Republic of China (PRC) a country hidden behind the so-called Bamboo Curtain in East Asia the more the so-called Iron Curtain in Europe was becoming permeable.[22]/nPartially supported by private foundations, including the Smith Richardson Foundation, they were able to support their research on China over a period of twelve years, from 1963 through 1975, in which they took yearly field trips of two to three-month duration to Hong Kong and Taiwan.[23]/nDuring the first half of the 20th century, many academic psychologists endorsed the idea that  their discipline should become more scientific by emulating concepts and methods of traditional physics.[24] During the same time, many traditional physicists were also struggling to reconcile their basic concepts of classical mechanics with the discovery of the principles  of quantum mechanics. Ivan D. London was the first psychologist to argue that psychology would benefit by pursuing an equivalent consideration.[25]/nDuring his studies in mathematics London had been fascinated by the treatises of the German physicist Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976) on quantum mechanics, which he was able to read in the original. Observing, however, it had become the fashion by those who emphasized the necessity and positive value of statistical formulations in psychology to invoke Heisenberg's principle of indeterminacy, London in his treatise/ndemonstrated that this principle, \"as formulated for quantum theory by Heisenberg, is grossly inapplicable for psychology and that,  in consequence, no matter what may be the arguments presented in defense of the statistical approach to psychological problems, Heisenberg's principle of indeterminacy may not be one of them.\"[27]/nIn the same vein, London in his treatise/nalso rejected Kurt Lewin's (1890-1947), so-called \"topological psychology\". \"The claim of 'topological' psychology to deductive rigor\", London concluded, \"is mathematically spurious and results from an unfortunate misapplication of a very generalized branch of mathematics totally unrelated to the needs of psychological theory.\"[29]/nAn inspiration, which assumed fundamental importance for London's methodological life's work, came from Irving Langmuir (1881\u20131957). In his famous speech as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1943, Langmuir had argued that the traditional/quantum distinction in physics had its analogy in many domains of nature beyond physics, including all domains containing convergent and divergent phenomena. He noted:/nLangmuir's convergent/divergent distinction clarified the difference between theories and methods of classical and quantum physics, arguing that each was appropriate for its own domain. Ivan D. London posed a logical question: If physics could benefit from at least two approaches to studying physical phenomena, could psychology benefit from at least two approaches to studying psychological phenomena?/nIn his doctoral thesis, pursuing this question, London proposed that psychological phenomena, like their physical cousins, also showed properties of convergence and divergence, which he called \u2033convergent amplification\u2033 and \u2033divergent amplification\u2033. The former can be seen in small behavioural variations that \"average out\" (converge to an average) over time; examples include reaction times, judgments of distance, athletic performances, and IQ test scores. The latter can be seen in small behavioural variations that amplify their consequences or effects (diverge from an average), including irreversible decisions, disfiguring accidents, random encounters with influential people, technological innovations, and historical events such as Brexit or COVID-19./nThe treatise/ncan be considered London's basic methodological credo. \nLondon suggested that divergently-amplified psychological phenomena have at least two distinguishing properties: multiple and contingent causation. Friendship, for example, can arise from multiple causes such as mutual interests, physical proximity, ethnic background, shared experience, etc. Nonetheless, these causes can influence, and often can change the strength or direction of other relationships. Thus, hypothetically, physical proximity might increase the probability of friendship, but not if a significant age gap impeded shared understandings or lack of a common language/dialect precluded meaningful communication./nDealing with/nLondon argued that complex links of multiple and contingent causation that characterise divergent psychological phenomena cannot be fully understood using simple \"A causes B\" concepts such as those employed in classical physics. Instead, alternative kinds of explanations should be considered to illuminate the networks of influence (\"context effects\") in someone's psychological development or life history. We should expect that these influences will likely vary across people, situations and time, so traditional, \"on average\" summaries might be misleading or invalid.[34] We are more likely to discover recurring patterns within causal networks by aggregating analyses of individual cases than by analyzing aggregations of individual cases. And we are more likely to understand diversity in these patterns by seeing them from diverse perspectives than by eliminating all but the best-fitting one./nFor the very practical purpose of his research, London's methodological considerations grew beyond the psychological discipline. Interviews with refugees had to be conducted because there was no direct access to information from the Soviet Union. To aggregate representative samples was impossible. The researcher had to rely on individual testimonies to retrieve a picture of the social whole. Again, Ivan D. London was the first[25] in the field of studies on communist ruled countries to suggest that the Social Sciences could derive overall benefit from employing at least two approaches. Referring to Wilhelm Windelband's (1848-1915) distinction between the Natural Sciences (Naturwissenschaften) and the Humanities (Geisteswissenschaften)[35] he termed the first conventional approach derived from traditional physics \"nomothetic [...] with its antithetic emphasis on numbers and on the many\". The second approach, which derived from quantum theoretical considerations, London termed \"idiographic [...] with the 'uniqueness of the individual' casting light on the many\"./nIn his 1977 treatise on/nLondon directly called for a paradigm shift in the social sciences. He argued that social science required \"a paradigm fundamentally different from that currently in use which reflects essentially the habits of classical physics.\" Its basic characteristic were \"the prevalence of minor and major events which amplify sequentially in such a way as to converge toward or diverge from expected outcomes.\"  Other characteristics of social science as \"the historicity of its subject matter, the everpresent tension between stability and change, the frequent primacy of phenotypic specificity over genotypic generality, the importance of context and meaning in the constitution of data, and the altering effects of theory on reality, [...] require a change in the role of the investigator so as to include him more intimately in the research process. London considered it useful to substitute an \"orientative sample\" for the usual representative sample \"... to take into account the researcher's new role, especially in the context of amplification.\" The researcher should put himself in the role of a student, clinician or journalist, trying to learn the world through the eyes and from the words of his dialogue partner, looking for differences and similarities in themes of experiences that could account for divergence and convergence.[37]/nLondon believed that the social sciences could and should permanently draw on advances in the physical and biological sciences, in particular, to study phenomena which exhibit heteromorphic or catalytic tendencies, i. e., divergent amplification, within an expanded scientific framework. Together with Warren Thorngate, in his last major methodological treatise of 1981,/nhe, therefore, offered a review of such recent advances. The implications for research and statistical practice in social psychology were discussed and the scientific advantages of analysing social behaviour in multifarious contexts explained. London and Thorngate came to the conclusion, that while new orientations were \"taking hold,  and with considerable success, in the various subdisciplines of biological science\", the social sciences had deplorably \"remained almost isolated from the spreading paradigm.\" \"Not only isolated, but stagnating and crisis-ridden.\" In their view, \"the key to revitalization and progress (had been) in large measure already fashioned conceptually. It needed only \"picking up and further shaping for use in the social sciences.\"/nLondon defined the \"idiographic\" method of research, most extensively applied by his research team in the making of the book \"The Revenge of Heaven: journal of a young Chinese\", as a method \"where in-depth study of the \u2032single case\u2032 reveals and illuminates also the embedding general scene \u2013 a clear recognition of the necessary fusion of the \u2032person and the field\u2032 in any multi-faceted comprehension of man in his surround.\"[39]/nIts characteristics can be summarised in the following three principles of interviewing:/nInterview sessions were carefully prepared to create an atmosphere that fostered peer level communications between the interviewer and respondent. Instead of simply leading the respondents through the sessions via a prepared sequence of questions, forcing them to translate their individual experiences into the researcher's general frame of reference, the interviewer would be prepared to be instructed by his respondent and possibly forced to alter his enquiries. The result could end up being unanticipated, or in other words, what London had typified as \"divergent amplification\"./nTo secure the relevance and the reliability of information generated from refugee interviews the researcher had to meticulously study the respondent's persona, gain familiarity with all details of his daily life, including his likes and dislikes to understand what this particular individual had personally experienced, seen and accomplished. Only through this very personal record, counterchecked with a multitude of other records of that nature, could the interviewer gain visibility into a social reality that lay beyond his reach. The individual perceptions would coalesce to represent the reality of a given society as a whole.[41]/nTogether with his wife Miriam London, who was associated with his scholarly career ever since 1950, first as his research assistant, but more as a scholar in her own right during the second half of their marriage until his death, Ivan D. London developed and practised a research strategy which systematically attempted to exclude deterministic averaging - out tendencies and aimed at capturing the unexpected, the divergent and its amplification.[42]/nMiriam London[43] was born in Philadelphia as Miriam Boulotchnik on June 27, 1923, to a family who had been living in Paris, France, for some years before they immigrated in 1914 with their young son Maurice to the US.[1]/nDetermined to get a college degree, Miriam independently pursued \u2013 and successfully obtained \u2013 scholarship and fellowship awards that fully funded her higher education. At the age of 20 she had earned her A. B. degree in Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania, where she was an excellent student and elected to Phi Beta Kappa. One year later, she earned her A. M. degree at Radcliffe Graduate School, Harvard Department of Slavic Studies./nEarly in 1945 she was appointed an administrative assistant in the Foreign Service Auxiliary and sent to Italy to join a mission that would become the U.S. embassy in Vienna, Austria.[44] Fluent in Russian and French, during her one-and-a-half year sojourn in Europe, she gained experience as a Russian interpreter, studied German and also did some travelling./nAfter returning to the United States in 1946, she met and then married Ivan D. London in 1947.[1] Between 1948 and 1950 she completed course work toward a Ph.D. degree at the University of Chicago. Miriam London did not complete her dissertation and instead accompanied her husband to the Harvard Research Center where she was later also employed. Together with him she went to New York in 1952, where she would work as a research assistant at Brooklyn College and also teach Russian for some time. Miriam London also participated in the Inwood Project on Intercultural Communication. Within the frame of that research project she co-authored a number of essays and reports of her husband.[45]/nWhen China attracted their attention in the early 1960s and the Londons pondered extending their research to East Asia, Miriam London studied the Chinese vernacular in support of that project. Over the years, she attained a fundamental level of fluency in Chinese, adding to her fluency in French and Russian beyond her native English./nA private archive documenting the academic life of Ivan D. London and his wife Miriam London has been transferred to the Hoover Institution Archives at Stanford University in Stanford, California (US) and is registered there as \"Ivan D. London papers\" under the collection number 83060.[50]  It consists of 95 manuscript boxes, two card file boxes and one oversize box (42, 2 linear feet). Boxes 91\u201398 all still closed but eligible to be opened August 5, 2023. \"The remainder of the collection is open for research.\"[50] The collection consists of materials in English, Russian and Chinese and includes correspondence, writings, questionnaires, interview transcripts, notes, reports, memoranda and printed matters relating to social conditions in the Soviet Union and China. The Inwood Project on Intercultural Communication Records makes up the main body of the collection.[51]/nIn more than 30 years of close collaboration Ivan D. London and Miriam London published most papers and research reports under both their names.  In the beginning, Miriam London acted as a research assistant co-authoring her husband's articles and reports. However, in later publications related to China, Miriam London became the primary author, with her husband as co-author. In some cases, papers written by Miriam London were also co-authored by Ta-Ling Lee (born 1933), professor of history at Southern Connecticut State College (US) and associate of the Londons for many years. This continued after the death of Ivan D. London and enabled Miriam London, as a private scholar, the institutional affiliation vital for publication. There is, in fact, only one publication solely authored by Miriam London. However, this publication is included in an anthology of leading scholars of Contemporary China Studies and, hence, demonstrates that not only the Londons as a couple but also Miriam London as an individual scholar enjoyed high esteem in the scholarly world.[52] Her foremost work product, however, was the research report entitled/nThe report, cast in the literary form of a novel, represented a case study of a Chinese high school-student, who fled to Taiwan after participating in Mao's \"Cultural Revolution\" from the summer of 1966 through the fall of 1967. The report was based on information derived from 300 hours of interviews, 400.000 Chinese characters of additional written statements and another 100.000 characters of written responses to further questions the Londons had posed to the respondent. The book was translated into Chinese, German, French and Thai./nIn this project, the role of Ivan D. London had been that of the project leader, methodological mastermind and interviewer. Miriam London designed the outcome of that case study assisted by the linguistic expertise and scrutiny of Professor Ta Ling Lee and Professor Wu Ping-chung.[53][54]/nIn order to present the former Red Guard to the public as \"a real and genuine character\" she chose as a format the autobiographical first person account with Ken Ling, the former Red Guard's pseudonym for the purpose of publishing the report, as the narrator fictitiously reading from his journal. The publication of \"The Revenge of Heaven\" coincided with a radical change of policies of the PRC and the US towards each other. From February 21 through 28, 1972, the then American President, Richard M. Nixon, visited China by invitation of the Peking government. With that visit, for the first time since the establishment of Communist rule on October 1, 1949, the Chinese mainland had become accessible to a larger group of American citizens - specifically, the diplomats, scholars and journalists who accompanied the President. While these American visitors returned home from China deeply impressed by the state of affairs they had been introduced to - no dogs, no flies, no beggars, healthy, well-fed and happily looking citizens, cleaness and modest, but adequate living conditions - the research report of the Londons testified to the contrary. The descriptions Ken Ling delivered about his travelling from his home town Amoy in Southern Fujian up to the North to link-up with Red Guards from other provinces basically resurfaced the classical picture of China during the first half of the 20th century - the land of famine and beggars, breathtaking stench and appalling dirt, prostitution and robbery, and last but not least corruption and embezzlement. The then 16 year old high-school student came across beggars clothed in meager rags who gathered in masses in the railway stations and reached their emaciated arms out for food from the passengers whenever trains came into the station. From the train window, he saw trees stripped off their bark, occasional corpses lying by the tracks, and once even a child's leg. When he visited the countryside high up in Western Fujian he found villages living only on the dregs of squashed sweet potatoes, as their juice was required to be sold to the government, and non-nutritious and tasteless (due to lack of salt) bamboo shoots boiled in water. The peasants had not learnt to read and to write, their language was poor and their bodies were worn out even before they reached adulthood. \"The Revenge of Heaven\" offered a complete contradiction to the euphoric perceptions of Mao's China prevailing in the Western world./nWithin the decade of the 1970s the Londons were able to confirm the veracity of Ken Ling's descriptions, even just on the basis of official reports and documents from the PRC that became available during that time frame. They decided that, in the interest of historical accuracy, it was important in their research to focus on \"hunger in Mao's China\" for some time and  publicly challenge the positions of those experts who championed a distorted projection of the Chinese reality under Mao, and, in some respects had altered it beyond recognition./nMiriam London presented the findings she and her husband had been able to secure on that subject matter in a series of five research papers which at the time provided an extraordinary abundance of source material documenting that from 1960 through 1962, under the leadership of Mao Zedong China had suffered the worst famine in all human history./nMostly attributed to extreme weather conditions and downplayed as being due to some temporary food shortages by Western \"friends of China\" and leading \"China experts\" these so-called \"three bitter years\" caused an estimated human loss of 50 million deaths from starvation and deficiency diseases.[55] It had directly resulted from Mao's ambitious policy of the so-called \"Three Red Banners\". Even in the late 1970s hunger, starvation from food shortage and beggars from disaster-stricken areas roaming the big cities were phenomena of major proportions in the PRC./nHarvard professor John King Fairbank (1907-1991), the most powerful scholar in the American sinological establishment with an enormous influence within the political establishment of the United States, was the most passionate advocate of Maoist China. In the view of the Londons, first and foremost he had to be drawn to account for the misjudgement of China's totalitarian system and the adulation of its erratic leadership in the West. In a public exchange of arguments, implicitly the initiation of a fresh discourse on American policies towards the PRC, Miriam London and her husband pointed to the fact that \"money and prestige add up to power as readily in academe as anywhere else. The academic power centers, thus created,\" they continued, \"not only tend to nurture such ills as 'consensus scholarship', whereby 'top scholars' agree to agree about certain data and methods, in this way establishing an unassailable 'authoritative position', these centers can also function to bury or discredit the alternative viewpoints so necessary to the pursuit of knowledge.\" And they asked \"the powerful sinological establishment at Harvard and its academic outposts\" whether \"accurate knowledge of the flesh-and-blood realities of China under Mao emerged from their generously financed research, or rather from the works of a few outsiders and foreigners, often operating on a shoestring.\"[61]/n\"The Revenge of Heaven\" evolved within the context of the much broader scale, in terms of time frame and substance, research on the PRC being engaged in by Ivan D. and Miriam London. The Londons had not anticipated publishing a special research account of the proportions of a whole book when they started interviewing the former Red Guard (aka Ken Ling) in the summer of 1969. The same can be said of their studies on \"hunger in China\". These studies resulted from the fact, that within the academe their book was heavily criticized - not only by sinologists, but economists and scholars of other social science disciplines as well -  on the basis of the popular believe that \"whatever else you can say about Mao, at least everyone in China now gets enough food\".[62] However, their research on the social system of the PRC was by far more diverse than in hindsight it would seem after the Londons had become renowned for belonging to the very few scholars worldwide who had been honest and brave enough to tell the truth about hunger and beggars in China long before the Communist leaders of that country themselves discovered the truth.[63] The real scope of the London's research work on China can be measured by the selection of titles listed below:/nIf it makes sense at all after more than 30 years of their close collaboration, to evaluate the significance and accomplishments of Ivan D. and Miriam London separately, it seems appropriate on one hand to emphasize the methodology Ivan D. London contributed to the social sciences, in particular, to psychology and political science. His theoretical conceptualization of an idiographic approach supplementing the conventional nomothetic way of scientific dealing with social phenomena has remained valuable in the context of method reflection up to the present. The application of that approach \u2013 often poked fun at, if not bluntly disparaged by the \"experts\" in the early 1970s \u2013 was finally recognized as a revolutionary accomplishment. Indeed, \"the \u2032uniqueness of the individual\u2032 cast light on the many\".[72] On the other hand, Miriam London was the one \"who possessed the requisite literary sense and skill\", as Ivan D. London himself observed,[73] for transforming the results of their in-depth research into reports of various refinement ranging from novel to scholarly essay and scientific argument./nThe unorthodox novel-like research report \"The Revenge of Heaven\" and a number of rather conventional research reports unmasked the prevailing sinological orthodoxy. That was doubtlessly both the Londons' accomplishment. As outsiders to the field of Contemporary Chinas Studies, they taught a lesson of timeless validity to the academe all over the non-communist world: No political system can camouflage the social and economic conditions of a given country when social science principles are rigorously employed. It only takes intellectual honesty and an appropriate method to tear down the barriers intended to hide reality./nWords of praise and admiration for the scholarly contributions of Ivan D. and Miriam London to Contemporary China Studies are scattered in various monographs, articles in anthologies and footnotes to scholarly essays. Out of gratitude for their research accomplishments, J\u00fcrgen Domes (1932-2001), professor of political science, University of the Saarland in Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany, dedicated to them his study of the Sociology of the People's Republic of China, published in German in 1980.[74] After Ivan D. London's death in 1983, Domes in 1985 dedicated to Ivan D. London his English monograph \"The Government and Politics of the PRC.

According to his memoirs, J\u00falio was called late at night by other anxious students, and by the next morning he had provided four different essays on \"Hope\", at 400 r\u00e9is a piece.  He kept on this activity for the rest of the year, writing on \"Hate\", \"Nostalgia\", and whatever else the teacher demanded./nMany years later he met his teacher, Silva Ramos, and told him of those dubious activities. When Silva Ramos introduced him jokingly to Raul Pederneiras as a \"merchant of Hope and Hate\", he got from the man prophetic advice: \"Forget Hate and go on selling Hope. Take up this poetic profession, Merchant of Hope: since that business is profitable for the buyer, and even more so for the seller.\"[citation needed]/nJ\u00falio began to write tales on his own while still in his teens but did not impress the critics in his family. His brother Jo\u00e3o Batista recalls that J\u00falio's tales were full of superfluous characters with bizarre names like \"Mardukbarian\" or \"Protochol\u00f3ski\".[citation needed]/nIn 1918, at the age of 23, J\u00falio C\u00e9sar presented five of his tales to the editor of the newspaper O Imparcial, where he worked, but his boss did not even look at them.  Undaunted, J\u00falio picked up the manuscripts and brought them back a few days later, this time pretending that they were translations of the work of a certain \"R. S. Slade,\" supposedly the rage in New York City.  The first of those tales, The Jew's Revenge, was published in the front page of the next issue of the newspaper; and the rest followed suit./nThis experience convinced J\u00falio to assume a \"foreign\" pen name.  He chose an Arabian identity \u2014 because, as he declared in an interview, the Arabs were unsurpassed in the art of storytelling. For the next seven years he prepared himself by studying Arabic and reading all he could on Islamic culture. In 1925, he sold the idea of a series of tales on Oriental themes to Irineu Marinho, editor of the newspaper A Noite (which would later become a huge Brazilian media conglomerate, the Organiza\u00e7\u00f5es Globo).  His stories, published in the column Contos de Malba Tahan (\"Tales of Malba Tahan\"), were attributed to a fictitious Arabian scholar of that name, and ostensibly translated by an equally fictitious \"Professor Breno Alencar Bianco\"./nWhether for the catchy pseudonym, or (more likely) for the author's lively style and imagination, his books were a resounding success, and he became a national celebrity.  Even though his identity soon was known to everybody, he continued to use the name of Malba Tahan in his public life.  He had a rubber stamp made with that name in Arabic script, which he used when grading his student's homework; and, in 1952 \u2014 by special permission of Brazilian President Get\u00falio Vargas \u2014 he added \"Malba Tahan\" to his own legal name. [4]/nBefore becoming a teacher, he worked for a time as general assistant at the National Library./nJ\u00falio C\u00e9sar graduated as an elementary schoolteacher at the Escola Normal do Distrito Federal in Rio de Janeiro, and as a civil engineer at the Escola Polit\u00e9cnica in 1913. He started lecturing as a substitute teacher at the Col\u00e9gio Pedro II, and later became a teacher at the Escola Normal./nHe began teaching history, geography and physics, and only later moved to mathematics./nIn time he became Chair at the Col\u00e9gio Pedro II, at the Instituto de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o, at the teacher's school of the Universidade do Brasil (which would become the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro) and at the National School of Education, where he got the title of Professor Emeritus./nBesides his classes at the teacher's school, he delivered over 2000 lectures on the teaching of mathematics and wrote many books on the subject. In all his works J\u00falio defended the use of games as teaching aids, and the replacement of chalk-and-blackboard lectures by \"mathematics laboratories\" where students could engage in creative activities, self-study, and object manipulation \u2014 a proposal that was seen as heretical at the time./nIn the Brazilian 0-to-10 grading system, J\u00falio would never give a zero grade. \"Why give a zero, when there are so many numbers to choose from?\" he used to say.  He would give the brightest students the task of teaching the weaker ones: \"by the end of the first semester, they would all be above the pass line.\" he claimed./nWhile his methods and style charmed all his students, he had the opposition of many of his colleagues, who found his approach of connecting mathematics to everyday life as demeaning./nJulio C\u00e9sar also spread his message through radio programmes of several stations in Rio de Janeiro, including the R\u00e1dio Nacional, Radio Clube, and R\u00e1dio Mayrink Veiga, as well as in television, at the TV Tupi of Rio and the TV Cultura of S\u00e3o Paulo./nJ\u00falio C\u00e9sar's last public lecture was delivered in Recife, at the age of 79, to an audience of future teachers. It was about the art of storytelling. Back to his hotel room he apparently suffered a heart attack and expired./nHe had left instructions for his funeral. He did not want people to wear black: quoting a song by Noel Rosa, he explained that \"Black clothes are vanities/of those who enjoy fancy dress;/I only wish for your memories/and memories are colorless\"./nJ\u00falio was an energetic campaigner for the cause of the Hanseniacs (lepers), who had historically been banned and confined in leper colonies. For over 10 years he edited the magazine Dami\u00e3o, which preached the end of the prejudice and re-incorporation of former inmates into the society.

The Leavitt path algebras are so-named because they are constructed from the path algebra of a graph and they also generalize Leavitt algebras./nLeavitt path algebras have been investigated by dozens of mathematicians since their introduction, and Abrams has been instrumental in the development of the theory.[9]  The study of Leavitt path algebras has also promoted interactions between Analysis and Algebra, and there have been multiple conference on Leavitt path algebras aimed at bringing algebraists and analysts together to collaborate and share ideas.[10][11][12]  Abrams is also one of the coauthors, with Pere Ara and Mercedes Siles Molina, of the book Leavitt path algebras: a primer and handbook,[13] published by Springer.

Born in Normandy, he is believed to have been related to Julian des Murs who was secretary to Charles V of France. The suggested birth year for Muris is based on a murder of a cleric on September 7, 1310, which Muris was allegedly a part of. Muris would have been at least 14 to assume the responsibility for the crime, suggesting his birth year to be sometime in the 1290s. He was convicted and banished to Cyprus for seven years for punishment. The aloof and haphazard movements of his life have been blamed on this early punishment.[2]/nBy 1318 records indicate that Muris was living in \u00c9vreux although he was actively taking part in scholastic endeavors in Paris. An explicit of his writings indicate that he was a resident in the Coll\u00e8ge de Sorbonne until around 1325. During this time it is believed that he travelled freely, making trips to the town of Bernay to observe the solar eclipse of 1321. However, the double monastery of Fontevraud Abbey was where he settled in March 1326. He remained associated with the institution until 1332 or 1333 when he returned to \u00c9vreux. Financial records in Muris\u2019 own hand from 1336 indicate that he took up residence in Paris in that year. In 1342 he was one of six canons of the collegiate church in M\u00e9zi\u00e8res-en-Brenne. In 1344, he was invited to Avignon by Pope Clement VI to participate in the calendar reform. The final date associated to Muris is 1345 in conjunction with the reforms that took place in Avignon.[2]/nMuch of his writings were finished in the early decades of his life with a major gap in activity that can be filled with astronomical observations. Though his mathematical and astronomical writings \u2013 his most comprehensive being Quadripartitum numerorum from 1343 \u2013 were well regarded, influential, and transmitted in many manuscripts, his musical writings were more widely circulated. Muris wrote five treatises on music: Notitia artis musicae (1319\u201321), Compendium musicae practicae (c. 1322), Musica speculativa secundum Boetium (1323), Libellus cantus mensurabilis (c. 1340), and Ars contrapuncti (post 1340) (all dates are suggested dates by U.

When Machover and Orr followed this by criticising the party's adherence to the Soviet line, and called for the publication of the party's history, they were expelled.

During the Second World War when bacon became rationed in 1940, she was involved in allocating bacon rations for London.[4]/nAt the end of the Second World War, Cunliffe interrupted her career to undertake voluntary relief work in Europe, from 1945 to 1947, with the Guide International Service. The service had been formed from specially trained ex-Girl Guide volunteers to help with the rehabilitation of Europe after the war. Cunliffe was among the first civilians to go into Belsen Concentration Camp in 1945,[5] where the volunteers oversaw the so-called \"human laundry\", the delousing of the inmates./nIn 1947 Cunliffe resumed her professional career by accepting a post as statistician at the Dublin brewers Arthur Guinness Son & Co., where she worked until 1970. In 1955 she took on the role of head of the statistics department.[4] In this role, she developed important principles of experimental methods that are taught to this day. In the most famous example, she redesigned the instructions for quality control workers who were tasked to either accept or reject handmade beer barrels.[6] Before Cunliffe's redesign, workers accepted barrels by rolling them downhill and rejected barrels by pushing them uphill, the more difficult task; thus, workers were biased to accept barrels even if they were flawed. Cunliffe redesigned the quality control work station so that it was equally easy to reject or accept a barrel, eliminating the prior bias and saving Guinness money in the process. She was informed that due to a policy of only appointing men to the Board of Directors, she would not be made director despite her long career and experimental work.[7]/nIn 1970 she became Head of Research Unit at the Home Office, before in 1972 being appointed Director of Statistics at the Home Office, a post she held until 1977. She was the first woman to reach this grade in the British Government Statistical Service. During her time at the Home Office she expanded the department's statistical and support staff, and established a dedicated computing team.[8] She acknowledged problems with migration figures, after an error was discovered where the number of passengers leaving the country had been overcounted. As a result, she set up an inquiry led by Claus Moser, the head of the Central Statistical Office at the time.[4] She was a prison visitor, and promoted the use of statistics in criminal justice policy. She presented the Home Secretary, Roy Jenkins, with international comparisons to show that capital punishment had no effect on murder rates.[8][9]/nAfter compulsory retirement from the Civil Service at the age of 60, she was later Statistical Adviser to the Committee of Enquiry into the Engineering Profession from 1978 to 1980.

The French Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences both supported practical research into tidal effects, and offered a prize for the best essay to establish the topic on a sound mathematical and theoretical footing./nThree essays were selected for prizes, all of them by supporters of Newtonian theory. They were Daniel Bernoulli, Leonhard Euler, and Colin Maclaurin. However, it was rumoured by Pierre Louis Maupertuis that the reason that Cavalleri was added to the list of winners was that one influential judge among those selecting the winning essays was Ren\u00e9 Antoine Ferchault de R\u00e9aumur, who favoured Decartes' vortex theory, and who insisted that at least one winner should be a supporter of that view, though by that time it was rapidly losing ground and leading workers in the field already were rejecting it. As a sop for R\u00e9aumur, his colleagues consented to include an arbitrary choice of essay supporting the vorticist view. Cavalleri not only was fairly prominent in his own right, but had recently won two prizes from the Acad\u00e9mie de Bordeaux for his essays: \"Opacit\u00e9 et diaphan\u00e9it\u00e9 des corps\" in 1738 and \"Chaleur et froideur des eaux min\u00e9rales\" in 1739, so he was a convenient choice.[3]/nThough competent, Cavalleri is little remembered. He was perhaps doubly unfortunate; firstly, in an age that produced figures such as the Bernoulli family, Euler, Lacaille, D'Alembert, Reaumur, and Lagrange, even a prominent professor of mathematics is easy to overlook. Secondly, Cavalleri's essay on tides, though penetrating in that he recognised debatable points in both Cartesian and Newtonian theory, amounted to the last substantial support for the Cartesian theory of vortices; in effect a futile rearguard action. It is true that Fontenelle has been referred to as the last defender of the vortices,[4] but unlike Cavalleri he wrote as an interpreter and populariser, rather than as an analyst or formulator of material theory./nOn the one hand Cavalleri's objection to Descartes' theory was mainly that it effectively dismissed the obvious tidal influence of the sun. On the other he rejected Newton's theory of remote gravitational attraction. The latter idea might seem naive, but even in 21st century theoretical physics there are echoes of dissatisfaction with the concept of action at a distance. He tried to construct a theoretical basis for an inverse square law of gravitational attraction arising from Cartesian vortices. Newton however, had already raised theoretical objections to Descartes' vortex theory, and Cavalleri not only failed to refute the objections, but misinterpreted a modified vortex theory by Philippe Villemot[5] which attempted to reconcile vortices with Newtonian attraction.[6]/nCavalleri's essay,[7] although having received the prize from the Acad\u00e9mie, more or less lapsed into obscurity thereafter. Possibly this was because of its being biased towards Cartesian rather than Newtonian gravitational theory; Pope Benedict XIV had ordered two priests to produce a new, annotated edition of Newton's Principia.

He studied mathematics under Augustus De Morgan, and botany under John Lindley at University College London. Guthrie obtained his B.A. in 1850, and LL.B. in 1852 with first class honours. While colouring a map of the counties of England, he noticed that at least four colours were required so that no two regions sharing a common border were the same colour. He postulated that four colours would be sufficient to colour any map.  This became known as the Four Color Problem, and remained one of the most famous unsolved problems in topology for more than a century until it was eventually proven in 1976 using a lengthy computer-aided proof./nGuthrie arrived in South Africa on 10 April 1861 and was met and entertained by Dr Dale (later Sir Langham Dale), who was instrumental in the establishing of the University of the Cape of Good Hope in June 1873. Guthrie took up the post of mathematics master at the Graaff-Reinet College. While there he gave a course of acclaimed public lectures on botany in 1862 and thus started a lifelong friendship with local resident Harry Bolus. He advised Bolus to take up the study of botany to ease his grief at the loss of his six-year-old son. When Bolus left for Cape Town a few years later, he persuaded Guthrie to move there as well in 1875. For a while, he practised at the Bar and edited a newspaper before becoming the professor of mathematics at the South African College, which later became the University of Cape Town.

However, he continued lecturing as a privatdozent until 1938,[3][6] when he was forced to resign as a consequence of the \"Anschluss\".[7] On 28\u201329 June 1942, he was deported with transport IV/2, \u010d. 621 to Theresienstadt,[3][5][8] where he was murdered on 26 July 1942.[1]/nPinl & Dick (1974, p.\u00a0202) list 35 publications in the bibliography appended to his obituary, and also a search performed on the \"Jahrbuch \u00fcber die Fortschritte der Mathematik\" database results in a list 35 mathematical works authored by him, spanning a period of time from 1891 to 1940.[9] However, Hlawka (2007) cites two papers on actuarial mathematics which do not appear in these two bibliographical lists and Binder's bibliography of Tauber's works (1984, pp.\u00a0163\u2013166), while listing 71 entries including the ones in the bibliography of Pinl & Dick (1974, p.\u00a0202) and the two cited by Hlawka, does not includes the short note (Tauber 1895) so the exact number of his works is not known. According to Hlawka (2007), his scientific research can be divided into three areas: the first one comprises his work on the theory of functions of a complex variable and on potential theory, the second one includes works on linear differential equations and on the Gamma function, while the last one includes his contributions to actuarial science.[3] Pinl & Dick (1974, p.\u00a0202) give a more detailed list of research topics Tauber worked on, though it is restricted to mathematical analysis and geometric topics: some of them are infinite series, Fourier series, spherical harmonics, the theory of quaternions, analytic and descriptive geometry.[10] Tauber's most important scientific contributions belong to the first of his research areas,[11] even if his work on potential theory has been overshadowed by the one of Aleksandr Lyapunov.[3]/nHis most important article is (Tauber 1897).[3] In this paper, he succeeded in proving a converse to Abel's theorem for the first time:[12] this result was the starting point of numerous investigations,[3] leading to the proof and to applications of several theorems of such kind for various summability methods. The statement of these theorems has a standard structure: if a series \u2211\u00a0an is summable according to a given summability method and satisfies an additional condition, called \"Tauberian condition\",[13] then it is a convergent series.[14] Starting from 1913 onward, G. H. Hardy and J. E. Littlewood used the term Tauberian to identify this class of theorems.[15] Describing with a little more detail Tauber's 1897 work, it can be said that his main achievements are the following two theorems:[16][17]/nThis theorem is, according to Korevaar (2004, p.\u00a010),[19] the forerunner of all Tauberian theory: the condition an\u00a0=\u00a0\u03bf(n\u22121) is the first Tauberian condition, which later had many profound generalizations.[20] In the remaining part of his paper, by using the theorem above,[21] Tauber proved the following, more general result:[22]/nThis result is not a trivial consequence of Tauber's first theorem.[24] The greater generality of this result with respect to the former one is due to the fact it proves the exact equivalence between ordinary convergence on one side and Abel summability (condition 1) jointly with Tauberian condition (condition 2) on the other. Chatterji (1984, pp.\u00a0169\u2013170) claims that this latter result must have appeared to Tauber much more complete and satisfying respect to the former one as it states a necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence of a series while the former one was simply a stepping stone to it: the only reason why Tauber's second theorem is not mentioned very often seems to be that it has no profound generalization as the first one has,[25] though it has its rightful place in all detailed developments of summability of series.[23][25]/nFrederick W. King\u00a0(2009,\u2002p. 3) writes that Tauber contributed at an early stage to theory of the now called \"Hilbert transform\", anticipating with his contribution the works of Hilbert and Hardy in such a way that the transform should perhaps bear their three names.[26] Precisely, Tauber (1891) considers the real part \u03c6 and imaginary part \u03c8 of a power series f,[27][28]/nwhere/nUnder the hypothesis that r is less than the convergence radius Rf of the power series f, Tauber proves that \u03c6 and \u03c8 satisfy the two following equations:/nAssuming then r\u00a0=\u00a0Rf, he is also able to prove that the above equations still hold if \u03c6 and \u03c8 are only absolutely integrable:[30] this result is equivalent to defining the Hilbert transform on the circle since, after some calculations exploiting the periodicity of the functions involved, it can be proved that (1) and (2) are equivalent to the following pair of Hilbert transforms:[31]/nFinally, it is perhaps worth pointing out an application of the results of (Tauber 1891), given (without proof) by Tauber himself in the short research announce (Tauber 1895):", "4388876": "Herbert Eric Huppert FRS FRSN (born 26 November 1943[2]) is a British geophysicist.

His unusual abilities were soon recognized and he quickly moved on to graduate classes and seminars with Tarski and became part of the group that surrounded him, including me and Richard Montague; so it was at that time that we became friends.  Scott was clearly in line to do a Ph. D. with Tarski, but they had a falling out for reasons explained in our biography.[1]  Upset by that, Scott left for Princeton where he finished with a Ph. D. under Alonzo Church.  But it was not long before the relationship between them was mended to the point that Tarski could say to him, \"I hope I can call you my student.\"/nAfter completing his Ph.D. studies, he moved to the University of Chicago, working as an instructor there until 1960.  In 1959, he published a joint paper with Michael O. Rabin, a colleague from Princeton, titled Finite Automata and Their Decision Problem (Scott and Rabin 1959) which introduced the idea of nondeterministic machines to automata theory. This work led to the joint bestowal of the Turing Award on the two, for the introduction of this fundamental concept of computational complexity theory./nScott took up a post as Assistant Professor of Mathematics, back at the University of California, Berkeley, and involved himself with classical issues in mathematical logic, especially set theory and Tarskian model theory. He proved that the axiom of constructibility is incompatible with the existence of a measurable cardinal, a result considered seminal in the evolution of set theory.[2]/nDuring this period he started supervising Ph.D. students, such as James Halpern (Contributions to the Study of the Independence of the Axiom of Choice) and Edgar Lopez-Escobar (Infinitely Long Formulas with Countable Quantifier Degrees)./nScott also began working on modal logic in this period, beginning a collaboration with John Lemmon, who moved to Claremont, California, in 1963.  Scott was especially interested in Arthur Prior's approach to tense logic and the connection to the treatment of time in natural-language semantics, and began collaborating with Richard Montague (Copeland 2004), whom he had known from his days as an undergraduate at Berkeley.  Later, Scott and Montague independently discovered an important generalisation of Kripke semantics for modal and tense logic, called Scott-Montague semantics (Scott 1970)./nJohn Lemmon and Scott began work on a modal-logic textbook that was interrupted by Lemmon's death in 1966.  Scott circulated the incomplete monograph amongst colleagues, introducing a number of important techniques in the semantics of model theory, most importantly presenting a refinement of canonical model that became standard, and introducing the technique of constructing models through filtrations, both of which are core concepts in modern Kripke semantics (Blackburn, de Rijke, and Venema, 2001).  Scott eventually published the work as An Introduction to Modal Logic (Lemmon & Scott, 1977)./nFollowing an initial observation of Robert Solovay, Scott formulated the concept of Boolean-valued model, as Solovay and Petr Vop\u011bnka did likewise at around the same time. In 1967, Scott published a paper, A Proof of the Independence of the Continuum Hypothesis, in which he used Boolean-valued models to provide an alternate analysis of the independence of the continuum hypothesis to that provided by Paul Cohen.

He is the author of the Barkley Model of excitable media[5][6]\nand discoverer of the role of Euclidean symmetry in spiral-wave dynamics.[7]/nIn 1997, Laurette Tuckerman and Dwight Barkley coined the term \"bifurcation analysis for time steppers\" for techniques involving the modification of time-stepping computer codes to perform the tasks of bifurcation analysis.[8] He has applied this approach in several areas of fluid dynamics, in particular to stability analysis of the cylinder wake[9] and of the backward-facing step.[10]/nBarkley also works on the transition to turbulence in shear flows, including the formation of turbulent-laminar bands[11][12] and the critical point for pipe flow.[13][14] Exploiting an analogy with the transition between excitable and bistable media, Barkley derived a model for pipe flow which captures most features of transition to turbulence, in particular the behavior of turbulent regions called puffs and slugs.[15][16]/nHe is also known for deriving an equation to estimate how long it will be until a child in a car asks the question \"are we there yet?\"[17]/nIn 2005 he was awarded the J.

He worked as a programmer for Honeywell. After twelve years, his position was eliminated as part of a routine cutback, and Ammann ended up working as a mail sorter for a post office./nIn 1975, Ammann read an announcement by Martin Gardner of new work by Roger Penrose. Penrose had discovered two simple sets of aperiodic tiles, each consisting of just two quadrilaterals. Since Penrose was taking out a patent, he wasn't ready to publish them, and Gardner's description was rather vague. Ammann wrote a letter to Gardner, describing his own work, which duplicated one of Penrose's sets, plus a foursome of \"golden rhombohedra\" that formed aperiodic tilings in space.[1]/nMore letters followed, and Ammann became a correspondent with many of the professional researchers. He discovered several new aperiodic tilings, each among the simplest known examples of aperiodic sets of tiles. He also showed how to generate tilings using lines in the plane as guides for lines marked on the tiles, now called \"Ammann bars\"./nThe discovery of quasicrystals in 1982 changed the status of aperiodic tilings and Ammann's work from mere recreational mathematics to respectable academic research./nAfter more than ten years of coaxing, he agreed to meet various professionals in person, and eventually even went to two conferences and delivered a lecture at each. Afterwards, Ammann dropped out of sight, and died of a heart attack a few years later.  News of his death did not reach the research community for a few more years./nFive sets of tiles discovered by Ammann were described in Tilings and Patterns[2] and later, in collaboration with the authors of the book, he published a paper[3] proving the aperiodicity for four of them. Ammann's discoveries came to notice only after Penrose had published his own discovery and gained priority. In 1981 de Bruijn exposed the cut and project method  and in 1984 came the sensational news about Shechtman quasicrystals which promoted the Penrose tiling  to fame. But in 1982 Beenker published a similar mathematical explanation for the octagonal case which became known as the Ammann\u2013Beenker tiling.[4] In 1987 Wang, Chen and Kuo announced the discovery of a quasicrystal with octagonal symmetry.[5] The decagonal covering of the Penrose tiling was proposed in 1996 and two years later Ben Abraham and G\u00e4hler proposed an octagonal variant for the Ammann\u2013Beenker tiling.[6] Ammann's name  became that of the perennial second.

He is regarded as the founder of linear programming. He was the winner of the Stalin Prize in 1949 and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1975./nKantorovich was born on 19 January 1912, to a Russian Jewish family.[1] His father was a doctor practicing in Saint Petersburg.[2] In 1926, at the age of fourteen, he began his studies at Leningrad State University. He graduated from the Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics in 1930, and began his graduate studies. In 1934, at the age of 22 years, he became a full professor./nLater, Kantorovich worked for the Soviet government. He was given the task of optimizing production in a plywood industry. He devised the mathematical technique now known as linear programming in 1939, some years before it was advanced by George Dantzig. He authored several books including The Mathematical Method of Production Planning and Organization (Russian original 1939), The Best Uses of Economic Resources (Russian original 1959), and, with Vladimir Ivanovich Krylov, Approximate methods of higher analysis (Russian original 1936).[3] For his work, Kantorovich was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1949./nAfter 1939, he became a professor at Military Engineering-Technical University. During the Siege of Leningrad, Kantorovich was a professor at VITU of Navy and worked on safety of the Road of Life. He calculated the optimal distance between cars on ice in dependence of the thickness of ice and the temperature of the air. In December 1941 and January 1942, Kantorovich walked himself between cars driving on the ice of Lake Ladoga on the Road of Life to ensure that cars did not sink. However, many cars with food for survivors of the siege were destroyed by the German airstrikes. For his feat and courage Kantorovich was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War, and was decorated with the medal For Defense of Leningrad./nIn 1948 Kantorovich was assigned to the atomic project of the USSR./nAfter 1960, Kantorovich lived and worked in Novosibirsk, where he created and took charge of the Department of Computational Mathematics in Novosibirsk State University.[4]/nThe Nobel Memorial Prize, which he shared with Tjalling Koopmans, was given \"for their contributions to the theory of optimum allocation of resources.\"/nIn mathematical analysis, Kantorovich had important results in functional analysis, approximation theory, and operator theory./nIn particular, Kantorovich formulated some fundamental results in the theory of normed vector lattices, especially in Dedekind complete vector lattices called \"K-spaces\" which are now referred to as \"Kantorovich spaces\" in his honor./nKantorovich showed that functional analysis could be used in the analysis of iterative methods, obtaining the Kantorovich inequalities on the convergence rate of the gradient method and of Newton's method (see the Kantorovich theorem)./nKantorovich considered infinite-dimensional optimization problems, such as the Kantorovich-Monge problem in transport theory. His analysis proposed the Kantorovich\u2013Rubinstein metric, which is used in probability theory, in the theory of the weak convergence of probability measures.", "587876": "Geminiano Montanari (1 June 1633 \u2013 13 October 1687) was an Italian astronomer, lens-maker, and proponent of the experimental approach to science. He was a member of various learned academies, notably the Accademia dei Gelati. Montanari's famous students include Domenico Guglielmini, Francesco Bianchini, Gianantonio Davia and Luigi Ferdinando Marsili./nHe is best known for his observation, made around 1667, that the second-brightest star (called Algol as derived from its name in Arabic) in the constellation of Perseus varied in brightness.  It is likely that others had observed this effect before, but Montanari was the first named astronomer to record it.  The star's names in Arabic, Hebrew and other languages, all of which have a meaning of \"ghoul\" or \"demon\", imply that its unusual behaviour had long been recognised./nMontanari was born in Modena on June 1, 1633. The son of Giovanni Montanari and Margherita Zanasi, he was left fatherless at age ten. Montanari began his studies in Modena. At twenty he went to Florence to study law; he remained there for 3 years. In Florence he participated in the observations of the phases of Saturn made after the publication of Huygens' Systema Saturnium. In 1656 Montanari left Florence and moved to Salzburg, Austria, where he took a law degree in the same year. Thanks to the influence of Paolo del Buono, one of Galileo's last direct disciples and Florentine diplomat at the imperial court, he pursued the mathematical studies begun in Modena at the age of thirteen./nAt the beginning of 1661 Montanari became court philosopher and mathematician in Modena. In the meantime the Modenese scientist had made acquaintance with Marquis Cornelio Malvasia, an influential senator and patron of science of Bologna who had built in his country house near Modena an astronomical observatory. Montanari helped Malvasia to complete his Ephemerides (Modena, 1662) and, after the death of Alfonso d'Este in July 1662, he left the court of Modena and pursued his astronomical studies and observations thanks to the patronage of the marquis. Malvasia also managed to get his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 a chair of mathematics at the University of Bologna, to which Montanari was appointed by the Senate in December 1664. Montanari lectured in the afternoon chair while the Bolognese Pietro Mengoli, a renowned disciple of Cavalieri and a parish priest, occupied the morning chair. A third mathematical lectureship was held by Giovanni Domenico Cassini, a close friend of Montanari's./nIn Bologna Montanari drew an accurate map of the Moon using an ocular micrometer of his own making. He also made observations on capillarity and other problems in statics, and suggested that the viscosity of a liquid depended on the shape of its molecules. In 1665 Montanari organized the Accademia della Traccia, the precursor to the Accademia degli Inquieti and the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna. The academy was established the year after Montanari's call to the University, and in the first two years of activity it met at the house of a Bolognese patrician, the Abbot Carlo Antonio Sampieri. From about 1667-1668 to 1677, the meetings were held at Montanari's home. Montanari was a keen astronomical observer, as demonstrated by the observations he made of the meteor that crossed the sky of central Italy on 21 March 1676 or those of the comet of 1682, the same observed by Edmond Halley. Montanari's observations of the great comet of 1680 are mentioned twice in the third volume of Newton's Principia.[1] Montanari published several tracts intended to discredit astrological prognostication. In 1675, he perpetrated a deliberate hoax by writing an astrological almanac entirely at random, to show that predictions made by chance were as likely to be fulfilled as those made by astrology. In the period shortly after Galileo Galilei, experimentalists like Montanari were engaged in a battle against the more mystical views of scientists such as Donato Rossetti, a pupil of Borelli. Montanari, on the contrary, drew a clear line of metaphysical neutrality, based on a sharp distinction between metaphysics and natural philosophy.[2]/nIn July 1678 Montanari was appointed to the new Paduan chair of astronomy and meteorology.[3] Almost all records of this period of his life have been lost. A letter survives from 1682 recording a sighting of Halley's Comet. He also wrote on economics, observing that demand for a particular commodity was fixed, and making comments on coinage and the value of money (1683)./nMontanari was a close friend of the architect Guarino Guarini. In 1678 Guarini helped organize Montanari's debate with the latter's archenemy Donato Rossetti in Turin.[4]/nA crater on the Moon, at 45.8S, 20.6W, is named after him./nTo students of economics Montanari is known by his two works on coins, written abont 1680, and published seventy years later by Argelati in his collection of works on coins, and afterwards reproduced in the collection of Pietro Custodi. These works possess much merit notwithstanding the evident traces of the influence of Bodin \u2013 an influence greatly felt by all thinkers at that period./nFluent and animated in style, Montanari freely criticises the mistaken views held in his day on the coinage question, and the injurious effect of alterations in coins, and the raising their nominal value; and points out the rules which should be observed in coining money at the mints. His investigations on money necessarily lead him to an examination of the question of value. He combats the idea of an invariable relation of the value between gold and silver asserted by Bodin and Scaruffi. He reduces the laws of value to the element of scarcity \u2013 understanding scarcity not as absolute, but relative to the extent of the demand./nIn his researches, says Graziani, Montanari succeeds in explaining all the general phenomena of value, though without thoroughly understanding the intricate and difficult subject \u2013 the value of money.[5]", "58521704": "Concha Maria G\u00f3mez is an American mathematician.

In 1999, Lipton was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for the application of computer science theory to practice./nIn 1980, along with Richard M. Karp, Lipton proved that if SAT can be solved by Boolean circuits with a polynomial number of logic gates, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its second level./nShowing that a program P has some property is a simple process if the actions inside the program are uninterruptible. However, when the action is interruptible, Lipton showed that through a type of reduction and analysis, it can be shown that the reduced program has that property if and only if the original program has the property.[2] If the reduction is done by treating interruptible operations as one large uninterruptible action, even with these relaxed conditions properties can be proven for a program P. Thus, correctness proofs of a parallel system can often be greatly simplified./nLipton studied and created database security models on how and when to restrict the queries made by users of a database such that private or secret information will not be leaked.[3] For example, querying a database of campaign donations could allow the user to discover the individual donations to political candidates or organizations. If given access to averages of data and unrestricted query access, a user could exploit the properties of those averages to gain illicit information. These queries are considered to have large \"overlap\" creating the insecurity. By bounding the \"overlap\" and number of queries, a secure database can be achieved./nRichard Lipton with Andrew Tomkins introduced a randomized online interval scheduling algorithm, the 2-size version being strongly competitive, and the k-size version achieving O(log\n\n\n\n\n\u25b3\n\n1\n+\n\u03f5\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\vartriangle ^{1+\\epsilon }}\n\n), as well as demonstrating a theoretical lower-bound of O(log\n\n\n\n\u25b3\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\vartriangle }\n\n).[4] This algorithm uses a private-coin for randomization and a \"virtual\" choice to fool a medium adversary./nBeing presented with an event the user must decide whether or not to include the event in the schedule. The 2-size virtual algorithm is described by how it reacts to 1-interval or k-intervals being presented by the adversary:/nAgain, this 2-size algorithm is shown to be strongly-competitive. The generalized k-size algorithm which is similar to the 2-size algorithm is then shown to be O(log\n\n\n\n\n\u25b3\n\n1\n+\n\u03f5\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\vartriangle ^{1+\\epsilon }}\n\n)-competitive./nLipton showed that randomized testing can be provably useful, given the problem satisfied certain properties.[5] Proving correctness of a program is one of the most important problems presented in computer science. Typically in randomized testing, in order to attain a 1/1000 chance of an error, 1000 tests must be run. However Lipton shows that if a problem has \"easy\" sub-parts, repeated black-box testing can attain cr error rate, with c a constant less than 1 and r being the number of tests. Therefore, the probability of error goes to zero exponentially fast as r grows./nThis technique is useful to check the correctness of many types of problems./nIn the area of game theory, more specifically of non-cooperative games, Lipton together with E. Markakis and A. Mehta proved[6] the existence of epsilon-equilibrium strategies with support logarithmic in the number of pure strategies. Furthermore, the payoff of such strategies can epsilon-approximate the payoffs of exact Nash equilibria. The limited (logarithmic) size of the support provides a natural quasi-polynomial algorithm to compute epsilon-equilibria./nLipton and J. Naughton presented an adaptive random sampling algorithm for database querying[7][8] which is applicable to any query for which answers to the query can be partitioned into disjoint subsets[clarification needed]. Unlike most sampling estimation algorithms\u2014which statically determine the number of samples needed\u2014their algorithm decides the number of samples based on the sizes of the samples, and tends to keep the running time constant (as opposed to linear in the number of samples)./nDeMillo, Lipton and Perlis[9] criticized the idea of formal verification of programs and argued that/nChandra, Furst and Lipton[10] generalized the notion of two-party communication protocols to multi-party communication protocols. They proposed a model in which a collection of processes (\n\n\n\n\nP\n\n0\n\n\n,\n\nP\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\nP\n\nk\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P_{0},P_{1},\\ldots ,P_{k-1}}\n\n) have access to a set of integers (\n\n\n\n\na\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a_{0}}\n\n, \n\n\n\n\na\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\na\n\nk\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a_{1},\\ldots ,a_{k-1}}\n\n) except one of them, so that \n\n\n\n\nP\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P_{i}}\n\n is denied access to \n\n\n\n\na\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a_{i}}\n\n.  These processes are allowed to communicate in order to arrive at a consensus on a predicate. They studied this model's communication complexity, defined as the number of bits broadcast among all the processes. As an example, they studied the complexity of a k-party protocol for Exactly-N (do all \n\n\n\n\na\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a_{i}}\n\n\u2019s sum up to N?), and obtained a lower bound using the tiling method.

Mengoli wrote also a treatise on music theory, Speculazioni di musica [Speculations on music], much appreciated in his time and reviewed and partly translated by Henry Oldenburg in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.[4] Mengoli died in Bologna in 1685./nMengoli first posed the famous Basel problem in 1650, solved in 1735 by Leonhard Euler.[5] In 1650, he also proved that the sum of the alternating harmonic series is equal to the natural logarithm of 2./nHe also proved that the harmonic series has no upper bound, and provided a proof that Wallis' product for \n\n\n\n\u03c0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\pi }\n\n is correct.[6]/nMengoli anticipated the modern idea of limit of a sequence with his study of quasi-proportions in Geometriae speciosae elementa (1659). He used the term quasi-infinite for unbounded and quasi-null for vanishing./nMengoli became enthralled with a Diophantine problem posed by Jacques Ozanam called the six-square problem: find three integers such that their differences are squares and that the differences of their squares are also three squares. At first he thought that there was no solution, and in 1674 published his reasoning in Theorema Arthimeticum. But Ozanam then exhibited a solution: x = 2,288,168, y = 1,873,432, and z = 2,399,057. Humbled by his error, Mengoli made a study of Pythagorean triples to uncover the basis of this solution. He first solved an auxiliary Diophantine problem: find four numbers such that the sum of the first two is a square, the sum of the third and fourth is a square, their product is a square, and the ratio of the first two is greater than the ratio of the third to the fourth. He found two solutions: (112, 15, 35, 12) and (364, 27, 84, 13). Using these quadruples, and algebraic identities, he gave two solutions to the six-square problem beyond Ozanam\u2019s solutions. Jacques de Billy also provided six-square problem solutions.[8]/nPietro Mengoli's works were all published in Bologna:[7]", "96431": "Gerald Jay Sussman (born February 8, 1947) is the Panasonic Professor of Electrical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He has been involved in artificial intelligence (AI) research at MIT since 1964. His research has centered on understanding the problem-solving strategies used by scientists and engineers, with the goals of automating parts of the process and formalizing it to provide more effective methods of science and engineering education. Sussman has also worked in computer languages, in computer architecture, and in Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) design.[1]/nSussman attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an undergraduate and received his SB in mathematics in 1968. He continued his studies at MIT and obtained a PhD in 1973, also in mathematics, under the supervision of Seymour Papert. His doctoral thesis was titled \"A Computational Model of Skill Acquisition\" focusing on artificial intelligence and machine learning, using a computational performance model named HACKER.[2]/nAccording to a common story,[3] in 1966, Marvin Minsky tasked his student Gerald Jay Sussman to \u201cspend the summer linking a camera to a computer and getting the computer to describe what it saw.\u201d[4] This story was often told to illustrate that the difficulty of computer vision was not apparent to AI researchers in the early days./nSussman is a coauthor (with Hal Abelson and Julie Sussman) of the introductory computer science textbook Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. It was used at MIT for several decades, and has been translated into several languages.[citation needed]/nSussman's contributions to artificial intelligence include problem solving by debugging almost-right plans, propagation of constraints applied to electrical circuit analysis and synthesis, dependency-based explanation and dependency-based backtracking, and various language structures for expressing problem-solving strategies. Sussman and his former student, Guy L. Steele Jr., invented the programming language Scheme in 1975./nSussman saw that artificial intelligence ideas can be applied to computer-aided design (CAD). Sussman developed, with his graduate students, sophisticated computer-aided design tools for Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI). Steele made the first Scheme chips in 1978. These ideas and the AI-based CAD technology to support them were further developed in the Scheme chips of 1979 and 1981. The technique and experience developed were then used to design other special-purpose computers. Sussman was the principal designer of the Digital Orrery, a machine designed to do high-precision integrations for orbital mechanics experiments. The Orrery hardware was designed and built by a few people in a few months, using AI-based simulation and compiling tools.[5]/nUsing the Digital Orrery, Sussman has worked with Jack Wisdom to discover numerical evidence for chaotic motions in the outer planets. The Digital Orrery machine is now retired at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. Sussman was also the lead designer of the Supercomputer Toolkit, another multiprocessor computer optimized for evolving of ordinary differential equations. The Supercomputer Toolkit was used by Sussman and Wisdom to confirm and extend the discoveries made with the Digital Orrery to include the entire planetary system.[6][7]/nSussman has pioneered the use of computational descriptions to communicate methodological ideas in teaching subjects in Electrical Circuits and in Signals and Systems. Over the past decade Sussman and Wisdom have developed a subject that uses computational techniques to communicate a deeper understanding of advanced classical mechanics. In Computer Science: Reflections on the Field, Reflections from the Field, he writes \"... computational algorithms are used to express the methods used in the analysis of dynamical phenomena. Expressing the methods in a computer language forces them to be unambiguous and computationally effective. Students are expected to read the programs and to extend them and to write new ones. The task of formulating a method as a computer-executable program and debugging that program is a powerful exercise in the learning process. Also, once formalized procedurally, a mathematical idea becomes a tool that can be used directly to compute results.\" Sussman and Wisdom, with Meinhard Mayer, have produced a textbook, Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics, to capture these new ideas./nSussman and Abelson have also been a part of the free software movement, including releasing MIT/GNU Scheme as free software[8] and serving on the board of directors of the Free Software Foundation.[9]/nSussman's work is presented in many videos, such as: with Hal Abelson in a full 20 lecture version of MIT's SICP course,[10] for LispNYC,[11][12] at the International Conference on Complex Systems,[13] for ArsDigita University,[14] and giving the keynote talk at a Strange Loop conference.[15][16]/nFor his contributions to computer science education, Sussman received the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Karl Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award in 1990, and the Amar G.

In 1876 he obtained the professorship in Descriptive Geometry at Complutense University, where he remained until his retirement due to terminal illness in 1916./nDuring his tenure he promoted research in synthetic geometry, influencing a generation of Spanish mathematicians, including Miguel Vegas, Cecilio Jim\u00e9nez Rueda, Jos\u00e9 \u00c1lvarez Ude, Antonio Torroja, and Julio Rey Pastor. His books became highly regarded textbooks, expanding the scope of his influence and that of his inspiration, Karl von Staudt./nAt that time Complutense University was the only University in the Spanish Empire entitled to grant Doctor degrees, so that most Spanish mathematicians can trace their academic genealogy to Dr. Torroja Caball\u00e9.\nIn the year 1900, Torroja and his disciple Miguel Vegas, prepared the Curriculum for the studies of Sciences, which had an overwhelming focus on Descriptive and Analytic Geometry./nIn the year 1891, Torroja was elected member of the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences, where he was formally inducted in the year 1893 after offering his speech \"Rese\u00f1a de los medios empleados por la geometr\u00eda pura actual para alcanzar el grado de generalidad y de simplificaci\u00f3n que la distingue de la antigua\". This speech argued that the work of Karl Georg Christian von Staudt is the unifying contribution to Geometry. In 1911 he became a founding member of the Spanish Mathematical Society, where he was vice president, with Echegaray and Garc\u00eda de Galdeano.", "23754958": "Lucio Lombardo-Radice (Catania, 10 July 1916; Brussels, 21 November 1982) was an Italian mathematician.

He recorded pithy and humorous songs that became popular in the 1950s and 1960s. His songs often parodied popular musical forms, though they usually had original melodies. An exception is \"The Elements\", in which he set the names of the chemical elements to the tune of the \"Major-General's Song\" from Gilbert and Sullivan's Pirates of Penzance./nLehrer's early performances dealt with non-topical subjects and black humor in songs such as \"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park\". In the 1960s, he produced songs about timely social and political issues, particularly for the U.S. version of the television show That Was the Week That Was. The popularity of these songs has far outlasted their topical subjects and references. Lehrer quoted a friend's explanation: \"Always predict the worst and you'll be hailed as a prophet.\"[1] In the early 1970s, Lehrer largely retired from public performance to devote his time to teaching mathematics and musical theater history at the University of California, Santa Cruz./nThomas Andrew Lehrer was born on April 9, 1928, to a secular Jewish family and grew up on Manhattan's Upper East Side.[2][3] He is the son of Morris James Lehrer and Anna Lehrer (n\u00e9e Waller).[4][5] He began studying classical piano at the age of seven, but was more interested in the popular music of the age. Eventually, his mother also sent him to a popular-music piano teacher.[6] At this early age, he began writing show tunes, which eventually helped him as a satirical composer and writer in his years of lecturing at Harvard University and later at other universities.[7]/nLehrer attended the Horace Mann School in Riverdale, New York, part of the Bronx.[2][8] He also attended Camp Androscoggin, both as a camper and a counselor.[9] Lehrer was considered a child prodigy and entered Harvard College, where one of his professors was Irving Kaplansky,[10][11] at the age of 15 after graduating from Loomis School.[2] As a mathematics undergraduate student at Harvard College, he began to write comic songs to entertain his friends, including \"Fight Fiercely, Harvard\" (1945). Those songs were later named collectively The Physical Revue,[12] a joking reference to a leading scientific journal, the Physical Review./nLehrer graduated Bachelor of Arts in mathematics from Harvard University, magna cum laude,[13] in 1946.[14] At Harvard, he was the roommate of the Canadian theologian Robert Crouse.[15] He received his AM degree the next year and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa.[16]  He later taught mathematics and other classes at MIT, Harvard, Wellesley, and the University of California, Santa Cruz.[17]\nLehrer remained in Harvard's doctoral program for several years, taking time out for his musical career and to work as a researcher at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory.[18]/nLehrer was drafted into the U.S. Army from 1955 to 1957, working at the National Security Agency (NSA). Lehrer has stated that he invented the Jello shot during this time, as a means of circumventing a naval base's ban on alcoholic beverages.[18] \nDespite holding a master's degree in an era when American conscripts often lacked a high school diploma, Lehrer served as an enlisted soldier, achieving the rank of Specialist Third Class, which he described as being a \"corporal without portfolio\".[19] These experiences became fodder for songs, such as \"The Wild West is Where I Want to Be\" and \"It Makes a Fellow Proud to Be a Soldier\".[20] In 2020 Lehrer publicly revealed that he had been assigned to the NSA; since the mere fact of the NSA's existence was classified at the time, Lehrer found himself in the position of implicitly using nuclear weapons work as a cover story for something more sensitive.[21]/nIn 1960, Lehrer returned to full-time math studies at Harvard.[8] From 1962, he taught in the political science department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[22] In 1965 he gave up on his mathematics dissertation on modes in statistics, after working on it intermittently for 15 years.[2]/nIn 1972, Lehrer joined the faculty of the University of California, Santa Cruz, teaching an introductory course entitled The Nature of Mathematics to liberal arts majors\u2014\"math for tenors\", according to Lehrer. He also taught a class in musical theater. He occasionally performed songs in his lectures.[11]/nIn 2001, Lehrer taught his last mathematics class, on the topic of infinity, and retired from academia.[23] He has remained in the area, and in 2003 said he still \"hangs out\" around the University of California, Santa Cruz.[24]/nLehrer was mainly influenced by musical theater. According to Gerald Nachman's book Seriously Funny,[25] the Broadway musical Let's Face It!  made an early and lasting impression on him. Lehrer's style consists of parodying various forms of popular song. For example, his appreciation of list songs led him to write \"The Elements\", which lists the chemical elements to the tune of Gilbert and Sullivan's \"Major-General's Song\".[26]/nIn author and Boston University professor Isaac Asimov's second autobiographical volume, In Joy Still Felt, Asimov recounted seeing Lehrer perform in a Boston nightclub on October 9, 1954. Lehrer sang a song about Jim getting it from Louise, and Sally from Jim, \"...and after a while you gathered the 'it' was venereal disease. Suddenly, as the combinations grew more grotesque, you realized he was satirizing every known perversion without using a single naughty phrase. It was clearly unsingable outside a nightclub.\" [The song was likely \"I Got It From Agnes\".] Asimov also recalled a song that dealt with the Boston subway system, making use of the stations leading into town from Harvard, observing that the local subject-matter rendered the song useless for general distribution. Lehrer subsequently granted Asimov permission to print the lyrics to the subway song in his book. \"I haven't gone to nightclubs often,\" said Asimov, \"but of all the times I have gone, it was on this occasion that I had by far the best time.\"[27]/nLehrer was encouraged by the success of his performances, so he paid $15 (equivalent to $164 in 2022) for some studio time in 1953 to record Songs by Tom Lehrer. The initial pressing was 400 copies. Radio stations would not air his songs because of his controversial subjects, so he sold the album on campus at Harvard for $3,  equivalent to $33 in 2022, while \"several stores near the Harvard campus sold it for $3.50, taking only a minimal markup as a kind of community service. Newsstands on campus sold it for the same price.\"[28] After one summer, he started to receive mail orders from all parts of the country, as far away as San Francisco, after the San Francisco Chronicle wrote an article on the record.[29] Interest in his recordings spread by word of mouth. People played their records for friends, who then also wanted a copy.[30]  Lehrer recalled, \"Lacking exposure in the media, my songs spread slowly. Like herpes, rather than ebola.\"[31]/nThe album included the macabre \"I Hold Your Hand in Mine\", the mildly risqu\u00e9 \"Be Prepared\", and \"Lobachevsky\" regarding plagiarizing mathematicians. It became a cult success by word of mouth, despite being self-published and without promotion. The limited distribution of the album led to a knock off album by Jack \"Enjal\" (a pseudonym of Jack Nagel) being released in 1958 without Lehrer's approval, where some of the lyrics were mistranscribed.[32]/nLehrer embarked on a series of concert tours and recorded a second album in 1959. He released the second album in two versions: the songs were the same, but More of Tom Lehrer was a studio recording and An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer was recorded live in concert.  In 2013, Lehrer recalled the studio session for \"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park\", which referred to the practice of controlling pigeons in Boston with strychnine-treated corn:[33]/nThe copyist arrived at the last minute with the parts and passed them out to the band... And there was no title on it, and there was no lyrics.  And so they ran through it, \"What a pleasant little waltz\".... And the engineer said, \"'Poisoning Pigeons in the Park,' take one,\" and the piano player said, \"What?\" and literally fell off the stool.[34]/nLehrer had a breakthrough in the United Kingdom on December 4, 1957, when the University of London awarded a doctor of music degree honoris causa to Princess Margaret, and the public orator, Professor J. R. Sutherland, said it was \"in the full knowledge that the Princess is a connoisseur of music and a performer of skill and distinction, her taste being catholic, ranging from Mozart to the calypso and from opera to the songs of Miss Beatrice Lillie and Tom Lehrer.\"[35][36][37] This prompted significant interest in Lehrer's works and helped to secure distribution in Britain for his five-year-old debut album. It was there that his music achieved real sales popularity, as a result of the proliferation of university newspapers referring to the material, and inadvertently due to the BBC, which in 1958 banned from broadcast 10 of the 12 songs on the album.[38] By the end of the 1950s, Lehrer had sold 370,000 records.[2]/nIn 1960, Lehrer essentially retired from touring in the U.S.[2] The same year, he toured Australia and New Zealand, performing a total of 33 concerts to great acclaim[28] and controversy.[39] While in New Zealand, he penned lyrics critical of the All Blacks' upcoming tour of Apartheid-era South Africa and Prime Minister Walter Nash's stance on it.[40][41] Lehrer's tours occurred during a time in which he was, he said, \"banned, censored, mentioned in several houses of parliament and threatened with arrest\". In particular, \"Be Prepared\" drew advance resistance in Brisbane from the commissioner of police. He performed several songs in Australia that were still unreleased, including \"The Masochism Tango\".[24] In the early 1960s, he was employed as the resident songwriter for the U.S. edition of That Was The Week That Was (TW3), a satirical television show.[28]/n/nA greater proportion of his output became overtly political, or at least topical, on subjects such as education (\"New Math\"), the Second Vatican Council (\"The Vatican Rag\"), race relations (\"National Brotherhood Week\"), air and water pollution (\"Pollution\"), American militarism (\"Send the Marines\"),  and nuclear proliferation (\"Who's Next?\" and \"MLF Lullaby\"). He also wrote a song satirizing rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, who worked for Nazi Germany before working for the United States. Lehrer did not appear on the television show; vocalist Nancy Ames performed his songs (to Lehrer's chagrin),[32] and lines were often cut from his songs.[32] Lehrer later recorded nine of these songs on the album That Was The Year That Was (1965) recorded at the Hungry I nightclub in San Francisco.[42]/nIn 1966, BBC TV host David Frost returned to the UK with the BBC program The Frost Report; alongside Julie Felix, Lehrer provided musical satire on the weekly subject.[43] The show was transmitted live, and he pre-recorded all his segments at one performance.[42] Lehrer was not featured in every edition, but his songs featured in an appropriate part of each show.[44] At least two of his songs were not included on any of his LPs: a reworking of No\u00ebl Coward's \"That is the End of the News\" (with some new lyrics)[45] and a comic explanation of how Britain might adapt to the coming of decimal currency.[46] The record deal with Reprise Records for That Was The Year That Was also gave Reprise distribution rights for his earlier recordings, as Lehrer wanted to wind up his own record imprint.[32] The Reprise issue of Songs by Tom Lehrer was a stereo re-recording. This version was not issued on CD, as Lehrer was unhappy with this version.[42] The live recording included bonus tracks \"L-Y\" and \"Silent E\", two of the ten songs that he wrote for the PBS children's educational series The Electric Company. Lehrer later commented that worldwide sales of the recordings under Reprise surpassed 1.8 million units in 1996. That same year, That Was The Year That Was went gold.[30]  The album liner notes promote his songs with self-deprecating humor, such as quoting a New York Times review from 1959: Mr. Lehrer's muse is \"not fettered by such inhibiting factors as taste\".[47]/nLehrer toured Sweden, Norway and Denmark in 1967,[48] his concert in Oslo was recorded for Danish television and subsequently released on DVD some 40 years later.[49] He performed as a prominent international guest at the Studenterforeningen (student association) in Copenhagen, which was televised, and he commented on stage that he might be America's \"revenge for Victor Borge\".[50] He performed original songs in a Dodge automobile industrial film distributed primarily to automobile dealers and shown at promotional events in 1967, set in a fictional American wild west town and titled The Dodge Rebellion Theatre presents Ballads For '67.[28][51] He attempted to adapt Sweeney Todd as a Broadway musical, working with Joe Raposo, to star Jerry Colonna. They started a few songs but, as Lehrer noted, \"Nothing ever came of it, and of course twenty years later Stephen Sondheim beat me to the punch.\"[52]/nIn the 1970s, Lehrer concentrated on teaching mathematics and musical theater, although he also wrote ten songs for the educational children's television show The Electric Company. His last public performance for many years took place in 1972, on a fundraising tour for Democratic US presidential candidate George McGovern.[2]/nWhen asked about his reasons for abandoning his musical career in an interview in the book accompanying his CD boxed set, released in 2000, Lehrer cited a lack of interest, a disdain of touring, and the monotony of performing the same songs repeatedly.  He observed that when he was moved to write and perform songs, he did and, when he was not, he did not, and that after a while he simply lost interest. Even though Lehrer was \"a hero of the anti-nuclear, civil rights left\" and covered its political issues in many of his songs and, even though he shared the New Left's opposition to the Vietnam War, and advocated for civil rights, he disliked the aesthetics of the counterculture of the 1960s and stopped performing as the movement gained momentum.[2]/nLehrer's musical career was relatively brief.  He once mentioned that he performed a mere 109 shows and wrote 37 songs over 20 years.[53]  Nevertheless, he developed a significant following in the United States and abroad./nLehrer's music became a staple of the Doctor Demento Show when it began national syndication in 1977.[54]\nIn 1980, Cameron Mackintosh produced Tomfoolery, a revue of Lehrer's songs that was a hit on the London stage. Lehrer was not initially involved with the show, but he was pleased with it; he eventually gave the stage production his full support and updated several of his lyrics for the show. Tomfoolery contained 27 songs and led to more than 200 productions,[30] including an Off-Broadway production at the Village Gate which ran for 120 performances in 1981.[55] Lehrer made a rare TV appearance on BBC's Parkinson show in conjunction with the Tomfoolery premiere in 1980 at the Criterion Theatre in London, where he sang \"I Got It from Agnes\".[56][57] There were \"Tomfoolery\" performances in San Francisco about 1982 and in 2018\u201319. In 1993, he wrote \"That's Mathematics\" for the closing credits to a Mathematical Sciences Research Institute video[58] celebrating the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem./nOn June 7 and 8, 1998, Lehrer performed in public for the first time in 25 years at the Lyceum Theatre, London as part of the show Hey, Mr. Producer! celebrating the career of Cameron Mackintosh, who had produced Tomfoolery. The June 8 show was his only performance before Queen Elizabeth II. Lehrer sang \"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park\" and an updated version of the nuclear proliferation song \"Who's Next?\".[59]/nIn 2000, Lehrer commented that he doubted his songs had any real effect on those not already critical of the establishment: \"I don't think this kind of thing has an impact on the unconverted, frankly. It's not even preaching to the converted; it's titillating the converted\u00a0... I'm fond of quoting Peter Cook, who talked about the satirical Berlin Kabaretts of the 1930s, which did so much to stop the rise of Hitler and prevent the Second World War.\"[60]/nLehrer has said, jokingly, of his musical career: \"If, after hearing my songs, just one human being is inspired to say something nasty to a friend, or perhaps to strike a loved one, it will all have been worth the while.\"[6]\nIn 2003, Lehrer commented that his particular brand of political satire is more difficult in the modern world: \"The real issues I don't think most people touch. The Clinton jokes are all about Monica Lewinsky and all that stuff and not about the important things, like the fact that he wouldn't ban land mines\u00a0... I'm not tempted to write a song about George W. Bush. I couldn't figure out what sort of song I would write. That's the problem: I don't want to satirize George Bush and his puppeteers, I want to vaporize them.\"[24]/nIn 2000, the boxed CD set The Remains of Tom Lehrer was released by Rhino Entertainment. It included live and studio versions of his first two albums, That Was The Year That Was, the songs that he wrote for The Electric Company, and some previously unreleased material, a small hardbound lyrics book with an introduction by Dr. Demento. In 2010, Shout! Factory launched a reissue campaign, making Lehrer's out-of-print albums available digitally. The CD/DVD combo The Tom Lehrer Collection was also issued, including his best-known songs, with a DVD featuring an Oslo concert.[61]/nIn a February 2008 phone call, Gene Weingarten of The Washington Post interviewed Lehrer off the record.

She graduated in early 1932 and then entered the University of Berlin.  The lecture courses in mathematics that she took in her first year were: Introduction to Higher Mathematics given by Georg Feigl; Analytical Geometry and Projective Geometry both given by Ludwig Bieberbach, Differential and Integral Calculus given by Erhard Schmidt, and the Theory of Numbers given by Friedrich Schur.  She also took formal courses in physics, and attended lectures in psychology, literature and law.\nAs a result of her first year work, Hanna was awarded three-quarters' remission of fees and a position as a part-time assistant in the Mathematical Institute's library.[3][1]/nA friendship between Hanna and Bernhard Neumann began in January 1933.  In March 1933, the Nazis came to power and in August 1933, Bernhard, who was Jewish, moved to Cambridge, England.  She visited Bernhard in London at Easter 1934 and they became secretly engaged.  After this she returned to Germany to continue her studies.[3]/nIn her second year Neumann was part of a group of students who tried to prevent Nazi disruption of Jewish academics' lectures by ensuring that only genuine students attended.  She lost her job in the Mathematical Institute, presumably as a result of such activities. However she had by then been awarded, and continued to earn for the rest of her course, full remission of fees.[3]/nIn the remainder of her undergraduate degree, she studied mathematics, physics and philosophy.

This book, which addressed the question, \"What is the universe made of?\", systematically created a framework of stability and genericity for k-plane gravitational lensing.[14] The book drew upon powerful tools from the theory of singularities and put the subject of weak-deflection k-plane gravitational lensing on a rigorous and unified mathematical foundation.[14]/nFollowing his 1991\u20132001 body of mathematical lensing work, Petters turned to more astrophysical lensing issues from 2002 to 2005. In collaboration with astronomers, he applied some of the mathematical theory in [AP13] to help develop a practical diagnostic test for the presence of dark substructures in galaxies lensing quasars;[15][16] classify the local astrometric (centroid) and photometric curves of an extended source when it crosses fold and cusp caustics due to generic lenses;[17][18] predict the quantitative astrometric curve's shape produced by Galactic binary lenses.[17][18]  The classified local properties of the astrometric curves revealed a characteristic S-shape for fold crossings, parabolic and swallowtail features for cusp crossings, and a jump discontinuity for crossings over the fold arcs merging into a cusp. Petters, Levine, and Wambgamnns also developed a formula to calculate the size of the jump./nDuring the period from 2005 to 2007, Petters collaborated with astronomers and physicists to explore gravitational lensing in directions beyond its traditional confines in astronomy. In a series of three mathematical physics papers published written with the astronomer Charles R. Keeton, he utilized higher-order gravitational lensing effects by compact bodies to test different theories of gravity with the general theory of relativity of Einstein among them. These papers computed beyond the standard weak-deflection limit the first- and second-order corrections to the image positions, magnifications, and time delays due to lensing in general relativity and alternative gravitational theories describable within the PPN formalism,[19] and even determined lensing invariants for the PPN family of models.[20] Their findings were applied to the Galactic black hole, binary pulsars, and gravitational microlensing scenarios to make testable predictions about lensed images and their time delays.[19] Another paper took on the difficult issue of how to test hyperspace models like braneworld gravity that postulate an extra dimension to physical space. The paper developed a semi-classical wave theory of braneworld black hole lensing and used that theory along with braneworld cosmology to predict a testable signature of microscopic braneworld black holes on gamma-ray light.[21][22] Additionally, in a 2007 paper, Petters and M.C. Werner found a system of equations that can be applied to test the Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis observationally using the realistic case of lensing by a Kerr black hole.[23][24]/nPetters's previous work (1991\u20132007) dealt with non-random gravitational lensing. Starting in 2008, his research program focused on developing a mathematical theory of random (stochastic) gravitational lensing. In two papers, Petters, Rider, and Teguia took first steps in creating a mathematical theory of stochastic gravitational microlensing. They characterized to several asymptotic orders the probability densities of random time delay functions, lensing maps, and shear maps in stochastic microlensing and determined a Kac-Rice type formula for the global expected number of images due to a general stochastic lens system.[25][26] The work forms a concrete framework from which extensions to more general random maps can be made.\nIn two additional papers, he and Aazami found geometric universal magnification invariants of higher-order caustics occurring in lensing and caustics produced by generic general maps up to codimension five.[27][28][29] The invariants hold with a probability of 1 for random lenses and thereby form important consistency checks for research on random image magnifications of sources near stable caustics./nPetters has served as director of the Reginaldo Howard Memorial Scholarship program at Duke University.[30] He has also been active in the African-American community particularly through his mentoring, recruiting, and lecturing.[31][32] He has received several community service awards for his social outreach.[33][34] Petters is the first tenured African-American professor in mathematics at Duke University.[33] He is very involved in the Belizean community and founded the Petters Research Institute[35] in 2005 to help train Belizean young people in STEM fields and foster STEM entrepreneurship.[36][37] He has written five books, three of them science and mathematics problem-solving books for Belizean students.[38][39]  Some of his entrepreneurial work was conducted while he was a professor of business administration at Duke's Fuqua School of Business (2008\u20132017).[4]  Petters also served the Government of Belize as chairman of the Council of Science Advisers to the prime minister of Belize (2010\u20132013).[40][4]/nPetters has received numerous awards and honors.[41]  He was won an Alfred P.

Ki\u0153s at the \u00c9cole d'Architecture and the \u00c9cole des Mines, teaching Uwe Jannsen at the same schools, and studying under Charles-Adolphe Wurtz at the \u00c9cole des Beaux Arts and the \u00c9cole de M\u00e9decine.[1] Lemoine also lectured at various scientific institutions in Paris and taught as a private tutor for a period before accepting an appointment as a professor at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique.[5]/nIn 1870, a laryngeal disease forced him to discontinue his teaching. He took a brief vacation in Grenoble and, when he returned to Paris, he published some of his remaining mathematical research. He also participated and founded several scientific societies and journals, such as the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Math\u00e9matique de France, the Journal de Physique, and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Physique, all in 1871.[1]/nAs a founding member of the Association Fran\u00e7aise pour l'Avancement des Sciences, Lemoine presented what became his best-known paper, Note sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s du centre des m\u00e9dianes antiparall\u00e8les dans un triangle at the Association's 1874 meeting in Lille. The central focus of this paper concerned the point which bears his name today.[6] Most of the other results discussed in the paper pertained to various concyclic points that could be constructed from the Lemoine point.[2]/nLemoine served in the French military for a time in the years following the publishing of his best-known papers. Discharged during the Commune, he afterwards became a civil engineer in Paris.[1] In this career, he rose to the rank of chief inspector, a position he held until 1896. As the chief inspector, he was responsible for the gas supply of the city.[7]/nDuring his tenure as a civil engineer, Lemoine wrote a treatise concerning compass and straightedge constructions entitled, La G\u00e9om\u00e9trographie ou l'art des constructions g\u00e9om\u00e9triques, which he considered his greatest work, despite the fact that it was not well-received critically. The original title was De la mesure de la simplicit\u00e9 dans les sciences math\u00e9matiques, and the original idea for the text would have discussed the concepts Lemoine devised as concerning the entirety of mathematics. Time constraints, however, limited the scope of the paper.[1] Instead of the original idea, Lemoine proposed a simplification of the construction process to a number of basic operations with the compass and straightedge.[8] He presented this paper at a meeting of the Association Fran\u00e7aise in Oran, Algeria in 1888. The paper, however, did not garner much enthusiasm or interest among the mathematicians gathered there.[9] Lemoine published several other papers on his construction system that same year, including Sur la mesure de la simplicit\u00e9 dans les constructions g\u00e9om\u00e9triques in the Comptes rendus of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise. He published additional papers on the subject in Mathesis (1888), Journal des math\u00e9matiques \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires (1889), Nouvelles annales de math\u00e9matiques (1892), and the self-published La G\u00e9om\u00e9trographie ou l'art des constructions g\u00e9om\u00e9triques, which was presented at the meeting of the Association Fran\u00e7aise in Pau (1892), and again at Besan\u00e7on (1893) and Caen (1894).[1]/nAfter this, Lemoine published another series of papers, including a series on what he called transformation continue (continuous transformation), which related mathematical equations to geometrical objects. This meaning stood separately from the modern definition of transformation. His papers on this subject included, Sur les transformations syst\u00e9matiques des formules relatives au triangle (1891), \u00c9tude sur une nouvelle transformation continue (1891), Une r\u00e8gle d'analogies dans le triangle et la sp\u00e9cification de certaines analogies \u00e0 une transformation dite transformation continue (1893), and Applications au t\u00e9tra\u00e8dre de la transformation continue (1894).[1]/nIn 1894, Lemoine co-founded another mathematical journal entitled, L'interm\u00e9diaire des math\u00e9maticiens along with Charles Laisant, a friend whom he met at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. Lemoine had been planning such a journal since early 1893, but thought that he would be too busy to create it. At a dinner with Laisant in March 1893, he suggested the idea of the journal. Laisant cajoled him to create the journal, and so they approached the publisher Gauthier-Villars, which published the first issue in January 1894. Lemoine served as the journal's first editor, and held the position for several years. The year after the journal's initial publication, he retired from mathematical research, but continued to support the subject.[6] Lemoine died on 21 February 1912 in his home city of Paris.[2]/nLemoine's work has been said to contribute towards laying the foundation of modern triangle geometry.[10] The American Mathematical Monthly, in which much of Lemoine's work is published, declared that \"To none of these [geometers] more than \u00c9mile-Michel-Hyacinthe Lemoine is due the honor of starting this movement [of modern triangle geometry]\u00a0...\"[1] At the annual meeting of the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1902, Lemoine received the 1,000-franc Franc\u0153ur prize,[11] which he held for several years.[12][13]/nIn his 1874 paper, entitled Note sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s du centre des m\u00e9dianes antiparall\u00e8les dans un triangle, Lemoine proved the concurrency of the symmedians of a triangle; the reflections of the medians of the triangle over the angle bisectors. Other results in the paper included the idea that the symmedian from a vertex of the triangle divides the opposite side into segments whose ratio is equal to the ratio of the squares of the other two sides./nLemoine also proved that if lines are drawn through the Lemoine point parallel to the sides of the triangle, then the six points of intersection of the lines and the sides of the triangle are concyclic, or that they lie on a circle.[14] This circle is now known as the first Lemoine circle, or simply the Lemoine circle.[2][15]/nLemoine's system of constructions, the G\u00e9om\u00e9trographie, attempted to create a methodological system by which constructions could be judged. This system enabled a more direct process for simplifying existing constructions. In his description, he listed five main operations: placing a compass's end on a given point, placing it on a given line, drawing a circle with the compass placed upon the aforementioned point or line, placing a straightedge on a given line, and extending the line with the straightedge.[14][16]/nThe \"simplicity\" of a construction could be measured by the number of its operations. In his paper, he discussed as an example the Apollonius problem originally posed by Apollonius of Perga during the Hellenistic period; the method of constructing a circle tangent to three given circles. The problem had already been solved by Joseph Diaz Gergonne in 1816 with a construction of simplicity 400, but Lemoine's presented solution had simplicity 154.[2][17] Simpler solutions such as those by Frederick Soddy in 1936 and by David Eppstein in 2001 are now known to exist.[18]/nIn 1894, Lemoine stated what is now known as Lemoine's conjecture: Every odd number which is greater than three can be expressed in the form 2p + q where p and q are prime.[19] In 1985, John Kiltinen and Peter Young conjectured an extension of the conjecture which they called the \"refined Lemoine conjecture\". They published the conjecture in a journal of the Mathematical Association of America:  \"For any odd number m which is at least 9, there are odd prime numbers p, q, r and s and positive integers j and k such that m = 2p + q, 2 + pq = 2j + r and 2q + p = 2k + s.\u00a0[...] the study has directed our attention to more subtle aspects of the additive theory of prime numbers. Our conjecture reflects this, dealing with interactions of sums involving primes whereas Goldbach's conjecture and Lemoine's conjecture deal with such sums only individually. This conjecture and the open questions about numbers at levels two and three are of interest in their own right because of the issues they raise within this fascinating and often baffling additive realm of the prime numbers.\"[20]/nLemoine has been described by Nathan Altshiller Court as a co-founder (along with Henri Brocard and Joseph Neuberg) of modern triangle geometry, a term used by William Gallatly, among others.[14] In this context, \"modern\" is used to refer to geometry developed from the late 18th century onward.[21] Such geometry relies on the abstraction of figures in the plane rather than analytic methods used earlier involving specific angle measures and distances. The geometry focuses on topics such as collinearity, concurrency, and concyclicity, as they do not involve the measures listed previously.[22]/nLemoine's work defined many of the noted traits of this movement. His G\u00e9om\u00e9trographie and relation of equations to tetrahedrons and triangles, as well as his study of concurrencies and concyclities, contributed to the modern triangle geometry of the time. The definition of points of the triangle such as the Lemoine point was also a staple of the geometry, and other modern triangle geometers such as Brocard and Gaston Tarry wrote about similar points.[21]", "13793648": "Alexey Grigoryevich Ivakhnenko (Ukrainian: \u041e\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u00ed\u0439 \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0301\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0406\u0432\u0430\u0301\u0445\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e; 30 March 1913 \u2013 16 October 2007) was a Soviet and Ukrainian mathematician most famous for developing the group method of data handling (GMDH), a method of inductive statistical learning, for which he is sometimes referred to as the \"Father of deep learning\".[1]/nAleksey was born in Kobelyaky, Poltava Governorate in a family of teachers.[2] In 1932 he graduated from Electrotechnical college in Kiev and worked for two years as an engineer on the construction of large power plant in Berezniki. Then in 1938, after graduation from the Leningrad Electrotechnical Institute, Ivakhnenko worked in the All-Union Electrotechnical Institute in Moscow during wartime. There he investigated the problems of automatic control in the laboratory, led by Sergey Lebedev./nHe continued research in other institutions in Ukraine after return to Kiev in 1944. In that year he received the Ph.D. degree and later, in 1954 had received D.Sc. degree. In 1964, he was appointed as a Head of the Department of Combined Control Systems at the Institute of Cybernetics. Simultaneously working at first as a Lecturer, and from 1961, as a Professor of Automatic Control and Technical Cybernetics at the Kiev Polytechnic Institute./nIvakhnenko is known to be the founder of Inductive modelling, a scientific approach used for pattern recognition and complex systems forecasting.[3] He had used this approach during development of the group method of data handling (GMDH). In 1968 the journal \"Avtomatika\" had published his article \"Group Method of Data Handling \u2013 a rival of the method of stochastic approximation\",[4] marking the beginning of a new stage in his scientific work. He led the development of this approach, with a professional team of mathematicians and engineers at the Institute of Cybernetics./nThe GMDH method presents a unique approach to the artificial intelligence problems solution and even a new philosophy to scientific research, which became possible using modern computers.[3] A researcher may not adhere \nprecisely to traditional deductive way of building models \"from general theory \u2013 to a particular model\":  monitoring an object, studying its structure, understanding the principles of its operation, developing theory and testing the model of an object. Instead, the new approach is proposed \"from specified data \u2013 to a general model\": after the input of data, a researcher selects a class of models, the type of models-variants generation and sets the criterion for model selection. As most routine work is transferred to a computer, the impact of human influence on the objective result is minimised. In fact, this approach can be considered as one of the implementations of the artificial intelligence thesis, which states that a computer can act as powerful advisor to humans./nThe development of GMDH consists of a synthesis of ideas from different areas of science: the cybernetic concept of \"black box\" and the principle of successive genetic selection of pairwise features, Godel's incompleteness theorems and the Gabor's principle of \"freedom of decisions choice\",[5] the Adh\u00e9mar's incorrectness and the Beer's principle of external additions.[6]/nGMDH is the original method for solving problems for structural-parametric identification of models for experimental data under uncertainty.[7] Such a problem occurs in the construction of a mathematical model that approximates the unknown pattern of investigated object or process.[8] It uses information about it that is implicitly contained in data. GMDH differs from other methods of modelling by the active application of the following principles: automatic models generation, inconclusive decisions, and consistent selection by external criteria for finding models of optimal complexity. It had an original multilayered procedure for automatic models structure generation, which imitates the evolutionary process of biological selection with consideration of pairwise successive features. Such procedure is currently used in deep learning networks.[9] To compare and choose optimal models, two or more subsets of a data sample are used. This makes it possible to avoid preliminary assumptions, because sample division implicitly acknowledges different types of uncertainty during the automatic construction of the optimal model./nIn the early 1980s Ivakhnenko had established an organic analogy between the problem of constructing models for noisy data and signal passing through the channel with noise.[10] This made possible to lay the foundations of the theory of noise-immune modelling.[7] The main result of this theory is that the complexity of optimal predictive model depends on the level of uncertainty in the data: the higher this level (e.g. due to noise) - the simpler must be the optimal model (with less estimated parameters). This initiated the development of the GMDH theory as an inductive method of automatic adaptation of optimal model complexity to the level of information in fuzzy data. Therefore, GMDH is often considered to be the original information technology for knowledge extraction from experimental data./nAlongside to GMDH, Ivakhnenko had developed the following set of results:/nIvakhnenko is well known for his achievements in the theory of invariance and theory of combined automatic control systems, that operates on the principle of measured disturbances compensation. He had developed devices and methods for the adaptive control of systems with magnetic amplifiers and motors./nHe is the author of the first Soviet monograph on engineering cybernetics,[14] which was published worldwide in seven languages.[18] In his study, a further development of the principles of combined control was connected with the implementation of methods of evolutionary self-organisation, pattern recognition and forecasting in control systems./nIn recent years, his main innovation - the GMDH method was developed as a method of inductive modelling, complex processes and systems forecasting. His ideas are utilised now in the deep learning networks.[19] The effectiveness of the method was confirmed repeatedly during the solution of real complex problems in ecology, meteorology, economics and technology, which aided increase its popularity among the international scientific community.[20] In parallel, there were conducted developments of evolutionary self-organising algorithms in a related field - clustering problems of pattern recognition.[21] Advances in the modelling of environmental processes reflected in the monographs,[22][10] economic processes - in the books. [17]\n[23] The results of exploration of recurrent multilayered GMDH algorithms are described in the books.[16][3]/nFrom 1963 to 1989 Ivakhnenko was the editor of the specialized scientific journal \"Avtomatika\" (later \"Problems of management and computer science\"), that played a crucial role in the formation and development of the Ukrainian school of Inductive modelling. Throughout these years the magazine was translated and reprinted in the United States as \"Soviet Automatic Control\" (later \"Journal of Automation and Information Sciences\")./nAlongside constant innovation in his field since 1945, Ivakhnenko maintained an active teaching career, at first as the Assistant Professor at the Department of Theoretical Mechanics, and then at the Control Systems faculty. Since 1960 as Professor of the Department of Technical Cybernetics in Kyiv Polytechnic Institute, he contributed lectures to the University and student body, as well as oversaw the work of many graduate students. In 1958-1964 he was an organiser of the All-Union Conferences of Invariance in Kiev, where the development of the invariant control systems theory was restored after prohibition.[24]/nHis inexhaustible enthusiasm helped more than 220 young scientists to prepare and successfully defend their Ph.D. dissertations under his leadership in the KPI and the Institute of Cybernetics and nearly 30 of his students defended their post-doctoral dissertations.

Furthermore, his students V.M.Kuntsevych, V.I.Kostyuk, V.I.Ivanenko, V.I.Vasiliev, A.A.Pavlov and others had created their own respected scientific schools.

His methods were used later by Ferdinand von Lindemann to prove that \u03c0 is transcendental./nHermite was born in Dieuze, Moselle, on 24 December 1822,[1] with a deformity in his right foot that would impair his gait throughout his life. He was the sixth of seven children of Ferdinand Hermite and his wife, Madeleine n\u00e9e Lallemand. Ferdinand worked in the drapery business of Madeleine's family while also pursuing a career as an artist. The drapery business relocated to Nancy in 1828, and so did the family.[2]/nHermite obtained his secondary education at Coll\u00e8ge de Nancy and then, in Paris, at Coll\u00e8ge Henri IV and at the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand.[1] He read some of Joseph-Louis Lagrange's writings on the solution of numerical equations and Carl Friedrich Gauss's publications on number theory./nHermite wanted to take his higher education at \u00c9cole Polytechnique, a military academy renowned for excellence in mathematics, science, and engineering. Tutored by mathematician Eug\u00e8ne Charles Catalan, Hermite devoted a year to preparing for the notoriously difficult entrance examination.[2] In 1842 he was admitted to the school.[1] However, after one year the school would not allow Hermite to continue his studies there because of his deformed foot. He struggled to regain his admission to the school, but the administration imposed strict conditions. Hermite did not accept this, and he quit the \u00c9cole Polytechnique without graduating.[2]/nIn 1842, Nouvelles Annales de Math\u00e9matiques published Hermite's first original contribution to mathematics, a simple proof of Niels Abel's proposition concerning the impossibility of an algebraic solution to equations of the fifth degree.[1]/nA correspondence with Carl Jacobi, begun in 1843 and continued the next year, resulted in the insertion, in the complete edition of Jacobi's works, of two articles by Hermite, one concerning the extension to Abelian functions of one of the theorems of Abel on elliptic functions, and the other concerning the transformation of elliptic functions.[1]/nAfter spending five years working privately towards his degree, in which he befriended eminent mathematicians Joseph Bertrand, Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, and Joseph Liouville, he took and passed the examinations for the baccalaur\u00e9at, which he was awarded in 1847.

In July 1848, he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences. In 1856 he contracted smallpox. Through the influence of Augustin-Louis Cauchy and of a nun who nursed him, he resumed the practice of his Catholic faith.[1] From 1862 to 1873 he was lecturer at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. In 1869, he succeeded Jean-Marie Duhamel as professor of mathematics, both at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, where he remained until 1876, and at the University of Paris, where he remained until his death. Upon his 70th birthday, he was promoted to grand officer in the French Legion of Honour.[1]/nHermite died in Paris on 14 January 1901,[1] aged 78./nAn inspiring teacher, Hermite strove to cultivate admiration for simple beauty and discourage rigorous minutiae. His correspondence with Thomas Stieltjes testifies to the great aid he gave those beginning scientific life. His published courses of lectures have exercised a great influence. His important original contributions to pure mathematics, published in the major mathematical journals of the world, dealt chiefly with Abelian and elliptic functions and the theory of numbers./nIn 1858, Hermite showed that equations of the fifth degree and in 1873, he proved that e, the base of the natural system of logarithms, is transcendental.[2] Techniques similar to those used in Hermite's proof of e's transcendence were used by Ferdinand von Lindemann in 1882 to show that \u03c0 is transcendental.[1]/nIn 1858, Hermite showed that equations of the fifth degree could be solved by elliptic modular functions. In his famous work Sur la r\u00e9solution de l'\u00c9quation du cinqui\u00e9me degr\u00e9 Comptes rendus he named the exact elliptical solution expression based on the theta function[3] the Bring Jerrard Normal form. In particular, he recognized how to determine the corresponding elliptic module and its Pythagorean complementary module for the given Bring-Jerrard form. The Bring-Jerrard form only contains the quintic, the linear and the absolute equation term:/nAll Bring-Jerrard equations can be normalized to this form by substituting the internal unknowns. If in the given form the value \n\n\n\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c}\n\n is a real number, then the equation in question has one real and four imaginary solutions. According to the Abel-Ruffini theorem, this Bring's equation cannot be solved elementaryly for the vast majority of values \n\n\n\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c}\n\n or the associated solution set cannot be represented in an elementary radical way. But for all values \n\n\n\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c}\n\n the mentioned Bring-Jerrard equation can be solved elliptically. The five solutions of the quintic equation shown are always obtained completely by setting up rational combinations of the non-elementary so-called Elliptic Modular Functions depending on the Elliptic Nome as an inner function. The Elliptic Nome must be generated by the following elliptic modules or numerical eccentricities \n\n\n\nk\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\nk\n\u2032\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k'}\n\n:/nFor the more accurate derivation, please watch the Article Lemniscate elliptic functions, section Elliptic Modulus and quintic equations!/nThese eccentricities are the corresponding elliptical module and its Pythagorean complementary counterpart in the Legendre's normal form or in the standard form. The two formulas now mentioned result directly from the formula which is at the top of page 258 in the Italian edition of the above-mentioned work Sulla risoluzione delle equazioni del quinto grado, which was further distributed by Francesco Brioschi.

This is how Prasolov and Soloviev determined the expression of the real solution, which they wrote down on page 159 in their work Elliptic Functions and Elliptic Integrals. They used the standardized Weber modular functions in its original form:/nThe following is a list of his works:[1]/nThere exists, if I am not mistaken, an entire world which is the totality of mathematical truths, to which we have access only with our mind, just as a world of physical reality exists, the one like the other independent of ourselves, both of divine creation./nI shall risk nothing on an attempt to prove the transcendence of \u03c0.

Mingozzi et al.[11] Two books by Vladimir Burkov, \"Network models and control problems\"[12] and \"Applied problems of graph theory\" [13] put forward the problems being intensively studied until now./nSince late 1960s interests of Vladimir Burkov shift to the studies of specific nature of human being as a controlled object (an agent).

Under such an incentive-compatible mechanism, truthtelling is beneficial for agents.[14][15] The notion of incentive compatibility was independently proposed by Leonid Hurwitz,[16] and later was extended and elaborated by Allan Gibbard,[17] Roger Myerson,[18] and many other researchers. They pioneered the revelation principle, which opened a new era in the studies of economic institutions (mechanism design and contract theory); it was mentioned as the main achievement[19] in 2007s Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences won by L. Hurwitz, E. Maskin, and R.

During this time period, he also held concurrent appointments as lecturer at Ecole Nationale Naval, and Institut National de Formation en Batiment. In 1995, he held a brief appointment as lecturer at Ecole Militaire Polytechnique, before being appointed by the University of Montreal as a Teaching Assistant, and by Center of Research on Applied Computations (Cerca) as a Research Assistant from 1996 to 2000. Following this, he was appointed as a Research Associate in Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University until 2003. He held his next appointment at the University of Victoria as Assistant Professor Mathematics and Statistics in 2003, and was promoted to associate professor in 2008, and to Full Professor in 2013.[1]/nKhouider's contribution to the community includes his role as an organizer of the conferences and workshops, especially the ones in Banff and Oberwolfach. He has also conducted invited lectures and presentations at various professional institutions, including New York University, DongHua University,[6] and the University of Sciences and Technology Houari Boumedienne.[7]/nKhouider's work mainly focuses on applied mathematics, in particular in the fields of computational fluid dynamics, earth System modelling, sea-ice dynamics modelling, tropical meteorology, tropical extra-tropical interactions, organized convection and convectively coupled waves. His research work has been supported by numerous professional organizations, including Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Research, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, and Pacific Institute for Mathematical Sciences.[8][9]/nKhouider conducted a detailed dynamical analysis for the linear waves in 2006, while developing a systematic model convective parameterization focused on highlighting the dynamic role of the three cloud types, congestus, stratiform, and deep convective cumulus clouds, in terms of exploring the dynamics of large-scale convectively coupled Kelvin waves, westward-propagating two-day waves, and the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation.[10] In a companion paper, he presented a report on idealized nonlinear numerical simulations in the context of the developed model.[11] Furthermore, he highlighted how the adequate representation of the dominant intraseasonal and synoptic-scale variability in the tropics, characterized by the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation (MJO) and convectively coupled waves, continues to be a problem in current operational general circulation models (GCMs).[12]/nKhouider discussed the role of environmental moisture in terms of the deepening of cumulus convection. It was found out that the mixing of water vapor by subgrid-scale turbulence has a significant impact on cloud depth, while the mixing of sensible heat has comparatively a negligible impact.[13] In another study, he presented a paradigm model, and provided the applications of the stochastic multicloud framework in terms of improving deterministic parameterizations with clear deficiencies.[14] Moreover, he along with co-worker, demonstrated the linear stability results for the multicloud model on an equatorial beta plane.[15]/nIn 2010, Khouider developed a stochastic multicloud model to represent the missing variability that occurred in global climate models due to unresolved features of organized tropical convection. Furthermore, he coupled stochastic multicloud model to a simple tropical climate model consisting of a system of ODEs, and highlighted the dynamical features of the coupled model.[16] Using a statistical inference method based on the Bayesian paradigm, he estimated the stochasticity of convection in terms of Giga-LES data.[17] In his study conducted in 2019, he demonstrated the stochastic parametrization of organized convection, and also explored the performance of the stochastic multicloud model in a stand-alone mode where the cloud model is forced directly by the observed predictors without feedback into the environmental variables.[18] Later on, he successfully implemented the stochastic multicloud model in the CFSv2 GCM, used by the Indian Institute for Tropical Meteorology which led to huge improvements of the climate model in terms of simulating tropical modes of variability, including the MJO, monsoon intra-seasonal oscillations, and convectively coupled equatorial waves.[19][20][21]/nKhouider also proposed a non-oscillatory balanced numerical scheme with application to preserve geostrophic steady states with minimal ad hoc dissipation by using state of the art numerical methods for each piece.[22] Furthermore, he explored and highlighted the role of stratiform heating in the context of scale-selection of organized tropical convection over the monsoon trough, while using aquaplanet version of a coarse-resolution atmospheric general circulation model coupled to a stochastic multicloud cumulus parameterization scheme.[23]  In his paper titled \"Climate science in the tropics: waves, vortices and PDEs,\" he presented a review on the interdisciplinary contributions over the last decade through the modus operandi of applied mathematics to most frequently occurring scientific problems. He discussed novel multiscale equations, PDEs, and numerical algorithms with the purpose to persuade mathematicians and physicists to do research in this particular area of study.[24] In a recent study, he conducted a comparative analysis between four theories of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), which lead to a realization that theoretical thinking of the MJO is diverse and understanding of MJO dynamics needs to be further advanced.[25]", "3340709": "Boris Weisfeiler (born 19 April 1941 \u2013 disappeared 4\u20135 January 1985)[1] was a Soviet-born mathematician and professor at Penn State University who lived in the United States before disappearing in Chile in 1985. Declassified US documents suggest a Chilean army patrol seized Weisfeiler and took him to Colonia Dignidad, a secretive Germanic agricultural commune set up in Chile in the 1960s.[2] During the Chilean Pinochet military dictatorship Boris Weisfeiler allegedly drowned. He is known for the Weisfeiler filtration, Weisfeiler\u2013Leman algorithm and Kac\u2013Weisfeiler conjectures./nWeisfeiler, a Jew, was born in the Soviet Union. He received his Ph.D. in 1970 from the Steklov Institute of Mathematics Leningrad Department, as a student of Ernest Vinberg.[3] In the early 1970s, Weisfeiler was asked to sign a letter against a colleague, and for his refusal was branded \"anti-Soviet\". Weisfeiler left the Soviet Union in 1975 to be free to advance his career and practice his religion. After a brief period under Armand Borel at the Institute for Advanced Study, near Princeton University, Weisfeiler became a professor at Pennsylvania State University. In 1981, he was naturalized as an American citizen./nWeisfeiler's research spanned twenty years, and he published three dozen research papers during his lifetime. According to his colleague Alexander Lubotzky, Weisfeiler was studying \"the more difficult questions\" of algebraic groups in \"the case when the field is not algebraically closed and the groups do not split or\u2014even worse\u2014are nonisotropic\".[4] He is known for the Weisfeiler\u2013Leman algorithm,[5] the Kac\u2013Weisfeiler conjectures, the Weisfeiler filtration, and work on strong approximation and on finite linear groups.[6]/nWeisfeiler, an experienced outdoorsman, flew to Chile at Christmas time of 1984 to hike alone in the Chilean Andes. Chile was then under a military dictatorship headed by General Augusto Pinochet, which committed numerous human rights abuses (before he died in 2006, Pinochet had been prosecuted for his role in Operation Colombo and indicted in absentia in other countries). After the effective end of military rule, in 1990, the Chilean government took steps to investigate additional activities under the Pinochet regime./nAccording to Chilean governmental reports, Weisfeiler was hiking near the border of the Colonia Dignidad at the time of his disappearance. Conflicting reports make the details of the disappearance impossible to discern. The Chilean government has ruled that Weisfeiler had entered the confluence of two swift-moving rivers and drowned, his body never to be recovered. Local fishermen say they camped with Boris and gave him directions northward, toward a bridge near the Colonia. Some people claim to have seen his footprints near the river and to have found his backpack and other items (the items may have been sold or destroyed by the Chilean government in the late 1990s, as evidenced by Chilean governmental documents and published news articles).[7]/nAlthough no conclusive proof connects Weisfeiler's disappearance to any entity, some American and Chilean officials do suspect one particular group. Unknown to most of the world, Colonia Dignidad sat on a large tract of land not far from the border with Argentina. Idyllic in appearance, the Colonia was run by German expatriates who included alleged Nazi war criminals and sympathizers. The leader of the Colonia for most of its existence was former Nazi Paul Sch\u00e4fer.[8] The Colonia had a cult-like atmosphere, in which many children were molested, a crime for which its leaders have faced prosecution; Sch\u00e4fer himself was convicted in May 2006 in connection with allegations of child abuse at the Colonia. The BBC has reported and Chilean governmental documents suggest[9] that the Chilean Direcci\u00f3n de Inteligencia Nacional (the secret police, which was disbanded in 1977) brought suspected anti-government prisoners there to be interrogated./nAccording to United States Department of State reports, other witnesses claim they saw Boris Weisfeiler in the Colonia several years after his disappearance. At least one claims he was alive some three years later; another claims he was assassinated as a Soviet or Jewish spy. Weisfeiler's whereabouts remain unknown, and his sister Olga, who, like her brother, emigrated to the United States, continues to petition numerous authorities to determine his fate. Early in 2006, a bipartisan Congressional letter signed by 27 senators and representatives was delivered to Chilean President Michelle Bachelet in the hope of speeding an official Chilean investigation into his fate./nOn August 21, 2012, a Chilean judge ordered the arrest of eight retired police and military officers in connection with the alleged kidnapping and disappearance of Boris Weisfeiler. According to the court filings, the suspects were to have been prosecuted for \"aggravated kidnapping\" and \"complicity\" in the disappearance of a U.S. citizen between January 3\u20135, 1985; the filings did not mention where Weisfeiler might have been taken after his detention or what may have happened to him afterwards. The case was closed in 2016, after the judge ruled the disappearance to be a common crime (for which the statute of limitations had passed), not a violation of human rights.[10]", "1669541": "Lennart Axel Edvard Carleson (born 18 March 1928) is a Swedish mathematician, known as a leader in the field of harmonic analysis. One of his most noted accomplishments is his proof of Lusin's conjecture.[1][2] He was awarded the Abel Prize in 2006 for \"his profound and seminal contributions to harmonic analysis and the theory of smooth dynamical systems.\"[3][4]/nHe was a student of Arne Beurling and received his Ph.D. from Uppsala University in 1950. He did his post-doctoral work at Harvard University where he met and discussed  Fourier series and their convergence with Antoni Zygmund and Rapha\u00ebl Salem who were there in 1950 and 1951. He is a professor emeritus at Uppsala University, the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, and the University of California, Los Angeles, and has served as director of the Mittag-Leffler Institute in Djursholm outside Stockholm 1968\u20131984. Between 1978 and 1982 he served as president of the International Mathematical Union./nCarleson married Butte Jonsson in 1953, and they had two children: Caspar (born 1955) and Beatrice (born 1958)./nHe has supervised 29 PhD students. They include Svante Janson, Kurt Johansson, Warwick Tucker, Bengt Ros\u00e9n, Per Sj\u00f6lin, Hans Wallin and Ingemar Wik./nHis work has included the solution of some outstanding problems, using techniques from  combinatorics and probability theory (especially stopping times). In the theory of Hardy spaces, Carleson's contributions include the corona theorem (1962), and  establishing the almost everywhere convergence of Fourier series for square-integrable functions (now known as Carleson's theorem). It was a famous old problem by Joseph Fourier when he invented Fourier analysis in 1807 and formalised by Nikolai Luzin in 1913 as the Lusin's conjecture. Kolmogorov proved a famous negative result of the conjecture for L1 function in 1928 and stated that the conjecture must be false. It was so until 38 years later when Carleson gave his proof at the International Congress of Mathematicians at Moscow in 1966. But his proofs were very hard and only understood in the late 80s and early 90s when a general theory of operators arrived and brought mathematicians closer to using his striking ideas with ease./nHe is also known for the theory of Carleson measures. His tools and methods have been of fundamental importance to analysis as well as many areas of mathematics. The theorem for Fourier multipliers developed by Carleson and Per Sj\u00f6lin has been standard in the study of the Kakeya problem. In 1974 he solved the extension problem for quasiconformal mappings, and gave important new results in the Bochner\u2013Riesz mean in dimension two./nIn the theory of dynamical systems, Carleson has worked in complex dynamics. His proof with Michael Benedicks of the existence of strange attractors in the H\u00e9non map in 1991 led to a new field in dynamical systems./nIn addition to publishing some landmark papers, Carleson has also published two books: First, an influential book on potential theory, Selected Problems on Exceptional Sets (Van Nostrand, 1967), and  second a book on the iteration of analytic functions, Complex Dynamics (Springer, 1993, in collaboration with T. W. Gamelin). He was the co-editor along with Paul Malliavin, J. Neuberger and J.

Scott Professor of Mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania, specializing in differential geometry, partial differential equations and their applications./nCalabi was born in Milan, Italy on May 11, 1923, into a Jewish family.[1] His sister was the journalist Tullia Zevi Calabi. In 1938, the family left Italy because of the racial laws,  and in 1939 arrived in the United States.[2][3]/nIn the fall of 1939, aged only 16, Calabi enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, studying chemical engineering. His studies were interrupted when he was drafted in the US military in 1943 and served during World War II. Upon his discharge in 1946, Calabi was able to finish his bachelor's degree under the G.I. Bill, and was a Putnam Fellow.[3][4] He received a master's degree in mathematics from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 1947 and his PhD in mathematics from Princeton University in 1950. His doctoral dissertation, titled \"Isometric complex analytic imbedding of K\u00e4hler manifolds\", was done under the supervision of Salomon Bochner.[5]/nFrom 1951 to 1955 he was an assistant professor at Louisiana State University, and he moved to the University of Minnesota in 1955, where he became a full professor in 1960. In 1964, Calabi joined the mathematics faculty at the University of Pennsylvania. Following the retirement of Hans Rademacher, he was appointed to the Thomas A. Scott Professorship of Mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. In 1994, Calabi assumed emeritus status, and in 2014 the university awarded him an honorary doctorate of science.[6][7][8]/nIn 1982, Calabi was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.[9] He won the Leroy P. Steele Prize from the American Mathematical Society in 1991, where his \"fundamental work on global differential geometry, especially complex differential geometry\" was cited as having \"profoundly changed the landscape of the field\".[8] In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[10] In 2021, he was awarded Commander of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.[11][7]/nCalabi married Giuliana Segre in 1952, with whom he had a son and a daughter. He turned 100 on May 11, 2023, and died on September 25.[7][12]/nCalabi made a number of contributions to the field of differential geometry. Other contributions, not discussed here, include the construction of a holomorphic version of the long line with Maxwell Rosenlicht, a study of the moduli space of space forms, a characterization of when a metric can be found so that a given differential form is harmonic, and various works on affine geometry. In the comments on his collected works in 2021, Calabi cited his article \"Improper affine hyperspheres of convex type and a generalization of a theorem by K. J\u00f6rgens\" as that which he was \"most proud of\".[13]/nAt the 1954 International Congress of Mathematicians, Calabi announced a theorem on how the Ricci curvature of a K\u00e4hler metric could be prescribed.[C54] He later found that his proof, via the method of continuity, was flawed, and the result became known as the Calabi conjecture. In 1957, Calabi published a paper in which the conjecture was stated as a proposition, but with an openly incomplete proof.[C57] He gave a complete proof that any solution of the problem must be uniquely defined, but was only able to reduce the problem of existence to the problem of establishing a priori estimates for certain partial differential equations. In the 1970s, Shing-Tung Yau began working on the Calabi conjecture, initially attempting to disprove it. After several years of work, he found a proof of the conjecture, and was able to establish several striking algebro-geometric consequences of its validity. As a particular case of the conjecture, K\u00e4hler metrics with zero Ricci curvature are established on a number of complex manifolds; these are now known as Calabi\u2013Yau metrics. They have become significant in string theory research since the 1980s.[14][15][16]/nIn 1982, Calabi introduced a geometric flow, now known as the Calabi flow, as a proposal for finding K\u00e4hler metrics of constant scalar curvature.[C82a] More broadly, Calabi introduced the notion of an extremal K\u00e4hler metric, and established (among other results) that they provide strict global minima of the Calabi functional and that any constant scalar curvature metric is also a global minimum.[C85] Later, Calabi and Xiuxiong Chen made an extensive study of the metric introduced by Toshiki Mabuchi, and showed that the Calabi flow contracts the Mabuchi distance between any two K\u00e4hler metrics.[CC02] Furthermore, they showed that the Mabuchi metric endows the space of K\u00e4hler metrics with the structure of a Alexandrov space of nonpositive curvature. The technical difficulty of their work is that geodesics in their infinite-dimensional context may have low differentiability.[14]/nA well-known construction of Calabi's puts complete K\u00e4hler metrics on the total spaces of hermitian vector bundles whose curvature is bounded below.[C79] In the case that the base is a complete K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein manifold and the vector bundle has rank one and constant curvature, one obtains a complete K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metric on the total space. In the case of the cotangent bundle of a complex space form, one obtains a hyperk\u00e4hler metric. The Eguchi\u2013Hanson space is a special case of Calabi's construction.[14]/nCalabi found the Laplacian comparison theorem in Riemannian geometry, which relates the Laplace\u2013Beltrami operator, as applied to the Riemannian distance function, to the Ricci curvature.[C58a] The Riemannian distance function is generally not differentiable everywhere, which poses a difficulty in formulating a global version of the theorem. Calabi made use of a generalized notion of differential inequalities, predating the later viscosity solutions introduced by Michael Crandall and Pierre-Louis Lions. By extending the strong maximum principle of Eberhard Hopf to his notion of viscosity solutions, Calabi was able to use his Laplacian comparison theorem to extend recent results of Joseph Keller and Robert Osserman to Riemannian contexts. Further extensions, based on different uses of the maximum principle, were later found by Shiu-Yuen Cheng and Yau, among others.[14][17][18]/nIn parallel to the classical Bernstein problem for minimal surfaces, Calabi considered the analogous problem for maximal surfaces, settling the question in low dimensions.[C70] An unconditional answer was found later by Cheng and Yau, making use of the Calabi trick that Calabi had pioneered to circumvent the non-differentiability of the Riemannian distance function. In analogous work, Calabi had earlier considered the convex solutions of the Monge\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation which are defined on all of Euclidean space and with 'right-hand side' equal to one. Konrad J\u00f6rgens had earlier studied this problem for functions of two variables, proving that any solution is a quadratic polynomial. By interpreting the problem as one of affine geometry, Calabi was able to apply his earlier work on the Laplacian comparison theorem to extend J\u00f6rgens' work to some higher dimensions.[C58b] The problem was completely resolved later by Aleksei Pogorelov, and the result is commonly known as the J\u00f6rgens\u2013Calabi\u2013Pogorelov theorem.[19]/nLater, Calabi considered the problem of affine hyperspheres, first characterizing such surfaces as those for which the Legendre transform solves a certain Monge\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation. By adapting his earlier methods in extending J\u00f6rgens' theorem, Calabi was able to classify the complete affine elliptic hyperspheres.[C72] Further results were later obtained by Cheng and Yau.[19][20]/nCalabi and Beno Eckmann discovered the Calabi\u2013Eckmann manifold in 1953.[CE53] It is notable as a simply-connected complex manifold which does not admit any K\u00e4hler metrics.[21][22]/nInspired by recent work of Kunihiko Kodaira, Calabi and Edoardo Vesentini considered the infinitesimal rigidity of compact holomorphic quotients of Cartan domains.[CV60] Making use of the Bochner technique and Kodaira's developments of sheaf cohomology, they proved the rigidity of higher-dimensional cases. Their work was an influence on the later work of George Mostow and Grigori Margulis, who established their global rigidity results out of attempts to understand infinitesimal rigidity results such as Calabi and Vesentini's, along with related works by Atle Selberg and Andr\u00e9 Weil.[23]/nCalabi and Lawrence Markus considered the problem of space forms of positive curvature in Lorentzian geometry.[CM62] Their results, which Joseph A. Wolf considered \"very surprising\",[24] assert that the fundamental group must be finite, and that the corresponding group of isometries of de Sitter spacetime (under an orientability condition) will act faithfully by isometries on an equatorial sphere. As such, their space form problem reduces to the problem of Riemannian space forms of positive curvature.[25][26]/nWork of John Nash in the 1950s considered the problem of isometric embeddings. His work showed that such embeddings are very flexible and deformable. In his PhD thesis, Calabi had previously considered the special case of holomorphic isometric embeddings into complex-geometric space forms.[C53] A striking result of his shows that such embeddings are completely determined by the intrinsic geometry and the curvature of the space form in question. Moreover, he was able to study the problem of existence via his introduction of the diastatic function, which is a locally defined function built from K\u00e4hler potentials and which mimics the Riemannian distance function. Calabi proved that a holomorphic isometric embedding must preserve the diastatic function. As a consequence, he was able to obtain a criterion for local existence of holomorphic isometric embeddings.[22]/nLater, Calabi studied the two-dimensional minimal surfaces (of high codimension) in round spheres.[C67] He proved that the area of topologically spherical minimal surfaces can only take on a discrete set of values, and that the surfaces themselves are classified by rational curves in a certain hermitian symmetric space.[27][28][29]/nCalabi's collected works were published in 2021:", "5142985": "Jos\u00e9 Antonio Villase\u00f1or y S\u00e1nchez was an 18th-century geographer, historian, and mathematician in New Spain.

His book The Challenges of Economic and Institutional Reforms in Africa[8] influenced practical policy directions on an array of areas during the turbulent 1980s and 1990s./nSaitoti joined politics as a nominated Member of Parliament and Minister for Finance in 1983, rising to become Kenya's longest-serving Vice-President, a proficient Minister for education, Internal Security and Provincial Administration and Foreign Affairs. Few recognise him as a \"reformist\",[citation needed] but his recommendations as the Chair of the KANU Review Committee, popularly known as the \"Saitoti Committee\" in 1990\u201391, opened KANU to internal changes and set the stage for the repeal of Section 2A and Kenya's return to pluralist democracy. Saitoti left KANU and joined the opposition, becoming a kingpin figure in the negotiations that led to the \"NARC Revolution\" in 2002. As Minister for Internal Security and Provincial Administration, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and key member of the National Security Advisory Committee (NSAC), he later worked closely with the national Ministry of Defence to see through the Operation Linda Nchi against the Al-Shabaab insurgent group. In addition, rival factions had for decades invoked the infamous Goldenberg fraud to knock Saitoti out of politics, but the legal courts cleared him of the scandal in July 2006.[9] Saitoti's dual heritage as a Maasai with Kikuyu family members predisposed him to a pan-Kenyan vision, but also denied him a strong ethnic base unlike his competitors. As one of Kenya's most experienced, unassuming and shrewd politicians, Saitoti was billed[by whom?] as a front-runner in the race to succeed President Mwai Kibaki./nGeorge Saitoti was born on 3 August 1945[4][5] and brought up in Maasailand, where he spent his childhood herding cattle in line with the Masai culture, and attending school.[10] He attended Ololua Primary School, Kajiado where he acquired his basic education in the 1950s. Between 1960 and 1963, he secured a place at Mang'u High School in Thika where he attained his high school education. He joined the ranks of Mang'u High School's highly decorated alumni including Kenya's third President, Mwai Kibaki, former Vice-President Moody Awori, Catholic Archbishop Ndingi Mwana-a-Nzeki, the late Environment Minister John Michuki, the late Trade Unionist and former Minister for Justice and Constitutional Affairs, Tom Mboya, and late Cardinal Maurice Michael Otunga./nSaitoti was one of the recipients of the Kennedy Airlift scholarships in 1963 at the age of 18.[11] This was a scholarship program started by Tom Mboya and William X. Scheinmann and supported by the John F. Kennedy foundation and the African American Students Association to address the educational needs of newly independent Kenya. Through this program, hundreds of East Africans studied in the United States of America and Canada.[11] Saitoti studied at Brandeis University between 1963 and 1967 where he was a mathematician. During his time there, he was on the Wien Scholarship, specialising in Mathematics and Economics.[12] His colleagues at the time remember that he enjoyed spending time in Cholmondeleys (the coffeehouse in the Castle) and excelled at high jump, ranking as one of the best in New England.[12] In 1988, Saitoti received the first Brandeis Alumni Achievement Award, the highest honour the university bestows upon its graduates.[12][13]/nSaitoti later moved to the United Kingdom where he acquired a Master of Science (MSc) degree in mathematics from the University of Sussex, Brighton. He enrolled for his doctoral studies at the University of Warwick where he acquired his PhD in mathematics in 1972; writing his dissertation under the supervision of professor Luke Hodgkin in the area of algebraic topology under the topic: Mod-2 K-Theory of the Second Iterated Loop Space on a Sphere.[14]/nUpon his graduation, Saitoti returned to Kenya in 1972, commencing a career as a Mathematics lecturer at the University of Nairobi. One of his contributions was the institutionalisation of Mathematics as a discipline in Africa. During the first Pan-African Conference of Mathematicians held in Rabat, Morocco, in 1976, Saitoti was involved in the creation of the African Mathematical Union (AMU).[15] He was elected the AMU's vice-president, a post which he held on up to 1979.[14] By 1983, Saitoti's academic career was on the rise as associate professor and Head of the Mathematics Department.\nOutside the academy, Saitoti received several public appointments. On 3 November 1972, the Minister of Labour appointed him as the chairman of the Agricultural Wages Council (AWC).[16] On 4 September 1979, the Minister for Tourism and Wildlife, John Ogutu, also appointed him as a committee member of the Natural Sciences Advisory Research Committee (TNSARC) chaired by professor S. O. Wandiga.[17] In September 1983, he was appointed chairperson of the board of directors for the Rift Valley Institute of Science and Technology.[18] He also served in other public capacities as chairman of Mumias Sugar Company and the Kenya Commercial Bank./nTop decision-makers in government had recognised Saitoti as a policy thinker and technocrat, of whom the KANU desperately needed to fix its institutions, politics and the economy. His seminal book, The Challenges of Economic and Institutional Reforms in Africa was widely praised by leading officials as providing practical policy proposals to deal with the various challenges facing Kenya and Africa.[19]\nThe book drew from Saitoti's experience as a seasoned scholar, consultant and experienced policy-maker/thinker, presenting a rigorous and multidisciplinary analysis of strategies for poverty alleviation, sustainable development, poverty reduction, combating HIV/AIDS and peace diplomacy. Saitoti also emphasised the importance of institutional reforms and sound public policies to sustainable economic growth in Africa.[20]/nLong before joining mainstream politics, Saitoti had a stint in the legislative duties. From 1974 to 1977, he represented Kenya in the defunct (since-revived) East African Community as a member of the East African Legislative Assembly.[21]/nIn October 1983, President Daniel arap Moi nominated Saitoti as a member of parliament and subsequently appointed him to the Cabinet as Minister for Finance. He held the position until 1989.[22] During the 1988 general elections, Saitoti entered competitive politics and won the Kajiado North parliamentary seat that was previously held by Philip Odupoy. Prior to the tenure of Adupoy and Saitoti, the Kajiado North multi-ethnic constituency was held by the popular politician, John Keen, another half-Maasai who champion a nationalist vision and worked over the years to ensure the advancement of his mother's people.[23]\nFor more than 25 years, professor George Saitoti has represented Kajiado North since 1988, recapturing the seat in consecutive elections in 1992, 1997, 2002 and 2007. Building on John Keen's legacy of a cosmopolitan constituency, Saitoti transformed Kajiado North into Kenya's most ethnically integrated multi-ethnic legislative area that also provided a safe haven to Kenyans, forcibly displaced by the 1991\u20132008 cycles of ethnic violence in neighbouring areas.[24]/nThe area is also ranked among the top ten wealthiest, economically dynamic and fastest growing regions in Kenya. According to figures released by the Government of Kenya in 2009, Kajiado North has had an average poverty index of 10.66 per cent for the last three years, making it one of the richest constituencies in Kenya (see table 1).[25]/nAfter the 1988 General Election, President Moi appointed Saitoti as Kenya's sixth vice-president. Saitoti became Kenya's longest sitting vice-president serving for 13 years under President Daniel arap Moi between May 1989 and January 1998 and again between April 1999 and August 2002 (see table 2).[26] At the same time, he served as Minister for Finance.\nIn 1990\u20131991, Saitoti was the Executive Chairman of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).[citation needed] In 1999\u20132000, Saitoti also served as president of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States, becoming instrumental in helping negotiate a new development partnership agreement to succeed the previous Lom\u00e8 Convention that expired in February 2000 between the ACP and the European Union.[27]\nThe hallmarks of Saitoti tenure as vice-president were efficiency, sobriety and loyalty as President Moi's most trusted lieutenant. Even when President Moi dithered in naming a new deputy after the 1997 elections, Saitoti was still his favoured choice 14 months down the line.[28] The same traits of efficiency, patience and loyalty would make him one of President Mwai Kibaki's trusted Ministers./nWhen Saitoti was appointed vice-president on 1 May 1989, KANU was back-pedaling on re-democratizing the country. At the same time, the party was fragmented over the succession divide between a sit-tight \"KANU-A\" and a more pro-change \"KANU-B\" led by Saitoti. The new vice-president was, therefore, compelled to walk the tightrope between being the face of change in the ruling party and remaining loyal to his principal who, after re-election as president in 1988, had amended the constitution to increase his power to dismiss judges and widened police powers.\nOn New Year's Day 1990, the vocal cleric Rev. Timothy Njoya called on all Africans to demand a multiparty system of government. Following the Saba Saba riots on 7 July 1990, President Moi announced the formation of the KANU Review Committee under the chairmanship of Prof George Saitoti, popularly known as the Saitoti Committee.[29]/nThe Saitoti Review Committee was mandated to investigate the party's internal electoral and disciplinary conduct.[30] The committee traversed the country collecting people's opinions on the party, astounding foe, friend and critics alike and offering a rare forum for direct criticism and outbursts.[31]\nIn January 1991, KANU's executive committee adopted the recommendation by George Saitoti, that critics of the party cease being expelled but suspended for one or two years.[32]/nThe recommendations of the report were open for debate during the National Delegates Conference at Karasani in Nairobi. President Moi backed the adoption and implementation of the report in toto, against what many speakers at the conference had expected. This opened the reforms gates, eventually setting the stage for the repeal of Section 2A in 1991 that returned Kenya to back to a multiparty system of government.[33] The Saitoti Review Committee thrust the party on the reform path, but also widened internal ideological schisms between \"KANU-A\" conservatives and \"KANU-B\" pro-reformers over the Moi succession question.[34]/nSaitoti was in the eye of a nasty succession storm that rocked KANU before and after the 1997 elections. Maasai purists led by Minister William Ole Ntimama and senior Maasai elders 're-Kikuyunized' Saitoti's dual ancestry, amplifying his Kikuyu family linkages as a scheme to weaken his political base and to challenge his status as a Maasai elder.\nDespite his steadfast loyalty to KANU and President Moi, Saitoti was frequently ignored, humiliated and frustrated by the party and its top echelons. Around the same time Foreign Affairs Minister Robert Ouko was murdered in February 1990, Saitoti claims that attempts were made on his life.[35] After the 1997 general elections, he was dropped as vice-president, although no replacement was appointed. Even as President Moi reappointed him in April 1999, on the roadside in Limuru, Kiambu he made a scathing remark to the effect that: \"I've given back Prof Saitoti the seat of Vice-President, hopefully now your sufurias (pots) will be full of food.\"[24] Months before the general elections of 2002, Saitoti's name was deleted from the list of KANU delegates and his ascendancy to the presidency blocked by 'unknown' party members.[36]\nOn 18 March 2002, when KANU held its national delegates conference at the Kasarani sports complex, the move to block Saitoti from the succession game was manifest.[37] The meeting amended the party constitution to allow for the merger between KANU and Raila Odinga's National Development Party (NDP) to create the \"New KANU\". But it also introduced four new positions of party vice-chairmen primarily to water down Saitoti's position as vice-president and Moi's most likely successor as president.[38]/nIt was clear that Moi did not even want him as one of the four vice-chairmen posts reserved for Uhuru Kenyatta, Kalonzo Musyoka, Katana Ngala and Musalia Mudavadi. Moi told Saitoti to his face that he was not \"presidential material\".[28] As a \"Maasai-Kikuyu,\" Saitoti lacked the ethnic numbers he needed in the political horse-trading in Moi's power game. Instead, Moi finger-pointed as his heir Uhuru Kenyatta, perceived to have a large ethnic base as a pure-bred Kikuyu with the \"Kenyatta\" mystique.\nSaitoti gracefully bowed out of the race, living to fight another day, but not without his famous line: There comes a time when the nation is much more important than an individual.[39][40]\nBut the KANU-NDP marriage came to a tragic end when Moi named Uhuru rather than Raila Odinga as his successor.[41] In August 2002, Odinga left KANU to defeat Moi's \"use and dump game,\"[42] and joined a group of KANU rebels\" coalesced around the \"Rainbow Alliance\" lobby that later transformed itself into the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Saitoti also walking out of KANU and became a key LDP figure. In October 2002, LDP joined the National Alliance of Kenya (NAK) of Mwai Kibaki, Charity Ngilu and Wamalwa Kijana to form the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC).[42] Saitoti became a member of the NARC Summit, the highest organ of the coalition./nWhen the NARC flag-bearer, Mwai Kibaki, decisively defeated KANU and Uhuru Kenyatta, Saitoti was appointed to the Ministry of Education. He was the man in charge of implementing NARC's flagship and globally acclaimed free primary education in Kenya.[43]/nAfter 2004, as the NARC consensus crumbled, Saitoti left the agitating LDP camp and threw his lot behind President Kibaki.[44] He canvassed for the government-sponsored draft Constitution, which lost to a combined KANU-LDP campaign during the November 2005 referendum.[45] During the 2007 elections, Saitoti defended his Kajiado North parliamentary seat on the Party of National Unity (PNU) ticket, Kibaki's re-election vehicle, launched three months to the election on 16 September 2007.\nThe courts ordered a vote recount in Kajiado North, but Saitoti beat his closest competitor, Moses Ole Sakuda with close to 20,000 votes.[46] Saitoti blamed his re-election glitch on intrigues of power by KANU forces within the PNU campaign which underwrote his rivals to knock him out of politics and potentially out of the 2012 Presidential elections. But he had remained reticent about it./nSaitoti's traits of patience, efficiency and loyalty to Kibaki paid off. On 8 January 2008, he was appointed Minister of State for Internal Security and Provincial Administration in the Office of the President, a position previously occupied by a Kibaki confidant, John Michuki.[47] Saitoti retained the Internal Security docket even after President Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga established the power-sharing government that ended the 2008 post-election crisis. Between October 2010 and August 2011, Saitoti was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs on an acting capacity after the incumbent, Moses Wetangula, stepped aside to allow investigations on alleged corruption.[48]/nIn July 2009, Saitoti was appointed to head a special cabinet sub-committee formed to oversee the affairs of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in Kenya.[49] Members of this bi-partisan committee include; George Saitoti, Mutula Kilonzo and Moses Wetangula (PNU) and James Orengo, Otieno Kajwang and Amason Kingi (ODM). (Following a cabinet reshuffle in April 2012, Eugene Wamalwa and Prof. Sam Ongeri have replaced Kilonzo and Wetangula). The role of the sub-Committee as a liaison and co-ordination body between the ICC and the Kenyan government took a center-stage from December 2010 when the ICC Chief Prosecutor, Luis Moreno Ocampo, indicted six prominent Kenyans for alleged crimes against humanity relating to the 2008 post-election violence./nAs the Minister of Internal Security and the chairman of the Cabinet Sub-committee on ICC on YouTube and security matters, Saitoti is the guarantor of the government's commitment to the ICC process. Arising from this, several analysts have claimed the suspects' fate lie with the sub-committee.[50] Saitoti came out strongly criticising the invocation of President Kibaki in the ICC debate, calling for sobriety from politicians.[51] Saitoti has maintained a legal interpretation on whether the suspects can vie for presidency in the coming elections, stressing that only the constitution can bar or let them free to enter the race.[52]/nOn 19 December 2008, President Mwai Kibaki who was unanimously endorsed as Party Leader at the PNU National Delegates Conference (NDC) held at Kasarani sports complex in Nairobi.[53][54] In accordance with the Political Parties Act (2008), Saitoti was elected PNU chairman, becoming the second-in-command in the party hierarchy since he lost as KANU Vice-President in the battle for the Moi succession in March 2002.[55] His elevation, however, complicated coalition politics and raised the stakes for the Kibaki succession in PNU.[56] Other presidential hopefuls, Uhuru Kenyatta and Kalonzo Musyoka, shunned the party and embarked on consolidating their respective parties.\nIn November 2010, Musyoka, Kenyatta and Saitoti signed a protocol to form and transform the PNU Alliance into a common political vehicle for the 2013 presidential race.[57] But the imperative to comply with the Political Parties Act (2011) forced them to abandon the Alliance and shift attention to their respective parties.[58]/nSaitoti was both Vice-President and Finance Minister at the height of the 1991\u20131993 Goldenberg scandal. Even though his own culpability in the fraud has never been established, for decades the Goldenberg has become the proverbial Sword of Damocles used against Saitoti in intra-elite power wars. In early 1999, Raila Odinga as a presidential contender to succeed Moi as president, sued Saitoti and others over alleged role in the Goldenberg scandal.[42] Three months after his re-appointment as vice-president on 3 April 1999, Otieno Kajwang', a Raila ally, moved a private member's motion of no confidence in the vice-president for his alleged role in the Goldenberg fraud. Saitoti survived the onslaught.[42]/nThe Goldenberg spectre returned to haunt Saitoti in the wake of the fierce political infighting between the LDP/KANU faction and Kibaki supporters in NARC that followed the 2005 referendum. On 3 February 2006 a report by the Goldenberg Commission of Inquiry, chaired by Justice Samuel Bosire, recommended that George Saitoti should face criminal charges for his involvement in the Goldenberg scandal.[59][60] On 13 February 2006, Saitoti voluntarily stepped aside from his ministerial docket to pave way for investigations into the allegations.[61]\nHowever, on 31 July 2006, a three-judge bench headed by Justice Joseph Nyamu issued a certiorari order clearing Prof Saitoti of any wrongdoing, expunging his name from the Bosire Commission Report and issuing an order on permanent stay of prosecution against Saitoti.[62]/nIn dismissing the 23 paragraphs of the report, the High Court bench cited three inter-related errors of commission and omission by the Bosire Commission:/nOn 15 November 2006, President Kibaki reappointed Saitoti back to Cabinet.[63]\nIn April 2012, the vetting board found Justice Samuel Bosire unfit to serve in the judiciary citing fails as the Chairman of the Goldenberg Commission of Inquiry. He ignored a High Court Order to summon retired President Daniel arap Moi, Musalia Mudavadi and Nicholas Biwott as witnesses. The vetting board also accused Justice Nyamu of undermining public confidence in the courts for issuing a permanent stay of prosecution against Saitoti./nStarting October 2011, Saitoti worked closely with national Minister of Defence Mohamed Yusuf Haji to see through Linda Nchi,[64] a coordinated operation in southern Somalia between the Somali military and the Kenyan military against the Al-Shabaab group of insurgents.[65][66] The mission was officially led by the Somali army, with the Kenyan forces providing a support role.[66] In early June 2012, Haji signed another agreement re-hatting Kenya's deployed military forces in Somalia under the AMISOM general command.[64]/nIn November 2011, Saitoti confirmed that he was in the race to succeed President Kibaki, who is set to retire after the next general election. Saitoti reiterated his candidature in January 2012,[67] continuing to tour Kenya, with meet-the-people excursions to the Rift Valley, Eastern and Central provinces./nIt appeared to be history repeating itself in the battle for the soul of the Kikuyu between, Saitoti, a Maasai with Kikuyu kith and kin, and Uhuru Kenyatta, a thorough-bred Kikuyu. Uhuru is widely thought as the presumptive successor to President Kibaki, but Saitoti was emerging also, as a likely candidate. In the event that Uhuru's run for the presidency is thwarted by the confirmed charges by the ICC, it remains a too-up as to whether Saitoti would have benefited from the spin-off.[24]/nSaitoti was a businessman who had interests in agriculture, horticulture, real estates, hospitality and pastoralism./nSaitoti's family life received little publicity. His wife, Margaret Saitoti, was with him when the High Court dropped charges in the 16-year Goldenberg case.[62] His brother, Ronald Musengi, has been a banking executive with the Kenya Commercial Bank. In February 2012, Ronald Musengi applied to be a member of the National Police Service Commission.[68]/nSaitoti died on Sunday 10 June 2012 at around 9:00\u00a0am when a Eurocopter AS350 helicopter belonging to the Kenya Police Air Wing registration 5Y-CDT,[69] carrying him and the Assistant Minister for Internal Security, Joshua Orwa Ojode, crashed in the Kibiku area of Ngong forest, killing them and four others.[70] He was buried on 16 June in Kajiado North constituency. After the Maasai elders agreed to abandon the traditional burial rites and embrace the Catholic way, fifty bulls were slaughtered at the funeral in accordance with Maasai tradition.[71] Al Shabaab militias and drug traffickers are the main suspects for the disaster. Investigations have not yet found anyone guilty.[1]  Saitoti was to table a ministerial statement in Parliament.[72]/nSaitoti, G.

His astronomical celestial globe featured a liquid-driven escapement, the first in a long tradition of Chinese astronomical clockworks./nIn the early 8th century, the Tang court put Yi Xing in charge of an astrogeodetic survey.[1] This survey had many purposes. It was established in order to obtain new astronomical data that would aid in the prediction of solar eclipses.[1] The survey was also initiated so that flaws in the calendar system could be corrected and a new, updated calendar installed in its place.[1] The survey was also essential in determining the arc measurement, i.e., the length of meridian arc[1]-although Yi Xing, who did not know the Earth was spherical, did not conceptualize his measurements in these terms. This would resolve the confusion created by the earlier practice of using the difference between shadow lengths of the sun observed at the same time at two places to determine the ground distance between them.[1]/nYi Xing had thirteen test sites established throughout the empire, extending from Jiaozhou in Vietnam \u2014 at latitude 17\u00b0N \u2014 to the region immediately south of Lake Baikal \u2014 latitude 50\u00b0N.[2] There were three observations done for each site, one for the height of polaris, one for the shadow lengths of summer, and one for the shadow lengths of winter.[2] The latitudes were determined from this data, while the Tang calculation for the length of one degree of meridian was fairly accurate compared to modern calculations.[2] Yi Xing understood the variations in the length of a degree of meridian, and criticized earlier scholars who permanently fixed an estimate for shadow lengths for the duration of the entire year.[2]/nYi Xing was famed for his genius, known to have calculated the number of possible positions on a go board game (though without a symbol for zero as he had difficulties expressing the number). He, along with his associate, the mechanical engineer and politician Liang Lingzan, is best known for applying the earliest-known escapement mechanism to a water-powered celestial globe. However, Yi Xing's mechanical achievements were built upon the knowledge and efforts of previous Chinese mechanical engineers, such as the statesman and master of gear systems Zhang Heng (78\u2013139) of the Han Dynasty, the mechanical engineer Ma Jun (200\u2013265) of the Three Kingdoms, and the Daoist Li Lan (c. 450) of the Southern and Northern Dynasties period./nIt was the earlier Chinese inventor Zhang Heng during the Han dynasty who was the first to apply hydraulic power (i.e. a waterwheel and water clock) in mechanically-driving and rotating his equatorial armillary sphere. The arrangement followed the model of a water-wheel using the drip of a clepsydra (see water clock), which ultimately exerted force on a lug to rotate toothed-gears on a polar-axis shaft.[3] With this, the slow computational movement rotated the armillary sphere according to the recorded movements of the planets and stars. Yi Xing also owed much to the scholarly followers of Ma Jun, who had employed horizontal jack-wheels and other mechanical toys worked by waterwheels.[3] The Daoist Li Lan was an expert at working with water clocks, creating steelyard balances for weighing water that was used in the tank of the clepsydra,[3] providing more inspiration for Yi Xing. Like the earlier water-power employed by Zhang Heng and the later escapement mechanism in the astronomical clock tower engineered and erected by Su Song (1020\u20131101), Yi Xing's celestial globe employed water-power in order for it to rotate and function properly.[4] The British biochemist, historian, and sinologist Joseph Needham states (Wade\u2013Giles spelling):/nWhen the first escapement came, in +725 (AD), I-Hsing and Liang Ling-tsan arranged for two jacks to strike the hours, standing on the horizon surface of their sphere or globe.[5]/nIn regards to mercury instead of water (as noted in the quote above), the first to apply liquid mercury for motive power of an armillary sphere was Zhang Sixun in 979 AD (because mercury would not freeze during winter).[6][7] During his age, the Song dynasty (960\u20131279) era historical text of the Song Shi mentions Yi Xing and the reason why his armillary sphere did not survive the ages after the Tang (Wade\u2013Giles spelling):/nA jade balancing mechanism (yu heng)(ie. the escapement) is erected behind (lit. outside) a curtain, holding and resisting (chhih o) the main scoops (shu tou). Water pours down rotating the wheel (chu shui chi lun). Lower, there is a cog-wheel (chi lun) with 43 (teeth). There are also hooks, pins, and interlocking rods one holding another (kou chien chiao tsho hsiang chhih). Each (wheel) moves the next without reliance on any human force. The fastest wheel turns round each day through 2928 teeth (chhih), the slowest one moves by 1 tooth in every 5 days. Such a great difference is there between the speed of the wheels, yet all of them depend on one single driving mechanism. In precision, the engine can be compared with Nature itself (lit. the maker of all things; tsao wu che). As for the rest, it is much the same as the apparatus made (long ago) by I-Hsing. But that old design employed mainly bronze and iron, which corroded and rusted so that the machine ceased to be able to move automatically. The modern plan substitutes hard wood for these parts, as beautiful as jade...[8]/nEarlier Tang era historical texts of the 9th century have this to say of Yi Xing's work in astronomical instruments in the 8th century (Wade\u2013Giles spelling):/nOne (of these) was made in the image of the round heavens (yuan thien chih hsiang) and on it were shown the lunar mansions (hsiu) in their order, the equator and the degrees of the heavenly circumference. Water, flowing (into scoops), turned a wheel automatically (chu shui chi lun, ling chhi tzu chuan), rotating it (the sphere) one complete revolution in one day and night. Besides this, there were two rings (lit. wheels) fitted round the celestial (sphere) outside, having the sun and moon threaded on them, and there were made to move in circling orbit (ling te yun hsing). Each day as the celestial (sphere) turned one revolution westwards, the sun made its way one degree eastwards, and the moon 13 and 7/19 degrees (eastwards). After 29 and a fraction rotations (of the celestial sphere) the sun and moon met. After it made 365 rotations the sun accomplished its complete circuit. And they made a wooden casing the surface of which represented the horizon, since the instrument was half sunk in it. This permitted the exact determinations of the times of dawns and dusks, full and new moons, tarrying and hurrying. Moreover there were two wooden jacks standing on the horizon surface, having one a bell and the other a drum in front of it, the bell being struck automatically to indicate the hours, and the drum being beaten automatically to indicate the quarters.[9]/nAll these motions were brought about (by machinery) within the casing, each depending on wheels and shafts (lun chu), hooks, pins and interlocking rods (kou chien chiao tsho), coupling devices and locks checking mutually (kuan so hsiang chhih)(ie. the escapement). Since (the clock) showed good agreement with the Tao of Heaven, everyone at that time praised its ingenuity. When it was all completed (in +725) it was called the 'Water-Driven Spherical Bird's-Eye-View Map of the Heavens (Shui Yun Hun Thien Fu Shih Thu) or 'Celestial Sphere Model Water-Engine' and was set up in front of the Wu Chheng Hall (of the Palace) to be seen by the multitude of officials. Candidates in the imperial examinations (in +730) were asked to write an essay on the new armillary (clock). But not very long afterwards the mechanism of bronze and iron began to corrode and rust, so that the instrument could no longer rotate automatically. It was therefore relegated to the (museum of the) College of All Sages (Chi Hsien Yuan) and went out of use.[10]/nYi Xing wrote a commentary on the Mahavairocana Tantra. This work had a strong influence on the Japanese monk K\u016bkai and was key in his establishment of Shingon Buddhism.[11]/nAt the Tiantai-Buddhist Guoqing Temple of Mount Tiantai in Zhejiang Province, there is a Chinese pagoda erected directly outside the temple known as the Memorial Pagoda of Monk Yi Xing.

After an introduction on conic sections with concise proofs, Hayes applied Newton's method systematically, first to obtain the tangents of curves, then their areas, and lastly to problems of maxima and minima. His preface shows he was well read in mathematical literature. In 1710 he printed a pamphlet, New and Easy Method to find out the Longitude; and in 1723 The Moon, a Philosophical Dialogue, arguing that she is not opaque, but has some light of her own.[1]/nAfter studying Hebrew, Hayes in 1736 published his Vindication of the History of the Septuagint, and in 1738 Critical Examination of the Holy Gospels according to St. Matthew and St. Luke, with regard to the history of Christ's birth and infancy.

He is also known by the name Adam Riese.[1]/nAlmost nothing is known about Ries' childhood, youth and education. The exact year of his birth is not known. The caption on the only known contemporary portrait of the mathematician reads: ANNO 1550 ADAM RIES SEINS ALTERS IM LVIII. So apparently he was in his 58th year of age at the time of the picture, which was made in 1550. From this it can be deduced that he was born in 1492 or 1493./nThe location of his birth, Staffelstein, can be determined with certainty, since he gives information about himself in the preface to his book, Co\u00df. His father was the owner of the mill there, Contz Ries, and his mother, Eva Kittler, was his father's second wife./nThe first decades after Ries' birth are not documented, so it is not known which schools he attended. There is also no information about his studies in the matriculation registers of the universities./nThe first time that Adam Ries was mentioned in a document was on 22 April 1517, when he appeared before the Council of Staffelstein because of a dispute over an inheritance. By 1509, he was already living in Zwickau with his younger brother, Conrad, who attended the Latin school there. In 1518, Ries went to Erfurt, where he ran a mathematics school, and he wrote two of his mathematics books and had them published there./nIn 1522 or 1523, he moved to the newly founded mining town of Annaberg where he spent the rest of his life. There he finished work on the manuscript of his algebra textbook, Co\u00df, in 1524, although the book was not published until 1992 by B.G. Teubner. During this time, Ries became acquainted with Anna Leuber, the daughter of Freiberg master fitter, Andreas Leuber. The wedding of the couple was mentioned in the register of the St. Anne's Church in Annaberg in 1525. In the same year, he took the oath of citizenship, purchased a house in Johannisgasse in Annaberg and settled down. He first earned his living as a Rezessschreiber (a person who checked the calculations of the mines), and later as a Gegenschreiber (a bookkeeper of the mines) and Zehntner (regional financial administrator). In 1539, he bought \"Riesenburg\", a small castle outside of the town, whose buildings still bear his name today. After his last work appeared in print in 1550, Ries died on 30 March 1559. Because of scanty information, it is not known where he is buried, whether in Annaberg, the Riesenburg or elsewhere./nRies and his wife had at least eight children. Three of the five sons, Adam, Abraham, and Jacob, were all active as mathematicians in Annaberg at times. While Abraham and Jacob died in their home town in 1604, Adam is supposed to have settled in the Harz mountains. The fourth son, Isaac, moved to Leipzig, where he was active as a Visierer (a master of weights and measures). Paul, the fifth son, was a landowner and judge in Wiesa. The three daughters, Eva, Anna and Sybilla, all married in Annaberg./nAdam Ries' descendants are the subject of constant, detailed genealogical research. Great numbers of his descendants still live in the upper Ore Mountains today. The Adam-Ries-Bund (Adam Ries Association, see external links) has taken on the task of researching all of the descendants of Adam Ries and, to date, has more than 20,000 direct descendants in its continually updated database./nRies did not write his works in Latin, as was usual at that time, but in German.[3]/nSince the spelling of names was not as fixed at that time as it is today, the contemporary spellings \"Ris, \"Rise\", \"Ryse\" and even \"Reye\u00df\" are also sometimes found./nIn today's usage, both variants of his name, \"Ries\" and \"Riese\", can be found. The latter is usual in the German expression \"nach Adam Riese\" which means \"according to Adam Ries\" and it is used when speaking about simple arithmetic, e.g. zwei und zwei macht, nach Adam Riese, vier (two plus two is, according to Adam Ries, four). Furthermore, the German word \"Riese\" can be translated as \"giant\" in English, thus inspiring a common tongue-in-cheek adaptation of the beforementioned saying, \"nach Adam Riese und Eva Zwerg\" (\"according to Adam Giant and Eve Dwarf)./nThe Nysa family main-belt asteroid 7655 Adamries was named after him in 1997./nOn the occasion of the 400th birthday of Adam Ries, the Annaberg Historical Society decided in 1891 to put up a monument to the mathematician. The sculpture by the Dresden sculptor, Henze, was not dedicated until 5 November 1893 because of financial difficulties. In 1943, the bronze bust was melted to make armaments and it was replaced ten years later by a sandstone copy. At the end of the 1970s, this was completely removed from the town because of fears that its condition would continue to deteriorate due to the material. In 1991, a new sandstone bust was exhibited in its current position.

Written in a non-academic style, it begins with Turing's family history and early childhood, continuing with his contributions to Britain's cryptanalysis and encryption efforts in World War II and culminating in Turing's conviction for homosexuality and his later suicide./nIt also discusses Turing's contributions to computer science both before and after the war, omitting technical details. It contains previously unpublished material such as photographs and letters, in particular describing the nature of Turing's work in World War II between 1942 and 1945, much of which was not public knowledge beforehand. Reviews of it are mostly positive./nAlan Turing (1912\u20131954) was a 20th-century mathematician and a significant early contributor to the fields of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. He is well known for his work on cryptanalysis of the Enigma during World War II, to help decode German military intelligence.[1] Sir Dermot Turing is the nephew of Alan Turing and the twelfth of the Turing baronets.[2] His father John Turing was Alan's elder brother.[3] Whilst writing the book, Dermot Turing served as director of the Bletchley Park Trust, allowing him access to previously unpublished works.[2][4]/nAndrew Hodges' 1983 biography Alan Turing: The Enigma (new edition in 2012) is considered the standard reference work for Turing's life and works.[3][5] Prof: Alan Turing Decoded is considerably shorter, not written in an academic style and does not cover technical details of Turing's work.[3][4] Dermot Turing used The Enigma as a reference work. Other literature includes Alan M. Turing (1959, new edition in 2012), by his mother Ethel Sara Turing, and Turing: The Pioneer of the Information Age (2012) by Jack Copeland.[3][6] In 2014, a movie about Turing entitled The Imitation Game had been released.[7]/nPrior to the book's release, little was known of Turing's war efforts between 1942 and 1945, after his work on code-breaking had ended. The book contains information on Turing's work on encryption of telegraph, radio and voice communication\u2014including efforts to prevent eavesdropping on communications between UK prime minister Winston Churchill and US president Franklin D. Roosevelt. This information came from documents held by the UK government's intelligence organisation, GCHQ, which they were in the process of releasing publicly.[5][7]/nThe book contains novel information which undermines suggestions that Turing's suicide was subject to an official cover-up. Dermot Turing found correspondence from his father indicating that Turing was having relationship issues with a man named Roy near to his death.[7] He also published excerpts from letters Turing wrote to his friend Nick Furbank, relating to Turing's chemical castration and relationship with his mother after he was convicted for homosexuality.[8] The book also contains previously unpublished photographs of Turing on holiday as a young boy.[9] Dermot Turing disputed a popular perception of Alan Turing as solitary in nature.[4][5][9] People found that Turing was difficult to understand rather than deliberately uncooperative, and though he may have been uncomfortable around new people, he was \"vibrant, humorous, fun to be with and social\" amongst his friends.[7]/nThe book consists of eleven chapters, in addition to an introduction and epilogue. Its title's use of the word \"prof\" is a reference to a nickname given to Turing by Bletchley Park colleagues, though he never held a professorship role. The first chapter, \"Unreliable Ancestors\", details Turing's family history, particularly their role in Colonial India and the radiology accomplishments of two of the women. \"Dismal Childhoods\" is about Turing's early upbringing: his mother returned to India when he was four months old, and he and his older brother John were raised by the Ward family./nThe chapters \"Direction of Travel\" and \"Kingsman\" document Turing's development to adulthood, from his attendance at the boarding school Sherborne School to his studies at King's College, Cambridge, where he was elected a fellow at the age of 22. \"Machinery of Logic\" follows Turing's graduate study under Alonzo Church at Princeton University./nIn \"Prof\" and \"Looking Glass War\", Dermot Turing writes about his uncle's role in World War II, where he worked on code-breaking for Britain at Bletchley Park and then on encrypting voice communications. The book also details the cracking of German teleprinter ciphers with the codename \"fish\" and the research and development of the Colossus computers. \"Lousy Computer\" and \"Taking Shape\" follow Turing's work at the National Physical Laboratory and Victoria University of Manchester, respectively. In the latter, he worked on an early stored-program computer, the Manchester Mark 1, and became interested in overlap between mathematics and biology./nThe focus of \"Machinery of Justice\" is the legal case and consequences of Turing's conviction for sexual relations with a man. The final chapter, \"Unseen Worlds\", describes Turing's ideas in the areas of biology and zoology. The epilogue, titled \"Alan Turing Decoded\", features condolences and messages of appreciation from family members and others.[2][3]/nChris Christensen of Cryptologia reviewed that the book is a \"good first choice\" for a biography of Turing, whilst Nick Smith of Engineering & Technology praised that \"no engineer's library is complete without it\".[3][5]\nClare Mulley of History Today complimented the book's \"personable\" tone and \"stylistic flourishes\",[4] and both Mulley and Nick Smith of Engineering & Technology wrote positively of its anecdotal style.[4][5] Mulley found that it contributes towards \"a more nuanced picture of the human side of Turing\". In comparison to other biographies, Mulley reviewed that the book \"neither ignores nor elevates the importance of [Alan Turing's] sexuality\".[4]/nDavid H. Hamer of Cryptologia praised the work's coverage of Bletchley Park and the development of the computer.[2] However, Christensen noted some minor inaccuracies in the book. Group theory's invention was incorrectly attributed to John von Neumann, the controversy of Bayesian statistics is exaggerated and Christensen criticised an analogy of the bombe to Turing machines as defined in Turing's On Computable Numbers.[3] Hamer and Christensen both expressed frustration at the lack of an index, but praised the book's frequent illustrations.[2][3]/nAs well as in print, the book has been released in audiobook form, with a Chinese translation available and a special edition released for GCHQ.", "1014272": "Hartley Rogers Jr. (July 6, 1926 \u2013 July 17, 2015) was an American mathematician who worked in computability theory, and was a professor in the Mathematics Department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology./nBorn in 1926 in Buffalo, New York,[1] he studied under Alonzo Church at Princeton, and received his Ph.D. there in 1952.

His precepts placed him in opposition with Claude Perrault in the larger culture war known under the heading Querelle des anciens et des modernes. If Fran\u00e7ois Blondel was not the most highly reputed among the acad\u00e9miciens of his day, his were the writings that most generally circulated among the general public, the Cours de Math\u00e9matiques, the Art de jetter les Bombes, the Nouvelle mani\u00e8re de fortifier les places and, above all his  Cours d'Architecture./nBorn Nicolas-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel at Ribemont in the Picardy region of France, he was baptized on 15 June 1618. His father was Fran\u00e7ois-Guillaume Blondel, who studied law in Toulouse and bought the position of avocat du roi in Ribemont after receiving his degree in 1624. Nicolas-Fran\u00e7ois' mother was Marie de Louen, whose family belonged to the local nobility. Although his father Fran\u00e7ois-Guillaume was not born a nobleman, he was able to purchase (or inherit via his wife's relations) two close by seigneuries, Gaillardon in 1620 and Les Croisettes before 1635, and was the mayor of Ribemont several times in the 1630s and 1640s.[3] Nicolas-Fran\u00e7ois was well educated in languages as a youth, and participated for a time in the Thirty Years' War./nIn 1640 Cardinal Richelieu entrusted Blondel with diplomatic missions in Portugal, Spain and Italy, which gave him an opportunity to study at first hand the fortification systems of those nations. He returned from Italy with a greatly enhanced knowledge of mathematics, and it may have been during this trip that he met Galileo, with whom he later claimed to have studied personally. Blondel subsequently became one of Galileo's earliest French supporters.[4]/nRichelieu named Blondel sub-lieutenant of one of his galleys, La Cardinale, aboard which he participated in the attack on the port of Tarragona and served for a time as governor at Palamos. In 1647 Blondel commanded the artillery of the naval expedition against the Spanish at Naples. With the peace he finished his military career with the brevet of  mar\u00e9chal des camps (26 November 1652)./nAround 1648 Blondel received his first architectural commission, the grand stables at the Ch\u00e2teau de Chaumont-la-Guiche in Saint-Bonnet-de-Joux in southern Burgundy. The stables were executed 1648\u20131652 by the local mason and entrepreneur Fran\u00e7ois Martel, to whom the design has frequently been attributed. However, Blondel mentions that he was responsible in a note in his 1685 edition of Louis Savot's L'architecture fran\u00e7oise, and, according to his biographer Anthony Gerbino, there is no reason to question Blondel's claim.[6]\nThe cross-vaulted ground floor is divided into three aisles by two Tuscan arcades with stalls for more than eighty horses.[7]\nOn the exterior of the entrance front are two impressive double staircases ascending to a large hall on the upper floor. They frame the central portal, strikingly surmounted by a life-sized equestrian statue of the previous seigneur, Philibert de La Guiche. His daughter, Henriette de La Guiche built the stables for her husband, who at the time was Louis-Emmanuel de Valois, comte d'Alais\u00a0[fr], the governor of Provence and a grandson of Charles IX of France. Alais also owned the Ch\u00e2teau d'\u00c9couen. These royal connections account for the monumentality of the design. Alais probably met Blondel in the military.[8]/nIn 1652 Blondel became the tutor of the son of the Secretary of State for foreign affairs, Lom\u00e9nie de Brienne, with whom he made the Grand Tour\u00a0: Langres \u2014 Besan\u00e7on \u2014 Basel \u2014 Alsace (Brisach) \u2014 Strasbourg (where he inspected the mechanism of the famous clock) \u2014 Philippsburg \u2014 Mannheim \u2014 Mayence \u2014 The Hague \u2014 Hamburg \u2014 L\u00fcbeck \u2014 Kiel \u2014 Denmark \u2014 Sweden (Stockholm, Uppsala) \u2014 Finland \u2014 Estonia (Riga) \u2014 K\u00f6nigsberg \u2014 Dantzig \u2014 Cracow \u2014 Pressburg \u2014 Vienna \u2014 Prague \u2014 Vence \u2014 Rome \u2014 Florence \u2014 Toulon. His travels would stand him in good stead when he came to compile his Cours d'Architecture. During the 1660s Blondel made a second tour with a son of Jean Baptiste Colbert, of which the itinerary is less known./nIn 1656, Blondel was named reader in Mathematics and Fortification at the Coll\u00e8ge Royal, where his place was filled during his numerous absences by the astronomer Picard. From 1662 to 1668, Blondel exercised the functions of Syndic of the  college./nIn the years 1657 to 1663 Mazarin sent him on diplomatic missions in Italy, Egypt, Greece, Turkey, Germany, Poland, Moscow (where he regretted not having seen the fortifications at Kazan against the Tatars, and found that the maritime defenses were in the Dutch manner), Prussia, Livonia (with the Swedish fortifications of Riga), and Lithuania. In the course of his travels he encountered Paul Wurz, occasioning the correspondence that resulted in Blondel's first publication, a mathematical pamphlet entitled Epistola ad P. W. [Paulum Wurzium], which discussed the breaking resistance of beams.[9] Blondel demonstrates that a mathematical proof of Galileo, allowing the cross-section of a beam to be parabolically shaped such that its weight was reduced by one third, only applied to cantilevered beams and did not apply to the specified aim, a beam supported at both ends, for which a semicircular or elliptical shape would apply.[10] Some of these questions were taken up again in 1673, when he published his R\u00e9solution des quatre principaux probl\u00e8mes d'Architecture./nIn 1659, on a voyage to Constantinople he saw an aqueduct \"in a place that one calls Belgrade, which by its grandeur, its height and the magnificence of its structure, cedes nothing to that of the Pont du Gard.\"[11] That same year he was posted as diplomatic resident to Copenhagen, and post he filled until 1663, when he was recalled to France to become a conseiller d'\u00c9tat./nThe following year, 1664, Colbert named him Ing\u00e9nieur du Roy pour la Marine, which occasioned his supervision of harbour fortifications in Normandy (Cherbourg, Le Havre), in Brittany and in the Antillies (Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint-Domingue), where he witnessed at first hand the prodigious effects of a hurricane at the island of Saint-Christophe, and where he found the materials for numerous memoires presented to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences./nQuatrem\u00e8re de Quincy reported that Blondel's talents for architecture were first tested in 1665, in building the royal corderie (ropewalk) at Rochefort. Blondel was also put in charge of constructing the Roman bridge at Saintes./nIn 1669, Blondel was admitted to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences as a geometer (cartographer).[12] That year, in the course of a trip to London in the company of Jean-Baptiste du Hamel, secretary of the Acad\u00e9mie, he witnessed an unsuccessful blood transfusion effected by the Royal Society in hopes of curing a madman, with the thought that the human passions were transmitted in the blood./nThat same year he was commissioned with urbanization projects for the embellishment of Paris, notably the reconstruction of the Porte Saint-Denis and the Porte Saint-Bernard, and the plan for the city's expansion, which he accomplished with the collaboration of the architect Pierre Bullet./nOn 31 December 1671, the King named Blondel Director and Professor of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale d'Architecture./nIn 1673, Blondel was appointed professor of mathematics to the Grand Dauphin; if the royal pupil was of mediocre talent, the project resulted in Blondel's Cours de Math\u00e9matiques (1683)./nFrom 1670 until his death in 1686, Blondel was wholly occupied in professional matters and teaching.

Between 1773 and 1784 he was the engineer at the court of Emperor Joseph II. Having moved to Russia where Vatican law did not apply, he was welcomed at the Court of Catherine the Great as an engineer and saw there an opportunity to resume his monastic career among his exiled Jesuit brethren. He became the second Superior General of the Society of Jesus in Russia during the Holy See's suppression of the Society in Europe and its colonies and manifested great political skill in safeguarding the survival of the Jesuit order.[2][3]/nGabriel Gruber, born in Vienna to a Slovenian family. His father was an armourer by trade. In 1755 he entered the Society of Jesus, aged 15. His three younger brothers, Anton, Johann-Nepomuk and Tobias, also followed him into the Jesuits.[4]/nHis initial formation and studies took place in Austria, including Latin and Greek in Leoben (1757\u20131758), theology, philosophy and mathematics in Graz (1758\u201360), languages in Vienna (1760\u201361), mathematics at Trnava Jesuit university then in Hungary (1761\u201362), and again theology in Vienna (1763\u201367). In addition he undertook special studies in drawing, painting, music, mathematics, physics and medicine (specialising in surgery). During 1761-62 and 1762-63 he took up courses in astronomy and in civilian and military architecture.[1]/n1766, he was ordained priest in Graz.[5] During 1767-1768 while in Judenburg he completed his tertianship.[1]/nIn 1768, he moved to Ljubljana, where from 1769 he taught mathematics, mechanics, hydraulics and engineering at the School of Mechanical Engineering. The school taught courses in shipbuilding, port devices and structures, and it was Gruber's wish to build a dockyard nearby. That enterprise proved to be prohibitively expensive. In time Gruber became an expert in hydrotechnology and architecture, and had also a basic knowledge of navigation and the history of seamanship./nEarly in life, Gruber had been a fanatical builder of model ships. Some of the teaching materials at the School of Mechanical Engineering were naval models of his that were made at the school between 1774 and 1783, including a framework used during ship construction.[6][7]/nBetween 1772 and 1780, the construction of the Gruber Canal proceeded to his plans, in order to improve the outflow of water from the Ljubljana Marsh and thus to protect the city of Ljubljana from flooding. The works were carried out under his supervision until 1777, when he was replaced by Vincenzo Struppi, due to large increases in expenses and even doubts about his integrity. At the same time, he was the architect and builder of the Gruber Palace \u2014 a vast rococo edifice which was originally his mansion \u2014 used for his research in physics and hydraulics. It also had an astronomical observatory. In 1887 the palace was bought by the Carniolan Savings Bank and since 1965 it has housed the Slovenian archives./nFrom 1772 until 1781 Gruber was the director of the navigation department in Ljubljana, which took custody of the improvement of navigation on the Sava, the Kolpa and the Ljubljanica rivers. After the Suppression of the Society of Jesus by Pope Clement XIV, in 1773, Gruber remained as engineer at the court of Emperor Joseph II until 1784./nIn 1785, Gruber went to Polotsk, a border city between the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Russian Empire to rejoin the Society of Jesus and became a member of the Jesuit community in Russia. Gruber was an active engineer, chemist, architect, painter, mechanic and physicist. Under his influence, the Jesuit College in Polotsk became a famous academy of technical science. He was influential in the court of Catherine the Great, and was close to her son and successor Tsar Paul I, at whose request he reorganized the technical training in the whole Russian empire. In 1800 Gruber became the first rector of the Aristocratic College at the Saint Petersburg State University.[1]/nLiving in Saint Petersburg, and being a close confidant of Paul I of Russia, Gruber often discussed with him the affairs of his Society, on behalf of Franciszek Kareu, Vicar General of the Jesuits in Russia.[1] In 1797 he officially became the Assistant of Kareu and ultimately, after the death of the later, Gruber was elected Superior General of the Society of Jesus in Russia, at the Regional (Polotsk) Congregation IV of 1802. That was just a few months after Pius VII had issued the brief Catholicae fidei (1801), giving approval to the existence of the Russian Jesuits and making the Temporary Vicar (Franciszek Kareu) 'Superior General for Russia'.[1] Gruber expanded pioneering activities by opening several missions among the Germans in the Volga region (Saratov, 1803), Odessa (1804) and Astrakhan (1805) where schools and agricultural activities were developed. However, politically, problems were growing with Paul I as well as with the local bishop of Polotsk.[1]/nIn the meantime the movement towards reinstatement of the Jesuits was gaining momentum. In the wake of the French revolution the political opposition of the Bourbon courts had weakened against the Jesuits.

Contacts were established with the ex-Jesuits of Maryland (USA). In 1804, the existence of the Jesuits was officially recognized in Naples and Gruber became 'Superior General of the Society of Jesus in Russia and Naples'.[1] Plans were afoot to send an overland mission to China when Gruber died from smoke inhalation from an accidental fire at his Saint Petersburg residence on April 7, 1805.[1]", "61143617": "Anton Kazimirovich Sushkevich (\u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0421\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447) (23 January 1889, Borisoglebsk, Russia \u2014 30 August 1961, Kharkiv, Ukraine) was a Russian mathematician and textbook author who expanded group theory to include semigroups and other magmas./nSushkevich attended secondary school in Voronezh and studied in Berlin from 1906 to 1911.

The book studies a connection between Blaschke products, Poncelet's closure theorem, and the numerical range of matrices. A Blaschke product is a certain kind of mapping of the unit disk in the complex plane to itself, and the ones considered in the first part of the book have order three (they map the unit circle three-to-one to itself, so that each point on the unit circle has three preimages). These triples of preimages form triangles that are all inscribed in the unit circle, and (it turns out) they all circumscribe an ellipse. Thus, they form an infinite system of polygons inscribed in and circumscribing two conics, as Poncelet's theorem describes. The ellipse is the boundary of the numerical range of a certain matrix derived from the Blaschke product, a region within which the eigenvalues of the matrix can be found, and in this case the eigenvalues are at the foci of the ellipse. The book tells \"a story of discovery\" outlining these connections, extends similar results to Blaschke products of higher order, and outlines a plan for further research in this area.[4]/nGorkin was the 2018 AWM/MAA Falconer Lecturer.[5] Her lecture was on \"Finding Ellipses\", the topic of one of her books.

The determination of the parameters of sources is carried on by the direct solution of systems of high-order transcendental equations describing the response function of a multichannel analyzer.[3] In this case, the super-Rayleigh resolution of the sources of signals is ensured.[4] The difficulties arising at the solution of the transcendental systems of high-order equations were overcome by V.

He was one of the founders of singularity theory, and did foundational work in manifolds, embeddings, immersions, characteristic classes, and geometric integration theory./nHassler Whitney was born on March 23, 1907, in New York City, where his father, Edward Baldwin Whitney, was the First District New York Supreme Court judge.[1] His mother, A. Josepha Newcomb Whitney, was an artist and political activist.[2] He was the paternal nephew of Connecticut Governor and Chief Justice Simeon Eben Baldwin, his paternal grandfather was William Dwight Whitney, professor of Ancient Languages at Yale University, linguist and Sanskrit scholar.[2] Whitney was the great-grandson of Connecticut Governor and US Senator Roger Sherman Baldwin, and the great-great-grandson of American founding father Roger Sherman. His maternal grandparents were astronomer and mathematician Simon Newcomb (1835-1909), a Steeves descendant, and Mary Hassler Newcomb, granddaughter of the first superintendent of the Coast Survey Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler. His great uncle Josiah Whitney was the first to survey Mount Whitney.[3]/nHe married three times: his first wife was Margaret R. Howell, married on the 30 May 1930. They had three children, James Newcomb, Carol and Marian. After his first divorce, on January 16, 1955 he married Mary Barnett Garfield. He and Mary had two daughters, Sarah Newcomb and Emily Baldwin. Finally, Whitney divorced his second wife and married Barbara Floyd Osterman on 8 February 1986./nWhitney and his first wife Margaret made an innovative decision in 1939 that influenced the history of modern architecture in New England, when they commissioned the architect Edwin B. Goodell, Jr. to design a new residence for their family in Weston, Massachusetts. They purchased a rocky hillside site on a historic road, next door to another International Style house by Goodell from several years earlier, designed for Richard and Caroline Field./nDistinctively featuring flat roofs, flush wood siding, and corner windows\u2014all of which were unusual architectural elements at the time\u2014the Whitney House was also a creative response to its site, in that it placed the main living spaces one floor above ground level, with large banks of windows opening to the south sun and to views of the beautiful property. The Whitney House survives today, along with the Field House, more than 75 years following its original construction; both are contributing structures in the historic Sudbury Road Area./nThroughout his life he pursued two particular hobbies with excitement: music and mountain-climbing. An accomplished player of the violin and the viola, Whitney played with the Princeton Musical Amateurs. He would run outside, 6 to 12 miles every other day. As an undergraduate, with his cousin Bradley Gilman, Whitney made the first ascent of the Whitney\u2013Gilman ridge on Cannon Mountain, New Hampshire in 1929. It was the hardest and most famous rock climb in the East. He was a member of the Swiss Alpine Society and the Yale Mountaineering Society (the precursor to the Yale Outdoors Club) and climbed most of the mountain peaks in Switzerland.[4]/nThree years after his third marriage, on 10 May 1989, Whitney died in Princeton,[5] after suffering a stroke.[6] In accordance with his wish, Hassler Whitney's ashes rest atop mountain Dents Blanches in Switzerland where Oscar Burlet, another mathematician and member of the Swiss Alpine Club, placed them on August 20, 1989.[7]/nWhitney attended Yale University, where he received baccalaureate degrees in physics and in music, respectively in 1928 and in 1929.[2] Later, in 1932, he earned a PhD in mathematics at Harvard University.[2] His doctoral dissertation was The Coloring of Graphs, written under the supervision of George David Birkhoff.[8][9]\nAt Harvard, Birkhoff also got him a job as Instructor of Mathematics for the years 1930\u201331,[10] and an Assistant Professorship for the years 1934\u201335.[11] Later on he held the following working positions: NRC Fellow, Mathematics, 1931\u201333; Assistant Professor, 1935\u201340; Associate Professor, 1940\u201346, Professor, 1946\u201352; Professor Instructor, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton University, 1952\u201377; Professor Emeritus, 1977\u201389; Chairman of the Mathematics Panel, National Science Foundation, 1953\u201356; Exchange Professor, Coll\u00e8ge de France, 1957; Memorial Committee, Support of Research in Mathematical Sciences, National Research Council, 1966\u201367; President, International Commission of Mathematical Instruction, 1979\u201382; Research Mathematician, National Defense Research Committee, 1943\u201345; Construction of the School of Mathematics./nHe was a member of the National Academy of Sciences; Colloquium Lecturer, American Mathematical Society, 1946; Vice President, 1948\u201350 and Editor, American Journal of Mathematics, 1944\u201349; Editor, Mathematical Reviews, 1949\u201354; Chairman of the Committee vis. lectureship, 1946\u201351; Committee Summer Instructor, 1953\u201354;, American Mathematical Society; American National Council Teachers of Mathematics, London Mathematical Society (Honorary), Swiss Mathematics Society (Honorary), Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences de Paris (Foreign Associate); New York Academy of Sciences./nIn 1947 he was elected member of the American Philosophical Society.[12]\nIn 1969 he was awarded the Lester R. Ford Award for the paper in two parts \"The mathematics of Physical quantities\" (1968a, 1968b).[13] In 1976 he was awarded the National Medal of Science. In 1980 he was elected honorary member of the London Mathematical Society.[14] In 1982, he received the Wolf Prize from the Wolf Foundation, and finally, in 1985, he was awarded the Steele Prize from the American Mathematical Society./nWhitney's earliest work, from 1930 to 1933, was on graph theory.  Many of his contributions were to the graph-coloring, and the ultimate computer-assisted solution to the four-color problem relied on some of his results. His work in graph theory culminated in a 1933 paper,[15] where he laid the foundations for matroids, a fundamental notion in modern combinatorics and representation theory independently introduced by him and Bartel Leendert van der Waerden in the mid 1930s.[16] In this paper Whitney proved several theorems about the matroid of a graph M(G): one such theorem, now called Whitney's 2-Isomorphism Theorem, states: Given G and H are graphs with no isolated vertices. Then M(G) and M(H) are isomorphic if and only if G and H are 2-isomorphic.[17]/nWhitney's lifelong interest in geometric properties of functions also began around this time.  His earliest work in this subject was on the possibility of extending a function defined on a closed subset of \u211dn to a function on all of \u211dn with certain smoothness properties. A complete solution to this problem was found only in 2005 by Charles Fefferman./nIn a 1936 paper, Whitney gave a definition of a smooth manifold of class C r, and proved that, for high enough values of r, a smooth manifold of dimension n may be embedded in \u211d2n+1, and immersed in \u211d2n.  (In 1944 he managed to reduce the dimension of the ambient space by 1, provided that n > 2, by a technique that has come to be known as the \"Whitney trick\".) This basic result shows that manifolds may be treated intrinsically or extrinsically, as we wish. The intrinsic definition had been published only a few years earlier in the work of Oswald Veblen and J. H. C. Whitehead. These theorems opened the way for much more refined studies of embedding, immersion and also of smoothing\u2014that is, the possibility of having various smooth structures on a given topological manifold./nHe was one of the major developers of cohomology theory, and characteristic classes, as these concepts emerged in the late 1930s, and his work on algebraic topology continued into the 40s. He also returned to the study of functions in the 1940s, continuing his work on the extension problems formulated a decade earlier, and answering a question of Laurent Schwartz in a 1948 paper On Ideals of Differentiable Functions./nWhitney had, throughout the 1950s, an almost unique interest in the topology of singular spaces and in singularities of smooth maps. An old idea, implicit even in the notion of a simplicial complex, was to study a singular space by decomposing it into smooth pieces (nowadays called \"strata\"). Whitney was the first to see  any subtlety in this definition, and pointed out that a good \"stratification\" should satisfy conditions he termed \"A\" and \"B\", now referred to as Whitney conditions. The work of Ren\u00e9 Thom and John Mather in the 1960s showed that these conditions give a very robust definition of stratified space.\nThe singularities in low dimension of smooth mappings, later to come to prominence in the work of Ren\u00e9 Thom, were also first studied by Whitney./nIn his book Geometric Integration Theory he gives a theoretical basis for Stokes' theorem applied with singularities on the boundary:[18]. Later, his work on such topics inspired the researches of Jenny Harrison.[19]/nThese aspects of Whitney's work have looked more unified, in retrospect and with the general development of singularity theory. Whitney's purely topological work (Stiefel\u2013Whitney class, basic results on vector bundles) entered the mainstream more quickly./nIn 1967, he became involved full-time in educational problems, especially at the elementary school level.\nHe spent many years in classrooms, both teaching mathematics and observing how it is taught.[20] He spent four months teaching pre-algebra mathematics to a classroom of seventh graders and conducted summer courses for teachers. He traveled widely to lecture on the subject in the United States and abroad. He worked toward removing mathematical anxiety, which he felt leads young pupils to avoid mathematics. Whitney spread the ideas of teaching mathematics to students in ways that relate the content to their own lives as opposed to teaching them rote memorization./nHassler Whitney published 82 works:[21] all his published articles, included the ones listed in this section and the preface of the book Whitney (1957), are collected in the two volumes Whitney (1992a, pp.\u00a0xii\u2013xiv) and Whitney (1992b, pp.\u00a0xii\u2013xiv).", "57440883": "Herbert Fleischner (born 29 January 1944 in London) is an Austrian mathematician./nFleischner moved to Vienna with his parents in 1946.

His father retained custody of the children and it was only a short while before her death in 1935, that Adams saw his mother again./nThe father married again \u2013 a young German woman, who created for George and his siblings a happy childhood. Educated by English governesses, he was raised to fluency in several languages, primarily English, German and Polish. From 1905, Adams attended Mill Hill School in England, travelling home alone to his family in Galicia. In 1912 he entered Christ's College, Cambridge to read Chemistry, completing his BA in 1915. He was president of Cambridge University Socialist Society in 1915./nPreoccupied with problems of social reform, he rejected all manner of violence, remaining a conscientious objector throughout the First World War \u2013 a \"militant revolutionary\" as he described himself. He was imprisoned after refusing to serve with other conscientious objectors in the Non-Combatant Corps and was only released in 1919, after a hunger strike. The atomistic and materialistic thoughts of his time failed to satisfy him, causing him to seek for alternatives in the work of Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell. On questioning Russell on how to reach satisfactory conclusions in theoretical physics without the hypothesis of the atom, Russell encouraged him to study projective geometry. Following this advice, Adams began to concern himself primarily with mathematics and theoretical physics. He heard lectures by G. H. Hardy and began to research projective, non-Euclidean geometry./nIn 1914 he had encountered Rudolf Steiner\u2019s \"Occult Science\" and become a member of the Emerson Group in London in 1916. During his time as conscientious objector he had come to know Mary Fox, a Quaker and in 1920 they married./nHis interest in Steiner's ideas on social reform and his intention to translate the book The Threefold Social Order (GA 23) caused him to visit Steiner together with Ethel Bowen Wedgwood in Dornach, Switzerland. Steiner advised him to become involved in some form of social work, something Adams could readily accept amid the social collapse in Central and Eastern Europe following the war. He went on several journeys to Poland as part of the English and American Quaker organisation./nIn 1920 he took part in the inauguration of the first Goetheanum building. On his return to England, he cooperated with some friends on spreading the ideas of Social threefolding as well as the anthroposophical ideas of Steiner. His wife Mary Adams began her work as librarian and translator for the Anthroposophical Society in London that she was to carry for many years. In addition, Adams was the free verbal translator of around 110 lectures of Steiner into English.[2] He went on to translate many of Steiner's written works, often with Mary Adams./nHe was often in Dornach during these times and experienced the burning of the first Goetheanum on New Year's Eve 1922/23 and was part of the Christmas Foundation meeting of the General Anthroposophical Society in 1923/24. In 1924 he became one of the Goetheanum-Speakers authorised by Steiner./nWhile working as a free co-worker of the Anthroposophical Society in Britain as lecturer and workshop holder after 1925, Adams turned again to the study of the natural sciences and mathematics, concentrating particularly on projective geometry and working with Elisabeth Vreede, leader of the Section for Mathematics and Astronomy at the Goetheanum. At the beginning of the 1930s, Adams published a series of articles and essays about projective, synthetic geometry and its relationship to physics, to Goethe's theory of metamorphosis and to anthroposophical spiritual science, particularly the pioneering work \"Of Etheric Space\" in the magazine Natura of the Goetheanum's Medical Section. Here for the first time is mentioned the concept of \"counter-space\", as Steiner indicated in the third of his courses on the Natural Sciences (GA 323), explained by means of non-Euclidean geometry. Some years later Louis Locher was to discover the same thing independently of Adams. From that time on the conceptual development of the idea of counter-space in its relation to normal spatial thinking became the focal point of Adams' further scientific research. In 1933 the comprehensive work Space and the Light of the Creation \u2013 Synthetic Geometry in the light of Spiritual Science appeared, which was an overview of the spiritual scientific meaning of synthetic geometry./nWhen Elisabeth Vreede and Ita Wegman were dismissed from the executive of the General Anthroposophical Society in Dornach, a number of other prominent members of the German, Dutch and British Societies were expelled, including Adams. This brought to an end his cooperation with the Mathematical/Astronomical Section. When the Chairman of the Anthroposophical Society in Great Britain, D. N. Dunlop, died in May 1935, Adams took over as general secretary. In this task, Olive Whicher became his closest co-worker, and he introduced her to projective geometry./nAt the outbreak of the Second World War, Adams volunteered as interpreter in a prisoner of war camp. His close ties to Germany were soon the subject of investigation and he was dismissed after six months. He changed his name at this point from George Kaufmann to George Adams, taking the maiden name of his mother. In the following years Adams was one of the monitors of the Polish broadcasting corporation in the service of the BBC and he learnt several additional Slavic languages. Much of his free time was spent in the British Library studying the development of modern mathematical sciences to augment them with his thoughts about counter-space./nAfter the war, he was given a scholarship by the British Anthroposophical Society at Rudolf Steiner House to investigate with Whicher the geometric principles underlying the world of plants. It had been unclear where the corresponding projective counterpart of the infinite plane of Euclidean space, the infinite midpoint of the non-Euclidean space (called by Locher the \"absolute midpoint\") was to be found in the plant world. In 1947, Adams expressed the idea that such a midpoint did not just exist, but that there was one to be found in every bud. This idea was connected with that of the lemniscatory correlation between space and counter-space and further researched by Whicher and himself. In 1949 and 1952, two books appeared with the titles: The Living Plant and the Science of Physical and Ethereal Space and The Plant between Sun and Earth./nIn 1947, at the request of his friends Fried Geuter and Michael Wilson of Sunfield Homes in Clent near Birmingham, Whicher and he moved to Clent, where they founded the Goethean science Foundation with Wilson to undertake scientific research. The peaceful countryside and a secure financial base provided an ideal environment for the work that followed./nShortly before this, in 1946, Adams had made contact with the Goetheanum and its Mathematical-Astronomical Section under the provisional guidance of Louis Locher. He wished, despite their differences, to work together on common issues. He again participated actively in many conferences and discussions at the Goetheanum and in Germany. He also took up contact again with Georg Unger, who went on to found the Mathematisch-Physicalisches Institut in 1956, where Adams reported regularly on his work. Unger visited Clent for common research gatherings./nAdams began his research on rigid body statics and dynamics in mechanics from the point of view of space and counter-space on the basis of projective linear geometry. The results were published in the late 1950s in the magazine Mathematisch-Physikalische Korrespondenz edited by Unger and appeared in book form in 1996. Based on the groundwork done by a number of mathematicians like Felix Klein, Arthur Cayley, William K. Clifford and Eduard Study, Adams pursued the idea of counter-space into the concrete details of rigid body statics and dynamics (in non-Euclidean spaces). Peter Gschwind was to build on this research and lead it into the sphere of Quantum physics./nAdams and Unger also began to collaborate with Alexandre Leroi and Theodor Schwenk, leading to the establishment of the Instituts f\u00fcr Str\u00f6mungsforschung in Herrischried in the Black Forest. During the last years of his life, Adams expended a lot of his energy on this project, desiring to test the efficacy of his ideas on space and counter-space into the realm of technology. He worked out specific planes (W-planes) and with John Wilkes built models for the self-purification and re-enlivening of water through special forms. He often worked in Herrischried with Whicher, following with interest the research of Leroi and Schwenk./nAfter a light stroke in August 1959, Adams divided his time between the Black Forest and England devoting much time to the translation of works of Steiner./nHe is reported to have combined several polarities in character: on the one hand multilingual and worldly, he tended on the other to be shy and strangely innocent; a clear thinker schooled in mathematics, chemistry and physics, his relationship to nature was rather more introspective and religious; he allowed himself to be incarcerated for his convictions, while in his relationships he showed extreme modesty, humour and never allowed his knowledge to become overbearing.", "8616579": "Henri Claudius Rosarius  Dulac (3 October 1870, Fayence \u2013 2 September 1955, Fayence) was a French mathematician./nBorn in Fayence, France, Dulac graduated from \u00c9cole Polytechnique (Paris, class of 1892) and obtained a Doctorate in Mathematics.

He was born between 1554-1575[2] in Algiers in Ottoman Algeria and died around 1611, during the rule of Murad III.[3]/nHis most important work was Tuhfat al-a'dad fi-l-hisab (The Ornament of Numbers), which discusses some form of the concept of the logarithm.[4]/nIbn Hamza was born in Algiers during the 16th century to an Algerian father and a Turkish mother. He studied and memorized in his youth the Quran and a large part of the hadiths, while showing great talents in mathematics. When he reached the age of twenty, his father decided to send him to Istanbul to his maternal family to study mathematics with scholars in the capital of the Ottoman Empire. He thus spent part of his life in Istanbul during the reign of the Ottoman caliph Mourad III, where he quickly became one of the experts in the accounts of the Ottoman Diwan.[5] His dual command of the Arabic and Ottoman Turkish languages also enabled him to teach children of Istanbul schools./nIbn Hamza remained in Istanbul until the death of his father, when he resigned from his post to return to Algiers in order to take care of his widowed mother. Once in Algeria, Ibn Hamza worked in his father's stalls for some time before deciding to resell them all as well as the family house to move with his mother to Mecca to make his Hajj pilgrimage and subsequently settle in the city.[5]/nIn Mecca, Ibn Hamza stood out for the mathematics lessons he provided to pilgrims. At that time, Ibn Hamzah mainly focused on teaching mathematical problems and tools that can serve pilgrims on a daily basis, including mathematical problems and games that revolve around questions of heritage. During his stay in Mecca, during the Hijri year 999 (1591), his main work, a 512-page treatise on mathematics entitled Tohfat al-a'dad li-dwi al-rusd we-al-sedad (literally in Arabic: The treasury of numbers for those with reason and common sense) and written mainly in Ottoman Turkish (despite a title in Arabic). Ibn Hamza refers at the beginning of his book to the mathematical treatise \"Al-ma'\u00fbna\" by Ibn al-H\u00e2'im (1352-1412),[6] he also thanks and cites many authors in his work, including Sinan bin Al-Fath, Ibn Yunus, Abu Abdullah bin Ghazi Al-Mankisi Al-Maghribi, Al-Kashi, Naseeruddin Al-Tusi, Al-Nasawi and many other mathematicians. [5]/nWhen the Ottoman governor learned of the various works of Ibn Hazam in Mecca, he offered him to work in Diwan Al-Mal, a position he would hold for about fifteen years. He died around 1611.[7]/nIt is possible that Ibn Hamza's work had some success and circulated as far as Egypt, where two copies are still preserved in Cairo today. However, the fact that he writes his work in Turkish and not in Arabic means that the latter quickly fell into oblivion before being rediscovered by the Turkish epistemologist and mathematician S\u00e2lih Zek\u00ee, in 1888 by chance when the latter bought from a Istanbul Grand Bazaar bookseller an old copy of Ibn Hamza's manuscript.[6][8] S\u00e2lih Zek\u00ee first disseminates the hypothesis of the discovery of logarithms by Ibn Hazam by analyzing his copy of Ibn Hamza.[6]/nAccording to a historiographical tradition widespread in the Arab world, his work would have led to the discovery of the logarithm function around 1591; 23 years before the Scottish John Napier, notoriously known to be the inventor of the function of the natural logarithm. This hypothesis is based initially on the interpretation of S\u00e2lih Zek\u00ee of the handwritten copy of the work of Ibn Hamza, interpreted a posteriori in the Arab and Ottoman world as laying the foundations of the logarithmic function. Zek\u00ee published in 1913, a two-volume work on the history of mathematical sciences, written in Ottoman Turkish: \u00c2s\u00e2r-\u0131 B\u00e2kiye (literally in Turkish: The memories that remain). where his observations on Ibn Hamza's role in the invention of logarithms appear.[6]/nIndeed, in his work, Ibn Hamza establishes a correlation between numbers in geometric progression and numbers in arithmetic progression, a correlation which would be a clue to think that he would have probably understood the notion of logarithm. These few lines on Ibn Hamza will quickly find an important distribution in particular in the work Science among the Ottoman Turks of Abd\u00fclhak Adnan Ad\u0131var which affirms that, if Ibn Hamza had started the study of the progression by the 0 instead of 1, he could have managed to invent logarithms./nIn the Arab world, Qadr\u00ee H\u00e2fidh T\u00fbq\u00e2n (1911-1971), professor of mathematics and Palestinian politician, published a book Tur\u00e2th al-'arab al-'ilm\u00ee f\u00ee al-riy\u00e2diyy\u00e2twa al-falak (in Arabic: The scientific heritage of the Arabs in mathematics and astronomy), a work published in an Arab nationalist framework. He takes up the Turkish theses of a conceptualization of logarithms by Ibn Hamza. George Sarton, reading this work, writes that \"the idea of comparing and juxtaposing arithmetic and geometric progressions had occurred to many Western minds, (but) that from this comparison to logarithms there was still a very large ditch (it seems small to us who know logarithms, but was very large for those who had yet to invent them) \u201d./nIt is nevertheless useful to underline that the majority of the commentators of this controversy (Tuq\u00e2n, Sarton, Hartner ...) did not however have access to the initial text of Ibn Hamza, which does not prevent these analyzes of texts and these second-hand observations to experience an accelerated dissemination in books and encyclopedias in recent years.[9]/nPierre Ageron, studying superficially8 a copy of Ibn Hamza's manuscript in Ottoman Turkish, kept at the S\u00fcleymaniye K\u00fct\u00fcphanesi library, and dated to the Hijri year 1013, highlights an example linking geometric progression and arithmetic progression: the first written in oriental Arabic numerals (\u06f1 \u06f2 \u0664 \u06f8 \u06f1\u0666 \u06f3\u06f2 \u0666\u0664 \u06f1\u06f2\u06f8), and the second in alphabetical numbers (\u0627 \u0628 \u062c \u062f \u0647 \u0648 \u0632 \u062d). In the margin is a figure which gives two graduations of the same segment: a regular one above, and a \"logarithmic\" graduation below. But, for the latter, the use of alphabetic and therefore whole numbers suggests that Ibn Hamza did not think of inserting non-integers and no approximate logarithm calculation is recorded in the manuscript9. Nevertheless we can note that, in the text in Ottoman Turkish, where Pierre Agero identifies the Arabic words us (exponent), dil'ayn (two sides) and a series of powers of 2 in oriental Arabic numerals and that of the corresponding exponents in numerals alphabetic, he was unable to read the actual text of the book because he did not master Ottoman Turkish./n\u201c A father dies leaving eighty-one palm trees to his nine sons.

He is notable for early research[1] into the theory of functions of a complex variable, for the evaluation of several important logarithmic integrals and series, for his studies in the theory of Zeta-function related series and integrals, as well as for helping Mittag-Leffler start the journal Acta Mathematica.[2]\nMalmsten became Docent in 1840, and then, Professor of mathematics at the Uppsala University in 1842. He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1844. He was also a minister without portfolio in 1859\u20131866 and Governor of Skaraborg County in 1866\u20131879./nUsually, Malmsten is known for his earlier works in complex analysis.[1] However, he also greatly contributed in other branches of mathematics, but his results were undeservedly forgotten and many of them were erroneously attributed to other persons. Thus, it was comparatively recently that it was discovered by Iaroslav Blagouchine[3]\nthat Malmsten was first who evaluated several important logarithmic integrals and series, which are closely related to the gamma- and zeta-functions, and among which we can find the so-called Vardi's integral and the Kummer's series for the logarithm of the Gamma function. In particular, in 1842 he evaluated following lnln-logarithmic integrals./nThe details and an interesting historical analysis are given in Blagouchine's paper.[3]\nMany of these integrals were later rediscovered by various researchers, including Vardi,[4]\nAdamchik,[5]\nMedina[6]\nand Moll.[7]\nMoreover, some authors even named the first of these integrals after Vardi, who re-evaluated it in 1988 (they call it Vardi's integral), and so did many well-known internet resources such as Wolfram MathWorld site[8]\nor OEIS Foundation site[9]\n(taking into account the undoubted Malmsten priority in the evaluation of such a kind of logarithmic integrals, it seems that the name Malmsten's integrals would be more appropriate for them[3]).\nMalmsten derived the above formulae by making use of different series representations. At the same time, it has been shown that they can be also evaluated by methods of contour integration,[3] by making use of the Hurwitz Zeta function,[5] by employing polylogarithms[6] and by using L-functions.[4] More complicated forms of Malmsten's integrals appear in works of Adamchik[5] and Blagouchine[3] (more than 70 integrals). Below are several examples of such integrals/nwhere m and n are positive integers such that m<n, G is Catalan's constant, \u03b6 stands for the Riemann zeta-function, \u03a8 is the digamma function, and \u03a81 is the trigamma function; see respectively eq. (43), (47) and (48) in Adamchik[5] for the first three integrals, and exercises no. 36-a, 36-b, 11-b and 13-b in Blagouchine[3] for the last four integrals respectively (the third integral being calculated in both works). It is curious that some of Malmsten's integrals lead to the gamma- and polygamma functions of a complex argument, which are not often encountered in analysis. For instance, as shown by Iaroslav Blagouchine,[3]/nor,/nsee exercises 7-\u0430 and 37 respectively. By the way, Malmsten's integrals are also found to be closely connected to the Stieltjes constants.[3][10]/nIn 1842, Malmsten also evaluated several important logarithmic series, among which we can find these two series/nand/nThe latter series was later rediscovered in a slightly different form by Ernst Kummer, who derived a similar expression/nin 1847[3] (strictly speaking, the Kummer's result is obtained from the Malmsten's one by putting a=\u03c0(2x-1)). Moreover, this series is even known in analysis as Kummer's series for the logarithm of the Gamma function, although Malmsten derived it 5 years before Kummer./nMalsmten also notably contributed into the theory of zeta-function related series and integrals. In 1842 he proved following important functional relationship for the L-function/nas well as for the M-function/nwhere in both formulae 0<s<1. First of these formulae was proposed by Leonhard Euler already in 1749,[11] but it was Malmsten who proved it (Euler only suggested this formula and verified it for several integer and semi-integer values of s). Curiously enough, the same formula for L(s) was unconsciously rediscovered by Oscar Schl\u00f6milch in 1849 (proof provided only in 1858).[3][12][13][14] Four years later, Malmsten derived several other similar reflection formulae, which turn out to be particular cases of the Hurwitz's functional equation./nSpeaking about the Malmsten's contribution into the theory of zeta-functions, we can not fail to mention the very recent discovery of his authorship of the reflection formula for the first generalized Stieltjes constant at rational argument/nwhere m and n are positive integers such that m<n.\nThis identity was derived, albeit in a slightly different form, by Malmsten already in 1846 and has been also discovered independently several times by various authors. In particular, in the literature devoted to Stieltjes constants, it is often attributed to Almkvist and Meurman who derived it in 1990s.[10]", "3996306": "William Leonard Edge FRSE (8 November 1904 \u2013 27 September 1997) was a British mathematician most known for his work in finite geometry.

He was well-versed in calligraphy, music, mathematics and astronomy. One of his daughters, Cai Yan / Cai Wenji, was also a famous poet and musician./nCai Yong was born in a substantial local family in Yu County (\u5709\u7e23), Chenliu Commandery (\u9673\u7559\u90e1), which is around present-day Qi County, Kaifeng, Henan. The Cai family had a reputation of not having their territory divided for three generations. When his father Cai Leng (\u8521\u68f1) died, Cai Yong lived with his uncle Cai Zhi (\u8521\u8cea) while taking great care for his own mother for her last three years. When she died, Cai Yong became known for his arrangement of his mother's tomb. After that, Cai Yong studied composition, mathematics, astronomy, pitch-pipes and music under Hu Guang (\u80e1\u5ee3), one of the highest-ranking officials in the Han imperial court./nIn the early 160s, Cai Yong was recommended to Emperor Huan (r.\u2009 146\u2013168) by the senior eunuchs for his skill with the drums and the guqin. On his way to the capital, Cai Yong feigned illness to return home to study in seclusion. Ten years later in the early 170s, Cai Yong served as a clerk under the official Qiao Xuan, who greatly admired his abilities. Afterwards, Cai Yong served as a county magistrate and then a Consultant in the capital, in charge of editing and collating the text in the library. Known for his literary skills, he was constantly commissioned to write eulogies, memorial inscriptions, and the like./nIn 175, in fear of parties trying to alter the Confucian classics to support their views, Cai Yong and a group of scholars petitioned to have the Five Classics engraved in stone. Emperor Ling (r.\u2009 168\u2013189) approved, and the result was the Xiping Stone Classics (\u71b9\u5e73\u77f3\u7d93), completed in 183, which set the canon for future generations of scholars./nThroughout his political career, he was an advocate of restoring ceremonial practices and often criticised against the eunuchs' influence in politics. He was successful in persuading the emperor to participate in a ritual in the winter of 177 through his memorials, but his attacks on the eunuchs were not so successful./nIn the autumn of 178, the scholars were asked for advice on recent ill omens. Cai Yong responded with criticisms of eunuch pretensions. The eunuchs learnt of the attack, and accused Cai Yong and his uncle Cai Zhi of extortion. They were thrown into prison and sentenced to death, but the sentence was later remitted to exile in the northern frontiers. Nine months later, he cited to the throne that his work on the dynastic history and classics were at risk from enemy raids, and was allowed back to the capital. However, he offended the sibling of an influential eunuch during a farewell banquet before his return, which put his position in the capital at risk. Cai Yong fled south to Wu (\u5433) and Kuaiji commanderies and stayed there for 12 years./nWhen the warlord Dong Zhuo came to power in 189 and controlled the central government, he summoned Cai Yong back to the imperial capital Luoyang. At first Cai Yong was unwilling, but Dong Zhuo enforced his demand with the threat \"I can eliminate whole clans\", Cai Yong had no choice but to comply. Under Dong Zhuo, Cai Yong was appointed Left General of the Household, and became in charge of revising rituals for Dong Zhuo's new government. Despite Dong Zhuo's admiration of Cai Yong as a scholar and musician, Cai Yong worried about Dong Zhuo's temper and once considered to return home, but was persuaded that he was too well known to escape./nIn May 192, when Dong Zhuo was killed in a plot by Wang Yun, Cai Yong was put into prison and sentenced to death for allegedly expressing grief at Dong Zhuo's death. Cai Yong and other government officials pleaded with Wang Yun to allow him to finish his work on the history of Han, but Wang Yun denied them, saying:/n\"In ancient times, Emperor Wu failed to kill Sima Qian, and so allowed him to write a book of slander which was passed down to later times. Particularly at this time, as the fortunes of the Emperor are in decline and there are war-horses in the suburbs, we cannot allow a treacherous minister to hold his brush among the attendants to a young emperor. It offers no advantage to the sage virtue of the ruler, and it will cause our party to suffer contempt and abuse.\"/nIt was said that Wang Yun eventually regretted this decision, but Cai Yong had already died in prison. After his death, pictures were set up in his honour, and commemorative eulogies were composed throughout Chenliu Commandery and Yan Province./nDue to the turmoil in China in the decade after Cai Yong's death, many of his works were lost.

He pioneered small sample experimental design and analysis with an economic approach to the logic of uncertainty. Gosset published under the pen name Student and developed most famously Student's t-distribution \u2013 originally called Student's \"z\" \u2013 and \"Student's test of statistical significance\".[1]/nBorn in Canterbury, England the eldest son of Agnes Sealy Vidal and Colonel Frederic Gosset, R.E. Royal Engineers, Gosset attended Winchester College before matriculating as Winchester Scholar in natural sciences and mathematics at New College, Oxford. Upon graduating in 1899, he joined the brewery of Arthur Guinness & Son in Dublin, Ireland; he spent the rest of his 38-year career at Guinness.[1][2]/nGosset had three children with Marjory Gosset (n\u00e9e Phillpotts). Harry Gosset (1907\u20131965) was a consultant paediatrician; Bertha Marian Gosset (1909\u20132004) was a geographer and nurse; the youngest, Ruth Gosset (1911\u20131953) married the Oxford mathematician Douglas Roaf and had five children./nIn his job as Head Experimental Brewer at Guinness, the self-trained Gosset developed new statistical methods \u2013 both in the brewery and on the farm \u2013 now central to the design of experiments, to proper use of significance testing on repeated trials, and to analysis of economic significance (an early instance of decision theory interpretation of statistics) and more, such as his small-sample, stratified, and repeated balanced experiments on barley for proving the best yielding varieties.[3] Gosset acquired that knowledge by study, by trial and error, by cooperating with others, and by spending two terms in 1906\u20131907 in the Biometrics laboratory of Karl Pearson.[4] Gosset and Pearson had a good relationship.[4] Pearson helped Gosset with the mathematics of his papers, including the 1908 papers, but had little appreciation of their importance. The papers addressed the brewer's concern with small samples; biometricians like Pearson, on the other hand, typically had hundreds of observations and saw no urgency in developing small-sample methods.[2]/nGosset's first publication came in 1907, \"On the Error of Counting with a Haemacytometer,\" in which \u2013 unbeknownst to Gosset aka \"Student\" \u2013 he rediscovered the Poisson distribution.[3] Another researcher at Guinness had previously published a paper containing trade secrets of the Guinness brewery. The economic historian Stephen Ziliak discovered in the Guinness Archives that to prevent further disclosure of confidential information, the Guinness Board of Directors allowed its scientists to publish research on condition that they do not mention \"1) beer, 2) Guinness, or 3) their own surname\".[4] To Ziliak, Gosset seems to have gotten his pen name \"Student\" from his 1906\u20131907 notebook on counting yeast cells with a haemacytometer, \"The Student's Science Notebook\"[1][5] Thus his most noteworthy achievement is now called Student's, rather than Gosset's, t-distribution and test of statistical significance.[2]/nGosset published most of his 21 academic papers, including The probable error of a mean, in Pearson's journal Biometrika under the pseudonym Student.[6] It was, however, not Pearson but Ronald A. Fisher who appreciated the understudied importance of Gosset's small-sample work. Fisher wrote to Gosset in 1912 explaining that Student's z-distribution should be divided by degrees of freedom not total sample size. From 1912 to 1934 Gosset and Fisher would exchange more than 150 letters. In 1924, Gosset wrote in a letter to Fisher, \"I am sending you a copy of Student's Tables as you are the only man that's ever likely to use them!\" Fisher believed that Gosset had effected a \"logical revolution\".[3] In a special issue of Metron in 1925 Student published the corrected tables, now called Student's t \n\n\n\nz\n=\n\n\nt\n\nn\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\textstyle z={\\frac {t}{\\sqrt {n-1}}}}\n\n. In the same volume Fisher contributed applications of Student's t-distribution to regression analysis.[3]/nAlthough introduced by others, Studentized residuals are named in Student's honour because, like the problem that led to Student's t-distribution, the idea of adjusting for estimated standard deviations is central to that concept.[7]/nGosset's interest in the cultivation of barley led him to speculate that the design of experiments should aim not only at improving the average yield but also at breeding varieties whose yield was insensitive to variation in soil and climate (that is, \"robust\"). Gosset called his innovation \"balanced layout\", because treatments and controls are allocated in a balanced fashion to stratified growing conditions, such as differential soil fertility.[8] Gosset's balanced principle was challenged by Ronald Fisher, who preferred randomized designs. The Bayesian Harold Jeffreys, and Gosset's close associates Jerzy Neyman and Egon S. Pearson sided with Gosset's balanced designs of experiments; however, as Ziliak (2014) has shown, Gosset and Fisher would strongly disagree for the rest of their lives about the meaning and interpretation of balanced versus randomized experiments, as they had earlier clashed on the role of bright-line rules of statistical significance.[4]/nIn 1935, at the age of 59, Gosset left Dublin to take up the position of Head Brewer at a new (and second) Guinness brewery at Park Royal in northwestern London. In September 1937 Gosset was promoted to Head Brewer of all Guinness. He died one month later, aged 61, in Beaconsfield, England, of a heart attack.[1]/nGosset was a friend of both Pearson and Fisher, a noteworthy achievement, for each had a massive ego and a loathing for the other. He was a modest man who once cut short an admirer with this comment: \"Fisher would have discovered it all anyway.\"[9]/nGosset:", "391905": "Shiing-Shen Chern (/t\u0283\u025c\u02d0rn/; Chinese: \u9673\u7701\u8eab; pinyin: Ch\u00e9n X\u01d0ngsh\u0113n, Mandarin: [t\u0282\u02b0\u0259n.\u0255i\u014b.\u0282\u0259n]; October 28, 1911 \u2013 December 3, 2004) was a Chinese-American mathematician and poet. He made fundamental contributions to differential geometry and topology. He has been called the \"father of modern differential geometry\" and is widely regarded as a leader in geometry and one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century, winning numerous awards and recognition including the Wolf Prize and the inaugural Shaw Prize.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7] In memory of Shiing-Shen Chern, the International Mathematical Union established the Chern Medal in 2010 to recognize \"an individual whose accomplishments warrant the highest level of recognition for outstanding achievements in the field of mathematics\".[8]/nChern worked at the Institute for Advanced Study (1943\u201345), spent about a decade at the University of Chicago (1949-1960), and then moved to University of California, Berkeley, where he co-founded the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in 1982 and was the institute's founding director.[9][10] Renowned co-authors with Chern include Jim Simons, an American mathematician and billionaire hedge fund manager.[11] Chern's work, most notably the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet Theorem, Chern\u2013Simons theory, and Chern classes, are still highly influential in current research in mathematics, including geometry, topology, and knot theory; as well as many branches of physics, including string theory, condensed matter physics, general relativity, and quantum field theory.[12]/nChern's surname (\u9648) is a common Chinese surname which is now usually spelled Chen. The unusual spelling \"Chern\" is from the old Gwoyeu Romatzyh (GR) romanization that uses spelling to indicate tones. equivalent pinyin would be \"Ch\u00e9n X\u01d0ngsh\u0113n\". In English, Chern pronounced his own name as \"Churn\" (/t\u0283\u025c\u02d0rn/), and this spelling pronunciation is now widely used among English-speaking mathematicians and physicists./nChern was born in Xiushui, Jiaxing, China in 1911. He graduated from Xiushui Middle School (\u79c0\u6c34\u4e2d\u5b78) and subsequently moved to Tianjin in 1922 to accompany his father. In 1926, after spending four years in Tianjin, Chern graduated from Fulun High School\u00a0[zh].[13]/nAt age 15, Chern entered the Faculty of Sciences of the Nankai University in Tianjin and was interested in physics, but not so much the laboratory, so he studied mathematics instead.[5][14] Chern graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1930.[14] At Nankai, Chern's mentor was mathematician Jiang Lifu, and Chern was also heavily influenced by Chinese physicist Rao Yutai, considered to be one of the founding fathers of modern Chinese informatics./nChern went to Beijing to work at the Tsinghua University Department of Mathematics as a teaching assistant. At the same time he also registered at Tsinghua Graduate School as a student. He studied projective differential geometry under Sun Guangyuan, a University of Chicago-trained geometer and logician who was also from Zhejiang. Sun is another mentor of Chern who is considered a founder of modern Chinese mathematics. In 1932, Chern published his first research article in the Tsinghua University Journal. In the summer of 1934, Chern graduated from Tsinghua with a master's degree, the first ever master's degree in mathematics issued in China.[13]/nYang Chen-Ning's father, Yang Ko-Chuen\u00a0[zh], another Chicago-trained professor at Tsinghua, but specializing in algebra, also taught Chern. At the same time, Chern was Chen-Ning Yang's teacher of undergraduate maths at Tsinghua. At Tsinghua, Hua Luogeng, also a mathematician, was Chern's colleague and roommate./nIn 1932, Wilhelm Blaschke from the University of Hamburg visited Tsinghua and was impressed by Chern and his research.[15]/nIn 1934, Chern received a scholarship to study in the United States at Princeton and Harvard, but at the time he wanted to study geometry and Europe was the center for the maths and sciences.[5]/nHe studied with the well-known Austrian geometer Wilhelm Blaschke.[14] Co-funded by Tsinghua and the Chinese Foundation of Culture and Education, Chern went to continue his study in mathematics in Germany with a scholarship.[14]/nChern studied at the University of Hamburg and worked under Blaschke's guidance first on the geometry of webs then on the Cartan-K\u00e4hler theory and invariant theory. He would often eat lunch and chat in German with fellow colleague Erich K\u00e4hler.[5]/nHe had a three-year scholarship but finished his degree very quickly in two years.[5] He obtained his Dr. rer.nat. (Doctor of Science, which is equivalent to PhD) degree in February, 1936.[14] He wrote his thesis in German, and it was titled Eine Invariantentheorie der Dreigewebe aus \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r}\n\n-dimensionalen Mannigfaltigkeiten im \n\n\n\n\nR\n\n2\nr\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R_{2r}}\n\n (English: An invariant theory of 3-webs of \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r}\n\n-dimensional manifolds in \n\n\n\n\nR\n\n2\nr\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R_{2r}}\n\n).[16]/nFor his third year, Blaschke recommended Chern to study at the University of Paris.[5]/nIt was at this time that he had to choose between the career of algebra in Germany under Emil Artin and the career of geometry in France under \u00c9lie-Joseph Cartan. Chern was tempted by what he called the \"organizational beauty\" of Artin's algebra, but in the end, he decided to go to France in September 1936.[17]/nHe spent one year at the Sorbonne in Paris. There he met Cartan once a fortnight. Chern said:[5]/nUsually the day after [meeting with Cartan] I would get a letter from him. He would say, \u201cAfter you left, I thought more about your questions...\u201d\u2014he had some results, and some more questions, and so on. He knew all these papers on simple Lie groups, Lie algebras, all by heart. When you saw him on the street, when a certain issue would come up, he would pull out some old envelope and write something and give you the answer. And sometimes it took me hours or even days to get the same answer... I had to work very hard./nIn August 1936, Chern watched the Summer Olympics in Berlin together with Chinese mathematician Hua Luogeng who paid Chern a brief visit. During that time, Hua was studying at the University of Cambridge in Britain./nIn the summer of 1937, Chern accepted the invitation of Tsinghua University and returned to China.[17] He was promoted to professor of mathematics at Tsinghua./nIn late 1937, however, the start of World War 2 forced Tsinghua and other academic institutions to move away from Beijing to west China.[18] Three universities including Peking University, Tsinghua, and Nankai formed the temporary National Southwestern Associated University (NSAU), and relocated to Kunming, Yunnan province. Chern never reached Beijing./nIn 1939, Chern married Shih-Ning Cheng, and the couple had two children, Paul and May.[18]/nThe war prevented Chern from having regular contacts with the outside mathematical community. He wrote to Cartan about his situation, to which Cartan sent him a box of his reprints. Chern spent a considerable amount of time pondering over Cartan's papers and published despite relative isolation. In 1943, his papers gained international recognition, and Oswald Veblen invited him to the IAS. Because of the war, it took him a week to reach Princeton via US military aircraft.[5]/nIn July 1943, Chern went to the United States, and worked at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton on characteristic classes in differential geometry. There he worked with Andr\u00e9 Weil on the Chern\u2013Weil homomorphism and theory of characteristic classes, later to be foundational to the Atiyah\u2013Singer index theorem. Shortly afterwards, he was invited by Solomon Lefschetz to be an editor of Annals of Mathematics.[18]/nBetween 1943-1964 he was invited back to the IAS on several occasions.[12] On Chern, Weil wrote:[19]/n... we seemed to share a common attitude towards such subjects, or towards mathematics in general; we were both striving to strike at the root of each question while freeing our minds from preconceived notions about what others might have regarded as the right or the wrong way of dealing with it./nIt was at the IAS that his work culminated in his publication of the generalization of the famous Gauss\u2013Bonnet theorem to higher dimensional manifolds, now known today as the Chern theorem. It is widely considered to be his magnum opus.[12][5][2] This period at the IAS was a turning point in career, having a major impact on mathematics, while fundamentally altering the course of differential geometry and algebraic geometry.[3][12] In a letter to the then director Frank Aydelotte, Chern wrote:[12]/n\u201cThe years 1943\u201345 will undoubtedly be decisive in my career, and I have profited not only in the mathematical side. I am inclined to think that among the people who have stayed at the Institute, I was one who has profited the most, but the other people may think the same way.\u201d/nChern returned to Shanghai in 1945 to help found the Institute of Mathematics of the Academia Sinica.[18] Chern was the acting president of the institute. Wu Wenjun was Chern's graduate student at the institute./nIn 1948, Chern was elected one of the first academicians of the Academia Sinica. He was the youngest academician elected (at age 37)./nIn 1948, he accepted an invitation by Weyl and Veblen to return to Princeton as a professor.[2][18]/nBy the end of 1948, Chern returned to the United States and IAS.[18] He brought his family with him.[2] In 1949, he was invited by Weil to become professor of mathematics at the University of Chicago and accepted the position as chair of geometry.[18][2] Coincidentally, Ernest Preston Lane, former Chair at UChicago Department of Mathematics, was the doctoral advisor of Chern's undergraduate mentor at Tsinghua\u2014Sun Guangyuan./nIn 1950 he was invited by the International Congress of Mathematicians in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He delivered his address on the Differential Geometry of Fiber Bundles. According to Hans Samelson, in the lecture Chern introduced the notion of a connection on a principal fiber bundle, a generalization of the Levi-Civita connection.[2] \nShii/nIn 1960 Chern moved to the University of California, Berkeley.[18] He worked and stayed there until he became an emeritus professor in 1979.[20] In 1961, Chern became a naturalized citizen of the United States.[2] In the same year, he was elected member of the United States National Academy of Sciences.[21]/nMy election to the US National Academy of Sciences was a prime factor for my US citizenship. In 1960 I was tipped about the possibility of an academy membership. Realizing that a citizenship was necessary, I applied for it. The process was slowed because of my association to Oppenheimer. As a consequence I became a US citizen about a month before my election to academy membership./nIn 1964, Chern was a vice-president of American Mathematical Society (AMS)./nChern retired from UC Berkeley in 1979.[22][23] In 1981, together with colleagues Calvin C. Moore and Isadore Singer, he founded the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) at Berkeley, serving as the director until 1984. Afterward he became the honorary director of the institute. MSRI now is one of the largest and most prominent mathematical institutes in the world.[21] Shing-Tung Yau was one of his PhD students during this period, and he later won the Fields Medal in 1982./nDuring WW2, the US did not have much of a scene in geometry (which is why he chose to study in Germany). Chern was largely responsible in making the US a leading research hub in the field, but he remained modest about his achievements, preferring to say that he is a man of 'small problems' rather than 'big views.'[5]/nThe Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9 was issued by the United States and the People's Republic of China on February 27, 1972. The relationship between these two nations started to normalize, and American citizens were allowed to visit China. In September 1972, Chern visited Beijing with his wife. During this period of time, Chern visited China 25 times, of which 14 were to his home province Zhejiang./nHe was admired and respected by Chinese leaders Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and Jiang Zemin. Because of foreign prestigious scientific support, Chern was able to revive mathematical research in China, producing a generation of influential Chinese mathematicians.[7][5]/nChern founded the Nankai Institute for Mathematics (NKIM) at his alma mater Nankai in Tianjin. The institute was formally established in 1984 and fully opened on October 17, 1985. NKIM was renamed the Chern Institute of Mathematics in 2004 after Chern's death. He was treated as a rock star and cultural icon in China.[7] Regarding his influence in China and help raising a generation of new mathematicians, ZALA films says:[7]/nSeveral world-renowned figures, such as Gang Tian and Shing-Tung Yau, consider Chern the mentor who helped them study in western countries following the bleak years of the Cultural Revolution, when Chinese universities were closed and academic pursuits suppressed. By the time Chern started returning to China regularly during the 1980s, he had become a celebrity; every school child knew his name, and TV cameras documented his every move whenever he ventured forth from the institute he established at Nankai University.[7]/nHe has said that back then the main obstruent to the growth of math in China is the low pay, which is important considering that after the cultural revolution many families were impoverished. But he has said that given China's size, it naturally has a large talent pool of budding mathematicians.[5]\nNobel Prize winner and former student CN Yang has said[24]/n\u201cChern and I and many others felt that we have the responsibility to try to create more understanding between the American people and the Chinese people, and... all of us shared the desire to promote more exchanges.\u201d/nIn 1999, Chern moved from Berkeley back to Tianjin, China permanently until his death.[7]/nBased on Chern's advice, a mathematical research center was established in Taipei, Taiwan, whose co-operational partners are National Taiwan University, National Tsing Hua University and the Academia Sinica Institute of Mathematics.[25]/nIn 2002, he convinced the Chinese government (the PRC) for the first time to host the International Congress of Mathematicians in Beijing.[24] In the speech at the opening ceremony he said:[26]/n\u201cThe great Confucius guided China spiritually for over 2,000 years. The main doctrine is \u201c\u4ec1\u201d pronounced \u201cren\u201d, meaning two people, i.e., human relationship. Modern science has been highly competitive. I think an injection of the human element will make our subject more healthy and enjoyable. Let us wish that this congress will open a new era in the future development of math.\u201d/nChern was also a director and advisor of the Center of Mathematical Sciences at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, Zhejiang./nChern died of heart failure at Tianjin Medical University General Hospital in 2004 at age 93.[27]/nIn 2010 George Csicsery featured him in the documentary short Taking the Long View: The Life of Shiing-shen Chern.[28]/nHis former residence, Ningyuan (\u5be7\u5712), is still in campus of Nankai University, kept in the way when he was living there. Every year on December 3, Ningyuan is open for visitors for memorial of him./nPhysics Nobel Prize winner (and former student) C. N. Yang has said that Chern is on par with Euclid, Gauss, Riemann, Cartan. Two of Chern's most important contributions that have reshaped the fields of geometry and topology include/nIn 2007, Chern's disciple and IAS director Phillip Griffiths edited Inspired by S. S. Chern: A Memorial Volume in Honor of A Great Mathematician (World Scientific Press). Griffiths wrote:[12]/n\u201cMore than any other mathematician, Shiing-Shen Chern defined the subject of global differential geometry, a central area in contemporary mathematics. In work that spanned almost seven decades, he helped to shape large areas of modern mathematics... I think that he, more than anyone, was the founder of one of the central areas of modern mathematics.\u201d/nHis work extended over all the classic fields of differential geometry as well as more modern ones including general relativity, invariant theory, characteristic classes, cohomology theory, Morse theory, Fiber bundles, Sheaf theory, Cartan's theory of differential forms, etc. His work included areas currently-fashionable, perennial, foundational, and nascent:[2][29]/nHe was a follower of \u00c9lie Cartan, working on the 'theory of equivalence' in his time in China from 1937 to 1943, in relative isolation. In 1954 he published his own treatment of the pseudogroup problem that is in effect the touchstone of Cartan's geometric theory. He used the moving frame method with success only matched by its inventor; he preferred in complex manifold theory to stay with the geometry, rather than follow the potential theory. Indeed, one of his books is entitled \"Complex Manifolds without Potential Theory\"./nAlong with Cartan, Chern is one of the mathematicians known for popularizing the use of differential forms in math and physics. In his biography, Richard Palais and Chuu-Lian Terng have written[29]/n... we would like to point out a unifying theme that runs through all of it: his absolute mastery of the techniques of differential forms and his artful application of these techniques in solving geometric problems. This was a magic mantle, handed down to him by his great teacher, \u00c9lie Cartan. It permitted him to explore in depth new mathematical territory where others could not enter. What makes differential forms such an ideal tool for studying local and global geometric properties (and for relating them to each other) is their two complementary aspects. They admit, on the one hand, the local operation of exterior differentiation, and on the other the global operation of integration over cochains, and these are related via Stokes's Theorem./nWhile at the IAS, there were two competing methods of geometry: the tensor calculus and the newer differential forms. Chern has written[5]/nI usually like to say that vector fields is like a man, and differential forms is like a woman. Society must have two sexes. If you only have one, it\u2019s not enough./nIn the last years of his life, he advocated the study of Finsler geometry, writing several books and articles on the subject.[34] His research on Finsler geometry is continued through Tian Gang, Paul C. Yang, and Sun-Yung Alice Chang of Princeton University./nHe was known for unifying geometric and topological methods to prove stunning new results./nChern received numerous honors and awards in his life, including:/nChern was given a number of honorary degrees, including from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (LL.D. 1969), University of Chicago (D.Sc. 1969), ETH Zurich (Dr.Math. 1982), Stony Brook University (D.Sc. 1985), TU Berlin (Dr.Math. 1986), his alma mater Hamburg (D.Sc. 1971) and Nankai (honorary doctorate, 1985), etc./nChern was also granted numerous honorary professorships, including at Peking University (Beijing, 1978), his alma mater Nankai (Tianjin, 1978), Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Systems Science (Beijing, 1980), Jinan University (Guangzhou, 1980), Chinese Academy of Sciences Graduate School (1984), Nanjing University (Nanjing, 1985), East China Normal University (Shanghai, 1985), USTC (Hefei, 1985), Beijing Normal University (1985), Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, 1985), Hangzhou University (1986, the university was merged into Zhejiang University in 1998), Fudan University (Shanghai, 1986), Shanghai University of Technology (1986, the university was merged to establish Shanghai University in 1994), Tianjin University (1987), Tohoku University (Sendai, Japan, 1987), etc./nChern liked to play contract bridge, Go (game), read Wuxia-literature of Jin Yong and had an interest in Chinese philosophy and history.[24]/nIn 1975, Chen Ning Yang and Chern found out that their research in non-abelian gauge theory and Fiber bundle describe the same theoretical structure, which showed a surprising connection between physics and mathematics. Therefore, Chern asked Fan Zeng to finish a chinese painting named Shiing-Shen Chern and Chen Ning Yang for that. The Painting was later donated to the Nankai University./nA polyglot, he spoke German, French, English, Wu and Mandarin Chinese./n\u201cWhenever we had to go to the chancellor to make some special request, we always took Chern along, and it always worked,\u201d says Berkeley mathematician Rob Kirby. \u201cSomehow he had a presence, a gravitas. There was something about him that people just listened to him, and usually did things his way.\u201d[7]/nIn 1979 a Chern Symposium offered him a honorary song in tribute:[2]/nHail to Chern! Mathematics Greatest!/nHe made Gauss-Bonnet a household word,/nIntrinsic proofs he found,/nThroughout the World his truths abound,/nChern classes he gave us,/nand Secondary Invariants,/nFibre Bundles and Sheaves,/nDistributions and Foliated Leaves!/nAll Hail All Hail to CHERN./nIt's called the Chern song.[2]/nAllyn Jackson writes[5]/nS. S. Chern is the recipient of many international honors, including six honorary doctorates, the U.S. National Medal of Science, Israel\u2019s Wolf Prize, and membership in learned academies around the world. He has also received a more homegrown honor, the dream-turned-reality of an appreciative student of 30 years ago, who grew up in the Bay Area./nWhen Robert Uomini would buy his 10 tickets for the California State Lottery, he had an unusual \u201cwhat if I win?\u201d fantasy: He wanted to endow a professorship to honor S. S. Chern. While an undergraduate at U.C. Berkeley in the 1960s, Uomini was greatly inspired by a differential geometry course he took from Chern. With Chern\u2019s support and encouragement, Uomini entered graduate school at Berkeley and received his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1976. Twenty years later, while working as a consultant to Sun Microsystems in Palo Alto, Uomini won $22 million in the state lottery. He could then realize his dream of expressing his gratitude in a concrete way./nUomini and his wife set up the Robert G. Uomini and Louise B. Bidwell Foundation to support an extended visit of an outstanding mathematician to the U.C. Berkeley campus. There have been three Chern Visiting Professors so far: Sir Michael Atiyah of the University of Cambridge (1996), Richard Stanley of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1997), and Friedrich Hirzebruch of the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn (1998). Jean-Pierre Serre of the Coll\u00e8ge de France was the Chern Visiting Professor for 1999. [sic]/nThe foundation also helps to support the Chern Symposium, a yearly one-day event held in Berkeley during the period when the Chern Visiting Professor is in residence. The March 1998 Symposium was co-sponsored by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute and was expanded to run for three days, featuring a dozen speakers./nThe MSRI also set up a Chern Professorship, funded by Chern's children May and Paul as well as James Simons.[43]/nAbraham Pais wrote about Chern in his book Subtle is the Lord. To paraphrase one passage: the outstanding mathematician Chern has two things to say, 1) I feel very mysterious that in the fields I'm working on (general relativity and differential geometry) there is so much more that can be explored; and 2) when talking with Albert Einstein (his colleague at the IAS) about his problem of a Grand Unified Theory, I realized the difference between mathematics and physics is at the heart of the journey towards a theory of everything./nManfredo Do Carmo dedicated his book on Riemannian Geometry to Chern, his PhD advisor./nIn Yau's autobiography, he talks a lot about his advisor Chern.

He is best known for his association with Albert Einstein.[1]/nSolovine was born in Ia\u0219i, a university city in eastern Romania, near the border with Moldova.  As a young student of philosophy in Bern, Solovine applied to study physics with Albert Einstein in response to an advertisement. The two men struck up a close relationship and Einstein was said to say to Solovine a few days after meeting him: \"It is not necessary to give you lessons in physics. The discussion about the problems which we face in physics today is much more interesting; simply come to me when you wish. I am pleased to be able to talk to you.\"/nOne day Solovine suggested reading and debating the works of great authors. Einstein agreed enthusiastically and soon mathematician Conrad Habicht (1876\u20131958) became involved in what was to be known as the \"Akademie Olympia\" (Olympia Academy). Often their meetings, held in Einstein's flat, would last until the early morning hours./nOn one occasion Solovine missed a scheduled meeting in his flat, preferring to listen to a concert in the city. He had prepared a meal for his friends with a note: \"Amicis carissimis ova dura et salutem.\" (To the beloved friends, hard-boiled eggs and greetings). However Einstein and Habicht turned his flat upside down after they had eaten the meal. Every piece of furniture was moved and plates, cups, forks, knives and books were scattered all over the flat. The rooms were also covered in smoke from Einstein's pipe and Habicht's cigar. They left a \"worthy warning\" on the wall. There you could read: \"Amico carissimo fumum spissum et salutem.\" (To the dearest friend, thick smoke and greetings). Einstein is reputed to have greeted Solovine the next evening with the following words: \"You lousy guy, how, you were cheeky enough to stay away from a meeting of the Akademie to listen to the violin?

His masters and PhD thesis advisor was Yakov G. Sinai. In 1986 (after Perestroika started) he finally received Doctor of Sciences degree in \"Theoretical and Mathematical Physics\". Bunimovich is a Regents' Professor of Mathematics at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Bunimovich is a Fellow of the Institute of Physics and was awarded Humboldt Prize in Physics./nHis Master's proved that some classes of quadratic maps of an interval have an absolutely continuous invariant measure and strong stochastic properties.[1]/nBunimovich is mostly known for discovery of a fundamental mechanism of chaos in dynamical systems called the mechanism of defocusing.[2] This discovery came as a striking surprise not only to mathematics but to physics community as well. Physicists could not believe that such (physical!) phenomenon is possible (even though a rigorous mathematical proof was provided) until they conducted massive numerical experiments. The most famous class of chaotic dynamical systems of this type, dynamical billiards are focusing chaotic billiards such as the Bunimovich stadium (\"Bunimovich flowers\", elliptic flowers, etc.).[3] Later Bunimovich proved that his mechanism of defocusing works in all dimensions despite of the phenomenon of astigmatism.[4] Bunimovich introduced absolutely focusing mirrors, which is a new notion in geometric optics, and proved that only such mirrors could be focusing parts of chaotic billiards.[5] He also constructed so called Bunimovich mushrooms, which are visual examples of billiards with mixed regular and chaotic dynamics.[6][7] Physical realizations of Bunimovich stadia have been constructed for both classical and quantum investigations../nAlthough the discovery of defocusing mechanism was just a part of Bunimovich's PhD thesis, he could not find any job after finishing graduate school thanks to antisemitic policies in the Soviet Union. Bunimovich was unable to ever find work as a mathematician in the Soviet Union. Moreover, while finally finding a work place he was not allowed to publish mathematical papers because in the places, where he worked, authorities refused to confirm that his mathematical papers contain no state secrets. Likewise for a long time he could not attend mathematical conferences even in the Soviet Union. However, although being trained as a pure mathematician, Bunimovich turned out to be able to work in applications to biomedical studies and in oceanology./nNotably, Bunimovich introduced and investigated hierarchical models of human populations,[8] which allowed to clarify laws of distribution of hereditary diseases and explain data on migration in industrial parts of developed countries. He realized and demonstrated that the lengths of remissions in schizophrenia form a Markov process, i.e. that a length of remission depends only upon the length of the previous remission.  Besides he demonstrated that among the types of attacks in schizophrenia there are those which more (or less) likely to occur after the other types of attacks.[9] Before it was just known that the same type of attack will basically always happen./nBunimovich discovered traps for internal waves in non-homogeneous stratified fluids and analyzed their dynamics in such traps which in particular allowed to explain some surprising observations on internal waves in the oceans.[10]/nOne of the most fundamental problems in Statistical Physics is to derive Deterministic time-irreversible macro-dynamics from deterministic time-reversible Newtonian micro-dynamics. This problem, which was considered before to be mathematically non-tractable was settled in the paper[11] by Bunimovich with Ya.G. Sinai for diffusion of mass in periodic Lorentz gas. In their previous paper was constructed the first infinite Markov partition for chaotic systems with singularities which allowed to transform this deterministic problem into probabilistic one. \nThen in Bunimovich's paper with H.Spohn[12] diffusion of shear and bulk viscosities  in deterministic periodic fluid was rigorously derived./nThe paper by Bunimovich with Ya.G. Sinai[13] pioneered rigorous studies of the space-time chaos. There were even no exact definition of this widely observed in experiments phenomenon. In this paper such definition was given and it was proved that space-time chaos gets realized in weakly interacting time-chaotic systems./nTogether with Ben Webb Bunimovich introduced and developed the theory of Isospectral transformations for analysis of multi-dimensional systems and networks.[14] This approach allows to obtain various types of visualization of networks as well to uncover their hierarchical structure and hidden symmetries./nBunimovich pioneered a rigorous theory of Finite-time dynamics and finite-time predictions for strongly chaotic and random systems.[15][16]/nTogether with Skums and Khudyakov Bunimovich  discovered phenomenon of local immunodeficiency which demonstrates how viruses can cooperate to overcome an immune response of a human organism.[17] It allowed to clarify numerous unexplained phenomena in evolution of the Hepatitis C and serves as new tool to study any disease with cross-immunoreactivity.", "67336969": "T\u00f5nu M\u00f6ls (12 June 1939 in Tartu \u2013 1 December 2019[1] ) was an Estonian mathematician and biologist.[2]/nIn 1965 he described the moth Epirrhoe tartuensis.[3]/nFrom 1994 until 2004, he was the president of Estonian Naturalists' Society.[2]/nIn 2001, he was awarded with Order of the White Star, V class.[4]", "45021966": "Luchezar L.

For the census, postal workers delivered a questionnaire to be filled out and returned.\u00a0There were problems in getting complete and accurate response in the census. He helped design the sample and the statistical procedures to generate estimates of unemployment and estimates of the standard errors of the unemployment estimates, and to project sample estimates to smaller areas through regression relationships. \u00a0In the late 1930s and early 1940s the idea of using sample surveys for official governmental guidance, was quite new. \u00a0\u201cBefore that the Census Bureau had the idea that they couldn\u2019t do sampling because that would discredit the results; they had to have complete coverage.\u201d[1]/nThis experience encouraged the Works Progress Administration beginning in 1940  to sponsor the development of a monthly sample survey of households to provide estimates of employment and unemployment, later known as the Current Population Survey./nHis papers with William N.

Four months each winter he attended district schools, working for his board while doing so. During his schooldays he wished to learn algebra, and as his district school teacher knew no algebra, he walked several miles to a neighbouring town where he bought Ray's Elementary Algebra.[4] He proceeded to master the material without any support except encouragement of his mother, who had had too little schooling to learn to write./nLoomis proved to be a sufficiently apt scholar to become a teacher himself in 1873. He taught during the summer and managed not only to save enough money to help his mother support her family, but also for himself to attend and assist at Baldwin University at Berea, Ohio, during the winter. His industry and thrift enabled him to buy a home, in Shreve, Ohio, where he established his mother and brothers the fall of 1876. This was partly possible because of his abstemious habits, eschewing both tobacco and strong drink.

He attained his B.S. at Baldwin University in 1880 under Professor Aaron Schuyler, and then his A.M. in 1886 and Ph.D. in 1888 from Wooster University, Ohio. In 1900 the Cleveland Law School awarded him the LL.B. degree, and he was admitted to the State Bar in June 1900./nFrom 1880 to 1885 he served as principal, first at the Burbank Academy in Burbank, Ohio, then at the Richfield Township High School, in Summit County, Ohio.

He also wrote \"The Teaching of Mathematics in High Schools\", and \"Original Investigation Or How to Attack an Exercise in Geometry\". Possibly his best-known work however, is \"The Pythagorean Proposition\", in which he collected, classified, and discussed 344 proofs. The book is still a work of reference.[5]\nAlso he prepared in manuscript, ready for publication, books and articles estimated to number over one hundred, but it is not clear how many of them ever were printed.

Her father, an Army veteran, was a sharecropper who went to work for Cargill Granary and was eventually paralyzed and disabled. Her mother was a domestic worker.[3] She attended Lakeview School, the only school for black children in the area, and graduated in 1956, where she was a good student and basketball player. Scissum's father was convinced that she would attend college and repeatedly told her this from a very young age. Scissum was awarded a small scholarship to study at Alabama A&M University which she supplemented by working at a telephone switchboard.

Here she very quickly realised that teaching was not for her as she worried about the students.[4] Scissum joined NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center as an entry level mathematician in 1964 after a recommendation from a friend and was the first African-American mathematician to be employed by Marshall.[5] She published a NASA report in 1967, \u201cSurvey of Solar Cycle Prediction Models,\u201d which put forward techniques for improved forecasting of the sunspot cycle.[6] In the mid-1970s, she worked as a space scientist in the Space Environment Branch of Marshall's Space Sciences Laboratory and she led activities in Marshall's Atmospheric, Magnetospheric, and Plasmas in Space project.[2] Following the completion of her PhD, she later moved to Maryland to work in Goddard Space Flight Center as a computer systems analyst responsible for analyzing and directing NASA management information and technical support systems.[7] She retired in 2005.[3]/nScissum's accomplishments have earned her recognition by Mathematically Gifted & Black as a Black History Month 2018 Honoree.[7]/nScissum was passionate about inclusion and volunteered to be an equal employment opportunity officer. Her contributions in this role were recognised by an award from NASA Administrator James Fletcher, but she did note that fighting for others sometimes put her own career in jeopardy. She was warned by a top female supervisor that management were unhappy with the number of complaints that she was handling.[4] In 1975, Scissum wrote an article for the National Technical Association, \"Equal Employment Opportunity and the Supervisor \u2013 A Counselor's View\", which argued that many discrimination complaints could be avoided \"through adequate and meaningful communication.\"[2] She noted that her progression and the progression of her black colleagues was limited at NASA and expressed frustration and anger at this. \"The problem (blacks) had was moving into management and being over people,\" Scissum said. \"I guess (NASA) was afraid people would fight against it. I guess. It's hard to understand. It's always been hard for me to understand \u2013 the motivation for all this discrimination, because most of it seems unnecessary.

Two years later, in 1965, he received his master's degree in Mathematics from Patna University. After a brief stay at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in their Ph.D. program for Mathematics, Prasad entered the Ph.D. program at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in 1966. There he began a long and extensive collaboration with his advisor M. S. Raghunathan on several topics including the study of lattices in semi-simple Lie groups and the congruence subgroup problem. In 1976, Prasad received his Ph.D. from the University of Mumbai. Prasad became an associate professor at TIFR in 1979, and a professor in 1984. In 1992 he left TIFR to join the faculty at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he is  the Raoul Bott Professor Emeritus of Mathematics./nGopal Prasad's parents were Ram Krishna Prasad and Lakshmi Devi. Ram Krishna Prasad was a social worker, philanthropist, and was jailed by the British for his participation in the Indian freedom struggle against British rule.

Shrawan Kumar, Professor of Mathematics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Pawan Kumar, Professor of Astrophysics at the University of Texas, Austin and Dipendra Prasad, Professor of Mathematics at the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, are his younger brothers./nPrasad's early work was on discrete subgroups of real and p-adic semi-simple groups. He proved the \"strong rigidity\" of lattices in real semi-simple groups of rank 1 and also of lattices in p-adic groups, see [1] and [2]. He then tackled group-theoretic and arithmetic questions on semi-simple algebraic groups. He proved the \"strong approximation\" property for simply connected semi-simple groups over global function fields [3]. Prasad determined the topological central extensions of these groups and computed the \"metaplectic kernel\" for isotropic groups in collaboration with M. S. Raghunathan, see [11], [12] and [10]. Prasad and Raghunathan have also obtained results on the Kneser-Tits problem, [13]. Later, together with Andrei Rapinchuk, Prasad gave a precise computation of the metaplectic kernel for all simply connected semi-simple groups, see [14]./nIn 1987, Prasad found a formula for the volume of S-arithmetic quotients of semi-simple groups, [4]. Using this formula and certain number theoretic and Galois-cohomological estimates, Armand Borel and Gopal Prasad proved several finiteness theorems about arithmetic groups, [6]. The volume formula, together with number-theoretic and Bruhat-Tits theoretic considerations led to a classification, by Gopal Prasad and Sai-Kee Yeung, of fake projective planes (in the theory of smooth projective complex surfaces) into 28 non-empty classes [21] (see also [22] and [23]). This classification, together with computations by Donald Cartwright and Tim Steger, has led to a complete list of fake projective planes. This list consists of exactly 50 fake projective planes, up to isometry (distributed among the 28 classes). This work was the subject of a talk in the Bourbaki seminar./nPrasad has worked on the representation theory of reductive p-adic groups with Allen Moy. The filtrations of parahoric subgroups, referred to as the \"Moy-Prasad filtration\", is widely used in representation theory and harmonic analysis. Moy and Prasad used these filtrations and Bruhat\u2013Tits theory to prove the existence of  \"unrefined minimal K-types\", to define the notion of \"depth\" of an irreducible admissible representation and to give a classification of representations of depth zero, see [8] and [9]. The results and techniques introduced in these two papers [8],[9] enabled a series of important developments in the field./nIn collaboration with Andrei Rapinchuk, Prasad has studied  Zariski-dense subgroups of semi-simple groups and proved the existence in such a subgroup of regular semi-simple elements with many desirable properties, [15], [16]. These elements have been used in the investigation of geometric and ergodic theoretic questions. Prasad and Rapinchuk introduced a new notion of \"weak-commensurability\" of arithmetic subgroups and determined \"weak- commensurability classes\" of arithmetic groups in a given semi-simple group. They used their results on weak-commensurability to obtain results on length-commensurable and isospectral arithmetic locally symmetric spaces, see [17], [18] and [19]./nTogether with Jiu-Kang Yu, Prasad has studied the fixed point set under the action of a finite group of automorphisms of a reductive p-adic group G on the Bruhat-Building of G, [24]. In another joint work, that has been used in the geometric Langlands program, Prasad and Yu determined all the quasi-reductive group schemes over a discrete valuation ring (DVR), [25]./nIn collaboration with Brian Conrad and Ofer Gabber, Prasad has studied the structure of pseudo-reductive groups, and also provided proofs of the conjugacy theorems for general smooth connected linear algebraic groups, announced without detailed proofs by Armand Borel and Jacques Tits; their  research monograph [26] contains all this. A second monograph [27] contains a complete classification of pseudo-reductive groups, including a Tits-style classification and also many interesting examples. The classification of pseudo-reductive groups already has many applications. There was a Bourbaki seminar in March 2010 on the work of Tits, Conrad-Gabber-Prasad on pseudo-reductive groups./nPrasad has developed  new methods for unramified and tamely ramified descents in Bruhat-Tits theory [28][29]. Together with Tasho Kaletha, he has recently written a book [30] on Bruhat-Tits theory which contains new proofs of several results./nPrasad has received the Guggenheim Fellowship, the Humboldt Senior Research Award, and the Raoul Bott Professorship at the University of Michigan.

Einstein told him that he should first make his mark on the world, for then people would listen to him. We have all been rewarded by Kemeny's decision to heed Einstein's advice.\"/nUnited World Federalists was the movement through that he met his future wife, then-Smith student Jean Alexander.[8]/nKemeny was appointed to the Dartmouth Mathematics Department as a full professor in 1953, at the age of 27.[1] Two years later he became chairman of the department, and held this post until 1967. \nKemeny ventured into curriculum development when he introduced Finite mathematics courses. He teamed with Gerald L. Thompson and J. Laurie Snell to write Introduction to Finite Mathematics (1957) for students of biology and social sciences. The Dartmouth mathematics department professors also wrote Finite Mathematical Structures (1959) and Finite Mathematics with Business Applications (1962). Other colleges and universities followed this lead and several more textbooks in Finite Mathematics were composed elsewhere. The topic of Markov chains was particularly popular so Kemeny teamed with J. Laurie Snell to publish Finite Markov Chains (1960) to provide an introductory college textbook. Considering the advances using potential theory obtained by G. A. Hunt, they wrote Denumerable Markov Chains in 1966.[9] This textbook, suitable for advanced seminars,[10] was followed by a second edition in 1976 when an additional chapter on random fields by David Griffeath was included./nKemeny and Kurtz were pioneers in the use of computers for ordinary people. After early experiments with ALGOL 30 and DOPE on the LGP-30, they invented the BASIC programming language in 1964, as well as one of the world's first time-sharing systems, the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System (DTSS). In 1974, the American Federation of Information Processing Societies gave an award to Kemeny and Kurtz at the National Computer Conference for their work on BASIC and time-sharing.[11] BASIC was the language used in most software written during the rise of the Apple II, the Commodore, the TRS-80, and the IBM PCs throughout the 80s, and it's successor on PCs, Visual Basic (.NET), is still in use in 2023.[12] In 1980-ies, Sinclair BASIC was also essential for Sinclair ZX family of computers.[13]/nKemeny was president of Dartmouth from 1970 to 1981, and continued to teach undergraduate courses and to do research and publish papers during his time as president. He presided over the coeducation of Dartmouth in 1972. He also instituted the \"Dartmouth Plan\" of year-round operations, thereby allowing more students without more buildings. During his administration, Dartmouth became more proactive in recruiting and retaining minority students[2] and revived its founding commitment to provide education for American Indians. Kemeny made Dartmouth a pioneer in student use of computers, equating computer literacy with reading literacy. In 1982 he returned to teaching full-time./nIn 1983, Kemeny and Kurtz co-founded a company called True BASIC, Inc. to market True BASIC, an updated version of the language./nJohn Kemeny died at the age of 66, the result of heart failure in Lebanon, New Hampshire[2] on December 26, 1992.[4] He had lived in Etna, near the Dartmouth Campus.", "2390961": "Juan de Herrera (1530 \u2013 15 January 1597) was a Spanish architect, mathematician and geometrician./nOne of the most outstanding Spanish architects in the 16th century, Herrera represents the peak of the Renaissance in Spain. His sober style reached full development in buildings like the Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial.  The Herrerian style was named after him, and was representative of the architecture of the Spanish Empire of Philip II and his Austrian successors./nHerrera was interested in many branches of knowledge. His Discurso sobre la figura c\u00fabica (Discussion of the Cubic form) tells us about his notable knowledge about geometry and mathematics. He participated in the military campaigns of Charles V in Germany, Flanders and Italy./nJuan de Herrera started his architectural career in 1561 with the Royal Palace of Aranjuez. In 1562 he also made some drawings for the Libro del saber de astronom\u00eda (The Book of Astronomical Knowledge)./nIn 1563 he started to work under Juan Bautista de Toledo in the construction of El Escorial. After the death of de Toledo in 1567, Herrera became the director architect of the works, enlarging the plan, building the monumental western fa\u00e7ade, the central Basilica and the pavilion of the Patio de los Evangelistas (Court of the Evangelists), and modifying the construction techniques and roofing. Stylistically, he changed the image of the fa\u00e7ades and introducing his personal sober style in accordance to the wishes of King Philip. The main keys of his design are the impressive horizontal unified composition and the use of bare granite, omitting the classical orders for large surfaces. This style introduced in the monastery influenced Spanish architecture for over a century, becoming known as the Herrerian style./nThe Cathedral of Valladolid and the today Archivo General de Indias building were also designed by Herrera. He was the original designer for the Plaza Mayor in Madrid./nAs instructed in his 1584 will, after his death, his sepulchre was transferred from Madrid to the Church of San Juan Bautista in Malia\u00f1o, Cantabria.[1]", "359352": "Oscar Zariski (April 24, 1899 \u2013 July 4, 1986) was a Russian-born American mathematician and one of the most influential algebraic geometers of the 20th century./nZariski was born Oscher (also transliterated as Ascher or Osher) Zaritsky to a Jewish family (his parents were Bezalel Zaritsky and Hanna Tennenbaum) and in 1918 studied at the University of Kyiv. He left Kyiv in 1920 to study at the University of Rome where he became a disciple of the Italian school of algebraic geometry, studying with Guido Castelnuovo, Federigo Enriques and Francesco Severi./nZariski wrote a doctoral dissertation in 1924 on a topic in Galois theory, which was proposed to him by Castelnuovo. At the time of his dissertation publication, he changed his name to Oscar Zariski./nZariski emigrated to the United States in 1927 supported by Solomon Lefschetz. He had a position at Johns Hopkins University where he became professor in 1937. During this period, he wrote Algebraic Surfaces as a summation of the work of the Italian school.\nThe book was published in 1935 and reissued 36 years later, with detailed notes by Zariski's students that illustrated how the field of algebraic geometry had changed. It is still an important reference./nIt seems to have been this work that set the seal of Zariski's discontent with the approach of the Italians to birational geometry. He addressed the question of rigour by recourse to commutative algebra. The Zariski topology, as it was later known, is adequate for biregular geometry, where varieties are mapped by polynomial functions. That theory is too limited for algebraic surfaces, and even for curves with singular points. A rational map is to a regular map as a rational function is to a polynomial: it may be indeterminate at some points. In geometric terms, one has to work with functions defined on some open, dense set of a given variety. The description of the behaviour on the complement may require infinitely near points to be introduced to account for limiting behaviour along different directions. This introduces a need, in the surface case, to use also valuation theory to describe the phenomena such as blowing up (balloon-style, rather than explosively)./nAfter spending a year 1946\u20131947 at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign, Zariski became professor at Harvard University in 1947 where he remained until his retirement in 1969. In 1945, he fruitfully discussed foundational matters for algebraic geometry with Andr\u00e9 Weil. Weil's interest was in putting an abstract variety theory in place, to support the use of the Jacobian variety in his proof of the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields, a direction rather oblique to Zariski's interests. The two sets of foundations weren't reconciled at that point./nAt Harvard, Zariski's students included Shreeram Abhyankar, Heisuke Hironaka, David Mumford, Michael Artin and Steven Kleiman\u2014thus spanning the main areas of advance in singularity theory, moduli theory and cohomology in the next generation. Zariski himself worked on equisingularity theory. Some of his major results, Zariski's main theorem and the Zariski theorem on holomorphic functions, were amongst the results generalized and included in the programme of Alexander Grothendieck that ultimately unified algebraic geometry./nZariski proposed the first example of a Zariski surface in 1958./nZariski was a Jewish atheist.[1]/nZariski was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1944,[2] the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1948,[3] and the American Philosophical Society in 1951.[4] Zariski was awarded the Steele Prize in 1981, and in the same year the Wolf Prize in Mathematics with Lars Ahlfors. He wrote also Commutative Algebra in two volumes, with Pierre Samuel. His papers have been published by MIT Press, in four volumes.

She studied math for many years at the University of Warsaw, where she earned her Master of Science degree in applied mathematics in 1972. A few years later, she received her PhD from the same university in the same field of study.[4]/nAfter receiving her PhD, Lasiecka started to transfer her knowledge of Applied Mathematics to others in addition to more personal studying and research. Her first teaching job was at the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1975, and she later ventured to the United States a few years later, teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles. She has been teaching in the US ever since. The following is a chart listing the institutions in which Lasiecka has been a teaching faculty member of.[4]/nOptimization is the mathematical practice of finding the maximum or minimum values for a specific function. It has many real-world uses, and is a  common practice for people of many different professions./nThe work of Lasiecka involves the optimization differential systems. These involve an optimization problems over functions, with a constraint that relates a function to its derivatives. She has written extensively about this topic in her collaborative work Optimization Methods in Partial Differential Equations.[5]/nControl Theory is one of Irena Lasiecka's chief areas of study. She begins her book, Mathematical Control Theory of Coupled PDEs, with a description of what Control Theory is. She states, \" The classical viewpoint taken in the study of differential equations consisted of the (passive) analysis of the evolution properties displayed by a specific equation, or a class of equations, in response to given data. Control theory, however, injects an active mode of synthesis in the study of differential equations: it seeks to influence their dynamical evolution by selecting and synthesizing suitable data (input functions or control functions) from within a preassigned class, to achieve a predetermined desired outcome or performance.\"[6]/nIn simpler terms, control theory is the ability to influence change in a system, something that changes over time. In order to better understand this concept, it is useful to know a few key phrases. A state is a representation of what the system is currently doing, dynamics is how the state changes, reference is what we want the system to do, an output is the measurements of the system, an input is a control signal, and feedback is the mapping from outputs to inputs. This can be applied to many facets of real-life, especially in various engineering fields that concentrate on the control of changes in their field. A good example of control theory applied to the real world is something as simple as a thermostat. The output in this system is temperature, and the control is turning the dial on or off, or to a higher or lower temperature.[7]/nLasiecka uses this theory to further understand partial differential equations. She attempts to answer the questions of how to take advantage of a model in order to improve the system's performance. This idea is paired her desire to understand mathematical solutions of the problems of well-posedness and regularity, stabilization and stability, and optimal control for finite or infinite horizon problems and existence and uniqueness of associated Riccati equations. In Mathematical Control Theory of Coupled PDEs, Lasiecka studies this concept through waves and hyperbolic models. This book was written in order to \"help engineers and professionals involved in materials science and aerospace engineering to solve fundamental theoretical control problems.

In his first paper in English, in 1969, he studied the relationship between the mixed 0-1 integer linear programming problem and certain quadratic programming problems. In the same year, he published a paper on the relation between zero-sum two-player games and linear programming. In 1972, he published an article in Acta Cybernetica on the solution of non-convex programming problems by the cutting plane method; his PhD thesis also dealt with this topic in 1974./nA series of conference presentations and journal publications preceded his book Nonconvex and Discrete Programming, published in 1978, which for many years was one of the fundamental works on the subject in Hungarian.

Mr. Girvan adds to this suggestion by associating Udo with several other more legitimate discoveries where an author was considered ahead of his time in terms of a scientific theory of some sort that is now established as a mainstream theory but was considered fringe science at the time./nAnother aspect of the deception was that it was very common for pre-20th century mathematicians to spend incredible amounts of time on hand calculations such as a logarithm table or trigonometric functions.

In the summers of 1986, 1987, and 1988, Sokal taught mathematics at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, when the Sandinistas were heading the elected government./nSokal's research lies in mathematical physics and combinatorics. In particular, he studies the interplay between these fields based on questions arising in statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. This includes work on  the chromatic polynomial and the Tutte polynomial, which appear both in algebraic graph theory and in the study of phase transitions in statistical mechanics. His interests include computational physics and algorithms, such as  Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for problems in statistical physics. He also co-authored a book on quantum triviality.[1]/nIn 2013, Sokal co-authored a paper with Nicholas Brown and Harris Friedman, rejecting the Losada Line, a concept popular in positive psychology. Named after its proposer, Marcial Losada, it refers to a critical range for an individual's ratio of positive to negative emotions, outside of which the individual will tend to have poorer life and occupational outcomes.[2] This concept of a critical positivity ratio was highly cited and popularised by psychologists such as Barbara Fredrickson. The trio's paper, published in American Psychologist, contended that the ratio was based on faulty mathematical reasoning and therefore invalid.[3]/nIn 1996, Sokal was curious to see whether the then-non-peer-reviewed postmodern cultural studies journal Social Text (published by Duke University Press) would publish a submission which \"flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions\". Sokal submitted a grand-sounding but completely nonsensical paper titled \"Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity.\"[4][5]/nAfter holding the article back from earlier issues because of Sokal's refusal to consider revisions, the staff published it in the \"Science Wars\" issue as a relevant contribution.[6] Soon thereafter, Sokal then revealed that the article was a hoax in the journal Lingua Franca,[7] arguing that the left and social science would be better served by intellectual underpinnings based on reason. The affair was front-page news in The New York Times on May 18, 1996.

He studied geometry under the instruction of Galilean follower Clemente Settimi.[2]  It was through Clemente that Viviani would gain recognition and meet Clemente's instructor, Tuscan Court mathematician Famiano Michelini.[2]  In 1638, Michelini initiated the Grand Duke Ferdinand II de\u2019 Medici's interest in Viviani and arranged their introduction in Livorno where Viviani would demonstrate his abilities. The Grand Duke offered Viviani a monthly salary to continue his education and introduced him to Galileo, whose deteriorating health required a capable and competent assistant.[2]  Later that year, Viviani was able to expand his knowledge over the philosophy of nature while assisting Galileo on Two new sciences, in which Galileo studied the acceleration of free bodies along an inclined plane.[2] Their frequent exchange over the subject inspired Galileo to elaborate on the mathematical theory and complete his demonstration on free bodies that would establish its connection to nature. Viviani would later use similar applications of mathematics in nature during a collaboration with Nicolaus Steno.[3]/nIn 1639, Viviani moved to Galileo's home in Arcetri to assist him in his studies before they were joined by Evangelista Torricelli in 1641.[4] Apart from being Galileo's disciple, Viviani became a pupil of Evangelista Torricelli and worked on physics and geometry.[1]  Viviani was the last disciple of Galileo until Galileo's death in 1642.[3][5][1]/nAfter Torricelli's 1647 death, Viviani was appointed to fill his position at the Accademia dell'Arte del Disegno in Florence. Viviani was also one of the first members of the Grand Duke's experimental academy, the Accademia del Cimento, when it was created a decade later.[1]/nApart from his own career and endeavors, Viviani worked throughout his life to preserve the contributions and life of Galileo.[4] In 1654, Cardinal Leopoldo de\u2019 Medici tasked Viviani with gathering material in order to write a biography about Galileo's life and work.[6][4] Carlo Manolessi also recruited Viviani to assist him and others in creating a compilation of Galileo's work and coordinating the frontispiece for Galileo's publication.[6]/nFrom 1655 to 1656, Viviani edited the first edition of Galileo's collected works.[1] Viviani tried to publish an account of the life of Galileo, but claimed that his efforts were halted by the Catholic church although this claim has been challenged.[7]/nOne of the primary interests of Viviani was the study of the mathematics of the ancients. Viviani spent much of his life restoring the works of Aristaeus the Elder and Apollonius./nIn 1660, Viviani and Giovanni Alfonso Borelli conducted an experiment to determine the speed of sound.  Timing the difference between the seeing the flash and hearing the sound of a cannon shot at a distance, they calculated a value of 350 meters per second (m/s), considerably better than the previous value of 478\u00a0m/s obtained by Pierre Gassendi.[1] The currently accepted value is 331.29\u00a0m/s at 0\u00a0\u00b0C or 340.29\u00a0m/s at sea level. It has also been claimed that in 1661 he experimented with the rotation of pendulums, 190 years before the famous demonstration by Foucault. Specifically, during experiments with a pendulum, he observed it to veer to one side. He did not make a connection with the rotation of Earth. As it was an unwanted effect, he eliminated it by hanging the pendulum with two ropes.[8][9]/nBy 1666, Viviani started to receive many job offers as his reputation as a mathematician grew. That same year, Louis XIV of France offered him a position at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale and John II Casimir of Poland offered Viviani a post as his astronomer. Fearful of losing Viviani, the Grand Duke appointed him First Mathematician of the Tuscan Court.[2] The position was previously held by Galileo, whose death resulted in Torricelli's appointment to the position, followed by Viviani years after Torricelli's death. Viviani accepted this post and turned down his other offers.[1] From 1666 to 1667, Viviani guided Nicolaus Steno on the geometrical propositions of anatomical figures and dissections of shark muscle fibers.[3] The shark dissection figures in Elementorum myologiae specimen, seu musculi descriptio geometri demonstrated the possible functions of anatomical structures by combining anatomy with geometry while observing muscle contractions.[3]/nIn  1687, he published a book on engineering, Discorso intorno al difendersi da' riempimenti e dalle corrosione de' fiumi.[1]/nUpon his death, Viviani left an almost completed work on the resistance of solids, which was subsequently completed and published by Luigi Guido Grandi.[1]/nIn 1737, the Church finally allowed Galileo to be reburied in a grave with an elaborate monument.  The monument that was created in the church of Santa Croce was constructed with the help of funds left by Viviani for that specific purpose. Viviani's own remains were moved to Galileo's new grave as well.[1]/nThe lunar crater Viviani is named after him./nIn Florence, Viviani had Galileo's life and achievements written in Latin on the fa\u00e7ade of his palace, on huge stone scrolls. The palace was then renamed Palazzo dei Cartelloni.", "752701": "George Whitelaw Mackey (February 1, 1916 \u2013 March 15, 2006) was an American mathematician known for his contributions to quantum logic, representation theory, and noncommutative geometry./nMackey earned his bachelor of arts at Rice University (then the Rice Institute) in 1938 and obtained his Ph.D. at Harvard University in 1942 under the direction of Marshall H.

A central role in Mackey's work, both in the theory of group representations and in mathematical physics, was played by the concepts of system of imprimitivity and induced representations. This idea led naturally to an analysis of the representation theory of semi-direct products in terms of ergodic actions of groups and in some cases a complete classification of such representations. Mackey's results were essential tools in the study of the representation theory of nilpotent Lie groups using the method of orbits developed by Alexandre Kirillov in the 1960s. His notion of \"virtual subgroup\", introduced in 1966 using the language of groupoids, had a significant influence in ergodic theory./nAnother essential ingredient in Mackey's work was the assignment of a Borel structure to  the dual object of a locally compact group (specifically a locally compact separable metric group) G.  One of Mackey's important conjectures, which was eventually solved by work of James Glimm on C*-algebras, was that G is type I (meaning that all its factor representations are of type I) if and only if the Borel structure of its dual is a standard Borel space./nHe has written numerous survey articles connecting his research interests with a large body of mathematics and physics, particularly quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics./nMackey was among the first five recipients of William Lowell Putnam fellowships in 1938.[1] He received the Leroy P.

He was one of the leading intellectuals of the Jansenist group of Port-Royal and had a very thorough knowledge of patristics. Contemporaries called him le Grand to distinguish him from his father./nAntoine Arnauld was born in Paris to the Arnauld family. The twentieth and youngest child of the original Antoine Arnauld, he was originally intended for the bar, but decided instead to study theology at the Sorbonne.  Here he was brilliantly successful, and his career was flourishing when he came under the influence of Jean du Vergier de Hauranne, the spiritual director and leader of the convent of Port-Royal, and was drawn in the direction of Jansenism.[3]/nHis book, De la fr\u00e9quente Communion (1643), was an important step in making the aims and ideals of this movement intelligible to the general public. It attracted controversy by being against frequent communion. Furthermore, in the frame of the controversy around Jansenius' Augustinus, during which the Jesuits attacked the Jansenists claiming they were heretics similar to Calvinists, Arnauld wrote in defense the Th\u00e9ologie morale des J\u00e9suites (Moral Theology of Jesuits), which would put the base of most of the arguments later used by Pascal in his Provincial Letters denouncing the \"relaxed moral\" of Jesuit casuistry.[4] Pascal was assisted in this task by Arnauld's nephew Antoine Le Maistre.[5] The Jesuit Nicolas Caussin, former penitentiary to Louis XIII, was charged by his order of writing a defense against Arnauld's book, titled R\u00e9ponse au libelle intitul\u00e9 La Th\u00e9ologie morale des J\u00e9suites (1644). Other libels published against Arnauld's Moral Theology of Jesuits included the one written by the Jesuit polemist Fran\u00e7ois Pinthereau (1605\u20131664), under the pseudonym of the abb\u00e9 de Boisic, titled Les Impostures et les ignorances du libelle intitul\u00e9: La Th\u00e9ologie Morale des J\u00e9suites (1644), who was also the author of a critical history of Jansenism titled La Naissance du Jans\u00e9nisme d\u00e9couverte \u00e0 Monsieur le Chancelier (The Birth of Jansenism Revealed to Sir the Chancellor, Leuven, 1654).[3]/nDuring the formulary controversy which opposed Jesuits to Jansenists concerning the orthodoxy of Jansenius' propositions, Arnauld was forced to go into hiding. In 1655 two very outspoken Lettres \u00e0 un duc et pair on Jesuit methods in the confessional brought a motion of censorship voted against him in the Sorbonne, in quite an irregular manner. This motion prompted Pascal to anonymously write the Provincial Letters. For more than twenty years Arnauld dared not appear publicly in Paris, hiding in religious retreat.[3]/nPascal, however, failed to save his friend, and in February 1656 Arnauld was ceremonially degraded. Twelve years later the so-called \"peace\" of Pope Clement IX put an end to his troubles; he was graciously received by Louis XIV, and treated almost as a popular hero.[3]/nHe now set to work with Pierre Nicole on a great work against the Calvinist Protestants: La perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9 de la foi de l'\u00c9glise catholique touchant l'eucharistie. Ten years later, however, persecution resumed. Arnauld was compelled to leave France for the Netherlands, finally settling down at Brussels. Here the last sixteen years of his life were spent in incessant controversy with Jesuits, Calvinists and heretics of all kinds. Arnauld gradually evolved away from the rigorous Augustinianism professed by Port-Royal and closer to Thomism, which also postulated the centrality of the \"efficacious grace,\" under the influence of Nicole.[3]/nHis inexhaustible energy is best expressed by his famous reply to Nicole, who complained of feeling tired. \"Tired!\" echoed Arnauld, \"when you have all eternity to rest in?\"[citation needed] His energy was not exhausted by purely theological questions. He was one of the first to adopt the philosophy of Ren\u00e9 Descartes, though with certain orthodox reservations relating to Meditations on First Philosophy; and between 1683 and 1685 he had a long battle with Nicolas Malebranche on the relation of theology to metaphysics. On the whole, public opinion leant to Arnauld's side. When Malebranche complained that his adversary had misunderstood him, Boileau silenced him with the question: \"My dear sir, whom do you expect to understand you, if M. Arnauld does not?\"[citation needed] Next  Arnauld was engaged in an extensive correspondence with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, regarding the latter's views detailed in his \"Discourse on Metaphysics\" (1686).  Arnauld died, aged 82, in Brussels.[3]/nPopular record for Arnauld's penetration was much increased in his L'Art de penser, commonly known as the Port-Royal Logic,[3] which kept its place as an elementary text-book until the 20th century and is considered a paradigmatical work of term logic./nArnauld came to be regarded as important among the mathematicians of his time; one critic described him as the Euclid of the 17th century. After his death, his reputation began to wane. Contemporaries admired him as a master of intricate reasoning; on this, Jacques-B\u00e9nigne Bossuet, the greatest theologian of the age, agreed with Henri Fran\u00e7ois d'Aguesseau, the greatest lawyer.  However, his eagerness to win every argument endeared him to no one.  \"In spite of myself,\" Arnauld once said regretfully, \"my books are seldom very short.\"[citation needed]. Despite Arnauld's achievements in various fields, his name is mostly known because of Pascal's acclaimed writings, which were more fit for the general public than Arnauld's technical essays. Boileau wrote for him a famous epitaph, consecrating his memory as/n\u201cAu pied de cet autel de structure grossi\u00e8re\n G\u00eet sans pompe, enferm\u00e9 dans une vile bi\u00e8re,\n Le plus savant mortel qui jamais ait \u00e9crit;\u201d\n...\n(\u201cAt the foot of this rough structure altar\nLies without pomp, locked in a vile casket,\nThe most learned mortal who ever wrote;\u201d)\n\u2026/nAntoine Arnauld's complete works (thirty-seven volumes in forty-two parts) were published in Paris, 1775\u20131781.

He is professor emeritus of both Meiji University and Tohoku University. He is also distinguished professor of emeritus at Meiji in recognition of achievement over the course of an academic career.  Before he joined Meiji University in 2003, he was professor of mathematics at Nagoya University (1988\u20131991), at the University of Tokyo (1991\u20131993), and at Tohoku University (1993\u20132003). Sunada was involved in the creation of the School of Interdisciplinary Mathematical Sciences at Meiji University and is its first dean (2013\u20132017). Since 2019, he is President of Mathematics Education Society of Japan./nSunada's work covers complex analytic geometry, spectral geometry, dynamical systems, probability, graph theory, discrete geometric analysis, and mathematical crystallography.  Among his numerous contributions, the most famous one is a general construction of isospectral manifolds (1985), which is based on his geometric model of number theory, and is considered to be a breakthrough in the problem proposed by Mark Kac in \"Can one hear the shape of a drum?\" (see Hearing the shape of a drum). Sunada's idea was taken up by Carolyn S. Gordon, David Webb, and Scott A. Wolpert when they constructed a counterexample for Kac's problem. For this work, Sunada was awarded the Iyanaga Prize of the Mathematical Society of Japan (MSJ) in 1987. He was also awarded Publication Prize of MSJ in 2013,  the Hiroshi Fujiwara Prize for Mathematical Sciences in 2017, the Prize for Science and Technology (the Commendation for Science and Technology by the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology) in 2018, and the 1st Kodaira Kunihiko Prize in 2019./nIn a joint work with Atsushi Katsuda, Sunada also established a geometric analogue of Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions in the context of dynamical systems (1988). One can see, in this work as well as the one above, how the concepts and ideas in totally different fields (geometry, dynamical systems, and number theory) are put together to formulate problems and to produce new results./nHis study of discrete geometric analysis includes a graph-theoretic interpretation of Ihara zeta functions, a discrete analogue of periodic magnetic Schr\u00f6dinger operators as well as the large time asymptotic behaviors of random walk on crystal lattices. The study of random walk led him to the discovery of a \"mathematical twin\" of the diamond crystal out of an infinite universe of hypothetical crystals (2005). He named it the K4 crystal due to its mathematical relevance (see the linked article). What was noticed by him is that the K4  crystal has the \"strong isotropy property\", meaning that for any two vertices x and y of the crystal net, and for any ordering of the edges adjacent to x and any ordering of the edges adjacent to y, there is a net-preserving congruence taking x to y and each x-edge to the similarly ordered y-edge. This property is shared only by the diamond crystal \n(the strong isotropy should not be confused with the edge-transitivity or the notion of symmetric graph; for instance, the primitive cubic lattice is a symmetric graph, but not strongly isotropic). The K4 crystal and the diamond crystal as networks in space are examples of \u201cstandard realizations\u201d, the notion introduced by Sunada and Motoko Kotani as a graph-theoretic version of Albanese maps (Abel-Jacobi maps) in algebraic geometry./nFor his work, see also Isospectral, Reinhardt domain, Ihara zeta function, Ramanujan graph, quantum ergodicity, quantum walk.", "38075487": "Italo Jose Dejter (December 17, 1939) is an Argentine-born American mathematician, a retired professor of mathematics and computer science from the University of Puerto Rico, (August 1984-February 2018) and a researcher in algebraic topology, \ndifferential topology, graph theory, coding theory and combinatorial designs.\nHe obtained a Licentiate degree in mathematics from  University of Buenos Aires in 1967, arrived at Rutgers University in 1970 by means of a Guggenheim Fellowship and obtained a Ph.D. degree in mathematics in 1975 under the supervision of Professor Ted Petrie,[1] with support of the National Science Foundation. He was a professor at the\nFederal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil, from 1977 to 1984, with grants from the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, (CNPq)./nDejter has been a visiting scholar at a number of research institutions, including University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Instituto Nacional de Matem\u00e1tica Pura e Aplicada, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul,\nUniversity of Cambridge, National Autonomous University of Mexico, \nSimon Fraser University, University of Victoria, New York University, University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign, McMaster University, DIMACS, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Technical University of Denmark, Auburn University, Polytechnic University of Catalonia, Technical University of Madrid, Charles University, Ottawa University and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar University. The sections below describe the relevance of Dejter's work in the research areas  mentioned in the first paragraph above, or in the adjacent box./nIn 1971, Ted Petrie[2] conjectured that if X is a closed, smooth 2n-dimensional homotopy complex projective space that admits a nontrivial smooth action of the circle,\nand if a function h, mapping  X onto the 2n-dimensional complex projective space, is a homotopy equivalence, then h preserves the Pontrjagin classes. In 1975, Dejter[3] proved Petrie's Conjecture for n=3,\nestablishing this way that every closed, smooth, 6-dimensional homotopy\ncomplex projective space must be the complex 3-dimensional projective space CP3. Dejter's result is most relevant in view of Petrie's exotic S1-actions on CP3,[4] (apart from the trivial S1-actions on CP3)./nLet G be a compact Lie group, let Y be a smooth G-manifold and let F a G-fibre\nmap between G-vector bundles of the same dimension over Y which on each\nG-fibre is proper and has degree one.  Petrie[2] also asked: What are necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a smooth G-map properly G-homotopic to F and transverse to the zero-section? Dejter[5] provided both types of conditions, which do not close to a necessary and sufficient condition due to a counterexample.[5]/nThe main tool involved in establishing the results above by reducing differential-topology problems into algebraic-topology solutions is equivariant algebraic K-theory, where equivariance is understood with respect to the group given by the circle, i.e. the unit circle of the complex plane./nIn 1962, Paul Erd\u0151s and Lajos P\u00f3sa proved that for every positive integer k there exists a positive integer k' such that for every graph G, either (i) G has k vertex-disjoint (long and/or even) cycles or (ii) there exists a subset X of less than k' vertices of G such that G \\ X\nhas no (long and/or even) cycles. This result, known today as the Erd\u0151s\u2013P\u00f3sa theorem, cannot be extended to odd cycles. In fact, in 1987 Dejter and V\u00edctor Neumann-Lara[6] showed that given an integer k > 0, there exists a graph G not possessing disjoint odd cycles such that the number of vertices of G whose removal destroys all odd cycles of G is higher than k./nIn 1993,[7]\nBrouwer, Dejter and Thomassen described an undirected, bipartite graph with 112 vertices and 168 edges, \n(semi-symmetric, that is edge-transitive but not vertex-transitive, cubic graph with diameter 8, radius 7, chromatic number 2, chromatic index 3, girth 10, with exactly 168 cycles of length 10 and 168 cycles of length 12), known since 2002 as the Ljubljana graph. They[7]  also established that the Dejter graph,[8] obtained by deleting a copy\nof the Hamming code of length 7 from the binary\n7-cube, admits a 3-factorization into two copies of the Ljubljana graph. See also.[9][10][11][12][13][14] Moreover, relations of this subject with square-blocking subsets and with perfect dominating sets (see  below) in\nhypercubes were addressed by Dejter et al. since 1991 in,[12][13][14] and .[9]/nIn fact, two questions were answered in,[7] namely:/n(a) How many colors are needed for a coloring of the n-cube without monochromatic 4-cycles or 6-cycles? Brouwer, Dejter and Thomassen[7] showed that 4 colors suffice and thereby settle a problem of Erd\u0151s.[15]\n(Independently found by F.R.K.Chung.[16] Improving on this, Marston Conder[17] in 1993 showed that for all n not less than 3 the edges of the n-cube can be 3-colored in such a way that there is no monochromatic 4-cycle or 6-cycle)./n(b) Which vertex-transitive induced subgraphs does a hypercube have? The Dejter graph mentioned above is 6-regular, vertex-transitive and, as suggested, its edges can be 2-colored so that the two resulting monochromatic subgraphs are isomorphic to the semi-symmetric Ljubljana graph of girth 10./nIn 1972, I. Z. Bouwer[18] attributed a graph with the mentioned properties of the Ljubljana graph to R. M. Foster./nIn 2012, Dejter[19] showed that the 56-vertex Klein cubic graph F{56}B,[20] denoted here \u0393', can be obtained from the 28-vertex Coxeter cubic graph \u0393 by zipping adequately the squares of the 24 7-cycles of \u0393 endowed with an\norientation obtained by considering \u0393 as a \n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {C}}}\n\n-ultrahomogeneous[21] digraph, where \n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {C}}}\n\n is the collection formed both by the oriented 7-cycles and the 2-arcs that tightly\nfasten those oriented 7-cycles in \u0393. In the process, it is seen that\n\u0393' is a C'-ultrahomogeneous (undirected) graph, where C' is the collection formed by both the 7-cycles and the 1-paths that tightly fasten those\n7-cycles in \u0393'. This yields an embedding of \u0393' into a 3-torus T3 which forms the Klein map[22] of Coxeter notation (7,3)8. The dual graph of \u0393' in T3 is the\ndistance-regular Klein quartic graph, with corresponding dual map of Coxeter notation (3,7)8. Other aspects of this work are also cited in the following pages:/nBitangents of a quartic.Coxeter graph.Heawood graph./nIn 2010, Dejter [23] adapted the notion of \n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {C}}}\n\n-ultrahomogeneous graph for digraphs, and presented a strongly connected\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\vec {C}}_{4}}\n\n-ultrahomogeneous oriented graph on 168 vertices and 126 pairwise arc-disjoint 4-cycles with regular indegree and outdegree 3 and no circuits of lengths 2 and 3 by altering a definition of the Coxeter graph via pencils of ordered lines of the Fano plane in which pencils were replaced by ordered pencils./nThe study of ultrahomogeneous graphs (respectively, digraphs) can be\ntraced back to Sheehan,[24]\nGardiner,[25] Ronse,[26]\nCameron,[27] Gol'fand and Klin,[28] (respectively, Fra\u00efss\u00e9,[29] Lachlan and Woodrow,[30] Cherlin[31]). See also page 77 in Bondy and Murty.[32]/nMotivated in 2013[33]  by the study of connected Menger graphs [34] of self-dual 1-configurations (nd)1 [35]\n[36] expressible as Kd-ultrahomogeneous graphs, Dejter wondered for which values of n such graphs exist, as they would yield the most symmetrical, connected, edge-disjoint unions of n copies of Kd on n vertices in which the roles of vertices and copies of Kd are\ninterchangeable. For d=4, known values of n are: n=13,\n21[37][38][39] and n=42,[40] This reference, by Dejter in 2009, yields a graph G for which each isomorphism between two of the 42 copies of K4 or two of the 21 copies of K2,2,2 in G extends to an automorphism of G. While it would be of interest to determine the spectrum and multiplicities of the involved values of n, Dejter[33] contributes the value of n=102 via the Biggs-Smith\nassociation scheme (presented via sextets[41] mod 17), shown to control attachment of 102 (cuboctahedral) copies of the line graph of the 3-cube to the 102 (tetrahedral) copies of K4, these sharing each triangle with two copies of the cuboctahedral copies and guaranteeing that the distance 3-graph of the Biggs-Smith graph is the Menger graph of a self-dual 1-configuration (1024)1.\nThis result[33] was obtained as an application of a transformation of distance-transitive graphs into C-UH graphs that yielded the above-mentioned paper[19] and also allowed to confront,[42] as digraphs, the Pappus graph to the Desargues graph./nThese applications as well as the reference [43] use the following definition.\nGiven a family C of digraphs, a digraph G is said to be\nC-ultrahomogeneous if every isomorphism between two induced members\nof C in G extends to an automorphism of G. In,[43] it\nis shown that exactly 7 distance-transitive cubic graphs among the\nexisting 12 possess a particular ultrahomogeneous property with\nrespect to oriented cycles realizing the girth that allows the\nconstruction of a related Cayley digraph with similar\nultrahomogeneous properties in which those oriented cycles appear\nminimally \"pulled apart\", or \"separated\" and whose description is\ntruly beautiful and insightful./nIn 1983, Dejter[44]  found that an equivalent condition for the existence of a Z4-Hamilton cycle on the graph of chessknight moves of the usual type (1,2),(resp\n(1,4)) on the 2nx2n-board is that n is odd larger than 2, (resp. 4). These results are cited by I. Parberry,[45][46] in relation to the algorithmic aspects of the knight's tour problem./nIn 1985, Dejter[47] presented a construction technique for Hamilton cycles in the middle-levels graphs. The existence of such cycles had been conjectured by I. Havel in 1983.[48] and by M. Buck and D. Wiedemann in 1984,[49] (though B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s presented it to Dejter as a Paul Erd\u0151s' conjecture in Jan. 1983) and established by T. M\u00fctze[50] in 2014. That technique was used by Dejter et al.[51][52][53][54][55][56]/nIn 2014, Dejter[57] returned to this problem and established a canonical ordering of the vertices in a quotient graph (of each middle-levels graph under the action of a dihedral group) in one-to-one correspondence with an initial section of a system of numeration (present as sequence A239903 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences by Neil Sloane)\n[58] composed by restricted growth strings[59][60] (with the k-th Catalan number[61] expressed by means of the string 10...0 with k \"zeros\" and a single \"one\", as J. Arndt does in page 325 [60]) and related to Kierstead-Trotter lexical matching colors.[62] This system of numeration may apply to a dihedral-symmetric restricted version of the middle-levels conjecture./nIn 1988, Dejter[63] showed that for any positive integer n, all 2-covering graphs of the complete graph Kn on n vertices\ncan be determined; in addition, he showed that among them there is only one graph that is connected and has a maximal automorphism group, which happens to be bipartite; Dejter also showed that an i-covering graph of Kn is hamiltonian, for i less than 4, and that properly minimal connected non-hamiltonian covering graphs of Kn are obtained which are 4-coverings\nof Kn; also, non-hamiltonian connected 6-coverings of Kn\nwere constructed in that work./nAlso in 1988, Dejter[64] showed that if k, n and q are integers such that if 0 <2k<n=2kq\n\n\n\n\u00b1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\pm }\n\n1, then the graph generated by the generalized chessknight moves of type (1,2k) on the 2n x 2n-chessboard has Hamilton cycles invariant under quarter turns. For k=1,  respectively 2, this extends to the following necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such cycles: that  n is odd and larger than 2k-1./nIn 1990, Dejter[65] showed that if n and r are integers larger than 0 with n+r larger than 2, then the difference of two concentric square boards A and B with (n + 2r)2 and n2 entries respectively has a chessknight Hamilton cycle invariant under quarter-turns if and only if r is larger than 2 and either n or r is odd./nIn 1991, Dejter and Neumann-Lara[66] showed that given a group Zn acting freely on a graph G, the notion of a voltage graph[67] is applied to the search for Hamilton cycles in G invariant under an action of Zn on G. As an application, for n = 2 and 4, equivalent conditions and lower bounds for chessknight Hamilton cycles containing paths spanning square quadrants and rectangular half-boards were found, respectively./nRecalling that each edge of a graph H has two oppositely oriented arcs, each vertex v of H is identified with the set of arcs (v,e) departing from v along the edges e of H incident to v. Let H be a (\u03bb,\u03bc)-biregular graph with bipartition (Y,X), where |Y|=k\u03bc and |X|=k\u03bb, where k<0, \u03bb and \u03bc are integers. In,[68] Dejter considered the problem of assigning, for each edge e=yx of H, a color given by an element of Y, respectively X, to the arc (y,e), respectively (x,e), so that each color is assigned exactly once in the set of arcs departing from each vertex of H. Furthermore, Dejter set such assignment to fulfill a specific bicolor weight function over a monotonic subset of Y\u00d7X, pointing that this problem applies to the Design of Experiments for Industrial Chemistry, Molecular Biology, Cellular Neuroscience, etc. An algorithmic construction based on biregular graphs with bipartitions given by cyclic-group pairs is also presented in Dejter's work, as well as three essentially different solutions to the Great Circle Challenge Puzzle based on a different biregular graph whose bipartition is formed by the vertices and 5-cycles of the Petersen graph./nA perfect dominating set S of a graph G is a set of vertices of G such that every vertex of G is either in S or is adjacent to exactly one vertex of S. Weichsel[69] showed that a perfect dominating set of the n-cube Qn induces a subgraph of Qn whose components are isomorphic to hypercubes and conjectured that each of these hypercubes has the same dimension. In 1993, Dejter and Weichsel[14] presented the first known cases in which those components have the same dimension but different directions, namely in the 8-cube with components that are 1-cubes formed each by one edge, with the involved edges happening in:/n(a) four different directions, as told by Alexander Felzenbaum to Weichsel in Rehovot, Israel, 1988;/n(b) eight different directions, which involves the Hamming code of length 7, the Heawood graph, the Fano plane and the Steiner triple system of order 7./nThe result of (a) above is immediately extended to perfect dominating sets in cubes of dimensions which are powers of 2 whose components contain each an only edge in half the coordinate direction. On the other hand, in 1991, Dejter and Phelps[70] extended the result of (b) above again to cubes whose dimensions are powers of 2, with components composed each by a unique edge in all coordinate directions. (However, this result is not yet extended to q-ary cubes, as planned by the authors)./nThe Weichsel conjecture[69] was answered in the affirmative by \u00d6sterg\u00e5rd and Weakley,[71] who found a perfect dominating set in the 13-cube whose components are 26 4-cubes and 288 isolated vertices. Dejter and Phelps[72] gave a short and elegant proof of this result./nAn E-chain is a countable family of nested graphs, each of which has\nan efficient dominating set. The Hamming codes in the n-cubes\nprovide a classical example of E-chains. Dejter and Serra[73] gave a constructing tool to produce E-chains of Cayley graphs. This tool was used to construct infinite families of E-chains of Cayley graphs generated by transposition trees of diameter 2 on symmetric groups. These graphs, known as star graphs,[74] had the efficient domination property established by Arumugam and Kala.[75]\nIn contrast, Dejter and O. Tomaiconza[76] showed that there is no efficient dominating set in any Cayley graph generated by a transposition tree of diameter 3. Further study on threaded distance trees and E-sets of star graphs was conducted by Dejter.[77] In 2012, Dejter adapted the results cited above to the case of digraphs.[78] In fact, worst-case efficient dominating sets in digraphs are conceived\nso that their presence in certain strong digraphs corresponds to\nthat of efficient dominating sets in star graphs. The fact that the\nstar graphs form a so-called dense segmental neighborly E-chain[73] is reflected in a corresponding fact for digraphs./nIn 2009,[79] Dejter defined a vertex subset S of a graph G as a\nquasiperfect dominating set in G if each vertex v of G not in S\nis adjacent to dv\u00a0\u2208{1,2} vertices of S, and then\ninvestigated perfect and quasiperfect dominating sets in the regular\ntessellation graph of Schl\u00e4fli symbol {3,6} and in its toroidal\nquotient graphs, yielding the classification of their perfect dominating\nsets and most of their quasiperfect dominating sets S with induced\ncomponents of the form K\u03bd, where\n\u03bd\u00a0\u2208{1,2,3} depends only on S./nInvariants of perfect error-correcting codes were addressed by\nDejter in,[80][81] and Dejter and Delgado[82] in which it\nis shown that a perfect 1-error-correcting code C is 'foldable' over\nits kernel via the Steiner triple systems associated to its\ncodewords. The resulting 'folding' produces a graph invariant for C\nvia Pasch configurations and tensors. Moreover, the invariant is\ncomplete for Vasil'ev codes[83] of length 15 as viewed by F. Hergert,[84] showing the\nexistence of nonadditive propelinear 1-perfect codes,[85][86] and allowing to visualize a propelinear code by means\nof the commutative group formed by its classes mod kernel, as well\nas to generalize the notion of a propelinear code by extending the\ninvolved composition of permutations to a more general group\nproduct./nMotivated by an application problem in computer architecture,\nAraujo, Dejter and Horak[87] introduced\na notion of perfect distance-dominating set, PDDS, in a graph,\nconstituting a generalization of perfect Lee codes,[88]\ndiameter perfect codes,[89] and other codes and dominating\nsets, and thus initiating a systematic study of such vertex sets.\nSome of these sets, related to the motivating application, were constructed, and the\nnon-existence of others was demonstrated. In fact, an extension of the\nlong-standing Golomb-Welch Conjecture,[88] in terms of\nPDDSs, was stated./nAccording to Dejter and Delgado,[90] given a vertex subset S'\nof a side Pm of an m x n grid graph G, the perfect dominating sets\nS in G with S' being the intersection of S with V(Pm) can be\ndetermined via an exhaustive algorithm of running time O(2m+n).\nExtending the algorithm to infinite-grid graphs of width m-1,\nperiodicity makes the binary decision tree prunable into a finite\nthreaded tree, a closed walk of which yields all such sets S. The\ngraphs induced by the complements of such sets S can be codified by\narrays of ordered pairs of positive integers, for the growth and\ndetermination of which a speedier algorithm exists. A recent\ncharacterization of grid graphs having total perfect codes S (i.e. with just 1-cubes as induced components, also called \n1-PDDS[87] and DPL(2,4)[89]), due to Klostermeyer and\nGoldwasser,[91] allowed Dejter and Delgado[90] to show that\nthese sets S are restrictions of only one total perfect code S1 in\nthe planar integer lattice graph, with the extra-bonus that the\ncomplement of S1 yields an aperiodic tiling, like the Penrose\ntiling. In contrast, the parallel, horizontal, total perfect codes\nin the planar integer lattice graph are in 1-1 correspondence with\nthe doubly infinite {0,1}-sequences./nDejter showed[92] that there\nis an uncountable number of parallel total perfect codes in the\nplanar integer lattice graph L; in contrast, there is just\none 1-perfect code, and just one total perfect code in L, the latter code\nrestricting to total perfect codes of rectangular grid graphs\n(which yields an asymmetric, Penrose, tiling of the plane); in\nparticular, Dejter characterized all cycle products Cm x Cn\ncontaining parallel total perfect codes, and the d-perfect and total\nperfect code partitions of L and Cm x Cn, the former having as\nquotient graph the undirected Cayley graphs of the cyclic group of\norder 2d2+2d+1 with generator set {1,2d2}./nIn 2012, Araujo and Dejter[93] made a conjecturing\ncontribution to the classification of lattice-like total perfect\ncodes in n-dimensional integer lattices via pairs (G,F) formed by\nabelian groups G and homomorphisms F from Zn onto G, in the line of the Araujo-Dejter-Horak work cited above.[87]/nSince 1994, Dejter intervened in several projects in \nCombinatorial Designs initially suggested by Alexander Rosa, C.

He was a central figure in the translation of the Greek classics into Latin, a precursor to the Scholastic movement, and, along with Cassiodorus, one of the two leading Christian scholars of the 6th century.[9] The local cult of Boethius in the Diocese of Pavia was sanctioned by the Sacred Congregation of Rites in 1883, confirming the diocese's custom of honouring him on the 23 October.[10]/nBoethius was born in Rome a few years after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. A member of the Anicii family, he was orphaned following the family's sudden decline and was raised by Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus, a later consul. After mastering both Latin and Greek in his youth, Boethius rose to prominence as a statesman during the Ostrogothic Kingdom, becoming a senator by age 25, a consul by age 33, and later chosen as a personal advisor to Theodoric the Great./nIn seeking to reconcile the teachings of Plato and Aristotle with Christian theology, Boethius sought to translate the entirety of the Greek classics for Western scholars. He published numerous transcriptions and commentaries of the works of Nicomachus, Porphyry, and Cicero, among others, and wrote extensively on matters concerning music, mathematics, and theology. Though his translations were unfinished following an untimely death, it is largely due to them that the works of Aristotle survived into the Renaissance./nDespite his successes as a senior official, Boethius became deeply unpopular among other members of the Ostrogothic court for denouncing the extensive corruption prevalent among other members of government. After publicly defending fellow consul Caecina Albinus from charges of conspiracy, he was imprisoned by Theodoric around the year 523. While jailed Boethius wrote On the Consolation of Philosophy\u2014a philosophical treatise on fortune, death, and other issues\u2014which became one of the most influential and widely reproduced works of the Early Middle Ages. He was tortured and executed in 524,[11] becoming a martyr in the Christian faith by tradition.[note 2][note 3]/nBoethius was born in Rome to a patrician family c.\u2009480,[18] but the exact date of his birth is unknown.[8] His birth family, the Anicii, was a notably wealthy and influential gens that included emperors Petronius Maximus and Olybrius, in addition to many consuls.[19] However, in the years prior to Boethius' birth, the family had lost much of its influence. The grandfather of Boethius, a senator by the same name, was appointed as praetorian prefect of Italy but died in 454 during the palace plot against Flavius Aetius.[20][21] Boethius' father, Manlius Boethius, who was appointed consul in 487, died while Boethius was still young.[22] Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus, another patrician, adopted and raised him instead, introducing to him philosophy and literature.[23] As a sign of their good relationship, Boethius would later marry his foster-father's daughter, Rusticiana, with whom he would have two children also named Symmachus and Boethius.[24]/nHaving been adopted into the wealthy Symmachi family, Boethius had access to tutors that would have educated him during his youth.[25] Though Symmachus had some fluency in Greek, Boethius achieved a mastery of the language\u2014an increasingly rare skill in the Western regions of the Empire\u2014and dedicated his early career to translating the entire works of Plato and Aristotle,[26][27] with some of the translations that he produced being the only surviving transcriptions of Greek texts into the Middle Ages.[28][29] The unusual fluency of Boethius in the Greek language has led some scholars to believe that he was educated in the East; a traditional view, first proposed by Edward Gibbon, is that Boethius studied in Athens for eighteen years based on the letters of Cassiodorus, though this was likely to have been a misreading by past historians.[25][note 4]/nHistorian Pierre Courcelle has argued that Boethius studied at Alexandria with the Neoplatonist philosopher Ammonius Hermiae. However, Historian John Moorhead observes that the evidence supporting Boethius having studied in Alexandria is \"not as strong as it may appear,\" adding that he may have been able to acquire his formidable learning without travelling.[31] Whatever the case, Boethius' fluency in Greek proved useful throughout his life in translating the classic works of Greek thinkers, though his interests spanned across a variety of fields including music, mathematics, astrology, and theology.[32]/nTaking inspiration from Plato's Republic, Boethius left his scholarly pursuits to enter the service of Theodoric the Great.[33] The two had first met in the year 500 when Theodoric traveled to Rome to stay for six months.[34] Though no record survives detailing the early relationship between Theodoric and Boethius, it is clear that the Ostrogothic king viewed him favorably. In the next few years, Boethius rapidly ascended through the ranks of government, becoming a senator by age 25 and a consul by the year 510.[18][35] His earliest documented acts on behalf of the Ostrogothic ruler were to investigate allegations that the paymaster of Theodoric's bodyguards had debased the coins of their pay, to produce a waterclock for Theodoric to gift to king Gundobad of the Burgundians, and to recruit a lyre-player to perform for Clovis, King of the Franks.[36]/nBoethius writes in the Consolation that, despite his own successes, he believed that his greatest achievement came when both his sons were selected by Theodoric to be consuls in 522, with each representing the whole of the Roman Empire.[37] The appointment of his sons was an exceptional honor, not only since it made conspicuous Theodoric's favor for Boethius, but also because the Byzantine emperor Justin I had forfeited his own nomination as a sign of goodwill, thus also endorsing Boethius' sons.[38] In the same year as the appointment of his sons, Boethius was elevated to the position of magister officiorum, becoming the head of all government and palace affairs.[38] Recalling the event, he wrote that he was sitting \"between the two consuls as if it were a military triumph, [letting my] largesse fulfill the wildest expectations of the people packed in their seats around [me].\"[39]/nBoethius' struggles came within a year of his appointment as magister officiorum: in seeking to mend the rampant corruption present in the Roman Court, he writes of having to thwart the conspiracies of Triguilla, the steward of the royal house; of confronting the Gothic minister, Cunigast, who went to \"devour the substance of the poor\"; and of having to use the authority of the king to stop a shipment of food from Campania which, if carried, would have exacerbated an ongoing famine in the region.[40] These actions made Boethius an increasingly unpopular figure among court officials, though he remained in Theodoric's favor.[41]/nThe young philosopher Boethius, a man whose varied accomplishments adorned the middle period of the reign of Theodoric, and whose tragic death was to bring sadness over its close./n\u2014Thomas Hodgkin, Theodoric the Goth[42]/nIn 520, Boethius was working to revitalize the relationship between the Roman See and the Constantinopolitan See\u2014though the two were then still a part of the same Church, disagreements had begun to emerge between them. This may have set in place a course of events that would lead to loss of royal favour.[43] Five hundred years later, this continuing disagreement led to the East\u2013West Schism in 1054, in which communion between the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church was broken.\nIn 523, Boethius fell from power. After a period of imprisonment in Pavia for what was deemed a treasonable offence, he was executed in 524.[18][44] The primary sources are in general agreement over the facts of what happened. At a meeting of the Royal Council in Verona, the referendarius Cyprianus accused the ex-consul Caecina Decius Faustus Albinus of treasonous correspondence with Justin I. Boethius leapt to his defense, crying, \"The charge of Cyprianus is false, but if Albinus did that, so also have I and the whole senate with one accord done it; it is false, my Lord King.\"[45]/nCyprianus then also accused Boethius of the same crime and produced three men who claimed they had witnessed the crime. Boethius and Basilius were arrested. First the pair were detained in the baptistery of a church, then Boethius was exiled to the Ager Calventianus, a distant country estate, where he was put to death. Not long afterwards Theodoric had Boethius' father-in-law Symmachus put to death, according to Procopius, on the grounds that he and Boethius together were planning a revolution, and confiscated their property.[46] \"The basic facts in the case are not in dispute,\" writes Jeffrey Richards. \"What is disputed about this sequence of events is the interpretation that should be put on them.\"[47] Boethius claims his crime was seeking \"the safety of the Senate\". He describes the three witnesses against him as dishonorable: Basilius had been dismissed from Royal service for his debts, while Venantius Opilio and Gaudentius had been exiled for fraud.[48] However, other sources depict these men in a far more positive light. For example, Cassiodorus describes Cyprianus and Opilio as \"utterly scrupulous, just and loyal\" and mentions they are brothers and grandsons of the consul Opilio.[49]/nTheodoric was feeling threatened by international events. The Acacian schism had been resolved, and the Nicene Christian aristocrats of his kingdom were seeking to renew their ties with Constantinople. The Catholic Hilderic had become king of the Vandals and had put Theodoric's sister Amalafrida to death,[50] and Arians in the East were being persecuted.[51] Then there was the matter that with his previous ties to Theodahad, Boethius apparently found himself on the wrong side in the succession dispute following the untimely death of Eutharic, Theodoric's announced heir./nBoethius, the most learned man of his time, met his death in the hangman's noose...and yet the life of Boethius was a triumph! The West owes this individual, Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius, nothing less than its progression toward a culture of reason./n\u2014Johannes Fried, The Middle Ages[52]/nThe method of Boethius' execution varies in the sources. He may have been beheaded, clubbed to death, or hanged.[52] It is likely that he was tortured with a rope that was constricted around his head, bludgeoned until his eyes bulged out; then his skull was cracked.[53][54] Following an agonizing death, his remains were entombed in the church of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro in Pavia, also the resting place of Augustine of Hippo. His wealth was also confiscated, and his wife, Rusticiana, reduced to poverty.[28]/nPast historians have had a hard time accepting a sincere Christian who was also a serious Hellenist.[28][55] These worries have largely stemmed by the lack of any mention of Jesus in Boethius' Consolation, nor of any other Christian figure.[56] Arnaldo Momigliano argues that \"Boethius turned to paganism. His Christianity collapsed\u2014it collapsed so thoroughly that perhaps he did not even notice its disappearance.\" However, the majority of scholarship has taken a different view,[57] with Arthur Herman writing that Boethius was \"unshakably Orthodox Catholic,\" and Thomas Hodgkin having asserted that uncovered manuscripts \"prove beyond a doubt that Boethius was a Christian.\"[58][56]  Furthermore, the community that he was a part of valued equally both classical and Christian culture.[59]/nBoethius's best known work is the Consolation of Philosophy (De consolatione philosophiae), which he wrote at the very end of his career, awaiting his execution in prison. This work represented an imaginary dialogue between himself and philosophy, with philosophy personified as a woman, arguing that despite the apparent inequality of the world, there is, in Platonic fashion, a higher power and everything else is secondary to that divine Providence.[60]/nSeveral manuscripts survived and these were widely edited, translated and printed throughout the late 15th century and later in Europe.[61] Beyond Consolation of Philosophy, his lifelong project was a deliberate attempt to preserve ancient classical knowledge, particularly philosophy. Boethius intended to translate all the works of Aristotle and Plato from the original Greek into Latin.[62][63][64]/nHis completed translations of Aristotle's works on logic were the only significant portions of Aristotle available in Latin Christendom from the sixth century until the rediscovery of Aristotle in the 12th century. However, some of his translations (such as his treatment of the topoi in The Topics) were mixed with his own commentary, which reflected both Aristotelian and Platonic concepts.[65]/nThe commentaries themselves have been lost.[66] In addition to his commentary on the Topics, Boethius composed two treatises on Topical argumentation, In Ciceronis Topica and De topicis differentiis. The first work has six books, and is largely a response to Cicero's Topica.[67] The first book of In Ciceronis Topica begins with a dedication to Patricius. It includes distinctions and assertions important to Boethius's overall philosophy, such as his view of the role of philosophy as \"establish[ing] our judgment concerning the governing of life\",[68] and definitions of logic from Plato, Aristotle and Cicero. He breaks logic into three parts: that which defines, that which divides, and that which deduces.[68]/nHe asserts that there are three types of arguments: those of necessity, of ready believability, and sophistry.[69] He follows Aristotle in defining one sort of Topic as the maximal proposition, a proposition which is somehow shown to be universal or readily believable.[70] The other sort of Topic, the differentiae, are \"Topics that contain and include the maximal propositions\"; means of categorizing the Topics which Boethius credits to Cicero.[71]/nBook\u00a0II covers two kinds of topics: those from related things and those from extrinsic topics. Book\u00a0III discusses the relationship among things studied through Topics, Topics themselves, and the nature of definition. Book\u00a0IV analyzes partition, designation and relationships between things (such as pairing, numbering, genus, and species, etc.). After a review of his terms, Boethius spends Book\u00a0V discussing Stoic logic and Aristotelian causation. Book\u00a0VI relates the nature of the Topic to causes./nIn Topicis Differentiis has four books; Book\u00a0I discusses the nature of rhetorical and dialectical Topics together, Boethius's overall purpose being \"to show what the Topics are, what their differentiae are, and which are suited for what syllogisms.\"[72] He distinguishes between argument (that which constitutes belief) and argumentation (that which demonstrates belief). Propositions are divided into three parts: those that are universal, those that are particular, and those that are somewhere in between.[73] These distinctions, and others, are applicable to both types of Topical argument, rhetorical and dialectical. Books\u00a0II and III are primarily focused on Topics of dialectic (syllogisms), while Book\u00a0IV concentrates on the unit of the rhetorical Topic, the enthymeme. Topical argumentation is at the core of Boethius's conception of dialectic, which \"have categorical rather than conditional conclusions, and he conceives of the discovery of an argument as the discovery of a middle term capable of linking the two terms of the desired conclusion.\"[74]/nNot only are these texts of paramount importance to the study of Boethius, they are also crucial to the history of topical lore. It is largely due to Boethius that the Topics of Aristotle and Cicero were revived, and the Boethian tradition of topical argumentation spans its influence throughout the Middle Ages and into the early Renaissance: \"In the works of Ockham, Buridan, Albert of Saxony, and the Pseudo-Scotus, for instance, many of the rules of consequence bear a strong resemblance to or are simply identical with certain Boethian Topics\u00a0... Boethius's influence, direct and indirect, on this tradition is enormous.\"[75]/nIt was also in De Topicis Differentiis that Boethius made a unique contribution to the discourse on dialectic and rhetoric. Topical argumentation for Boethius is dependent upon a new category for the topics discussed by Aristotle and Cicero, and \"[u]nlike Aristotle, Boethius recognizes two different types of Topics. First, he says, a Topic is a maximal proposition (maxima propositio), or principle; but there is a second kind of Topic, which he calls the differentia of a maximal proposition.[76] Maximal propositions are \"propositions [that are] known per se, and no proof can be found for these.\"[77]/nThis is the basis for the idea that demonstration (or the construction of arguments) is dependent ultimately upon ideas or proofs that are known so well and are so fundamental to human understanding of logic that no other proofs come before it. They must hold true in and of themselves. According to Stump, \"the role of maximal propositions in argumentation is to ensure the truth of a conclusion by ensuring the truth of its premises either directly or indirectly.\"[78]These propositions would be used in constructing arguments through the Differentia, which is the second part of Boethius' theory. This is \"the genus of the intermediate in the argument.\"[79] So maximal propositions allow room for an argument to be founded in some sense of logic while differentia are critical for the demonstration and construction of arguments./nBoethius' definition of \"differentiae\" is that they are \"the Topics of arguments\u00a0... The Topics which are the Differentiae of [maximal] propositions are more universal than those propositions, just as rationality is more universal than man.\"[80] This is the second part of Boethius' unique contribution to the field of rhetoric. Differentia operate under maximal propositions to \"be of use in finding maximal propositions as well as intermediate terms,\" or the premises that follow maximal propositions.[81]/nThough Boethius is drawing from Aristotle's Topics, Differentiae are not the same as Topics in some ways. Boethius arranges differentiae through statements, instead of generalized groups as Aristotle does. Stump articulates the difference. They are \"expressed as words or phrases whose expansion into appropriate propositions is neither intended nor readily conceivable\", unlike Aristotle's clearly defined four groups of Topics. Aristotle had hundreds of topics organized into those four groups, whereas Boethius has twenty-eight \"Topics\" that are \"highly ordered among themselves.\"[82] This distinction is necessary to understand Boethius as separate from past rhetorical theories./nMaximal propositions and Differentiae belong not only to rhetoric, but also to dialectic. Boethius defines dialectic through an analysis of \"thesis\" and hypothetical propositions. He claims that \"[t]here are two kinds of questions. One is that called, 'thesis' by the [Greek] dialecticians. This is the kind of question which asks about and discusses things stripped of relation to other circumstances; it is the sort of question dialecticians most frequently dispute about\u2014for example, 'Is pleasure the greatest good?' [or] 'Should one marry?'.[83]\" Dialectic has \"dialectical topics\" as well as \"dialectical-rhetorical topics\", all of which are still discussed in De Topicis Differentiis.[76] Dialectic, especially in Book\u00a0I, comprises a major component of Boethius' discussion on Topics./nBoethius planned to completely translate Plato's Dialogues, but there is no known surviving translation, if it was actually ever begun.[84]/nBoethius chose to pass on the great Greco-Roman culture to future generations by writing manuals on music, astronomy, geometry and arithmetic.[85]/nSeveral of Boethius' writings, which were hugely influential during the Middle Ages, drew on the thinking of Porphyry and Iamblichus.[86] Boethius wrote a commentary on the Isagoge by Porphyry,[87] which highlighted the existence of the problem of universals: whether these concepts are subsistent entities which would exist whether anyone thought of them, or whether they only exist as ideas. This topic concerning the ontological nature of universal ideas was one of the most vocal controversies in medieval philosophy./nBesides these advanced philosophical works, Boethius is also reported to have translated important Greek texts on the topics of the quadrivium[84] His loose translation of Nicomachus's treatise on arithmetic (De institutione arithmetica libri duo) and his textbook on music (De institutione musica libri quinque, unfinished) contributed to medieval education.[87] De arithmetica begins with modular arithmetic, such as even and odd, evenly even, evenly odd, and oddly even. He then turns to unpredicted complexity by categorizing numbers and parts of numbers.[88] His translations of Euclid on geometry and Ptolemy on astronomy,[89] if they were completed, no longer survive. Boethius made Latin translations of Aristotle's De interpretatione and Categories with commentaries.[43] In his article The Ancient Classics in the Mediaeval Libraries, James Stuart Beddie cites Boethius as the reason Aristotle's works were popular in the Middle Ages, as Boethius preserved many of the philosopher's works.[90]/nBoethius' De institutione musica was one of the first musical texts to be printed in Venice between the years of 1491 and 1492. It was written toward the beginning of the sixth century and helped medieval theorists during the ninth century and onwards understand ancient Greek music.[91] Like his Greek predecessors, Boethius believed that arithmetic and music were intertwined, and helped to mutually reinforce the understanding of each, and together exemplified the fundamental principles of order and harmony in the understanding of the universe as it was known during his time.[92]/nIn De Musica, Boethius introduced the threefold classification of music:[93]/nIn De musica I.2, Boethius describes 'musica instrumentis' as music produced by something under tension (e.g., strings), by wind (e.g., aulos), by water, or by percussion (e.g., cymbals). Boethius himself does not use the term 'instrumentalis', which was used by Adalbold II of Utrecht (975\u20131026) in his Epistola cum tractatu.[full citation needed] The term is much more common in the 13th century and later.[citation needed] It is also in these later texts that musica instrumentalis is firmly associated with audible music in general, including vocal music. Scholars have traditionally assumed that Boethius also made this connection, possibly under the header of wind instruments (\"administratur\u00a0... aut spiritu ut tibiis\"[note 5][94]), but Boethius himself never writes about \"instrumentalis\" as separate from \"instrumentis\" explicitly in his very brief description./nIn one of his works within De institutione musica, Boethius said that \"music is so naturally united with us that we cannot be free from it even if we so desired.\"[95]\nDuring the Middle Ages, Boethius was connected to several texts that were used to teach liberal arts. Although he did not address the subject of trivium, he did write many treatises explaining the principles of rhetoric, grammar, and logic. During the Middle Ages, his works of these disciplines were commonly used when studying the three elementary arts.[89] The historian R. W. Southern called Boethius \"the schoolmaster of medieval Europe.\"[96]/nAn 1872 German translation of \"De Musica\" was the magnum opus of Oscar Paul.[97][non-primary source needed]/nBoethius also wrote Christian theological treatises, which supported Catholicism and condemned Arianism and other heterodox forms of Christianity.[98]/nFive theological works are known:[99]/nHis theological works played an important part during the Middle Ages in philosophical thought, including the fields of logic, ontology, and metaphysics.[102]/nDates of composition:[103]/nEdward Kennard Rand dubbed Boethius the \"last of the Roman philosophers and the first of the scholastic theologians\".[105] Despite the use of his mathematical texts in the early universities, it is his final work, the Consolation of Philosophy, that assured his legacy in the Middle Ages and beyond. This work is cast as a dialogue between Boethius himself, at first bitter and despairing over his imprisonment, and the spirit of philosophy, depicted as a woman of wisdom and compassion. \"Alternately composed in prose and verse,[86] the Consolation teaches acceptance of hardship in a spirit of philosophical detachment from misfortune\".[106]/nParts of the work are reminiscent of the Socratic method of Plato's dialogues, as the spirit of philosophy questions Boethius and challenges his emotional reactions to adversity. The work was translated into Old English by King Alfred and later into English by Chaucer and Queen Elizabeth.[98] Many manuscripts survive and it was extensively edited, translated and printed throughout Europe from the 14th century onwards.[107]/n\"The Boethian Wheel\" is a model for Boethius' belief that history is a wheel,[108] a metaphor that Boethius uses frequently in the Consolation; it remained very popular throughout the Middle Ages, and is still often seen today. As the wheel turns, those who have power and wealth will turn to dust; men may rise from poverty and hunger to greatness, while those who are great may fall with the turn of the wheel. It was represented in the Middle Ages in many relics of art depicting the rise and fall of man. Descriptions of \"The Boethian Wheel\" can be found in the literature of the Middle Ages from the Romance of the Rose to Chaucer.[109]/nDe topicis differentiis was the basis for one of the first works of logic in a western European vernacular, a selection of excerpts translated into Old French by John of Antioch in 1282.[110]/nBoethius was regarded as a Christian martyr by those who lived in succeeding centuries after his death.[17][9] Currently, he is recognized as a saint and martyr for the Catholic faith.[53] He is included within the Roman Martyrology, though to Watkins \"his status as martyr is dubious\".[111] His cult is held in Pavia, where Boethius' status as a saint was confirmed in 1883, and in the Church of Santa Maria in Portico in Rome.

Ryska worked from 1976 to 1992 as an employee of Nixdorf Computer AG in the R&D department. Until 1996 as managing director and project manager on behalf of the Nixdorf Foundations mainly responsible for the construction of the Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum (HNF). From 1996 to 2013, Ryska was the managing director for the museum and technology departments of the HNF./nRyska was born in Hau on the Lower Rhine in 1948, the son of the technician and operating engineer Ferdinand Ryska. He attended high school in Kleve. After graduating from high school in 1967, he completed his military service, e.g. in the communications center of the 1st Corps of the German Armed Forces in M\u00fcnster where he learned how to use encryption technology. In the winter semester of 1968/69, Ryska studied English and Romance languages in M\u00fcnster and from the summer of 1969 he continued his studies in philology for three further terms at Bonn University. From the winter semester of 1970/71 he studied mathematics and computer science. The mathematician Friedrich Hirzebruch was one of his professors. In the summer of 1976, Ryska received a diploma in mathematics. During his studies he had part-time jobs for Inter Nationes, the German Bundestag and the Reuters news agency.[1]/nOn November 1, 1976, Ryska joined Nixdorf Computer AG (NCAG) in Paderborn. His most important work in the years that followed was a security system for ATMs. He was then responsible for the coordination of national and European funding projects in the NCAG Research and Development department and was responsible for public relations.[2]/nAfter the merger of NCAG with the data and information technology division of Siemens AG to form Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG (SNI) on October 1, 1990, Ryska continued to oversee funding projects at the SNI.[3] From April 1, 1992, he worked on the project of a computer museum. The Westphalia Foundation, founded by Heinz Nixdorf, appointed Norbert Ryska to the project team for a computer museum in 1992.[4] On April 1, 1993, he became managing director of the non-profit Forum f\u00fcr Informationstechnik GmbH.[5]/nWith the exhibition designer Ludwig Th\u00fcrmer and the architect Gerhard Diel, Ryska completed the transformation of the NCAG headquarters into the Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum.[6] He led the team that selected exhibits and created texts, images and films. When it opened on October 24, 1996, he was one of the two managing directors alongside Theodor Rode and was responsible for the permanent exhibition, the media department and technical staff. From 1997 to 2017, his co-managing director Kurt Beiersd\u00f6rfer was responsible for marketing, events and museum education as well as for several special exhibitions.[7]/nTogether with Wolfgang Back (WDR), Ryska realized three WDR computer nights at the HNF in 1998, 1999 and 2001.[8] In 2001, Ryska created a section on the history of cryptology;[9] in 2004 he created a cryptology archive. In 2002 he initiated the multimedia presentation \u201cWall of Fame\u201d, which was finished in 2004.[10] In the same year, Ryska was able to convince the Nixdorf Foundation Board for his concept of an extensive expansion and update of the permanent exhibition to acquire and implement the areas of  \"Interfaces-Kommunikation mit der Maschine\" (\"interface communication with the machine\"), \"K\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz und Robotik\" (\"artificial intelligence and robotics\"), \"Mobile Kommunikation\" (\"mobile communication\"), \"Digitale Welt\" (\"digital world\"), \"Showroom \u2013 Technik von morgen\" (\"showroom \u2013 technology of tomorrow\"). In 2007, Ryska and the HNF participated in the Bletchley Park Computer Museum's Cipher Event.[11][12] In the same year he created an exhibition on software and computer science.

In cooperation and consultation with more than 100 national and international experts (from science, technology, education, design and politics, including Rolf Oberliesen), he tried to combine the development and design of a museum with a public forum, for which previously there have been no models worldwide in relation to existing modern technology or company museums.[1]/nHe took on the task of combining the design and implementation of this still vague founding idea for a museum, consisting of existing technical artefacts (special information and communication technology collections) with an open forum. He led a difficult conceptual coordination process between previous company interests and public ideas and social demands.

Despite being entirely self-taught he worked up his own system of conic sections and began to establish himself as a teacher of mathematics, often spending two or three months at a time in the houses of his pupils./nWhat began as a purely local reputation spread quickly, from 1756, when three young men, including the future physician John Haygarth, and Adam Sedgwick's father, Richard Sedgwick, read with him before going up to Cambridge. But the profession on which Dawson embarked was that of a surgeon. In this he was influenced by Henry Bracken, the eminent Lancaster surgeon, with whom he worked as an assistant and pupil. For a year, back in Sedbergh, he practised as a surgeon and then, with his accumulated savings of \u00a3100 stitched in his clothing, walked to Edinburgh to study medicine and mathematics. Despite his frugality he could not stay long enough to take a degree and he returned to Sedbergh to resume his practice and save in preparation for another austere period of study, this time in London. His stay in the capital was brief, but he gained experience in the London hospitals, attended surgical and medical lectures, and made a contact, with Edward Waring, the Lucasian professor of mathematics at Cambridge, that was to be important for his future work as a mathematician. Returning to Sedbergh with a diploma, he made his general practice the best in the north-western dales and soon enjoyed security, even prosperity./nOn 3 March 1767 he married Ann Thirnbeck of Middleton, near Sedbergh. The one daughter of the marriage, Mary, born on 15 January 1768, was to be an important companion to Dawson in his later years, following the death of his wife in 1812./nFor over twenty years Dawson maintained his medical practice while also pursuing his work as a mathematician, and it was only from about 1790 that he devoted himself exclusively to mathematical teaching. By then his fame as a teacher was attracting a regular stream of pupils, including Cambridge undergraduates who read with him during the long vacation and others who were preparing for entry to the university. For a fee of about 5 shillings a week for unlimited tuition, in addition to the cost of accommodation and food, sometimes in Dawson's house but more commonly in a local inn, pupils were taught in a characteristic peripatetic fashion. As Adam Sedgwick, who read with him in 1804 before going up to Cambridge and subsequently during vacations, recalled, Dawson would seat his pupils, often a dozen or more, at tables about the house and move constantly from one to another, correcting and advising. Dawson's method achieved remarkable results. Between 1781 and 1794, at least seven, possibly eight, of the fourteen senior wranglers at Cambridge had been taught by him, as had four others between 1797 and 1807. Among these were the future chancery barrister John Bell, the Arabist John Palmer, the lawyer and anti-slavery campaigner Thomas Harrison, James Inman, who went on to become professor of mathematics at the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, and George Butler, later headmaster of Harrow and dean of Peterborough, whose vivid account of the journey of almost five days between London and Sedbergh and his introduction to Dawson was published in The Sedberghian for December 1881. Pupils who went on to Cambridge and did not achieve the rank of senior wrangler included, in addition to Richard and Adam Sedgwick and Haygarth, the lord chief justice Sir Nicholas Conyngham Tindal, the mathematician Miles Bland, who was at Sedbergh School, and several bishops. Among those whose medical interests took them to Edinburgh rather than Cambridge were Robert Willan, Thomas Garnett, and George Birkbeck./nDawson maintained his active engagement in mathematics into his seventies. But from 1812, with his memory and physical strength failing, he took no further pupils. An anonymous correspondent writing from Trinity College, Cambridge, in the European Magazine urged the university to recognize his status as the first mathematician of England by awarding him an honorary degree. But his original contributions to mathematics were not numerous, and  the only formal honour they brought him was election as a corresponding member of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society./nHis earliest and most substantial publication was his Four Propositions,[2] which appeared anonymously in 1769 in an edition that was largely destroyed by fire. In it Dawson identified errors in the calculation that had led Matthew Stewart, the professor of mathematics at Edinburgh, to overestimate the distance between the Earth and the Sun by more than a quarter. He pursued his argument vigorously when he was attacked by Samuel Horsley in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society; his reply in the Gentleman's Magazine (40, 1770, pp.\u00a0452\u20133[3]) made no concessions and reinforced the respect in which he was held by several Edinburgh mathematicians and natural philosophers, including John Playfair, Lord Webb Seymour, and Henry Lord Brougham, all of whom visited him in Sedbergh. By comparison with Four Propositions his other mathematical publications were slight. The most important of them was a series of rather combative letters signed \u2018Wadson\u2019 and published in Charles Hutton's Miscellanea Mathematica,[4] in which he criticized a paper by Charles Wildbore on the velocity of water emerging from vessels in motion (this exchange is dated to 1773 and 1774;[5] the parts of Miscellanea Mathematica were gathered in a volume with title=page year, 1775). An earlier exchange, in which Dawson took the side of Thomas Simpson against William Emerson, by offering an independent analytical demonstration of the existence of an error in Newton's treatment of precession, passed off less agreeably, with Emerson disabusing Dawson\nas roundly as he had Simpson, according to the report in Life and Letters of the Reverend Adam Sedgwick.[6]/nDawson's interests also embraced metaphysics and theology, subjects that he explored in correspondence with a favourite early pupil, the Rev. Thomas Wilson, headmaster of the grammar schools first in Slaidburn and then in Clitheroe. Described by Adam Sedgwick as \u2018a firm believer and a good sober practical Christian of the old school\u2019, Dawson abhorred the doctrines of David Hume and applauded James Beattie's attack on Humean scepticism. In a similar spirit he wrote against Joseph Priestley's The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity (1777), which he regarded as immoral in tendency and false. His 24-page pamphlet outlining his views on the damaging consequences and unsure foundations of an acceptance of determinism, The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Briefly Invalidated (1781), elicited a dismissive, unsigned rejoinder in the Monthly Review (65, 1781, pp.\u00a066\u20138), which he answered in an appendix to a second edition of the work in 1803. Although Dawson is said to have retained the respect of Priestley and his other adversaries, his contribution lacked the sophistication that the debate demanded at the highest level and it made little lasting mark./nThe impact that Dawson had on those who knew him was heightened by a commanding physical presence well conveyed in the portraits that survive of him. The original of one of the portraits, painted by Joseph Allen in 1809 and showing Dawson teaching a seated pupil, had already been lost by the mid-nineteenth century, but it survived in the form of a copy by the vicar of Sedbergh, the Revd D. M. Peacock, and an engraving by W. W. Barney. The other, a watercolour painted by William Westall in 1817 of a sombre and very elderly Dawson, went to private hands. Striking though Dawson's appearance was, however, he was revered above all for his simplicity of manner and a cheerful, benevolent temperament that left him, in Adam Sedgwick's words, \u2018without any stiffness or affectation of superiority\u2019./nHe died, on 19 September 1820, and a monument high in the nave of St Andrew's Church in Sedbergh was erected, in the form of a bust of him by Robert William Sievier, with an inscription, dated August 1825, by his former pupil John Bell.", "45284500": "Professor John C.

Lepaute along with Alexis Clairaut and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalande calculated the date of the return of Halley's Comet. Her other astronomical feats include calculating the 1764 solar eclipse and producing almanacs from 1759 to 1783. She was also a member of the Scientific Acad\u00e9mie de B\u00e9ziers\u00a0[fr]./nThe asteroid 7720 Lepaute is named in her honour, as is the lunar crater Lepaute./nNicole-Reine Lepaute was born on 5 January 1723 in the Luxembourg Palace in Paris as the daughter of Jean \u00c9table, valet in the service of Louise \u00c9lisabeth d'Orl\u00e9ans.[1] Her father had worked for the royal family for a long time, both in the service of the duchess de Berry and her sister Louise.[2] Louise Elizabeth of Orleans is a widow of Louis of Spain. When her husband died, she returned to Paris and was given part of Luxembourg to live in and to house her staff members.^ She was the sixth of nine children. As a child she was described as precocious and intelligent, being mostly self-taught. She stayed up all night \"devouring\" books and read every book in the library,[2] with J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalande saying of her that even as a child \"she had too much spirit not to be curious\".[3][4] Lepaute\u2019s interest in astronomy had begun at a young age when she most likely witnessed a comet in the sky. She became eager to learn about it and started her curiosity journey when she started studying about comets. This led to one of the biggest discoveries of her time.^/nIn August 1748, she married Jean-Andr\u00e9 Lepaute, a royal clockmaker in the Luxembourg Palace.[3][1][2][4]/nHer marriage gave her the freedom to exercise her scientific skill.[5][6] At the same time as she kept the household's accounts,[4][5] she studied astronomy, mathematics, and \"she observed, she calculated, and she described the inventions of her husband\".[3]/nShe met J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalande, with whom she would work for thirty years, in 1753 when he was called as a representative of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences to inspect her husband's work on a pendulum of a new type. The three of them worked together on a book titled Trait\u00e9 d'horlogerie (Treatise of Clockmaking) that was published in 1755 under her husband's name.[1][7] Although she did not receive authorship, Lalande sang her praises later, saying, \"Madame Lepaute computed for this book a table of numbers of oscillations for pendulums of different lengths, or the lengths for each given number of vibrations, from that of 18 lignes, that does 18000 vibrations per hour, up to that of 3000 leagues\".[3][1][4][2] Lalande was a leader at heart and helped lead Nicole-Reine Lepaute and her husband through the hard work calculating and creating different astronomical designs for predicting Halley's comet and creating new inventions of the clock. For instance, her husband had made a horizontal clock for the palace of Luxembourg and was granted permission to live there for the remainder of their life before he left for Russia. Lalande also sent in another clock that was made by Lepaute and went as the representative of the Academy of Science to observe this clock. ^ Lalande was a French astronomer who was known for his support of women in science, particularly his collaboration with Nicole-Reine Lepaute. He believed that women were capable of pursuing ambitious scientific work and that their intellectual pursuits were not a threat to the social order. However, despite his support for women in science, Lalande's views were still limited by the social and cultural norms of his time. He believed that women were best suited to assisting male researchers rather than leading their own research projects. He also emphasized the importance of women's roles as wives and mothers, and saw their scientific work as being compatible with their familial duties. In some ways, Lalande's views can be seen as both progressive and limiting. On the one hand, he recognized the intellectual capabilities of women and encouraged them to pursue scientific work. On the other hand, his views still placed women in a secondary role to men and reinforced traditional gender roles. Despite these limitations, Lalande's support for women in science was significant and helped to pave the way for future generations of women scientists. ^/nIn June 1757, she worked together with J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalande and Alexis Clairaut to calculate the date of the next passage of Halley's comet, last seen in 1682.[5][4][1][2] Halley couldn't precisely compute the return date beyond \"around the end of the year 1758 or the beginning of the next\", due to the gravitational pull of Jupiter and Saturn on the comet, which made for a three-body problem that couldn't be solved back then, for which Clairaut had found a solution recently.[5][2]/nIn order to solve it, Clairaut, Lalande and Lepaute divided calculations between them and worked in parallel, with Lepaute and Lalande focusing on the attraction of Jupiter and Saturn, while Clairaut calculated the orbit of the comet itself.[5] The team worked for more than six months straight, barely stopping for food, in order to produce a date before the comet arrived.[3][2] In November 1758, they gave a two-months window for when the comet would reach its perihelion, between 15 March and 15 May, [5] centered around 13 April 1759.[1] The comet ended up arriving on 13 March 1759.[3][1][5]/nAlthough this was a tenfold improvement over Halley's initial 2 years period,[5] there was still an error of a few days, which caused the astronomer Jean d'Alembert to ridicule their work and call it \"more laborious than deep\".[6][5]/nLepaute's involvement largely went unrecognised, and, while Lalande acknowledged her work in his Th\u00e9orie des Com\u00e8tes (Comet Theory), insisting that they could never have done the calculations without her,[3][7][2] Clairault removed mentions of her from the book he published in 1760, Th\u00e9orie du mouvement des com\u00e8tes, allegedly to please another woman.[2][3][4]/nIn 1759, Lalande became the Director of the Connaissance des Temps (Knowledge of the times), an astronomical almanach published by the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, and he appointed Lepaute as his assistant.[4][6] She did calculations from the computing plans Lalande prepared until 1774 and made various contributions to the almanac,[5][1] including calculations on a 1762 comet, as well as a table of parallactic angles.[2][3][4]/nAfterwards, she worked on \u00c9ph\u00e9merides, annual guides for astronomers and navigators. She calculated the position of Saturn for each day of the year from 1775 to 1784 for the seventh volume,[8] published in 1774, and she calculated on her own the daily positions of the Sun, the Moon and the planets for the eighth volume (1785-1792, published 1784).[2][3][9][4]/nShe also computed in 1762 the exact time of an annular solar eclipse that occurred on 1 April 1764 and published two maps under own name that showed the eclipse's extent: one over Europe, which showed the eclipse's transit in 15-minutes intervals, and one that detailed its successive phases over Paris.[2][3][4][5]/nThe solar eclipse that occurred on 1 April 1764 was a significant event that garnered a great deal of public interest across Europe. At the time, solar eclipses were still not fully understood and were viewed as mysterious and sometimes ominous events. The eclipse of 1764 was particularly noteworthy because it was visible across a large portion of Europe, including in Paris where it was near total. Many people gathered to observe the eclipse, and it was widely reported in newspapers and other publications of the time.In addition to the public interest in the eclipse, it also had scientific significance. Astronomers saw it as an opportunity to test the accuracy of their calculations of the   motion of the Moon, which is an important factor in predicting solar and lunar eclipses. Nicole-Reine Lepaute and her husband, Jean-Andr\u00e9 Lepaute, were among the astronomers who worked to calculate the precise timing of the eclipse and to observe its effects.^/nHer work went largely unappreciated and unrewarded despite its importance.[6] While Lalande would eventually become a professor of astronomy and the director of the Paris Observatory, she kept working for him for fifteen years as a human computer.[5] She nonetheless became a member of the distinguished Scientific Academy of B\u00e9ziers in 1761,[7] for which she calculated the ephemeris of the transit of Venus this year.[3][2] Lalande always recognised her work, and, after her death, he wrote a brief biography about her contributions to astronomy in his Astronomical Bibliography.[3]/nDoing so many calculations over the course of thirty years affected her sight to the point she had to stop working in 1783.[2][3][4][1]/nWhile childless herself, she adopted her husband's nephew, Joseph Lepaute Dagelet in 1768 and trained him in astronomy and advanced mathematics, which Lalande includes in her contributions to astronomy.[3]  He travelled south to the Terra Australis in 1773, became a professor of mathematics at Paris' Military School and became inducted in the French Royal Academy of Sciences in 1785. He most likely died in a shipwreck during a scientific expedition led by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Lap\u00e9rouse in 1788.[4][10]/nNicole Lepaute spent the last seven years[3][4] of her life taking care of her terminally ill husband until she died in Paris, in the parish of Saint-Roch, on 6 December 1788.[11]/nPhilibert Commerson attempted to name the Hydrangea flower Lepautia[1] or Peautia[12] after Lepaute. However, the flower's accepted name later became Hortensia.

In 1935 he moved to the TH Berlin  and in 1937, he followed the call to the TH Karlsruhe.  During the Second World War he worked on projectile design. Although the TH Berlin did invite him to work there in 1944, Wolfgang Haack was unable to take up the post because of the war. In 1949 he became the successor to Georg Hamel as Professor of Mathematics and Mechanics at the TU Berlin Department of Mathematics and Mechanics.

In 1964 Haack was called to the new chair for numerical mathematics, a position he was to hold until being given emeritus status in 1968./nThe interaction of Wolfgang Haack is at the interface between mathematics and mechanics. His research areas ranged from the mechanics of differential geometry and partial differential equations to numerical mathematics. In particular, he dealt with both elliptical and with hyperbolic partial differential equations of the first order. Coming from differential geometry, Pfaff's differential forms were always of special concern to him. As an engineer, he was always focussed on applied research, such as gas dynamics in supersonic flows. During his time in Berlin, he supervised over a dozen dissertations./nDuring World War II, Haack was involved in Nazi military research. His work on an analytical formula for projectile nose cone shapes that exhibit the lowest air resistance depending on caliber or diameter and length or volume and length of the profile was published in 1941 by the Lilienthal society[2] but was kept secret during World War II./nHaack shapes or Sears\u2013Haack bodies are not ogives or constructed from any other geometric figures. The shapes are instead mathematically derived streamlined bodies of revolution for the purpose of minimizing drag. Minimal projectile-shape variations can change the air-resistance and hence the effective range of high powered gun projectiles considerably, especially when they change velocity from the supersonic to the transonic and eventually to subsonic air flow regimes or vice versa during flight. For this kind of applications the Haack shape offers significantly improved characteristics compared to the tangent ogive or even the secant ogive often used for very-low-drag bullets and artillery shells.[3] Only after the end of World War II have Haack shaped projectiles for artillery guns and sniper rifles been produced.[4] Besides that Haack shapes are also applied in modern fast flying aircraft. Fighter aircraft are probably good examples of nose shapes optimized for the transonic region, although their nose shapes are often distorted by other considerations of avionics and inlets. For example, an F-16 nose appears to be a very close match to a Haack shape.[citation needed]/nHaack recognized early on the potential of computers for scientific and industrial research. As early as 1950 he established a working group on electronic calculating machines. He contacted Konrad Zuse with the aim that an electronic calculator would be acquired for the Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin.

By the 1970s, Gardner was a popular science writer and amateur mathematician. Rice said later that she would rush to grab each issue from the mail before anyone else could get it, especially her son who subscribed to the magazine.[7]/nIn 1975, Rice read Gardner's July column, \"On Tessellating the Plane with Convex Polygon Tiles\",[2][8] that discussed what kinds of convex polygons can fit together perfectly without any overlaps or gaps to fill the plane. In his column, Gardner indicated that \"the task of finding all convex polygons that tile the plane \u2026. was not completed until 1967 when Richard Brandon Kershner \u2026 found three pentagonal tilers that had been missed by all predecessors who had worked on the problem\".[8] Gardner was repeating Kershner's claim that the list of convex pentagon tilers was complete.  But within a month, Gardner received an example, by one of his readers, Richard James III,[9] of a new convex pentagon tiler, and published this news in his December 1975 column.[10]/nInspired by this new discovery, Rice decided to try to find other new pentagon tilers. Despite having only a high-school education, but a keen interest in art, she began devoting her free time to discovering new pentagonal tilings, ways to tile a plane using pentagons. She worked on the problem in her free time and through the 1975 holiday season \"by drawing diagrams on the kitchen table when no one was around and hiding them when her husband and children came home, or when friends stopped by\".[7] She even developed her own system of notation to represent the constraints on and relationships between the sides and angles of the pentagons.[11][12]/nBy February 1976, she had discovered a new pentagon type and its variations in shape and drew up several tessellations by these pentagon tiles. She mailed her discoveries to Gardner using her own home-made notation. He, in turn, sent Rice's work to Doris Schattschneider, an expert in tiling patterns, who was skeptical at first, saying that Rice's peculiar notation system seemed odd, like \"hieroglyphics\". But with careful examination, she was able to validate Rice's results.[7]/nBy October 1976, Rice had discovered 58 pentagon tilings that needed two pentagons stuck together in order to tile \"transitively\" (most of them previously unknown), which she arranged into 12 classes.[13] By December 1976, she had discovered two additional new types of tessellating pentagons and over 75 distinct tessellations by pentagons that were in blocks that could be seen as \"double hexagons\". In December 1977, she made her fourth discovery of a new type of pentagon tiler and by then had enumerated 103 \"2-block transitive\" pentagon tilings.[12]  In the following decade, she discovered several more tiling patterns by pentagons and explored aperiodic tilings./nRice had a keen interest in art, and had completed half of a correspondence course in commercial art before she married.  Throughout her investigations, she explored how to use pentagonal tilings as grids on which to overlay tessellations of flowers, shells, butterflies and bees.[11][6][12]/nRice's discoveries were never published in Gardner's Scientific American columns, but were revealed in an addendum to his original column that was included in his 1988 collection of columns, where he declared her discoveries \"fantastic achievements\".[14]/n\"Much of Rice\u2019s investigations remain unpublished, in that only the product of her investigations are shown.

He sided with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz during the Leibniz\u2013Newton calculus controversy and was an early proponent of Leibnizian calculus, which he made numerous contributions to; along with his brother Johann, he was one of the founders of the calculus of variations. He also discovered the fundamental mathematical constant e. However, his most important contribution was in the field of probability, where he derived the first version of the law of large numbers in his work Ars Conjectandi.[3]/nJacob Bernoulli was born in Basel in the Old Swiss Confederacy. Following his father's wish, he studied theology and entered the ministry. But contrary to the desires of his parents,[4] he also studied mathematics and astronomy. He traveled throughout Europe from 1676 to 1682, learning about the latest discoveries in mathematics and the sciences under leading figures of the time. This included the work of Johannes Hudde, Robert Boyle, and Robert Hooke. During this time he also produced an incorrect theory of comets./nBernoulli returned to Switzerland, and began teaching mechanics at the University of Basel from 1683. His doctoral dissertation Solutionem tergemini problematis was submitted in 1684.[5] It appeared in print in 1687.[6]/nIn 1684, Bernoulli married Judith Stupanus; they had two children. During this decade, he also began a fertile research career. His travels allowed him to establish correspondence with many leading mathematicians and scientists of his era, which he maintained throughout his life. During this time, he studied the new discoveries in mathematics, including Christiaan Huygens's De ratiociniis in aleae ludo, Descartes' La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie and Frans van Schooten's supplements of it. He also studied Isaac Barrow and John Wallis, leading to his interest in infinitesimal geometry. Apart from these, it was between 1684 and 1689 that many of the results that were to make up Ars Conjectandi were discovered./nHe was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Basel in 1687, remaining in this position for the rest of his life. By that time, he had begun tutoring his brother Johann Bernoulli on mathematical topics. The two brothers began to study the calculus as presented by Leibniz in his 1684 paper on the differential calculus in \"Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis\" published in Acta Eruditorum. They also studied the publications of von Tschirnhaus. It must be understood that Leibniz's publications on the calculus were very obscure to mathematicians of that time and the Bernoullis were among the first to try to understand and apply Leibniz's theories./nJacob collaborated with his brother on various applications of calculus. However the atmosphere of collaboration between the two brothers turned into rivalry as Johann's own mathematical genius began to mature, with both of them attacking each other in print, and posing difficult mathematical challenges to test each other's skills.[7] By 1697, the relationship had completely broken down./nThe lunar crater Bernoulli is also named after him jointly with his brother Johann./nJacob Bernoulli's first important contributions were a pamphlet on the parallels of logic and algebra published in 1685, work on probability in 1685 and geometry in 1687. His geometry result gave a construction to divide any triangle into four equal parts with two perpendicular lines./nBy 1689, he had published important work on infinite series and published his law of large numbers in probability theory. Jacob Bernoulli published five treatises on infinite series between 1682 and 1704. The first two of these contained many results, such as the fundamental result that \n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\n1\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\sum {\\frac {1}{n}}}\n\n diverges, which Bernoulli believed were new but they had actually been proved by Pietro Mengoli 40 years earlier and was proved by Nicole Oresme in the 14th century already.[8] Bernoulli could not find a closed form for \n\n\n\n\u2211\n\n\n1\n\nn\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\sum {\\frac {1}{n^{2}}}}\n\n, but he did show that it converged to a finite limit less than 2. Euler was the first to find the limit of this series in 1737. Bernoulli also studied the exponential series which came out of examining compound interest./nIn May 1690, in a paper published in Acta Eruditorum, Jacob Bernoulli showed that the problem of determining the isochrone is equivalent to solving a first-order nonlinear differential equation. The isochrone, or curve of constant descent, is the curve along which a particle will descend under gravity from any point to the bottom in exactly the same time, no matter what the starting point. It had been studied by Huygens in 1687 and Leibniz in 1689. After finding the differential equation, Bernoulli then solved it by what we now call separation of variables. Jacob Bernoulli's paper of 1690 is important for the history of calculus, since the term integral appears for the first time with its integration meaning. In 1696, Bernoulli solved the equation, now called the Bernoulli differential equation,/nJacob Bernoulli also discovered a general method to determine evolutes of a curve as the envelope of its circles of curvature. He also investigated caustic curves and in particular he studied these associated curves of the parabola, the logarithmic spiral and epicycloids around 1692. The lemniscate of Bernoulli was first conceived by Jacob Bernoulli in 1694. In 1695, he investigated the drawbridge problem which seeks the curve required so that a weight sliding along the cable always keeps the drawbridge balanced./nBernoulli's most original work was Ars Conjectandi, published in Basel in 1713, eight years after his death. The work was incomplete at the time of his death but it is still a work of the greatest significance in the theory of probability. The book also covers other related subjects, including a review of combinatorics, in particular the work of van Schooten, Leibniz, and Prestet, as well as the use of Bernoulli numbers in a discussion of the exponential series. Inspired by Huygens' work, Bernoulli also gives many examples on how much one would expect to win playing various games of chance. The term Bernoulli trial resulted from this work./nIn the last part of the book, Bernoulli sketches many areas of mathematical probability, including probability as a measurable degree of certainty; necessity and chance; moral versus mathematical expectation; a priori an a posteriori probability; expectation of winning when players are divided according to dexterity; regard of all available arguments, their valuation, and their calculable evaluation; and the law of large numbers./nBernoulli was one of the most significant promoters of the formal methods of higher analysis. Astuteness and elegance are seldom found in his method of presentation and expression, but there is a maximum of integrity./nIn 1683, Bernoulli discovered the constant e by studying a question about compound interest which required him to find the value of the following expression (which is in fact e):[9][10]/nOne example is an account that starts with $1.00 and pays 100 percent interest per year. If the interest is credited once, at the end of the year, the value is $2.00; but if the interest is computed and added twice in the year, the $1 is multiplied by 1.5 twice, yielding $1.00\u00d71.5\u00b2\u00a0=\u00a0$2.25. Compounding quarterly yields $1.00\u00d71.254\u00a0=\u00a0$2.4414..., and compounding monthly yields $1.00\u00d7(1.0833...)12\u00a0=\u00a0$2.613035..../nBernoulli noticed that this sequence approaches a limit (the force of interest) for more and smaller compounding intervals. Compounding weekly yields $2.692597..., while compounding daily yields $2.714567..., just two cents more. Using n as the number of compounding intervals, with interest of 100% / n in each interval, the limit for large n is the number that Euler later named e; with continuous compounding, the account value will reach $2.7182818.... More generally, an account that starts at $1, and yields (1+R) dollars at compound interest, will yield eR dollars with continuous compounding./nBernoulli wanted a logarithmic spiral and the motto Eadem mutata resurgo ('Although changed, I rise again the same') engraved on his tombstone.

Shing-Tung Yau, in his renowned resolution of the Calabi conjecture, had settled the case of closed K\u00e4hler manifolds with nonpositive first Chern class. His work in applying the method of continuity showed that C0 control of the K\u00e4hler potentials would suffice to prove existence of K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics on closed K\u00e4hler manifolds with positive first Chern class, also known as \"Fano manifolds.\" Tian and Yau extended Yau's analysis of the Calabi conjecture to noncompact settings, where they obtained partial results.[TY90] They also extended their work to allow orbifold singularities.[TY91]/nTian introduced the \"\u03b1-invariant,\" which is essentially the optimal constant in the Moser-Trudinger inequality when applied to K\u00e4hler potentials with a supremal value of 0. He showed that if the \u03b1-invariant is sufficiently large (i.e. if a sufficiently strong Moser-Trudinger inequality holds), then C0 control in Yau's method of continuity could be achieved.[T87b] This was applied to demonstrate new examples of K\u00e4hler-Einstein surfaces. The case of K\u00e4hler surfaces was revisited by Tian in 1990, giving a complete resolution of the K\u00e4hler-Einstein problem in that context.[T90b] The main technique was to study the possible geometric degenerations of a sequence of K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics, as detectable by the Gromov\u2013Hausdorff convergence. Tian adapted many of the technical innovations of Karen Uhlenbeck, as developed for Yang-Mills connections, to the setting of K\u00e4hler metrics. Some similar and influential work in the Riemannian setting was done in 1989 and 1990 by Michael Anderson, Shigetoshi Bando, Atsushi Kasue, and Hiraku Nakajima.[6][7][8]/nTian's most renowned contribution to the K\u00e4hler-Einstein problem came in 1997. Yau had conjectured in the 1980s, based partly in analogy to the Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau theorem, that existence of a K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric should correspond to stability of the underlying K\u00e4hler manifold in a certain sense of geometric invariant theory. It was generally understood, especially following work of Akito Futaki,[9] that the existence of holomorphic vector fields should act as an obstruction to the existence of K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics. Tian and Wei Yue Ding established that this obstruction is not sufficient within the class of K\u00e4hler orbifolds.[DT92] Tian, in his 1997 article, gave concrete examples of K\u00e4hler manifolds (rather than orbifolds) which had no holomorphic vector fields and also no K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics, showing that the desired criterion lies deeper.[T97] Yau had proposed that, rather than holomorphic vector fields on the manifold itself, it should be relevant to study the deformations of projective embeddings of K\u00e4hler manifolds under holomorphic vector fields on projective space. This idea was modified by Tian, introducing the notion of K-stability and showing that any K\u00e4hler-Einstein manifold must be K-stable.[T97]/nSimon Donaldson, in 2002, modified and extended Tian's definition of K-stability.[10] The conjecture that K-stability would be sufficient to ensure the existence of a K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric became known as the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture. In 2015, Xiuxiong Chen, Donaldson, and Song Sun, published a proof of the conjecture, receiving the Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry for their work.[11][12][13] Tian published a proof of the conjecture in the same year, although Chen, Donaldson, and Sun have accused Tian of academic and mathematical misconduct over his paper.[T15][14][15]/nIn one of his first articles, Tian studied the space of Calabi-Yau metrics on a K\u00e4hler manifold.[T87a] He showed that any infinitesimal deformation of Calabi-Yau structure can be 'integrated' to a one-parameter family of Calabi-Yau metrics; this proves that the \"moduli space\" of Calabi-Yau metrics on the given manifold has the structure of a smooth manifold. This was also studied earlier by Andrey Todorov, and the result is known as the Tian\u2212Todorov theorem.[16] As an application, Tian found a formula for the Weil-Petersson metric on the moduli space of Calabi-Yau metrics in terms of the period mapping.[T87a][17]/nMotivated by the K\u00e4hler-Einstein problem and a conjecture of Yau relating to Bergman metrics, Tian studied the following problem. Let L be a line bundle over a K\u00e4hler manifold M, and fix a hermitian bundle metric whose curvature form is a K\u00e4hler form on M. Suppose that for sufficiently large m, an orthonormal set of holomorphic sections of the line bundle L\u2297m defines a projective embedding of M. One can pull back the Fubini-Study metric to define a sequence of metrics on M as m increases. Tian showed that a certain rescaling of this sequence will necessarily converge in the C2 topology to the original K\u00e4hler metric.[T90a] The refined asymptotics of this sequence were taken up in a number of influential subsequent papers by other authors, and are particularly important in Simon Donaldson's program on extremal metrics.[18][19][20][21][22] The approximability of a K\u00e4hler metric by K\u00e4hler metrics induced from projective embeddings is also relevant to Yau's picture of the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture, as indicated above./nIn a highly technical article, Xiuxiong Chen and Tian studied the regularity theory of certain complex Monge-Amp\u00e8re equations, with applications to the study of the geometry of extremal K\u00e4hler metrics.[CT08] Although their paper has been very widely cited, Julius Ross and David Witt Nystr\u00f6m found counterexamples to the regularity results of Chen and Tian in 2015.[23] It is not clear which results of Chen and Tian's article remain valid./nPseudoholomorphic curves were shown by Mikhail Gromov in 1985 to be powerful tools in symplectic geometry.[24] In 1991, Edward Witten conjectured a use of Gromov's theory to define enumerative invariants.[25] Tian and Yongbin Ruan found the details of such a construction, proving that the various intersections of the images of pseudo-holomorphic curves is independent of many choices, and in particular gives an associative multilinear mapping on the homology of certain symplectic manifolds.[RT95] This structure is known as quantum cohomology; a contemporaneous and similarly influential approach is due to Dusa McDuff and Dietmar Salamon.[26] Ruan and Tian's results are in a somewhat more general setting./nWith Jun Li, Tian gave a purely algebraic adaptation of these results to the setting of algebraic varieties.[LT98b] This was done at the same time as Kai Behrend and Barbara Fantechi, using a different approach.[27]/nLi and Tian then adapted their algebro-geometric work back to the analytic setting in symplectic manifolds, extending the earlier work of Ruan and Tian.[LT98a] Tian and Gang Liu made use of this work to prove the well-known Arnold conjecture on the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms.[LT98c] However, these papers of Li-Tian and Liu-Tian on symplectic Gromov-Witten theory have been criticized by Dusa McDuff and Katrin Wehrheim as being incomplete or incorrect, saying that Li and Tian's article [LT98a] \"lacks almost all detail\" on certain points and that Liu and Tian's article [LT98c] has \"serious analytic errors.\"[28]/nIn 1995, Tian and Weiyue Ding studied the harmonic map heat flow of a two-dimensional closed Riemannian manifold into a closed Riemannian manifold N.[DT95] In a seminal 1985 work, following the 1982 breakthrough of Jonathan Sacks and Karen Uhlenbeck, Michael Struwe had studied this problem and showed that there is a weak solution which exists for all positive time. Furthermore, Struwe showed that the solution u is smooth away from finitely many spacetime points; given any sequence of spacetime points at which the solution is smooth and which converge to a given singular point (p, T), one can perform some rescalings to (subsequentially) define a finite number of harmonic maps from the round 2-dimensional sphere into N, called \"bubbles.\" Ding and Tian proved a certain \"energy quantization,\" meaning that the defect between the Dirichlet energy of u(T) and the limit of the Dirichlet energy of u(t) as t approaches T is exactly measured by the sum of the Dirichlet energies of the bubbles. Such results are significant in geometric analysis, following the original energy quantization result of Yum-Tong Siu and Shing-Tung Yau in their proof of the Frankel conjecture.[29] The analogous problem for harmonic maps, as opposed to Ding and Tian's consideration of the harmonic map flow, was considered by Changyou Wang around the same time.[30]/nA major paper of Tian's dealt with the Yang\u2013Mills equations.[T00a] In addition to extending much of Karen Uhlenbeck's analysis to higher dimensions, he studied the interaction of Yang-Mills theory with calibrated geometry. Uhlenbeck had shown in the 1980s that, when given a sequence of Yang-Mills connections of uniformly bounded energy, they will converge smoothly on the complement of a subset of codimension at least four, known as the complement of the \"singular set\". Tian showed that the singular set is a rectifiable set. In the case that the manifold is equipped with a calibration, one can restrict interest to the Yang-Mills connections which are self-dual relative to the calibration. In this case, Tian showed that the singular set is calibrated. For instance, the singular set of a sequence of hermitian Yang-Mills connections of uniformly bounded energy will be a holomorphic cycle. This is a significant geometric feature of the analysis of Yang-Mills connections./nIn 2006, Tian and Zhou Zhang studied the Ricci flow in the special setting of closed K\u00e4hler manifolds.[TZ06] Their principal achievement was to show that the maximal time of existence can be characterized in purely cohomological terms. This represents one sense in which the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow is significantly simpler than the usual Ricci flow, where there is no (known) computation of the maximal time of existence from a given geometric context. Tian and Zhang's proof consists of a use of the scalar maximum principle as applied to various geometric evolution equations, in terms of a K\u00e4hler potential as parametrized by a linear deformation of forms which is cohomologous to the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow itself. In a notable work with Jian Song, Tian analyzed the K\u00e4hler Ricci flow on certain two-dimensional complex manifolds.[ST07]/nIn 2002 and 2003, Grigori Perelman posted three papers on the arXiv which purported to prove the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture and Geometrization conjecture in the field of three-dimensional geometric topology.[31][32][33] Perelman's papers were immediately acclaimed for many of their novel ideas and results, although the technical details of many of his arguments were seen as hard to verify. In collaboration with John Morgan, Tian published an exposition of Perelman's papers in 2007, filling in many of the details.[MT07] Other expositions, which have also been widely studied, were written by Huai-Dong Cao and Xi-Ping Zhu, and by Bruce Kleiner and John Lott.[34][35] Morgan and Tian's exposition is the only of the three to deal with Perelman's third paper,[33] which is irrelevant for analysis of the geometrization conjecture but uses curve-shortening flow to provide a simpler argument for the special case of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture. Eight years after the publication of Morgan and Tian's book, Abbas Bahri pointed to part of their exposition of this paper to be in error, having relied upon incorrect computations of evolution equations.[36] The error, which dealt with details not present in Perelman's paper, was soon after amended by Morgan and Tian.[37]/nIn collaboration with Nata\u0161a \u0160e\u0161um, Tian also published an exposition of Perelman's work on the Ricci flow of K\u00e4hler manifolds, which Perelman did not publish in any form.[38]/nResearch articles./nBooks.", "29424933": "Timothy Browning is a mathematician working in number theory, examining the interface of analytic number theory and Diophantine geometry.[2]\nBrowning is currently a Professor of number theory at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) in Klosterneuburg, Austria.[3]/nIn 2008, Browning was awarded the Whitehead Prize by the London Mathematical Society for his significant contributions on the interface of analytic number theory and arithmetic geometry concerning the number and distribution of rational and integral solutions to Diophantine equations.[4]/nIn 2009, Browning won the Ferran Sunyer i Balaguer Prize.[5] The prize is awarded for a mathematical monograph of an expository nature presenting the latest developments in an active area of research in Mathematics, in which the applicant has made important contributions.[6] Browning won the prize for his monograph entitled Quantitative Arithmetic of Projective Varieties.[6][7]/nIn 2010, Browning was awarded the Leverhulme Mathematics Prize for his work on number theory and diophantine geometry.[8]", "45055276": "Prasad V.

The lunar crater Bettinus was named after him by Giovanni Riccioli in 1651.[1]/nMario Bettinus studied mathematics under the Belgian Jean Verviers and Giuseppe Biancani at the Jesuit school in Parma. He was responsible for teaching military architecture in Parma during the period 1624\u20131630. Among the students attending his classes at the seminarium nobilium were the two sons of Duke Ranuccio, Ottavio and Odoardo. Besides being Ottavio's teacher of military mathematics, Bettinus also served as military consultant to the courts of Parma (1612\u20131613), Modena (1617\u20131618) and again Parma (1626\u20131627), and as a military architect at Novellara (1618\u20131619), seat of the novitiate of the Jesuit \u2018Provincia Veneta\u2019.[2]/nBesides being the mentor of Guarino Guarini (1624\u20131683), Bettinus was also a close friend of Prince Raimondo Montecuccoli (1609\u20131680)\u2014the latter had even sent him a copy of his work on fortifications from Hohenneg on 15 July 1652./nBettinus privileged mathematics, intended as the only discipline abstract enough to allow intellect to approach theology. The Jesuit mathematician held the belief that, precisely because of their abstraction, mathematical theorems and demonstrations lead one away from the mundane and toward the divine. On the contrary, he considered a research based on sense as  too bound to human limitations (and, therefore, unreliable). Yet, Bettinus was a skilled astronomer; and clues of experimental knowledge are all but invisible in his work.[3]/nHis best-known work is Apiaria Universae Philosophiae Mathematicae 'Beehives of all mathematical philosophy' (1645), an encyclopedic collection of mathematical curiosities.[4] This book, reflecting his many interests, is a collection of scientific mysteries embracing everything from geometrical demonstrations to illusionistic stage sets, music, perpetual motion machines, and anamorphoses. According to Bettinus, the natural world abounds in mathematical delights such as spider webs and the honeycombs of bees. From these creations of nature can be drawn geometrical principles useful for mechanical, optical, and artistic designs.[5] This work had been reviewed by Christoph Grienberger.[6]/nIn his Apiaria military technologies featured prominently. His machines of war were mentioned by Montecuccoli, by the famous Jesuit mathematicians Athanasius Kircher and Jacques Ozanam and by the Polish master of artillery, Casimir Semenowycz. This book must have been rated highly by the English physician and philosopher Sir Thomas Browne, for a copy can be found in his library./nBettinus' work included a commentary on the first six books of Euclid, a traditional part of Jesuit mathematical curriculum and a form followed by Clavius a half century earlier.[7] Bettinus penned a method for laying out a sundial which was posthumously published in the book Recreationum Mathematicarum Apiaria Novissima 1660.", "48430466": "Charles Herbert Clemens Jr. (born 15 August 1939)[1] is an American mathematician specializing in complex algebraic geometry.[2]/nClemens received his bachelor's degree from College of the Holy Cross in 1961 and in 1966 his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, under Phillip Griffiths with thesis Picard\u2013Lefschetz Theorem for Families of Algebraic Varieties Acquiring Certain Singularities.[3] In 1970 he became an assistant professor at Columbia University and went on to become an associate professor before leaving in 1975 to become an associate professor at the University of Utah where he became a full professor in 1976 and a Distinguished Professor in 2001.

After working in algebraic geometry for two decades, Salmon devoted the last forty years of his life to theology. His entire career was spent at Trinity College Dublin./nSalmon was born in Dublin, to Michael Salmon and Helen Weekes (the daughter of the Reverend Edward Weekes), but he spent his boyhood in Cork City, where his father Michael was a linen merchant. He attended Hamblin and Porter's School there before starting at Trinity College in 1833./nIn 1837 he won a scholarship and graduated from Trinity in 1839 with first-class honours in mathematics. In 1841 at the age of 21, he attained a paid fellowship and teaching position in mathematics at Trinity. In 1845 he was additionally appointed to a position in theology at the university, after having been ordained a deacon in 1844 and a priest in the Church of Ireland in 1845./nHe remained at Trinity for the rest of his career./nHe died at the Provost's House on 22 January 1904 and was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery, Dublin.[1] He was an avid reader throughout his life, and his obituary refers to him as \"specially devoted to the novels of Jane Austen.\"[2]/nIn 1844 he married Frances Anne Salvador, daughter of Rev J L Salvador of Staunton-upon-Wye in Herefordshire, with whom he had six children, of which only two survived him./nIn the late 1840s and the 1850s Salmon was in regular and frequent communication with Arthur Cayley and J. J. Sylvester. The three of them, together with a small number of other mathematicians (including Charles Hermite), were developing a system for dealing with n-dimensional algebra and geometry. During this period Salmon published about 36 papers in journals. In these papers for the most part he solved narrowly defined, concrete problems in algebraic geometry, as opposed to more broadly systematic or foundational questions. But he was an early adopter of the foundational innovations of Cayley and the others. In 1859 he published the book Lessons Introductory to the Modern Higher Algebra (where the word \"higher\" means n-dimensional). This was for a while simultaneously the state-of-the-art and the standard presentation of the subject, and went through updated and expanded editions in 1866, 1876 and 1885, and was translated into German and French./nFrom 1858 to 1867 he was the Donegall Lecturer in Mathematics at Trinity./nMeanwhile, back in 1848 Salmon had published an undergraduate textbook entitled A Treatise on Conic Sections. This text remained in print for over fifty years, going through five updated editions in English, and was translated into German, French and Italian. Salmon himself did not participate in the expansions and updates of the more later editions. The German version, which was a \"free adaptation\" by Wilhelm Fiedler, was popular as an undergraduate text in Germany. Salmon also published two other mathematics texts, A Treatise on Higher Plane Curves (1852) and A Treatise on the Analytic Geometry of Three Dimensions (1862). These too were in print for a long time and went through a number of later editions, with Salmon delegating the work of the later editions to others./nIn 1858 he was presented with the Cunningham Medal of the Royal Irish Academy. In June 1863 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society followed in 1868 by the award of their Royal Medal \"For his researches in analytical geometry and the theory of surfaces\". In 1889 Salmon received the Copley Medal of the society, the highest honorary award in British science, but by then he had long since lost his interest in mathematics and science./nSalmon received honorary degrees from several universities, including that of Doctor mathematicae (honoris causa) from the Royal Frederick University on 6 September 1902, when they celebrated the centennial of the birth of mathematician Niels Henrik Abel.[3][4]/nSalmon's theorem\u00a0[ru] is named in honor of George Salmon./nFrom the early 1860s onward Salmon was primarily occupied with theology. In 1866 he was appointed Regius Professor of Divinity at TCD, at which point he resigned from his position in the mathematics department at TCD. In 1871 he accepted an additional post of chancellor of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin./nOne of his early publications in theology was in 1853 as a contributor to a book of rebuttals to the Tracts for the Times. Arguments against Roman Catholicism were a recurring theme in Salmon's theology and culminated in his widely read 1888 book Infallibility of the Church in which he argued that certain beliefs of the Roman church were absurd, especially the beliefs in the infallibility of the church and the infallibility of the pope. Salmon also wrote books about eternal punishment, miracles, and interpretation of the New Testament. His book An Historical Introduction to the Study of the Books of the New Testament, which was widely read, is an account of the reception and interpretation of the gospels in the early centuries of Christianity as seen through the writings of leaders such as Irenaeus and Eusebius./nSalmon was a keen chess player. He was a patron to the University Chess Club,[5] and was also the President of Dublin Chess Club from 1890\u20131903.[6] He participated in the second British Chess Congress and had the honour of playing the chess prodigy Paul Morphy in Birmingham, England, on 27 August 1858.[7][8]  He beat Daniel Harrwitz in an interesting game.[9]/nEven in his book Infallibility of the Church, Salmon mentions chess a few times:/nSalmon was Provost of Trinity from 1888 until his death in 1904. The highlight of his career may have been when in 1892 he presided over the great celebrations marking the tercentenary of the College, which had been founded by Queen Elizabeth I./nIn 1870, Trinity had introduced the Examinations for Women, following a request from Alexandra College.[11] In 1880, while Humphrey Lloyd was provost, Samuel Haughton, Anthony Traill, John Jellett and others proposed that degrees be open to women, on the same terms as men. Lloyd, as provost, was not a supporter, and the motion was defeated. In 1881, Jellett became provost, and committee was set up in 1882 to investigate the matter, including future provosts Salmon and Trail, respectively opposing and supporting admission. Despite the support of the provost, the committee was not effective./nSalmon was provost during the campaign for admission by the Central Association of Irish Schoolmistresses (CAISM), in which Alice Oldham was an important figure. Salmon and the board were not generally receptive to the campaign. While Salmon was a conservative, his strong opposition to the admission of women cannot be dismissed simply; he had been a member of the council of Alexandra College, had supported girls competing on equal terms with boys in Intermediate examinations and his daughter, from the provost's house, had acted as coordinator for the Examinations for Women and was a member of CAISM.[11][12] In 1896, all eight members of the board were over 70 years of age, but by 1901 retirements and deaths had resulted in the majority of the board being pro-admission.[13]/nIn 1902, John Mahaffy proposed that the time had come to take action on the issue of awarding degrees to women. This was passed by the board, and, though the motion was opposed by Salmon, a committee was set up to report, and by the end of the year the board resolved that the Lord Lieutenant, William Ward should be petitioned to move the king to issue new Letters Patent for admission of Women.[11] In 1903, Ward replied, indicating that the agreement of the provost was essential before Letters Patent would be issued. Salmon wrote withdrawing his formal objections in July 1903. The Letters Patent were received by the board on 16 January 1904. This was Salmon's last board meeting.[11]/nOn 22 January 1904, Isabel Marion Weir Johnston became the first woman undergraduate to succeed in registering at Trinity, and by the end of year dozens of other women had done likewise.[14] She recalled, \"When I arrived in Dublin 1904, I was informed that he [Salmon] had died that day, and the examination had to be put off until after the funeral.\"[15]/nSalmon continued to attend board meetings up to his death.[16] At his death, Salmon had been a familiar figure in Trinity for over 62 years, and was held in affection even by those who disagreed with him.[13][16] Both Trail and Mahaffy were eager to succeed Salmon as provost, and were lobbying to secure the position on the day of his death.  Just before his death, Salmon is said to have anticipated this in another apocryphal story. He dreamed that he was dead, and his funeral was processing across front square, followed by weeping Fellows and Scholars. His coffin was laid in the chapel, \"and then\", he said, \"I sat up in my coffin, whereupon Mahaffy and Trail wept louder than ever\".[13]", "18578839": "Mark Jay Ablowitz (born June 5, 1945, New York)[2] is a professor in the department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Colorado.

L\u00e9vy  attended the \u00c9cole Polytechnique and published his first paper in 1905, at the age of nineteen, while still an undergraduate, in which he introduced the L\u00e9vy\u2013Steinitz theorem.  His teacher and advisor was Jacques Hadamard.  After graduation, he spent a year in military service and then studied for three years at the \u00c9cole des Mines, where he became a professor in 1913.[2]/nDuring World War I L\u00e9vy conducted mathematical analysis work for the French Artillery. In 1920 he was appointed Professor of Analysis at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, where his students included Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot and Georges Matheron. He remained at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique until his retirement in 1959, with a gap during World War II after his 1940 firing because of the Vichy anti-Jewish legislation.[2]/nL\u00e9vy made many fundamental contributions to probability theory and the nascent theory of stochastic processes. \nHe introduced the notion of 'stable distribution' which share the property of stability under addition of independent variables and proved a general version of the Central Limit theorem, recorded in his 1937 book Th\u00e9orie de l'addition des variables al\u00e9atoires, using the notion of characteristic function.

She traveled to Russia, and wrote a monograph on chi-squared tests with Mikhail Nikulin.[3]/nIn 1990 she and Igor Evstigneev wrote a second monograph, on random fields. Her research in this period also concerned metric entropy and asymptotic efficiency. She began her work in biostatistics, involving studies of different mammalian populations, and led a major study on statistical estimation near critical points of a parameter.[3]/nBeginning in 2000, at Arizona State, she studied pink noise and stochastic resonance, which she applied to epidemic models in biostatistics as well as to the firing patterns of neurons.[3]/nGreenwood was elected as a fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics in 1985.

He contributed to the theory of general relativity,[8][9][10][11] and was the first to analyze the inertial and gravitational interaction of negative mass[12] and the first to explicate correctly the nature of gravitational waves.[9]  In his 1990 autobiography, Bondi regarded the 1962 work on gravitational waves[9] as his \"best scientific work\".[13]:\u200a79/nBondi was born in Vienna, the son of a Jewish medical doctor. He was brought up in Vienna, where he studied at the Realgymnasium. He showed early prodigious ability at mathematics, and was recommended to Arthur Eddington by Abraham Fraenkel. Fraenkel was a distant relation, the only mathematician in the extended family and Hermann's mother had the foresight to arrange a meeting between her young son and the famous man knowing that this might be the key to enabling him to follow his wishes and become a mathematician himself. Eddington encouraged him to travel to England to read the mathematical tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge. He arrived in Cambridge in 1937, escaping from antisemitism in Austria. Realizing the perilous position of his parents in 1938, shortly before the Anschluss, he sent them a telegram telling them to leave Austria at once. They managed to reach Switzerland and subsequently settled in New York.[citation needed]/nIn the early years of World War II, he was interned on the Isle of Man and in Canada as a friendly enemy alien. Other internees included Thomas Gold and Max Perutz. In 1940, Bondi became Senior Wrangler at the University of Cambridge. Bondi and Gold were released from internment by the end of 1941, and worked with Fred Hoyle on radar at the Admiralty Signals Establishment. He became a British subject in 1946.[citation needed]/nBondi lectured in mathematics in the University of Cambridge from 1945 to 1954. He was a fellow of Trinity College from 1943 to 1949 and from 1952 to 1954.[citation needed]/nIn 1948, Bondi, Hoyle and Gold formulated the Steady State theory, which holds that the universe is constantly expanding but matter is constantly created to form new stars and galaxies to maintain a constant average density. Steady State theory was eclipsed by the rival Big Bang theory with the discovery of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).[citation needed]/nBondi was one of the first to correctly appreciate the nature of gravitational radiation, introducing Bondi radiation coordinates, the Bondi k-calculus, the notions of Bondi mass and Bondi news, and writing review articles. He popularized the sticky bead argument which was said to be originally due, anonymously, to Richard Feynman, for the claim that physically meaningful gravitational radiation is indeed predicted by general relativity, an assertion which was controversial up until about 1955. A 1947 paper revived interest in the Lema\u00eetre\u2013Tolman metric,[8] an inhomogeneous, spherically symmetric dust solution (often called the LTB or Lema\u00eetre\u2013Tolman\u2013Bondi metric). Bondi also contributed to the theory of accretion of matter from a cloud of gas onto a star or a black hole, working with Raymond Lyttleton and giving his name to \"Bondi accretion\" and the \"Bondi radius\".[citation needed]/nHe became a professor in King's College London in 1954 and was appointed Emeritus Professor \nthere in 1985.[14] He was secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society from 1956 to 1964./nBondi was also active outside the confines of academic lecturing and research.

He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1946 New Year Honours,[2] Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1955 New Year Honours[3] and Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1970 New Year Honours.[4]/nMI5's Peter Wright, in his 1987 best-selling book Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer, wrote about Alexander's assistance to MI5 in the ongoing Venona project, as well as other important mutual cooperation between the two organizations, which broke down previous barriers to progress. \"Any help is gratefully received in this department\", Alexander told Wright, and that proved the case from then on. Wright also lauded Alexander's professionalism, and opined that the exceptional mental demands of his cryptanalytical career and chess hobby likely contributed to Alexander's early death at age 64, despite his healthy lifestyle./nAlexander represented Cambridge University in the Varsity chess matches of 1929, 1930, 1931 and 1932 (he studied at King's College, Cambridge). He was twice a winner of the British Chess Championship, in 1938 and 1956. Alexander represented England in the Chess Olympiad six times, in 1933, 1935, 1937, 1939, 1954 and 1958. At the 1939 Olympiad in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Alexander had to leave part-way through the event, along with the rest of the English team, because of the declaration of World War II, since he was required at home for codebreaking duties. He was also the non-playing captain of England from 1964 to 1970. Alexander was awarded the International Master title in 1950 and the International Master for Correspondence Chess title in 1970. He won Hastings 1946/47 with the score 7\u00bd/9, a point ahead of Savielly Tartakower.[5][6] Alexander's best tournament result may have been first equal (with David Bronstein) at Hastings 1953/54, where he went undefeated and beat Soviet grandmasters David Bronstein and Alexander Tolush in individual games. Alexander's opportunities to appear abroad were limited as he was not allowed to play chess in the Soviet bloc because of his secret work in cryptography.[7] He was also the chess columnist of The Sunday Times in the 1960s and 1970s./nMany knowledgeable chess people believe that Alexander had Grandmaster potential, had he been able to develop his chess abilities further.[8] Many top players peak in their late twenties and early thirties, but for Alexander this stretch coincided with World War II, when high-level competitive opportunities were unavailable. After this, his professional responsibilities as a senior cryptanalyst limited his top-class appearances. He defeated Mikhail Botvinnik in one game of a team radio match against the Soviet Union in 1946, at a time when Botvinnik was probably the world's top player.

He is best remembered for the Mahalanobis distance, a statistical measure, and for being one of the members of the first Planning Commission of free India. He made pioneering studies in anthropometry in India. He founded the Indian Statistical Institute, and contributed to the design of large-scale sample surveys.[2][7][4][8] For his contributions, Mahalanobis has been considered the Father of statistics in India.[9]/nMahalanobis was born on 29 June, 1893, in Calcutta, Bengal Presidency (now West Bengal).\nMahalanobis belonged to a prominent Bengali Brahmin family of landed gentry in Bikrampur, Dhaka, Bengal Presidency (now in Bangladesh).[10][11] His grandfather Gurucharan (1833\u20131916) moved to Calcutta in 1854 and built up a business, starting a chemist shop in 1860. Gurucharan was influenced by Debendranath Tagore (1817\u20131905), father of the Nobel Prize-winning poet, Rabindranath Tagore. Gurucharan was actively involved in social movements such as the Brahmo Samaj, acting as its treasurer and president. His house on 210 Cornwallis Street was the centre of the Brahmo Samaj. Gurucharan married a widow, an action against social traditions at that time.[citation needed][1]/nGurucharan's younger son, Prabodh Chandra (1869\u20131942), was the father of P.\u00a0 C.\u00a0 Mahalanobis. Born in the house at 210 Cornwallis Street, Mahalanobis grew up in a socially active family surrounded by intellectuals and reformers.[2]/nMahalanobis received his early schooling at the Brahmo Boys School in Calcutta, graduating in 1908. He joined the Presidency College, then affiliated with the University of Calcutta, where he was taught by teachers who included Jagadish Chandra Bose, and Prafulla Chandra Ray. Others attending were Meghnad Saha, a year junior, and Subhas Chandra Bose, two years his junior at college.[12] Mahalanobis received a Bachelor of Science degree with honours in physics in 1912. He left for England in 1913 to join the University of London.[citation needed]/nAfter missing a train, he stayed with a friend at King's College, Cambridge. He was impressed by King's College Chapel and his host's friend M. A. Candeth suggested that he could try joining there, which he did. He did well in his studies at King's, but also took an interest in cross-country walking and punting on the river. He interacted with the mathematical genius Srinivasa Ramanujan during the latter's time at Cambridge.[13] After his Tripos in physics, Mahalanobis worked with C. T. R. Wilson at the Cavendish Laboratory. He took a short break and went to India, where he was introduced to the Principal of Presidency College and was invited to take classes in physics.[2]/nAfter returning to England, Mahalanobis was introduced to the journal Biometrika. This interested him so much that he bought a complete set and took them to India. He discovered the utility of statistics to problems in meteorology and anthropology, beginning to work on problems on his journey back to India.[2]/nIn Calcutta, Mahalanobis met Nirmalkumari (Rani), daughter of Heramba Chandra Maitra, a leading educationist and member of the Brahmo Samaj. They married on 27 February 1923, although her father did not completely approve of the union. He was concerned about Mahalanobis's opposition to various clauses in the membership of the student wing of the Brahmo Samaj, including prohibitions against members' drinking alcohol and smoking. Sir Nilratan Sircar, P. C. Mahalanobis' maternal uncle, took part in the wedding ceremony in place of the father of the bride.[2]/nMany colleagues of Mahalanobis took an interest in statistics. An informal group developed in the Statistical Laboratory, which was located in his room at the Presidency College, Calcutta. On 17 December 1931 Mahalanobis called a meeting with Pramatha Nath Banerji (Minto Professor of Economics), Nikhil Ranjan Sen (Khaira Professor of Applied Mathematics) and Sir R.\u00a0N.\u00a0Mukherji. Together they established the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) in Baranagar, and formally registered on 28 April 1932 as a non-profit distributing learned society under the Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860.[2]/nThe institute was initially in the Physics Department of the Presidency College; its expenditure in the first year was Rs.\u00a0238. It gradually grew with the pioneering work of a group of his colleagues, including S.\u00a0S.\u00a0Bose, J.\u00a0M.\u00a0Sengupta, R.\u00a0C.\u00a0Bose, S.\u00a0N.\u00a0Roy, K.\u00a0R.\u00a0Nair, R.\u00a0R.\u00a0Bahadur, Gopinath Kallianpur, D.\u00a0B.\u00a0Lahiri and C.\u00a0R.\u00a0Rao. The institute also gained major assistance through Pitambar Pant, who was a secretary to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Pant was trained in statistics at the Institute and took a keen interest in its affairs.[2]/nIn 1933, the Institute founded the journal Sankhya, along the lines of Karl Pearson's Biometrika.[2]/nThe institute started a training section in 1938. Many of the early workers left the ISI for careers in the United States and with the government of India. Mahalanobis invited J.\u00a0B.\u00a0S.\u00a0Haldane to join him at the ISI; Haldane joined as a Research Professor from August 1957, staying until February 1961. He resigned from the ISI due to frustrations with the administration and disagreements with Mahalanobis' policies. He was concerned with the frequent travels and absence of the director and complained that the \"... journeyings of our Director define a novel random vector.\" Haldane helped the ISI develop in biometrics.[14]/nIn 1959, the institute was declared as an institute of national importance and a Deemed university.[2]/nThe methods pioneered at the institute are now used by the World Bank and the United Nations. As Nobel Prize-winning economist Angus Deaton and co-author Valerie Kozel wrote in 2005: \"Where Mahalanobis and India led, the rest of the world has followed, so that today, most countries have a recent household income or expenditure survey. Most countries, can only envy India in its statistical capacity\"./nEconomists TN Srinivasan, Rohini Somanathan, Pranab Bardhan and another Nobel-winner Abhijit Banerjee have since argued that there is \"no other instance of an entirely homegrown institution in a developing country becoming a world leader in a large field of general interest\".[15]/nMahalanobis distance is one of the most widely used metrics to find how much a point diverges from a distribution, based on measurements in multiple dimensions. It is widely used in the field of cluster analysis and classification. It was first proposed by Mahalanobis in 1930 in context of his study on racial likeness.[16] From a chance meeting with Nelson Annandale, then the director of the Zoological Survey of India, at the 1920 Nagpur session of the Indian Science Congress led to Annandale asking him to analyse anthropometric measurements of Anglo-Indians in Calcutta. Mahalanobis had been influenced by the anthropometric studies published in the journal Biometrika and he chose to ask the questions on what factors influence the formation of European and Indian marriages. He wanted to examine if the Indian side came from any specific castes. He used the data collected by Annandale and the caste-specific measurements made by Herbert Risley to come up with the conclusion that the sample represented a mix of Europeans mainly with people from Bengal and Punjab but not with those from the Northwest Frontier Provinces or from Chhota Nagpur. He also concluded that the intermixture more frequently involved the higher castes than the lower ones.[17][18] This analysis was described by his first scientific article in 1922.[19] During the course of these studies he found a way of comparing and grouping populations using a multivariate distance measure. This measure, denoted \"D2\" and now eponymously named Mahalanobis distance, is independent of measurement scale.[2] Mahalanobis also took an interest in physical anthropology and in the accurate measurement of skull measurements for which he developed an instrument that he called the \"profiloscope\".[20]/nHis most important contributions are related to large-scale sample surveys. He introduced the concept of pilot surveys and advocated the usefulness of sampling methods. Early surveys began between 1937 and 1944 and included topics such as consumer expenditure, tea-drinking habits, public opinion, crop acreage and plant disease. Harold Hotelling wrote: \"No technique of random sample has, so far as I can find, been developed in the United States or elsewhere, which can compare in accuracy with that described by Professor Mahalanobis\" and Sir R.\u00a0A.\u00a0Fisher commented that \"The ISI has taken the lead in the original development of the technique of sample surveys, the most potent fact-finding process available to the administration\".[2]/nHe introduced a method for estimating crop yields which involved statisticians sampling in the fields by cutting crops in a circle of diameter 4 feet. Others such as P.\u00a0V.\u00a0Sukhatme and V.\u00a0G.\u00a0Panse who began to work on crop surveys with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and the Indian Agricultural Statistics Research Institute suggested that a survey system should make use of the existing administrative framework. The differences in opinion led to acrimony and there was little interaction between Mahalanobis and agricultural research in later years.[21][22][23]/nIn later life, Mahalanobis was a member of the planning commission contributed prominently to newly independent India's five-year plans starting from the second. In the second five-year plan he emphasized industrialization on the basis of a two-sector model.[2] His variant of Wassily Leontief's Input-output model, the Mahalanobis model, was employed in the Second Five Year Plan, which worked towards the rapid industrialisation of India and with other colleagues at his institute, he played a key role in the development of a statistical infrastructure. He encouraged a project to assess deindustrialization in India and correct some previous census methodology errors and entrusted this project to Daniel Thorner.[24]/nIn the 1950s, Mahalanobis played a critical role in the campaign to bring India its first digital computers.[25]/nMahalanobis also had an abiding interest in cultural pursuits and served as secretary to Rabindranath Tagore (about whom he would write in the Journal of the Oriental Society of Australia), particularly during the latter's foreign travels, and also worked at his Visva-Bharati University, for some time. He received India's second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan from the Government of India for his contribution to science and services to the country./nMahalanobis died on 28 June 1972, a day before his seventy-ninth birthday. Even at this age, he was still active doing research work and discharging his duties as the secretary and director of the Indian Statistical Institute and as the honorary statistical advisor to the Cabinet of the Government of India.[citation needed]/nThe government of India decided in 2006 to celebrate Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis's birthday, 29 June, every year as \"National Statistics Day\" of India.[27][28]/nOn the occasion of his 125th birth anniversary on 29 June 2018, Indian Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu released a commemorative coin at a programme at ISI, Kolkata.[9]", "55737855": "Anton Deusing, in Latin Antonius Deusingius (October 15, 1612 \u2013 January 30, 1666) was a German physician, mathematician, and astronomer.[1][2]/nBorn in Moers in 1612, Deusing was an educated German physician, scholar of Oriental language, philosophy, physics, mathematics and astronomy.

He was the author of more than ninety books on a wide variety of subjects, including astronomy, clocks, engineering, mathematics, mechanics, optics and natural philosophy.[1]/nIn 1574 the Ottoman Sultan Murad III invited Taqi ad-Din to build an observatory in the Ottoman capital, Istanbul. Taqi ad-Din constructed instruments such as an armillary sphere and mechanical clocks that he used to observe the Great Comet of 1577. He also used European celestial and terrestrial globes that were delivered to Istanbul in gift exchanges./nHis major work from the use of his observatory is titled \"The tree of ultimate knowledge [in the end of time or the world] in the Kingdom of the Revolving Spheres: The astronomical tables of the King of Kings [Murad III]\" (Sidrat al-muntah al-afkar fi malk\u016bt al-falak al-daw\u0101r\u2013 al-zij al-Sh\u0101hinsh\u0101hi). The work was prepared according to the results of the observations carried out in Egypt and Istanbul in order to correct and complete Ulugh Beg's 15th century work, the Zij-i Sultani. The first 40 pages of the work dealt with calculations, followed by discussions of astronomical clocks, heavenly circles, and information on three eclipses which he observed in Cairo and Istanbul./nAs a polymath, Taqi al-Din wrote numerous books on astronomy, mathematics, mechanics, and theology. His method of finding coordinates of stars were reportedly so precise that he got better measurements than his contemporaries, Tycho Brahe and Nicolas Copernicus. Brahe is also thought to have been aware of Taqi al-Din's work.[2]/nTaqi ad-Din also described a steam turbine with the practical application of rotating a spit in 1551.[3] He worked on and created astronomical clocks for his observatory.[4] Taqi ad-Din also wrote a book on optics, in which he determined the light emitted from objects, proved the Law of Reflection observationally, and worked on refraction.[5]/nTaq\u012b al-D\u012bn was born in Damascus in 1526 according to most sources. His ethnicity has been described as Ottoman Arab,[6] Ottoman Kurdish,[7] Ottoman Turkish[8][9] and Ottoman Syrian.[10] In his treatise, titled \"Ray\u1e25\u0101nat al-r\u016b\u1e25\", Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn himself claimed descent from the Ayyubids[11][12] tracing his lineage back to the Ayyubid prince Nasir al-Din Mankarus ibn Nasih al-Din Khumartekin who ruled Abu Qubays in Syria during the 12th century.[13] The Encyclopaedia of Islam makes no mention of his ethnicity, simply calling him, \"...the most important astronomer of Ottoman Turkey\".[14]/nTaqi ad-Din's education started in theology and as he went on he would gain an interest in the rational sciences. Following his interest, he would begin to study the rational sciences in Damascus and Cairo. During that time he studied alongside his father Ma\u02bfruf Efendi. Al-D\u012bn went on to teach at various madaris and served as a qadi, or judge, in Palestine, Damascus, and Cairo. He stayed in Egypt and Damascus for some time and while he was there he created work in astronomy and mathematics. His work in these categories would eventually become important. He became a chief astronomer to the Sultan in 1571 a year after he came to Istanbul, replacing Mustafa ibn Ali al-Muwaqqit.[15][3]/nTaq\u012b al-D\u012bn maintained a strong bond with the people from the Ulama and statesmen. He would pass on information to Sultan Murad III who had an interest in astronomy but also in astrology. The information stated that Ulugh Beg Zij had particular observational errors. Al-D\u012bn made a suggestions that those errors could be fixed if there were new observations made. He also suggested that an observatory should be created in Istanbul to make that situation easier. Murad III would become a patron of the first observatory in Istanbul. He preferred that construction for the new observatory begin immediately. Since Murad III was the patron he would assist with finances for the project.[15]/nTaq\u012b al-D\u012bn continued his studies at the Galata Tower while this was going on. His studies would continue until 1577 at the nearly complete observatory, which was called Dar al-Rasad al-Jadid. This new observatory contained a library that held books which covered astronomy and mathematics. The observatory, built in the higher part of Tophane in Istanbul, was made of two separate buildings. One building was big and the other one was small. Al-D\u012bn possessed some of the instruments used in the old Islamic observatories. He had those instruments reproduced and also created new instruments which would be used for observational purposes. The staff at the new observatory consisted of sixteen people. Eight of them were observers or rasids, four of them were clerks, and the last four were assistants.[15]/nTaq\u012b al-D\u012bn approached his observations in a creative way and created new answers to astronomical problems due to the new strategies he created along with the new equipment he created as well. He would go on to create trigonometric tables based on decimal fractions. These tables placed the ecliptic at 23\u00b0 28' 40\". The current value was 23\u00b0 27' showing that al-D\u012bn's instruments and methods were more precise. Al-D\u012bn used a new method to calculate solar parameters and to determine the magnitude of the annual movement of the sun's apogee as 63 seconds. The known value today is 61 seconds. Copernicus came up with 24 seconds and Tycho Brahe had 45 seconds but al-D\u012bn was more accurate than both.[15]/nThe main purpose behind the observatory was to cater to the needs of the astronomers and provide a library and workshop so they could design and produce instruments. This observatory would become one of the largest ones in the Islamic world. It was complete in 1579. It would go on to run until January 22, 1580 which is when it was destroyed. Some say religious arguments was the reason why it was destroyed, but it really came down to political problems. A report by the grand vizier Sinan Pasha to Sultan Murad III goes into how the Sultan and the vizier attempted to keep Taq\u012b Ad-D\u012bn away from the ulama because it seemed like they wanted to take him to trial for heresy. The vizier informs the sultan that Taq\u012b Ad-D\u012bn wanted to go to Syria regardless of the sultan's orders. The vizier also warned the sultan that if Taq\u012b Ad-D\u012bn went there, there is a possibility that he would be noticed by the ulama who would take him to trial.[15]/nDespite Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn's originality, his influence seemed to be limited. There are only a small number of surviving copies of his works so they were not able to reach a wide variety of people. His commentaries that are known are very few. However, one of his works and a piece of a library that he owned reached western Europe pretty quickly. This was due to the manuscript collecting efforts of Jacob Golius, a Dutch professor of Arabic and mathematics at Leiden University. Golius traveled to Istanbul in the early seventeenth century. In 1629 he wrote a letter to Constantijn Huygens that talks about seeing Taq\u012b Ad-D\u012bn's work on optics in Istanbul. He argued that he was not able to get ahold of it from his friends even after all his efforts. He must have succeeded in acquiring it later since Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn's work on optics would eventually make it to the Bodleian Library as Marsh 119. It was originally in the Golius collection so it is clear that Golius eventually succeeded at acquiring it.[15]/nAccording to Salomon Schweigger, the chaplain of Habsburg ambassador Johann Joachim von Sinzendorf, Taqi al-Din was a charlatan who deceived Sultan Murad III and had him spent enormous resources.[16]/nAt the age of 59, after authoring more than ninety books, Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn passed away in 1585.[17]/nTaq\u012b al-D\u012bn was both the founder and director of the Constantinople Observatory, which is also known as the Istanbul Observatory.[18] This observatory is frequently said to be one of Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn's most important contributions to sixteenth-century Islamic and Ottoman astronomy.[3] In fact, it is known as one of the largest observatories in Islamic history. It is often compared to Tycho Brahe's Uraniborg Observatory, which was said to have been the home to the best instruments of its time in Europe. As a matter of fact, Brahe and Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn have frequently been compared for their work in sixteenth-century astronomy.[3] The founding of the Constantinople Observatory began when Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn returned to Istanbul in 1570, after spending 20 years in Egypt developing his astronomy and mathematical knowledge.[18] Shortly after his return, Sultan Sel\u012bm II appointed Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn as the head astronomer (M\u00fcneccimba\u015f\u0131),  following the death of the previous head astronomer Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 ibn \u0481Al\u012b al-Muwaqqit in 1571.[18]/nDuring the early years of his position as head astronomer, Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn worked in both the Galata Tower and a building overlooking Tophane.[18] While working in these buildings, he began to gain the support and trust of many important Turkish officials. These newfound relationships lead to an imperial edict in 1569 from Sultan Murad III, which called for the construction of the Constantinople Observatory. This observatory became home to many important books and instruments, it had sixteen assistants who helped with the making of scientific instruments, as well as many renowned scholars of the time.[17] While there is not much known of the architectural characteristics of the building, there are many depictions of the scholars and astronomical instruments present in the observatory. It was from this observatory that Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn discovered the Great Comet of 1577, Murad III taught of the comet as a bad omen on the war with the Safavids (he also blamed Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn for the plague that was occurring at the time).[17] Due to political conflict, this observatory was short lived.[19] It was closed in 1579 and, was demolished entirely by the state on 22 January 1580, only 11 short years after the imperial edict which called for its construction.[18]/nThe rise and fall of Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn and his observatory depended on political issues that surrounded him. Due to his father's occupation as a professor at the Damascene College of law Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn spent much of his life in Syria and Egypt. During his trips to Istanbul he was able to make connections with many scholar-jurists. He was also able to use the private library of the Grand Vizier of the time, Semiz Ali Pasha. He then began working under Sultan Murad III's new Grand Vizier's, private mentor Sa'deddin. Continuing his research on observations of the heavens while in Egypt Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn used the Galata tower and Sa'deddin's private residence. Although Murad III was the one who commanded an observatory to be built it was actually Sa'deddin who brought the idea to him knowing about his interest in science.[20] The Sultan ultimately would provide Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn with everything he needed from financial assistance for the physical buildings, to intellectual assistance making sure he had easy access to many types of books he would need. When the Sultan decided to create the observatory he saw it as a way to show off the power his monarchy had besides just financially backing it. Murad III showed his power by bringing Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn and some of the most accomplished men in the field of astronomy together to work towards one goal and not only have them work well together but also make progress in the field.[20] Murad III made sure that there was proof of his accomplishments by having his court historiographer Seyyid Lokman keep very detailed records of the work going on at the observatory. Seyyid Lokman wrote that his sultan's monarchy was much more powerful than others in Iraq, Persia, and Anatolia.[20] He also claimed that Murad III was above other monarchs because the results of the observatory were new to the world and replaced many others.[20]/nTaq\u012b al-D\u012bn used a variety of instruments to aid in his work at the observatory. Some were instruments that were already in use from European Astronomers while others he invented himself. While working in this observatory, Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn not only operated many previously created instruments and techniques, but he also developed numerous new ones.[18]  Of these novel inventions, the automatic-mechanical clock is regarded as one of the most important developed in the Constantinople Observatory.[3]/nBefore the sixteenth century European mechanical clocks were not in high demand. This lack of demand was brought on by the extremely high prices and the lack of preciseness needed by the population who had to calculate when they would have to have the prayer. The use of hourglasses, water clocks, and sundials was more than enough to meet their needs.[22]/nIt was not until around 1547 that the Ottomans started creating a high demand for them. Initially, it was started by the gifts brought by the Austrians but this would end up starting a market for the clocks. European clockmakers began to create clocks designed to the tastes and needs of the Ottoman people. They did this by showing both the phases of the moon and by utilizing Ottoman numbers.[22]/nDue to this high demand for mechanical clocks, Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn was asked by the Grand Vizier to create a clock that would show exactly when the call to prayer was. This would lead him to write his first book on the construction of mechanical clocks called, \"al-Kawakib al-Durriya fi Bengamat al-Dawriyya\" in 1563 A.D. which he used throughout his research at the short-lived observatory.[23] He believed that it would be advantageous to bring a \"true hermetic and distilled perception of the motion of the heavenly bodies.\"[24] In order to get a better understanding of how clocks ran Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn took the time to gain knowledge from many European clock makers as well as going into the treasury of Semiz Ali Pasha and learning anything he could from the many clocks he owned.[22]/nOf the clocks in the Grand Vizier's treasury Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn examined three different types. Those three were weight-driven, spring-driven, and driven by lever escapement. He wrote of these three types of watches but also made comments on pocket watches and astronomical ones. As Chief Astronomer, Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn created a mechanical astronomical clock. This clock was made to permit more precise measurements at the Constantinople observatory. As stated above the creation of this clock was thought to be one of the most important astronomical discoveries of the sixteenth century. Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn constructed a mechanical clock with three dials which show the hours, minutes, and seconds, with each minute consisting of five seconds.[4] After this clock it is not known whether Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn's work in mechanical clocks was ever continued, given that much of the clockmaking after that time in the Ottoman Empire was taken over by Europeans./nIn 1551 Taq\u012b al-D\u012bn described a self-rotating spit that is important in the history of the steam turbine. In Al-Turuq al-samiyya fi al-alat al-ruhaniyya (The Sublime Methods of Spiritual Machines) al-D\u012bn describes this machine as well as some practical applications for it. The spit is rotated by directing steam into the vanes which then turns the wheel at the end of the axle.[25] Al-D\u012bn also described four water-raising machines. The first two are animal driven water pumps. The third and fourth are both driven by a paddle wheel. The third is a slot-rod pump while the fourth is a six-cylinder pump. The vertical pistons of the final machine are operated by cams and trip-hammers, run by the paddle wheel.[25] The descriptions of these machines predates many of the more modern engines. The screw pump, for example, that al-D\u012bn describes predates Agricola, whose description of the rag and chain pump was published in 1556. The two pump engine, which was first described by al-Jazar\u012b, was also the basis of the steam engine.[26]", "56294925": "John Rogers Musselman (1 December 1890, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania \u2013 8 August 1968, Cleveland) was an American mathematician, specializing in algebraic geometry and known for Musselman's theorem./nJ. R. Musselman received his A.B. in 1910 from Pennsylvania College and his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University in 1916 under Arthur Byron Coble with thesis A set of eight self-associated points in space.[1] Musselman was a teaching assistant at Gettysburg Academy from 1910 to 1912 and an instructor in mathematics at the University of Illinois in 1916\u20131918 and then at Washington University in St. Louis in 1920\u20131928. He was a professor mathematics at Western Reserve University from 1928 until his retirement as professor emeritus in 1961.[2]/nHe was an Invited Speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1936 in Oslo.[3]", "97805": "Isaac Barrow (October 1630 \u2013 4 May 1677) was an English Christian theologian and mathematician who is generally given credit for his early role in the development of infinitesimal calculus; in particular, for proof of the fundamental theorem of calculus.[1] His work centered on the properties of the tangent; Barrow was the first to calculate the tangents of the kappa curve. He is also notable for being the inaugural holder of the prestigious Lucasian Professorship of Mathematics, a post later held by his student, Isaac Newton./nBarrow was born in London. He was the son of Thomas Barrow, a linen draper by trade. In 1624, Thomas married Ann, daughter of William Buggin of North Cray, Kent and their son Isaac was born in 1630. It appears that Barrow was the only child of this union\u2014certainly the only child to survive infancy.  Ann died around 1634, and the widowed father sent the lad to his grandfather, Isaac, the Cambridgeshire J.P., who resided at Spinney Abbey.[2]  Within two years, however, Thomas remarried; the new wife was Katherine Oxinden, sister of Henry Oxinden of Maydekin, Kent. From this marriage, he had at least one daughter, Elizabeth (born 1641), and a son, Thomas, who apprenticed to Edward Miller, skinner, and won his release in 1647, emigrating to Barbados in 1680.[3]/nIsaac went to school first at Charterhouse (where he was so turbulent and pugnacious that his father was heard to pray that if it pleased God to take any of his children he could best spare Isaac), and subsequently to Felsted School, where he settled and learned under the brilliant puritan Headmaster Martin Holbeach who ten years previously had educated John Wallis.[4] Having learnt Greek, Hebrew, Latin and logic at Felsted, in preparation for university studies,[5] he continued his education at Trinity College, Cambridge; he enrolled there because of an offer of support from an unspecified member of the Walpole family, \"an offer that was perhaps prompted by the Walpoles' sympathy for Barrow's adherence to the Royalist cause.\"[6] His uncle and namesake Isaac Barrow, afterwards Bishop of St Asaph, was a Fellow of Peterhouse.  He took to hard study, distinguishing himself in classics and mathematics; after taking his degree in 1648, he was elected to a fellowship in 1649.[7] Barrow received an MA from Cambridge in 1652 as a student of James Duport; he then resided for a few years in college, and became candidate for the Greek Professorship at Cambridge, but in 1655 having refused to sign the Engagement to uphold the Commonwealth, he obtained travel grants to go abroad.[8]/nHe spent the next four years travelling across France, Italy, Smyrna and Constantinople, and after many adventures returned to England in 1659. He was known for his courageousness. Particularly noted is the occasion of his having saved the ship he was upon, by the merits of his own prowess, from capture by pirates. He is described as \"low in stature, lean, and of a pale complexion,\" slovenly in his dress, and having a committed and long-standing habit of tobacco use (an inveterate smoker). In respect to his courtly activities his aptitude to wit earned him favour with Charles II, and the respect of his fellow courtiers. In his writings one might find accordingly, a sustained and somewhat stately eloquence. He was an altogether impressive personage of the time, having lived a blameless life in which he exercised his conduct with due care and conscientiousness.[9]/nOn the Restoration in 1660, he was ordained and appointed to the Regius Professorship of Greek at the University of Cambridge. In 1662, he was made professor of geometry at Gresham College, and in 1663 was selected as the first occupier of the Lucasian chair at Cambridge. During his tenure of this chair he published two mathematical works of great learning and elegance, the first on geometry and the second on optics. In 1669 he resigned his professorship in favour of Isaac Newton.[10] About this time, Barrow composed his Expositions of the Creed, The Lord's Prayer, Decalogue, and Sacraments.  For the remainder of his life he devoted himself to the study of divinity. He was made a Doctor of Divinity by Royal mandate in 1670, and two years later Master of Trinity College (1672), where he founded the library, and held the post until his death./nHis earliest work was a complete edition of the Elements of Euclid, which he issued in Latin in 1655, and in English in 1660; in 1657 he published an edition of the Data. His lectures, delivered in 1664, 1665, and 1666, were published in 1683 under the title Lectiones Mathematicae; these are mostly on the metaphysical basis for mathematical truths. His lectures for 1667 were published in the same year, and suggest the analysis by which Archimedes was led to his chief results. In 1669 he issued his Lectiones Opticae et Geometricae. It is said in the preface that Newton revised and corrected these lectures, adding matter of his own, but it seems probable from Newton's remarks in the fluxional controversy that the additions were confined to the parts which dealt with optics. This, which is his most important work in mathematics, was republished with a few minor alterations in 1674. In 1675 he published an edition with numerous comments of the first four books of the On Conic Sections of Apollonius of Perga, and of the extant works of Archimedes and Theodosius of Bithynia./nIn the optical lectures many problems connected with the reflection and refraction of light are treated with ingenuity. The geometrical focus of a point seen by reflection or refraction is defined; and it is explained that the image of an object is the locus of the geometrical foci of every point on it.  Barrow also worked out a few of the easier properties of thin lenses, and considerably simplified the Cartesian explanation of the rainbow./nBarrow was the first to find the integral of the secant function in closed form, thereby proving a conjecture that was well-known at the time./nBarrow died unmarried in London at the early age of 46, and was buried at Westminster Abbey. John Aubrey, in the Brief Lives, attributes his death to an opium addiction acquired during his residence in Turkey./nBesides the works above mentioned, he wrote other important treatises on mathematics, but in literature his place is chiefly supported by his sermons,[11] which are masterpieces of argumentative eloquence, while his Treatise on the Pope's Supremacy is regarded as one of the most perfect specimens of controversy in existence. Barrow's character as a man was in all respects worthy of his great talents, though he had a strong vein of eccentricity./nThe geometrical lectures contain some new ways of determining the areas and tangents of curves. The most celebrated of these is the method given for the determination of tangents to curves, and this is sufficiently important to require a detailed notice, because it illustrates the way in which Barrow, Hudde and Sluze were working on the lines suggested by Fermat towards the methods of the differential calculus./nFermat had observed that the tangent at a point P on a curve was determined if one other point besides P on it were known; hence, if the length of the subtangent MT could be found (thus determining the point T), then the line TP would be the required tangent. Now Barrow remarked that if the abscissa and ordinate at a point Q adjacent to P were drawn, he got a small triangle PQR (which he called the\ndifferential triangle, because its sides QR and RP were the differences of the abscissae and ordinates of P and Q), so that\nK/nTo find QR\u00a0: RP he supposed that x, y\nwere the co-ordinates of P, and x \u2212 e, y\n\u2212 a those of Q (Barrow actually used p for x and m for y, but this article uses the standard modern notation).  Substituting the co-ordinates of Q in the equation of the curve, and neglecting the squares and higher powers of e and a as compared with their first powers, he obtained e\u00a0: a. The ratio a/e was subsequently (in accordance with a suggestion made by Sluze) termed the angular coefficient of the tangent at the point./nBarrow applied this method to the curves/nIt will be sufficient here to take as an illustration the simpler case of the parabola y2 = px.\nUsing the notation given above, we have for the point P, y2 = px; and for the point Q:/nSubtracting we get/nBut, if a be an infinitesimal quantity,\na2 must be infinitely smaller and therefore may be neglected\nwhen compared with the quantities 2ay and pe.  Hence/nTherefore,/nHence/nThis is exactly the procedure of the differential calculus, except that there we\nhave a rule by which we can get the ratio a/e or dy/dx directly without the labour of going through a calculation similar to the above for every separate case.", "97807": "Jules Richard (12 August 1862 \u2013 14 October 1956) was a French mathematician who worked mainly in geometry but his name is most commonly associated with Richard's paradox./nRichard was born in Blet, in the Cher d\u00e9partement./nHe taught at the lyc\u00e9es of Tours, Dijon and Ch\u00e2teauroux. He obtained his doctorate, at age of 39, from the Facult\u00e9 des Sciences in Paris. His thesis of 126 pages concerns Fresnel's wave-surface. Richard worked mainly on the foundations of mathematics and geometry, relating to works by Hilbert, von Staudt and M\u00e9ray./nIn a more philosophical treatise about the nature of axioms of geometry Richard discusses and rejects the following basic principles:/nThe latter approach was essentially that proposed by Kant. Richard arrived at the result that the notion of identity of two objects and the invariability of an object are too vague and need to be specified more precisely. This should be done by axioms./nAxioms are propositions, the task of which is to make precise the notion of identity of two objects pre-existing in our mind./nFurther according to Richard, it is the aim of science to explain the material universe. And although non-Euclidean geometry had not found any applications (Albert Einstein finished his general theory of relativity only in 1915), Richard already stated clairvoyantly:/nOne sees that having admitted the notion of angle, one is free to choose the notion of straight line in such a way that one or another of the three geometries is true./nRichard corresponded with Giuseppe Peano and Henri Poincar\u00e9. He became known to more than a small group of specialists by formulating his paradox which was extensively use by Poincar\u00e9 to attack set theory whereupon the advocates of set theory had to refute these attacks./nHe died in 1956 in Ch\u00e2teauroux, in the Indre d\u00e9partement, at the age of 94./nThe paradox was first stated in 1905 in a letter to Louis Olivier, director of the Revue g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des sciences pures et appliqu\u00e9es. It was published in 1905 in the article Les Principes des math\u00e9matiques et le probl\u00e8me des ensembles. The Principia Mathematica by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell quote it together with six other paradoxes concerning the problem of self-reference. In one of the most important compendia of mathematical logic, compiled by Jean van Heijenoort, Richard's article is translated into English. The paradox can be interpreted as an application of Cantor's diagonal argument. It inspired Kurt G\u00f6del and Alan Turing to their famous works. Kurt G\u00f6del considered his incompleteness theorem as analogous to Richard's paradox which, in the original version runs as follows:/nLet E be the set of real numbers that can be defined by a finite number of words. This set is denumerable. Let p be the nth decimal of the nth number of the set E; we form a number N having zero for the integral part and p + 1 for the nth decimal, if p is not equal either to 8 or 9, and unity in the contrary case. This number N does not belong to the set E because it differs from any number of this set, namely from the nth number by the nth digit. But N has been defined by a finite number of words. It should therefore belong to the set E. That is a contradiction./nRichard never presented his paradox in another form, but meanwhile there exist several different versions, some of which being only very loosely connected to the original. For the sake of completeness they may be stated here./n(A) The version given in Principia Mathematica by Whitehead and Russell is similar to Richard's original version, alas not quite as exact. Here only the digit 9 is replaced by the digit 0, such that identities like 1.000... = 0.999... can spoil the result./n(B) Berry's Paradox, first mentioned in the Principia Mathematica as fifth of seven paradoxes, is credited to Mr. G. G. Berry of the Bodleian Library. It uses the least integer not nameable in fewer than nineteen syllables; in fact, in English it denotes 111,777. But \"the least integer not nameable in fewer than nineteen syllables\" is itself a name consisting of eighteen syllables; hence the least integer not nameable in fewer than nineteen syllables can be named in eighteen syllables, which is a contradiction/n(C) Berry's Paradox with letters instead of syllables is often related to the set of all natural numbers which can be defined by less than 100 (or any other large number) letters. As the natural numbers are a well-ordered set there must be the least number which cannot be defined by less than 100 letters. But this number was just defined by 65 letters including spaces./n(D) K\u00f6nig's Paradox was also published in 1905 by Julius K\u00f6nig. All real numbers which can be defined by a finite number of words form a subset of the real numbers. If the real numbers can be well-ordered, then there must be a first real number (according to this order) which cannot be defined by a finite number of words. But the first real number which cannot be defined by a finite number of words has just been defined by a finite number of words./n(E) The smallest natural number without interesting properties acquires an interesting property by this very lack of any interesting properties./n(F) A loan of the Paradox of Grelling and Nelson. The number of all finite definitions is countable. In lexical order we obtain a sequence of definitions D1,  D2, D3,  ... Now, it may happen that a definition defines its own number. This would be the case if D1 read \"the smallest natural number\". It may happen, that a definition does not describe its own number. This would be the case if D2 read \"the smallest natural number\". Also the sentence \"this definition does not describe its number\" is a finite definition. Let it be Dn. Is n described by Dn. If yes, then no, and if no, then yes. The dilemma is irresolvable. (This version is described in more detail in another article, Richard's paradox.)/nGeorg Cantor wrote in a letter to David Hilbert:/nHere Cantor is in error. Today we know that there are uncountably many real numbers without the possibility of a finite definition./nErnst Zermelo comments Richard's argument:/nZermelo points to the reason why Richard's paradox fails. His last statement, however, is impossible to satisfy. A real number with infinitely many digits, which are not determined by some \"rule\", has an infinitely large contents of information. Such a number could only be identified by a short name if there were only one or few of them existing. If there exist uncountably many, as is the case, an identification is impossible.", "69434896": "Nicole Leonie Jean Marie De Grande-De Kimpe[1] (7 September 1936 \u2013 23 July 2008) was a Belgian mathematician known as a pioneer of p-adic functional analysis, and particularly for her work on locally convex topological vector spaces over fields with non-Archimedean valuations.[2]/nDe Grande-De Kimpe was born on 7 September 1936 in Antwerp, the only child of a dockworker living in Hoboken, Antwerp, where she grew up, went to high school, and learned to play the violin.

During his time in Cambridge, he had been greatly influenced by Bertrand Russell's work on the logical foundations of mathematics and in 1922 he published his Prolegomena to Analytical Geometry. It is a detailed treatise on foundations of analytical geometry, including complex geometry, providing an axiomatic development of the subject./nIn 1914, as a visiting lecturer, he travelled to India, where, in response to a request from Hardy, he managed to persuade the Indian mathematician Ramanujan to accompany him back to England, thus playing a vital role in the initiation of one of the most celebrated mathematical collaborations of the last hundred years. Ramanujan later befriended Hardy./nNeville's algorithm for polynomial interpolation is widely used./nNeville did not join the army when the First World War erupted in the summer of 1914. Poor eyesight would have prevented him from active service, but he declared his opposition to the conflict and refused to fight. It was probably this pacifist declaration that resulted in the non-renewal of his Trinity fellowship in 1919./nOn leaving Cambridge, he was appointed to the chair of mathematics at University College, Reading. In a few years, his work enabled the institution to receive a university charter and award its own degrees from 1926./nNeville had a keen interest in elliptic functions, having taught the subject to postgraduate students at Reading since the 1920s. He believed that the subject's recent decline in popularity was due to its dependence on a mass of complicated formulae, a variety of differing and confusing notations, and an artificial definition relying on a familiarity with theta functions. A period of recuperation from an illness in 1940 gave him the opportunity to put several years of lecture notes into publishable form. The result was his best-known work: Jacobian Elliptic Functions (1944)./nBy starting with the Weierstrass p-function and associating with it a group of doubly periodic functions with two simple poles, he was able to give a simple derivation of the Jacobian elliptic functions, as well as modifying the existing notation to provide a more systematic approach to the subject. Unfortunately, it failed to achieve its author's stated intention \"to restore the Jacobian functions to the elementary curriculum\" (NEVILLE 1951, vi) and its appearance came too late to have any real effect on the dominance of the classical approach to elliptic functions./nNeville retired from the University of Reading in 1954, after which he continued to publish papers in the Mathematical Gazette. He was working on a sequel to his book on elliptic functions when he died on 22 August 1961. One obituary says with regret, \"so brilliant and versatile a talent could have been harnessed to some major mathematical investigation\"[2]/nNeville was an active member of several mathematical and scientific bodies. Elected to membership of the London Mathematical Society in 1913, he served on its council from 1926 to 1931. He regularly attended meetings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, being President of Section A (Mathematics and Physics) in 1950. He also chaired its Mathematical Tables Committee from 1931 to 1947 and, when it came under the auspices of the Royal Society, he contributed two sets of tables, on Farey series of order 1025 (1950)[3] and Rectangular-polar conversion tables (1956).", "23166485": "Benjamin Franklin Finkel (July 5, 1865 \u2013 February 5, 1947) was a mathematician and educator most remembered today as the founder of the American Mathematical Monthly journal.

In 1888 he copyrighted A Mathematical Solution Book. The purpose of the book was to provide mathematics teachers a text utilizing a systematic method of problem solving, \"The Step Method\", representing a chain of reasoning, in logical order, to arrive at the correct result.[1] The first edition was postponed until 1893, due to financial problems of the original publisher.[2] The book's preface stated that the work was based upon eight years of teaching in the public schools.  This was followed by following editions in 1897, 1899 and 1902.[3] In 1895 he became professor of mathematics and physics at Drury University, then known as Drury College.

K. Mlodzievsky.[1][4] At some point she married and was widowed during the Russian Civil War, thereafter going by the surname Tsuberbiller.[6] Tsuberbiller was dedicated to her students' education, establishing both a mathematics library and reading room to facilitate further study. She counseled and tutored students and worked to popularize the study of math, while she was working in the women's courses.[4] In the 1920s, she began teaching at the First Moscow State University.[1] At the beginning of 1923, Tsuberbiller met and became friends with Sophia Parnok. The exact nature of her relationship with Parnok is unknown as, while she occupied a significant place in the poet's life, Parnok did not describe Tsuberbiller in the same sexual context as her lovers. Instead, Tsuberbiller was a protector,[7] as expressed in the poem cycle Half-voiced, which describes Tsuberbiller as a type of guardian angel.[8] By 1925, she had become Parnok's closest friend, and when Parnok's lover Lyudmila Vladimirovna Erarskaya was hospitalized for a mental break, Tsuberbiller was the one to whom Parnok turned to regain her equilibrium.[9] The following year, Parnok moved in with Tsuberbiller on Neopalimovsky Lane at Smolensky Boulevard,[10] though Tsuberbiller was already overworked, providing care for both her mother and her brother, who was at the time unemployed.[11]/nIn 1927, Tsuberbiller published the first edition of \u0417\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0438 \u0438 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0436\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043f\u043e \u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0438 (Problems and Exercises in Analytic Geometry), which became a standard text in Soviet high schools. The book has been reprinted in Russian more than thirty-five times and has been translated into Chinese, Czech, German, and Polish. It is still a standard text in Russian high schools and technical institutions.[1][4][12] That same year, when Nina Vedeneyeva's son was banished from his studies, Tsuberbiller provided him with textbooks so that he could continue his mathematics preparations, which may have been the event when Vedeneyeva and Parnok met.[12] By 1928, Parnok had begun to have serious health issues and Tsuberbiller, who was also ill took her to Novhorod-Siverskyi in Ukraine for the summer.[13] The following spring, her brother died and his twin daughters became Tsuberbiller's obligation.[14] In 1930, Tsuberbiller became a professor at the Institute of Fine Chemical Technology[1] and at the end of that same year, she and Parnok moved to a new apartment on  Nikitsky Boulevard with more room where the couple could regularly entertain colleagues of Tsuberbiller's.[15]/nTsuberbiller indulged Parnok and allowed her freedom,[16] so in 1931 when Parnok fell into an unreciprocated passion for Maria Maksakova[17] and then the following year became intimate with Vedeneyeva, she remained silent about the affairs.[16] During Parnok's last, fatal illness, she continued living with Tsuberbiller, who was with Parnok and Vedeneyeva when the poet died in August 1933.[18] Tsuberbiller took responsibility for Parnok's literary estate upon Parnok's death.[4][19] Soon after Parnok' death, Tsuberbiller began a relationship with Concordia Antarova,[19] a noted opera singer who later became interested in Theosophy and published books.[20] In 1936, she was promoted to department head of Higher Mathematics and served in that post until 1965. Between 1943 and 1966, she also served as head of the Department of Geometry at Moscow University.[19]/nTsuberbiller became one of the Honored Scientists of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in 1955.[1] As she had with Parnok, Tsuberbiller took care of Antarova through various illnesses until her death in 1959.[21] She retired from the university in 1969.[4]/nTsuberbiller died on 28 September 1975 in Moscow and was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery near Antarova.[19] In 2014, Tsuberbiller's portrait was painted by Boston-based artist Ria Brodell for their series Butch Heroes, which celebrates \"people who were assigned female at birth, but who presented as masculine, and had documented relationships with women.\" The collection was exhibited at Gallery Kayafas in Boston in 2017.[22]", "31784480": "Achille Pierre Dionis du S\u00e9jour (January 11, 1734 \u2013 August 22, 1794) was a French astronomer and mathematician.[1]/nDionis du S\u00e9jour was born in Paris and was a distant relative of surgeon and anatomist Pierre Dionis.

Faulkner joined the Eastern Question Association in 1876, and invited Morris to the 1883 meeting in University College hall where Morris announced his conversion to socialism. Both joined the Socialist League in 1885.

Today, he is usually referred to by his Latin name Vitello Thuringopolonis, often shortened to Vitello./nVitello's exact birth-name and birthplace are uncertain. He was most likely born around 1230 in Silesia, in the vicinity of Legnica.[1] His mother came from a Polish knightly house, while his father was a German settler from Thuringia. He called himself, in Latin, \"Thuringorum et Polonorum filius\" \u2014 \"a son of Thuringians and Poles.\"  He studied at Padua University about 1260, then went on to Viterbo.  He became friends with William of Moerbeke, the translator of Aristotle from Greek language into Latin. Vitello's major surviving work on optics, Perspectiva, completed in about 1270\u201378,[2] was dedicated to William. In 1284 he described the reflection and refraction of light.[3]/nVitello's Perspectiva was largely based on the work of the polymath Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham; d. ca. 1041) and in turn influenced later scientists, in particular Johannes Kepler. Vitello's treatise in optics was closely linked to the Latin version of Ibn al-Haytham's Arabic opus: Kitab al-Manazir (The Book of Optics; De Aspectibus or Perspectivae), and both were printed in the Friedrich Risner edition Opticae Thesaurus (Basel, 1572).[4]/nVitello's Perspectiva, which rested on Ibn al-Haytham's research in optics, influenced also the Renaissance theories of perspective. Lorenzo Ghiberti's Commentario terzo (Third Commentary) was based on an Italian translation of Vitello's Latin Perspectiva.[5]/nVitello's treatise also contains much material in psychology, outlining views that are close to modern notions on the association of ideas and on the subconscious./nPerspectiva also includes Platonic metaphysical discussions. Vitello argues that there are intellectual and corporeal bodies, connected by causality (corresponding to the Idealist doctrine of the universal and the actual), emanating from God in the form of Divine Light. Light itself is, for Vitello, the first of all sensible entities, and his views on light are similar to those held by Roger Bacon, though he is closer in this to Alhazen's legacy.[6]/nIn Perspectiva, Vitello refers to other works that he had written.

He was born on January 9, 1873, in Iller, a village in the S\u00f8nderborg Municipality of Denmark.[1][2][3] In 1881, the family moved to Copenhagen.[2] In 1888, he passed with high honors the entrance examinations for the University of Copenhagen,[4] but his family was unable to afford sending him to the university.[1] Instead, later the same year, they moved again to the US. He worked for several years as a lumberman, a railway worker, a traveling surveyor, and then as a government draftsman in Bellingham, Washington.[1][4][5]/nIn 1894, he became a student at Stanford University,[1] which admitted its first students in 1891[3] and did not charge tuition at the time. He did not have a high school diploma, so he had to be admitted as a special student, with a letter of support from his drafting supervisor. By 1895 he had become a regular student,[6] and he earned a bachelor's degree there in 1896,[1][4] one of three graduating mathematics students that year.[6] He stayed for a master's degree in 1897,[1][4] and in the same year was appointed an instructor at Stanford.[6] It was customary to travel to Europe for doctoral study in mathematics, and with financial support from Stanford professor Rufus L. Green he traveled to Leipzig University and completed a Ph.D. there in 1898.[1][4][6] His doctoral dissertation, On a Certain Class of Groups of Transformation in Three-dimensional Space, was supervised by Sophus Lie, and he graduated summa cum laude.[1][4][6][7] Eric Temple Bell suggests that he may have chosen to work with Lie, among other famous mathematicians of the time, because of their shared Scandinavian heritage, and by doing so he set the course of his life's work.[2]/nReturning to Stanford, he became a full professor by 1913, and department chair from 1927 until his retirement in 1938.[1][4][5] He also visited the University of Chicago in 1911 and Columbia University in 1924 and 1925,[1] represented the US at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1932 and 1936,[5] and served as vice-president of the American Mathematical Society in 1912.[6]/nBlichfeldt remained unmarried throughout his life.[2] He died on November 16, 1945, in Palo Alto, California, of complications following an operation for a heart attack.[1][5][2]/nBlichfeldt made his first mathematical publication, on Heronian triangles, as an undergraduate in 1896.[2][A1]/nBlichfeldt's work in group theory includes an improved bound for the Jordan\u2013Schur theorem, that finite linear groups have normal abelian subgroups of index bounded by a function of their dimension,[8][9][A2] and a result relating the order of a permutation group to the numbers of fixed points of its elements.[10][A3]  With George Abram Miller and Leonard Eugene Dickson, Blichfeldt wrote a comprehensive 1916 text on what was known at the time in the theory of finite groups.[B1] It was divided into three parts by the specializations of the authors: Miller contributed material on abstract groups and permutation groups, Dickson described Galois groups, and Blichfeldt wrote the portions of the book concerning groups of complex linear transformations (in modern terms, the representation theory of finite groups).[11] Blichfeldt's own book, published a year later,[B2] expanded his exposition of linear transformation groups.[12] Both books detail his classification of the four-dimensional group representations.[4][12][6][11]/nBlichtfeld's later work largely concerned lattices, the geometry of numbers, sphere packings, and quadratic forms.

In 1929\u20131933 he was educated at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where he became a pupil of Max Born, with a break for the academic year 1930\u201331, when he worked as a school teacher; he also studied in Paris and Zurich for some time. After the Nazis came to power, Born left Germany and invited Weiss to the University of Cambridge; Weiss joined Born in the autumn of 1933 (his mother and sister had already moved to England). After Born moved to Edinburgh, the young scientist continued work under the direction of Paul Dirac and in 1936 received his PhD with a thesis \"The Notion of Conjugate Variables in the Calculus of Variations for Multiple Integrals and its Application to the Quantisation of Field Physics\". In the thesis and several subsequent publications, Weiss has developed a scheme of canonical quantization of field theories, in particular, he generalized commutation relations for the field variables. He focused primarily on general mathematical formalism for the quantization of field theories. Weiss's method (the so-called parameter formalism), based on the analysis of the parameters labelling an arbitrary hypersurface, was used by Dirac in the late 1940s to develop canonical quantization of constrained Hamiltonian systems, and later \u2013 for the development of the canonical quantum gravity (first of all, in the works of Peter Bergmann and Bryce DeWitt)./nAfter defending his thesis, Weiss stayed for two years in Cambridge, including the 1937/38 academic year, when he taught a course in quantum electrodynamics. Then there were two semesters spent in the Queen's University Belfast, where he lectured on mathematical mechanics. During this time, he wrote a long article giving the quaternion equations for the special relativity and for the motion of a charged particle emitting electromagnetic radiation. After the Second World War broke out, on 5 September 1939, Weiss expressed his desire to work for national defense. However, at that time, he did not have British citizenship, so on 12 May 1940, during a visit to Cambridge he was interned and in July sent to a special camp in Quebec. There he, along with many colleagues (Max Perutz, Hermann Bondi, Walter Heitler, Klaus Fuchs) lectured at the improvised university organized by interned scientists. Meanwhile, his sister Helene with the help of the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning has taken a number of steps to bring back her brother; Born, Dirac, Paul Ewald, Ralph Fowler and other colleagues wrote on his behalf. Finally, in December 1940, it was decided to release Weiss, and in January 1941 he had left the camp./nIn February 1941, Weiss was appointed a lecturer in applied mathematics at Westfield College, and held this position until 1950. In August 1946, the scientist applied for citizenship and in June of the following year became a British citizen. In 1950\u201351 he worked for some time at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and soon moved permanently to the United States. Until 1957 he worked as an applied mathematician for General Electric. One of the directions of his work at this time was the use of the methods of operations research to solve business problems. In the years 1958\u20131960, Weiss worked for Aviation Corporation, before joining to the mathematical faculty of Wayne State University in Detroit, where he worked until his death in 1991./nWhile working in London, Weiss married Marliese Oppa, they had two children.

Buffon published thirty-six quarto volumes of his Histoire Naturelle during his lifetime, with additional volumes based on his notes and further research being published in the two decades following his death.[1]/nErnst Mayr wrote that \"Truly, Buffon was the father of all thought in natural history in the second half of the 18th century\".[2] Credited with being one of the first naturalists to recognize ecological succession, he was later forced by the theology committee at the University of Paris to recant his theories about geological history and animal evolution because they contradicted the biblical narrative of Creation.[3][4]/nGeorges Louis Leclerc (later Comte de Buffon) was born at Montbard, in the province of Burgundy to Benjamin Fran\u00e7ois Leclerc, a minor local official in charge of the salt tax and Anne-Christine Marlin also from a family of civil servants. Georges was named after his mother's uncle (his godfather) Georges Blaisot, the tax-farmer of the Duke of Savoy for all of Sicily. In 1714 Blaisot died childless, leaving a considerable fortune to his seven-year-old godson. Benjamin Leclerc then purchased an estate containing the nearby village of Buffon and moved the family to Dijon acquiring various offices there as well as a seat in the Dijon Parlement./nGeorges attended the Jesuit College of Godrans in Dijon from the age of ten onwards. From 1723 to 1726 he then studied law in Dijon, the prerequisite for continuing the family tradition in civil service. In 1728 Georges left Dijon to study mathematics and medicine at the University of Angers in France. At Angers in 1730 he made the acquaintance of the young English Duke of Kingston, who was on his grand tour of Europe, and traveled with him on a large and expensive entourage for a year and a half through southern France and parts of Italy.[5]/nThere are persistent but completely undocumented rumors from this period about duels, abductions and secret trips to England. In 1732 after the death of his mother and before the impending remarriage of his father, Georges left Kingston and returned to Dijon to secure his inheritance. Having added 'de Buffon' to his name while traveling with the Duke, he repurchased the village of Buffon, which his father had meanwhile sold off. With a fortune of about 80,000 livres Buffon set himself up in Paris to pursue science, at first primarily mathematics and mechanics, and the increase of his fortune.[6]/nIn 1732 he moved to Paris, where he made the acquaintance of Voltaire and other intellectuals. He lived in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, with Gilles-Fran\u00e7ois Boulduc, first apothecary of the King, professor of chemistry at the Royal Garden of Plants, member of the Academy of Sciences.[7] He first made his mark in the field of mathematics and, in his Sur le jeu de franc-carreau (On the game of fair-square), introduced differential and integral calculus into probability theory; the problem of Buffon's needle in probability theory is named after him. In 1734 he was admitted to the French Academy of Sciences. During this period he corresponded with the Swiss mathematician Gabriel Cramer./nHis protector Maurepas had asked the Academy of Sciences to do research on wood for the construction of ships in 1733. Soon afterward, Buffon began a long-term study, performing some of the most comprehensive tests to date on the mechanical properties of wood. Included were a series of tests to compare the properties of small specimens with those of large members. After carefully testing more than a thousand small specimens without knots or other defects, Buffon concluded that it was not possible to extrapolate to the properties of full-size timbers, and he began a series of tests on full-size structural members./nIn 1739 he was appointed head of the Parisian Jardin du Roi with the help of Maurepas; he held this position to the end of his life. Buffon was instrumental in transforming the Jardin du Roi into a major research center and museum. He also enlarged it, arranging the purchase of adjoining plots of land and acquiring new botanical and zoological specimens from all over the world./nThanks to his talent as a writer, he was invited to join Paris's second great academy, the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise in 1753 and then in 1768 he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.[8] In his Discours sur le style (\"Discourse on Style\"), pronounced before the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, he said, \"Writing well consists of thinking, feeling and expressing well, of clarity of mind, soul and taste\u00a0... The style is the man himself\" (\"Le style c'est l'homme m\u00eame\").[9] Unfortunately for him, Buffon's reputation as a literary stylist also gave ammunition to his detractors: the mathematician Jean le Rond d'Alembert, for example, called him \"the great phrase-monger\"./nIn 1752 Buffon married Marie-Fran\u00e7oise de Saint-Belin-Malain, the daughter of an impoverished noble family from Burgundy, who had been enrolled in the convent school run by his sister. Madame de Buffon's second child, a son born in 1764, survived childhood; she herself died in 1769. When in 1772 Buffon became seriously ill and the promise that his son (then only 8) should succeed him as director of the Jardin became clearly impracticable and was withdrawn, the King raised Buffon's estates in Burgundy to the status of a county \u2013 and thus Buffon (and his son) became a count. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1782.[10] Buffon died in Paris in 1788./nHe was buried in a chapel adjacent to the church of Sainte-Urse Montbard; during the French Revolution, his tomb was broken into and the lead that covered the coffin was ransacked to produce bullets. His heart was initially saved, as it was guarded by Suzanne Necker (wife of Jacques Necker), but was later lost. Today, only Buffon's cerebellum remains, as it is kept in the base of the statue by Pajou that Louis XVI had commissioned in his honor in 1776, located at the Museum of Natural History in Paris./nBuffon's Histoire naturelle, g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et particuli\u00e8re (1749\u20131788: in 36 volumes; an additional volume based on his notes appeared in 1789) was originally intended to cover all three \"kingdoms\" of nature but the Histoire naturelle ended up being limited to the animal and mineral kingdoms, and the animals covered were only the birds and quadrupeds. \"Written in a brilliant style, this work was read ... by every educated person in Europe\".[2] Those who assisted him in the production of this great work included Louis Jean-Marie Daubenton, Philibert Gu\u00e9neau de Montbeillard, and Gabriel-L\u00e9opold Bexon, along with numerous artists. Buffon's Histoire naturelle was translated into many different languages, making him one of the most widely read authors of the day, a rival to Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Voltaire.[11]/nIn the opening volumes of the Histoire naturelle Buffon questioned the usefulness of mathematics, criticized Carl Linnaeus's taxonomical approach to natural history, outlined a history of the Earth with little relation to the Biblical account, and proposed a theory of reproduction that ran counter to the prevailing theory of pre-existence. The early volumes were condemned by the Faculty of Theology at the Sorbonne. Buffon published a retraction, but he continued publishing the offending volumes without any change./nIn the course of his examination of the animal world, Buffon noted that despite similar environments, different regions have distinct plants and animals, a concept later known as Buffon's Law. This is considered to be the first principle of biogeography. He made the suggestion that species may have both \"improved\" and \"degenerated\" after dispersing from a center of creation. In volume 14 he argued that all the world's quadrupeds had developed from an original set of just thirty-eight quadrupeds.[12] On this basis, he is sometimes considered a \"transformist\" and a precursor of Darwin. He also asserted that climate change may have facilitated the worldwide spread of species from their centers of origin. Still, interpreting his ideas on the subject is not simple, for he returned to topics many times in the course of his work./nBuffon considered the similarities between humans and apes, but ultimately rejected the possibility of a common descent. He debated with James Burnett, Lord Monboddo on the relationship of the primates to man, Monboddo insisting, against Buffon, on a close relationship.[13]/nAt one point, Buffon propounded a theory that nature in the New World was inferior to that of Eurasia. He argued that the Americas were lacking in large and powerful creatures, and that even the people were less virile than their European counterparts. He ascribed this inferiority to the marsh odors and dense forests of the American continent. These remarks so incensed Thomas Jefferson that he dispatched twenty soldiers to the New Hampshire woods to find a bull moose for Buffon as proof of the \"stature and majesty of American quadrupeds\".[14]/nIn Les \u00e9poques de la nature (1778) Buffon discussed the origins of the Solar System, speculating that the planets had been created by a comet's collision with the Sun.[15] He also suggested that the Earth originated much earlier than 4004 BC, the date determined by Archbishop James Ussher. Basing his figures on the cooling rate of iron tested at his Laboratory the Petit Fontenet at Montbard, he calculated that the age of the Earth was 75,000 years. Once again, his ideas were condemned by the Sorbonne, and once again he issued a retraction to avoid further problems.[16]/nBuffon knew of the existence of extinct species as mammoths or european rhinos. And some of his assumptions have inspired current models, such as continental drift./nBuffon and Johann Blumenbach were believers in monogenism, the concept that all races have a single origin. They also believed in the \"degeneration theory\" of racial origins. They both said that Adam and Eve were Caucasian and that other races came about by degeneration from environmental factors, such as the sun and poor diet. They believed that the degeneration could be reversed if proper environmental control was taken, and that all contemporary forms of man could revert to the original Caucasian race.[17]/nBuffon and Blumenbach claimed that pigmentation arose because of the heat of the tropical sun. They suggested cold wind caused the tawny colour of the Eskimos. They thought the Chinese relatively fair-skinned compared to the other Asian stocks because they kept mostly in towns and were protected from environmental factors. Buffon said that food and the mode of living could make races degenerate and distinguish them from the original Caucasian race.[17]/nBelieving in monogenism, Buffon thought that skin color could change in a single lifetime, depending on the conditions of climate and diet.[18]/nBuffon was an advocate of the Asia hypothesis; in his Histoire Naturelle, he argued that humans' birthplace must be in a high temperate zone. As he believed good climate conditions would breed healthy humans, he hypothesized that the most logical place to look for the first humans' existence would be in Asia and around the Caspian Sea region.[19]/nCharles Darwin wrote in his preliminary historical sketch added to the third edition of On the Origin of Species: \"Passing over ... Buffon, with whose writings I am not familiar\". Then, from the fourth edition onwards, he amended this to say that \"the first author who in modern times has treated it [evolution] in a scientific spirit was Buffon. But as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods, and as he does not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species, I need not here enter on details\".[20] Buffon's work on degeneration, however, was immensely influential on later scholars but was overshadowed by strong moral overtones.[21]/nThe paradox of Buffon is that, according to Ernst Mayr:/nHe was not an evolutionary biologist, yet he was the father of evolutionism. He was the first person to discuss a large number of evolutionary problems, problems that before Buffon had not been raised by anybody ... he brought them to the attention of the scientific world./nExcept for Aristotle and Darwin, no other student of organisms [whole animals and plants] has had as far-reaching an influence./nHe brought the idea of evolution into the realm of science. He developed a concept of the \"unity of type\", a precursor of comparative anatomy. More than anyone else, he was responsible for the acceptance of a long-time scale for the history of the earth. He was one of the first to imply that you get inheritance from your parents, in a description based on similarities between elephants and mammoths. And yet, he hindered evolution by his frequent endorsement of the immutability of species. He provided a criterion of species, fertility among members of a species, that was thought impregnable.[2]/nBuffon wrote about the concept of struggle for existence.[22] He developed a system of heredity which was similar to Darwin's hypothesis of pangenesis.[23] Commenting on Buffon's views, Darwin stated, \"If Buffon had assumed that his organic molecules had been formed by each separate unit throughout the body, his view and mine would have been very closely similar.\"[24]/nBuffon, \u0152uvres, ed.

She completed a postdoc at Technion Israel Institute of Technology and held positions at Lehigh University and Washington University in St. Louis./nGordon is most well known for her work in isospectral geometry, for which hearing the shape of a drum is the prototypical example.  In 1966 Mark Kac asked whether the shape of a drum could be determined by the sound it makes (whether a Riemannian manifold is determined by the spectrum of its Laplace\u2013Beltrami operator). John Milnor observed that a theorem due to Witt implied the existence of a pair of 16-dimensional tori that have the same spectrum but different shapes. However, the problem in two dimensions remained open until 1992, when Gordon, with coauthors Webb and Wolpert, constructed a pair of regions in the Euclidean plane that have different shapes but identical eigenvalues  (see figure on right).  In further work, Gordon and Webb produced convex isospectral domains in the hyperbolic plane[2] and in Euclidean space.[3]/nGordon has written or coauthored over 30 articles on isospectral geometry including work on isospectral closed Riemannian manifolds with a common Riemannian covering.  These isospectral Riemannian manifolds have the same local geometry but different topology.  They can be found using the \"Sunada method,\" due to Toshikazu Sunada.  In 1993 she found isospectral Riemannian manifolds which are not locally isometric and, since that time, has worked with coauthors to produce a number of other such examples.[4]/nGordon has also worked on projects concerning the homology class, length spectrum (the collection of lengths of all closed geodesics, together with multiplicities) and geodesic flow on isospectral Riemannian manifolds.[3][5]/nIn 2001 Gordon and Webb were awarded the Mathematical Association of America Chauvenet Prize for their 1996 American Scientist paper, \"You can't hear the shape of a drum\".

He became the Director of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, and the first President of the Prussian Academy of Science, at the invitation of Frederick the Great./nMaupertuis made an expedition to Lapland to determine the shape of the Earth. He is often credited with having invented the principle of least action; a version is known as Maupertuis's principle \u2013 an integral equation that determines the path followed by a physical system. His work in natural history is interesting in relation to modern science, since he touched on aspects of heredity and the struggle for life./nMaupertuis was born at Saint-Malo, France, to a moderately wealthy family of merchant-corsairs. His father, Ren\u0117, had been involved in a number of enterprises that were central to the monarchy so that he thrived socially and politically.[2] The son was educated in mathematics by a private tutor, Nicolas Guisn\u00e9e,[3] and upon completing his formal education his father secured him a largely honorific cavalry commission. After three years in the cavalry, during which time he became acquainted with fashionable social and mathematical circles, he moved to Paris and began building his reputation as a mathematician and literary wit. In 1723 he was admitted to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences./nHis early mathematical work revolved around the vis viva controversy, for which Maupertuis developed and extended the work of Isaac Newton (whose theories were not yet widely accepted outside England) and argued against the waning Cartesian mechanics. In the 1730s, the shape of the Earth became a flashpoint in the battle among rival systems of mechanics. Maupertuis, based on his exposition of Newton (with the help of his mentor Johan Bernoulli) predicted that the Earth should be oblate, while his rival Jacques Cassini measured it astronomically to be prolate. In 1736 Maupertuis acted as chief of the French Geodesic Mission sent by King Louis XV to Lapland to measure the length of a degree of arc of the meridian. His results, which he published in a book detailing his procedures, essentially settled the controversy in his favour. The book included an adventure narrative of the expedition, and an account of the K\u00e4ym\u00e4j\u00e4rvi Inscriptions in Sweden. On his return home he became a member of almost all the scientific societies of Europe.[4]/nAfter the Lapland expedition, Maupertuis set about generalising his earlier mathematical work, proposing the principle of least action as a metaphysical principle that underlies all the laws of mechanics. He also expanded into the biological realm, anonymously publishing a book that was part popular science, part philosophy, and part erotica: V\u00e9nus physique. In that work, Maupertuis proposed a theory of generation (i.e., reproduction) in which organic matter possessed a self-organizing \u201cintelligence\u201d that was analogous to the contemporary chemical concept of affinities, which was widely read and commented upon favourably by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. He later developed his views on living things further in a more formal pseudonymous work that explored heredity, collecting evidence that confirmed the contributions of both sexes and treated variations as statistical phenomena./nIn 1740 Maupertuis went to Berlin at the invitation of Frederick II of Prussia, and took part in the Battle of Mollwitz on a donkey, where he was taken prisoner by the Austrians. On his release he returned to Berlin, and thence to Paris, where he was elected director of the Academy of Sciences in 1742, and in the following year was admitted into the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise. Returning to Berlin in 1744, again at the desire of Frederick II, he was chosen president of the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1746, which he controlled with the help of Leonhard Euler until his death. His position became extremely awkward with the outbreak of the Seven Years' War between his home country and his patron's, and his reputation suffered in both Paris and Berlin. Finding his health declining, he retired in 1757 to the south of France with a young girl, leaving his wife and children behind and went in 1758 to Basel, where he died a year later.[5] Maupertuis's difficult disposition involved him in constant quarrels, of which his controversies with Samuel K\u00f6nig and Voltaire during the latter part of his life are examples.[6]/nSome historians of science point to his work in biology as a significant precursor to the development of evolutionary theory, specifically the theory of natural selection.[8] Other writers contend that his remarks are cursory, vague, or incidental to that particular argument. Mayr's verdict was \"He was neither an evolutionist, nor one of the founders of the theory of natural selection [but] he was one of the pioneers of genetics\". Maupertuis espoused a theory of pangenesis, postulating particles from both mother and father as responsible for the characters of the child.[9] Bowler credits him with studies on heredity, with the natural origin of human races, and with the idea that forms of life may have changed with time.[10]/nMaupertuis was a strong critic of the natural theologians, pointing to phenomena incompatible with a concept of a good and wise Creator. He was also one of the first to consider animals in terms of variable populations, in opposition to the natural history tradition that emphasised description of individual specimens./nThe difficulty of interpreting Maupertuis can be gauged by reading the original works. Below is a translation from the Essai de cosmologie, followed by the original French passage:/nBut could one not say that, in the fortuitous combinations of the productions of nature, as there were but some where certain relations of fitness[11] were present which be able to subsist, it is not to be wondered at that this fitness is present in all the species that are currently in existence? Chance, it may be said, had produced an innumerable multitude of individuals; a small number found themselves constructed in such a manner that the parts of the animal were able to satisfy its needs; in another infinitely greater number, there was neither fitness nor order: all of these latter have perished. Animals lacking a mouth could not live; others lacking reproductive organs could not perpetuate themselves; the only ones that remained are those in which order and fitness were found; and these species, which we see today, are but the smallest part of what blind destiny had produced./nMais ne pourroit-on pas dire, que dans la combinaison fortuite des productions de la Nature, comme il n'y avoit que celles o\u00f9 se trouvoient certains rapports de convenance, qui pussent subsister, il n'est pas merveilleux que cette convenance se trouve dans toutes les especes qui actuellement existent? Le hasard, diroit-on, avoit produit une multitude innombrable d'Individus; un petit nombre se trouvoit construit de maniere que les parties de l'Animal pouvoient satisfaire \u00e0 ses besoins; dans un autre infiniment plus grand, il n'y avoit ni convenance, ni ordre: tous ces derniers ont p\u00e9ri; des Animaux sans bouche ne pouvoient pas vivre, d'autres qui manquoient d'organes pour la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration ne pouvoient pas se perp\u00e9tuer; les feuls qui soient rest\u00e9s, sont ceux o\u00f9 se trouvoient l'ordre & la convenance: & ces especes que nous voyons aujourd'hui, ne sont que la plus petite partie de ce qu'un destin aveugle avoit produit.[12]/nThe same text was published earlier (1748) as \"Les loix du mouvement et du repos d\u00e9duites d'un principe metaphysique\" (translation: \"Derivation of the laws of motion and equilibrium from a metaphysical principle\"). King-Hele (1963) points to similar, though not identical, ideas of thirty years later by David Hume in his Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (1777)./nThe chief debate that Maupertuis was engaged in was one that treated the competing theories of generation (i.e. preformationism and epigenesis). His account of life involved spontaneous generation of new kinds of animals and plants, together with massive elimination of deficient forms. These ideas avoid the need for a Creator, but are not part of modern thinking on evolution.[13] The date of these speculations, 1745, is concurrent with Carl Linnaeus's own work, and so predates any firm notion of species. Also, the work on genealogy, coupled with the tracing of phenotypic characters through lineages, foreshadows later work done in genetics./nThe principle of least action states that in all natural phenomena a quantity called 'action' tends to be minimised.\nMaupertuis developed such a principle over two decades. For him, action could be expressed mathematically as the product of the mass of the body involved, the distance it had travelled and the velocity at which it was travelling./nIn 1741, he gave a paper to the Paris Academy of Sciences, Loi du repos des corps, (Law of bodies at rest). In it he showed that a system of bodies at rest tends to reach a position in which any change would create the smallest possible change in a quantity that he argued could be assimilated to action./nIn 1744, in another paper to the Paris Academy, he gave his Accord de plusieurs lois naturelles qui avaient paru jusqu'ici incompatibles (Agreement of several natural laws that had hitherto seemed to be incompatible) to show that the behaviour of light during refraction \u2013 when it bends on entering a new medium \u2013 was such that the total path it followed, from a point in the first medium to a point in the second, minimised a quantity which he again assimilated to action./nFinally, in 1746 he gave a further paper, the Loix du mouvement et du repos (Laws of movement and rest), this time to the Berlin Academy of Sciences, which showed that point masses also minimise action. Point masses are bodies that can be treated for the purposes of analysis as being a certain amount of matter (a mass) concentrated at a single point. A major debate in the early part of the eighteenth century concerned the behaviour of such bodies in collisions./nCartesian and Newtonian physicists argued that in their collisions, point masses conserved both momentum and relative velocity. Leibnizians, on the other hand, argued that they also conserved what was called live force or vis viva. This was unacceptable for their opponents for two reasons: the first that live force conservation did not apply to so-called \u2018hard\u2019 bodies, bodies that were totally incompressible, whereas the other two conservation principles did; the second was that live force was defined by the product of mass and square of velocity. Why did the velocity appear twice in this quantity, as squaring it suggests? The Leibnizians argued this was simple enough: there was a natural tendency in all matter towards motion, so even at rest, there is an inherent velocity in bodies; when they begin to move, there is a second velocity term corresponding to their actual motion./nThis was anathema to Cartesians and Newtonians. An inherent tendency towards motion was an \u2018occult quality\u2019 of the kind of favoured by mediaeval scholastics and to be resisted at all costs./nToday the concept of a \u2018hard\u2019 body is rejected; and mass times the square of velocity is just twice kinetic energy so modern mechanics reserves a major role for the inheritor quantity of \u2018live force\u2019./nFor Maupertuis, however, it was important to retain the concept of the hard body. And the beauty of his principle of least action was that it applied just as well to hard and elastic bodies. Since he had shown that the principle also applied to systems of bodies at rest and to light, it seemed that it was truly universal./nThe final stage of his argument came when Maupertuis set out to interpret his principle in cosmological terms. \u2018Least action\u2019 sounds like an economy principle, roughly equivalent to the idea of economy of effort in daily life. A universal principle of economy of effort would seem to display the working of wisdom in the very construction of the universe. This seems, in Maupertuis's view, a more powerful argument for the existence of an infinitely wise creator than any other that can be advanced./nHe published his thinking on these matters in his Essai de cosmologie (Essay on cosmology) of 1750. He shows that the major arguments advanced to prove God, from the wonders of nature or the apparent regularity of the universe, are all open to objection (what wonder is there in the existence of certain particularly repulsive insects, what regularity is there in the observation that all the planets turn in nearly the same plane \u2013 exactly the same plane might have been striking but 'nearly the same plane' is far less convincing). But a universal principle of wisdom provides an undeniable proof of the shaping of the universe by a wise creator./nHence the principle of least action is not just the culmination of Maupertuis's work in several areas of physics, he sees it as his most important achievement in philosophy too, giving an incontrovertible proof of God./nThe flaws in his reasoning are principally that there is no obvious reason why the product of mass, velocity and distance should be particularly viewed as corresponding to action, and even less reason why its minimisation should be an 'economy' principle like a minimisation of effort. Indeed, the product of mass, velocity and distance is mathematically the equivalent of the product of the live force and time; thus the integral over distance of the product of mass and velocity is equivalent of the integral over time of the live force. Leibniz had already shown that this quantity is likely to be either minimised or maximised in natural phenomena. Minimising this quantity could conceivably demonstrate economy, but how could maximising it? (See also the corresponding principles of stationary actions by Lagrange and Hamilton)./nIn Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens, Immanuel Kant quotes Maupertuis' 1745 discussion of nebula-like objects, which Maupertuis notes are actually collections of stars, including Andromeda./nArthur Schopenhauer suggested that Immanuel Kant's \"most important and brilliant doctrine\"\u2014contained in the Critique of Pure Reason (1781)\u2014was asserted by Maupertuis:/nBut what are we to say when we find Kant's most important and brilliant doctrine, that of the ideality of space and of the merely phenomenal existence of the corporeal world, expressed already thirty years previously by Maupertuis?\u00a0... Maupertuis expresses this paradoxical doctrine so decidedly, and yet without the addition of proof, that it must be supposed that he also obtained it from somewhere else.[14]", "57310845": "Daphne Letitia Smith was the first African-American woman to earn a Ph.D. in mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),[1] in 1985.[2] She is the president of the National Alumnae Association of Spelman College, her alma mater, and a member of Spelman's Board of Trustees; in 2011 she was honored with the Alumnae Association's Hall of Fame Award, \"the organization\u2019s highest honor\".[3]/nSmith is originally from Ocala, Florida,[1] and graduated from Spelman College in 1980.[3]\nAt MIT, she studied probability theory as a student of Richard M.

De Parthenay was married twice, first to the Protestant baron Charles de Quelennec.[4] During the four years of their marriage, Quelennec was often away and was reported to have dishonored his wife. After she reached out for support from Jeanne d'Albret, Queen of Navarre, he kidnapped and imprisoned her in a castle in Brittany.

Written for her friend Catherine de Bourbon, one of the works was Madame au Chateau de Pau le 23 aoust 1592 (Madame at the Chateau de Pau on August 23, 1592). She also wrote Au Balet de Madame (At Madame's Ballet), and Autre Balet (Other Ballet). De Parthenay wrote the first two with messages for Henry IV because she was discouraged that the king converted to Catholicism, favored his former Catholic enemies,[8] and prohibited his sister Catherine from marrying Charles de Bourbon, Count of Soissons. One of the plays concluded by the intervention of Mercury, representing Jupiter, and the triumph of Love over the nymphs.[42] The third other ballet, M\u00e9d\u00e9e, was about the magician Medea and Sibyl.[43]/nDe Parthenay also wrote the satire Apologie pour le roi Henri IV envers ceux qui le blasment de ce qu \u2019il gratifie plus ses ennemis que ses serviteurs (Apology for King Henry IV towards those who blaspheme him for gratifying his enemies more than his servants) in 1596.[8] The pamphlet, which also lamented the treatment of Catherine de Bourbon, was published anonymously.[44][45]/nHenri IV was assassinated in 1610, after which de Parthenay wrote a famous eulogy to the king, Stances sur la mort du Roy.[46] Marie de' Medici, the king's widow, became the Queen Regent of France, which strengthened the power of the monarchy as well as Cardinal Richelieu, thereby weakening the Protestant's position. Her sons were angry about the changes, and Parthenay sought to appease them. They later reconciled with Marie de' Medici. Parthenay communicated with Philippe du Plessis Mornay in secret correspondence to strategise for the Huguenot cause.[47][48] Their correspondence ceased due to illness and after Duplessis-Mornay's rejection by his sons.[49] She also corresponded with Countess Charlotte Brabantina of Nassau about political challenges.[50]/nBeginning in 1626, de Parthenay and her daughter Anne lived at the Hotel de Marsan in La Rochelle, a Huguenot stronghold, safe from the court's orders to have her arrested.[51][52] Her son arrived later with an English fleet that came to La Rochelle to negotiate peace with France on behalf of England. The mayor refused to allow the negotiator or Benjamin to enter the city.[52] De Parthenay found her son at Porte Saint-Nicholas and took his hand as she said so the mayor and others could hear the conversation,/nCome, my son, follow me without fear, with all those who are with you; all good people rejoice at your coming, and will rejoice even more when they consider how affectionate you have been for the freedom of the city which they hope to recover by the arms of the King of England, which you have had. The house of Rohan will always want the good of La Rochelle, and will procure it as much as possible.[52]/nThe mother and son freely entered the La Rochelle without opposition from the mayor and to the cheers of the residents. Although they had hoped against it, the city's residents realised at that time there would be a fight between the Huguenot residents and the French royal army.[52] Cardinal Richelieu's armies positioned themselves around La Rochelle in August 1627,[4] leading up to the Siege of the city (beginning 10 September 1627).[52]/nThe Siege lasted 16 months, during which 75% of the defenders died of starvation. Anne and her mother survived on a daily ration of four ounces of bread and horsemeat towards the end of the war.

He was a prominent Newtonian whose work helped to establish the validity of the principles and results that Sir Isaac Newton had outlined in the Principia of 1687. Clairaut was one of the key figures in the expedition to Lapland that helped to confirm Newton's theory for the figure of the Earth. In that context, Clairaut worked out a mathematical result now known as \"Clairaut's theorem\". He also tackled the gravitational three-body problem, being the first to obtain a satisfactory result for the apsidal precession of the Moon's orbit. In mathematics he is also credited with Clairaut's equation and Clairaut's relation./nClairaut was born in Paris, France, to Jean-Baptiste and Catherine Petit Clairaut. The couple had 20 children, however only a few of them survived childbirth.[2] His father taught mathematics. Alexis was a prodigy \u2013 at the age of ten he began studying calculus. At the age of twelve he wrote a memoir on four geometrical curves and under his father's tutelage he made such rapid progress in the subject that in his thirteenth year he read before the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise an account of the properties of four curves which he had discovered.[3] When only sixteen he finished a treatise on Tortuous Curves, Recherches sur les courbes a double courbure, which, on its publication in 1731, procured his admission into the Royal Academy of Sciences, although he was below the legal age as he was only eighteen. He gave a path breaking formulae called the distance formulae which helps to find out the distance between any 2 points on the cartesian or XY plane./nClairaut was unmarried, and known for leading an active social life.[2] His growing popularity in society hindered his scientific work: \"He was focused,\" says Bossut, \"with dining and with evenings, coupled with a lively taste for women, and seeking to make his pleasures into his day to day work, he lost rest, health, and finally life at the age of fifty-two.\" Though he led a fulfilling social life, he was very prominent in the advancement of learning in young mathematicians./nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London on 27 October 1737.[4]/nClairaut died in Paris in 1765./nIn 1736, together with Pierre Louis Maupertuis, he took part in the expedition to Lapland, which was undertaken for the purpose of estimating a degree of the meridian arc.[5] The goal of the excursion was to geometrically calculate the shape of the Earth, which Sir Isaac Newton theorised in his book Principia was an ellipsoid shape. They sought to prove if Newton's theory and calculations were correct or not. Before the expedition team returned to Paris, Clairaut sent his calculations to the Royal Society of London. The writing was later published by the society in the 1736\u201337 volume of Philosophical Transactions.[6] Initially, Clairaut disagrees with Newton's theory on the shape of the Earth. In the article, he outlines several key problems that effectively disprove Newton's calculations, and provides some solutions to the complications. The issues addressed include calculating gravitational attraction, the rotation of an ellipsoid on its axis, and the difference in density of an ellipsoid on its axes.[6] At the end of his letter, Clairaut writes that:/n\"It appears even Sir Isaac Newton was of the opinion, that it was necessary the Earth should be more dense toward the center, in order to be so much the flatter at the poles: and that it followed from this greater flatness, that gravity increased so much the more from the equator towards the Pole.\"[6]/nThis conclusion suggests not only that the Earth is of an oblate ellipsoid shape, but it is flattened more at the poles and is wider at the centre.\nHis article in Philosophical Transactions created much controversy, as he addressed the problems of Newton's theory, but provided few solutions to how to fix the calculations. After his return, he published his treatise Th\u00e9orie de la figure de la terre (1743). In this work he promulgated the theorem, known as Clairaut's theorem, which connects the gravity at points on the surface of a rotating ellipsoid with the compression and the centrifugal force at the equator. This hydrostatic model of the shape of the Earth was founded on a paper by the Scottish mathematician Colin Maclaurin, which had shown that a mass of homogeneous fluid set in rotation about a line through its centre of mass would, under the mutual attraction of its particles, take the form of an ellipsoid. Under the assumption that the Earth was composed of concentric ellipsoidal shells of uniform density, Clairaut's theorem could be applied to it, and allowed the ellipticity of the Earth to be calculated from surface measurements of gravity. This proved Sir Isaac Newton's theory that the shape of the Earth was an oblate ellipsoid.[2] In 1849 George Stokes showed that Clairaut's result was true whatever the interior constitution or density of the Earth, provided the surface was a spheroid of equilibrium of small ellipticity./nIn 1741, Clairaut wrote a book called \u00c9l\u00e9ments de G\u00e9om\u00e9trie. The book outlines the basic concepts of geometry. Geometry in the 1700s was complex to the average learner. It was considered to be a dry subject. Clairaut saw this trend, and wrote the book in an attempt to make the subject more interesting for the average learner. He believed that instead of having students repeatedly work problems that they did not fully understand, it was imperative for them to make discoveries themselves in a form of active, experiential learning.[7] He begins the book by comparing geometric shapes to measurements of land, as it was a subject that most anyone could relate to. He covers topics from lines, shapes, and even some three dimensional objects. Throughout the book, he continuously relates different concepts such as physics, astrology, and other branches of mathematics to geometry. Some of the theories and learning methods outlined in the book are still used by teachers today, in geometry and other topics.[8]/nOne of the most controversial issues of the 18th century was the problem of three bodies, or how the Earth, Moon, and Sun are attracted to one another. With the use of the recently founded Leibnizian calculus, Clairaut was able to solve the problem using four differential equations.[9] He was also able to incorporate Newton's inverse-square law and law of attraction into his solution, with minor edits to it. However, these equations only offered approximate measurement, and no exact calculations. Another issue still remained with the three body problem; how the Moon rotates on its apsides. Even Newton could account for only half of the motion of the apsides.[9] This issue had puzzled astronomers. In fact, Clairaut had at first deemed the dilemma so inexplicable, that he was on the point of publishing a new hypothesis as to the law of attraction./nThe question of the apsides was a heated debate topic in Europe. Along with Clairaut, there were two other mathematicians who were racing to provide the first explanation for the three body problem; Leonhard Euler and Jean le Rond d'Alembert.[9] Euler and d'Alembert were arguing against the use of Newtonian laws to solve the three body problem. Euler in particular believed that the inverse square law needed revision to accurately calculate the apsides of the Moon./nDespite the hectic competition to come up with the correct solution, Clairaut obtained an ingenious approximate solution of the problem of the three bodies. In 1750 he gained the prize of the St Petersburg Academy for his essay Th\u00e9orie de la lune; the team made up of Clairaut, J\u00e9rome Lalande and Nicole Reine Lepaute successfully computed the date of the 1759 return of Halley's comet.[10] The Th\u00e9orie de la lune is strictly Newtonian in character. This contains the explanation of the motion of the apsis. It occurred to him to carry the approximation to the third order, and he thereupon found that the result was in accordance with the observations. This was followed in 1754 by some lunar tables, which he computed using a form of the discrete Fourier transform.[11]/nThe newfound solution to the problem of three bodies ended up meaning more than proving Newton's laws correct. The unravelling of the problem of three bodies also had practical importance. It allowed sailors to determine the longitudinal direction of their ships, which was crucial not only in sailing to a location, but finding their way home as well.[9] This held economic implications as well, because sailors were able to more easily find destinations of trade based on the longitudinal measures./nClairaut subsequently wrote various papers on the orbit of the Moon, and on the motion of comets as affected by the perturbation of the planets, particularly on the path of Halley's comet. He also used applied mathematics to study Venus, taking accurate measurements of the planet's size and distance from the Earth. This was the first precise reckoning of the planet's size.", "1572530": "John Montroll is an American origami artist, author, teacher, and mathematician.

His fundamental contributions to the theory of the Yamabe equation led, in  conjunction with\nresults of Trudinger  and Schoen, to a proof of the Yamabe Conjecture: every compact Riemannian manifold\ncan be conformally rescaled to produce a manifold of constant scalar curvature.  Along with Yau, he also showed\nthat K\u00e4hler manifolds with negative first Chern classes always admit K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metrics, a result closely related to the Calabi conjecture. The latter result, established by Yau, provides the largest class of known examples of compact Einstein manifolds. Aubin was the first mathematician to propose the Cartan\u2013Hadamard conjecture./nAubin was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1979.[1] He was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences in 2003./nIn 1970, Aubin established that any closed smooth manifold of dimension larger than two has a Riemannian metric of negative scalar curvature. Furthermore, he proved that a Riemannian metric of nonnegative Ricci curvature can be deformed to positive Ricci curvature, provided that its Ricci curvature is strictly positive at one point./nIn the same year, Aubin introduced an approach to the Calabi conjecture, in the field of K\u00e4hler geometry, via the calculus of variations. Later, in 1976, Aubin established the existence of K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metrics on K\u00e4hler manifolds whose first Chern class is negative.[2] Independently, Shing-Tung Yau proved the more powerful Calabi conjecture, which concerns the general problem of prescribing the Ricci curvature of a K\u00e4hler metric, via non-variational methods. As such, the existence of K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metrics with negative first Chern class is often called the Aubin\u2013Yau theorem. After learning Yau's techniques from Jerry Kazdan, Aubin found some simplifications and modifications of his work, along with Kazdan and Jean-Pierre Bourguignon.[3]/nAubin made a number of fundamental contributions to the study of Sobolev spaces on Riemannian manifolds. He established Riemannian formulations of many classical results for Sobolev spaces, such as the equivalence of various definitions, the density of various subclasses of functions, and the standard embedding theorems.[4] In one of Aubin's best-known works, the analysis of the optimal constant in the Sobolev embedding theorem was carried out. Along with similar results for the Moser\u2013Trudinger inequality, Aubin later proved improvements of the optimal constants when the functions are assumed to satisfy certain orthogonality constraints.[5]/nSuch results are naturally applicable to many problems in the field of geometric analysis. Aubin considered the Yamabe problem on conformal deformation to constant scalar curvature, which Yamabe had reduced to a problem in the calculus of variations. Following prior work of Neil Trudinger, Aubin was able to resolve the problem in high dimensions under the condition that the Weyl curvature is nonzero at some point. The key of Aubin's analysis is essentially local, with an estimate on the geometry of the Green's function based on the Weyl curvature. The more subtle case of locally conformally flat manifolds, along with the low-dimensional case, was later established by Richard Schoen as an application of Schoen and Yau's positive mass theorem./nAll of the results outlined here, along with many others, were absorbed into Aubin's book Some Nonlinear Problems in Riemannian Geometry, which has become a basic part of the research literature.[6]/nArticles.

Through his lectures, seminars, and as the author of several textbooks (such as Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics) and popular mathematics books, he influenced many mathematicians and physicists.[5][6] Many of his books were translated into English. His views on education were particularly opposed to those of Bourbaki./nVladimir Igorevich Arnold was born on 12 June 1937 in Odesa, Soviet Union (now Odesa, Ukraine). His father was Igor Vladimirovich Arnold (1900\u20131948), a mathematician. His mother was Nina Alexandrovna Arnold (1909\u20131986, n\u00e9e Isakovich), a Jewish art historian.[4] While a school student, Arnold once asked his father on the reason why the multiplication of two negative numbers yielded a positive number, and his father provided an answer involving the field properties of real numbers and the preservation of the distributive property. Arnold was deeply disappointed with this answer, and developed an aversion to the axiomatic method that lasted through his life.[7] When Arnold was thirteen, his uncle Nikolai B. Zhitkov,[8] who was an engineer, told him about calculus and how it could be used to understand some physical phenomena, this contributed to sparking his interest for mathematics, and he started to study by himself the mathematical books his father had left to him, which included some works of Leonhard Euler and Charles Hermite.[9]/nWhile a student of Andrey Kolmogorov at Moscow State University and still a teenager, Arnold showed in 1957 that any continuous function of several variables can be constructed with a finite number of two-variable functions, thereby solving Hilbert's thirteenth problem.[10] This is the Kolmogorov\u2013Arnold representation theorem./nAfter graduating from Moscow State University in 1959, he worked there until 1986 (a professor since 1965), and then at Steklov Mathematical Institute./nHe became an academician of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union (Russian Academy of Science since 1991) in 1990.[11] Arnold can be said to have initiated the theory of symplectic topology as a distinct discipline. The Arnold conjecture on the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms and Lagrangian intersections was also a motivation in the development of Floer homology./nIn 1999 he suffered a serious bicycle accident in Paris, resulting in traumatic brain injury. He regained consciousness after a few weeks but had amnesia and for some time could not even recognize his own wife at the hospital,[12] He went on to make a good recovery.[13]/nArnold worked at the Steklov Mathematical Institute in Moscow and at Paris Dauphine University up until his death. As of 2006[update] he was reported to have the highest citation index among Russian scientists,[14] and h-index of 40. His students include Alexander Givental, Victor Goryunov, Sabir Gusein-Zade, Emil Horozov, Boris Khesin, Askold Khovanskii, Nikolay Nekhoroshev, Boris Shapiro, Alexander Varchenko, Victor Vassiliev and Vladimir Zakalyukin.[2]/nTo his students and colleagues Arnold was known also for his sense of humour. For example, once at his seminar in Moscow, at the beginning of the school year, when he usually was formulating new problems, he said:/nThere is a general principle that a stupid man can ask such questions to which one hundred wise men would not be able to answer. In accordance with this principle I shall formulate some problems.[15]/nArnold died of acute pancreatitis[16] on 3 June 2010 in Paris, nine days before his 73rd birthday.[17] He was buried on 15 June in Moscow, at the Novodevichy Monastery.[18]/nIn a telegram to Arnold's family, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev stated:/nThe death of Vladimir Arnold, one of the greatest mathematicians of our time, is an irretrievable loss for world science. It is difficult to overestimate the contribution made by academician Arnold to modern mathematics and the prestige of Russian science./nTeaching had a special place in Vladimir Arnold's life and he had great influence as an enlightened mentor who taught several generations of talented scientists./nThe memory of Vladimir Arnold will forever remain in the hearts of his colleagues, friends and students, as well as everyone who knew and admired this brilliant man.[19]/nArnold is well known for his lucid writing style, combining mathematical rigour with physical intuition, and an easy conversational style of teaching and education. His writings present a fresh, often geometric approach to traditional mathematical topics like ordinary differential equations, and his many textbooks have proved influential in the development of new areas of mathematics. The standard criticism about Arnold's pedagogy is that his books \"are beautiful treatments of their subjects that are appreciated by experts, but too many details are omitted for students to learn the mathematics required to prove the statements that he so effortlessly justifies.\" His defense was that his books are meant to teach the subject to \"those who truly wish to understand it\" (Chicone, 2007).[20]/nArnold was an outspoken critic of the trend towards high levels of abstraction in mathematics during the middle of the last century. He had very strong opinions on how this approach\u2014which was most popularly implemented by the Bourbaki school in France\u2014initially had a negative impact on French mathematical education, and then later on that of other countries as well.[21][22] Arnold was very interested in the history of mathematics.[23] In an interview,[22] he said he had learned much of what he knew about mathematics through the study of Felix Klein's book Development of Mathematics in the 19th Century \u2014a book he often recommended to his students.[24] He studied the classics, most notably the works of Huygens, Newton and Poincar\u00e9,[25] and many times he reported to have found in their works ideas that had not been explored yet.[26]/nArnold worked on dynamical systems theory, catastrophe theory, topology, algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, differential equations, classical mechanics, hydrodynamics and singularity theory.[5] Mich\u00e8le Audin described him as \"a geometer in the widest possible sense of the word\" and said that \"he was very fast to make connections between different fields\".[27]/nThe problem is the following question: can every continuous function of three variables be expressed as a composition of finitely many continuous functions of two variables?  The affirmative answer to this general question was given in 1957 by Vladimir Arnold, then only nineteen years old and a student of Andrey Kolmogorov. Kolmogorov had shown in the previous year that any function of several variables can be constructed with a finite number of three-variable functions. Arnold then expanded on this work to show that only two-variable functions were in fact required, thus answering the Hilbert's question when posed for the class of continuous functions.[28]/nMoser and Arnold expanded the ideas of Kolmogorov (who was inspired by questions of Poincar\u00e9) and gave rise to what is now known as Kolmogorov\u2013Arnold\u2013Moser theorem (or \"KAM theory\"), which concerns the persistence of some quasi-periodic motions (nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems) when they are perturbed. KAM theory shows that, despite the perturbations, such systems can be stable over an infinite period of time, and specifies what the conditions for this are.[29]/nIn 1964, Arnold introduced the Arnold web, the first example of a stochastic web.[30][31]/nIn 1965, Arnold attended Ren\u00e9 Thom's seminar on catastrophe theory. He later said of it: \"I am deeply indebted to Thom, whose singularity seminar at the Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques, which I frequented throughout the year 1965, profoundly changed my mathematical universe.\"[32] After this event, singularity theory became one of the major interests of Arnold and his students.[33] Among his most famous results in this area is his classification of simple singularities, contained in his paper \"Normal forms of functions near degenerate critical points, the Weyl groups of Ak,Dk,Ek and Lagrangian singularities\".[34][35][36]/nIn 1966, Arnold published \"Sur la g\u00e9om\u00e9trie diff\u00e9rentielle des groupes de Lie de dimension infinie et ses applications \u00e0 l'hydrodynamique des fluides parfaits\", in which he presented a common geometric interpretation for both the Euler's equations for rotating rigid bodies and the Euler's equations of fluid dynamics, this effectively linked topics previously thought to be unrelated, and enabled mathematical solutions to many questions related to fluid flows and their turbulence.[37][38][39]/nIn the year 1971, Arnold published \"On the arrangement of ovals of real plane algebraic curves, involutions of four-dimensional smooth manifolds, and the arithmetic of integral quadratic forms\",[40] which gave new life to real algebraic geometry. In it, he made major advances in the direction of a solution to Gudkov's conjecture, by finding a connection between it and four-dimensional topology.[41] The conjecture was to be later fully solved by V. A. Rokhlin building on Arnold's work.[42][43]/nThe Arnold conjecture, linking the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms and the topology of the subjacent manifolds, was the motivating source of many of the pioneer studies in symplectic topology.[44][45]/nAccording to Victor Vassiliev, Arnold \"worked comparatively little on topology for topology's sake.\" And he was rather motivated by problems on other areas of mathematics where topology could be of use. His contributions include the invention of a topological form of the Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem and the initial development of some of the consequent ideas, a work which resulted in the creation of the field of topological Galois theory in the 1960s.[46][47]/nAccording to Marcel Berger, Arnold revolutionized plane curves theory.[48] Among his contributions are the Arnold invariants of plane curves.[49]/nArnold conjectured the existence of the g\u00f6mb\u00f6c.[50]/nThe minor planet 10031 Vladarnolda was named after him in 1981 by Lyudmila Georgievna Karachkina.[60]/nThe Arnold Mathematical Journal, published for the first time in 2015, is named after him.[61]/nThe Arnold Fellowships, of the London Institute are named after him.[62][63]/nHe was a plenary speaker at both the 1974 and 1983 International Congress of Mathematicians in Vancouver and Warsaw, respectively.[64]/nEven though Arnold was nominated for the 1974 Fields Medal, which was then viewed as the highest honour a mathematician could receive, interference from the Soviet government led to it being withdrawn. Arnold's public opposition to the persecution of dissidents had led him into direct conflict with influential Soviet officials, and he suffered persecution himself, including not being allowed to leave the Soviet Union during most of the 1970s and 1980s.[65][66]", "27328243": "David Tong is a British theoretical physicist.

Waugh and her grandfather was horticulturist Frank Albert Waugh.[3]/nShe was active in the mathematics club at Oberlin College in the mid-1940s,[4] and graduated from Oberlin in 1947.[5][2]\nAfter earning a master's degree in 1948 from the University of Wisconsin,[2] she completed her Ph.D. in 1951 at the University of Oregon. Her dissertation, Fermat's Theorem for Matrices over a Modular Ring, was supervised by Ivan M. Niven.[6] In 1948 she had married John Edward Maxfield, another student at Wisconsin and the University of Oregon who became her frequent collaborator.[7]/nAs students, both Maxfields visited the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, then known as the Naval Ordnance Test Station, in the summers. After completing their doctorates they worked at the station from 1951 until 1960,[8] when John Maxfield took a succession of academic posts at the University of Florida, Kansas State University, and (beginning in 1981) at Louisiana Tech University.[7] Margaret, also, became a professor of business at Kansas State,[9] and a professor of mathematics and statistics at Louisiana Tech.[10]/nBy 2011 Maxfield had retired, but was still active in mathematics, and noted to her alumni magazine that she was using Wikipedia to find bibliographic material for her papers.[5] She died on December 20, 2016, in Placerville, California.[1][2]/nWhile at the Naval Ordnance Test Station, Maxfield coauthored the book Statistics Manual: With Examples Taken from Ordnance Development, with Edwin L. Crow and Frances A. Davis. It was published by the station in 1955, and reprinted by Dover Books in 1960.[11]/nWith John Maxfield, she was also the coauthor of Contemporary Mathematics for General Education: Algebra (Allyn and Bacon, 1963, also with S. Gould Sadler)[7] Abstract Algebra and Solution By Radicals (W. B. Saunders, 1971; reprinted by Dover Books, 1992),[12] Discovering Number Theory (W. B. Saunders, 1972),[13] and Keys to Mathematics (W. B. Saunders, 1973)[14]/nMaxfield was one of the 1968 winners of the Lester R. Ford Award of the Mathematical Association of America for a paper with her father on the rational approximation of square roots.[15]", "5701425": "James Dodson FRS (c.1705\u20131757) was a British mathematician, actuary and innovator in the insurance industry./nMatthew Maty, in his M\u00e9moire sur la vie et sur les \u00e9crits de M. A. de Moivre, wrote that Dodson was a pupil of Abraham de Moivre. He worked as an accountant and teacher. In 1752 George Parker, 2nd Earl of Macclesfield, a friend of Dodson, became President of the Royal Society, and Dodson was elected a Fellow on 16 January 1755. On 7 August of the same year he was elected master of the Royal Mathematical School, Christ's Hospital, and also of Stone's School there. Dodson died 23 November 1757, being then over fifty-two years of age. He lived at Bell Dock, Wapping./nHaving been refused admission to the Amicable Life Assurance Society, because they took no one over 45, he decided to form a new society on a plan of assurance that would be more \"equitable\". Dodson built on the statistical mortality tables developed by Edmund Halley in 1693. Equitable Life, as it was to be, charged premiums aimed at correctly offsetting the risks of long term life assurance policies. But Dodson made only unsuccessful attempts to procure a charter. The Equitable Life Assurance Society was founded in 1762 to put the actuarial principles that Dodson had developed over the previous decade into practice, by a group of mathematicians and others including Edward Rowe Mores./nAs a mathematician Dodson is known mainly for his work on The Anti-Logarithmic Canon and The Mathematical Miscellany./nIn 1742 Dodson published The Anti-Logarithmic Canon. Being a table of numbers consisting of eleven places of figures, corresponding to all Logarithms under 100,000, with an Introduction containing a short account of Logarithms. This was a unique tabulation until 1849. The canon had been actually calculated, it is said, by Walter Warner and John Pell, in the period 1630 to 1640. Its provenance was that Warner had left it to Herbert Thorndike, at whose death it came to Richard Busby, and finally was bought for the Royal Society; but for some years it had been lost. In a letter of Pell's, 7 August 1644, written to Sir Charles Cavendish, it is said that Warner became bankrupt, and Pell surmises that the manuscript would be destroyed by the creditors in ignorance./nIn 1747 Dodson published The Calculator \u2026 adapted to Science, Business, and Pleasure. It is a large collection of small tables, with some seven-figure logarithms. This he dedicated to William Jones. The same year he started the publication of The Mathematical Miscellany, containing analytical and algebraic solutions of a large number of problems in various branches of mathematics. His preface to vol. i is dated 14 January 1747, the title giving 1748. This volume is dedicated to Abraham de Moivre, and a second edition was issued by his publisher in 1775. Vol. ii (1753) is dedicated to David Papillon, and contains a contribution by de Moivre. Vol. iii (1755) he dedicated to Macclesfield and the Royal Society. This volume is devoted to problems relating to annuities, reversions, insurances, leases on lives, etc.. His Accountant, or a Method of Book-keeping, was published 1750, with a dedication to Macclesfield. In 1751 he edited Edmund Wingate's Arithmetic, which had previously been edited by John Kersey and then by George Shelley./nAnother work, An Account of the Methods used to describe Lines on Dr. Halley's Chart of the terraqueous Globe, showing the variation of the magnetic needle about the year 1756 in all the known seas, &c. By Wm. Mountaine and James Dodson, about isogons, was published in 1758, after Dodson's death./nHis three children were left unprovided for. At a meeting of the general court holden in Christ's Hospital 15 December 1757 a petition was read from William Mountaine, where it was stated that Dodson died 'in very mean circumstances, leaving three motherless children unprovided for, viz. James, aged 15, Thomas, aged 11 and three-quarters, and Elizabeth, aged 8.' The two youngest were admitted into the hospital. After the Equitable Society had started, and fifteen years or more after Dodson's death, a resolution was put in the minutes for giving \u00a3300 to the children of Dodson, as a recompense for the 'Tables of Lives' which their father had prepared for the society. Dodson's eldest son, James the younger (maternal grandfather of Augustus De Morgan), succeeded to the actuaryship of the society in 1764, but in 1767 left for the custom house.", "16678709": "Silvo Breskvar (December 31, 1902 \u2013 January 3, 1969 in  Ljubljana) was a Yugoslav mathematician and physicist.[1]/n/n/nThis article about a European mathematician is a stub.

He is sometimes confused with his rough contemporary, the English mathematician William Burnside.[2]/nWilliam Snow Burnside was born at Corcreevy House, near Fivemiletown, Tyrone, to William Smyth Burnside (1810\u20131884, Chancellor of Clogher Cathedral) and Anne Henderson (1808\u20131881).[3]  He studied mathematics under George Salmon at TCD (BA 1861, MA 1866, Fellowship 1871), and taught there until his retirement in 1917. He served as Erasmus Smiths's Professor of Mathematics for many decades (1879\u20131913), and co-authored the influential 1881 book The Theory of Equations: With an Introduction to the Theory of Binary Algebraic Forms with his TCD colleague Arthur William Panton (1843\u20131906).  It ran to at least 7 editions, and was reissued by Dover Books in 1960.   TCD awarded him DSc in 1891.

Darwin was born at Down House, Kent, the fifth child of biologist Charles Darwin and Emma Darwin./nFrom the age of 11 he studied under Charles Pritchard at Clapham Grammar School, and entered St John's College, Cambridge, in 1863, though he soon moved to Trinity College,[2] where his tutor was Edward John Routh. He graduated as second wrangler in 1868, when he was also placed second for the Smith's Prize and was appointed to a college fellowship. He earned his M.A. in 1871.[2] He was admitted to the bar in 1872, but returned to science.[2] \nGeorge Darwin conducted studies into the prevalence and health outcomes of contemporary first-cousin marriages (such as his parents\u2019) in Great Britain. His father Charles had become concerned after the death of three of his children, including his favourite daughter, Annie, from tuberculosis in 1851, that his and Emma's union may have been a mistake from a biological perspective. He was reassured by George's results.[3]/nAlthough George Darwin was the son of the famous biologist, Charles Darwin, rather than moving predominantly into the field of biology like his father, George instead kept his focus on geology. Subsequently, his efforts within geology caused him to stumble onto many seemingly radical ideas, some of which were related to the notion that preserved within the physical structure of the planet was the mechanical energy (or the collective inertial motion), which may have allowed an ancient rapidly spinning Earth to somehow expel a piece of its mass, and it was this expelled mass which later congealed to create the natural satellite that was now in orbit around the Earth. So, before the Apollo mission and the rise to prominence of the relativistic notion that the origin of the Moon was due in part to collisions within a very active protoplanetary disk, there was a radically different depiction of lunar and planetary evolution, which was proposed by George Darwin, in 1879, called the Fission Theory.[4][5]/nIn 1879, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and won their Royal Medal in 1884 and their Copley Medal in 1911.[6] He delivered their Bakerian Lecture in 1891 on the subject of \"tidal prediction\"./nIn 1883 Darwin became Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy at the University of Cambridge. He studied tidal forces involving the Sun, Moon, and Earth, and formulated the fission theory of Moon formation.[7]/nDarwin was a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) and won the Gold Medal of the RAS in 1892. From 1899\u20131901 he served as President of the RAS.
