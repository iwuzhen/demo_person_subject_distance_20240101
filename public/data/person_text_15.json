{"55102416": "Verena Julia Tunnicliffe OC is a Canadian Marine Biologist and Professor of the University of Victoria. Since 2002, she has held the position of Canada Research Chair in Deep Ocean Research. Her research on hydrothermal systems helped establish Canada's first Endeavor Hot Vents Marine Protected Area. Her research has also led to the discovery of over 80 new species of marine life./nTunnicliffe grew up in Deep River, Ontario. Her fascination with the ocean started at a young age, though she never glimpsed the sea until she was nineteen. It was her mother who introduced her, at age seven, to the ocean. A small wooden box encrusted with seashells, brought back to her from Florida was all it took to begin a lifelong obsession with the sea. Tunnicliffe decided then to become a marine biologist and dedicate her time to learning the name and origin of all the creatures that created those shells.[3] She realised part of that dream during a PhD programme to study coral reefs in Jamaica./nThe early 80s proved fruitful for the young researcher. During a post-doctoral fellowship at the Institute of Ocean Sciences, Tunnicliffe instead became the first woman on the West Coast to lead deep-sea research expeditions from Vancouver Island. She only meant to stay in British Columbia for two years, but by 1983 Tunnicliffe helped to discover hydrothermal vent systems off the coast, explored previously unknown sections of the deep sea, and was part of the discovery of over 80 new marine species.[4]/nTunnicliffe has been a professor at the University of Victoria in the Departments of Biology and School of Earth and Ocean Sciences since 1982.[5] She is a marine biologist who held a Canada Research Chair in Deep Ocean Research until retirement in 2020. As a research chair, her work mainly focuses on the use of submersibles and deep sea observatories to research and discover deep sea ecosystems,  including hydrothermal vents in the Pacific Ocean.[6] Her lab has been working for over 30 years on animals that live near hydrothermal vents in the Pacific Ocean, mainly focusing work in the Juan de Fuca Plate.[7] Her research on hydrothermal systems helped establish Canada's first Marine Protected Area: the Endeavour Hot Vents MPA. In her career thus far, she has discovered over 80 new species of life including ten that are named after her.[8]/nTunnicliffe worked with the Canadian Scientific Submersible Facility to raise funds to equip, run and operate ROPOS, a remotely operated submersible that can go 5000 m depth and currently works throughout the world's oceans. She was the principal lead in the developing and directing operations (for ten years) of the cabled subsea observing network, VENUS, the world's first subsea research system delivering on-line data in 2006. Tunnicliffe is a collaborator with the Canadian Healthy Ocean Strategic Network of researchers who work in collaboration with Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Her main work in the network is discovering ways to conserve the Canadian marine ecosystems in an ocean environment that is changing rapidly.[3]/nMuch of Tunnicliffe's personal life revolves around her career. Her father had a strong influence on her interest in science. He was a nuclear physicist at Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories in Ontario, Canada.[3] He treated Verena and her older brother as equals, making sure they knew skills such as constructing a telescope and tinkering with electronics. Although her father was hesitant to employ women, due to the views of society at the time, he encouraged her to pursue her interests.[citation needed]/nTunncliffe is married to Dr. John Garrett, a marine policy consultant and has a daughter plus three step-children.[3] Tunnicliffe told her daughter to \"follow her passion\" and to \"address your own happiness and health\". Her daughter has an MSc degree in Botany./nSamples include:", "51858384": "Bhabatarak Bhattacharyya (born 1944), popularly known as Bablu Bhattacharyya, is an Indian structural biologist, biochemist and academic, known for his studies on the colchicine-tubulin interaction.[1] He is a former professor and the head of the department of biochemistry at the Bose Institute, Kolkata and an elected fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences, Indian National Science Academy, National Academy of Sciences, India and The World Academy of Sciences.[2] The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 1988, for his contributions to biological sciences.[3]/nBorn on 2 December 1944 in Kolkata, in the Indian state of West Bengal to Bhabaranjan-Malancha couple, Bhattacharyya graduated in chemistry from the University of Calcutta and secured his master's degree in physical chemistry from Rajabazar Science College campus of the same university.[2] Subsequently, he joined the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Kolkata and pursued his doctoral studies to secure the degree under the guidance of Uma Shankar Nandi of the Indian Institute of Science.

He also published works on the algal families Tilopteridaceae (1889) and Sphacelariaceae (1890). Furthermore, he postulated that the encrusting algae genus called Aglaozonia was a stage in the life history of Cutleria. He has been credited for being the first to use the word soralia to refer to the propagule-producing area in lichens in an 1895 publication, introducing a term still in common use.[2] Reinkella, a genus of lichenized fungi in the family Roccellaceae, was named in his honour in 1897.[3][4]/nReinke was a proponent of scientific \"neo-vitalism\", and a critic of the Darwinian theory of evolution.[5] Opposing the secularization of science, Reinke, along with his Lutheran friend Eberhard Dennert, founded the Keplerbund (\"Kepler Association\") in 1907. They opposed Haeckel's Monist League, which aimed to \"replace\" German churches with the evolutionary theory as a secular religion,[6] and attempted to create a branch of popular science grounded in the Christian belief.[7]/nIn 1901 he introduced the term \"theoretical biology\" to define biology from a standpoint of concepts and theories, and to differentiate it from traditional \"empirical biology\".

Hood was one of four children, including a sister and two brothers, including a brother with Down syndrome. One of his grandfathers was a rancher and ran a summer geology camp for university students, which Hood attended as a high school student. Hood excelled in math and science, being one of forty students nationally to win a Westinghouse Science Talent Search.[1] In addition, Hood played several high school sports and debate, the latter of which he would credit for his success in science communication later in his career.[23]/nHood received his undergraduate education from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where his professors included notables such as Richard Feynman[17] and Linus Pauling.[13][1] Hood received an MD from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1964 and a PhD from Caltech in 1968,[24] where he worked with William J.

He coined the term \"P4 medicine\" in 2003.[41][42] \nIn 2010 ISB partnered with the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, Ohio, to establish the nonprofit P4 Medicine Institute (P4MI). Its goal was stated as being \"to lead the transformation of healthcare from a reactive system to one that predicts and prevents disease, tailors diagnosis and therapy to the individual consumer and engages patients in the active pursuit of a quantified understanding of wellness; i.e. one that is predictive, preventive, personalized and participatory (P4).\"[43] \nIn 2012, P4 Medical Institute established an agreement with its first community health partner, PeaceHealth. PeaceHealth is a not-for-profit Catholic health care system, operating in a variety of communities in Alaska, Washington and Oregon.[44][45] In 2016, ISB affiliated with Providence Health & Services,[46] and Hood became the senior vice president of Providence St. Joseph Health and its chief science officer.[37]/nHood has published more than 700 peer-reviewed papers, received 36 patents, and co-authored textbooks in biochemistry, immunology, molecular biology, and genetics. In addition, he co-authored, with Daniel J.

When applied to the study of protein and DNA chemistries, these ideas were essential to the rapid deciphering of biological information.[52][53][54]/nHood had a strong interest in commercial development, actively filing patents and seeking private funding.[55] \nApplied Biosystems, Inc. (initially named GeneCo.) was formed in 1981 in Foster City, California, to commercialize instruments developed by Hood, Hunkapiller, Caruthers, and others.  The company was supported by venture capitalist William K. Bowes, who hired Sam H. Eletr and Andr\u00e9 Marion as president and vice-president of the new company. The company shipped the first gas phase protein sequencer, Model 4790A, in August 1982. The 380 DNA synthesizer was commercialized in 1983, the 430A peptide synthesizer in 1984, and the 370A DNA sequencing system in 1986.[56][5]/nThese new instruments had a major impact on the emerging fields of proteomics and genomics.[3][57] \nThe gas-liquid phase protein sequencer was developed with Michael W. Hunkapiller, then a \nresearch fellow at Caltech.[24][58]  The instrument makes use of the chemical process known as the Edman degradation, devised by Pehr Edman.[58] Edman and Begg's 1967 design involves placing a protein or peptide sample into a spinning cup in a temperature controlled chamber. Reagents are added to cleave the protein one amino acid at the time, followed by solvents to allow extraction of reagents and byproducts. A series of analysis cycles is performed to identify a sequence, one cycle for each amino acid, and the cycle times were lengthy.[59] Hood and Hunkapiller made a number of modifications, further automating steps in the analysis and improving effectiveness and shortening cycle time. By applying reagents in the gas phase instead of the liquid phase, the retention of the sample during the analysis and the sensitivity of the instrument were increased.[58]\nPolybrene was used as a substrate coating to better anchor proteins and peptides,[60] \nand the purification of reagents was improved. HPLC analysis techniques were used to reduce analysis times and extend the technique's applicable range.[58] \nThe amount of protein required for an analysis decreased, from 10-100 nanomoles for Edman and Begg's protein sequencer, to the low picomole range, a revolutionary increase in the sensitivity of the technology.[58][61][16][62] \nThe new sequencer offered significant advantages in speed and sample size compared to commercial sequencers of the time, the most popular of which were built by Beckman Instruments.[55] \nCommercialized as the Model 470A protein sequencer, it allowed scientists to determine partial amino acid sequences of proteins that had not previously been accessible, characterizing new proteins and better understanding their activity, function, and effects in therapeutics. These discoveries had significant ramifications in biology, medicine, and pharmacology.\n[63][5][64]/nThe first automated DNA synthesizer resulted from a collaboration with Marvin H. Caruthers of the University of Colorado Boulder, and was based on Caruthers' work elucidating the chemistry of phosphoramidite oligonucleotide synthesis.[65][66][67] \nCaltech staff scientist Suzanna J. Horvath worked with Hood and Hunkapiller to learn Caruthers' techniques in order to design a prototype that automated the repetitive steps involved in Caruthers' method for DNA synthesis.[68][69] \nThe resulting prototype was capable of forming short pieces of DNA called oligonucleotides, which could be used in DNA mapping and gene identification.[68][5] \nThe first commercial phosphoramidite DNA synthesizer was developed from this prototype by Applied Biosystems,[67] \nwho installed the first Model 380A in Caruthers' lab at the University of Colorado in December 1982, before beginning official commercial shipment of the new instrument.[65] \nRevolutionizing the field of molecular biology, the DNA synthesizer enabled biologists to synthesize DNA fragments for cloning and other genetic manipulations. Molecular biologists were able to produce DNA probes and primers for use in DNA sequencing and mapping, gene cloning, and gene synthesis. The DNA synthesizer played a critical role in the identification of many important genes and in the development of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the critical technique used to amplify segments of DNA a million-fold.[5][6]/nThe first commercial automated peptide synthesizer, sometimes referred to as a protein synthesizer, was developed by Hood and Stephen B. H. Kent, a senior research associate at Caltech from 1983 to 1989.[70][69] The automated, programmable peptide synthesizer had previously been invented and developed by Bruce Merrifield and colleagues at Rockefeller University, and Merrifield received the Novel Prize for this invention [71] The peptide synthesizer assembles long peptides and short proteins from amino acid subunits,[6] in quantities sufficient for subsequent analysis of their structure and function. The commercially available instrument from Applied Biosystems led to a number of significant results, including the synthesis of HIV-1 protease in a collaboration between Kent and Merck and the analysis of its crystalline structure. Based on this research, Merck developed an important antiprotease drug for the treatment of AIDS. Kent carried out a number of important synthesis and structure-function studies in Hood's lab at Caltech.[69]/nAmong the notable of the inventions from Hood's lab was the automated DNA sequencer. It made possible high-speed sequencing of the structure of DNA, including the human genome. It automated many of the tasks that researchers had previously done by hand.[30][72][73] Researchers Jane Z. Sanders and Lloyd M. Smith developed a way to color code the basic nucleotide units of DNA with fluorescent tags, green for adenine (A), yellow-green for guanine (G), orange for cytosine (C) and red for thymine (T).[74] Four differently colored fluorophores, each one specific to a reaction with one of the bases, are covalently attached to the oligonucleotide primer for the enzymatic DNA sequence analysis.[75] During the analysis, fragments are passed downwards through a gel tube, the smallest and lightest fragments passing through the gel tube first. A laser light passed through a filter wheel causes the bases to fluoresce. The resulting fluorescent colors are detected by a photomultiplier and recorded by a computer. The first DNA fragment to be sequenced was a common cloning vector, M13.[74][76][75]/nThe DNA sequencer was a critical technology for the Human Genome Project.[7][75] \nHood was involved with the Human Genome Project from its first meeting, held at the University of California, Santa Cruz, in 1985. Hood became an enthusiastic advocate for The Human Genome Project and its potential.[1][52][77][53] Hood directed the Human Genome Center\u2019s sequencing of portions of human chromosomes 14 and 15.[78][79][80][81][82]/nAt the University of Washington in the 1990s, Hood, Alan Blanchard, and others developed ink-jet DNA synthesis technology for creating DNA microarrays.[83][84] By 2004, their ink-jet DNA synthesizer supported high-throughput identification and quantification of nucleic acids through the creation of one of the first DNA array chips, with expression levels numbering tens of thousands of genes.[9][85] \nArray analysis has become a standard technique for molecular biologists who wish to monitor gene expression.[85] \nDNA ink-jet printer technology has had a significant impact on genomics, biology, and medicine.[86][87][88]/nHood also made generative discoveries in the field of molecular immunology. His studies of the amino acid sequences of immunoglobulins (also known as antibodies) helped to fuel the 1970s\u2019 debate regarding the generation of immune diversity and supported the hypothesis advanced by William J. Dreyer that immunoglobulin (antibody) chains are encoded by two separate genes (a constant and a variable gene). He (and others) conducted pioneering studies on the structure and diversity of the antibody genes. This research led to verification of the \"two genes, one polypeptide\" hypothesis and insights into the mechanisms responsible for the diversification of the immunoglobulin variable genes.[16][89][90][91][54] \nHood shared the Lasker Award in 1987 for these studies.[92]/nAdditionally, Hood was among the first to study, at the gene level, the MHC (major histocompatibility complex) gene family[93][94] and the T-cell receptor gene families[95] as well as being among first to demonstrate that alternative RNA splicing was a fundamental mechanism for generating alternative forms of antibodies. He showed that RNA splicing is the mechanism for generating the membrane bound and the secreted forms of antibodies.[96][97]/nIn neurobiology, Hood and his colleagues were the first to clone and study the myelin basic protein (MBP) gene. The MBP is a central component in the sheath that wraps and protects neurons.[98][99] Hood demonstrated that the condition called \"shiverer mouse\" arose from a defect in the MBP gene. Hood's research group corrected the neurological defect in mice (the shiverer defect) by transferring a normal MBP gene into the fertilized egg of the shiverer mouse. These discoveries led to extensive studies of MBP and its biology.[100]/nBeginning in the 1990s, Hood focused more on cross-disciplinary biology and systems biology. He established in 1992 the first cross-disciplinary biology department, the Molecular Biotechnology Department at the University of Washington.[31][32] \nIn 2000, he co-founded the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB) in Seattle, Washington to develop strategies and technologies for systems approaches to biology and medicine.[11][35][36]/nHood pioneered the systems biology concept of considering human biology as a \"network of networks.\"[101][102] In this model, understanding how systems function requires knowledge of: (1) the components of each network (including genetic, molecular, cellular, organ networks), (2) how these networks inter- and intra-connect, (3) how the networks change over time and undergo perturbations, and (4) how function is achieved within these networks.[103] At the ISB under Hood's direction, genomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and proteomic technologies are used to understand the \"network of networks\" and are focused on diverse biological systems[104] \n(e.g. yeast, mice and humans).[105]/nHood applies the notion of systems biology to the study of medicine,[106][107] specifically to cancer[108] and neurodegenerative disease.[109] His research article on a systems approach to prion diseases in 2009 was one of the first to thoroughly explore the use of systems biology to interrogate the dynamic network changes in disease models. These studies are the first to explain the dynamics of diseased-perturbed networks and have expanded to include frontal temporal dementia and Huntington's disease.[110][111] \nHood is also studying glioblastoma in mice and humans from the systems viewpoint.[112]/nHood advocates several practices in the burgeoning field of systems medicine, including: \n(1) The use of family genome sequencing, integrating genetics and genomics, to identify genetic variants associated with health and disease[113]\n(2) The use of targeted proteomics and biomarkers as a window into health and disease.[114][115] He has pioneered the discovery of biomarker panels for lung cancer[116] and posttraumatic stress syndrome.[117] \n(3) The use of systems biology to stratify disease into its different subtypes allowing for more effective treatment.[118][54] \n(4) The use of systems strategies to identify new types of drug targets to facilitate and accelerate the drug discovery process.[108]/nSince 2002 Hood has progressively expanded his vision of the future of medicine: first focusing on predictive and preventive (2P) Medicine; then predictive, preventive and personalized (3P) Medicine; and finally predictive, preventive, personalized and participatory, also known as P4 Medicine.[119] Hood states that P4 Medicine is the convergence of systems medicine, big data and patient (consumer) driven healthcare and social networks.[118]/nHood envisions that by the mid-2020s each individual will be surrounded by a virtual cloud of billions of data points and will have the computational tools to analyze this data and produce simple approaches to optimize wellness and minimize disease for each individual.[42][53][54] According to this view, the patient's demand for better healthcare will be the real driving force for the acceptance of P4 Medicine by the medical community.  This driving force is exemplified by the movement known as the quantified self, which uses digital devices to monitor self-parameters such as weight, activity, sleep, diet, etc.  His view is that P4 Medicine will transform the practice of medicine over the next decade, moving it from a largely reactive, disease-care approach to a proactive P4 approach that is predictive, preventive, personalized and participatory.[118]/nIn 2010, Hood co-founded the P4 Medicine institute (P4Mi), for the development of Predictive, Preventive, Personalized and Participatory (P4) Medicine.[43] In 2021 Hood founded Phenome Health, a non profit focused on implementing his vision. He argues that P4 Medicine will improve healthcare, decrease its cost and promote innovation.[120]/nLeroy Hood is a member of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS, 1982),[121] \nthe National Academy of Engineering (2007),[122] \nthe National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine, 2003),[123] \nand the National Academy of Inventors (2012).[124] \nHe is one of only 15 scientists ever elected to all three national academies.[125] He is also \na member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1982),[126] \na member of the American Philosophical Society (2000),[127] \na fellow of the American Society for Microbiology,[128] and a charter fellow of the National Academy of Inventors (2012).[129]\n[130] \nHe has received 17 honorary degrees[11] from institutions including Johns Hopkins[131] and Yale University.[132]/nIn 1987 Hood shared the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research with Philip Leder and Susumu Tonegawa for studies of the mechanism of immune diversity.[92] \nHe subsequently was awarded the Dickson Prize in 1988.[133] In 1987, Hood also received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[134]/nHe won the 2002 Kyoto Prize for Advanced Technology for developing automated technologies for analyzing proteins and genes;[2] \nthe 2003 Lemelson-MIT Prize for Innovation and Invention for inventing \"four instruments that have unlocked much of the mystery of human biology\" by helping decode the genome;[135] \nthe 2004 Biotechnology Heritage Award;[136][137] the 2004 Association for Molecular Pathology Award for Excellence in Molecular Diagnostics[138] \nthe 2006 Heinz Award in Technology, the Economy and Employment,[139] for breakthroughs in biomedical science on the genetic level; \ninclusion in the 2007 Inventors Hall of Fame for the automated DNA sequencer;[140] \nthe 2008 Pittcon Heritage Award for helping to transform the biotechnology industry;[141][142] and \nthe 2010 Kistler Prize for contributions to genetics that have increased knowledge of the human genome and its relationship to society.[18] \nLeroy Hood won the 2011 Fritz J. and Dolores H.

He was president of many scientific and professional organizations during his lifetime, including president of the American Public Health Association in 1915. He was one of three founders of the joint MIT-Harvard School of Public Health in 1913./nWilliam T. Sedgwick was born on December 29, 1855, in West Hartford, Connecticut. He was the son of William Sedgwick and Anne Thompson Sedgwick. In 1877, he received his undergraduate degree from the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University. He studied for two years at the Yale School of Medicine, where he was also an instructor in physiological chemistry (1878\u20131879).[1] He left Yale to take up studies at Johns Hopkins University in physiology. He became interested in biology and changed his course of study graduating with a PhD in biology in 1881. He remained at Hopkins for two years as an associate in biology.[2][3]/nIn 1883, Sedgwick was appointed to the faculty at MIT. He was promoted to associate professor in 1884 and to full professor in 1891. He became head of what ultimately became known as the Department of Biology at MIT.[2][4]/nIn 1888, Sedgwick began giving lectures in bacteriology to students in the civil engineering curriculum. His students became the spokesmen and practitioners who brought the principles of public health into the practice of engineering beginning in the 1890s and lasting well into the 20th century.[2][3]/nWhile he has been hailed as the first scientific American epidemiologist, Sedgwick was also described as not having a mathematical mind. He taught ideas and principles to his students.[3] He instilled in his students the need to develop three basic behaviors: a vision of the subject in relation to the broader world, an honest method of working to seek the truth and an enthusiasm for service to the profession the public.[5]/nIn 1902, he published the groundbreaking book Principles of Sanitary Science and the Public Health, which was a compilation of his lectures from the courses he taught at MIT and a distillation of his experience working in the field.[2]/nSedgwick influenced many practitioners in the field of public health. Among the best known are Charles-Edward Amory Winslow, Samuel Cate Prescott, and William Lyman Underwood. He played a key role in Prescott's choice to go into bacteriology as a career, and was instrumental in Prescott's selection in the canning research with Underwood in 1895 \u2013 6 that would lead to the growth of food technology.[6]/nSedgwick\u2019s courses at MIT and his influence on civil engineering students there can be considered the first instructions in the field of public health.[7] However, he and two colleagues felt that a more formal academic structure was needed. In 1913, he joined with George C. Whipple and Milton J. Rosenau to establish the Harvard-MIT School for Public Health Officers. This was the first formal academic program designed to train public health professionals. The joint program lasted until 1922 when Harvard University decided to launch the Harvard School of Public Health.[8]/nBeginning in 1888, Sedgwick was appointed as consulting biologist to the Massachusetts State Board of Health. He directed bacteriological research at the Lawrence Experiment Station and sent his brightest engineering students to work there\u2014including George W. Fuller and Allen Hazen.[2] Even though he was not known for his laboratory research studies, he was responsible, along with George W. Rafter in 1889, for developing the enumeration procedure and apparatus for examining microscopic organisms in surface water bodies.[9]  \nThe Sedgwick-Rafter counting cell is still in use today./nThe Lawrence Experiment Station annual reports highlighted Sedgwick\u2019s role as an epidemiologist.  \u201cIn epidemiology, Sedgwick played a more direct and personal role and he was, indeed, the first scientific American epidemiologist.\u201d[7] Sedgwick used the annual report covering the work done in 1891 as a vehicle to publish his epidemiological studies of typhoid fever.  \u201cIn the Annual Report of the State Board of Health of Massachusetts for 1892, Sedgwick presented studies on typhoid fever epidemics at Lowell and Lawrence, at Springfield and at Bondsville, which were classics in the field and which make this one of the most outstanding volumes in the history of epidemiology.\u201d[10]/nAt the end of the 19th century, the water supply for Jersey City, New Jersey was contaminated with sewage and the death toll from typhoid fever was high. In 1899, the city contracted with a private company for the construction of a new water supply on the Rockaway River, which included a dam, reservoir and 23-mile pipeline.[11] The project was completed on May 23, 1904; however, no treatment was provided to the water supply, because the contract did not require it.  The city, claiming that the contract provisions were not fulfilled, filed a lawsuit in the Chancery Court of New Jersey. Jersey City officials complained that the water served to the city was not \"pure and wholesome.\" Sedgwick testified as an expert witness for the plaintiffs in both trials.  In the first trial, he testified that the water that was supplied to the city was contaminated with bacteria from sewage discharges in the watershed above the reservoir.[11][12]/nIn the second trial, Sedgwick disagreed strongly with the proposal by John L. Leal to treat the water from the reservoir with calcium hypochlorite, which was called chloride of lime at that time.  Instead, he believed that the construction of sewers in the watershed and a sewage disposal plant would be the preferable course of action.  He also testified that chlorination did not remove organic matter, particulates and other filth, which could weaken the vital resistance of water consumers. However, the chlorination system was found to be safe, effective and reliable by the Special Master, William J. Magie, and was judged capable of supplying Jersey City with water that was \"pure and wholesome.\"[11][13]/nSedgwick lived his entire life in New England. He married Mary Katrine Rice of New Haven, Connecticut, on December 29, 1881. They had no children./nSedgwick was a supporter of many causes that furthered the betterment of the public, and he volunteered his time for numerous charitable institutions, including his position of curator of the Lowell Institute beginning in 1897.[14] However, he opposed women\u2019s suffrage and anything that smacked of equality of the sexes. In a long article in The New York Times, Sedgwick stated his views plainly. He believed that women\u2019s suffrage and feminism \"...\u00a0would mean a degeneration and degradation of human fibre which would turn back the hands of time a thousand years.\"[15]/nSedgwick was a prolific writer who published several hundred papers and other writings.[3] His two most influential books were Principles of Sanitary Science and the Public Health and A Short History of Science. In the book A Pioneer of Public Health the authors include a complete list of Sedgwick's publications.[5]/nHe joined the New England Water Works Association in 1890 and was elected president of that organization in 1905. In 1902, he joined the American Public Health Association and became its president in 1915. He helped found the Society of American Bacteriologists (now American Society for Microbiology) and was chosen as president in 1900. He was also president of the American Society of Naturalists in 1900.[3]/nSedgwick became a member of the Advisory Committee of the U.S. Public Health Service in 1902 and was involved in the adoption of the first national standards on drinking water quality\u2014elimination of the common cup in 1912 and bacteriological standards for interstate carriers in 1914. After World War I, he was commissioned as Assistant Surgeon General in the reserves of the U.S. Public Health Service. Also, in 1914, Sedgwick was appointed a member of the Massachusetts Public Health Council, which was a component of the State Department of Public Health. He served on the Committee on Sanitary Engineering and he was Chairman of the Committee on Food and Drugs.[3][16]/nIn 1904, he was made an honorary member of the New England Water Works Association.

In 1991, she joined the genetics department at Baylor College of Medicine.[2]  In 2004, she moved to the Salk Institute.[2]/nIn 1989, Lundblad identified a gene named EST1 (\"ever shorter telomeres\") in which telomeres are lost, and found that EST1 encoded a regulatory subunit of telomerase.[3]  Later, collaborating with Nobel laureate Tom Cech, she discovered the catalytic subunit of telomerase and identified it as a reverse transcriptase with associated RNA.[2]/nIn 2017, three women full professors at the Salk Institute filed gender discrimination suits against the institute, pointing out that research funding was not distributed fairly, that only 13% of the research staff were women, and that of the five smallest laboratory spaces, four were assigned to women, among other problems.[4] Salk Institute responded that Lundblad was  \"consistently ranking below her peers in producing high quality research and attracting\" grant support and that each of the three professors ranked in \"the bottom quartile of her peers\".[4] Scientific colleagues across the country objected to this characterization of Lundblad, including Nobel laureate Carol Greider, whose work also concerns telomerase, and who said Lundblad was \"one of the few icons in the field,\" and that \"for me to read in a press release that she's somehow in the bottom quartile rang really poorly to me.\"[4] In August, 2018, Lundblad settled the lawsuit out of court with undisclosed remedies offered by the institute.[5]/nIn 2014 she was elected to the American Academy of Microbiology \u2014 one of 16 women out of the 88 new fellows that year.[6]/nNugent CI, Hughes TR, Lue NF, Lundblad V.(1996) \"Cdc13p: a single-strand telomeric DNA-binding protein with a dual role in yeast telomere maintenance.\" Science 274(5285):249-52./nLundblad V, Wright WE.

His official botanical author abbreviation is \u201cOberd.\"/n/nOberdorfer was born in Freiburg. \nAfter graduating from high school in 1923, he studied biological sciences at the University of Freiburg and University of T\u00fcbingen. In Freiburg he heard lectures from Hans Spemann and Friedrich Oltmann, among others . In addition to Felix Rawitscher, Walter Zimmermann, who was assistant to Friedrich Oltmanns at the time, was one of his teachers. \nHe graduated in Freiburg in 1928 with a doctorate which he wrote under the direction of Friedrich Oltmanns and the ecophysiologist Bruno Huber, about the relationship between the places where different algae grew on the rock faces of the \u00dcberlinger See and the light conditions at different depths./nOberdorfer initially did not get a job as a teacher because of the economic upheaval in Germany at that time. He was entrusted with a research project on the late and post-Ice Age deposits in the Feldmoos on Schluchsee. This work was supported by the Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft, a forerunner organization of the German Research Foundation, and was undertaken, among other things, because the Schluchsee was to be dammed up to generate electricity. The field moss was to be carefully examined again before it disappeared. Oberdorfer mainly examined the large remains, which he took from depths of up to seven meters using soil auger, and established pollen profiles of the different layers. Among other things, he was able to prove that during the Late Ice Age of the Black Forest the white silver arum Dryas octopetala and the dwarf birch Betula nana as well as several willow species (Salix herbacea, Salix reticulata or Salix myrtilloides) occurred. With his research results, evidence for the climatic fluctuations of the Late Ice Age was available for the Black Forest for the first time. He continued this work during his later position as a teacher until 1939, and became one of the pioneers in the field of pollen analysis in Central Europe./nOberdorfer dealt with various, then new methods of descriptive vegetation science. He learnt to know the plant-sociological method according to Josias Braun-Blanquet through Hermann Otto Sleumer and soon had contact with Braun-Blanquet himself, Reinhold T\u00fcxen and Walo Koch./nIn 1931 Oberdorfer  his first job as a teacher and taught first in Weinheim, then in Bruchsal and Karlsruhe at the grammar school biology and geography. In addition, he also mapped the area around Bruchsal using the Braun-Blanquet method. The result was the Bruchsal vegetation map on a scale of 1: 25,000 in 1936. With this, he had created the second vegetation map with this scale. In 1938 the sheet B\u00fchlertal - Hornisgrinde was to appear, as early as 1937 he had published a vegetation map of Baden 1: 1,000,000./nIn 1937 Oberdorfer was transferred to Karlsruhe, where he initially received half a deputation as a teacher and a position at the Baden Nature Conservation Agency in Karlsruhe under its director Hermann Schurhammer. In 1938, he left school teaching entirely and received a full-time position as a conservator. In doing so, he had to write reports and descriptions of the nature reserves between Lake Constance and the Tauber area, and his trips made him a profound expert on the vegetation of what was then Baden. Work on the plant communities of the Rhine plain, the Black Forest and the Kraichgau later flowed alongside explorations in the Allg\u00e4u and in the Alps in his overview of the southern German plant communities, published in the first edition in 1957, in which he also summarized the vegetation recordings of numerous other plant sociologists. The work appeared in a new edition between 1977 and 1992. With this book, Oberdorfer also significantly shaped the plant-sociological nomenclature not only of southern Germany, but of all of Central Europe./nOberdorfer was a member of the SA and the NSDAP. He had experience with the vegetation of Southeastern Europe as a botanist at the \"Research Season zbV\" where the Lieutenant Schulz-Kampfhenkel used and mapped including in Thessaly, Macedonia, Albania, and Thrace, where he made with colleagues phytosociological recordings and auswertete soil profiles.[1] With studies of the vegetation of northern Spain and a research trip to Chile from 1957 to 1958, he rounded off his knowledge of vegetation outside of Central Europe./nAfter the end of the war Oberdorfer was initially only given occasional jobs due to his membership of the SA and the NSDAP, for example as a research assistant to Heinrich Walter at the University of Hohenheim.  \nStarting 1947, Oberdorfer was employed as a curator at the newly established state agency for nature conservation in North Baden (since 1952 District Office for Nature Conservation and Landscape Management, North Baden) and was its director until 1958. In addition, in 1947 he was also head of the regional collections for natural history in Karlsruhe. After an official director's position was created in 1958 Oberdorfer held this position until his retirement in 1970.\nFrom 1950 Oberdorfer held a teaching position for plant-sociological site studies at the Forestry Faculty of the University of Freiburg and was appointed honorary professor there in 1962./nWhile Oberdorfer's work South German Plant Societies is only known to experts in plant sociology, his plant sociological excursion flora became famous among field botanists. It is the only standard flora in Central Europe that gives detailed ecological information on the species. \"Der Oberdorfer\" was first published in 1949. In 2001 Oberdorfer published the 8th edition of Flora together with Theo M\u00fcller and Angelika Schwabe . With this work, Oberdorfer has made a significant contribution to the shift in field botany from pure floristry to a site-ecological consideration of the vegetation./ntogether with Theo M\u00fcller and Georg Philippi: The potential natural vegetation of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, publications by the State Agency for Nature Conservation and Landscape Management Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (Supplement 6), Ludwigsburg 1974\nas co-author: Der Hohe Schwarzwald, Freiburg im Breisgau 1980, ISBN\u00a03-7930-0250-0 ./nSee also: Forest societies of Central Europe, plant sociological units according to Oberdorfer", "248859": "Herbert Spencer (27 April 1820 \u2013 8 December 1903) was an English polymath active as a philosopher, psychologist, biologist, sociologist, and anthropologist. Spencer originated the expression \"survival of the fittest\", which he coined in Principles of Biology (1864) after reading Charles Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species. The term strongly suggests natural selection, yet Spencer saw evolution as extending into realms of sociology and ethics, so he also supported Lamarckism.[1][2]/nSpencer developed an all-embracing conception of evolution as the progressive development of the physical world, biological organisms, the human mind, and human culture and societies. As a polymath, he contributed to a wide range of subjects, including ethics, religion, anthropology, economics, political theory, philosophy, literature, astronomy, biology, sociology, and psychology. During his lifetime he achieved tremendous authority, mainly in English-speaking academia. Spencer was \"the single most famous European intellectual in the closing decades of the nineteenth century\"[3][4] but his influence declined sharply after 1900: \"Who now reads Spencer?\" asked Talcott Parsons in 1937.[5]/nSpencer was born in Derby, England, on 27 April 1820, the son of William George Spencer (generally called George).[6] Spencer's father was a religious dissenter who drifted from Methodism to Quakerism, and who seems to have transmitted to his son an opposition to all forms of authority. He ran a school founded on the progressive teaching methods of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and also served as Secretary of the Derby Philosophical Society, a scientific society which had been founded in 1783 by Erasmus Darwin, the grandfather of Charles Darwin./nSpencer was educated in empirical science by his father, while the members of the Derby Philosophical Society introduced him to pre-Darwinian concepts of biological evolution, particularly those of Erasmus Darwin and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. His uncle, the Reverend Thomas Spencer,[7] vicar of Hinton Charterhouse near Bath, completed Spencer's limited formal education by teaching him some mathematics and physics, and enough Latin to enable him to translate some easy texts. Thomas Spencer also imprinted on his nephew his own firm free-trade and anti-statist political views. Otherwise, Spencer was an autodidact who acquired most of his knowledge from narrowly focused readings and conversations with his friends and acquaintances.[8]/nBoth as an adolescent and as a young man, Spencer found it difficult to settle to any intellectual or professional discipline. He worked as a civil engineer during the railway boom of the late 1830s, while also devoting much of his time to writing for provincial journals that were nonconformist in their religion and radical in their politics./nSpencer published his first book, Social Statics (1851), whilst working as sub-editor on the free-trade journal The Economist from 1848 to 1853. He predicted that humanity would eventually become completely adapted to the requirements of living in society with the consequential withering away of the state. Its publisher, John Chapman, introduced Spencer to his salon which was attended by many of the leading radical and progressive thinkers of the capital, including John Stuart Mill, Harriet Martineau, George Henry Lewes and Mary Ann Evans (George Eliot), with whom he was briefly romantically linked. Spencer himself introduced the biologist Thomas Henry Huxley, who would later win fame as 'Darwin's Bulldog' and who remained Spencer's lifelong friend. However, it was the friendship of Evans and Lewes that acquainted him with John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic and with Auguste Comte's positivism and which set him on the road to his life's work. He strongly disagreed with Comte.[9]/nSpencer's second book, Principles of Psychology, published in 1855, explored a physiological basis for psychology, and was the fruit of his friendship with Evans and Lewes. The book was founded on the fundamental assumption that the human mind was subject to natural laws and that these could be discovered within the framework of general biology. This permitted the adoption of a developmental perspective not merely in terms of the individual (as in traditional psychology), but also of the species and the race. Through this paradigm, Spencer aimed to reconcile the associationist psychology of Mill's Logic, the notion that the human mind was constructed from atomic sensations held together by the laws of the association of ideas, with the apparently more 'scientific' theory of phrenology, which located specific mental functions in specific parts of the brain.[10]/nSpencer argued that both these theories were partial accounts of the truth: repeated associations of ideas were embodied in the formation of specific strands of brain tissue, and these could be passed from one generation to the next by means of the Lamarckian mechanism of use-inheritance. The Psychology, he believed, would do for the human mind what Isaac Newton had done for matter.[11] However, the book was not initially successful and the last of the 251 copies of its first edition were not sold until June 1861./nSpencer's interest in psychology derived from a more fundamental concern which was to establish the universality of natural law.[12] In common with others of his generation, including the members of Chapman's salon, he was possessed with the idea of demonstrating that it was possible to show that everything in the universe \u2013 including human culture, language, and morality \u2013 could be explained by laws of universal validity. This was in contrast to the views of many theologians of the time who insisted that some parts of creation, in particular the human soul, were beyond the realm of scientific investigation. Comte's Syst\u00e8me de Philosophie Positive had been written with the ambition of demonstrating the universality of natural law, and Spencer was to follow Comte in the scale of his ambition. However, Spencer differed from Comte in believing it was possible to discover a single law of universal application which he identified with progressive development and was to call the principle of evolution./nIn 1858, Spencer produced an outline of what was to become the System of Synthetic Philosophy. This immense undertaking, which has few parallels in the English language, aimed to demonstrate that the principle of evolution applied in biology, psychology, sociology (Spencer appropriated Comte's term for the new discipline) and morality. Spencer envisaged that this work of ten volumes would take twenty years to complete; in the end, it took him twice as long and consumed almost all the rest of his long life./nDespite Spencer's early struggles to establish himself as a writer, by the 1870s he had become the most famous philosopher of the age.[13] His works were widely read during his lifetime, and by 1869 he was able to support himself solely on the profit of book sales and on income from his regular contributions to Victorian periodicals which were collected as three volumes of Essays. His works were translated into German, Italian, Spanish, French, Russian, Japanese and Chinese, and into many other languages and he was offered honours and awards all over Europe and North America. He also became a member of the Athenaeum, an exclusive Gentleman's Club in London open only to those distinguished in the arts and sciences, and the X Club, a dining club of nine founded by T.H. Huxley that met every month and included some of the most prominent thinkers of the Victorian age (three of whom would become presidents of the Royal Society)./nMembers included physicist-philosopher John Tyndall and Darwin's cousin, the banker and biologist Sir John Lubbock. There were also some quite significant satellites such as liberal clergyman Arthur Stanley, the Dean of Westminster; and guests such as Charles Darwin and Hermann von Helmholtz were entertained from time to time. Through such associations, Spencer had a strong presence in the heart of the scientific community and was able to secure an influential audience for his views./nThe last decades of Spencer's life were characterised by growing disillusionment and loneliness. He never married, and after 1855 was a life-long hypochondriac[14] who complained endlessly of pains and maladies that no physician could diagnose at that time.[15] His excitability and sensitivity to disagreement handicapped his social life:/nHis nervous sensibility was extreme. A game of billiards was enough to deprive him of his night's rest. He had been looking forward with pleasure to a meeting with Huxley; but he gave it up because there was a difference on some scientific question between them, and this might have given rise to an argument, which Spencer's nerves could not bear.[16]/nBy the 1890s his readership had begun to desert him while many of his closest friends died and he had come to doubt the confident faith in progress that he had made the centre-piece of his philosophical system. His later years were also ones in which his political views became increasingly conservative. Whereas Social Statics had been the work of a radical democrat who believed in votes for women (and even for children) and in the nationalisation of the land to break the power of the aristocracy, by the 1880s he had become a staunch opponent of female suffrage and made common cause with the landowners of the Liberty and Property Defence League against what they saw as the drift towards 'socialism' of elements (such as Sir William Harcourt) within the administration of William Ewart Gladstone \u2013 largely against the opinions of Gladstone himself. Spencer's political views from this period were expressed in what has become his most famous work, The Man Versus the State./nThe exception to Spencer's growing conservatism was that he remained throughout his life an ardent opponent of imperialism and militarism. His critique of the Boer War was especially scathing, and it contributed to his declining popularity in Britain.[17]/nHe was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1883.[18]/nSpencer also invented a precursor to the modern paper clip, though it looked more like a modern cotter pin. This \"binding-pin\" was distributed by Ackermann & Company. Spencer shows drawings of the pin in Appendix I (following Appendix H) of his autobiography along with published descriptions of its uses.[19]/nIn 1902, shortly before his death, Spencer was nominated for the Nobel Prize for literature, which was assigned to the German Theodor Mommsen. He continued writing all his life, in later years often by dictation, until he succumbed to poor health at the age of 83. His ashes are interred in the eastern side of London's Highgate Cemetery facing Karl Marx's grave. At Spencer's funeral, the Indian nationalist leader Shyamji Krishna Varma announced a donation of \u00a31,000 to establish a lectureship at Oxford University in tribute to Spencer and his work.[20]/nThe basis for Spencer's appeal to many of his generation was that he appeared to offer a ready-made system of belief which could substitute for conventional religious faith at a time when orthodox creeds were crumbling under the advances of modern science.[21] Spencer's philosophical system seemed to demonstrate that it was possible to believe in the ultimate perfection of humanity on the basis of advanced scientific conceptions such as the first law of thermodynamics and biological evolution./nIn essence, Spencer's philosophical vision was formed by a combination of deism and positivism. On the one hand, he had imbibed something of eighteenth-century deism from his father and other members of the Derby Philosophical Society and from books like George Combe's immensely popular The Constitution of Man (1828). This treated the world as a cosmos of benevolent design, and the laws of nature as the decrees of a 'Being transcendentally kind.' Natural laws were thus the statutes of a well-governed universe that had been decreed by the Creator with the intention of promoting human happiness. Although Spencer lost his Christian faith as a teenager and later rejected any 'anthropomorphic' conception of the Deity, he nonetheless held fast to this conception at an almost subconscious level. At the same time, however, he owed far more than he would ever acknowledge to positivism, in particular in its conception of a philosophical system as the unification of the various branches of scientific knowledge. He also followed positivism in his insistence that it was only possible to have genuine knowledge of phenomena and hence that it was idle to speculate about the nature of the ultimate reality. The tension between positivism and his residual deism ran through the entire System of Synthetic Philosophy./nSpencer followed Comte in aiming for the unification of scientific truth; it was in this sense that his philosophy aimed to be 'synthetic.' Like Comte, he was committed to the universality of natural law, the idea that the laws of nature applied without exception, to the organic realm as much as to the inorganic, and to the human mind as much as to the rest of creation. The first objective of Synthetic Philosophy was thus to demonstrate that there were no exceptions to being able to discover scientific explanations, in the form of natural laws, of all the phenomena of the universe. Spencer's volumes on biology, psychology, and sociology were all intended to demonstrate the existence of natural laws in these specific disciplines. Even in his writings on ethics, he held that it was possible to discover 'laws' of morality that had the status of laws of nature while still having normative content, a conception which can be traced to George Combe's Constitution of Man./nThe second objective of the Synthetic Philosophy was to show that these same laws led inexorably to progress. In contrast to Comte, who stressed only the unity of the scientific method, Spencer sought the unification of scientific knowledge in the form of the reduction of all natural laws to one fundamental law, the law of evolution. In this respect, he followed the model laid down by the Edinburgh publisher Robert Chambers in his anonymous Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844). Although often dismissed as a lightweight forerunner of Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species, Chambers' book was, in reality, a programme for the unification of science which aimed to show that Laplace's nebular hypothesis for the origin of the solar system and Lamarck's theory of species transformation were both instances of 'one magnificent generalisation of progressive development' (Lewes' phrase). Chambers was associated with Chapman's salon and his work served as the unacknowledged template for the Synthetic Philosophy.[22]/nSpencer first articulated his evolutionary perspective in his essay, 'Progress: Its Law and Cause', published in Chapman's Westminster Review in 1857, and which later formed the basis of the First Principles of a New System of Philosophy (1862). In it he expounded a theory of evolution which combined insights from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's essay 'The Theory of Life' \u2013 itself derivative from Friedrich von Schelling's Naturphilosophie \u2013 with a generalisation of von Baer's law of embryological development. Spencer posited that all structures in the universe develop from a simple, undifferentiated, homogeneity to a complex, differentiated, heterogeneity while undergoing increasing integration of the differentiated parts. This evolutionary process could be observed, Spencer believed, throughout the cosmos. It was a universal law, applying to the stars and galaxies and to biological organisms, and to human social organisation and to the human mind. It differed from other scientific laws only in its greater generality, and the laws of the special sciences could be shown to be illustrations of this principle./nThe principles described by Herbert Spencer received a variety of interpretations. Bertrand Russell stated in a letter to Beatrice Webb in 1923: 'I don't know whether [Spencer] was ever made to realize the implications of the second law of thermodynamics; if so, he may well be upset. The law says that everything tends to uniformity and a dead level, diminishing (not increasing) heterogeneity'.[23]/nSpencer's attempt to explain the evolution of complexity was radically different from that of  Darwin's Origin of Species which was published two years later. Spencer is often, quite erroneously, believed to have merely appropriated and generalised Darwin's work on natural selection. But although after reading Darwin's work he coined the phrase 'survival of the fittest' as his own term for Darwin's concept,[1] and is often misrepresented as a thinker who merely applied the Darwinian theory to society, he only grudgingly incorporated natural selection into his preexisting overall system. The primary mechanism of species transformation that he recognised was Lamarckian use-inheritance which posited that organs are developed or are diminished by use or disuse and that the resulting changes may be transmitted to future generations. Spencer believed that this evolutionary mechanism was also necessary to explain 'higher' evolution, especially the social development of humanity. Moreover, in contrast to Darwin, he held that evolution had a direction and an end-point, the attainment of a final state of equilibrium. He tried to apply the theory of biological evolution to sociology. He proposed that society was the product of change from lower to higher forms, just as in the theory of biological evolution, the lowest forms of life are said to be evolving into higher forms. Spencer claimed that man's mind had evolved in the same way from the simple automatic responses of lower animals to the process of reasoning in the thinking man. Spencer believed in two kinds of knowledge: knowledge gained by the individual and knowledge gained by the race. Intuition, or knowledge learned unconsciously, was the inherited experience of the race./nSpencer in his book Principles of Biology (1864), proposed a pangenesis theory that involved \"physiological units\" assumed to be related to specific body parts and responsible for the transmission of characteristics to offspring. These hypothetical hereditary units were similar to Darwin's gemmules.[24]/nSpencer read with excitement the original positivist sociology of Auguste Comte. A philosopher of science, Comte had proposed a theory of sociocultural evolution that society progresses by a general law of three stages. Writing after various developments in biology, however, Spencer rejected what he regarded as the ideological aspects of Comte's positivism, attempting to reformulate social science in terms of his principle of evolution, which he applied to the biological, psychological and sociological aspects of the universe. Spencer is also generally credited as the first to use the term 'social structure.'/nGiven the primacy which Spencer placed on evolution, his sociology might be described as social Darwinism mixed with Lamarckism.  However, despite its popularity, this view of Spencer's sociology is mistaken.  While his political and ethical writings had themes consistent with social Darwinism, such themes are absent in Spencer's sociological works, which focus on how processes of societal growth and differentiation lead to changing degrees of complexity in social organization[25]/nThe evolutionary progression from simple, undifferentiated homogeneity to complex, differentiated heterogeneity was exemplified, Spencer argued, by the development of society. He developed a theory of two types of society, the militant and the industrial, which corresponded to this evolutionary progression. Militant society, structured around relationships of hierarchy and obedience, was simple and undifferentiated; industrial society, based on voluntary, contractually assumed social obligations, was complex and differentiated. Society, which Spencer conceptualised as a 'social organism' evolved from the simpler state to the more complex according to the universal law of evolution. Moreover, industrial society was the direct descendant of the ideal society developed in Social Statics, although Spencer now equivocated over whether the evolution of society would result in anarchism (as he had first believed) or whether it pointed to a continued role for the state, albeit one reduced to the minimal functions of the enforcement of contracts and external defence./nThough Spencer made some valuable contributions to early sociology, not least in his influence on structural functionalism, his attempt to introduce Lamarckian or Darwinian ideas into the realm of sociology was unsuccessful. It was considered by many, furthermore, to be actively dangerous. Hermeneuticians of the period, such as Wilhelm Dilthey, would pioneer the distinction between the natural sciences (Naturwissenschaften) and human sciences (Geisteswissenschaften). In the United States, the sociologist Lester Frank Ward, who would be elected as the first president of the American Sociological Association, launched a relentless attack on Spencer's theories of laissez-faire and political ethics. Although Ward admired much of Spencer's work he believed that Spencer's prior political biases had distorted his thought and had led him astray.[26] In the 1890s, \u00c9mile Durkheim established formal academic sociology with a firm emphasis on practical social research.  By the turn of the 20th century the first generation of German sociologists, most notably Max Weber, had presented methodological antipositivism. However, Spencer's theories of laissez-faire, survival-of-the-fittest and minimal human interference in the processes of natural law had an enduring and even increasing appeal in the social science fields of economics and political science, and one writer has recently made the case for Spencer's importance for a sociology that must learn to take energy in society seriously.[27]/nThe endpoint of the evolutionary process would be the creation of 'the perfect man in the perfect society' with human beings becoming completely adapted to social life, as predicted in Spencer's first book. The chief difference between Spencer's earlier and later conceptions of this process was the evolutionary timescale involved. The psychological \u2013 and hence also the moral \u2013 constitution which had been bequeathed to the present generation by our ancestors, and which we in turn would hand on to future generations, was in the process of gradual adaptation to the requirements of living in society. For example, aggression was a survival instinct which had been necessary in the primitive conditions of life, but was maladaptive in advanced societies. Because human instincts had a specific location in strands of brain tissue, they were subject to the Lamarckian mechanism of use-inheritance so that gradual modifications could be transmitted to future generations. Over the course of many generations, the evolutionary process would ensure that human beings would become less aggressive and increasingly altruistic, leading eventually to a perfect society in which no one would cause another person pain./nHowever, for evolution to produce the perfect individual it was necessary for present and future generations to experience the 'natural' consequences of their conduct. Only in this way would individuals have the incentives required to work on self-improvement and thus to hand an improved moral constitution to their descendants. Hence anything that interfered with the 'natural' relationship of conduct and consequence was to be resisted and this included the use of the coercive power of the state to relieve poverty, to provide public education, or to require compulsory vaccination. Although charitable giving was to be encouraged even it had to be limited by the consideration that suffering was frequently the result of individuals receiving the consequences of their actions. Hence too much individual benevolence directed to the 'undeserving poor' would break the link between conduct and consequence that Spencer considered fundamental to ensuring that humanity continued to evolve to a higher level of development./nSpencer adopted a utilitarian standard of ultimate value \u2013 the greatest happiness of the greatest number \u2013 and the culmination of the evolutionary process would be the maximization of utility. In the perfect society, individuals would not only derive pleasure from the exercise of altruism ('positive beneficence') but would aim to avoid inflicting pain on others ('negative beneficence'). They would also instinctively respect the rights of others, leading to the universal observance of the principle of justice \u2013 each person had the right to a maximum amount of liberty that was compatible with a like liberty in others. 'Liberty' was interpreted to mean the absence of coercion, and was closely connected to the right to private property. Spencer termed this code of conduct 'Absolute Ethics' which provided a scientifically-grounded moral system that could substitute for the supernaturally-based ethical systems of the past. However, he recognized that our inherited moral constitution does not currently permit us to behave in full compliance with the code of Absolute Ethics, and for this reason, we need a code of 'Relative Ethics' which takes into account the distorting factors of our present imperfections./nSpencer's distinctive view of musicology was also related to his ethics. Spencer thought that the origin of music is to be found in impassioned oratory. Speakers have persuasive effect not only by the reasoning of their words, but by their cadence and tone \u2013 the musical qualities of their voice serve as \"the commentary of the emotions upon the propositions of the intellect,\" as Spencer put it. Music, conceived as the heightened development of this characteristic of speech, makes a contribution to the ethical education and progress of the species. \"The strange capacity which we have for being affected by melody and harmony, may be taken to imply both that it is within the possibilities of our nature to realize those intenser delights they dimly suggest, and that they are in some way concerned in the realization of them. If so the power and the meaning of music become comprehensible; but otherwise they are a mystery.\"[28]/nSpencer's last years were characterized by a collapse of his initial optimism, replaced instead by a pessimism regarding the future of mankind. Nevertheless, he devoted much of his efforts in reinforcing his arguments and preventing the misinterpretation of his monumental theory of non-interference./nSpencer's reputation among the Victorians owed a great deal to his agnosticism. He rejected theology as representing the 'impiety of the pious.' He was to gain much notoriety from his repudiation of traditional religion, and was frequently condemned by religious thinkers for allegedly advocating atheism and materialism. Nonetheless, unlike Thomas Henry Huxley, whose agnosticism was a militant creed directed at 'the unpardonable sin of faith' (in Adrian Desmond's phrase), Spencer insisted that he was not concerned with undermining religion in the name of science, but to bring about a reconciliation of the two. The following argument is a summary of Part 1 of his First Principles (2nd ed. 1867)./nStarting either from religious belief or from science, Spencer argued, we are ultimately driven to accept certain indispensable but literally inconceivable notions. Whether we are concerned with a Creator or the substratum which underlies our experience of phenomena, we can frame no conception of it. Therefore, Spencer concluded, that religion and science agree in the supreme truth that human understanding is only capable of 'relative' knowledge. This is the case since, owing to the inherent limitations of the human mind, it is only possible to obtain knowledge of phenomena, not of the reality ('the absolute') underlying phenomena. Hence both science and religion must come to recognise as the 'most certain of all facts that the Power which the Universe manifests to us is utterly inscrutable.' He called this awareness of 'the Unknowable' and he presented worship of the Unknowable as capable of being a positive faith which could substitute for conventional religion. Indeed, he thought that the Unknowable represented the ultimate stage in the evolution of religion, the final elimination of its last anthropomorphic vestiges./nSpencerian views in 21st-century circulation derive from his political theories and memorable attacks on the reform movements of the late 19th century. He has been claimed as a precursor by right-libertarians and anarcho-capitalists. Austrian School economist Murray Rothbard called Social Statics \"the greatest single work of libertarian political philosophy ever written.\"[29] Spencer argued that the state was not an \"essential\" institution and that it would \"decay\" as a voluntary market organisation would replace the coercive aspects of the state.[30] He also argued that the individual had a \"right to ignore the state.\"[31] As a result of this perspective, Spencer was harshly critical of patriotism. In response to being told that British troops were in danger during the Second Afghan War (1878-1880) he replied: \"When men hire themselves out to shoot other men to order, asking nothing about the justice of their cause, I don't care if they are shot themselves.\"[32]/nPolitics in late Victorian Britain moved in directions that Spencer disliked, and his arguments provided so much ammunition for conservatives and individualists in Europe and America that they are still in use in the 21st century. The expression \"There is no alternative\" (TINA), made famous by prime minister Margaret Thatcher, may be traced to its emphatic use by Spencer.[33] By the 1880s, he was denouncing \"the new Toryism\", that is, the \"social reformist wing\" of the Liberal Party, the wing to some extent hostile to prime minister William Ewart Gladstone, this faction of the Liberal Party Spencer compared to the interventionist \"Toryism\" of such people as the former Conservative Party prime minister Benjamin Disraeli. In The Man Versus the State (1884), he attacked Gladstone and the Liberal Party for losing its proper mission (they should be defending personal liberty, he said) and instead promoting paternalist social legislation (what Gladstone himself called \"Construction\", an element in the modern Liberal party that he opposed). Spencer denounced Irish land reform, compulsory education, laws to regulate safety at work, prohibition and temperance laws, tax-funded libraries, and welfare reforms. His main objections were threefold: the use of the coercive powers of the government, the discouragement given to voluntary self-improvement, and the disregard of the \"laws of life\". The reforms, he said, were tantamount to \"socialism\", which he said was about the same as \"slavery\" in terms of limiting human freedom. Spencer vehemently attacked the widespread enthusiasm for the annexation of colonies and imperial expansion, which subverted all he had predicted about evolutionary progress from 'militant' to 'industrial' societies and states.[34]/nSpencer anticipated many of the analytical standpoints of later right-libertarian theorists such as Friedrich Hayek, especially in his \"law of equal liberty\", his insistence on the limits to predictive knowledge, his model of spontaneous social order, and his warnings about the \"unintended consequences\" of collectivist social reforms.[35] While often caricatured as ultra-conservative, Spencer had been more radical, or left-libertarian,[36] earlier in his career, opposing private property in land and claiming that each person has a latent claim to participate in the use of the earth (views that influenced Georgism),[37] calling himself \"a radical feminist\" and advocating the organisation of trade unions as a bulwark against \"exploitation by bosses\", and favoured an economy organised primarily in free worker co-operatives as a replacement for wage-labor.[38] Although he retained support for unions, his views on the other issues had changed by the 1880s. He came to predict that social welfare programmes would eventually lead to the socialisation of the means of production, saying \"all socialism is slavery.\" Spencer defined a slave as a person who \"labours under coercion to satisfy another's desires\" and believed that under socialism or communism the individual would be enslaved to the whole community rather than to a particular master, and \"it means not whether his master is a single person or society.\"[39]/nFor many, the name of Herbert Spencer is virtually synonymous with Social Darwinism, a social theory that applies the law of the survival of the fittest to society and is integrally related to the nineteenth-century rise in scientific racism. In his famed work Social Statics (1850), he argued that imperialism had served civilization by clearing the inferior races off the earth: \"The forces which are working out the great scheme of perfect happiness, taking no account of incidental suffering, exterminate such sections of mankind as stand in their way. \u2026 Be he human or be he brute \u2013 the hindrance must be got rid of.\"[40] Yet, in the same work, Spencer goes on to say that the incidental evolutionary benefits derived from such barbarous practices do not serve as justifications for them going forward.[41]/nSpencer's association with social Darwinism might have its origin in a specific interpretation of his support for competition. Whereas in biology the competition of various organisms can result in the death of a species or organism, the kind of competition Spencer advocated is closer to the one used by economists, where competing individuals or firms improve the well-being of the rest of society. Spencer viewed private charity positively, encouraging both voluntary association and informal care to aid those in need, rather than relying on government bureaucracy or force. He further recommended that private charitable efforts would be wise to avoid encouraging the formation of new dependent families by those unable to support themselves without charity.[42] Focusing on the form as well as the content of Spencer's \"Synthetic Philosophy\", one writer has identified it as the paradigmatic case of \"social Darwinism\", understood as a politically motivated metaphysic very different in both form and motivation from Darwinist science.[43]/nIn a letter to the Japanese government regarding intermarriage with Westerners, Spencer stated that \"if you mix the constitution of two widely divergent varieties which have severally become adapted to widely divergent modes of life, you get a constitution which is adapted to the mode of life of neither\u00a0\u2013 a constitution which will not work properly.\" He goes on to say that America has failed to limit the immigration of Chinese and restrict their contact, especially sexual, with the presumed European stock. He states \"if they mix they must form a bad hybrid\" regarding the issue of Chinese and (ethnically European) Americans. Spencer ends his letter with the following blanket statement against all immigration: \"In either case, supposing the immigration to be large, immense social mischief must arise, and eventually social disorganization. The same thing will happen if there should be any considerable mixture of European or American races with the Japanese.\"[44]/nWhile most philosophers fail to achieve much of a following outside the academy of their professional peers, by the 1870s and 1880s Spencer had achieved an unparalleled popularity, as the sheer volume of his sales indicate. He was perhaps the only philosopher in history to sell over a million copies of his works during his own lifetime.[45] In the United States, where pirated editions were still commonplace, his authorised publisher, Appleton, sold 368,755 copies between 1860 and 1903. This figure did not differ much from his sales in his native Britain, and once editions in the rest of the world are added in the figure of a million copies seems like a conservative estimate. As William James remarked, Spencer \"enlarged the imagination, and set free the speculative mind of countless doctors, engineers, and lawyers, of many physicists and chemists, and of thoughtful laymen generally.\"[46] The aspect of his thought that emphasised individual self-improvement found a ready audience in the skilled working class./nSpencer's influence among leaders of thought was also immense, though it was most often expressed in terms of their reaction to, and repudiation of, his ideas. As his American follower John Fiske observed, Spencer's ideas were to be found \"running like the weft through all the warp\" of Victorian thought.[47] Such varied thinkers as Henry Sidgwick, T.H. Green, G.E. Moore, William James, Henri Bergson, and \u00c9mile Durkheim defined their ideas in relation to his. Durkheim's Division of Labour in Society is to a very large extent an extended debate with Spencer, from whose sociology, many commentators now agree, Durkheim borrowed extensively.[48]/nIn post-1863-Uprising Poland, many of Spencer's ideas became integral to the dominant fin-de-si\u00e8cle ideology, \"Polish Positivism\". The leading Polish writer of the period, Boles\u0142aw Prus, hailed Spencer as \"the Aristotle of the nineteenth century\" and adopted Spencer's metaphor of society-as-organism, giving it a striking poetic presentation in his 1884 micro-story, \"Mold of the Earth\", and highlighting the concept in the introduction to his most universal novel, Pharaoh (1895)./nThe early 20th century was hostile to Spencer. Soon after his death, his philosophical reputation went into a sharp decline. Half a century after his death, his work was dismissed as a \"parody of philosophy\",[49] and the historian Richard Hofstadter called him \"the metaphysician of the homemade intellectual, and the prophet of the cracker-barrel agnostic.\"[50] Nonetheless, Spencer's thought had penetrated so deeply into the Victorian age that his influence did not disappear entirely./nIn recent years, much more positive estimates have appeared,[51] as well as a still highly negative estimate.[52]/nDespite his reputation as a social Darwinist, Spencer's political thought has been open to multiple interpretations. His political philosophy could both provide inspiration to those who believed that individuals were masters of their fate, who should brook no interference from a meddling state, and those who believed that social development required a strong central authority. In Lochner v. New York, conservative justices of the United States Supreme Court could find inspiration in Spencer's writings for striking down a New York law limiting the number of hours a baker could work during the week, on the ground that this law restricted liberty of contract. Arguing against the majority's holding that a \"right to free contract\" is implicit in the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote: \"The Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer's Social Statics.\" Spencer has also been described as a quasi-anarchist, as well as an outright anarchist. Marxist theorist Georgi Plekhanov, in his 1909 book Anarchism and Socialism, labelled Spencer a \"conservative Anarchist.\"[53]/nSpencer\u2019s work has frequently been seen as a model for later libertarian thinkers, such as Robert Nozick, and he continues to be read\u2013and is often invoked\u2013by libertarians on issues concerning the function of government and the fundamental character of individual rights.[54]/nSpencer's ideas also became very influential in China and Japan largely because he appealed to the reformers' desire to establish a strong nation-state with which to compete with the Western powers. His thought was introduced by the Chinese scholar Yen Fu, who saw his writings as a prescription for the reform of the Qing state.[55] Spencerism was so influential in China that it was synthesized into the Chinese translation of the Origin of Species, in which Darwin\u2019s branching view of evolution was converted into a linear-progressive one.[56] Spencer also influenced the Japanese Westernizer Tokutomi Soho, who believed that Japan was on the verge of transitioning from a \"militant society\" to an \"industrial society,\" and needed to quickly jettison all things Japanese and take up Western ethics and learning.[57] He also corresponded with Kaneko Kentaro, warning him of the dangers of imperialism.[58] Savarkar writes in his Inside the Enemy Camp, about reading all of Spencer's works, of his great interest in them, of their translation into Marathi, and their influence on the likes of Tilak and Agarkar, and the affectionate sobriquet given to him in Maharashtra \u2013 Harbhat Pendse.[59]/nSpencer greatly influenced literature and rhetoric. His 1852 essay, \"The Philosophy of Style\", explored a growing trend of formalist approaches to writing. Highly focused on the proper placement and ordering of the parts of an English sentence, he created a guide for effective composition. Spencer aimed to free prose writing from as much \"friction and inertia\" as possible, so that the reader would not be slowed by strenuous deliberations concerning the proper context and meaning of a sentence. Spencer argued that writers should aim \"To so present ideas that they may be apprehended with the least possible mental effort\" by the reader./nHe argued that by making the meaning as readily accessible as possible, the writer would achieve the greatest possible communicative efficiency. This was accomplished, according to Spencer, by placing all the subordinate clauses, objects and phrases before the subject of a sentence so that, when readers reached the subject, they had all the information they needed to completely perceive its significance. While the overall influence that \"The Philosophy of Style\" had on the field of rhetoric was not as far-reaching as his contribution to other fields, Spencer's voice lent authoritative support to formalist views of rhetoric./nSpencer influenced literature inasmuch as many novelists and short story authors came to address his ideas in their work. Spencer was referenced by George Eliot, Leo Tolstoy, Machado de Assis, Thomas Hardy, Boles\u0142aw Prus, George Bernard Shaw, Abraham Cahan, Richard Austin Freeman, D. H. Lawrence, and Jorge Luis Borges. Arnold Bennett greatly praised First Principles, and the influence it had on Bennett may be seen in his many novels. Jack London went so far as to create a character, Martin Eden, a staunch Spencerian. It has also been suggested[by whom?] that the character of Vershinin in Anton Chekhov's play The Three Sisters is a dedicated Spencerian. H.G. Wells used Spencer's ideas as a theme in his novella, The Time Machine, employing them to explain the evolution of man into two species. It is perhaps the best testimony to the influence of Spencer's beliefs and writings that his reach was so diverse. He influenced not only the administrators who shaped their societies' inner workings, but also the artists who helped shape those societies' ideals and beliefs. In Rudyard Kipling's novel Kim, the Anglophile Bengali spy Hurree Babu admires Herbert Spencer and quotes him to comic effect: \"They are, of course, dematerialised phenomena. Spencer says.\" \"I am good enough Herbert Spencerian, I trust, to meet little thing like death, which is all in my fate, you know.\" \"He thanked all the Gods of Hindustan, and Herbert Spencer, that there remained some valuables to steal.\" Upton Sinclair, in One Clear Call, 1948, quips that \"Huxley said that Herbert Spencer's idea of a tragedy was a generalization killed by a fact; ...\"[60]/nEssay Collections:/nBiographical/nSources", "72600606": "Chris Greening is a biochemist, microbiologist, and academic.

Later he became a member of the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, England; he acquired British citizenship and had dual British-Argentinian nationality.[17] In 1956, he received an award from the Sociedad Argentina de Investigaci\u00f3n en Bioqu\u00edmica (SAIB) for his work on kinetic studies with the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase. In 1958, funded by the British Council, he joined the Biochemistry Department at the University of Cambridge at Darwin College to work for a PhD under Malcolm Dixon on the mechanism of metal activation of the enzyme phosphoglucomutase.[18] During this work, he collaborated with Frederick Sanger, whose group he joined with a short-term Medical Research Council appointment./nScience will only fulfill its promises when the benefits are equally shared by the really poor of the world/nThe major part of Milstein's research career was devoted to studying the structure of antibodies and the mechanism by which antibody diversity is generated. It was as part of this quest that, in 1975, he worked with Georges K\u00f6hler (a postdoctoral fellow in his laboratory) to develop the hybridoma technique for the production of monoclonal antibodies\u2014a discovery recognized by the award of the 1984 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. This discovery led to an enormous expansion in the exploitation of antibodies in science and medicine. The term hybridoma was coined by Leonard Herzenberg during his sabbatical in Milstein's laboratory between 1976 and 1977.[19]/nMilstein himself made many major contributions to improvements and developments in monoclonal antibody technology\u2014especially in the use of monoclonal antibodies to provide markers that allow distinction between different cell types. In collaboration with Claudio Cuello, he helped lay the foundation for the use of monoclonal antibodies as probes for the investigation of the pathological pathways in neurological disorders as well as many other diseases.[20] Milstein and Cuello's work also enabled the use of monoclonal antibodies to enhance the power of immuno-based diagnostic tests.[21] In addition, Milstein foresaw the potential wealth of ligand-binding reagents that could result from applying recombinant DNA technology to monoclonal antibodies and inspired the development of the field of antibody engineering, which was to lead to safer and more powerful monoclonal antibodies for use as therapeutics./nMilstein's early work on antibodies focused on their diversity at the amino acid level, as well as on the disulfide bonds by which they were held together. Part of this work was done in collaboration with his wife, Celia. The emphasis of his research then shifted towards the mRNA encoding antibodies, where he was able to provide the first evidence for the existence of a precursor for these secreted polypeptides that contained a signal sequence.[22] The development of the hybridoma technology coupled to advances in nucleic acid sequencing allowed Milstein to chart the changes that occurred in antibodies following antigen encounter. He demonstrated the importance of somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin V genes in antibody affinity maturation. In this process, localized mutation of the immunoglobulin genes allows the production of improved antibodies, which make a major contribution to protective immunity and immunological memory. Much of his work in later years was devoted to characterizing this mutational process with a view to understanding its mechanism. He contributed a manuscript[23] for publication on this topic less than a week before he died./nQuite apart from his own achievements, Milstein acted as a guide and inspiration to many in the antibody field, as well as devoting himself to assisting science and scientists in less developed countries.

He was an observer as well as a rigorous experimenter who used careful crossing experiments although he did not inquire into the nature of heritability./nK\u00f6lreuter was the oldest of three sons of an apothecary in Karlsruhe, Germany, and grew up in Sulz. He took an early interest in natural history and made a collection of local insects. At the age of fifteen he went to study medicine at the University of T\u00fcbingen under physician and botanist Johann Georg Gmelin who had returned from St. Petersburg. Gmelin had an interest in floral biology and he reprinted a work by Rudolf Jakob Camerarius (who also taught at T\u00fcbingen) who was the first to demonstrate sexual reproduction in plants. In his inaugural address in 1749 Gmelin talked the need for research on the origin of new species by hybridization. This may have had an influence on K\u00f6lreuter. Gmelin died in 1755, and Kolreuter earned his degree and received an appointment at the Imperial Academy of Sciences at St. Petersburg on 23 December 1755. Here his work included botany as well as the curation of the fish and coral collections. He stayed on until 6 June 1761. From 1759 he experimented on plant hybridization before returning to Germany. He moved to Calw in 1763 and Karlsruhe in 1764 where he was briefly professor of natural history and director of the botanical garden at Baden. He was dismissed from the botanical garden after a dispute with the head gardener in 1783 but stayed as a professor until 1806 when he died.[1]/nK\u00f6lreuter followed the standard idea of the period of plants and nature personified by a Creator. He expected patterns, for instance, homogeneity in the male and female contributions to the progeny. He also strongly believed in epigenetic influences which may have been derived from the teachings of C. F. Wolff. The dominant belief during his time was that an offspring was already preformed in the female or the male and that the embryo was developed after sex and the origin decided the offspring's characteristics or similarities to the parent. K\u00f6lreuter, however noted a mixing of characters and proposed the idea of \u201cseed matters\u201d (Saamenstoffe).[2] According to K\u00f6lreuter there had to be two uniform fluids, male and female semen which combined in the process of fertilization. He believed that equal quantities of the male and female fluid were needed and he therefore examined how much pollen was needed in fertilization of a given number of seeds. In flowers with multiple stigmas, he cut all but one and found that pollinating it was enough to fertilize all the seeds. He examined the action of stigma fluid on pollen, described many plant species, and studied pollen and its transfer.[1]/nK\u00f6lreuter's major works were produced as four reports Vorlaufige Nachricht von einigen das Geschlecht der Pflanzen betreffenden Versuchen und Beobachtungen (1761), Fortsetzung (1763), Zweyte Fortsetzung (1764), and Dritte Fortsetzung (1766). They were reprinted in 1893 in Wilhelm Ostwald's Klassiker der exakten Wissenschaften. Kolreuter's findings are not reported in easy to read sections but are distributed throughout the text. Many parts have not been fully translated to English and this has led to many of the results not being examined well. In all he conducted nearly 500 different hybridization experiments across 138 species and examined the pollen characteristics of over a 1000 plant species. The first documentation of male sterility in 1763 was by K\u00f6lreuter, who observed anther abortion within species and specific hybrids. Koelreuter was the first who reported self-incompatibility in Verbascum phoeniceum plants. He also observed heterosis, that hybrids surpassed their parents. His experimental method included repetitions and controls. He wanted to test if hybrids across species could be fertile. Buffon had used the idea of sterility of crosses as a method of testing species boundaries. Buffon used sterility versus fertility as a criterion for species but he gave up the idea in 1753 when he found fertile hybrids in domestic animals and cagebirds. Linnaeus through his student J. J. Hartmann reported the possibility of new \"species\" arising from hybridization but K\u00f6lreuter was skeptical of the results. In one experiment K\u00f6lreuter sat beside a flower from dawn to dusk and shooed away all insects to find that the flower remained unfertilized. He tested a hypothesis by Jan Swammerdam that honey was nectar that underwent fermentation in the crop of a bee. K\u00f6lreuter collected nectar from many hundreds of orange trees and kept them in vials to evaporate and he reported that it thickened and tasted like honey with time. K\u00f6lreuter  produced interspecific hybrids - specifically the tobacco plants Nicotiana rustica and Nicotiana paniculata in 1760.[3] The hybrids showed male sterility. He also worked on Dianthus and Verbascum. He found that reciprocal crossing produced identical results. He also pondered over the commercial applications of hybridization - \"I would wish that I or somebody else would be so lucky someday to produce a species hybrid of trees which, with respect to the use of its lumber, would have a large influence on the economy. Among other  good properties such trees might perhaps also have the one that they would reach their full size in one half of the time of normal trees\" (translated by Ernst Mayr). Although K\u00f6lreuter conducted a variety of repeated crossing experiments much in the manner of Gregor Mendel, his interpretations were based on alchemical notions and he did not seek to examine the nature of heritability or the particulateness of heritable traits.[1]  K\u00f6lreuter followed an idea from alchemistry that metals were a mixture of mercury and sulphur and considered likewise that an equilibrium of the male and female \"seed matters\" had a role in deciding the qualities of hybrid offspring.[2]/nAlthough Koelreuter did not endorse the transmutation of species, his hybridisation research influenced the development of evolutionary theory in the eighteenth century.[4]/nThe genus Koelreuteria has been named in his honour.", "13945935": "Ayaad Assaad (born 1948) is an Egyptian-American microbiologist and toxicologist.

In the latter case, the downstream signalling of these unbound receptors leads to programmed cell death, also called apoptosis. These receptors have therefore been called \"dependent receptors\" because their presence on the cell surface makes the cell's survival dependent on the presence in the cell environment of its respective ligand.[2] To date, Mehlen and his collaborators have identified or participated in the identification of the most well known dependent receptors./nBeyond the fundamental interest of studying a receptor capable of transducing two antagonistic signals - a \"positive\" one in the presence of ligands leading to cell differentiation, proliferation or migration and a \"negative\" one in the absence of ligands leading to cell suicide, they proposed that this dual function could lead these receptors to play a key role both during embryonic development and in regulating tumorigenesis./nIn the context of their involvement in embryonic development, they hypothesized that the pro-apoptotic activity of these dependence receptors is crucial for the development of the nervous system as a mechanism \"allowing\" neural guidance, migration or localization in ligand situations. Thus, they found that the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) Patched receptor is a dependency receptor and that its ability to induce apoptosis in the absence of Shh is essential for adequate neural tube development.[3][4] They also showed that the receptors of netrin-1 DCC and UNC5H regulate the death/survival of specific neurons during the development of the nervous system.[5][6] This involvement is not limited to the developing nervous system, as they have shown the importance of UNC5H-induced apoptosis in the formation of blood vessels - angiogenesis.[7][8]/nIn the context of cancer, they hypothesized that these receptors are tumor suppressors that would limit cancer progression[9] by inducing apoptosis of tumor cells outside the territories of ligand accessibility/availability.[10][11] They were particularly interested in receptors that bind to the netrin-1 ligand -i.e., DCC and UNC5H-. They have shown that DCC and UNC5H are all dependency receptors in cancer cells: whereas in the presence of their netrin-1 ligand, they transduce classical \"positive\" signals, in the absence of netrin-1, they actively trigger apoptosis.[12][13][14][15][16][17][18] Interestingly, DCC and UNC5H are considered tumor suppressors because their expression is lost in many cancers[19][20] suggesting that the presence of these receptors is a constraint to tumor progression. This has in fact been formally proven by showing that in mice, the invalidation of UNC5H3, the overexpression of netrin-1 in the digestive tract or the specific inactivation of pro-apoptotic DCC activity similarly caused cancer progression.[21][22] Thus, aggressive cancers that develop are cancers for which tumor cells block the pathways of dependent receptors[23][24][25][26] and a mechanism for this inactivation of this cell death pathway is that tumor cells acquire an autocrine secretion of netrin-1. These researchers then showed that an agent blocking the interaction between netrin-1 and its receptors allowed in vitro to lead to the death of tumor cells and in animals to control tumor progression. With this in mind, they have generated a drug candidate - anti-netrin-1/NP137 antibody - which is currently being tested in patients with very advanced cancers with very encouraging signs of clinical activity./nMehlen was elected in 2013 to the French Academy of sciences.[27]", "5557355": "Brian S.

They discovered the seasonality in human circadian rhythms in a temporal isolation facility. They confirmed the seasonality in clock gene expression rhythms in the mouse SCN and identified the SCN regions responsible for the so-called E and M oscillators,[11] which drive the onset and end of the activity.[12]/nEarlier in their careers, in collaboration with Dr. Masaaki Ikeda[13] who discovered Bmal1, Sato Honma and Ken-Ichi Honma were also able to detect circadian rhythms in the Bmal1 gene expression via in situ hybridization in rats\u2019 SCN. They found that Bmal1 expression was highest during the rats\u2019 subjective night and rhythms of mRNA expression were found in other regions of the brain like the hippocampus and the cerebellum. These findings allowed them to deduce that BMAL1 also plays a significant role in regulating circadian rhythms in rats.[14]/nSato Honma and Ken-ichi Honma and their team also found that Dec1 and Dec2 expression regulate the circadian rhythm in the SCN and their gene products suppressed the transactivation of Per(s) by BMAL1/CLOCK heterodimer (similar to CRY(s)/ PER8s. These studies were carried out in collaboration with the Dr. Yukio Kato group. Specifically, they found that Dec1 expression responds differently to light pulses than Dec2, but both of their expression peaks during the subjective day. Dec1 peaks slightly earlier than Dec2. They also discovered that Dec1 expression responds to light in a phase-dependent manner. Authors reported that Dec1 and Dec2 expressed circadian rhythms in constant darkness (DD) and in light-dark conditions and maintained these rhythms with changing light conditions. These findings about the Dec genes are significant in that they form a fifth family of clock-genes that play a part in generating circadian rhythms.[15]/nOf her numerous contributions concerning the central clock in humans and mammals, one of Honma's life-long series of experiments involves methamphetamine (MAP)-induced behavioral rhythms in rodents, which does not depend on the SCN and desynchronizes from the circadian pacemaker in the SCN. They regard the MAP induced behavior rhythm as the model of human sleep-wake cycle which also desynchronizes from the circadian pacemaker. Recently, they found the candidate sites of MAP-induced oscillators called MAO in the dopaminergic system in the brain.[16]/nSato Honma and Ken-ichi Honma have long been involved in the studies of the ontogeny of circadian clocks in nocturnal rodents and clarified the role of nursing mothers on pup circadian clocks. Taking advantage of clock gene Cry double mutant mice, they demonstrated the circadian system of the neonatal SCN was substantially different from that of adult mice. They found multiple clusters of cellular circadian oscillations in the SCN, which have different periods but are able to mutually couple. Neuropeptides in the SCN, AVP and VIP play critical roles in the coupling of cellular oscillation and in the expression of coherent circadian rhythms in adult and neonatal mice.[17]/nHonma's current work focuses on expanding on her previous findings involving the development of circadian rhythms in the mammalian SCN by using novel molecular markers and circadian rhythm-monitoring techniques./nBuilding off of earlier findings that chronic methamphetamine (MAP) induces rhythms that are SCN-independent, Sato Honma and Ken-ichi Honma wanted to study how methamphetamine-induced oscillators (MAO), and food-entrained oscillators (FEO),[18] which are both independent of the SCN, affect the expression of the Per2  gene in rats. Their results, visualized with the Period2-dLuciferase reporter bioluminescence system, showed that after administering MAP, MAO behavior not only was induced but also entrained to light-dark (LD) cycles, with the help of the SCN pacemaker. They found that MAO also occurred in Per2 expression circadian rhythms and phase-shifted these rhythms in regions that do not include the SCN. From these results, they were able to conclude that Per2 rhythms were regulated by both an SCN pacemaker and MAO.[19]/nAdditionally, Honma and her research group at Hokkaido University found daily rhythms of PER2 protein in nasal mucus. PER2 peaks at the beginning of the dark period of each circadian cycle and could potentially be linked to seasonal allergies. The Honma group suggested the use of corticoids to treat allergies during the early evening,  when they are least likely to interrupt the cycling PER2 levels and the circadian clock in the nose.[14]/nSato Honma and Ken-ichi Honma wanted to determine how seasonality in behavior is regulated by the circadian oscillator in rodents\u2019 behavior by examining how clock genes Per1 and Bmal1 expression is associated with the phase of activity onset and offset. They used bioluminescent reporters for each gene, Per1-dLuc and Bmal1-dLuc to monitor their circadian rhythms in freely moving mice. They also administered light pulses and measured the rate of phase shifts for both the rhythms. They found that Per1-dLuc rhythm was delayed instantly in response to the light pulse while that of Bmal1-dLuc was delayed gradually, close to the time of activity offset in mice. These two different responses to light occurred in the same slice of a SCN and allowed them to conclude that the two clock genes Per1 and Bmal1 were regulated by different molecular mechanisms and that there are two different circadian oscillators corresponding to activity onset, known as E and M oscillators.[20]", "71584886": "Alan Ming-ta Wu (1938/1938\u20131981) was a Taiwanese-American molecular biologist and immunologist who developed techniques to grow hematopoetic stem cells in cell culture./nWu was born in Tainan, Taiwan, and attended Chang Jung Senior High School\u00a0[zh] in Tainan.[1] He obtained his medical degree from National Taiwan University Medical School and served for two years as a medical officer in the Republic of China Army.[2][1][3]/nWu conducted research for his PhD in medical biophysics with Till & McCulloch at the Ontario Cancer Institute in Toronto.[4] Wu's PhD work demonstrated the relation between bone marrow and T cells.[5][6] He was the first to grow stem cells (then called colony forming cells) in cell culture.[7] This allowed Wu to transplant a single cell that generated the entire hematopoetic system in a mouse.[4]/nFollowing his PhD, Wu joined Harrison Echols' lab in the US, performing pioneering work on the regulation of viral genes.

He was forced to withdraw the second (1819) book after fierce criticism; the Lord Chancellor ruled it blasphemous. Lawrence's transition to respectability occurred gradually, and his surgical career was highly successful.[1][2] In 1822, Lawrence was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia.[3]/nLawrence had a long and successful career as a surgeon. He reached the top of his profession, and just before his death in 1867 the Queen rewarded him with a baronetcy (see Lawrence baronets)./nLawrence was born in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, the son of William Lawrence, the town's chief surgeon and physician, and Judith Wood.[4] His father's side of the family were descended from the Fettiplace family; His great-great-grandfather (also William Lawrence) married Elizabeth Fettiplace, granddaughter of Sir Edmund Fettiplace.[5] His younger brother Charles Lawrence was one of the founding members of the Royal Agricultural College at Cirencester.[5]/nHe was educated at Elmore Court School in Gloucester. At 15, he was apprenticed to, and lived with, John Abernethy (FRS 1796) for five years./nSaid to be a brilliant scholar, Lawrence was the translator of several anatomical works written in Latin, and was fully conversant with the latest research on the continent. He had good looks and a charming manner, and was a fine lecturer. His quality as a surgeon was never questioned.[6] Lawrence helped the radical campaigner Thomas Wakley found the Lancet journal, and was prominent at mass meetings for medical reform in 1826.[7] Elected to the Council of the RCS in 1828, he became its president in 1846, and again in 1855.[8] He delivered their Hunterian Oration in 1834.[9]/nDuring Lawrence's surgical career he held the posts of Professor of Anatomy and Surgery, Royal College of Surgeons (1815\u20131822); Surgeon to the hospitals of Bridewell and Bethlem, and to the London Infirmary for Diseases of the Eye; Demonstrator of Anatomy, then Assistant Surgeon, later Surgeon, St Bartholomew's Hospital (1824\u20131865). Later in his career, he was appointed Surgeon Extraordinary, later Serjeant Surgeon, to the Queen. His specialty was ophthalmology, although he practised in and lectured and wrote on all branches of surgery. Pugin and Queen Victoria were among his patients with eye problems./nShelley and his second wife Mary Shelley consulted him on a variety of ailments from 1814. Mary's novel Frankenstein might have been inspired by the vitalist controversy between Lawrence and Abernethy,[10] and \"Lawrence could have guided the couple's reading in the physical sciences\".[11] Both Samuel Coleridge and John Keats were also influenced by the vitalist controversy[12]/nDespite reaching the height of his profession, with the outstanding quality of his surgical work, and his excellent textbooks,[13] Lawrence is mostly remembered today for an extraordinary period in his early career which brought him fame and notoriety, and led him to the brink of ruin./nAt the age of 30, in 1813, Lawrence was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1815, he was appointed Professor of Anatomy and Surgery by the College of Surgeons. His lectures started in 1816, and the set was published the same year.[14] The book was immediately attacked by Abernethy and others for materialism, and for undermining the moral welfare of the people. One of the issues between Lawrence and his critics concerned the origin of thoughts and consciousness. For Lawrence, as for ourselves, mental processes were a function of the brain. John Abernethy and others thought differently: they explained thoughts as the product of vital acts of an immaterial kind. Abernethy also published his lectures, which contained his support for John Hunter's vitalism, and his objections to Lawrence's materialism.[15]/nIn subsequent years Lawrence vigorously contradicted his critics until, in 1819, he published a second book, known by its short title of the Natural history of man.[16] The book caused a storm of disapproval from conservative and clerical quarters for its supposed atheism, and within the medical profession because he advocated a materialist rather than vitalist approach to human life. He was linked by his critics with such other 'revolutionaries' as Thomas Paine and Lord Byron. It was \"the first great scientific issue that widely seized the public imagination in Britain, a premonition of the debate over Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, exactly forty years later\".[17]/nHostility from the established Church of England was guaranteed. \"A vicious review in the Tory Quarterly Review execrated his materialist explanation of man and mind\";[18][19][20] the Lord Chancellor, Lord Eldon, in the Court of Chancery (1822), ruled his lectures blasphemous, on the grounds that the book contradicted Holy Scripture (the Bible). This destroyed the book's copyright.[21] Lawrence was also repudiated by his own teacher, John Abernethy, with whom he had already had a controversy about John Hunter's teachings. There were supporters, such as Richard Carlile and Thomas Forster, and \"The Monthly Magazine\", in which Lawrence was compared to Galileo. However, faced with persecution, perhaps prosecution, and certainly ruin through the loss of surgical patients, Lawrence withdrew the book and resigned from his teaching position.[22] The time had not yet arrived when a science which dealt with man as a species could be conducted without interference from the religious authorities./nIt is interesting that the Court of Chancery was acting, here, in its most ancient role, that of a court of conscience. This entailed the moral law applied to prevent peril to the soul of the wrongdoer through mortal sin. The remedy was given to the plaintiff (the Crown, in this case) to look after the wrongdoer's soul; the benefit to the plaintiff was only incidental. This is also the explanation for specific performance, which compels the sinner to put matters right. The whole conception is medi\u00e6val in origin./nIt is difficult to find a present-day parallel. The withholding of copyright, though only an indirect financial penalty, was both an official act and a hostile signal. We do not seem to have a word for this kind of indirect pressure, though suppression of dissent comes closer than censorship. Perhaps the modern 'naming and shaming' comes closest. The importance of respectability, reputation and public standing were critical in this case, as so often in traditional societies./nAfter repudiating his book, Lawrence returned to respectability, but not without regrets. He wrote in 1830 to William Hone, who was acquitted of libel in 1817, explaining his expediency and commending Hone's \"much greater courage in these matters\".[23]/nHis last major contribution to the debate was an article on \"Life\" in the 1819 Rees's Cyclopaedia[24] although this volume had in fact appeared in 1812./nHe continued to espouse radical ideas and, led by the famous radical campaigner Thomas Wakley, Lawrence was part of the small group which launched The Lancet, and wrote material for it. Lawrence wrote pungent editorials, and chaired the public meetings in 1826 at the Freemasons' Tavern. He was also co-owner of the Aldersgate Private Medical Academy, with Frederick Tyrrell./nMeetings for members of the college were attended by about 1200 people.[25] The meetings were called to protest against the way surgeons abused their privileges to set student fees and control appointments./nIn his opening speech Lawrence criticised the by-laws of the College of Surgeons for preventing all but a few teachers in London, Dublin, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen from issuing certificates of attendance at preparatory lectures. He pointed out that Aberdeen and Glasgow had no cadavers for dissection, without which anatomy could not be properly taught./nA proposed change in the regulations of the College of Surgeons would soon cut the ground from under the private summer schools, since diplomas taken in the summer were not to be recognised./nLawrence concluded by protesting against the exclusion of the great provincial teachers from giving recognised certificates.[26]/nHowever, gradually Lawrence conformed more to the style of the College of Surgeons, and was elected to their Council in 1828. This somewhat wounded Wakley, who complained to Lawrence, and made some remarks in the Lancet. But, true to form, Wakley soon saw Lawrence's rise in the college as providing him with an inside track into the working of the institution he was hoping to reform. For some years Lawrence hunted with the Lancet and ran with the college. From the inside, Lawrence was able to help forward several of the much-needed reforms espoused by Wakley. The College of Surgeons was at last reformed, to some extent at least, by a new charter in 1843.[27]/nThis episode marks Lawrence's return to respectability; in fact, Lawrence succeeded Abernethy as the 'dictator' of Bart's./nHis need for respectability and worldly success might have been influenced by his marriage in 1828, at the age of 45, to the 25-year-old socially ambitious Louisa Senior.[28]/nAt any rate, from then on Lawrence's career went ever forward. He never looked back: he became President of the Royal College of Surgeons, and Serjeant-Surgeon to Queen Victoria. Before he died she made him a baronet.  He had for many years declined such honours, and family tradition was that he finally accepted to help his son's courtship of an aristocratic young woman (which did not succeed). \"Never again [did] he venture to express his views on the processes of evolution, on the past or the future of man.\"[29] He did, however, warn the young T.H. Huxley \u2013 in vain, it must be said \u2013 not to broach the dangerous topic of the evolution of man.[30]/nIn 1844 Carl Gustav Carus, the physiologist and painter, made \"a visit to Mr Lawrence, author of a work on the \"Physiology of Man\" which had interested me much some years ago, but which had rendered the author obnoxious to the clergy...  He appears to have allowed himself to be frightened by this, and is now merely a practising surgeon, who keeps his Sunday in the old English fashion, and has let physiology and psychology alone for the present.  I found him a rather dry, but honest man\".[31] Looking back in 1860 on his controversies with Abernethy, Lawrence wrote of \"events which though important at the time of occurrence have long ceased to occupy my thoughts\".[32]/nIn 1828, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and in 1855 a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[33]/nThe careful anonymity in which the Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation was published in 1844, and the very great caution shown by Darwin in publishing his own evolutionary ideas, can be seen in the context of the need to avoid a direct conflict with the religious establishment. In 1838 Darwin referred in his \"C\" transmutation notebook to a copy of Lawrence's \"Lectures on physiology, zoology, and the natural history of man\", and historians have speculated that he brooded about the implied consequences of publishing his own ideas.[34]/nIn Lawrence's day the impact of laws on sedition and blasphemy were even more threatening than they were in Darwin's time.[35] Darwin referred to Lawrence (1819) six times in his Descent of man (1871).[36]/nLawrence's Natural history of man contained some remarkable anticipations of later thought, but was ruthlessly suppressed. To this day, many historical accounts of evolutionary ideas do not mention Lawrence's contribution. He is omitted, for example, from many of the Darwin biographies,[37] from some evolution textbooks,[38] essay collections,[39] and even from accounts of pre-Darwinian science and religion.[40]/nAlthough the only idea of interest which Darwin found in Lawrence was that of sexual selection in man, the influence on Alfred Russel Wallace, was more positive. Wallace \"found in Lawrence a possible mechanism of organic change, that of spontaneous variation leading to the formation of new species\".[2]/nLawrence was one of three British medical men who wrote on evolution-related topics from 1813 to 1819. They would all have been familiar with Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck at least; and probably also Malthus. Two (Prichard and Lawrence) dedicated their works to Blumenbach, the founder of physical anthropology. \"The men who took up the challenge of Lamarck were three English physicians, Wells, Lawrence and Prichard... All three men denied soft heredity (Lamarckism)\"[41] This account is not too accurate in biographical terms, as Lawrence was actually a surgeon, Wells was born in Carolina to a Scottish family, and Prichard was a Scot. However, it is correct in principle on the main issue. Each grasped aspects of Darwin's theory, yet none saw the whole picture, and none developed the ideas any further. The later publication of Robert Chambers' Vestiges and Matthew's Naval timber[42] was more explicit; the existence of the whole group suggests there was something real (though intangible) about the intellectual atmosphere in Britain which is captured by the phrase 'evolution was in the air'./nThe years 1815\u20131835 saw much political and social turmoil in Britain, not least in the medical profession. There were radical medical students and campaigners in both Edinburgh and London, the two main training centres for the profession at the time. Many of these were materialists who held views favouring evolution, but of a Lamarckian or Geoffroyan kind.[43] It is the allegiance to hard inheritance or to natural selection which distinguishes Lawrence, Prichard and Wells, because those ideas have survived, and are part of the present-day account of evolution./nThe existence of races is a token of change in the human species, and suggests there is some significance in geographical separation. Lawrence noted that racial characteristics were inherited, not caused by the direct effect of, for instance, climate. As an example, he considered the way skin colour was inherited by children of African origin when born in temperate climates: how their colour developed without exposure to the sun, and how this continued through generations. This was evidence against the direct effect of climate./nLawrence's ideas on heredity were many years ahead of their time, as this extract shows: \"The offspring inherit only [their parents'] connate peculiarities and not any of the acquired qualities\". This is as clear a rejection of soft inheritance as one can find. However, Lawrence qualified it by including the origin of birth defects owing to influences on the mother (an old folk superstition). So Mayr places Wilhelm His, Sr. in 1874 as the first unqualified rejection of soft inheritance.[44][45] However, the number of places in the text where Lawrence explicitly rejects the direct action of the environment on heredity justifies his recognition as an early opponent of Geoffroyism./nHere, as seen by Cyril Darlington, are some of the ideas presented by Lawrence in his book, much abbreviated and rephrased in more modern terms:/nDarlington's account goes further than other commentators. He seems to credit Lawrence with a modern appreciation of selection (which he definitely did not have); subsequently, Darlington's account was criticised as an over-statement.[47] Darlington does not claim Lawrence actually enunciated a theory of evolution, though passages in Lawrence's book do suggest that races were historically developed. On heredity and adaptation, and the rejection of Lamarckism (soft inheritance), Lawrence is quite advanced./nLecture I: introductory to the lectures of 1817.Reply to the charges of Mr Abernethy; Modern history and progress of comparative anatomy./nThis follows the first publication of Lawrence's ideas in 1816, and Abernethy's criticism of them in his lectures for 1817.[48]/nThe early part of the 1819 book is marked by Lawrence's reaction to Abernethy's attack on the 'materialism' of the first book. After a long preamble, in which Lawrence extols the virtues of freedom of speech, he eventually gets to the point:/nLawrence is here arguing that medical questions should be answered by medical evidence, in other words, he is arguing for rational thought and empiricism instead of revelation or received religion. In particular, he insisted that mental activity was produced as a function of the brain, and has nothing to do with metaphysical concepts such as the 'soul'. Also, there is an implication, never quite stated, that Abernethy's motive might be venal; that jealousy (for example) might be revealed by \"a consideration of the real motives\" (phrase from his long initial footnote). It is absolutely clear that the conflict predates the publication of Lawrence's book./nThe discussion drawn from stratigraphy is interesting:/nRefers to Cuvier, Brongniart and Lamarck in France, and Parkinson in Britain in connection with fossils:/nChapter VII raises the issue of whether different races have similar diseases (p162 et seq) and ends with a list of reasons for placing man in one distinct species. The reasons are mostly anatomical with some behavioural, such as speech. They remain valid today./nNext there is a lengthy discussion of variation in man, and of the differences between races. Then he considers causation. Lectures of 1818, Chapter IX: On the causes of the varieties of the human species:/nHe shows clearly in several places that differences between races (and between varieties of domesticated animals) are inherited, and not caused by the direct action of the environment; then follows this admission:/nSo, after insisting on empirical (non-religious) evidence, he has clearly rejected Lamarckism but has not thought of natural selection./nAlthough in places Lawrence disclaims all knowledge of how the differences between races arose, elsewhere there are passages which hint at a mechanism. In Chapter IX, for example, we find:/nPassages like this are interpreted by Darlington in his first two points above; there is more on variety and its origin in Chapter IV, p67-8. It is clear that Lawrence's understanding of heredity was well ahead of his time, (ahead of Darwin, in fact) and that he only lacks the idea of selection to have a fully-fledged theory of evolution./nAt least five people have been claimed as the first to use the word biology:[49]/nDirect contradiction of the Bible was something Lawrence might have avoided, but his honesty and forthright approach led him onto this dangerous ground:/nPassages such as these, fully in the tradition of British empiricism and the Age of Enlightenment, were no doubt pointed out to the Lord Chancellor. In his opinion, the subject was not open for discussion./nIn June 1838, Lawrence purchased the Ealing Park mansion along with the surrounding 100 acres known as \"Little Ealing\" (then in Middlesex) at a purchase price of \u00a39,000 (equivalent to \u00a3862,000 in 2021).[52] Ealing Park is described by Pevsner as \"Low and long; nine bays with pediment over the centre and an Ionic one-storeyed colonnade all along.\"[53] The property was grandly furnished, as may be seen from the catalogue of the sale of the contents after her death.[54] The estate boasted livestock, including poultry of all sorts, cows, sheep and pigs. There were thousands of bedding plants, \"tove plants, more than 600 plants in early forcing houses, nearly a hundred camellias, and more./nHowever, they mainly lived on Whitehall Place in City of Westminster. His son later sold Ealing Park./nOn 4 August 1823, Lawrence married Louisa Senior (1803\u20131855), the daughter of a Mayfair haberdasher, who built up social fame through horticulture. They had two sons and three daughters. Their elder son died in childhood but their second son, Sir Trevor Lawrence, 2nd Baronet, was himself a prominent horticulturist and was for many years President of the Royal Horticultural Society. One daughter died at age 18 months and the other two died unmarried.[5][55]/nLouisa Lawrence died 14 August 1855. Lawrence suffered an attack of apoplexy whilst descending the stairs at the College of Surgeons and died on 5 July 1867 at his house, 18 Whitehall Place, London.", "63556731": "Giuseppe Montalenti (13 December 1904 - 2 July 1990) was an Italian geneticist and zoologist.

Porter's research at Harvard concerned the sarcoplasmic reticulum and T system; he conducted this work in collaboration with Clara Franzini-Amstrong. He then explored the role of microtubules in motility, cell division, and control of cell shape with Lewis Tilney, J. Richard McIntosh, and Ursula Goodenough-Johnson.[4]/nIn 1968, Porter left to work as chair of the new Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology at the University of Colorado Boulder. Porter spearheaded a laboratory dedicated to a higher voltage (1000 kV) electron microscope that improved the ability to examine the interior of cells by virtue of its high penetrating power.[5] When he retired, at age 70, the university awarded him an honorary degree and renamed \"his\" building Porter Biosciences./nPorter became a professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) in 1984 before joining Lee D. Peachey\u2019s laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania in 1988, post-retirement. UMBC's Keith R.

On his return to India, he joined the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) as a member of faculty at the division of biological sciences, subsequently became an associate professor at the Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology[3] and continues his association with IISc, serving as a professor.[4][5] He also heads the research group, popularly known as Prof. Kumar Somasundaram's Lab.[6]/nSomasundaram resides in IISc housing colony in Bengaluru, Karnataka.[7]/nSomasundaram's work is centered around the studies of oncoviruses, tumor suppressor genes, gliomas and microRNAs and he has done advanced research on glioblastoma, an aggressive form of cancer affecting the brain.[8][9] The group led by him is engaged in work concerning the determination of the role of cellular tumor antigen p53 in glioma, regulating the protein, p73 in cervical cancer patients, using Adenovirus early region 1A, a tumor suppressor gene, the analytical study of BRCA1 gene in breast cancer and the analysis and regulation of SV2A, a synaptic vesicle protein.[3] He demonstrated that glioblastoma spreads rapidly by producing macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) in large quantities which in turn stimulate the growth of blood vessels in the tumor.[10] He proposed that the MCSF interacted with the anti-tumor microglial cells of the human body and induced them to produce Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP1), thereby impairing the capacity of microglial cells to fight the tumor cells, a process he called befriending. The discovery of this new molecule, IGFBP1 and its role in glioma angiogenesis, led to a collaborative investigation which involved four research institutions namely National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Medical Sciences and Institute for Functional Genomics (INSERM) of the University of Montpellier, apart from the IISc.[11] The research team led by Somasundaram and Phillipe Marin of INSERM validated the earlier findings and proposed a new therapeutic protocol for glioblastoma which targeted IGFBP1, rather than Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which earlier treatment methods attacked.[12] The researchers, later, released their findings through a paper, Glioblastoma-derived Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (MCSF) Induces Microglial Release of Insulin-like Growth Factor-Binding Protein 1 (IGFBP1) to Promote Angiogenesis, published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry.[13] Work is in progress at his laboratory for developing biomarkers (twenty genes of which is named gene X, have already been discovered)[14] for which detailed study is being conducted on microRNA, DNA methylation, modifications of chromatin and gene fusions.[4][15] His studies have been documented by way of a number of articles[16][17][note 1] and ResearchGate, an online repository of scientific articles has listed 178 of them.[18] He has also conducted workshops[19][20][21] including the Workshop on Next Generation Sequencing organized by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research in November 2013[22] and has delivered invited or plenary speeches at various conferences and seminars[23] and the 5th annual meeting of the Proteomics Society, India held in September 2013 was one among them.[24]/nSomasundaram is credited with the establishment of the first laboratory for molecular oncology at the IISc and his contributions are also reported in the establishment of a facility for genomics at the institute.[2] He has undertaken many research programs in cancer biology which included the IISC initiative on Cancer Biology and Therapeutics.

Kanazawa's comments and research on race and intelligence, health and intelligence, multiculturalism, and the relationship between physical attractiveness and intelligence have led to condemnation from observers and colleagues. Critics have described his claims as pseudoscientific[4][3] and racist.[5][6]/nIn response to ongoing controversies over his stated views, such as that Sub-Saharan Black African countries suffer from chronic poverty and disease because their people have lower IQs, and that black women are objectively less attractive than women of other races, he was dismissed from writing for Psychology Today, and his employer, the London School of Economics, prohibited him from publishing in non-peer-reviewed outlets for 12 months.[7] A group of 68 evolutionary psychologists issued an open letter titled \"Kanazawa's bad science does not represent evolutionary psychology\" rejecting his views,[8] and an article on the same theme was published by 35 academics in American Psychologist.[9]/nKanazawa received his PhD in 1994 from the University of Arizona.[10]/nKanazawa began working at the London School of Economics in 2003.[11]/nKanazawa has co-written three books with Alan Miller:/nHe also wrote a blog, The Scientific Fundamentalist, for Psychology Today until his dismissal in 2011.[12]/nKanazawa uses the term Savanna principle to denote his hypothesis that societal difficulties exist because \"the human brain\" evolved in Africa hundreds of thousands of years ago, a drastically different environment from today's urban, industrial society.[13] In 2003, in an article in the Journal of Research in Personality, he claimed to show that scientists generally made their biggest discoveries before their mid-30s, and compared this productivity curve to that of criminals.[14]/nIn 2006, he published an article in the Journal of Theoretical Biology, claiming that attractive people are 26% less likely to have male offspring.[15][16] In a letter to the editors regarding Kanazawa's claim that attractive people are more likely to have daughters,[17] Columbia statistician Andrew Gelman points out that a correct interpretation of the regression coefficients in Kanazawa's analysis is that attractive people are 8% more likely to have girls, an error that Kanazawa acknowledges.[18] Gelman argues that Kanazawa's analysis does not convincingly show causality, because of possible endogeneity as well as problematic interpretations of statistical significance in multiple comparisons. While Kanazawa claims that the former error is \"merely linguistic\" and that he addressed the latter two in his initial article,[16] Gelman maintains that his original criticism remains valid.[19]/nIn May 2011, he published an article in Psychology Today that explored why black women had been rated less attractive than women of other races in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Subsequent critical independent analysis of the results showed that the difference in assessed attractiveness held for three of the four data sets in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and that there was only a statistically significant race difference in younger women and that it disappeared by early adulthood.[20] Applying his same reasoning to males, Kanazawa also concluded in his article that black men would generally be considered more attractive than black women. Kanazawa was also criticised for arguing that the common factor of subjective interviewer ratings of attractiveness used in his analysis constitutes an objective scale of attractiveness.[3]/nThe article caused outrage and was widely criticised. The first criticisms were published in the blogosphere leading to the creation of petitions on Change.org and Facebook to have Kanazawa fired.[21] Also other scientists, including a group of evolutionary psychologists publishing a joint statement published criticisms, distancing the discipline of evolutionary psychology from Kanazawa's research.[8] Psychology Today pulled the article and on 27 May 2011, issued an apology to anyone who had been offended and stated that they had not reviewed Kanazawa's article before its publication,[22] and stated that they would police more strictly for controversial content in the future.[12]/nIn September 2011, Kanazawa apologised to LSE director Judith Rees, saying he \"deeply regrets\" the \"unintended consequences\" of the blog and accepting that \"some of [his] arguments may have been flawed and not supported by the available evidence\". An internal LSE investigation found that Kanazawa had brought the school into disrepute and prohibited him from publishing in non-peer-reviewed outlets for a year.[23] Following the controversy, an open letter was signed by 68 evolutionary psychologists distancing themselves from Kanazawa and defending evolutionary psychology, writing \"The principle of applying evolutionary theory to the study of human psychology and behaviour is sound, and there is a great deal of high-quality, nuanced, culturally-sensitive evolutionary research ongoing in the UK and elsewhere today\".[8] In response, an international group of 23 scientists published a letter in Times Higher Education defending Kanazawa's work.[24]/nIn 2006, Kanazawa used the \"Savanna principle\" to explain the correlation of health and IQ vs. health and wealth. \nHe argued that IQ is a better predictor for health than wealth or inequality in most regions of the world, except in Sub-Saharan Africa, where health is more strongly correlated to wealth than to IQ. He claimed that this was because Sub-Saharan Africa represents an \"evolutionarily familiar\" environment with lesser selection pressure on IQ than elsewhere.[25] In a criticism of the paper, George Ellison (2007) argued that the conclusion was based on \"flawed assumptions, questionable data, inappropriate analysis and biased interpretations\".[26]/nAccording to neuroscientist Simon LeVay, an early review in academic literature suggested that gays and lesbians were more intelligent than their peers, although this may have suffered from volunteer bias. In 2012, however, Kanazawa published an analysis of three large-scale randomly sampled studies from the U.S. and U.K., and found that in both males and females, homosexuals scored higher for intelligence. LeVay writes that these findings are \"suggestive\" of a link between homosexuality and intelligence, but notes that smarter people may be more likely to be open about their sexuality than less intelligent people, so these results may also suffer from bias.[27]/nIn his blog The Scientific Fundamentalist, hosted by Psychology Today, Kanazawa published often on Muslims, Islam and the Middle East. The publication Psychology Today later received a significant amount of negative but constructive feedback and criticism following some of Kanazawa's more controversial articles./nOn 6 March 2008, in the article subtitled \"All you need is hate\", he suggested a \"little thought experiment\", asking his readers to \"(i)magine that, on September 11, 2001, when the Twin Towers came down, the President of the United States was not George W. Bush, but Ann Coulter. What would have happened then? On September 12, President Coulter would have ordered the US military forces to drop 35 nuclear bombs throughout the Middle East, killing all of our actual and potential enemy combatants, and their wives and children. On September 13, the war would have been over and won, without a single American life lost\". He concludes, \"(y)es, we need a woman in the White House, but not the one who's running\", suggesting that in his opinion someone like Ann Coulter is preferable.[28]/nOn 10 January 2010, he posted an article titled \"What's Wrong with Muslims?\" In it, he claims that Muslims \"are all united in their values and goals by their singular identity of being Muslims\", and that although it may be \"tempting to dismiss these observations\", and \"politically correct and comforting\" to say that terrorists are 'extremists' or 'jihadists', that would be \"factually inaccurate\", he claims.[29]\nHe further elaborated on his views seven days later, on 17 January, in another article on the same website. In its intro he claims that \"Racial profiling works and saves lives\". Although, at some point through this article, he dismisses an Islamophobic stereotype expressed through the media trope \"Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims\", but follows it with one of his own, writing: \"half of Muslims worldwide are terrorists or active supporters of terrorism, who would encourage their sons, brothers, and nephews to blow themselves up.\"[30]/nIn the article titled \"Is Your Professor an Islamophobe?\", at the time Columbia University epidemiologist and HuffPost contributor, Abdul El-Sayed, quoted Kanazawa's articles, along with some other authors', when he discussed the phenomenon of \"a growing number of academics using (their) intellectual identity to promote intolerance and xenophobia against Islam and Muslims\". El-Sayed expressed concern that, as he writes, \"the fundamental messages portrayed in the public musings of academics are no different from the crude ramblings of a Glenn Beck or a Rush Limbaugh, they are many times more damaging\". He explains how \"PhD's and daunting lists of academic publications to their names, academics are perceived to carry the weighty, objective backing of \"knowledge\" and \"science\" by the lay-public, so bigoted, ignorant opinions on their parts are taken as justification to those who already hold skewed perspectives and hateful opinions about Islam and Muslims\". He points out that \"these academic dogmatists cloak (perhaps under their PhD hoods) the fire of Islamophobia with the cool, measured tones of objectivity\".[31]/nNanjala Nyabola, writing in The Guardian, dismissed Kanazawa's claims as \"racist nonsense\". She also warned of growing concern over Psychology Today's position, at the time, regarding issue, also expressed by various academics and numerous public intellectuals,[9] among them the publication's own authors,[5] such as Mikhail Lyubansky, who criticized the publication, noting that \"extraordinary claims (especially those that hurt and damage marginalized groups) require extraordinary evidence and editorial oversight\".[32] Similarly, Christopher Ryan criticized Kanazawa's views and writings, calling him the \"Rush Limbaugh of Evolutionary Psychology\", noting that \"if Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, or Ann Coulter had studied science, they'd be penning articles like some of Kanazawa's.\"[33][34]/nA group of 68 evolutionary psychologists issued an open letter titled \"Kanazawa's bad science does not represent evolutionary psychology\" rejecting his views,[8] and an article on the same theme was published by 35 academics in American Psychologist.[9]", "70929609": "G.V.

Currently, Abouheif is trying to uncover the molecular mechanisms for the storage and release of ancestral genetic potentials in biological systems, and is working to harness these potentials to advance animal/plant breeding, medicine, and biodiversity conservation.[1]/nAbouheif has been awarded national and international awards: the Sloan Fellowship (USA; 2006), the Steacie Fellowship (Canada; 2014), the Guggenheim Fellowship (USA; 2017), and was elected as a Member of the Royal Society of Canada (2016), the College of New Artists, Scholars and Scientists,.[1][5] He served as founding President of the Pan-American Society for Evolutionary Developmental Biology,[2] as well as co-founder for the McGill Centre for Islam and Science.[1][3]/nHis most cited paper is \"The evolution of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes\",[6] cited 1027 times, according to Google Scholar.[7]", "4345051": "Saul Adler OBE FRS (Hebrew: \u05e9\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc \u05d0\u05d3\u05dc\u05e8; May 17, 1895 \u2013 January 25, 1966) was an Israeli expert on parasitology.[3]/nAdler was born in 1895 in Kerelits (Karelichy), then in the Russian Empire, now in Belarus. In 1900, he and his family moved to England and they settled in Leeds. He studied at University of Leeds and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine./nOne of his brothers was Solomon Adler, the economist./nFrom 1917 until 1920, Adler served in the Royal Army Medical Corps, attaining the rank of captain, serving in the Middle East, where he developed his first taste into research into tropical medicine, which he commenced studying after his military service, initially in Liverpool.[4] In 1921, Adler went to Sierra Leone to conduct research into Malaria./nIn 1924, Chaim Weizmann offered him a job in Jerusalem to develop the new Institute of Microbiology. Later that year, he emigrated to Mandate Palestine and started working in Hadassah Hospital, becoming director of the department of parasitology in 1927.

This led to the domestication of the Syrian hamster./nIn the 1940s he was a leader in developing a leishmaniasis vaccine using live parasites, a practice widespread in Israel and Russia until the 1980s, when large-scale clinical trials showed that the practice led to long-term skin lesions, exacerbation of psoriasis, and immunosuppression in some people.[5][6]/nSaul Adler died in Jerusalem on 25 January 1966.[citation needed] His funeral was attended by the President of Israel.", "4508893": "Joseph Adams FLS (1756 \u2013 20 June 1818) was a British physician and surgeon.[1]/nAdams was born in 1756 to Joseph Adams (c. 1725-1783), an apothecary of Basinghall Street, London, and Susannah, daughter of Timothy Rogers.[2] His father was a rigid dissenter who, because of his religious beliefs, would not allow his son to attend Oxford or Cambridge.[citation needed] He, however, received a good classical education and, having been apprenticed to his father, became a member of the Society of Apothecaries. He studied under Dr. Pitcairn and Mr. Pott at St Bartholomew\u2019s, Dr. Saunders at Guy's, and Mr. John Hunter at St. George's hospitals.[3]/nIn 1790, he became a member of the Corporation of Surgeons, and in 1795 published a small volume on Morbid Poisons. On the basis of that work, the University of Aberdeen awarded him an M.D. The following year, he left London for Madeira, where he resided for eight years, practising medicine and conducting research. He visited the lazaretto near Funchal, and learned about leprosy, yaws, and other diseases. This work contributed to the second edition of his work on Morbid Poisons, which he is principally known for. He has the merit of having introduced the cowpox into Madeira./nHe returned to England in 1805, and was admitted as an extra-licentiate (without examination) to the London Royal College of Physicians. When Dr. Woodville died in 1806, he succeeded him as physician at the Smallpox Hospital. At this time, the practice of vaccination was slowly recovering from numerous unfounded attacks. A general report authored under Adams' inspection and circulated by the committee of the hospital, helped remove alarm and inspire confidence. This, with a second report, was communicated to the College of Physicians, printed and circulated, and passed through thirteen editions. The produce of the sale was given to the hospital, with a net balance of cash, amounting to 1517l. 16s. 8d., being invested./nDr. Adams believed (erroneously) that cowpox and smallpox were the same disease. This opinion was shared by Dr. Edward Jenner. Dr. Adams drew his arguments in favour of their identity from the near resemblance of the most favourable kinds of smallpox to the cowpox, and presumptive proofs deduced from the laws of other morbid poisons, that the variolous and vaccine is the same. He contended that the character of the disease might change depending on the pustule used as a vaccine source, and that inoculations from cases of what he called pearl smallpox caused mild affections difficult to distinguish from those cowpox./nIn 1804, Adams received an inheritance that allowed him to indulge his taste for study, and also philanthropy.  His attachment to his profession was ardent.  He delivered several lecture courses, and edited the London Medical and Physical Journal for many years./nHe died on 20 June 1818, at the age of 62, following a compound fracture of the leg. He is buried in Bunhill Fields, with the simple motto, \"Vir Justus et bonus,\" inscribed on his tomb.[4] He was survived by his widow, Ann (1765/6\u20131838).[5]/nAdams has been described by science historians as a forgotten founder of medical genetics and the first clinical geneticist.[4][6] In 1814, he authored A Treatise on the Supposed Hereditary Properties of Diseases, based on years of clinical research. Adams was an early (albeit forgotten) anticipator of evolution. Anthropologist Kenneth M. Weiss has written:/nDarwin and Wallace were, to the best of my knowledge, wholly unaware of Adams, though in many ways he was ahead of them in time.

Chase, and Dan Backs spoke in support of the bill, although New Democrat Raj Pannu expressed concern that a provision that created unlimited liability corporations would flood Alberta with de facto American corporations that were registered in Alberta but did their business elsewhere.[12][13]  This bill was followed by the Business Corporations Amendment Act (No. 2), which provided protection for minority shareholders in the event that a corporation was converted to unlimited liability over opposition, and which clarified the period during which former shareholders in unlimited liability corporations remained liable.[14]  It passed with Liberal support, although Pannu expressed concern that the new protections were not sufficient.[14][15]  Also in 2005, Brown sponsored the Employment Pension Plans Amendment Act, which implemented uncontroversial changes to the regulation of private pensions and which received support from all parties.[16]/nBrown sponsored two government bills in 2006.[9]  The Persons with Developmental Disabilities Community Governance Amendment Act dissolved the Persons with Developmental Disabilities Provincial Board and transferred its authority to the Minister of Seniors and Community Supports, while expanding the authority of the six regional boards.[17]  MLAs from all parties, including Liberals Bharat Agnihotri, Hugh MacDonald, and Bridget Pastoor, Alberta Alliance leader Paul Hinman, and New Democrats Ray Martin, Brian Mason, and Raj Pannu, supported the bill.[17][18]  The Health Information Amendment Act made a number of changes to the conditions under which health information would be disclosed, including preventing the automatic reporting of private information to American authorities under the PATRIOT Act.[19]  New Democrats Pannu and David Eggen and Liberals Elsalhy, Pastoor, and Bruce Miller spoke in favour of the bill, although Liberal Laurie Blakeman expressed reservations that the content of the bill didn't reflect the recommendations of the legislature's special committee whose work led to the bill.[19][20][21]/nIn 2007, Brown sponsored one of the new Ed Stelmach government's flagship pieces of legislation, the Conflicts of Interest Amendment Act, which lengthened the cooling off period during which cabinet ministers and other high-ranking members of government to engage in certain activities after leaving the government's employment.[22][23]  It also placed a requirement on MLAs that they report any personal litigation in which they were engaged, and was supported by all parties.[24][25][26]  The same year he sponsored the Limitation Statutes Amendment Act, which was also supported by the opposition and which amended Alberta's statute of limitations for some civil matters.[27]\n[28]  Finally, Brown sponsored the Appeal Procedures Statutes Amendment Act.  This bill made some amendments to the procedures of the Alberta Court of Appeal.[29]  It was supported by Liberals Elsalhy and Maurice Tougas, but Pannu expressed some concern with a provision that would have made the keeping of transcripts of procedures discretionary.[29][30]/nBrown has made a number of notable contributions to the public sector; he served on the Board of Governors and Senate of The University of Calgary, was Past-president of the Alumni Association of The University of Calgary, and was member of Student Legal Aid at The University of Calgary.

Born in Montegiorgio, he was self-taught. He lived and worked at Livorno where he led an apothecary next to the port. He studied insects, animals, plants and drugs. Cestoni showed that scabies is caused by Sarcoptes scabiei./nCestoni was born in a poor household in Montegiorgio, region of Marche, to Vittorio and Settimia Cestoni. When Cestoni was 11, he left school and entered in the service of a local apothecary where he spent two years as an apprentice, preparing and selling medicines.[1]/nCestoni's time with the local apothecary in Montegiorgio piqued his interest towards natural sciences and in 1650 his family sent him to Rome, where he worked under Roman pharmacist Francesco Boncori. He lived and worked in Rome for the next few years./nIn 1656, Cestoni moved to the port city of Livorno where he started working in Francesco Salomoni's apothecary shop. After working in Salomoni's shop for a brief time period, Cestoni left Livorno and would spend the next several years traveling through different cities including Marseille and Lyon to Geneva, practicing and conducting research.[2]/nCestoni returned to Livorno in 1666, resuming administrative duties at his former employer Salomoni's store. He married Salomoni's wife's sister Margherita Tiburzi in 1668. Seven years into the marriage the couple had a son who died a few months after birth.[3]/nIn 1680, Cestoni became acquainted with physician Francesco Redi. The two became friends and began a lively correspondence, which is known chiefly through Redi's letters./nThe scientific correspondence between the two researchers lasted years until the death of Redi in 1697. Influenced by Redi, Cestoni furthered his research and would often ask his friends for advice./nAfter Redi's death, Cestoni began to write letters to Antonio Vallisnieri discussing his scientific observations. The two exchanged 583 letters over the next twenty years. Most of Cestoni's research observations recorded in these letters were made before 1697. Vallisnieri published part of Cestoni's observations, inserting them into his own works or into journals such as the Galleria di Minerva and the Giornale de\u2019 letterati d\u2019Italia. Among the few observations published abroad were those on the metamorphic cycle of the flea which appeared in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.[4]/nCestoni died on January 29, 1718. He was suffering from bladder stones and urethral stenosis./nCestoni was self taught. He had no academic qualifications and started making observations at a young age and although he never had a proper education most of what he learned was through his own observations and through collaborating with others including Francesco Redi and Antonio Vallisnieri. He composed several works on natural history. Most of his research was printed in the works of his friend Vallisnieri./nCestoni's had an interest in plants and herbs, analyzing drugs and their medicinal effects. The pharmacological aspect was extensively treated by Cestoni, who among other things was always very attentive to the different opinions on the use of medicines. As an apothecary he studied different contagious diseases and carried out treatment trials using different drugs.[5] The method followed by Cestoni for medicines was through trial and testing, and observing on their effectiveness. Since Cestoni was not a doctor he heavily relied on consulting his friend Redi for many of his medical trials.[6]/nEvidence of his main pharmacological studies are found in his letters to Redi and other friends and colleagues. In these letters, Cestoni recorded observations of many plants including sarsaparilla and Cinchona./nCestoni's research on cinchona was important at the time. He was able to devise a safe treating mechanism using cinchona which he shared with his friend Vallisnieri in letters. He made some recommendations regarding cinchona. Cestoni wrote about its effectiveness in powdered form and the dosage and methodology of consuming the drug./nIn his correspondences with his friend, Cestoni also wrote about his observations and experiments with Sarsaparilla. Cestoni examined the sarsaparilla, a plant whose roots are used to make medicine, also historically used in treating syphilis. Cestoni was able to prepare a decoction and also provided information on the method and the exact dose of administration.[7]/nCestoni also studied the effects of foods and drinks such as chocolate, coffee and lemongrass. Cestoni believed that chocolate consumption should be balanced. He called it nutritious but bad for the stomach if consumed in large quantities. In his letters, Cestoni indicates that he did not consider chocolate a medicine, but a tasty food that's hard to digest and therefore whoever consumes it in small quantities will be healthy. He recommended health compromised individuals not to take it./nHis main research area was observing insect reproduction, and through his observation with a microscope he eventually discovered the viviparity and parthenogenesis of aphids./nAmong one of his letters sent to Vallisneri on August 19, 1697, he revealed that he had observed flea's eggs and that from these eggs \"lactated white bacherelli\" were born which, after two weeks, grew and made a silk thread come out of their mouth. which was used for the construction of the cocoon; the flea grew inside the cocoon and formed completely before exiting. He also observed other insect species including green grasshoppers, scorpions, woodworms, cabbage insects, worms and studied insect galls and discovered galls on oak trees were caused by flies./nHe also studied the coral and his investigations on coral are found in a study made by G. De Toni. who stated in 1723 that Cestoni had asserted that the coral was nothing but \"an insect similar to a small sea oyster or octopus.\"/nCestoni also studied seaweed, in particular the Posidonia oceanica. He proved that the seaweed possessed seeds and fruits like any other plant. Cestoni was the first to show flowers and fruits of the seaweed, and was the first who observed that sea balls were an aggregate of the fibers of the seaweed conglomerated by the sea waves./nAmong microorganisms, Cestoni studied infusoria in water and also significantly studied vinegar eels (Anguillula vinegar), which are found in unfiltered vinegar./nIn some of his letters addressed to Redi, Cestoni discussed with his friend about stones in the stomach of birds and grafts. He correctly deduced that the stones actually helped the birds in digestion. Cestoni experimented with grafting and attempted to transplant the spur of a chicken onto the head of a rooster./nPerhaps his most notable work was on the research he did on scabies. He collaborated with a physician from Livorno who was a disciple of Redi, Giovan Cosimo Bonomo. Cestoni and Bonomo described the life history of the itch mite, Sarcoptes Scabiei that causes scabies. Cestoni helped in discovering the link of the mite with scabies. He observed the mite under a microscope uncovering details about the mite's life history, means of infection, and effective vs ineffective treatments. These conclusions were controversial in his day, and opposed by prominent physicians such as Giovanni Maria Lancisi, the Pope's chief physician in Rome, since the established belief was that scabies was caused by an excess of black humour (melaina col\u00e8).[8] Cestoni shared his findings with Redi in one of his letters he sent in 1687.[9] Cestoni published six illustrations of the life cycle and discussed the means of transmission to new hosts. Cestoni also wrote to Vallisnieri in 1710 that he, not Bonomo, had discovered that scabies was caused by a mite./nCestoni was interested in studying animals. He studied invertebrates such as arthropods, molluscs, worms and vertebrates. He studied eels, \"vinegar eels\", \"worms\" and caterpillars, barnacles, cockroaches, ship mists (lamellibranch mollusc known today as teredine), ants, earthworms, praying mantis, millipedes (myriapods), flies, oysters, fish, lice, bat, green lizard, frog, sea urchin, swallows, toads, salamander, scarab, scolopendra, \"flying beetle\", \"water scorpion\", sponges, woodworms, turtle, tapeworms, tarantulas, wasps, vipers, mosquito, ticks, zoophytes./nHe significantly studied chameleons and his keen interest in it can be seen in the letters he exchanged with his friends. His work on chameleons was also published in his friend Vallisnieri's work \"Istoria del Camaleonte affricano, e di varj animali d'Italia\"./nThrough systematic direct observations he had managed to draw a precise picture of the animal's habits. He was able to disprove the myth at the time about chameleons that they do not eat and drink and just lived on air. He observed their eating habits and found out that they eat insects including crickets, grasshoppers, butterflies, spiders, white snails, lizards, winged ants. Though he spent a lot of time observing the chameleon he was not able to provide an explanation for the shift in its colors. Vallisneri's research on chameleons was significantly based on observations of Cestoni.[10]/nMost of Cestino's work was published in the works of his friend Vallisnieri. All of his composed work is in Italian.", "66571507": "Aniruddh (Ani) D. Patel is a cognitive psychologist known for his research on music cognition and the cognitive neuroscience of music.[1]  He is Professor of Psychology at Tufts University, Massachusetts. From a background in evolutionary biology, his work includes empirical research, theoretical studies, brain imaging techniques, and acoustical analysis applied to areas such as cognitive musicology (how humans process music), parallel relationships between music and language, and evolutionary musicology (cross-species comparisons).[2] Patel received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2018 to support his work on the evolution of musical cognition.[1]/nPatel received the Deems Taylor Award[3] from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, and the Music Has Power Award from the Institute for Music and Neurologic Function[4] for his 2008 book, Music, Language and the Brain.[5] Oliver Sacks considered Music, Language, and the Brain  \"a major synthesis that will be indispensable to neuroscientists.\"[6] Josh McDermott, head of MIT's Laboratory for Computational Audition, found Patel's focus on the syntax of music and language with its potential for revelations into similarities in their underlying mechanical operations especially significant.[7] Ray Jackendoff, co-author with Fred Lerdahl of A Generative Theory of Tonal Music, suggested a cautious approach in distinguishing parallels between music and language without accounting for other cognitive domains that may share such capacities.[8]/nPatel received his B.A. in biology from the University of Virginia in 1987.  He attended graduate school at Harvard University where he earned an MA  and subsequently a PhD  in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology in 1996.[6][9]  In a New York Times interview, Patel explained that from childhood his passions had always been science and music.[6] In college, he concentrated mostly on cell biology until his senior year, when his interest was ignited by courses in animal behavior and evolution, and he thought he might study music as a biologist.[9]  Patel's Harvard graduate studies took place under Edward O. Wilson's supervision. Before he found his footing and established the direction of his future research, he acquired laboratory and fieldwork experience in ant behavior both in Wilson's laboratory and in the Australian outback.[9] His thesis,  A Biological Study of the Relationship Between Language and Music, was mentored by Wilson and Evan Balaban. Patel also obtained support from speech and language researchers and specialists at other institutions.[6][9]/nFollowing graduate school, Patel joined The Neurosciences Institute in San Diego, CA, under the direction of Gerald Edelman.[10] In 2005, he was appointed the Esther J. Burnham Senior Fellow, and he remained at the Institute until 2012 when he joined Tufts University as an associate professor in the Department of Psychology.  At Tufts, he is a participating member of the Stibel Dennett Consortium, a faculty group that encourages teaching initiatives and scholarship relating to the brain and cognition.[11] In addition to research and academic activities, Patel is being active in a number of related organizations. From 2009 to 2011, he was president of the Society for Music Perception and Cognition (SMPC),  an organization dedicated to the study of musical cognition.[12]/nPatel is a Fellow at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR), a global research organization that recognizes and supports international, innovative, high-impact research.[13] He was named a Fellow of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies (Social Sciences) for 2018-2019[14][13] and was a visiting scholar in the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University.[15]/nSince Patel's initial research forays into the neuroscience of music, the field has gained definition and expanded both by the number of disciplines conducting research in the area and the intensity of attention paid to certain topics. He remains focused on the areas outlined in Music, Language, and the Brain: sound elements: pitch and timbre; rhythm; syntax; meaning; and evolution.[5] Patel finds greater parallels in the mechanical/syntactical structural elements than in the semantics (meaning, content) of music and language. His work takes advantage of advances in neuroscience that enable the mapping of parallel processing of brain activity in music and language applications. For example, he found additional support for his shared syntactic integration resource hypothesis in  a 2003 study that explored the idea that the syntactical elements of both music and language draw upon the same area, one that provides limited processing resources.[16] This was seen as an opportunity to further explore the brain's processing abilities with regard to hierarchical, syntactical structures.[16]/nA 2018 collaboration between Ola Ozernov-Palchik and Patel[17] examines rhythmic processing in music to see if beat-based musical processing may have any effect on reading abilities and, if so, what significance this may have on the reading abilities of young children. Patel's OPERA hypothesis suggests that adaptive plasticity for specific neural areas beneficial to speech processing can be derived from musical training when five conditions are met:  O - Overlap; P - Precision; E - Emotion; R - Repetition; and A - Attention. A drop-down effect is suggested from the greater precision demanded by musical training to the language acquisition areas shared by the neural networks. Thus it may be possible to discover ways in which musical training can be used to enhance language skills.[18][19] A continuing interest is the exploration of stress patterns in spoken languages and the potential parallels with music composed by native speakers of those languages.[20] (See Video Appearances.)/nWith John Iversen and others, Patel has explored how brain mechanisms perceive and process rhythm as well as the relationship of music and language processing.[21][22][23] A 2021 study with J.J. Cannon focuses on how beat anticipation is neurally implemented by processes occurring in the supplementary motor area and the dorsal striatum.[24]/nA significant area of interest for Patel concerns communications among and across species, and the evolutionary roots of human language and music. His search for the origins of rhythm (beat) and melody have led to  explorations of the vocal and rhythmic behavior of monkeys, birds, and parrots.[25][26][27] After failing to find anticipated rhythmic correlational correspondences in chimpanzees, Patel was surprised to learn about Snowball, a cockatoo with a fine sense of rhythm.  By 2019, he had not only studied the cockatoo's timing but also the creativity involved in its various moves.[28]/nPatel shares his research with audiences across many different venues, and a number of video  appearances are available on YouTube.  In 2008, at the Library of Congress, he spoke about \"The Music of Language and the Language of Music.\"[29] At the 2015 Conference of Chorus America, he shared research on how brain function may be positively affected through singing.[30] In January, 2017, he appeared on a panel with experts gathered by the National Institutes of Health and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to discuss current research on music and the brain and its implications for human health.[31] In 2017 at Columbia University, Patel presented results from research seeking cross-species competencies in three areas common to human perception: a) ability to recognize transposed melodies or pitch patterns, b) ability to predict beats, and c) ability to respond emotionally to music.[32] A major outreach initiative for people interested in the field is his 18-part program \"Music and the Brain\" for Great Courses.[33]/nAn especially informative video episode is part of a MathScienceMusic series from New York University.[34]  Patel provides the Normalized Pairwise Variability Index (nPVI) equation long used by linguists to compare patterns in speech. After establishing stylistic contrasts in stress patterns in French and English spoken language, he applies the formula to musical compositions by native composers of both countries. While strong contrasts are found in the language examples, similar although weaker contrasts are found in the musical excerpts.

He attended Aberdeen Grammar School and then Aberdeen University from where he graduated with an M.A. in 1908. In 1911 he attained a BSc and became Zoologist to the Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory, Edinburgh, a post he held until he was appointed naturalist to the Marine Biological Association in 1913. While at the Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory, he worked on some of the Antarctic specimens that William Speirs Bruce had brought back from the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of 1902\u201304./nHe was a natural sportsman, a keen golfer and angler, and was selected to play cricket for Scotland in 1912.[2] He had a reserved manner, not given to laughing or joking,[citation needed] but with a strong work ethic and a passion for biology./nOn 9 August 1914 the Endurance departed Plymouth, carrying Shackleton and his crew on what was intended to be the first expedition to cross Antarctica from the Atlantic to the Pacific via the South Pole. Over 5000 applications for places in the crew had been received. The expedition was a failure: the ship became trapped in pack ice and was eventually destroyed by the pressure of the ice, but all the crew of the Endurance were eventually rescued after Shackleton and five men made an 800-mile sea journey to fetch help.\nClark was a hard worker, and, despite his dour manner, quickly won the respect of the crew with his willingness to volunteer for some of the more arduous or unpleasant jobs aboard ship, although he was the butt of several jokes. He was not the politest of men, and a little verse was composed around his apparent inability to remember to say \"please\". The crew boiled some spaghetti and placed it in one of his collecting jars, causing him momentary excitement at the thought of having discovered a new species, and a standing joke claimed the penguins seen alongside were said to shout out \"Clark, Clark\" and chase after the ship whenever he was at the wheel. He worked arduously at his biological recording from the moment the expeditions set out, recording the specimens encountered using dredging nets as the ship progressed southwards. When the ship became trapped in the ice he continued with his work, dissecting penguins and recording the changes in the plankton levels in sea./nWhen the ship had to be abandoned all Clark's specimens were left behind. Frank Worsley recorded:/nI felt sorry for Clark, as I lay there that night and realised that he had been obliged to leave on the Endurance the whole of his valuable collection that he had been at such pains to classify and study./nOnce they reached the edge of the pack ice the crew set out for Elephant Island in three of the small boats of the Endurance. Clark travelled in the 22\u00bd-foot James Caird with Shackleton, Frank Hurley, Leonard Hussey, Reginald James, James Wordie, Harry McNish, Charles Green, John Vincent and Timothy McCarthy. On arriving at the island, Shackleton set out almost immediately with five of the crew to fetch rescue from South Georgia. The rest of the men, Clark among them, stayed camped on the island with Frank Wild in command. Elephant Island was inhospitable. It was cold but humid which meant that neither the clothing nor the sleeping bags were ever completely dry. Though there were penguins and seals to eat, the supplies were not inexhaustible and fuel was scarce. The routine on the island was monotonous. Clark managed to produce a primitive alcoholic beverage from methylated spirit, sugar, water and ginger which became known as \"Gut Rot 1916\" and was drunk with a toast to \"Wives and Sweethearts\" on Saturdays. On 30 August 1916, the men on Elephant Island were rescued by Shackleton aboard the Chilean ship Yelcho, four months after he had left the island./nClark returned to Scotland where he married Christine Ferguson. He served as a Lieutenant on minesweepers in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve during World War I and then returned to Plymouth in 1919 when the war finished. His cricketing skills led to his again being selected for Scotland in 1924. In 1925 he gained a D.Sc. (Doctor of Science), and in the same year he became the director of the Fisheries Research Laboratory in Torry, Aberdeen. In 1934, he was appointed Superintendent of Scientific Investigations under the Fishery Board for Scotland.

Freese was also the Director of the Basic Neurosciences Program at NINDS from 1987./nFreese was interested in the molecular mechanism of mutations and determined the difference between spontaneous and chemical mutations by using T4 phage. In 1959 he coined the terms \"transitions\" and \"transversions\" to categorize different types of point mutations.[2][3] Point mutations, often caused by chemicals or malfunction of DNA replication, exchange a single nucleotide for another. Most common is the transition that exchanges a purine for a purine (A \u2194 G) or a pyrimidine for a pyrimidine, (C \u2194 T)./nFreese's research also included microbial differentiation and molecular neurobiology. He studied the effect of lipophilic acids on the growth and differentiation of bacteria.  Freese's laboratory worked on the metabolic control of sporulation and germination of Bacillus subtilis bacteria.  He identified the key metabolite for ignition of sporulation: a decrease of GTP.   Freese was cofounder of the Environmental Mutagen Society and served as its president for two years. In 1971, he organized the first comprehensive conference focused on the prospects of gene therapy through the John E. Fogarty International Center.[4] His laboratory identified certain compounds as mutagenic and he was instrumental in banning the use of certain pesticides and food additives. Later in his career, as a NIH administrator, he provided the initial support to J.

An early engagement in the social and political consequences of his own discipline, biochemistry, led him in the 1970s to take up studies of the technological, ecological and historical dimensions of science. The results of these investigations can be found in his 1982 book Samfundets naturhistorie (The Natural History of Society).[2]/nAt the same time, Hoffmeyer also embarked upon a parallel track of inquiry, based on a growing awareness that the reductionist tendencies of modern biology and science systematically legitimized and guided the technological horizon towards developments that were inherently damaging to natural systems, including that of human health. This inquiry led him towards questions of theoretical biology and philosophy. Eventually these two research tracks ran together, when, in a collaboration with Claus Emmeche, he initiated an analysis of the concepts of information in both its bio-ontological dimension, as well as in its applied contexts dealing with biological (e.g. genetic) and cultural information, and the then-upcoming 'smart' information and biotechnologies[3]/nHoffmeyer traced much of the development of his thinking during this period to the semiotic traditions of the late 1980s, as well as to such scientific systems theorists as Gregory Bateson, Michael Polanyi, Anthony Wilden, Howard H. Pattee and Peder Voetmann Christiansen. Eventually making the acquaintance of Thomas Sebeok in the United States, Thure von Uexk\u00fcll in Germany and Kalevi Kull in Estonia, by the beginning of the 1990s, Hoffmeyer had formulated a new programme for a scientific biology that would define life as a signbased phenomenon. Hoffmeyer's first comprehensive essay outlining this of biosemiotics and its implication for a non-dualist understanding of the embodied self was his Signs of Meaning in the Universe (in Danish, En snegl p\u00e5 vejen, 1993).[4]/nBeginning in 2001, when the yearly annual international \u2018Gatherings in Biosemiotics\u2019 conferences began, Hoffmeyer became a central figure in establishing biosemiotics as a scientific cross-disciplinary field, assembling scientists and humanities scholars to jointly investigate how a semiotic analysis can inform current biological thinking, and how the findings of biology provide general semiotics with a firmer ground for the naturalization of 'meaning'.[5]/nIn 2005, Hoffmeyer was conferred with a Danish doctoral degree for his treatise Biosemiotics: An Examination into the Signs of Life and the Life of Signs. Translated into an English-language edition in 2008, this work examines the semiotics of living nature, from the origin of life with its self-organizing code-duality in evolution and development, to the complex endosemiosis of living bodies, to the \u2018semiotic niches\u2019 in ecosystems, and the species-specific peculiarities of human semiosis, such as language./nSemiotic freedom.

Broyde earned her Bachelor's degree at the College of the City of New York (CCNY), which has been termed \u201cThe Harvard of the poor.\u201d,[1] from which she graduated Phi Beta Kappa and Magna cum Laude, with honors in the Chemistry major. From there Broyde entered the PhD program in Chemistry at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (Brooklyn Poly, now NYU Tandon), where she majored in Physical Chemistry with a minor in Physics; her thesis, in the laboratory of Gerald Oster, investigated the photochemistry and spectroscopy of chlorophylls to elucidate the biophysical basis of photosynthesis. Subsequently she was a Research Scientist at IBM Watson Labs at Columbia University where the work on chlorophylls continued with Biophysicist Seymour Stephen Brody, subsequently recruited by NYU Biology to initiate a Biophysics program focusing on plants and photosynthesis; Broyde joined him in establishing the lab and mentoring students and postdocs. Her first child, Dr. Linda Broyde Haramati (Yale School of Medicine, Professor of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging and Chief Mentoring Officer) was born while she was a graduate student and her second child, Michael Broyde, Professor of Law, Emory University School of Law and Director, Doctor of Judicial Science Degree, was born while she was at IBM. Subsequently Broyde was at Princeton University in the laboratory of Robert Langridge where she was introduced to the then infant field of molecular modeling, and focusing on nucleic acid structure. She pursued her study of nucleic acid structure by computer modelling and received her first NIH grant while at the School of Physics, Georgia Institute of Technology./nBroyde returned to New York University as Research Associate Professor in the Biology Department and became Full Professor with tenure in 1987; at NYU she formed collaborations with Chemistry Department colleagues Robert Shapiro (deceased 2011) and Nicholas Geacintov, who had strong interests in the structure and function of DNA that is damaged by carcinogens, such as those present in tobacco smoke or induced by the ultraviolet light in the sun, using experimental approaches. How such lesions in DNA can be repaired, but can also generate mutations during replication that start the carcinogenic process has been the focus of Broyde's research. Broyde's expertise in computationally addressing this structure-function relationship formed the basis of her research trajectory which has been continuously funded by the NIH. She is author of over 200 published works, as well as the Wiley book The Chemical Biology of DNA Damage with Nicholas Geacintov. Broyde also has a very full teaching docket, focusing on upper level undergraduates with a pre-health concentration and an interest in drug design, as well as literature reading and fundamental biological topics for graduate students.

This vaccine did not develop agglutinating antibodies. This property made it possible to distinguish infected animals (carriers of agglutinating antibodies) from vaccinated animals (not carriers of this type of antibody) and thus to facilitate disease prophylaxis. This type of vaccine also confirmed the essentially cellular nature of brucella immunity and the passive role of antibodies./nThe diagnosis of chronic human brucellosis is made difficult by the serological silence that is most often observed in this phase of the disease. Given the essentially cellular nature of brucella immunity, Charles Pilet and his team proposed replacing the traditional serodiagnosis with a cellular test. This new diagnostic possibility led the microbiology laboratory at the \u00c9cole d'Alfort to receive numerous requests for examinations from Parisian hospitals at the time./nThe study of several mouse lines showed the sensitivity of some of these lines to Brucella abortus, which made it possible to propose a new method for controlling brucella vaccines, a method that has since been adopted internationally./nThe dogma of the time that the newborn animal or human being was tolerant to a foreign substance was in fact only partially accurate. Work on immune tolerance had previously been conducted with soluble antigens. Using a particulate antigen extracted from Brucella, Charles Pilet and his team showed that in this case, the newborn mouse could respond very early to antigenic solicitation. This lack of immune tolerance is probably due to the non-specific activity of Brucella's particulate extracts on the maturation of the immune system, which becomes able to respond to specific antigenic stimulation much earlier by a classical immune response./nThis observation relating to immune tolerance, as well as a clinical observation, led to a new direction in Charles Pilet's work. It had been noted that the injection of Mycobacterium chelonae (tubercular bacillus isolated from turtles) into animals significantly increased their resistance to infections.  The isolation of the active ingredient of this bacterium, entrusted to Tsehay Neway, made it possible to isolate a polar glycopeptidolipid (GPLP).  This substance has shown significant activity on immune cells. This immunostimulant acting on bone marrow stem cells was also a true hematopoietic growth factor and was able to correct immunosuppression in mice caused by cancer chemotherapy.

Within a few hours, it was announced that Beckerle would be reinstated as CEO and Director of the Huntsman Cancer Institute, and would report directly to the University President, bypassing Vivian Lee.[16] On 28 April, Vivian Lee announced via email that, effective the same day, she was stepping down as the university's senior vice president for health sciences, dean of the medical school, and CEO of the healthcare system.[17][18]/nBeckerle's research employs several different techniques to exam signaling problems and cell motility issues. Ewing's Sarcoma is a bone cancer affecting mainly children and adolescents.[19] Tumors of Ewing' Sarcoma are typically found in the long bones of the legs and arms, or bones in the chest, trunk, pelvis, back, or head.[20] Beckerle's research in this area focuses on a key pathway as believed to be a mechanism by which the cancer cells can spread. Ewing sarcoma occurs due to a chromosomal mutation that causes an atypical protein, known as EWS/FLI, to be present (also called expressed), and that when EWS/FLI is expressed, literally thousands of genes are misregulated, leading to abnormal behavior. Beckerle's lab found that the EWS/FLI protein disrupted cell adhesion and limited the ability of cells to remain in their normal environment. The EWS/FLI protein is difficult to regulate so Beckerle's team is focused on an essential regulating protein called lysine specific demethylase (LSD1). Preliminary research has aimed to halt the function of LSD1 to prevent the spread of Ewing Sarcoma cells.[1]", "51793341": "Prafullachandra Vishnu Sane (born 1937) is an Indian molecular biologist and plant physiologist, known for his pioneering studies on photosynthesis.[1][2] He is a former director of National Botanical Research Institute[3] and an elected fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences, Indian National Science Academy, National Academy of Sciences, India, National Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the Maharashtra Academy of Sciences.[4] The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 1981, for his contributions to biological sciences.[5]/nPrafullachandra Vishnu Sane, born on the Christmas Eve of 1937 at Chiplun, in Ratnagiri district in the Indian state of Maharashtra to Vishnu Jagannath Sane and Indira, did his schooling at New English High School, Nagpur and college studies at Agriculture College of Dr. Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth from where he graduated in 1958.[6] After obtaining his master's degree in agriculture from Nagpur University in 1960, he started his career at Bureau of Indian Standards in 1961 and continued there till 1964 when he moved to the University of Alberta, Edmonton for his doctoral studies to secure a PhD in 1968.[4] He stayed in the North America for three more years, working at the University of California, Berkeley as an assistant research botanist and returned to India to join the Agricultural Biochemistry Section of Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC) as its head in 1972 where he worked till 1984.

There, he pursued his interests in ecology by performing research under the supervision of Ted Brown[1] on the environmental adaptation of cyanobacteria. Carthew continued his studies at University of Toronto, where he received a M.Sc. degree in botany with Johann Hellebust. At the same time, he pursued training in music composition at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto./nUpon completion of his degree, Carthew worked for two years as a research technician under the supervision of Jack Greenblatt at the Banting and Best Department of Medical Research in Toronto. In this time, Carthew studied the biochemistry of eukaryotic gene transcription and decided to forgo a career in music for one in the biomedical sciences. In 1982, Carthew began his PhD studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he performed his thesis research in the lab of Phillip A. Sharp. During his doctoral career, Carthew transformed the Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay or EMSA into an assay that could detect sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins from crude cell extracts.[2] Using this method, he identified and studied the HeLa cell transcription factor USF and its role in regulating gene transcription.[3][4] Carthew also played a role in popularizing the now-common use in the biomedical literature of having multiple authors of a paper as \"co-first authors\". Carthew and fellow graduate student Lewis Chodosh decided to adopt this mechanism for their joint publication[2] in Cell, inspired by its use by Andrew Fire and Mark Samuels.[5] This novel feature of their paper was noticed by many, and subsequently adopted in other papers./nFollowing his graduate work, Carthew pursued post-doctoral research at the University of California Berkeley as a Helen Hay Whitney fellow. Carthew worked under the direction of Gerald M. Rubin on the molecular mechanisms of compound eye development in Drosophila melanogaster. He showed that the RING finger domain protein Seven in Absentia is essential for multipotent eye cells to adopt an R7 photoreceptor cell fate.[6] In subsequent work, he showed that Seven in Absentia is activated by the Ras signal transduction pathway and acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to rapidly degrade a transcriptional repressor of R7 cell differentiation.[7][8]/nCarthew started his independent research group in 1992 at the University of Pittsburgh in the Department of Biological Sciences. He became a tenured associate professor in 1998 and full professor in 2001. In 2001, Carthew moved to Northwestern University and became a full professor in the Department of Molecular Biosciences, which is located on the Evanston campus. He was appointed the Owen L. Coon Professor of Molecular Biology in 2006. Carthew served as leader of the Chromatin and Nuclear Dynamics Program in Northwestern\u2019s Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center from 2012 to 2018. He served as director of the NCI funded Oncogenesis and Developmental Biology Training Program from 2007-2014. He currently serves as director of the NIGMS funded Training Program in Cellular and Molecular Basis of Disease at Northwestern./nIn the early phase of Carthew lab research, a number of firsts were achieved. The Carthew group was the first to establish the Drosophila eye as a model system to study planar cell polarity.[9] It was the first group to use Drosophila as a disease model to screen and test small molecule drugs for potential efficacy in disease treatment.[10] It was the first group to provide genetic evidence that Frizzled proteins were Wnt receptors in vivo.[11][12] In 1998, the group discovered that Drosophila were capable of RNAi or RNA interference.[12] The labs of Andrew Fire and Craig Mello had just demonstrated a key role for double-stranded RNA as the trigger for RNAi in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans,[13] a discovery culminating in a Nobel Prize for Fire and Mello in 2006. By showing that RNAi also existed in another animal species, the Carthew group stimulated the search for RNAi in mammals, as well as the adoption of Drosophila as a premier model to study the biochemical and genetic mechanisms of RNAi. The Carthew group also developed the first and second generations of transgene systems for performing RNAi against any Drosophila gene at any stage of the life cycle in a tissue- or cell-specific manner.[14][15] The second generation system was later expanded into a genome-wide collection of transgenic lines targeting all annotated genes.[16] The Carthew lab has continued pursuing the mechanisms and functions of the small non-coding RNA world that was first glimpsed through the lens of RNAi. The group has been addressing how and why small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression./nSince 2004, the Carthew group has also pursued questions related to quantitative issues of development. Inspired by the mathematical biologist D'Arcy Thompson and his seminal book On Growth and Form, the group showed that the topology of epithelial cells in the Drosophila eye is constrained due to a tendency for the cells to minimize surface energy.[17] This pioneering work emerged at the same time as other groups around the world also began addressing physical aspects of morphogenesis. Recent work in the Carthew lab has turned to dynamical features of gene expression as cells undergo lineage restriction during development.[18] This work has focused on the importance of time as a dimension in animal development and how gene regulatory networks are designed to provide temporal flexibility to development. The Carthew group found that when developmental tempo is slowed down by limiting cell metabolism, gene repressors become redundant during lineage restriction, and the entire microRNA family is rendered non-essential for development in general.[19]/nIn July 2018, Carthew became Director of the newly founded NSF-Simons Center for Quantitative Biology at Northwestern University. Co-funded by a public-private partnership between the National Science Foundation and Simons Foundation, the Center for Quantitative Biology contains 12 Northwestern faculty members who are experts in developmental biology, applied mathematics, and pure mathematics. The Center's mission is to greatly expand the application of mathematics to study of important questions in developmental biology.

Presumably he has some sort of psionic ability that enables him to do this. He has a deep hatred of the Thing, who is romantically interested in his stepdaughter, Alicia Masters. He once tried to take over the world but was thwarted in this effort by the Fantastic Four./nThe Puppet Master's first appearance was in Fantastic Four #8 (November 1962), and he was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.[1] His last name, Masters, was revealed in the letters page of Fantastic Four #42 (Sept. 1965), as suggested by a reader, who was given a No-Prize for her service to Marvel.[2] The Puppet Master's origin is told in Marvel Team-Up #6 (January 1973)./nPhilip Masters, the man who becomes the Puppet Master, was born in Dragorin, a town in the small fictional Balkan nation of Transia. He moved to the United States at the age of eight. Growing up he was socially maladjusted and had no friends. (According to Spider-Man Family #4, his mother died when he was young and he was often picked on, which caused him to turn to his puppets for \"friendship\".)/nAfter he finished college he went into business with Jacob Reiss. Philip was jealous of Reiss' wealth and of his family and decided to sabotage his workplace, but Reiss caught him in the act. The two of them break into a fight which results in an explosion that kills Reiss and blinds his daughter Alicia, who was also caught in the blast./nPhillip plays the explosion off as an accident, and then starts a relationship Reiss' wife, Marcia. He marries Marcia and adopts Alicia. Later, Marcia dies and it is more than he can bear and he loses his sanity. He begins experimenting with the radioactive clay puppets that he uses to control specific individuals' bodies.[3] When the Human Torch interferes with one of his experiments, he sets about bringing down the Fantastic Four. He captures the Invisible Girl and the Thing, and masterminds a mass jailbreak using the warden's trustee. He then falls through a window to his death after tripping over Alicia's hand.[4][5]/nThough his fatal fall is alluded to in his subsequent appearance, it is never explained how he is still alive. He has himself committed to a sanitorium for several months in the belief that this will allow the world to forget him. Upon release he takes control of Namor and uses him to battle the Fantastic Four.[6] He also pits the Human Torch and the Thing against each other.[7] He teams up with the Mad Thinker and uses the original X-Men to battle the Fantastic Four.[8] Teaming up again with the Thinker, who would become his frequent ally, he battles the Thing and the Torch again,[9] using animated life-size mannequins to battle the pair.[10]/nThe Puppet Master is later seen among a group of criminals assembled by Doctor Doom.[11] He then controls Namor again.[12] He opposes the original X-Men through the mind-controlled Mimic.[13] He also sparks a battle between the Hulk and Namor by controlling the Hulk.[14]/nThe Puppet Master next allies with the Mad Thinker and Egghead in their attempt to blackmail the U.S. He forces Iron Man to battle Captain Marvel.[15] He again teams with the Thinker, and attacks the Fantastic Four using androids of their past foes.[16] He controls Ballox the Monstroid, and battles Spider-Man and the Vision.[17][18] With the Thinker, he battles Spider-Man and the Thing.[19] He then forces Thor to battle the Fantastic Four.[20] He then controls the Wrecker and Power Man.[21] Eventually, the Puppet Master returns to his homeland, where he encounters Modred the Mystic.[22]/nWith Doctor Doom, the Puppet Master traps the Fantastic Four within the miniature artificial city of \"Liddleville\", their minds trapped inside tiny cybernetic, part-organic copies of their original bodies. However, Doom perverts what had been intended by the Puppet Master as a chance to give Alicia and Ben a normal life into a trap, and he eventually helps the Fantastic Four learn the truth and escape Liddleville while trapping Doom in the android body he had used to monitor the Fantastic Four.[23] He is defeated by Doom in Liddleville [24] and seemed to have been destroyed,[25] but his mind is then resurrected in a body of living radioactive clay.[26] He battles the Thing on the mental plane, and his physical clay body is destroyed.[27] He is eventually resurrected in his original body by the Sphinx.[28]/nHe was once thought to have been killed when he fell out of the window of a fairly tall building, but miraculously survived.[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed] The Puppet Master has exhibited an uncanny ability to cheat death, dodging mortal threats that have included bomb blasts,[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed] drownings,[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed] and even a giant squid attack.[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed] Liddleville would later be used against the Micronauts and X-Force.[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed]/nThe jealous Puppet Master often uses his clay to manipulate the lives of the Fantastic Four, especially where his stepdaughter was concerned. He is particularly concerned with guarding his precious Alicia from marrying the likes of the Thing.[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed] But he is later just as outraged when she is engaged to Johnny Storm, also a member of the Fantastic Four.[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed]/nWith the Thinker and the Wizard, Masters attempts to disrupt the wedding of the Human Torch and Alicia. The plan was to launch an attack on the church after the wedding ceremony, but when he sees how happy Alicia is to marry Johnny, Masters is overcome with remorse and turns on his associates, launching the Dragon Man against them: his wedding gift to Alicia and Johnny.[29]/nLater, Masters is reformed, remarried, and has a stepson; the toys he crafts for his son inadvertently caused a battle between Power Pack and the alien Ciegramites.[30] He reveals to the Thing that he had discovered that the Alicia Johnny had married was actually a Skrull.[31]/nThe Puppet Master has been shown on two occasions attempting to leave his (overtly) criminal life behind. In the first, he found some measure of spiritual enlightenment in the service of the billionaire philosopher/cultist Satori. Satori employs Masters to construct a \"perfect man\" from his clay, which would then receive life and the power cosmic from the Silver Surfer and absorb Satori's mind, so that he might survive his body's death and serve as a proper leader to his flock.[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed] Masters at some point left this cult, and entered a S.H.I.E.L.D.-maintained witness protection program, using his abilities to aid the government through the dulling of memories of other so-protected criminals' previous associates. Masters reached out through his powers to control Ben Grimm and Alicia, duping Ben into a \"married life\" with his despondent daughter, whom Ben had stopped seeing years before. Ben was freed, but the Fantastic Four were prevented from taking any measure of revenge upon Masters, given his S.H.I.E.L.D. affiliation.[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed]/nThe Puppet Master returned to criminal life and affiliated himself with the Mad Thinker. Utilizing a device constructed by Mad Thinker, he was able to control a large number of non-super-humans, most notably members of the Yancy Street Gang to escalate a battle between the two different factions in the superhero Civil War.[volume\u00a0&\u00a0issue\u00a0needed]/nIn that same issue he reveals that he always planned to kill the person he was working with in past team-ups and that he has anger management problems. Mad Thinker gives him the number of a good therapist. This exchange seems to contradict previous interactions between the two.[32]/nThe Puppet Master is then in the business of selling slaves (primarily females). Some of those under his control are superhuman females captured by members of the Chilean Army, and among those held captive are Dusk, Tigra, Silverclaw, Stature, and Ara\u00f1a. The Puppet Master also has random male slaves fight to the death.[33] Once again the Puppet Master is presumed dead when he detonates explosives hidden beneath the house he used as a base, in a battle against Ms. Marvel.[34]/nDuring the Fear Itself storyline, Puppet Master is seen in a comatose state in the Raft's infirmary. It is revealed that Purple Man was the one who had Puppet Master manipulate Misty Knight's Heroes for Hire organization to establish a criminal organization for him while he was in jail. Before he could kill Puppet Master, Elektra and Shroud arrive and prevented Purple Man from killing Puppet Master. Purple Man spared Puppet Master and took control of some inmates to attack Elektra and Shroud before escaping from the Raft.[35]/nPuppet Master later appears by Misty Knight's side where he uses the villains on Misty Knight's side as payback on Purple Man.[36]/nLater, the Puppet Master has been murdered, with all evidence pointing to the Thing as the person responsible. The crime took place in a sealed room that even Mister Fantastic could barely enter with Alicia as the only witness, and even she cannot decipher what has happened.[37] Although the Thing claims innocence, he allows himself to be locked up.[38] As it turns out, the dead Puppet Master was a decoy and the real Puppet Master had been hidden away by the Quiet Man, the mastermind behind Thing's framing and other misfortunes the Fantastic Four had suffered. Mister Fantastic later finds the real Puppet Master captive in the Quiet Man's building.[39]/nThe Puppet Master has no true superpowers, but he does possess a very gifted mind, as well as doctorate in biology, including extensive knowledge of craftsmanship and experimental science. His greatest strength was the skill to create lifelike marionette puppets with extreme speed after Masters molded on those real people. Through intense concentration, Masters is able to control the physical actions of anyone whom that he sculpts from. For how he did this had never adequately explained other than using some type of special neurokinetic clay. The clay he mixed within this solution can be mystical, slightly radioactive, and found in a remote area near Wundagore Mountain (Transia), site to the prison of an elder god Chthon. He cannot control the actions of essentially mindless creatures or supremely strong-willed beings. His manipulative skills are limited to one person at a time, even by far distance. While in his clay form, he possesses its unique features. Masters could split himself into 1/10 smaller replicas, each with a psychic link and shape-changing capabilities.

Her family returned to Turin in 1945./nIn September 1946, Levi-Montalcini was granted a one-semester research fellowship in the laboratory of Professor Viktor Hamburger at Washington University in St. Louis; he was interested in two of the articles Levi-Montalcini had published in foreign scientific journals.[26] After she duplicated the results of her home laboratory experiments, Hamburger offered her a research associate position, which she held for 30 years. It was there that, in 1952, she did her most important work: isolating nerve growth factor (NGF) from observations of certain cancerous tissues that cause extremely rapid growth of nerve cells.[19] By transferring pieces of tumors to chick embryos, Montalcini established a mass of cells that was full of nerve fibers. The discovery of nerves growing everywhere like a halo around the tumor cells was surprising. When describing it, Montalcini said it is: \"like rivulets of water flowing steadily over a bed of stones.\"[27][unreliable source?] The nerve growth produced by the tumor was unlike anything she had seen before \u2013 the nerves took over areas that would become other tissues and even entered veins in the embryo. But nerves did not grow into the arteries, which would flow from the embryo back to the tumor. This suggested to Montalcini that the tumor itself was releasing a substance that was stimulating the growth of nerves./nShe was made a full professor in 1958. In 1962, she established a second laboratory in Rome and divided her time between there and St. Louis. In 1963, she became the first woman to receive the Max Weinstein Award (given by the United Cerebral Palsy Association) due to her significant contributions into neurological research.[26]/nFrom 1961 to 1969, she directed the Research Center of Neurobiology of the CNR (Rome), and from 1969 to 1978, the Laboratory of Cellular Biology.[19] After she retired in 1977, she was appointed as director of the Institute of Cell Biology of the Italian National Council of Research in Rome. She later retired from that position in 1979, however continued to be involved as a guest professor.[28]/nLevi-Montalcini founded the European Brain Research Institute in 2002, and then served as its president.[29][30] Her role in this institute was at the center of some criticism from some parts of the scientific community in 2010.[31]/nControversies were raised about the cooperation of Levi-Montalcini with the Italian pharmaceutical concern Fidia. While working for Fidia, she improved the understanding of gangliosides. Beginning in 1975, she supported the drug Cronassial (a particular mixture of gangliosides) produced by Fidia from bovine brain tissue. Independent studies showed that the drug actually could be successful in treatment of intended diseases (peripheral neuropathies).[32][33] Years later, some patients under treatment with Cronassial reported a severe neurological syndrome (Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome). As per the normal cautionary routine, Germany banned Cronassial in 1983, followed by other countries. Italy prohibited the drug only in 1993; at the same time, an investigation revealed that Fidia paid the Italian Ministry of Health for a quick approval of Cronassial and later paid for pushing use of the drug in treatment of diseases where it had not been tested.[34][35][36] Levi-Montalcini's relationship with the company was revealed during the investigation, and she was criticized publicly.[37]/nIn the 1990s, she was one of the first scientists pointing out the importance of the mast cell in human pathology.[38] In the same period (1993), she identified the endogenous compound palmitoylethanolamide as an important modulator of this cell.[39] Understanding this mechanism initiated a new era of research into this compound which has resulted in more discoveries regarding its mechanisms and benefits, a far better understanding of the endocannabinoid system and new liposomal palmitoylethanolamide product formulations designed specifically for improved absorption and bioavailability.[40]/nLevi-Montalcini earned a Nobel Prize along with Stanley Cohen in 1986 in the physiology or medicine category.

Due to her support of the government of Romano Prodi, she was often criticized by some right-wing senators, who accused her of saving the government when the government's exiguous majority in the Senate was at risk. Her old age was mocked by far-right politician Francesco Storace.[42][43]/nLevi-Montalcini's father, Adamo Levi, was an electrical engineer and mathematician, and her mother, Adele Montalcini, was a painter.[44] The family's Jewish roots extend back to the Roman Empire; due to the family's strict and traditional background, Adamo was not supportive of women attending college as it would intrude in their ability to tend to the children and house.[45]/nLevi-Montalcini had an older brother Gino, who died after a heart attack in 1974.

His father was a social worker who ran a camp in the rocky mountains.[1] After failing high school history, Peck studied to receive his GED.[2] He joined the army after the Vietnam war and was reactivated in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) shortly afterwards. He served an LDS mission in Arkansas.[1] Peck received a bachelor's degree in 1986 from BYU in statistics and computer science with a minor in zoology. He received a master's degree from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in environmental biostatistics, and his PhD from North Carolina State University in biomathematics and entomology in 1997.[3] His dissertation was titled \"Spatial Patterns and Processes in the Evolution of Insecticide Resistance.\"[4] He started teaching in the biology department at BYU in 2000, where he teaches bioethics and the history and philosophy of biology, among other classes.[3][5] In his work on decreasing insect-borne illness, Peck has worked as a consultant on projects with the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.[5] He has also worked on a consultant project with the Korean Federation of Science and Technology.[3]/nPeck has published many scientific articles on ecology and ecological simulations in his work as a professor of biology at BYU.

Several readers believed her to be real. Peck stated that he enjoys mixing fictional references with real ones in his fiction.[15] Rachel Kirkwood, writing in Dialogue felt that the various narrative fragments did not achieve the \"characterization and depth for which the book seems to reach\", but acknowledged that \"the insufficiency of the fragments has its own charm.\"[16] In another Dialogue review, Shane R. Peterson wrote that the book's strength is in its meditations on Mormon theology, and that its weakness was its presentation through the frame story of another character's dissertation, which gave Gilda a \"strange distance\" from the reader.[17]/nThe Tragedy of King Leere, Goatherd of the La Sals (2019) received a starred review in Publishers Weekly, where its setting was described as a \"fascinating world of technological solutions to global warming\".[18] In Dialogue, Kylie Nielson Turley noticed how the book was difficult to categorize, wondering if it was better to call it \"a modern-day ecological interpretation of the famous Shakespearian familial tragedy\" or \"a dystopian novel that will haunt the reader with visions of a post-apocalyptic future\".

The award citation praised his unusual fiction: \"If Peck\u2019s works are medicine, they are strong, strange, and sometimes bitter-tasting. But perhaps this dose is what we need. Peck\u2019s unpredictability confronts both the casual and scholarly readers, both the faithful and faithless, forcing them to question stereotypes, simplistic binaries, and straightforward reversals.\"[26]/nPeck believes that God \"only enters the universe through our consciousness.\"[27] He compares scriptural interpretation to scientific interpretation, in that both nature and scriptures are unchanging, but our understanding of them changes over the course of generations.[27] On the subject of writing, Peck says that it is a way for him to explore the complexities in his life.[28] He stated that anything we do to build our knowledge of the universe helps to build the kingdom of God.[29]/nAs a missionary, Peck taught potential members that they had to renounce evolution before being baptized. As a student at BYU, he found that biology professors taught the theory of evolution in the same way it is taught in secular schools. Peck has since become an advocate for teaching that religion and evolution are not at odds.[30] The LDS church currently has no official position on evolution, and Peck teaches evolution in the courses he teaches at BYU.[31]/nDuring their honeymoon, Steven and his wife, Lori, were hit by a drunk driver in Oregon. They were badly injured, and recovered after six months.[1][2] The experience led Peck to change his major from philosophy to statistics.[30] Steven and Lori have five children.[32] In 2002, Peck experienced visual hallucinations and delusions caused by a bacterial brain infection.[33] The bacteria, Burkholderia pseudomallei, entered his brain through his optic nerve during a research trip to Vietnam in 2001.[34] Peck wrote about the experience and stated that it taught him about the nature of consciousness.[33] On the podcast \"Snap Judgement\", Peck said that the experience taught him that Satan could block God's influence on him, which affected how he views religious belief.[34] Peck lives in Pleasant Grove.[35]", "72928753": "Yvonne Lue is a Jamaican doctor who works in the field of medical microbiology.

Waddington and when many of the fundamental aspects of modern biology were being elucidated by forward thinking scientists at the university's King's Buildings campus.[2][3] Leading a large and diverse research group, she applied the newly developing techniques of modern biology to fundamental questions in the fields of developmental biology and pathology of the eye and the brain. Her work was characterised by a rigorously conceptual approach, methodological innovation and a keen interest in the social and ethical implications of scientific and medical research.[1]/nClayton was born in London on 10 June 1925. She studied zoology at the University of Oxford, gaining an MA.[1]/nClayton joined the Institute of Animal Genetics (University of Edinburgh) in 1947 at a time of rapid expansion under the leadership of the biologist and polymath C.H. Waddington.[1] She was one of the original group of scientists there during the 1950s that included notable figures such as Charlotte Auerbach, Geoffrey Beale, Douglas Scott Falconer, Henrik Kacser, Eric Lucey, Eric Reeve, and Alan Robertson. Waddington's initial solution to staff accommodation problems in Edinburgh was the acquisition of the nearby Mortonhall and an experiment in collegiate living, from which Eric Reeve's wife, the artist Edith Simon drew inspiration for her novel The Past Masters (titled House of Strangers in the USA).[4] In 1965, the Medical Research Council and Wellcome Foundation funded the building of a modern tower block, adjacent to the main Institute of Animal Genetics Crew Building on the university's King's Buildings campus to accommodate the research being undertaken by Waddington and his colleagues.[5] By the 1970s, Clayton, DES Truman, John Campbell, Geoffrey Selman, Joe Jacob, John Bishop, Ken Jones and their research groups occupied the tower, all pursuing different aspects of an explicitly epigenetic research programme.[6] When Ruth Clayton's group outgrew the accommodation available in the tower, she refurbished and occupied the first floor of the Crew Building. She retired in 1993 with Emeritus Reader status.[1]/nEpigenetics in its very broadest sense (and that originally intended by Waddington) is the study of the processes by which the information encoded in genes (the genotype) becomes manifest (is expressed) in the observable characteristics (the phenotype) of an individual during development. The eye in general and in particular the abundant proteins of the eye lens, which are termed crystallins provided Clayton and her colleague DES Truman with an ideal system in which to investigate the link between gene expression and cell differentiation during embryonic development. The complexity of crystallin protein composition and expression were explored by early adoption of a wide range of innovative immunological,[7][8][9] biochemical,[10][11][12][13] molecular, and cellular[14][15][16][17][18] techniques then being developed in Edinburgh and elsewhere. On the basis of these and other studies she developed and advocated the view that the differences in gene expression that underlie cell differentiation are quantitative in nature and combinatorial in effect.[9][19][20] This nuanced view contrasted markedly with the prevailing ideas at that time of a strict demarcation between \u201chouse-keeping\" and \u201cluxury\" gene products, strictly tissue-specific expression of luxury gene products and a single unitary function for individual  proteins.[21] Crystallin gene expression was further explored in a detailed series of studies using long-term cell culture models in which progenitor chick lens cells continuously differentiated into lens fibre cells in controlled laboratory conditions. The intrinsic programme of crystallin gene expression during this process was found to be non-coordinate within and between crystallin protein classes, tightly controlled and resembled the developmental programme seen in the animal itself,[22][23] but it could be modified by age, genotype, cellular growth rate, and soluble factors.[24][25][26][27][28] All of this indicated that the epigenetic programme was intrinsic to the cells, but it could be modified by external and internal variables./nThe epigenetic landscape model of Waddington's proposed that development proceeds by progressive restriction of cell fate, commitment and subsequent differentiation to a range of well-defined cell types. Surprisingly, embryonic chick retinal cells can also differentiate into lens cells under certain conditions when grown isolated in culture; a rare example of the transdifferentiation of one differentiated cell type into another, and a phenomenon that is thought to relate to the capacity of certain species to undergo lens regeneration. Clayton's work showed that although transdifferentiation potential diminishes with age,[29][30] it involves the expression of authentic lens crystallins[17][31][32][33] according to a precise programme that differs in sequence from that seen during lens differentiation.[33][34] The potential for transdifferentiation itself being proposed to be related to the prior low-level expression of lens crystallins.[35][36][37] From a contemporary perspective, what once appeared to some as an experimental curiosity (ocular transdifferentiation) now seems to represent an early recognised example of the kind of cellular reprogramming that underlies contemporary induced pluripotent stem cell technology and its hoped-for application as truly regenerative medicine./nThe contention that extralenticular (non-lens) crystallin expression was biologically significant initially attracted the criticisms that it was either an experimental artefact (perhaps resulting from inadvertent lens tissue contamination) or that it represented an example of non-functional (\u201cleaky\") gene expression. Definitive demonstration of expression of individual crystallin genes in tissues other than lens, and indeed outside of the eye in several vertebrate species by Clayton's group[15][17][18][33][38][39] and other international research groups led to a reversal of this view. A slew of papers ensued on the expression and putative functions of extralenticular crystallins, and specifically their roles in nervous system diseases. Crystallin sequence similarities with, or in some cases their identity to particular enzymes or heat shock proteins[40][41] led to the concept of gene sharing (or protein moonlighting) as fully developed by Joram Piatigorsky.[42] The abundant water-soluble proteins of the vertebrate lens (by definition, crystallins) are therefore now generally considered to be examples of multifunctional proteins with their precise functions being context- and concentration-dependant, consistent with a combinatorial and quantitative role of gene expression in cell differentiation./nClayton's lens research encompassed both studies of normal and abnormal development, and studies of aging, in particular research on the most common cause of blindness world-wide, namely cataract. A direct approach was employed in which candidate risk factors for cataract were investigated in a large-scale case-controlled study correlating clinical, pathological and biochemical data from cataract patients in South East Scotland. Specific risk factors were identified included the levels of particular blood plasma constituents,[43] coexisting clinical (and sub-clinical) disease and medication[43][44][45] and pattern of alcohol use.[46] These studies showed that risk factors were most likely cumulative[47] and that some risk factors correlated with particular cataract types.[48] All of which indicates that so called senile cataract is not a simple function of aging, but more likely has a complex epidemiology, and one in which lens transparency is affected by a life-long accumulation of quantitative and potentially interacting risk factors, both medical and  socio-economic.[47]/nLater in her career, Clayton pursued a series of studies in collaboration with University of Edinburgh zoologist Aubrey Manning. Rodent models and cell cultures were used to assess the potentially deleterious effects on foetal neural development of low-level exposure to pharmaceuticals and environmental contaminants during pregnancy. They found that common anticonvulsant drugs and aluminium sulfate had measurable neurochemical and behavioural effects on pups, dams or pup-dam interactions following low-level pre-natal exposure, and that some of these changes were modified by genetics.[49][50][51][52]/nClayton was married to geneticist George Clayton. She had four children; Anthony (a professor of sustainable development), Christopher (a physicist), Kate (a translator), and Paul (a nutrition scientist).

[5] McSweegan was among a number of Lyme disease experts who were worried about the influence that an advocacy group was having over the NIH, some politicians, and the general public.  The group, called Lyme Disease Foundation, promoted the belief in \"chronic Lyme disease\" and claimed that it required long-term, expensive, and unproven antibiotic treatments. The group was operated by two accountants, received funding from companies that sold intravenous antibiotics, and made claims that lacked scientific support. It also referred people with indeterminate symptoms to chronic Lyme disease-believing doctors who would diagnose them, even though evidence indicated most did not have Lyme disease.[6]/nBeginning in 1995, McSweegan denounced the Lyme Disease Foundation in his personal time and continued to speak out against the group's influence on the NIH.[7][5] The NIH eventually removed him from responsibilities, both related and unrelated to Lyme disease. The media characterized the NIH's actions as retaliation for McSweegan blowing the whistle on NIH mismanagement.[8] In 1997, after noticing that his personal web site characterized the Lyme Disease Foundation as \"whacko\", the NIH suspended him for two weeks.[6] However, the NIH's own lawyers felt there was no basis for firing him. The Lyme Disease Foundation later sued McSweegan for slander, but lost. McSweegan won a countersuit against them. Through the process, he continued to receive positive job reviews.[7]/nThe NIH said it reassigned him to a post as director of the U.S.-Indo Vaccine Action Program. McSweegan told The Washington Post in 2003 that he didn't know he was director of that program, and was instead assigned tasks better suited for an intern.[5]/nReports by the Post and CBS News led Senator Chuck Grassley, then the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, to demand that the NIH give McSweegan work. In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson, Grassley questioned the NIH's uses of taxpayer money, saying it was unacceptable for the NIH to \"come rattling a tin cup asking for more money\" when it was forcing taxpayers to \"pay for full-time novelists.\"[7] The NIH promised to investigate the allegations.[9]/nMcSweegan has commented on diverse issues related to infectious disease. In 2004, McSweegan hypothesized that the mysterious \"English sweating sickness\" may have been an outbreak of anthrax poisoning. He speculated that the victims could have been infected with anthrax spores present in raw wool or infected animal carcasses, and he suggested exhuming the victims for testing.[10] He has also criticized the Centers for Disease Control for investigating Morgellons, a proposed infectious condition whose existence is disputed by current scientific consensus.[11]/nMcsweegan was detailed by the NIH to the Global Virus Network, where he became a program manager.[1] There, he reported on a number of pathogens, including Zika, chikungunya, and Hepatitis C.[12][13][14][15] He worked at the Global Virus Network until 2018.[16]", "38063677": "Stuart J.

When asked why he wrote the book, Firestein replied, \"I came to the realization at some point several years ago that these kids [his students] must actually think we know all there is to know about neuroscience. And that's the difference. That's not what we think in the lab. What we think in the lab is, we don't know bupkis. So I thought, well, we should be talking about what we don't know, not what we know.\"[8]  The book was largely based on his class on ignorance, where each week he invited a professor from the hard sciences to lecture for two hours on what they do not know.  No audio-visuals and no prepared lectures were allowed, the lectures became free-flowing conversations that students participated in./nFirestein explained to talk show host Diane Rehm that most people believe ignorance precedes knowledge, but in science, ignorance follows knowledge.

But I don't mean stupidity. I don't mean dumb. I don't mean a callow indifference to facts or data or any of that,\" Firestein said. Instead, thoughtful ignorance looks at gaps in a community's understanding and seeks to resolve them.[9]/nThe scientific method is a huge mistake, according to Firestein. He says that a hypothesis should be made after collecting data, not before. Firestein claims that scientists fall in love with their own ideas to the point that their own biases start dictating the way they look at the data. Oddly, he feels that facts are sometimes the most unreliable part of research. He feels that scientists don't know all the facts perfectly, and they \"don't know them forever.\"[9]/nAccording to Firestein, scientific research is like trying to find a black cat in a dark room: It's very hard to find it, \"especially when there's no black cat.\" His thesis is that the field of science has many black rooms where scientists freely move from one to another once the lights are turned on.

Carmel is the Snyder Granadar Chair for Genetics, and is the 2021 Massry Prize laureate for his studies in the field of ancient DNA./nCarmel was born and raised in Israel. He studied for a B.Sc. in physics in the Academic Atuda, and served in the military as a physicist in Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd. During his military service, he obtained his M.Sc. degree in quantum mechanics at the Technion - Israel institute of technology, under the supervision of Ady Mann. After his military service, Carmel completed his Ph.D. degree in mathematics and computer science at the Weizmann Institute of Science, under the supervision of David Harel. In his Ph.D. Carmel developed algorithms for odor coding and digitization, and was head of the algorithms team in a company that developed means for computerized odor transmission. In 2004, Carmel went to the United States for postdoctoral studies at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, where he specialized in molecular evolution in the research group of Eugene Koonin./nCarmel returned to Israel in 2008, and established a computational biology research group at the department of Genetics, the Alexander Silberman Institute of Life Sciences, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 2016 he was invited as a senior visiting professor to the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, where he spent a year./nCarmel is studying computational molecular evolution, and is particularly interested in human evolution and ancient DNA. He published dozens of research papers in these fields./nIn 2014, together with Professor Eran Meshorer, he developed a computational technique to reconstruct genome-wide maps of DNA methylation (a key epigenetic mechanism) from ancient DNA sequences. He applied this technique to ancient DNA from Neanderthal and Denisovan, and thus was the first to reconstruct epigenetic patterns of archaic humans, and to identify genes that are differentially methylated between archaic and modern humans.[1] These genes include many that are expressed in the brain, and are associated with neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, autism and schizophrenia. This work was selected among the top ten discoveries of 2014 by Archaeology magazine.[2]/nIn 2017, Carmel developed a tool that identifies organs and body parts that are preferentially enriched within a set of genes.[3] This tool helps in understanding how the human body is affected by changes in the expression levels of genes. Combining this tool with his studies on DNA methylation patterns in archaic humans, and together with Professor Eran Meshorer, Carmel showed in 2020 that the vocal and facial anatomy of modern humans differs from that of Neanderthals and Denisovans,[4] which points at fascinating evolutionary processes during the past hundreds of thousands of years that affected the modern human voice box./nVery little is known about the anatomy of the Denisovan, as its confirmed physical remains include a finger, a few teeth and a lower jaw.[5] In 2019, Carmel developed a computational technique which uses reconstructed DNA methylation maps in archaic humans together with medical information on the phenotypic effects of genes that underlie monogenic diseases, to generate an anatomical profile of archaic human groups.[6] He applied this technique to the ancient DNA of a Denisovan girl to generate a first anatomical profile of these archaic humans. This work was selected among the scientific breakthroughs of 2019 by Science magazine,[7] won 1st People's Choice of Science's breakthrough of 2019,[7] and was selected among the 10 top stories of the year by Science News.[8]/nIn 2020 Carmel published a study on the genetics of the Canaanites.[9] In this work, he sequenced DNA from dozens of Canaanite individuals that used to live in the Southern Levant during the Bronze Age, in sites such as Megiddo and Hazor. Carmel found that the Canaanites formed as an admixture of local populations with people that arrived from the north-east, from regions that today include western Iran and the Caucasus, and that the process continued for hundreds of years. Carmel also found that the different Canaanite populations across the Southern Levant belonged to the same genetic population. In this study Carmel developed a method[10] which he used to show that the ancient Bronze Age populations from the Southern Levant, Caucasus and western Iran substantially contributed to the genetics of present-day Levantine populations such as Jewish groups and Arabic-speaking groups.", "55922266": "Seung-Yong Seong (born c. 1965) is a South Korean immunologist and microbiologist known for his study of innate immune system response and his development of the damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) model of immune response initiation in collaboration with Polly Matzinger.[2] Seong is also known for his research on the bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi and his research on immunological adjuvant when he was a student.[3][4] Since 2013 he has served as Director of the Wide River Institute of Immunology \u2013 Seoul National University in conjunction with his Professor position in the Microbiology and Immunology department of Seoul National University College of Medicine.[5] In 2012, he became Editor in Chief of the World Journal of Immunology.[6]/nSeong earned his medical degree (M.D.) in 1990, from Seoul National University College of Medicine.

From 1995-1998 he worked as a Doctor for Public Health in the Biomedical Research division of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology. While working at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seong's research focused on immunologic study of mucosal membranes and developing a vaccine against Streptococcus pneumoniae, a causative agent of both pneumonia and meningitis.[4][5] In 1998, he became an Assistant professor at Seoul National University College of Medicine in the Microbiology department and in 2010, became a full professor. From 2001 to 2004, Seong worked in the National Institute of Health Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology as a Research Fellow.

He currently acts as President of the Korean Society for Dendritic Cells and Secretary of the International DAMPs Association.The International DAMPs Association is a society of researchers from varying disciplines whose goal is to investigate the numerous roles of Damage associated molecular patterns in disease, injury and infection./nSeong's primary research interest is  the interaction of DAMPs, Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and hyppos (hydrophobic portions exposed on the surface of denatured molecule or molecular aggregates) in immune response initiation. His lab also studies dendritic cells, cancer immunotherapy and single domain antibody therapies.[5] His current research is centered on the DAMPs Model of immune response initiation, and investigating novel hyppo centered treatments for inflammatory diseases.[2] Outside of the DAMPs innate immune response model, Seong's lab is working on developing dendritic cell based cancer vaccines and the development of recombinant camel antibodies specific to tumor antigens for therapeutic use.[5]/nThe major focus of Seong's lab is to obtain a more thorough understanding of the DAMPs model of immunity and the potential impact this model may have in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. The DAMPs model was suggested by Seong in 2004[2] and combines elements of the Self-Non-Self and Danger Model to explain innate immune response.[2] The DAMPs model involves the immune-stimulatory ability of exposed hydrophobic portions of denatured molecules (hyppos, water-insoluble molecules) from both endogenous and exogenous sources. Seong proposes that PAMPs, and alarmin originated from a common DAMPs ancestral subfamily and were modified by the innate immune system to stimulate immune response in addition to cell damage repair. In addition, the DAMPs model suggests that the early immune system evolved from an ancient damage response initiation pathway directed by the presence of hyppos. From the similarities between PAMPs, alarmins, and DAMPs as well as the evolutionary relationship between immune response systems and damage repair response systems, Seong proposed the presence of a universal mechanism of cellular response to injury and instigation of repair.[2]/nIn his study of hyppos and the DAMPs model Seong discovered molecules termed \"hyppo-quenchers\" which prevent initiation of immune responses by hyppos when the cell is not in normal physiological conditions. Hyppo-quenchers prevent immune response by inhibiting interaction between hyppos and their receptors.[7] In studying nuclear factor-\u03baB dependent gene expression Seong found strong evidence that apolipoproteins function as a hyppo-quencher. When exposed to high hyppo levels, cells with apolipoproteins did not initiate immune responses evidencing their role as a hyppo-quencher.[7]/nSeong has continued his study of the DAMPs Model with his research on the role of DAMPs and hyppos in several inflammatory diseases. In particular, his lab studies the role of hyppos in Alzheimer's disease, sepsis, ulcerative colitis and atopic dermatitis. In pathological conditions and cases of cell damage the concentration of exposed hyppos in tissue microenvironment is too great to be resolved by activity of quenchers. When exposed to aqueous conditions hyppos incorrectly aggregate with one another through hydrophobic interactions resulting in potentially toxic proteins and activation of innate immune response resulting in inflammation.[2] Thus, constantly elevated hyppo levels can lead to chronic inflammation.[8] The goal of his study into diseases potentially caused by hyppos is to examine the therapeutic potential of hyppo-quenchers for treatment of inflammatory diseases based on his hypothesis that hyppo-quenchers might have evolved as an immune modulator.[2] Recently, he is carrying out phase I clinical trial for Atopic dermatitis using small molecule that quenches hyppo at micromolar concentration and regulate inflammation at nanomolar concentration by interacting with GPCR19.", "63131229": "Peter J.

She is well known now as an Asian American stem cell researcher and inventor.[1][2] During her career, she co-patented a process that allowed the human stem cell to be isolated, and the patent was granted in 1991. Tsukamoto\u2019s research and contributions in the medical field have led to groundbreaking advancements of stem cell research as it pertains to cancer patients. She is a pioneer in her field, yet is underrepresented for her discoveries./nAnn Tsukamoto earned her Ph.D in immunology and microbiology at the University of California Los Angeles. However, Ann did most of her postdoctoral work at the University of California, San Francisco.[3] Here, she worked on the wnt-1 gene and \u201cdeveloped a transgenic model for breast cancer.\u201d [6]. Tsukamoto's intelligence, determination, and hard work lead her to become one of the most prominent scientists researching and studying stem cells. Ann Tsukamoto's highly-renowned innovations  began in the late twentieth century and she is currently directing further research to discover new findings to advance stem cell research even more./nTsukamoto first patented her research on how to isolate stem cells in 1991. Stem cells research and discovery is imperative not only in scientific communities, but also in the medical field. Ann's work opened the study of stem cells to dive deeper and allowed for a more definitive understanding of the circulatory systems of cancer patients. What Tsukamoto came to find is the importance of stem cells  in the search to find a cure for cancer and many other human illnesses.[4] In 1998, she worked for StemCells Incorporated to continue her research that continued in the isolation of liver and neural stem cells as they affect various diseases.[5] Tsukamoto leads the search for better understanding stem cells and its relation to finding a cure to cancer as well as many other fatal ailments. The cure for cancer and similar illnesses seemed to have no potential cure, which is the pain point that drove Ann to research and study stem cells in a way that would solve this problem and ultimately find a potential cure./nTsukamoto\u2019s innovation, despite being incredibly important, did not make her a household name because of how women were so poorly represented in the scientific and medical field at the time. In addition, when Ann published her discoveries, other scientists did not understand how crucial stem cell research was in how it could be used towards a cure, thus her findings were not considered nearly as transformational as they should have been. Now, stem cells are known to be very important to both medical advancement and science./nAnn's work of stem cell research and its relation to cancer patients saved countless lives and this number is growing exponentially with continued research and treatment. Before Ann's research and discoveries in the stem cell field, there was considered to be no cure for cancer and other illnesses of the same caliber. This is a revolutionary discovery that could change how fatal cancer and similar illnesses are considered in the medical field.[3] As Tsukamoto continues to study stem cells, her contributions and previous legacy remains seen and increasingly more relevant to current research in the field of cancer and stem cells.

He was known to spend many hours fishing in Lake Worth off the center bridge to Palm Beach and in a floating wheelbarrow that he converted into a boat.  He and his brothers, Jack and Bill, after moving to Miami, often swam nude in the Miami River. He graduated from Miami Edison High School./nPrior to  his college education he was a combat officer in WW2.  He landed on Omaha Beach as a platoon commander with the 81st Chemical Mortar Battalion about 45 minutes after the invasion began on D-Day, and was field promoted to Company Commander.  He and his unit stayed in almost constant front line duty from D-Day to the end of the war, then liberating a Nazi labor camp.  After returning from the war Marshall married Kathlene Eppen, a nurse whom he had met in England during the war, and they  had two sons.  He then began studies at the University of Florida where he graduated with a degree in biology Phi Beta Kappa (1953). There he met Dr. Carr and his wife Marjorie and became good friends.  The Carrs were involved in conservation issues at that time, including protecting sea turtles in the Caribbean, and Marshall probably developed his keen interest in conservation from that relationship. Marjorie Carr later began a years long campaign against the Cross Florida Barge Canal and Marshall assisted her in that effort./nOther influences that helped him choose a career as a conservationist where his contacts with some of the great biologists/conservationists in South Florida...these included Dr. Frank Craighead, Dr. Durbin Tabb, Mr. John Clark, Mr. Nathaniel Reed, Mr. Johnny Jones, Dr. Gerald Parker,  Mrs. Marjory Stoneman Douglas, Mr. Timothy Keyser and many others. His interest in conservation developed to a high intensity as he realized how development had altered much of Florida's natural ecosystems./nMarshall received (1957) an MS in marine science from the University of Miami where his research was on the biology of the snook (Family Centropomidae) (5 species) in South Florida.  He worked for several years as a biologist for the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries (later renamed as the National Marine Fisheries Service) in Miami where he studied shrimp trawling and other kinds of offshore fisheries.  In 1955 he began working for the  United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) at their office in Vero Beach, Florida.  His work there included ichthyological surveys studies on the St. Johns River and assessments of many dredge and fill project applications throughout Florida.  He became the office director of the USFWS office in Vero in about 1965.  He resigned from the Service in 1970 and moved to Miami where he became a professor of urban studies at the University of Miami./nMajor projects that he was involved in while an employee of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) included a study of the potential impacts of the Sanibel Causeway on water quality and fisheries in Pine Island Sound,  water quality studies (especially salinity) in the 10,000 islands area of the Everglades, siting studies and ecological impacts of  the proposed Jetport that would otherwise have been constructed in the Everglades,  Marco Island development impact studies, Cross Florida Barge Canal Impact studies, an expansion of Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge, establishment of the Key Biscayne National Monument, and many other projects around Florida.  It was his move to Miami and his friendship with Mrs. Douglas that led him to focus on Everglades issues.  In addition to his role as a scientist he spent much time traveling around South Florida to speak to conservation groups and to county commission meetings about the threat of development (especially farming and water diversions) to the Everglades.  He was also appointed to the board of the South Florida Water Management District in 1972-73.  Since his views were usually quite different that those of the other board members he was eventually forced to resign from the board. (After his death his views became much more widely accepted, and his papers were widely referenced by scientists developing an Everglades Restoration plan)./nMarshall's appointment at the University of Miami also ended when his grant supported projects ended.  He and Kay moved to Interlachen, Florida, where he built a house and eventually found work at the University of Florida.  His job at UF ended when the State of Florida and the University System underwent severe budget cuts.  All UF staff who had less than 2 years of service at that time were released.  Marshall had also been appointed to the first chairmanship of board of the then newly created St. Johns Water Management District.  Again Marshall soon ran into political disputes that led to his dismissal from the board by Governor Reuben Askew.  Marshall spent the balance of his career as a consultant to conservation groups throughout Florida. He continued to campaign, at his own expense, for protection of the Everglades and against the construction of the Cross Florida Barge Canal./nOne of Marshall's ideas was the concept of \u201csystem generalists.\u201d When applied to the Everglades, a generalist means professionals who are not simply scientists specializing in one discipline, but those who possess a full understanding of the chemistry, geology, hydrology, ecology and overall environmental significance of the system and also have an appreciation for its historic and aesthetic value./nHe also wrote what is referred to as \u201cThe Marshall Plan\u201d in the early 1970s, which was a blueprint for Everglades restoration.[1] The plan emphasized the need for 'sheet flow', the slow movement of surface water in a southerly direction that is natural and essential to the Everglades ecosystem. The scheme promoted in the Marshall Plan helps retain water in the wetlands and preserves the original habitat found in the ancient Everglades./nDouglas, author of the 1947 book The Everglades: River of Grass, paid tribute to Marshall in some of her writing. In Florida: the Long Frontier, she wrote, \u201cAlthough my phrase 'River of Grass' first awakened people to the notion of the Everglades as a river, it was Arthur Marshall who filled in all the blanks. More than any other person, he stretched our idea of the Everglades and how we are connected, which created the most powerful arguments for restoring the ecosystem.\u201d[citation needed]/nIn 1984, a year before his death, Marshall was named \u201cConservationist of the Decade\u201d by the Florida Wildlife Federation. He asked to have a chair at the University of Florida named after him, leading to an initial $600,000 endowment for the Arthur R. Marshall Eminent Scholar Chair in the Department of Zoology.[2]/nTwo other living memorials bear his name: the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge in Boynton Beach and the Arthur R. Marshall Foundation,[3] a non-profit West Palm Beach organization founded by Marshall\u2019s nephew, John Arthur Marshall, with the help of Tim Keyser, in 1998. The Foundation has as its mission to preserve and restore the Florida Everglades, in part by educating young people and the public about Everglades ecology through comprehensive public outreach and environmental education programs./nMarshall's numerous writings and salient correspondence were donated to the University of Florida's Smather's Library by his widow...the late Kathlene Eppen Marshall. Additional archives are held at the ArtMarshall.org office in West Palm Beach, and have been made available to researchers.

He also acted as an expert witness in many areas, including animal behavior, environmental policy, native treaties, wildlife law enforcement and policy, and wildlife/vehicle collisions cases in the United States and Canada.[citation needed] He testified on wildlife conservation policy in court, before Senate of the State of Montana and before the Parliamentary Committee on Environment, and Sustainable Development in Ottawa.[citation needed]/nAfter a period of supporting the keeping of game in ranches as a way to use the animals while protecting them, he warned that the Alberta government's recommendation to keep deer in enclosures was a mistake both scientifically and economically. When calamities caused by disease and the collapse of the market forced many ranchers to slaughter their animals and close their farms, this was confirmed.[6]/nGeist became an outspoken commentator on wolves and recognized them as dangerous predators to humans. He was of the opinion that wolves are most likely to fulfill their ecological function in unpopulated and very thinly populated areas. His publications on wolves include as topics also the development of great shyness towards humans by hunting (a shyness now dangerously rare as environmentalists work tirelessly to protect these dangerous animals), hybridization with coyotes, where distribution areas of both species overlap, hybridization with domestic dogs in areas populated by humans, and diseases spread by wolves, for example the dog tapeworm, whose larval stages lead to Hydatid disease in herbivores and humans.[7] By triggering panicky flight behavior in deer packs and causing them to migrate, wolves promote the spread of Chronic Wasting Disease./nIn his lectures and writings he pointed out that wolves cause serious damage to wildlife and that they cause great suffering to wild ungulates such as white-tailed deer, elk, and bison by condemning them to a slow, agonising death when they are torn./nThe paradigm of the self-regulation of nature is, according to his findings, a simple-minded intellectual error. The mechanisms of negative feedback assumed in this concept would not work like this in nature, but selfreinforcing effects would lead to a decline in biodiversity. With active wildlife management and care, humans can achieve a much greater biodiversity and productivity of ecosystems. Humans can save the game the brutality of getting torn by wolves. Hunters practicing ethical hunting would treat game far more humanely than \"nature\" does.[8]/nRegarding the behavior of wolves towards human beings he described seven steps from strong shyness and avoiding the nearness of the human, then searching anthropogenic food sources and habituation, then possible explorative attacks, in which they only approach, up to predatory attacks on people, that usually take place only under the precondition that the seven steps described by him are passed through.[9][10]  He became involved in the inquiry surrounding the death of Kenton Carnegie November 8, 2005 at Wollaston Lake, Points North Landing, Saskatchewan, Canada.[11] Geist expressed growing concern as wolves began to follow his wife outside their home on Vancouver Island and threaten her safety.  When wolves appear friendly, they are simply examining the menu.  He was openly critical of the myth that wolves do not attack people and observed that Joseph Stalin promulgated this Big Lie in his effort to disarm the rural population which had traditionally kept firearms for protection./nGeist also worked in the field of palaeozoology of ungulates and canids and researched the differences in the ecological status of wolves in the Pleistocene megafauna and the present wild fauna. In relation to the respective works, he pointed out the presence of 'Predator pits' that were caused by gray wolf (Canis lupus) predation on Holarctic ungulates, resulting in the lowering of ungulate distributions and populations to suboptimal levels, and kept suboptimal via brown/grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) attrition on ungulate calves during birthing seasons. Further, the explanation offered by Geist to how the Pleistocene ecology of the Gray Wolf did not have the same impacts, were that megafaunal hypercarnivores such as the taxa Machairodontinae, Panthera, and Arctodus simus suppressed them as a direct consequence of intense competition amongst the megafauna predator guild, at the time.[12]/nGeist's interest in Neanderthal people was captured in a National Geographic article suggesting that Neanderthal may not have learned to throw, supported by their hunting methods. He noted the likely possibility that they engaged in cannibalism, and that they may have actually ranched children from other tribes for food.  He suggested that ancient cave art was more likely to be graffiti, left by young men who dared one another to go deep into the earth to make their marks.  In this, he strongly supported R. Dale Guthrie's published views The Nature of Paleolithic Art by Guthrie R. Dale (2006-02-01)./nIn the late 1980s, Geist hypothesized that  \"specialist, aggressive, competitive Rancholabrean fauna\" such as Arctodus were a barrier for humans (along with other Siberian megafauna such as moose, grey wolves and brown bears) when migrating into North America (both Beringia and below the ice sheets).[13] Male A. simus were the largest and most powerful carnivorous land mammals in North America, with the potential specialization in obtaining and dominating distant and scarce resources. Humans in this hypothesis, though familiar with brown bears, would not have been able to avoid predation or effectively compete with Arctodus simus and other large Pleistocene North American carnivores, making human expansion difficult in Beringia and impossible south of the ice sheets.[14][15][16] However, this theory has never been accepted by anthropologists.[16] Paul Matheus argued that there were negligible ecological differences across the mammoth steppe, and that humans successfully competed against and even hunted territorial cave bears, cave hyenas, cave lions, leopards, tigers and wolves in Eurasia before reaching eastern Beringia, making the solitary Arctodus an unlikely impediment to expansion.[16] Indeed, new dates establish an extended co-existence of humans and megafauna such as Arctodus across North America.[17][18][19][20]/nGeist won the Wilderness Defenders Award from the Alberta Wilderness Association in 2004.[21] He is the only North American hunter to be honored with professional membership in both the Boone and Crockett Club[22] and its European counterpart, the International Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation (Conseil International de la Chasse).[citation needed]", "57888439": "Elizabeth Ann Winzeler is an American microbiologist and geneticist.

His research primarily focused on the mechanisms that regulate transcription and their relation to metabolism and circadian clocks. His work focused on understanding how the circadian clock regulates metabolic cycles. Most notably, he discovered that SIRT1, a histone deacetylase with a critical role in gene expression and metabolism, is able to regulate the activity of the CLOCK protein.[2] In 2011, Sassone-Corsi founded and directed the \u201cCenter for Epigenetics and Metabolism\u201d at the University of California, Irvine./nPaolo Sassone-Corsi was born in Naples, Italy on June 8, 1956.[3] He devoted himself to science and soccer at an early age.[4] Together with his brother Emilio Sassone-Corsi, they founded the Neapolitan Astronomy Club (Gruppo Astrofili Napoletani)[5] and eventually published a paper on the bands of Saturn.

The c-fos protein contains a \"leucine zipper\" that allows it to form a heterodimer with jun, another oncogene.[11] In 1988, Sassone-Corsi found that proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-jun are activated through a pathway which regulates transcription; c-fos and c-jun interact with each other to form a homodimer, AP-1, and that c-fos is regulated by cAMP.[1][10] AP-1 is much more stable than either the fos or jun homodimer and can bind to the necessary promoter sequences much more effectively.[11] As such, AP-1 has a significant role in the cell cycle.[12]/nCircadian biology research/nIn 2006, Sassoni-Corsi illuminated the role of chromatin remodeling in circadian mechanisms through the discovery that CLOCK acts as a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) by recruiting P300 and CBP, allowing it to help restore rhythmicity in Clock mutants. This activity allows CLOCK to control the acetylation of BMAL1 and H3.[13] This was important in demonstrating the role of chromatin remodeling in the core clock mechanism and revealed new associations between cellular physiology and histone acetylation. He later helped discover that the histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity of SIRT1, which is NAD+ dependent, undergoes circadian regulation, counteracts the HAT activity of CLOCK, and has in vivo circadian control.[14] In 2009, Sassone-Corsi also helped discover that NAMPT, a rate-limiting step involved in NAD+ salvaging, has circadian expression regulated by CLOCK:BMAL1. His research found that NAMPT was essential to altering the circadian expression of genes; in the same study, he discovered a transcriptional-enzymatic feedback loop between circadian rhythms and cellular metabolism which was an impactful contribution to investigating the links between the two.[2]/nSignaling pathways/nSassone-Corsi was influential in investigating the role of chromatin in signaling with a study he conducted in 2000. He revealed that signaling pathways act directly on chromatin components to regulate certain processes; N-terminal tails of histones are acted upon with reversible covalent modifications to elicit responses in multiple pathways.[15] They investigated the interactions that occur when multiple modifications are present on the N-terminal tails at the same time and proposed that H2B-H3 and H2A-H4 are the tails which act as signaling platforms. His research segued into a broader understanding of the role histone modifications play in the complex circuitries of gene regulation.[15]/nSassone-Corsi looked further into the coupling of histone modifications and found evidence of synergistic coupling of H3 phosphorylation and acetylation in response to epidermal growth factor stimulation.[16] He identified that EGF stimulation activates the MAP kinase pathway which leads to sequential modifications of chromatin.", "65752794": "Mark E.

In 1984 she was the first Spaniard to participate in an international expedition to Antarctica. She received her bachelor's degree in 1957 and a PhD in biological sciences at the University of Barcelona in 1969. In 1960 she started working for the Institut de Ci\u00e8ncies del Mar in Barcelona.[2] In addition, she conducted research at the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) and was a delegate in Catalonia for two years (1984-1986)./nStarting in 1984, she participated in the Organization of Research in Antarctica and assisted with the installation of the Juan Carlos I Antarctic Base on Livingston Island, of which she was the lead oceanographer from 1989 to 1997, replacing Antoni Ballester\u00a0[ca]. From 1989 to 1995 she directed Madrid's National Program of Antarctic Research, and later, from 1994 to 1995, she directed the Institute of Marine Sciences./nShe has been awarded, among other prizes like the Gold Medal of the Generalitat of Catalonia in 1994, the Creu de Sant Jordi Award in 2003, the IEC Environment Prize in 2006 and the CONCA National Award in 2013.[3]/nJosefina Castellv\u00ed was born the daughter of a doctor and housewife in Barcelona during the last few months of the Spanish Republic before the explosive outbreak of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). She studied at the Montserrat Institute[4] and in 1957 graduated with a degree in biology from the University of Barcelona. In 1960 she specialized in oceanography from the Sorbonne. In 1969, Josefina got a doctorate in science from the University of Barcelona./nJosefina and her older sister attended school at an exceptionally young age near Eixample, where their family began. Later, they were transferred to a convent school, where they studied until their second year of high school. Ultimately, they completed their basic studies at the Institute Monsterrat, in the neighborhood of Sant Gervasi, where Josefina prepared to enter university. In spite of living in a postwar period and the immense poverty the country suffered, Josefina's childhood and adolescence were normal; she lived alternately in Barcelona and Castelldefels, where her parents had a house./nIn 1953, around the age of 18, Josefina began studying biology at the University of Barcelona. She completed two tracks in one and graduated in 1957, when she was 22 years old. Only two people finished the degree that year: Josefina and a nun. She continued her studies in order to engage more deeply with her research./nAfter finishing her degree Josefina Castellv\u00ed traveled to France to study for two years. By 1960, when she specialized and received her PhD in oceanography at the age of 25, she participated in her first oceanographic expeditions on French ships and taught at the Sorbonne. Also starting that year, she began work at the Institute of Marine Sciences as Council Superior of Scientific Research, where she would later assume the role of director from 1994 to 1995 whilst also being a delegate to Catalonia. In 1984 she was the first Spanish woman to participate in an international expedition in Antarctica; it ought to be noted that she contributed mainly to those expeditions\u2019 research, for which she was awarded[5][6] recognition alongside Antonio Ballester i Nolla. Ballester was recognized as well for his intervention in the installation of the Juan Carlos I Antarctic Base on Island Livingston,[7][6][8]  of which Josefina was chief director from 1989 to 1993, allowing Spain for the first time to become a member of the Antarctic Treaty System (1988)./nWhen she returned to Barcelona, Josefina continued her research at the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC). First, by experimenting in the laboratory, since at that time Spain lacked oceanographic vessels and bathyscaphes with which to feasibly and directly explore the seas. When, in 1971, scientists provided the first Spanish oceanographic vessel for use in investigations Josefina Castellv\u00ed was able to do her work from within the environment of her scientific subjects and could analyze how those subjects behaved in the midst of the sea currents./nIn 1987 Antonio Ballester, Josefina Castellv\u00ed, and seven others put the first Spanish base in Antarctica, which they created on Island Livingstone and baptized with the name of Juan Carlos I. Josefina Castellv\u00ed was 52 years old by then, yet even at that age, in 1997, she directed an Antarctic base where 12 people lived for four months a year. The research in Antarctica was both a great learning experience and emotionally validating for her. Antarctica is a natural laboratory; deep in the ice there is written billions of years of Earth's history and knowing how to analyze these ancient writings allows us to share that vast history./nIn 1995, after living a few years in Madrid, where she had commissioned the National Research Program Antarctica, Josefina Castellv\u00ed returned to Barcelona to lead the Institute of Marine Sciences of the CSIC. Throughout her working life, she combined her research with conference work in order to disseminate her findings and her books, one of which was a book published in 1996 titled I Have lived in Antarctica./nIn 1994 she received the Gold Medal of Generalitat of Catalonia and in 2003 she received the Creu de Sant Jordi. The Gold Medal is an honorary distinction awarded annually by the Generalitat of Catalonia to those persons or social entities who \"on their merits, have provided outstanding services to Catalonia in the defense of her identity, especially at the civic and cultural level\".[9] Moreover, it is considered, together with the International Prize of Catalonia, to be one of the most prestigious distinctions granted in Catalonia.[10] Since 2010, she has been the president of the Summer University of Andorra./nOn 8 October 2013 she won the Culture of the Generalitat of Catalonia Award, which distinguishes those people, entities, or institutions in any field that are worthy of institutional recognition for his or her contribution to Catalan culture, with preference for excellence, innovation, trajectory and projection, and bearing in mind their contribution during the year before of the concession.[11] In addition, on 13 May 2013 she received the Catalan of the year Award.[12]/nIn 2014 she was appointed vice-president of the Advisory Council for the Sustainable Development of Catalonia (CADS).[13]/nOn 5 March 2015 she received the August Pi i Sunyer Medal from the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Barcelona, in commemoration of International Women's Day.

She also continues to give lectures on her work in Antarctica, during which she testifies to the importance of this frozen desert. As the coldest place on Earth, she says, it is ideal for studying the capacity to adapt inherent in all organisms, which must change to survive, since, if they do not, they will disappear like the trees and plants that have disappeared from Antarctica./nJosefina Castellv\u00ed is the first Catalan and Spanish female oceanographer and has received many awards in recognition of her research. \"The difficult part is to receive first prize\", here she quoted the scientist Ramon Margalef, \"because others come such as mimetic actions.\u201d Of all the awards that she has, Josefina especially values two: the Gold Medal of the Generalitat of Catalonia (1994) and the Creu de Sant Jordi (2003), because they represent the homage of her city and country. Currently, Josefina Castellv\u00ed still lives on the same floor where she was born, a testament to her devotion to origins.[14]/nJosefina Castellv\u00ed has written many books, more than 70 scientific articles in national and international magazines, and has chaired various international committees and commissions related to the oceans and Antarctica.[15][16] Among her books are the following:/n_ 1963: Pigmentos de la diatomea marina Skeletonema costatum (Grev.) en su dependencia de los factores ambientales y de la din\u00e1mica de las poblaciones/n_ 1964: Un sencillo experimento para demostrar la influencia de la concentraci\u00f3n de elementos nutritivos sobre la calidad de los pigmentos de las algas/n_ 1981: Aspectos microbiol\u00f3gicos del estudio oceanogr\u00e1fico de la plataforma continental.

The leader of the expedition, Dr. Antoni Ballester, would end up suffering a stroke that led Josefina Castellv\u00ed to take over and run the small facility at a time when resources were quite limited for the Antarctic program. That was how she became the first female head of a foundation in the history of international Antarctic research. After retiring, she devotes her time to lace bobbin and gardening, her two passions today, but the photos hanging on the wall of her house and her collection of miniature penguins ensure the memory of her greatest adventure. In addition, she finds the suitcase with 30 hours\u2019 worth of film she had captured herself during her first years on the white continent. Because of this and the pressure of nostalgia, Josefina decided to return to Antarctica.[21][22]/nThe documentary was first broadcast on the second channel of Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola on Friday 30 May 2014.[7]/nThe August Pi i Sunyer Medal was instituted by the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Barcelona in March 1983, in memory of one of its most outstanding professors and researchers. The award honors a local-level scientific personality who has recently achieved something of great merit and is delivered in the course of the August Pi i Sunyer Lesson, the moment when the award is given. The first person to receive the medal was the ecologist Ramon Margalef, followed by the ophthalmologist Joaqu\u00edn Barraquer, the cardiologist Valent\u00edn Fuster and the primatologist Jordi Sabater Pi among others. The last person who received the award was the hepatologist and professor of UB Joan Rod\u00e9s in 2010. The researcher Josefina Castellv\u00ed is the first woman to receive this award./nJosefina Castellv\u00ed i Piulachs (Barcelona, 1935) is one of the greatest internationally renowned Catalan researchers. She was a pioneer in Spanish participation in Antarctic research and led the installation of the Spanish Antarctic Base. Her scientific contribution has been very productive in the field of marine bacteriology. Nowadays, she continues to further dissemination and research, although she is professionally retired./nJosefina Castellvi was the Delegate of the CSIC in Catalonia and developed her scientific career in the CSIC too. After graduating in Biological Sciences at the University of Barcelona, in 1960, with an Extraordinary Prize, she entered the Institute of Marine Sciences, previously known as the Institute of Fisheries Research. Some years later, as a research professor specialized in marine bacteriology at the CSIC, she became the director of the Institute. Her passion for the study of bacteria in extreme environments led her to take an interest in Antarctica and, in 1984, she became the first Spanish woman to participate in an international expedition to those icy lands. She has published over seventy scientific papers and participated in 36 oceanographic campaigns./nIn addition to her scientific talent, Castellv\u00ed showed excellent qualities as a research manager, which allowed her to be a CSIC Delegate in Catalonia in 1984 and Director of Coordination of the CSIC in 1986. From 1987 to 1988, she coordinated the installation of the Juan Carlos I Spanish Antarctic Base on Livingston Island and, between 1989 and 1994, she became the Head of the Base. Later, she was manager of the National Antarctic Research Program (CICYT) at the state level, responsible for coordinating international scientific projects developed in that territory.[23]", "1920745": "Stanley \"Stan\" Falkow (January 24, 1934 \u2013 May 5, 2018) was an American microbiologist and a professor of microbiology at Georgetown University, University of Washington, and Stanford University School of Medicine. Falkow is known as the father of the field of molecular microbial pathogenesis.[1] \nHe formulated molecular Koch's postulates, which have guided the study of the microbial determinants of infectious diseases since the late 1980s.[2] Falkow spent over 50 years uncovering molecular mechanisms of how bacteria cause disease and how to disarm them.[1] Falkow also was one of the first scientists to investigate antimicrobial resistance, and presented his research extensively to scientific, government, and lay audiences explaining the spread of resistance from one organism to another, now known as horizontal gene transfer, and the implications of this phenomenon on our ability to combat infections in the future.[1]/nFalkow was born into a Yiddish-speaking household in Albany, New York. His father was a shoe salesman and had immigrated from Soviet Kyiv, Ukraine.[3] \nHis mother came from a family of Jewish immigrants from Poland. She \"rented several of their bedrooms and later opened a corset shop\".[4] Falkow's family was working-class to poor as he described in his memoir.[1] He was therefore a first-generation Jewish American. Falkow worked at a toy shop in order to collect enough money to buy a model microscope, as well as admitted to stealing textbooks, one a nurse's book on infectious diseases, in order to explore microbiology as a career path despite his family's financial situation.[1]/nFalkow attributed his early interest in microbiology to reading Microbe Hunters in 1943, when he was 11 years old, which he found at the public library after the family had moved to Newport, Rhode Island. The book is a dramatization of microbiological research written by American microbiologist Paul de Kruif.[5]\nBecause of poor grades until his senior year of high school, an adviser suggested military rather than college.[4] Falkow described himself as an average student, and below average at mathematics, which he later rectified by working through workbooks of high school and college level mathematics later in his career, after earning his Ph.D., in order to analyze and design experiments.[1] In his memoir, Falkow gives credit to his teachers and acknowledges the role that the systemic oppression of women in America in the 1940s\u20131950s played in his life, stating \"I now understand that I was the beneficiary of the repression of women by our society. The best and brightest women in many communities were relegated to the one intellectual role deemed suitable for them. They became teachers and many poured their love of language, science, music and art into students like me.\"[1]/nFalkow enrolled in biology at the University of Maine, because of their microbiology department. During the summers he worked in pathology at the hospital in Newport, staining slides and assisting in autopsies. He graduated in 1955.[4]\nBefore he started graduate school at University of Michigan he developed extreme anxiety. He was later diagnosed with agoraphobia. He avoided movie theaters and crowded places between 1955 and 1983[4] and dropped out of his first attempt at graduate school because of recurring panic attacks.[3][4] He returned to Rhode Island to live with his parents and work at the Newport Hospital as a technician, focusing on bacteriology and processing and examining patient samples.[1] He re-enrolled in graduate school at Brown University and graduated with a PhD in 1961.[4]/nHe finished his work for his Ph.D. thesis at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) in the Department of Bacterial Immunology.[1] While at Walter Reed, he worked with African-American microbiologist Othello Washington. Washington was older and more experienced than Falkow, but was assigned to be Stan's technician. Upon meeting, Falkow and Washington decided it would be more appropriate and better for both men to work together as a team. The two men worked together on isolating mobile genetic elements and the transfer of genes between E. coli and Salmonella and published a paper together about Proteus species.[1][6] Falkow also worked with Shigella species and contracted dysentery, which lead to hospitalization, after being exposed to infected monkey feces flung at his face by an infected monkey.[1] Multiple times through his training and early career more senior scientists, some Nobel prize winners, recommended that Falkow focus more on mechanisms of gene expression and less on pathogens because \"nobody cares about typhoid\".[1] Falkow remained interested in pathogens despite many warnings from his peers and supervisors that infectious diseases were not interesting and were becoming less frequent in wealthy countries and were therefore a diminishing field of study.[1]/nHis early work in the 1960s focused on the genetic mechanisms, which enable bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics. He showed that organisms, such as Shigella, can possess DNA fragments called plasmids which exist apart from the bacterial chromosome, and that they carry specialized information for survival. Under selective pressure from antibiotics, one species of bacteria can pass its plasmids to another directly without mating, thereby preserving its own specialized survival genes./nIn 1966, he joined Georgetown University School of Medicine as a professor of microbiology. He later moved to Seattle to join the faculty of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Here he described how meningitis and gonorrhea organisms acquire plasmids to become resistant to penicillin and other antibiotics.[1]/nIn the 1970s, Falkow shifted his focus to the infection process. During this period, he showed that a life-threatening diarrhea prevalent in many developing countries is caused by a sub-type of E. coli. He also co-authored (with Royston C. Clowes, Stanley N. Cohen, Roy Curtiss III, Naomi Datta and Richard Novick) a proposal for uniform nomenclature for bacterial plasmids.[7]/nIn 1981, he was named chairman of the Department of Medical Microbiology at Stanford University School of Medicine, a position he held until 1985. While at Stanford, Falkow encouraged Esther Lederberg to continue directing the Stanford Plasmid Reference Center, an internationally used registry for plasmids, transposons and insertion sequences.[8])/nFalkow was married to Rhoda Ostroff in January, 1958 with whom he had two daughters. They divorced in 1983.[4] In December, 1983, he married Lucy S. Tompkins.[4]/nFalkow and Tompkins met while he was a professor at Georgetown University, and she was a medical student who sought Falkow out to work in his lab. At first, Falkow denied the opportunity to Tompkins, claiming that he would not take female graduate students because he was not comfortable having a female student, which was common in the scientific field in the 1960s.[1] Tompkins rebutted his misogyny firmly, and explicitly pointed out that he was discriminating against her based on her gender.[1] Her argument forced Stan to reconsider his bias and he then allowed her to enter his laboratory as a trainee.[1] For the remainder of his career Falkow continued to hire women trainees, and by the end of his career most of his trainees were female.[1] Falkow later became an advocate and ally of gender equality in science and helped encourage many women to pursue scientific careers.[9]/nFalkow had on-going severe anxiety throughout his career. Due to his anxiety early in his career he avoided conferences, airplanes, and giving presentations in general due to the fact that he would shake and sweat noticeably during them.[1] Falkow described his struggle with his mental health as an \"uneasy truce\" with his \"demons\" later on in his career as he learned various coping mechanisms.[1] Because of his anxiety during public speaking, he often employed humor in his teaching and presentations to help cope with the tension of a silent audience, which also lead to most of the audience members finding his talks memorable and enjoyable.[4] Falkow kept his condition a secret from his colleagues during his early career, only privately revealing to Arthur Saz, the chair of microbiology at Georgetown University School of Medicine, that he received and benefited from psychoanalysis treatment.[1] Health insurance for mental health treatment was much better for military employees than academics at the time, and a major reason Falkow continued to work at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research for as long as he did early in his career, but Falkow agreed to a job at Georgetown University because of this disclosure, upon which the chair privately organized Falkow's healthcare benefits to cover his psychoanalysis treatments.[1]/nIn 2004 Falkow was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome and given a prognosis of two years.[4] He died on May 5, 2018, at the age of 84 at his home in Portola Valley, California, of myelodysplastic syndrome.[10] His death was announced and lifetime achievements highlighted in obituaries in The New York Times,[11] Washington Post,[12] Nature,[13] Science,[9] in a press release from the Americain Society of Microbiology[14] and in various international news sources./nFalkow has been referred to as the \"father of molecular microbial pathogenesis\", the study of how infectious microbes and host cells interact to cause disease at the molecular level.[15]\nFalkow adopted the perspective of viewing infection as a process that is ultimately dependent on both the infecting agent and the host.[1][16] He discovered that infectious microbes employ genes that are activated only inside host cells. His work carries clinical applications, such as a new vaccine for whooping cough.[citation needed] From enteric pathogens to sexually transmitted diseases to respiratory infections, his influence has left virtually no field untouched.[17]/nFalkow and his first graduate student, Richard P. Silver, discovered that episomes (plasmids) are nicked into linear pieces of DNA and transported as linear DNA between two bacterial cells during conjugation.[18] He then collaborated with Mexican scientists Emma Galindo and Jorge Olarte to investigate new forms of penicillin resistance in Shigella isolates from pediatric patients in Mexico City, which lead to the discovery of new forms of \"R factors\" - genes responsible for antimicrobial resistance.[19][1] Falkow and trainee Joan Skerman Knapp identified a virulence factor on plasmids of E. coli found in human feces, demonstrating for the first time that the ability to cause disease may be transferable between bacteria.[20]/nFalkow was present at the famous Waikiki beach meeting in 1972 between Herb Boyer (who provided the restriction enzyme EcoRI) and Stanley Cohen (who provided the plasmid) that led to a plan to develop recombinant DNA technology. This led to the first cloning of a bacterial virulence factor, the heat stable toxin of E. coli, in a seminal 1976 paper with Magdalene Yh So, which heralded the application of molecular genetics to understanding gene transfer, and ultimately led to the creation of the field of synthetic biology./nFalkow and his trainees developed many methods that moved biological research forward such as: a method for screening patient samples for enteric pathogens,[21] the identification of Salmonella and Shigella in patient samples based on lysine metabolism,[22] the application of nucleic acid hybridization to distinguish different bacterial species,[23] the application of agarose gels to isolate plasmids of various sizes,[24] isolation and creation of different plasmid backbones now used as cloning vectors,[25] a method for identifying unculturable pathogens based on isolated 16S ribosomal RNA sequence,[26] an optimized version of GFP for flow cytometry applications,[27] and a fluorescence-based method for the detection of genes expressed by pathogens inside of host cells,[28] among many other techniques./nAfter studying the DNA content of many different pathogenic microbes, Falkow became one of the first scientists to suggest bacterial taxonomy should be based on DNA composition rather than phenotypic observations.[29][30]/nFalkow and others created the universal nomenclature scheme for plasmids still in use today.[7]/nFalkow established \u2018Molecular Koch\u2019s postulates\u2019 for defining virulence determinants,[2] which continues to influence thinking and experimental design in infectious disease research.[17]/nFalkow valued and enjoyed teaching as a fundamental part of scientific training and believed that all scientists have a duty to teach and train the next generation.[1] In all of his years of employment at academic institutions, he taught students in some capacity between medical, graduate, undergraduate courses and invited lectures for courses whenever he was able to.[1] In 2010, he recorded lectures on microbial pathogenesis for iBiology, and those videos are still publicly available on the iBiology website and on YouTube.[16] When Falkow became an emeritus Professor at Stanford University, he still taught students. Indeed, he co-taught with Lucy Tompkins a class open to undergraduate and graduate students on the history of Infectious Disease.[31]/nFalkow organized the first international symposium of invited speakers on antimicrobial resistance.[32][1]/nFalkow and his student Vickers Herschfield investigated water sources in the D.C. area to find examples of plasmids containing antimicrobial resistance genes. Unexpectedly, they found that the Potomac River and Rock Creek, considered \"clean\" water sources used for recreation at the time, were full of fecal waste and alerted many government offices about their findings, which were at first largely ignored.[1] In the summer of 1971, Falkow held a press conference warning D.C. citizens not to let their children play in the Potomac River, stating \"one cup of Potomac River water is equivalent to a half gram of human feces\".[1][33]/nFalkow served on the first NIH Recombinant DNA committee to recommend policy guidelines for the use of recombinant DNA to the United States of America Congress.[1] Many of Falkow's publications are referenced in the Recombinant DNA Regulation Act of 1977.[34]/nFalkow worked with the FDA of the United States throughout his career to advocate for the decrease of antimicrobial agents used in livestock feed.[1][35][36]/nFalkow was elected President of the American Society for Microbiology from July 1997 through June 1998. He was elected to the Institute of Medicine in 1997 and received the Maxwell Finland Award from the National Foundation of Infectious Diseases in 1999. He also received in 1999 an Honorary Doctor of Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, and the University of Maine Alumni Career Award. He has received honorary doctorates in Europe and the US. He received numerous awards for his achievements in science, including the Bristol-Myers Squibb Award for Distinguished Achievement in Infectious Disease Research,[37] the Altemeier Medal from the Surgical Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Howard Taylor Ricketts Award Lecture at the University of Chicago, and the Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize.

In his book, he analyzes biomedical evidence pertaining to the genetics, endocrinology, immunology, toxicology, virology, and neuroscience essential for understanding the causes of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).  Lathe contends that the recent increase in reported ASD cases has resulted from increased exposures to environmental toxics, combined with predisposition to genetic vulnerability.  While nothing in his book contradicts research implicating genetic vulnerability as an underlying cause of ASDs, Lathe instead uses evidence showing autism is more prevalent in urban than rural areas to bolster his contention that pollution is a likely culprit as well.  Lathe argues that most children on the autism spectrum have additional physiological problems, and that these, rather than being separate from the psychiatric aspects of ASDs, can produce and worsen the condition.  \"I aim to show how genetics and environmental factors might come together,\" he says.  Lathe's book also describes a cycle of disease that begins with exposure to certain brain damaging toxins, in particular affecting the limbic system, which in turn can lead to autistic symptoms and collateral physical ailments, such as autistic enterocolitis, leading to further brain damage.  With sixty percent of families with a child on the autism spectrum using casein and/or gluten-free diets, Lathe believes that parents are correct in thinking that biomedical intervention can help their children, and that some of these interventions may effectively address environmental causes of ASDs./nLathe's research has led him to develop a theory that without the Moon, there would be no life on Earth.  When life began, Earth orbited much more closely to the Moon than it does now, causing massive tides every few hours, which in turn caused rapid cycling of salinity levels on coastlines and may have driven the evolution of early DNA.  Lathe uses polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which amplifies DNA replication in the lab, as an example of the mechanisms that facilitate DNA replication,  In the laboratory, PCR synthesis is achieved by cycling DNA between two extreme temperatures in the presence of certain enzymes.  At lower temperatures, about 50\u00a0\u00b0C, single strands of DNA act as templates for building complementary strands.  At higher temperatures, about 100\u00a0\u00b0C, the double strands break apart, doubling the number of molecules.  The synthesis of DNA is started again by lowering the temperature, and so forth. Through this process, one DNA molecule can be converted into a trillion identical copies in just 40 cycles.  Saline cycles triggered by rapid tidal activity would have amplified molecules such as DNA in a process similar to PCR, through alternating high and low salinity \u2013 a process dubbed tidal chain reaction (TCR)[8] \u2013 says Lathe, \"The tidal force is absolutely important, because it provides the energy for association and dissociation\" of polymers.[9]/nA contrasting viewpoint is that deep-sea hydrothermal vents, among other scenarios, may have led to the emergence of life (abiogenesis). In addition, the fast early tides invoked may not have been quite so rapid,[10] and it is possible that only 2-3% of the Earth's crust may have been exposed above the sea until late in terrestrial evolution [4]; although mechanistically sound, the tidal chain reaction theory remains speculative.[11]/nThe prion theory has been widely questioned,[12] and the prion (PrP) protein is now recognized to be an RNA-binding protein.[13] Darlix and Lathe propose that retroelements constitute the replicative component of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.[14]/nLathe has also argued that infection may play a role in Alzheimer disease, and has worked with Rudy Tanzi and Rob Moir at Harvard to develop the Antimicrobial Protection Theory of Alzheimer Disease[15] Building on earlier recommendations of an expert group [16] and increasing evidence that there is a causal link between infection and Alzheimer's disease.[17]", "52252437": "Sir Frederick George Thomas Holliday, CBE, DL, FRSE (22 September 1935 \u2013 5 September 2016) was a British marine biologist, academic, academic administrator, and businessman.

In 1935, along with academician Aleksei Bach, he founded the Biochemistry Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.[2] In 1939, Oparin became a Corresponding Member of the Academy, and, in 1946, a full member. In 1940s and 1950s he supported the theories of Trofim Lysenko and Olga Lepeshinskaya, who made claims about \"the origin of cells from noncellular matter\". \"Taking the party line\" helped advance his career.[4] In 1970, he was elected President of the International Society for the Study of the Origins of Life.

He was also a five-time recipient of the Order of Lenin./nAlthough Oparin's started out reviewing various panspermia theories, including those of Hermann von Helmholtz and William Thomson (Lord Kelvin),[3] he was primarily interested in how life began. As early as 1922,[citation needed] he asserted that:/nOparin outlined a way he thought that basic organic chemicals might have formed into microscopic localized systems, from which primitive living things could have developed. He cited work done by de Jong and Sidney W. Fox on coacervates and research by others, including himself, into organic chemicals which, in solution, might spontaneously form droplets and layers. Oparin suggested that different types of coacervates could have formed in the Earth's primordial ocean and been subject to a selection process that led, eventually, to life./nWhile Oparin himself was unable to conduct experiments to test any of these ideas, later researchers tried. In 1953, Stanley Miller attempted an experiment to investigate whether chemical self-organization could have been possible on pre-historic Earth. The Miller\u2013Urey experiment[5] introduced heat (to provide reflux) and electrical energy (sparks, to simulate lightning) into a mixture of several simple components that would be present in a reducing atmosphere. Within a fairly short period of time a variety of familiar organic compounds, such as amino acids, were synthesised. The compounds that formed were somewhat more complex than the molecules present at the beginning of the experiment./nThe Communist Party's official interpretation of Marxism, dialectical materialism, fit Oparin's speculation on the origins of life as 'a flow, an exchange, a dialectical unity'.

O. Wilson, 1975), The Selfish Gene (Richard Dawkins, 1976), and other works promoting an evolutionary explanation for human social behaviour. Not in Our Genes described Dawkins as \"the most reductionist of sociobiologists\". In retort, Dawkins wrote that the book practices a straw man  fallacy by distorting arguments in terms of genetics to \"an idiotic travesty (that the properties of a complex whole are simply the sum of those same properties in the parts)\", and accused the authors of giving \"ideology priority over truth\".[13] Rose replied in the second edition of his book Lifelines. Rose wrote further works in this area: in 2000 he jointly edited with the sociologist Hilary Rose, a critique of evolutionary psychology entitled Alas, Poor Darwin: Arguments Against Evolutionary Psychology. In 2006 he wrote a paper dismissing classical heritability estimates as useful scientific measures in respect of human populations especially in the context of IQ.[14]/nRose wrote the introduction of The Richness of Life (2007) by the prominent American paleontologist, evolutionary biologist, and historian of science, Stephen Jay Gould./nBooks (for selected papers see website Stevenroseonline.net)", "67161901": "Christa Schleper is a German microbiologist known for her work on the evolution and ecology of Archaea.

He has been described as \"an internationally renowned taxidermist\"./nJames Arnold Dickinson was born in Leeds in 1950.[1][2] He recalled in 2008: \"I used to collect bones, feathers and insects ever since I was a boy at school. During my A-levels in the 1960s, I saw an advert in a newspaper about a bursary for a taxidermist training course run by the Museums Association\".[3]/nBetween 1968 and 1971 Dickinson trained at Bolton and Leicester Museums in the United Kingdom, having indeed received the bursary in 1968 from the Carnegie UK Trust and Museums Association.[2][4] His mentors at Leicester were taxidermists Dick Hendry and Ted Williams.[2] Following this, he studied in the museums of Germany and Switzerland, where he was shown practical taxidermy in the form of examples of historical specimens, between January and March 1972.[2] In the same year he married Jean Howard, in Leeds.[5]/nTaxidermy became a widespread art during the 19th century, after advances in the preservation of skins with preparations of arsenic. Its place in museums and private collections, and in zoological research, was well-established by the first half of the 20th century. However by the 1960s there had been a sharp decline in interest \"when taxidermy almost disappeared\". Dickinson said, \"The last great rise in interest was in the 1970s and 1980s ... but all those people who were becoming taxidermists then are ageing now and we're not seeing in increase in young people coming along, saying, I want to be a taxidermist\".[6] During his career, Dickinson was \"one of the last experts in the field\" of conservation-restoration taxidermy.[7]/nDickinson was a chairman of the Guild of Taxidermists, having been a founder member of the Guild in 1976.[4] In 2006, he explained the original aims of the Guild:[8]/nFortunately all ... were in agreement that the most important matter that they needed to address was raising standards. And not just standards of work but standards that affect the way that taxidermy is perceived. In those days many in the conservation world considered taxidermists a serious threat to wildlife.[8]/nDickinson's first employment was as a taxidermist at Bolton Museum, between 1970 and 1971. Following that position, he worked between 1971 and 1972 in City Museum, Sheffield, as a natural history technician.[2]/nAt the North West Museums Service, England, in 1973 Dickinson became natural history officer,[2] then senior conservator in its natural history department. His work covered the repair of taxidermy in museums across Northern England.[4]/nIn 1999 Dickinson restored the Warrington seal, \"the town's most famous animal\". The seal was shot in Paddington Lock on the Mersey near Warrington, in 1908. In that year the 660-kilogram (104-stone) animal was mounted for Warrington Museum & Art Gallery, and its open mouth was \"blanked ... off with painted plaster\". When Dickinson repaired the mouth, he recreated the teeth with moulds made from a seal skull, and replaced the whiskers with some \"rescued from an old tiger\".[9]/nFrom 2001, Dickinson's final appointment before he retired from museum service was as conservation officer in the natural sciences department of Lancashire County Museums Service, a department of Lancashire County Council. The department is based at Lancashire Conservation Studios.[4][10] In 2008 he said that he was \"one of only five dedicated museum taxidermists in the country and accredited to do work for the National Trust\". Describing his work at that time, he said, \"I conserve old natural history items such as prehistoric bones and prepare items for public display in Lancashire museums and across the country. I work on a variety of species for taxidermy including birds, rare parrots, insects and other wildlife\".[3]/nDickinson was involved in taxidermic repairs during the preparations for the re-opening of Leeds City Museum at the former Leeds Mechanics Institute in 2008. He \"produced a number of the new mounts for the Life on Earth gallery\",[11]:\u200a162\u200a including for the Leeds Irish Elk and Armley Hippo skeletons,[3][nb 1] the latter of which was over 100,000 years old.[12][13] Dickinson also repaired the 200-year-old mounted polar bear skin which was donated to the museum by Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society in 1828. He gave it a \"cold shower clean-up\" outdoors, then retouched its face and \"other bare patches\", and remounted it. It is one of the museum's \"most prized exhibits\".[14] Dickinson said, \"There is a real sense of achievement when you see items on public display for scientific and educational purposes.[3]/nDickinson has been involved in workshops and lectures during his career. For example, for the Natural Sciences Collections Association (NatSCA) in 2007 at the Lancashire Conservation Studio he demonstrated the preparation of a small mammal study skin, with a discussion of field data, methodology, and advice covering common difficulties.[15] On 1 April 2015 he gave a talk for NatSCA at a session entitled \"Understanding Museum Taxidermy: Construction, Care and Commissioning\" at the same studio.[16] He gave advice on accessing animal skins to would-be taxidermists: \"If you live near the sea, go beachcombing, for example, and always be on the look-out for roadkill. You get used to driving with one eye in the gutter\".[17]/nOn 29 September 2012 Dickinson took part in a BBC Radio 4 show with Claire Balding, called Taxidermists in Boston Spa, West Yorkshire, in the Ramblings series, number 22.[18]/nDickinson retired from the Lancashire County Museum Service and other work between 2012 and 2014.

It was during this time that she produced a series of intricate and beautiful pencil drawings of the embryos of the Emperor Penguin eggs famously collected on Scott's last expedition (1910-1913) to the Antarctic.[2] This expedition, commemorated in Apsley Cherry-Garrard's 1922 book The Worst Journey in the World[3] (which contained Ewart's report on the Emperor Penguin as an Appendix), aimed to be the first to reach the South Pole, collecting as much scientific data as possible along the way. In particular, it was hoped that evidence would be found about the embryos of Emperor Penguins (thought to be the most 'primitive' of the bird species) to support the theory that there was an evolutionary link between birds and reptiles. In 1911, Edward Adrian Wilson, the expedition's chief scientist, and two colleagues embarked on a gruelling five-week journey to the nearest penguin breeding colony, pulling heavy sledges in total darkness through temperatures of -40\u00a0\u00b0C. They collected five fresh eggs, three of which survived the return journey. Back in Britain, the pickled embryos were sliced and mounted onto slides, with Richard Assheton being assigned the special task of analysing them. It was at this time that Dorothy Thursby-Pelham made her pencil drawings.[2]/nThursby-Pelham, England's first female seagoing scientist.,[1] was also the first woman to play a visible role in the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, contributing papers, attending meetings and serving as assistant editor of the ICES Journal of Marine Science.[4] In a photograph taken outside the House of Lords in April 1929, Dorothy Thursby-Pelham is one of only 3 women scientists among 64 men on the ICES Council.[4]/nThursby-Pelham made extensive surveys of the plaice population in the southern North Sea during the 1930s's.[1] She used annual rings on the otoliths to construct age distributions in stock density by quarter years for a period of about ten years. She was also engaged in tagging and transplantation of plaice from one North Sea sandbank to another. The importance of Thursby-Pelham's work lies in the subsequent use by Ray Beverton and Sidney Holt.

Daily returns of the quantity (Hundredweight) of fish landed at each port, and the average value (\u00a3) per Hundredweight. were instigated, together with recording the number of hours fishing by each vessel. In recent years, these historical datasets, together with more recent information have been digitized and used to demonstrate major changes in plaice and sole distribution over the 20th Century, associated with long-term climate change in the North Sea and patterns of fishing pressure.[7]/nThursby-Pelham gave several memorable interviews to the BBC in the 1930s and 1950s.

Plaice hatched out on sandy shallow shores, relying on their colour to protect them, growing very slowly, taking several years to reach edible size. Miss Thursby-Pelham's talk will pass on to fish for the table. Fish to buy; cooking hints; recipes. And she gives the valuable advice not to be afraid to buy fish when it is cheap.

His father was a pastor of the Reformed Church. From 1878 to 1882 Simond was an assistant in Medical and Biological Sciences at the School of Medicine and Pharmacy in Bordeaux, and he began his medical training there. From 1882 to 1886 he served as director of the leprosarium in Acarouany near Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, French Guiana,[1] where he contracted an attenuated form of yellow fever. He returned to Bordeaux in 1886 and the following year he received his medical doctorate with a prize-winning thesis on leprosy./nIn 1895 he began work at the Pasteur Institute in Paris and while working in the laboratory of Elie Metchnikoff, he was the first to provide a comprehensive description of the sexual reproductive processes of Coccidia. This work provided experimental support for the theory of evolutionary dimorphism which had been put forward by R. Pfeiffer./nIn 1897, when Alexandre Yersin was transferred by the Pasteur Institute to a post in Vietnam, his position in Bombay was filled by Simond, who was to test the efficacy of an experimental antiserum against the outbreak of plague in that city. The following year, Simond was in Karachi where, despite limited resources, he was able to demonstrate that fleas transmit the bacterium Yersinia pestis, the agent causing bubonic plague, from rat to rat, and from rat to human. His ingenious experiments are described in his report to the Pasteur Institute on the spread of plague (\"La propagation de la peste\"), which was published in 1898 by Pierre Paul Emile Roux in the Annales de l'Institut Pasteur.[2]  For this work Simond was awarded the Barbier prize from the French Academy of Medicine.

Reppert (born September 4, 1946) is an American neuroscientist known for his contributions to the fields of chronobiology and neuroethology. His research has focused primarily on the physiological, cellular, and molecular basis of circadian rhythms in mammals and more recently on the navigational mechanisms of migratory monarch butterflies. He was the Higgins Family Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Massachusetts Medical School from 2001 to 2017, and from 2001 to 2013 was the founding chair of the Department of Neurobiology. Reppert stepped down as chair in 2014. He is currently distinguished professor emeritus of neurobiology./nSteven Reppert grew up in the village of Pender, Nebraska, and graduated from Pender Public High School in 1964. His interest in science began in childhood with the cecropia moth\u2014an insect made famous by Harvard biologist Carroll M. Williams, who used the moth in his pioneering work on the role of juvenile hormone in molting and metamorphosis.[1] Reppert continues to rear cecropia from egg to adult each summer./nReppert received his BS and MD in 1973 (with distinction) from the University of Nebraska College of Medicine and was elected as a medical student to the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society.  From 1973 to 1976 he did an internship and residency in pediatrics at the Massachusetts General Hospital. From 1976 to 1979 Reppert was a postdoctoral fellow in neuroendocrinology at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Maryland, in David C. Klein's laboratory, which focuses on the pineal gland and circadian biology.[2] Reppert was on the faculty at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School beginning in 1979 and was promoted to professor in 1993; he directed the Laboratory of Developmental Chronobiology at the Massachusetts General Hospital from 1983 to 2001, when he moved to the University of Massachusetts Medical School.[3]/nReppert has published more than 180 papers. He is the principal inventor on seven patents derived from his research.[4]/nRodent studies have shown that the master brain clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is functional in the fetus before the fetal brain is capable of registering the presence of light. Reppert and colleagues reported that the fetal SCN is entrained to the light-dark cycle before the retinohypothalamic pathway innervates the SCN from the eye.[5]  This finding indicates that the mother, and her entrainment to ambient light-dark cycles, provides the necessary information to the fetus for synchronization. As Reppert states, \u201cMom is functioning as the transducer for the fetal circadian system. She takes in light information to her circadian system, and then that is communicated to the fetal circadian system.\u201d[6] This fetal entrainment persists into the postnatal period and ensures that neonatal behavioral patterns are properly tuned with the environment. Dopamine and melatonin can both act as perinatal maternal entraining signals.[7]/nSteven Reppert and colleagues have made seminal contributions that provide insight into the mammalian circadian clock mechanism./nReppert and colleagues discovered that the SCN contains a large population of autonomous, single-cell circadian oscillators.[8] They cultured cells from neonatal rat SCN on fixed microelectrode array that allowed them to monitor individual SCN neuron activity in culture. Circadian rhythms expressed by neurons in the same culture were not synchronized, indicating that they functioned independently of one another./nReppert and coworkers also discovered the mouse clock genes mPer2 and mPer3 and defined their functions. They found that the mPER2 and mPER3 proteins, as well as the previously discovered mPER1, share several regions of homology with one another and with Drosophila PER.[9][10] Reppert and coworkers found different light responses among the three Per genes.[10]  Unlike mPer1 and mPer2 mRNA levels, mPer3 mRNA levels are not acutely altered by light exposure during the subjective night.  They also found that mPer1\u20133 are widely expressed in tissues outside the brain, including the liver, skeletal muscles, and testis.  To determine the function of mPER1\u20133, Reppert and colleagues disrupted the three genes encoding them.[11] Using double-mutant mice, they showed that mPER3 functions outside the core circadian clockwork, whereas both mPER1 and mPER2 are necessary for rhythmicity./nReppert and colleagues discovered that the two mouse cryptochromes, mCRY1 and mCRY2, function as the primary transcriptional repressors of clock gene expression, and the mPER proteins are necessary for CRY nuclear translocation.[12] This work provided the first portrayal of a negative transcriptional feedback loop as the major gear driving the mouse molecular clock.[13]/nReppert and colleagues found that the core mechanisms for the SCN in mammals consist of interacting positive and negative transcriptional feedback loops.[14] The first loop is an autoregulatory negative transcriptional feedback loop in which the mCRY proteins negatively regulate mCry and mPer gene transcription. The second interlocking feedback loop involves the rhythmic regulation of Bmal1. Rhythmicity of Bmal1 is not necessary for clockwork function, but it helps modulate the robustness of rhythmicity./nReppert and colleagues discovered that the transcription factors CLOCK and NPAS2 have overlapping roles in the SCN, revealing a new and unexpected role for NPAS2.[15] His lab observed that CLOCK-deficient mice continue to have behavioral and molecular rhythms, which showed that CLOCK is not essential for circadian rhythm in locomotor activity in mice.  They then determined, by investigating CLOCK-deficient mice, that NPAS2 is a paralog of CLOCK and can functionally substitute CLOCK by dimerizing with BMAL1.  Finally, they found\u2014by investigating CLOCK-deficient, NPAS2-deficient, and double-mutant mice\u2014that circadian rhythms in peripheral oscillators require CLOCK.[15]  Thus, there is a fundamental difference between CLOCK and NPAS2 that is tissue dependent./nIn 1994, Reppert cloned human and sheep Mel1a melatonin receptor, the first in a family of GPCRs that bind the pineal hormone melatonin, and localized its expression in the mammalian brain to the SCN and the hypophyseal pars tuberalis.[16] Mel1a is believed to be responsible for the circadian effects of melatonin and the reproductive actions in seasonal breeding mammals.[16]/nIn 1995, Reppert cloned and characterized the Mel1b melatonin receptor. He and colleagues found that the receptor was predominantly expressed in the retina, where it is believed to modify light-dependent retinal functions.[17] They identified outbred populations of Siberian hamsters that lacked functional Mel1b but maintained circadian and reproductive responses to melatonin;[18] these data indicate that Mel1b is not necessary for the circadian and reproductive actions of melatonin, which instead depend on Mel1a./nElucidation of the molecular nature of the melatonin receptors has facilitated definition of their ligand-binding characteristics and aided the development of melatonin analogs that are now used to treat sleep disorders and depression.[16]/nIn 2003, Reppert began investigating the functional and evolutionary properties of the CRY protein in the monarch butterfly. He identified two Cry genes in the monarch, Cry1 and Cry2.[19]\nHis work demonstrated that the monarch CRY1 protein is functionally analogous to Drosophila CRY, the blue-light photoreceptor necessary for photoentrainment in the fly. He also demonstrated that monarch CRY2 is functionally analogous to vertebrate CRYs and that monarch CRY2 acts as a potent transcriptional repressor in the circadian clock transcriptional translation feedback loop of the butterfly, as his group previously showed for the two mouse CRYs.[12] These data propose the existence of a novel circadian clock unique to some non-drosophilid insects that possesses mechanisms characteristic of both the Drosophila and the mammalian clocks.[20] Other insects, such as bees and ants, possess only a vertebrate-like CRY, and their circadian clocks are even more vertebrate like.[21] Drosophila is the only known insect that does not possess a vertebrate-like CRY./nIn 2008, Reppert and colleagues discovered the necessity of CRY for light-dependent magnetoreception responses in Drosophila. They also showed that magnetoreception requires UVA/blue light, the spectrum corresponding with the action spectrum of Drosophila CRY.[22] These data were the first to genetically implicate CRY as a component of the input pathway or the chemical-based pathway of magnetoreception. Applying these findings to his work with the monarch, Reppert\u2019s group showed that both monarch CRY1 and CRY2 proteins, when expressed as a transgene in CRY-deficient flies, successfully restore light-dependent magnetosensitivity function. These results propose the presence of a CRY-mediated magnetosensitivity system in monarchs that may act in concordance with the sun compass to aid navigation. In 2011, Reppert's lab also discovered that human CRY2 can substitute as a functional magnetoreceptor in CRY-deficient flies, a discovery that warrants additional research into magnetosensitivity in humans.[23][24] However, interpretation of the above CRY-dependent magnet work needs to be viewed in the context of a paper by Bassetto et al. 2023  that suggests that there is no evidence for magnetic field effects on behaviour in Drosophila.[25] Moreover, the authors could not reproduce magnetosensitivity in Drosophila using the binary T-maze apparatus developed in Reppert\u2019s lab.[22] Reppert defends the work from his lab showing fruit fly magnetosensitivity and questions the conclusions reported in Bassetto et al., 2023.[26] Further work is needed to refute or verify the proposed lack of magnetoreception in Drosophila./nSince 2002, Reppert and coworkers have pioneered the study of the biological basis of monarch butterfly migration.[27][28] Each fall, millions of monarchs from the eastern United States and southeastern Canada migrate as much as 4,000\u00a0km to overwinter in roosts in Central Mexico.[29]  Monarch migration is not a learned activity, given that migrants flying south are at least two generations removed from the previous year's migrants.[30] Thus, migrating monarchs must have some genetically based navigational mechanism./nReppert and colleagues have focused on a novel circadian clock mechanism and its role in time-compensated sun compass orientation, a major navigational strategy that butterflies use during their fall migration.[29] Using clock-shift experiments, they showed that the circadian clock must interact with the sun compass to enable migrants to maintain a southerly flight direction as the sun moves daily across the sky.[31] Reppert collaborated with Eli Shlizerman at the University of Washington and Daniel Forger at the University of Michigan to propose a working mathematical model of the time-compensated sun compass.[32]/nThe monarch clockwork model, which has both Drosophila-like and mammal-like aspects, is unique because it employs two distinct CRY proteins. As presented in a review article,[28] the clock mechanism, on a gene/protein level, operates as follows:/nReppert\u2019s lab expanded upon Fred Urquhart's postulation that antennae play a role in monarch migration. In 2009 Reppert and coworkers Christine Merlin and Robert Gegear reported that, despite previous assumptions that the time-compensation clocks are located exclusively in the brain, there are also clocks located in the antennae, which \"are necessary for proper time-compensated sun compass orientation in migratory monarch butterflies.\u201d[33]  They concluded this by comparing the sun compass orientation of monarch migrants with intact antennae and those whose antennae had been removed.[33] Reppert's lab also studied antennae in vitro and found that antennal clocks can be directly entrained by light and can function independently from the brain.[33] Further research is needed, however, on the interaction between the circadian clocks in monarch butterfly's antennae and the sun compass in the brain./nIn 2012, Reppert and colleagues determined that only a single antenna is sufficient for sun compass orientation. They did so by painting one antenna black to cause discordant light exposure between the two antennae; the single not-painted antenna was sufficient for orientation. All four clock genes (per, tim, cry1, and cry2) were expressed in the various studied areas of the antenna, suggesting that \"light entrained circadian clocks are distributed throughout the length of the monarch butterfly antenna.\"[34]/nIn 2013, Reppert and Patrick Guerra showed that spring remigrants also use an antenna-dependent time-compensated sun compass to direct their northward flight from Mexico to the southern United States.[35]/nUsing anatomical and electrophysiological studies of the monarch butterfly brain, Stanley Heinze working in Reppert\u2019s lab provided evidence that the central complex, a midline structure in the central brain, is likely the site of the sun compass.[36]/nReppert and colleagues Patrick Guerra and Robert Gegear showed that migratory monarchs can use a light-dependent, inclination-based, magnetic compass for navigation on overcast days.[37] Genetic studies from Christine Merlin\u2019s laboratory show that the photoreceptive CRY1 protein is essential for the monarch\u2019s light-sensitive magnetic compass.[38] The successful use of reverse genetics in monarchs would indicate that the butterfly is an excellent choice for helping to delineate the molecular mechanism underlying light-dependent magnetosensing in the context of compass navigation./nReppert and Patrick Guerra showed that fall migrants prematurely exposed to overwintering-like coldness reverse their flight orientation to the north. The temperature microenvironment at the overwintering site is essential for successful completion of the migration cycle: without cold exposure, aged migrants continue to orient to the south. The discovery that coldness triggers the northward flight direction in spring remigrants underscores how vulnerable the migration may be to climate change.[39][40]/nIn 2011, Reppert and colleagues presented the draft sequence of the monarch butterfly genome and a set 16,866 protein-coding genes. This is the first characterized genome of a butterfly and of a long-distance migratory species.[41][42][43]/nIn 2012, Reppert and colleagues established MonarchBase, an integrated database for the genome of Danaus plexippus. The goal of the project was to make genomic and proteomic information about monarch butterflies accessible to biological and lepidopteran communities.[44]/nIn 2013, Christine Merlin and Scot Wolfe developed in Reppert\u2019s lab a novel gene-targeting approach in monarchs that uses a zinc finger nuclease strategy to define the essential nature of CRY2 for clockwork function in lepidopterans.[45] Targeted mutagenesis of Cry2 indeed resulted in the in vivo disruption of circadian behavior and the molecular clock mechanism. Further work in Merlin\u2019s lab has shown that nuclease strategies are powerful tools for targeting additional clock genes in monarchs and altering gene function.[46]/nIn 2016, Reppert collaborated with Marcus Kronforst at the University of Chicago and others to use population genetic studies to define the evolutionary history of the monarch migration.[47]", "27152228": "Victoria Elizabeth Foe (born 1945) is an American developmental biologist, and Research Professor at the University of Washington's Center for Cell Dynamics.[1] She is known for her work on the development of embryos./nAs a child, Foe moved around a lot, living in the United States, Mexico, and England.[2] Foe has a B.S. from the University of Texas at Austin (1966).[3] She then earned a Ph.D. from University of Texas at Austin, where she started working with Hugh Forrest[4] and then finished at the University of Washington, where she studied with Charles Laird.[5] Her postdoctoral work was with Bruce Alberts at the University of California in San Francisco.[4][6]/nFoe joined the zoology department at the University of Washington in 1991.[4] Foe is a founding member of the Center of Cell Dynamics at Friday Harbor Laboratories, within the University of Washington.[7] She has not taught or gone down the traditional path of mentoring young scientists, not wanting to get caught up in administrative duties as a professor.

In 2001, his book Future Evolution was published, featuring illustrations by artist Alexis Rockman.[6][7]/nWard and Brownlee are also co-authors of the book The Life and Death of Planet Earth, which discusses the Earth's future and eventual demise as it is ultimately destroyed by a warming and expanding Sun. The book picks up where Rare Earth leaves off, this time talking about how and why the Earth and its ability to support complex and especially intelligent life is actually not just rare in space, but also in time. See also Future of the Earth./nAccording to Ward's 2007 book, Under a Green Sky: Global Warming, the Mass Extinctions of the Past, and What They Can Tell Us About Our Future,[8] all but one of the major mass extinction events in history have been brought on by climate change. The author argues that events in the past can give valuable information about the future of our planet. Reviewer Doug Brown goes further, stating \"this is how the world ends.\" Scientists at the Universities of York and Leeds also warn that the fossil record supports evidence of impending mass extinction. Recently, Ward is slowly starting to shift his interest toward climate change because of his experiences with studying mass extinctions, as well as justifying why intelligent life, including humanity, is especially even rarer than complex life in general in terms of both space and time, as intelligent life only lasts for just a few thousand years before finally collapsing and going extinct, as seen in the book The Flooded Earth: Our Future in a World Without Ice Caps, which documents the effects of ongoing and future man-made climate change.

Previously, it was believed that autotrophs obtained their energy solely from light, not from reactions of inorganic compounds.  With the discovery of organisms that oxidized inorganic compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and ammonium as energy sources, autotrophs could be divided into two groups: photoautotrophs and chemoautotrophs.

Clinical studies were introduced in the first year of medical school. Medical students were required to pursue research projects. This innovative approach significantly influenced medical schools in the United States.[2]/nKrampitz's research involved the use of isotopes in the study of the carbon metabolism of bacteria,[4] until his research switched to biohydrogen in the context of the 1973 oil crisis.[6] In 1978 he resigned his positions and retired. He kept a small laboratory and visited it every day until he fell ill in the early 1990s.[2]/nKrampitz was awarded in 1958 an honorary doctorate from Macalester College.[1] He was elected in 1968 a foreign member of the Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften[6] and in 1978 a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences.[2]/nHe married Norma Peterson in 1931.

Following his studies in Austria he became a visiting scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the laboratory of the late Arnold Demain (1989\u201391) and later joined the laboratory of Anthony Sinskey and JoAnne Stubbe at MIT as a postdoctoral associate from 1991 to 1993. From 1993 till 1998 he headed the fermentation and process development group at Metabolix Inc., a small startup company in Cambridge, Massachusetts./nIn 1998 he left industry to join the faculty at Dartmouth where he focused his research on protein engineering, glycoprotein engineering in yeast, and life cycle analysis of competing manufacturing technologies.  In addition to this work, Gerngross\u2019 lab also developed a novel protein expression system based on the industrial fermentation organisms Ralstonia eutropha, formerly Alcaligenes eutrophus.  With certain model proteins, this expression system has shown to outperform E. coli, the well proven workhorse of prokaryotic protein expression.[6][7]  The work on Ralstonia eutropha was later expanded in collaboration with Prof. Wood at Princeton University to combine recombinant expression of proteins with the ability to purify them in vivo.[8][9]/nIn the late 1990s Gerngross became one of the first vocal critics of biobased processes. By using life cycle assessment tools he demonstrated the shortcomings of bioplastics and similar biomass based technologies intended as a substitute for the petrochemical processes used today. His main findings showed that changing from petrochemical to biomass-based processes often worsens their environmental impact and increases the emissions of carbon dioxide when compared to conventional processes based on fossil fuel stocks. With the recent mandate to increase biofuel content in the United States this area of research has become increasingly important, but to date has failed to guide public policy in the United States.[10]/nArguably, Gerngross' most important biotechnological contribution consisted of humanizing the glycosylation machinery in yeast to produce human therapeutic proteins, including antibodies, with fully human carbohydrate structures.[11] Much of this work was conducted at Glycofi, Inc., a Lebanon, New Hampshire biotechnology startup company that was acquired in 2006 by Merck in a record-setting $400 million transaction.[12]/nHis work has been frequently cited in the popular press including The Times (London), CNN, Scientific American,[13] BBC,[14] The Guardian,[15] The Economist, New Scientist,[16] Nature Biotechnology[17]  and the Los Angeles Times.[18] He has most recently been covered by the Boston Globe,[19][20] CNBC,[21] First Rounders,[22] Evaluate Pharma,[23] STAT[24] and numerous others./nIn 2000 Gerngross co-founded Glycofi, Inc.[25] and served as the company's Chief Scientific Officer until its acquisition by Merck & Co. in the spring of 2006.

In regard to his educational background, Dujardin was largely self-taught, the son of a watchmaker./nDujardin worked with microscopic animal life, and in 1834 proposed that a new group of one-celled organisms be called Rhizopoda. He denied naturalist Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg's theory that microscopic organisms were \"complete organisms\" similar to higher animals, specifically noting that they had specialized structures unique to single-celled organisms, which meant that foraminifera he was studying was not, as his contemporaries believed it to be, a mollusk.[1] In addition to his studies of microscopic life, he did extensive research on invertebrate groups that included echinoderms, hexapods, helminths and cnidarians./nIn the Foraminifera, he noticed an apparently formless life substance that he named \"sarcode\", later renamed protoplasm by Hugo von Mohl (1805\u20131872)./nDujardin also remains famous for the identification and the first description in 1850 of the mushroom bodies (corpora pedunculata)[2] in the hymenopteran brain (bee, bumblebee, sphex, ant, fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, etc.), which he postulated for the first time that they were the site of intelligence.

Using genome assemblies from across the Apicomplexa (which includes malaria and toxoplasmosis parasites) it was shown that genetic synteny (genes arranged in the same groupings in different genomes) was substantially less than expected from animal genomes, suggesting that the parasite genomes have undergone major rearrangements or that their most recent common ancestor is more ancient than previously thought.[8] In 2012 her lab helped develop a computational tool, MCScanX, to identify synteny across genomes, which has been cited >650 times.[9][10]/nKissinger continues to make big data obtained from investigations into parasites as accessible as it can be.

She used her medical training from the Women's Medical College of the New York Infirmary for research rather than medical practice, and over the course of her career worked on developing vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests for many diseases, including diphtheria, rabies,[1] scarlet fever, smallpox, influenza, and meningitis. Notably, a strain of diphtheria-causing bacteria that Williams isolated and cultivated was instrumental in producing an antitoxin to bring the disease under control.[2] In 1932, she became the first woman to be elected chair of the laboratory section of the American Public Health Association.[3]/nAnna Wessels Williams was born in 1863 in Hackensack, New Jersey, to Jane Van Saun and William Williams. After graduating from a local high school in 1883, she became a schoolteacher.[4]/nLife of Williams was to change course in 1887, when her sister Millie narrowly escaped death giving birth to a stillborn child. Anna believed that the poor training of the doctor in attendance was partly to blame for the tragedy, and so she resolved to resign from her teaching position and retrain as a physician.[2] Later that year Williams enrolled in the Woman's Medical College of the New York Infirmary, where she was taught by Elizabeth Blackwell[5] and Mary Putnam Jacobi.[3] Williams later wrote:/nI was starting on a way that had been practically untrod before by any woman. My belief at the time in human individuality, regardless of sex, race, religion or any factor other than ability was at its strongest. I believed, therefore, that females should have equal opportunities with males to develop their powers to the utmost.[6]/nAfter graduating in 1891, Williams taught pathology and hygiene at her alma mater, and underwent further medical training in Vienna, Heidelberg, Leipzig, and Dresden.[4]/nIn 1894, Williams volunteered at the New York City Department of Health's diagnostic laboratory, the first municipal laboratory in the United States, which had opened just a year earlier in response to a cholera outbreak.[4] Williams worked closely with the director, William H. Park, on his projects to tackle diphtheria. In her first year of work she was able to isolate a strain of the diphtheria bacillus which could be used to produce the antitoxin for diphtheria, discovered in 1890, in large quantities. This crucial discovery massively increased the availability of the antitoxin and slashed its cost, and so was instrumental in controlling this devastating disease. Within a year of Williams' discovery, the antitoxin was being shipped to doctors in the United States and England free of charge to address the enormous demand, and Williams was appointed to a full-time staff position as assistant bacteriologist.[2]/nAlthough it was Williams who made the discovery while Park was away, laboratory work is by nature collaborative, so the strain was named Park-Williams No. 8 after both researchers. However, Park-Williams No. 8 was soon shortened in informal usage to Park 8.[2] Though some in her position might have been resentful, Williams did not attach much importance to having things named after her, and said \"I am happy to have the honor of having my name thus associated with Dr. Park.\"[3]/nIn 1896 Williams traveled to the Pasteur Institute in Paris hoping to find a toxin for scarlet fever that could be used to develop an antitoxin, as she had done for diphtheria. She was unsuccessful, but while there, Williams developed a new interest in the rabies research that was going on in Paris. On her return to New York, she brought a culture of the virus to use in the development of vaccines. Williams managed to produce small quantities of a rabies vaccine from this culture, and after this early demonstration, producing the vaccine became a research priority in the United States.[2] By 1898, an effective vaccine had been developed that could be produced on a large scale.[3]/nWilliams then turned her attention to another problem in the treatment of rabies: diagnosis. Rabies can have a very long incubation period, meaning that by the time it is diagnosed, it is often too late for a vaccine to be of any use. If it was possible to diagnose rabies before the disease had progressed, more patients would survive. By studying the brains of infected animals, Williams discovered that before symptoms appear, the virus was causing changes to brain cells, which could be used to detect the disease at an earlier stage. Unfortunately for Williams, an Italian doctor called Adelchi Negri had made the same discovery, and in 1904 he was the first to publish his results,[7] so the abnormal cells became known as Negri bodies./nIn 1905, Williams developed a new method for preparing and staining brain tissue to show the presence of Negri bodies, which gave results in minutes rather than days. Her method surpassed the original test and became the standard technique for diagnosing rabies for the next thirty years.[4] In 1907, when the American Public Health Association established a committee on the standard methods for the diagnosis of rabies, they named Williams chair of the committee in recognition of her expertise./nIn 1905, Williams was promoted to the position of assistant director of the Department of Health laboratory where she had worked since 1894. In this role, she worked toward the better diagnosis and treatment of venereal disease with Emily Barringer, M.D. and, in collaboration with Josephine Baker's Division of Child Hygiene, developed a better diagnostic test for trachoma, a disease that was claiming the eyesight of many of the urban poor, particularly children.[4]/nDuring World War I, Williams directed a training program at New York University for the War Department, to train war workers for medical laboratories at home and overseas. She also researched methods for diagnosing meningitis carriers in the military. After the war ended, Williams was one of the scientists of the front lines of research trying to combat the deadly 1918 pandemic of Spanish flu.[4]/nIn addition to her laboratory research, Williams coauthored two influential books with William Park, with whom she continued to work closely after their collaboration on the diphtheria antitoxin. In 1905, the pair published their classic text Pathogenic Micro-organisms Including Bacteria and Protozoa: A Practical Manual for Students, Physicians and Health Officers which quickly became known simply as 'Park and Williams' by readers. By 1939 the publication had been reprinted in eleven editions. In 1929, Williams and Park published Who's Who Among the Microbes, thought to be one of the earliest biomedical reference books written for the public.[4]/nOver the course of her career, Williams received many honours and awards. In 1915 she was elected president of the Woman's Medical Society of New York.[4]  In the 1920s, Williams had done extensive studies on scarlet fever. The Dick test, which was developed by George and Gladys Dick, was to detect the disease on thousands of children. William had surveyed hundreds of cases that were positively diagnosed with the disease for the antitoxin that had been used. In 1931 she was elected to an office in the laboratory section of the American Public Health Association and the following year became the first woman appointed chair of the section. In 1936, the New York Women's Medical Society honored Dr. Williams for her services to the city at a testimonial dinner. In her acceptance speech, she thanked the colleagues she had worked with over the years, including many of the women who were building careers in bacteriology alongside her or under her own mentorship at the Department of Health./nIn 1934, despite an outpouring of support, Williams along with nearly a hundred other workers was made to step down from her position by New York City's mandatory retirement age of seventy.[4] Upon her retirement, mayor Fiorello La Guardia accurately summed up Williams' career: she was, he said, \"a scientist of international repute\".[8] After retiring, Williams lived another twenty years with her sister in Westwood, New Jersey, where she died in 1954 at the age of ninety.[5]/nThis article incorporates text from the United States National Library of Medicine\u00a0([1]), which is in the public domain.", "42258456": "Eva J.

Though his career produced findings that are important and valuable to many areas in the field of fertilisation, including his work on in vitro fertilisation which led to the first \"test tube baby\", he was best known to the world for his contribution to the development of the combined oral contraceptive pill at the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology./nChang was born on October 10, 1908, in the village of Dunh\u00f2u (\u6566\u539a), which lies 64 miles (103\u00a0km) northwest of Taiyuan, the capital city of Shanxi province, in Qing dynasty China.[1] His family was able to provide for him a good education, and in 1933, he obtained a bachelor's degree in animal psychology from Tsinghua University in Beijing. In 1938, Chang won a national competition and was awarded one of the few available fellowships to study abroad. He went to spend a year at the University of Edinburgh studying agricultural science, but found that the university was not to his liking due to a combination of the cold weather and a perceived bias against foreigners there.[2] On an invitation from Arthur Walton, Chang left the University of Edinburgh and went on to research ram spermatozoa at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge.[3] With his newfound interest in reproductive biology, Chang immersed himself in research, working together with other scientists such as John Hammond and F.H.A.

It was apparent that they worked well together and Chang would eventually spend the rest of his career at the foundation, researching mammalian fertilisation. Funds became increasingly available for research on reproduction from the 1950s, and the Foundation attracted a number of talented scientists. Chang guided and advised these scientists, may of whom would go on to become leaders in the field of reproduction. While at the Foundation Chang's work contributed to the development of the oral contraceptive, making him one of the co-founders of the combined oral contraceptive pill.[2]/nOne of Chang's notable achievements was his research and testing of the effectiveness of certain orally administered steroids in the control of mammalian fertility. This led to his co-invention of the first birth control pill with Gregory Pincus. Chang is arguably most remembered for this endeavor as the birth control pill came to have a tremendous influence on human society and the sexual revolution. However, controlling fertility was not the primary concentration of his work. Chang's interest lay in sperm, eggs, and the fertilisation process itself. The ability to control the fertility of eggs was a necessity to his work. He initiated the study of orally administered contraceptives for mammals to enable him to better conduct his research in fertilisation. Indeed, throughout the span of his 45-year career, only five years, 1951 to 1956, were spent researching and testing the effectiveness of orally administered contraceptives, and this work was mainly on the oral mode of the administration of the contraceptive steroids, rather than on the effectiveness of the steroids themselves, which had already been previously proven.[2]/nChang's body of work in mammalian fertilisation is large and appears in nearly 350 publications. One of his major discoveries was the effect of lowering temperature on sperm. Chang found that at a temperature of 13\u00a0\u00b0C or lower, the membrane structure and function of sperm would disintegrate, thus destroying the fertilising capacity of the sperm. This phenomenon is now commonly known as cold shock. Yet another of Chang's major discoveries was his observation on the relationship between the number of available sperm and the effective fertilisation of ova by the sperm. It was believed that the fertilisation of the egg was dependent on there being a large number of available sperm in the fertilisation process. Chang found that it was actually the physiological structure of the individual sperm that affected the actual fertilisation of the egg, and that having a large number of sperm was not necessary. He then posited that the purpose of having a large number of sperm in the fertilisation process was to allow for greater genetic recombination, in that only the strongest sperm would reach the site of fertilisation through the female reproductive tract. The process of capacitation, the maturation period of sperm that is required in order for them to be able to fertilise ova, was also one of Chang's major discoveries. This observation would lead him further to find that capacitated sperm would lose capacitation if exposed to seminal plasma or blood serum, and that recapacitation could be achieved if the sperm was placed back in the uterus or the fallopian tubes.[2]/nOf all his research and experimentation, Chang's work in in vitro fertilisation was arguably his greatest achievement. In 1935, Gregory Pincus had claimed to have achieved successful mammal birth from the result of in vitro fertilisation of rabbit eggs. As nobody, including Chang, could repeat this feat at the time, doubts were cast over the authenticity of the claim. Then finally, in 1959, Chang in vitro fertilised a black rabbit's eggs with a black rabbit's sperm, transferred them to a white rabbit, and was able to produce a litter of young black rabbits. This was the sort of evidence attesting to the feasibility of in vitro fertilisation for which many scientists had been searching. In the years that followed, Chang and his associates conducted further research to determine specific conditions of successful in vitro fertilisation as well as to perform the technique on other mammals such as hamsters, mice, and rats. It was on the basis of Chang's findings that the first in vitro fertilisation of human eggs was performed, leading to the birth of the world's first \"test tube baby\" in 1978.[2]", "62836768": "Ximena Londo\u00f1o de la Pava (born 1958 in Cali, Colombia) is a Colombian botanist, specializing in agrostology.

From 1936 to 1943, Alexander was the associate in pediatrics before continuing to work her way up the professional chain by becoming assistant professor in 1943, associate professor in 1948, and finally professor from 1958. She retired in 1966.[3] While at the Columbia-Presbyterian Babies Hospital, Alexander became the main authority on bacterial infections and the lead microbiologist in the laboratory.[6] From 1941 to 1945, she served as a consultant to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson on the Influenza Commission.[7] Alexander was the first woman to serve as president of the American Pediatric Society.[8] Alexander died of liver cancer[9] in New York City on June 24, 1968. Her obituary was published in The New York Times and The Baltimore Sun, which recognized her for producing the first treatment for influenzal meningitis.[9]/nAlexander's work aimed to advance research of infectious diseases and the biology of the microorganisms that cause meningitis in a time before antibiotics or vaccinations. Her research focused primarily on the mechanisms and effects of meningitis in children which at the time had a high mortality rate.[3][9] Alexander started her studies by trying to identify the prognostic and diagnostic strategies of meningitis.[3] She was able to successfully identify in one of her early studies the prognostic ability of cerebrospinal fluid in precipitin tests. Hattie noted that those with a positive precipitin test result had a higher rate of mortality than those with a negative result.[3]/nIn the wake of the development of an anti-pneumonia serum at New York's Rockefeller Institute, Alexander reported a cure rate for infants of 75% with influenzal meningitis in 1939.[10] In the early 1940s, Alexander began researching Haemophilus influenzae (Hib) meningitis, at the time an almost invariably fatal disease in infants and young children.[4] She started experimenting with rabbit serum and in 1939 she referenced in one of her research papers that the results looked promising for children.[3] Alexander later experimented with sulfonamides and its effects on pyogenic meningitis.[3] She concluded that sulfonamides are insufficient in treating meningitis alone, and those who were treated with sulfonamides and recovered only did due to the antibodies that they produced. These experiments led her to develop an improved antiserum for the disease; by combining rabbit serum therapy with the use of sulfa drugs.[3] This combination became the lead treatment of meningitis until antibiotics.[3]/nBy developing standardized techniques for diagnosis and treatment, she and her associate Grace Leidy helped reduce the mortality rate from Hib from nearly 100 percent to less than 25 percent. Later, Alexander and Leidy studied the effect of antibiotics on Hib, finding streptomycin to be highly effective.[11][12] The combined use of the antiserum, sulfa drugs, and antibiotics significantly lowered the mortality rate from Hib.[4]/nIn the course of her research on antibiotics, Alexander noted and reported the appearance of antibiotic-resistant strains of Hib. She concluded, correctly, that this was caused by random genetic mutations in DNA which were positively selected through evolution; she and Leidy demonstrated the occurrence of transformation in the Hib bacillus, leading to resistance.[4]/nAlexander received numerous honors and awards for her work, including the E. Mead Johnson Award (1942), the Elizabeth Blackwell Award (1956), and the Oscar B. Hunter Memorial Award (1962). In 1963 was awarded Babies Hospital Distinguished Service Medal, and in 1964, she was elected president of the American Pediatric Society. She was the first woman to be elected to this position.[13] Even after her death, Hattie Alexander was honored for her service and accomplishments.

She received a Medal of Honor with Purple Ribbon and was awarded as an Order of the Precious Crown Third Class for her academic accomplishments and leadership in women\u2019s education in Japan.[2]/nYasui was born in the town of Sanbonmatsu in Kagawa Prefecture in 1880, to the owner of a shipping business. She was the first child of nine siblings and was raised by parents who valued and emphasized education. When she was moving from lower elementary to higher elementary school, her father persuaded her to read Encouragement of Learning, a highly influential book written by the philosopher and educator Yukichi Fukuzawa. Throughout her early education, she excelled in her studies, and was particularly gifted in science and mathematics.[3] She graduated from Kagawa Prefecture Normal School in 1898 and the Division of Science at the Women's Higher Normal School in 1902. She taught at Gifu Girls' Higher School and Kanda Girls' School until 1905, when a graduate course was established at the Women's Higher Normal School. She was the first woman to enter the course with a major in science research; she focused on zoology and botany. She published a paper about the Weberian apparatus of carp fish in Zoological Science in 1905, becoming the first woman published in the journal. Her research on the aquatic fern Salvinia natans was published in the Journal of Plant Sciences and the British journal Annals of Botany, marking the first publication of a Japanese woman's research in a foreign journal.[4] She completed the graduate program at Women's Higher Normal School in 1907 and became an assistant professor at the school.[2]/nWhen Yasui applied to the Japanese Ministry of Education to study abroad, they were hesitant to give her permission because of their belief that \u201ca woman cannot achieve much in science.\u201d She was only allowed on the condition that she listed \"home economics research\" alongside \"scientific research\" on her application and that she agreed not to marry and instead commit herself to her research.[2] She traveled to Germany and the United States in 1914 to perform cytological research at the University of Chicago.[5] She travelled to Harvard University in 1915, where she conducted research on coal under Professor E. C. Jeffrey. She returned to Japan in June 1916 and continued researching coal at Tokyo Imperial University (now the University of Tokyo) until 1927. She taught genetics there from 1918 to 1939, and was made a professor at the Women's Higher Normal School in Tokyo in 1919. She completed her doctoral thesis, \"Studies on the structure of lignite, brown coal, and bituminous coal in Japan\", in 1927, becoming the first woman in Japan to complete a doctorate in science.[2]/nIn 1929, Yasui founded the cytology journal Cytologia. From 1924 onwards, she researched the genetics of poppies, corn and Tradescantia species, and in 1945 she began a survey of plants that had been affected by nuclear fallout after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.[5] When Ochanomizu University was established under its current name in 1949, Yasui was appointed professor.[2] She retired in 1952, becoming a professor emerita.[5] By 1957 she had published a total of 99 scientific papers.[2]/nKono Yasui accomplished a lot of firsts during her life and career as a biologist and cytologist. Her career lasted from the late Meiji period, through the Taisho (1912-1926), to the early Showa period (1926-1989). During this time, women were strongly oppressed in Japan and were all but outlawed from working in research and academia.[3] She was the first Japanese woman to publish an academic paper in an international journal.[2] Most notably, she was the first Japanese woman to receive a doctoral degree in science, and she did so at a university that did not accept female students until almost 20 years later.[6] During her time as a teacher at Tokyo Women\u2019s Higher Normal School, she was very strict and did not treat her students as \u201cgirls.\u201d Outside of the laboratory and classroom, however, she was known to be kind to her juniors and students alike. She heavily valued and contributed to the advancement of women\u2019s education in Japan. After World War II, Yasui worked to establish a national university for women. These efforts were successful, as she played a pivotal role in the transformation of Tokyo Women\u2019s Higher Normal School to Ochanomizu University in 1949.[3] She also donated the money received as gifts for her retirement to the Tokyo Women\u2019s Higher Normal School as the \u201cYasui-Kuroda Scholarship,\u201d which continues to provide educational opportunities for young female researchers today.

He studied medicine at Heidelberg, Munich and Berlin, graduating in 1925.  In the same year he moved with his new wife to England and studied first under John Newport Langley at Cambridge and then Henry Dale at Hampstead.  In 1927 he returned to the Physiological Institute in Berlin but he was dismissed in 1933 during the Nazi purge of Jewish scientists. With the aid of Archibald Hill's Academic Assistance Council, Feldberg was relocated to Britain's National Institute for Medical Research in 1934\u201336. Here, he worked with Henry Hallett Dale, providing a significant impetus for Dale's Nobel Prize winning research into chemical neurotransmission. Feldberg was subsequently offered a place in Australia, at the behest of Charles Kellaway, director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. He spent two years (1936\u201338) in Melbourne, joining Kellaway's snake venom research programme. This work developed into a study of tissue responses to direct and indirect insult, focusing particularly on the liberation of histamine and other endogenous mediators. A finding of lasting pharmacological interest from these studies was the identification and partial isolation of the slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis. Although Feldberg had earned a fellowship supported by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, in 1938 he was offered a readership in physiology at Cambridge University. He returned to England to take up this post, remaining there throughout World War II until 1949. Feldberg's subsequent appointments include: Head of Physiology and Pharmacology Division, National Institute for Medical Research, London, 1949\u201365 (Honorary Head of Division, 1965\u201366); Head, Laboratory of Neuropharmacology, National Institute for Medical Research, 1966\u201374.

He was one of the leading figures in the development of microcinematography in Paris and its use in science research and education.[1]/nComandon studied microbiology in Paris from 1902 to 1906 and, afterwards, attended the University of Paris until 1909.[1] Inspired by early films capturing Brownian motion, he learned how to use the ultramicroscope. For his doctoral thesis he used the ultramicroscope to study spirochaete obtained from syphilis patients at the H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis. His mentor, Paul Gastou, connected him with Charles Path\u00e9 who allowed Comandon to perform his research at Path\u00e9's film studio in Vincennes. The two of them developed a new camera system that allowed Comandon to better isolate syphilis spirochetes based on their characteristic movements. He published his thesis, along with his film Spirochaeta Pallida (Agent de la Syphilis), in October 1909.[2][3]/nBefore and after serving as a physician for the French military during World War I, Comandon worked with Path\u00e9 to produce hundreds of educational scientific films on several topics such as microbiology, botany, and infant health. In the process he made several achievements in the practice of microcinematography, including the creation of the first x-ray film and, later, the first x-ray film of a human heart.[4] However, most of the films he made during this time have been lost./nAfter Path\u00e9 discontinued development of scientific films, Comandon earned a position at the Pasteur Institute with Pierre de Fonbrune, with whom he would go on to found a microcinematography center in Garches.[1]/nComandon's doctoral thesis attracted much attention from the scientific community in France and around the world.[5] Although much of Comandon's work was done for commercial purposes, his developments to the practice of microcinematography proved useful in studying bacteria and diagnosing bacterial infections much earlier than previously possible. Still, his involvement with a major film producer allowed the technology to be distributed to more scientists, making its use in medical sciences possible.[1] His work was one of the major catalysts for the popularization of cinematography in scientific research, allowing for temporal manipulation of scientific perception in addition to spatial.[6]/nThe popularity of Comandon's films helped bring scientific film at large into the public eye. The ability to see microbes in motion and, later, the implementation of time-lapse cinematography proved a compelling novelty and made Comandon's films a source of entertainment as well as education.[7] These films demonstrated that cinema depicting more abstract figures could appeal to mass audiences.[7]", "69587059": "John Michael Jumper is an American senior research scientist at DeepMind Technologies.[4][5][6] Jumper and his colleagues created AlphaFold,[7] an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict protein structures from their amino acid sequence with high accuracy.[8] Jumper has stated that the AlphaFold team plans to release 100 million protein structures.[9] The scientific journal  Nature included Jumper as one of the ten \"people who mattered\" in science in their annual listing of Nature's 10 in 2021.[8][3]/nJumper was educated at the University of Chicago where he was awarded a PhD in 2017 for research on using machine learning to simulate protein folding and dynamics, being co-supervised by Tobin R Sosnick and Karl Freed.[1] Jumper also studied physics at the University of Cambridge, where he was on the Marshall Scholarship,[10] and holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics and Mathematics from Vanderbilt University.[2]/nJumper's research investigates algorithms for protein structure prediction.[4]/nAlphaFold[7][11] is a deep learning algorithm developed by Jumper and his team at DeepMind, a research lab acquired by Google's parent company Alphabet Inc.

While there, he collaborated with evolutionary biologist Rachael Winfree in looking at bee populations across 23 farms in central New Jersey and Southeastern Pennsylvania. Their findings concluded that native bees alone provided sufficient pollination at 90 percent of the farms.[1] In 2008, Williams' research team used an experimental approach to understand the landscape-scale ecology of native bumblebees by establishing 38 bee colonies across central California. Throughout the summer, they found that the further a colony was from natural areas, the fewer worker bees it sustained. Williams' team also found that bees always collected pollen from both crops and native plants. Therefore, they concluded that a mosaic landscape that has natural areas mixed in with agriculture was important in keeping bee colonies healthy.[3] His overall pollinator conservation research helped form the basis for USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service' planting guidelines to enhance pollinators.[2]/nIn 2009, Williams left Bryn Mawr to accept an assistant professor position at the University of California, Davis (UC Davis).[2] During his tenure at UC Davis, Williams continued to focus on the ecology and evolution of bees and other pollinator insects.

She has served as head of laboratories, lead academic supervisor of students, and as a significant intellectual contributor. Specifically, her contributions have been on research done on revealing hGCMa as a placenta-specific transcription regulator, possibly involved in the expression of multiple placenta-specific genes. She contributed to research on the human centromere protein B found to induce translational positioning of nucleosomes on \u03b1-satellite sequences.[8] She worked on understanding the genomic regulation of HLA-G and how the presence of a LINE1 gene silencer may explain the limited expression of HLA-G.[9] She also contributed to the research on mice with characteristics of down syndrome in order to understand the genotype-phenotype characteristics of down syndrome in humans.[10]/nTsuneko was an associate professor in molecular biology at the School of Science in Nagoya University from 1967 to 1983. She held this position until she became a lead professor from 1983 to 1997. In 1997, she moved to the Institute of Comprehensive Medical Science, Fujita Health University, where she was a professor for  five years and then became a visiting professor until 2008. Additionally, throughout the years of 2004 to 2007, her main job was in the Stockholm office, where she was the director of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. She was also CEO/president and director of Chromo Research Inc. from 2008 to 2015.[4]/nIn 1963, after coming back from conducting research at Washington and Stanford University along with her husband, Tsuneko had her first child. She then had her second child in 1973. Due to the lack of nursery care in Japan at the time, Tsuneko had difficulty finding help to take care of her children, as she was working full-time with her research. She was part of a citizens' campaign where she marched for more availability of child-care support.[11] Reiji Okazaki died in 1975, but Tsuneko continued working to complete the research they were working on./nTsuneko was awarded the L'Or\u00e9al-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science in 2000.[12]/nShe was also awarded the Medal with Purple Ribbon in 2000, the Order of the Sacred Treasure, [and] Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon in 2008.[13]/nIn 2015, Nagoya University created the Tsuneko and Reiji Okazaki Award, \"in honor of the spirit and legacy of Professors Okazaki.\"[14]/nIn 2015, she was elected as a Person of Cultural Merit.[15]/nIn 2021, she received the Order of Culture.[16]", "36491446": "Alfred Detlef Fritz Kahl (18 February 1877 \u2013 November, 1946) was a German schoolteacher who took up microscopy in mid-life and became a leading authority on ciliated protozoa. In a burst of scientific productivity that lasted just nine years, he published 1800 pages of scholarly work, in which he described 17 new ciliate families, 57 genera, and about 700 previously unknown species. During his brief career as a protozoologist, he redescribed and illustrated nearly all the species of ciliates known in his time, and fit them into a taxonomic scheme that remains influential today.[1][2]/nKahl was born in the municipality of Warwerort, in the Dithmarschen district of Germany, a region of the country that includes the city of Hamburg. Official records show that he taught primary school in Hamburg, from 1897 to 1901, and that by 1934 he was teaching English, French and Natural History at a Gymnasium (High School) in Hamburg. Nothing else is known about his early life. His interest in ciliates began, according to his own account, when his daughter was studying under Eduard Reichenow, then head of the protozoa department at the Hamburg Tropical Institute: \"The very interesting literature and preparations my daughter Lucia brought home fascinated me, as a dedicated biologist, and created the desire to study this field more deeply\u2026Thus, I enthusiastically commenced literature reading and investigation of the small water bodies in my surroundings at the beginning of the year 1924. Within nine months, I got a rather solid knowledge in drawing and identifying many species.\"[1]/nKahl's first scholarly work, published in 1926 when he was 49 years old, was a 241-page monograph on \"new and little-known forms of holotrich and heterotrich ciliates.\" In the course of the next nine years, he issued a steady series of important articles, culminating in his compendious, 4-volume study of free-living ciliates, Wimpertiere oder Ciliata (Infusoria), published as part of a series on German wildlife, edited by the zoologist Friedrich Dahl. This lavishly illustrated work, which combines new research with meticulous historical and taxonomic investigations, was completed in 1935. At this point, Kahl abruptly stopped publishing./nThe reasons for Kahl's withdrawal from the field are not known. The ciliatologist Wilhelm Foissner speculates that he was discouraged by harsh criticism from academic colleagues, and rejection by academic journals.[1] Despite these setbacks, his work continued to win admirers among researchers involved in the classification and identification of ciliates. Sometime in the early 1940s he returned to his microscope, producing the first part of what was supposed to be another 4-volume treatise on the infusoria. The first volume made it into print. However, in the turmoil and confusion of wartime Germany, the second part of the projected work was lost, and the remaining sections were never completed. In November 1946 (the exact date is uncertain) Alfred Kahl died of unknown causes, at the age of 69.[1]/nKahl worked alone, using a basic monocular microscope, equipped with an oil-immersion objective providing a maximum magnification of 500X. He preferred to examine living subjects, and rarely used fixed specimens or chemical stains. From his close scrutiny of living organisms, he produced simple informative freehand drawings to accompany his written observations./nDespite his simple procedures, absence of collaborators and lack of formal training, he came to dominate his field, to the extent that the period from 1930-1950 has been characterized as the \"Kahlian era\" of ciliate systematics.[3] During his decade of activity, he nearly doubled the number of known ciliate species, and created a body of scholarship that is still cited with regularity. This accomplishment has been described by the ciliatologist John O. Corliss as an \"unbelievable record [that] has never been--and is hardly ever likely to be--met in the annals of protozoology and microscopy, past, present, or future.\"[2]", "52908222": "Nevan J.

He inspired Victor Branford to form the Sociological Society in 1903 to promote his sociological views./nWhile he thought of himself primarily as a sociologist, it was his commitment to close social observation and ability to turn these into practical solutions for city design and improvement that earned him a \"revered place amongst the founding fathers of the British town planning movement\".[19] He was a major influence on the American urban theorist Lewis Mumford./nHe was knighted in 1932, shortly before his death at the Scots College in Montpellier, France on 17 April 1932.[20]/nPatrick Geddes was influenced by social theorists such as Auguste Comte (1798\u20131857), Herbert Spencer (1820\u20131903), and French theorist Frederic Le Play (1806\u20131882) and expanded upon earlier theoretical developments that led to the concept of regional planning./nHe was a proponent of the Comte-LePlay view of the interconnectedness of city region as a potentially autonomous unit.[21] He adopted Spencer's theory that the concept of biological evolution could be applied to explain the evolution of society, and drew on Le Play's analysis of the key units of society as constituting \"Lieu, Travail, Famille\" (\"Place, Work, Family\"), but changing the last from \"family\" to \"folk\".[22] In this theory, the family is viewed as the central \"biological unit of human society\"[23][24] from which all else develops. According to Geddes, it is from \"stable, healthy homes\" providing the necessary conditions for mental and moral development that come beautiful and healthy children who are able \"to fully participate in life\".[25]/nGeddes drew on Le Play's circular theory of geographical locations presenting environmental limitations and opportunities that in turn determine the nature of work. His central argument was that physical geography, market economics and anthropology were related, yielding a \"single chord of social life [of] all three combined\".[24][26] Thus the interdisciplinary subject of sociology was developed into the science of \"man\u2019s interaction with a natural environment: the basic technique was the regional survey, and the improvement of town planning the chief practical application of sociology\".[24][27]/nGeddes' writing demonstrates the influence of these ideas on his theories of the city. He saw the city as a series of common interlocking patterns, \"an inseparably interwoven structure\", akin to a flower. He criticised the tendency of modern scientific thinking to specialisation. In his \"Report to the H.H. the Maharaja of Kapurthala\" in 1917 he wrote:/n\"Each of the various specialists remains too closely concentrated upon his single specialism, too little awake to those of the others. Each sees clearly and seizes firmly upon one petal of the six-lobed flower of life and tears it apart from the whole.\"[25]/nThese ideas can also be traced back to Geddes' abiding interest in Eastern philosophy which he believed more readily conceived of \"life as a whole\": \"as a result, civic beauty in India has existed at all levels, from humble homes and simple shrines to palaces magnificent and temples sublime.\"[25]/nGeddes distinguished two forms of human social life: \u2018paleotechnic\u2019 and \u2018neotechnic.\u2019 He viewed the former as self-destructive but the latter as self-supporting. In the context of cities, paleotechnic cities are those characterized by competition while neotechnic is characterized by interaction. Additionally, this is followed by the paleotechnic city\u2019s desire for expansion as compared to the neotechnic city\u2019s ability to form communities and conurbations. Geddes attributed the destruction of cities via World War I not to the invasion of imperialist powers but the prevalence of paleotechnic forms of life in European society.[28]/nAgainst a backdrop of extraordinary development of new technologies, industrialisation and urbanism, Geddes witnessed the substantial social consequences of crime, illness and poverty that developed as a result of modernisation. From Geddes' perspective, the purpose of his theory and understanding of relationships among the units of society was to find an equilibrium among people and the environment to improve such conditions./nGeddes championed a mode of planning that sought to consider \"primary human needs\" in every intervention, engaging in \"constructive and conservative surgery\"[29] rather than the \"heroic, all of a piece schemes\"[30] popular in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He continued to use and advocate for this approach throughout his career./nVery early on in his career Geddes demonstrated the practicality of his ideas and approach. In 1886 Geddes and his wife, Anna Geddes, purchased a row of slum tenements in James Court, Edinburgh, making it into a single dwelling. In and around this area Geddes commenced upon a project of \"conservative surgery\": \"weeding out the worst of the houses that surrounded them\u2026widening the narrow closes into courtyards\" and thus improving sunlight and airflow.[31] The best of the houses were kept and restored. Geddes believed that this approach was both more economical and more humane./nIn this way Geddes consciously worked against the tradition of the \"gridiron plan\", resurgent in colonial town design in the 19th century:/n\"The heritage of the gridiron plans goes back at least to the Roman camps. The basis for the grid as an enduring and appealing urban form rests on five main characteristics: order and regulatory, orientation in space and to elements, simplicity and ease of navigation, speed of layout, and adaptability to circumstance\".[32]/nHowever, he wished this policy of \"sweeping clearances\" to be recognised for what he believed it was: \"one of the most disastrous and pernicious blunders in the chequered history of sanitation\".[33]/nGeddes criticised this tradition as much for its \"dreary conventionality\" as for its failure to address in the long term the very problems it purport to solve. According to Geddes' analysis, this approach was not only \"unsparing to the old homes and to the neighbourhood life of the area\" but also, in \"leaving fewer housing sites and these mostly narrower than before\" expelling a large population that would \"again as usual, be driven to create worse congestion in other quarters\".[32]/nDrawing on the scientific method, Geddes encouraged close observation as the way to discover and work with the relationships among place, work and folk. In 1892, to allow the general public an opportunity to observe these relationships, Geddes opened a \"sociological laboratory\" called the Outlook Tower that documented and visualized the regional landscape. In keeping with scientific process and using new technologies, Geddes developed an Index Museum to categorise his physical observations and maintained Encyclopedia Graphicato, which used a camera obscura to provide an opportunity for the general public to observe their own landscape to witness the relationships among units of society. Geddes would host tours throughout the tower and boast its maps, photographs, and projection via \u2018camera obscura\u2019 in order to present the sociological dimensions of cities, urban problems, and town planning. During his tours he would use the camera obscura on the top floor to demonstrate the outlook of an artist then take visitors to the balcony to show the outlook of technical professionals like geologists, geographers, etc. He used specific instruments and tools to better convey the outlook different people had of the region. The Outlook Tower is a physical assertion of Geddes belief in the importance of all areas of knowledge; all arts, all sciences, all, religions, all cultures, etc. The Outlook Tower embodies the integration of local, the regional, and the global aspects of knowledge. Geddes used it as a tool for cultural and regional analysis and provided space for many thinkers to explore the idea of 'regions' which he later introduced to the field of planning.[34] The Outlook Tower was built in Edinburgh's Old Town and continues to be used as a museum./nGeddes advocated the civic survey as indispensable to urban planning: his motto was \"diagnosis before treatment\". Such a survey should include, at a minimum, the geology, the geography, the climate, the economic life, and the social institutions of the city and region. His early work surveying the city of Edinburgh became a model for later surveys./nHe was particularly critical of that form of planning which relied overmuch on design and effect, neglecting to consider \"the surrounding quarter and constructed without reference to local needs or potentialities\".[35] Geddes encouraged instead exploration and consideration of the \"whole set of existing conditions\", studying the \"place as it stands, seeking out how it has grown to be what it is, and recognising alike its advantages, its difficulties and its defects\":/n\"This school strives to adapt itself to meet the wants and needs, the ideas and ideals of the place and persons concerned. It seeks to undo as little as possible, while planning to increase the well-being of the people at all levels, from the humblest to the highest.\"[35]/nIn this sense he can be viewed as prefiguring the work of seminal urban thinkers such as Jane Jacobs, and region-specific planning movements such as New Urbanism, encouraging the planner to consider the situation, inherent virtue and potential in a given site, rather than \"an abstract ideal that could be imposed by authority or force from the outside\".[36]/nIn 1909, Geddes assisted in the early planning of the southern aspect of the Zoological Gardens in Edinburgh.[37] This work was formative in his development of a regional planning model called the \"Valley Section\".This model illustrated the complex interactions among biogeography, geomorphology and human systems and attempted to demonstrate how \"natural occupations\" such as hunting, mining, or fishing are supported by physical geographies that in turn determine patterns of human settlement.[38] The point of this model was to make clear the complex and interrelated relationships between humans and their environment, and to encourage regional planning models that would be responsive to these conditions.[39]/nGeddes developed a means for engaging with the populace of a city through a civic pageant. One such was the Masque of Learning, a pageant he organised in the Poole's Synod Hall, Edinburgh in 1912.[40] He also organised a pageant in Indore, India when he arrived in 1917.[41]/nGeddes' work in improving the slums of Edinburgh led to an invitation from Lord Pentland (then Governor of Madras) to travel to India to advise on emerging urban planning issues, in particular, how to mediate \"between the need for public improvement and respect for existing social standards\".[42] For this, Geddes prepared an exhibition on \"City and Town Planning\". The materials for the first exhibit were sent to India on a ship that was sunk near Madras by the German ship Emden, however new materials were collected and an exhibit prepared for the Senate hall of Madras University by 1915./nOnce arriving in India, Geddes toured multiple Indian cities and was overwhelmed by Indian architecture and planning. Geddes was impressed by the historical piety valued in Indian planning displayed by the seamless merger of traditional temples within the urban fabric of Indian cities. Geddes believed that this was indicative of a city's genius loci which is often established by a visually dominant building in a city like a medieval cathedral or an antique temple in the urban fabric. Geddes was outspoken in his town-planning reports about the \u201cinsensitivity of British colonial administration towards the historic Indian architecture and urban environment\u201d and denounced their methods of planning which included drastic and destructive changes to the urban fabric.[28]/nAccording to some reports, this was near the time of the meeting of the Indian National Congress and Pentland hoped the exhibit would demonstrate the benefits of British rule.[43] Geddes lectured and worked with Indian surveyors and travelled to Bombay and Bengal where Pentland's political allies Lord Willingdon and Lord Carmichael were Governors. He held a position in Sociology and Civics at Bombay University from 1919 to 1925.[28]/nBetween 1915 and 1919 Geddes wrote a series of \"exhaustive town planning reports\" on at least eighteen Indian cities, a selection of which has been collected together in Jacqueline Tyrwhitt\u2019s Patrick Geddes in India (1947)./nThrough these reports, Geddes was concerned to create a \"working system in India\", righting the wrongs of the past by making interventions in and plans for the urban fabric that were both considerate of local context and tradition and awake to the need for development. According to Lewis Mumford, writing in introduction to Tyrwhitt\u2019s collected reports:/n\"Few observers have shown more sympathy\u2026with the religious and social practices of the Hindus than Geddes did; yet no one could have written more scathingly of Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s attempt to conserve the past by reverting to the spinning wheel, at a moment when the fundamental poverty of the masses in India called for the most resourceful application of the machine both to agricultural and industrial life.\"[44]/nHis principles for town planning in Bombay demonstrate his views on the relationship between social processes and spatial form, and the intimate and causal connections between the social development of the individual and the cultural and physical environment. They included: (\"What town planning means under the Bombay Town Planning Act of 1915\")[43]/nGeddes' exhortation to pay attention to the social and particular when attempting city renewal or resettlement remains relevant, particularly in light of the plans for slum resettlement and redevelopment ongoing in many Indian cities (see, e.g. Dharavi redevelopment program):/n\"Town Planning is not mere place-planning, nor even work planning. If it is to be successful it must be folk planning. This means that its task is not to coerce people into new places against their associations, wishes, and interest, as we find bad schemes trying to do. Instead its task is to find the right places for each sort of people; place where they will really flourish. To give people in fact the same care that we give when transplanting flowers, instead of harsh evictions and arbitrary instructions to 'move on', delivered in the manner of an officious policeman.\"[45]/nGeddes worked with his son-in-law, the architect Frank Mears, on a number of projects in Palestine. In 1919, he designed a plan for the Hebrew University of Jerusalem at the request of the psychoanalyst, Dr. David Eder, who headed the World Zionist Organization's London Branch.[46][47][48] He also submitted a report on Jerusalem Actual and Possible to the Military Governor of Jerusalem in November 1919.[49][50] In 1925 he submitted a report on town planning in Jaffa and Tel Aviv to the Municipality of Tel Aviv, then led by Meir Dizengoff.[51] The municipality adopted his proposals and Tel Aviv is the only city whose core is entirely laid out according to a plan by Geddes./nGeddes' ideas had worldwide circulation: his most famous admirer was the American urban theorist Lewis Mumford who claimed that \"Geddes was a global thinker in practice, a whole generation or more before the Western democracies fought a global war\".[44]/nGeddes also influenced several British urban planners (notably Raymond Unwin and Frank Mears), the Indian social scientist Radhakamal Mukerjee and the Catalan architect Cebri\u00e0 de Montoliu (1873\u20131923) as well as many other 20th-century thinkers.[52]/nGeddes was keenly interested in the science of ecology, an advocate of nature conservation and strongly opposed to environmental pollution. Because of this, some historians have claimed he was a forerunner of modern Green politics.[53]/nResearchers at the Geddes Institute for Urban Research at the University of Dundee continue to develop Geddesian approaches to questions of city and regional planning and questions of social and psychical well-being in the built environment. In late 2015 the University staged an exhibition of Geddes' work in the Lamb Gallery, drawn from the Archives of the Universities of Dundee, Strathclyde, and Edinburgh, to mark the centenary of the publication of Cities in Evolution.[54]", "66670843": "Ronald Whittam FRS (21 March 1925 \u2013 16 August 2023) was an English research scientist in the field of cell physiology.

In the first two years he conducted research as scientific research staff of the Medical Research Unit.[20][21][16][18] Whittam proved the pacemaker effect of the sodium pump on metabolism with red blood cells.[22] He spent over half of 1958 at Columbia University, New York, working with David Nachmansohn on electrophysiology with single cell electroplaques and the electric eel.[3] Whittam discovered how much potassium is released from a cell of a mammalian.[23][24][25]  In 1960 he became a Lecturer in the Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, joining New College, yet also made a member of the Senior Common Room at Hertford College.[1] He was a moderator for exams in physiology having been asked by Professor Sir Lindor Brown, the Waynflete Professors of Physiology.[3] A real advance in physiology was made by Whittam in 1962 when he had three Papers published: Spatial asymmetry in the stimulation of a membrane adenosine triphosphatases; the asymmetrical stimulation of a membrane adenosine triphosphatase in relation to active cation transport and directional effects of the alkali metal ions on adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis in erythrocyte ghosts. This research was referred to by The Royal Society upon Whittam being elected a Fellow, \"Ronald Whittam conducted important studies of the mechanism of active transport of ions in animal tissues. He demonstrated the special asymmetry of the ATPase of the red blood cell membrane, which acts only when Na+ is inside and K+ is outside the membrane.

Lowe-McConnell received no support from any fisheries research organisations for this survey and relied heavily on local fishermen for assistance with her research.  As a result of these studies, Lowe-McConnell produced a valuable account of the tilapia fishery that formed a basis for subsequent investigation into Malawian cichlids. In the survey, Lowe-McConnell identified five tilapiine species, as well as studied other economically viable fish, including Labeo mesops.[2]/nIn 1948, Lowe-McConnell studied as a Research Officer in the British Overseas Research Service on the Ugandan shores of Lake Victoria.[5] Here, she helped found the East African Fisheries Research Organisation and briefly served as its Acting Director.[2]  Her research again focused again on tilapia as a potential fisheries species.[5]  During this time, she assisted many researchers, including Hugh Cott on his crocodile studies and Humphry Greenwood in his research on haplochromine cichlids.[2]  Lowe-McConnell's research during this period served as a foundation for later assessments of the impact fishing and other human activities have on food fishes.[2]/nAfter she married the geologist Richard McConnell on December 31, 1953, she was required to resign from the British Colonial Service due to the organization's marriage bar.[5][4]  This rule prevented the permanent employment of a married woman in the British Public Service.[6]/nSoon after their wedding, the McConnells moved to the Bechuanaland Protectorate, where their joint research focused on Botswanan natural history. During this time, Lowe-McConnell was appointed as the ichthyologist on the R.V. Cape St Mary to conduct marine fieldwork on the unexplored Guiana shelf.  She also developed her Okavango fish collection, now housed in the Natural History Museum, London.  In 1955, she described four new species and subspecies of tilapias in Lake Jipe and the Pangani River.[2]/nIn 1957, Richard became director of the Geological Survey in British Guiana and Lowe-McConnell provided research support.  She was also hired by the Guiana Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to conduct fish surveys in unstudied areas, which provided a foundation for studying the diverse and ecologically complex Rupununi fish communities.[5]  Her 1959 paper on the differences between tilapia species served as the basis for Ethelwynn Trewavas' division of tilapiine fish genera.[2]/nWhen Richard retired in 1962, the McConnells moved back to England, where Lowe-McConnell joined the Natural History Museum, London as an Associate.  While at the museum, Lowe-McConnell worked closely with Ethelwynn Trewavase on their extensive collections and global research.[5]  In 1968, Lowe-McConnell was appointed as ichthyologist on the Royal Society of London/Royal Geographical Society Xavantina Cachimbo Expedition to northeastern Mato Grosso, Brazil.[2]  She traveled to Gatun Lake in Panam\u00e1 in 1979 to assist Thomas Zaret in studying the impact of an introduced cichla species.[6]/nLowe-McConnell was widely known as a leader in her field and engaged with numerous international conferences, projects, and publications.[5]  Her work was requested by global organizations, including the Food and Agriculture Organization, United Nations Development Programme, and the International Center of Living Aquatic Resources Management.

He laid the foundation for research and teaching in marine biology and oceanography in Israel. In 1968 he founded the Marine Biology Laboratory of the Hebrew University near Eilat, serving as its first director. He also served as a founding member of the Zoological Society of Israel and a co-founder of the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel./nHeinz Steinitz was born in Breslau, Germany (now Wroclaw, Poland) on April 26, 1909, to Walter Steinitz (1882-1963), a cardiologist and zoologist, and Marta Schindler Steinitz (1885-1926).[1] He grew up in Breslau and was greatly inspired by his father to study science and to be an active Zionist. He studied medicine from 1927 to 1933 in the universities of Breslau, Freiburg and Berlin.[2] Although he passed the Medical Board examination in 1933, and would have started work in a hospital in Berlin and in the Jewish hospital in Breslau, he was prohibited from practicing by the Nazi regime which came to power that same year.[3] Together with his wife Ruth Aber Steinitz (1907-1995), a medical student as well, he left Germany in 1933 and immigrated to Palestine.[1]/nThree sons were born to Heinz Steinitz and Dr. Ruth Steinitz. Each turned to sciences: Raphael Steinitz, an astrophysicist, is a Professor Emeritus at the Department of Physics, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be\u2019er Sheba; Gideon Steinitz, a senior geologist, was the former Head of the Geological Survey of Israel, Jerusalem; and Benjamin Steinitz, a plant scientist retired as  a senior research scientist in the fields of plant physiology and horticulture at the Institute of Plant Sciences, Agricultural Research Organization, The Volcani Center, Rishon LeZion.[1]/nHeinz Steinitz died suddenly from a stroke on April 28, 1971, while being fully active in all positions he held at that time./nUnable to get in 1933 a permit from the British administration in Palestine to practice as a physician, Heinz Steinitz turned to earn his living in an agricultural research station located in Rehovot (and later in Petah Tikva).[3] That work marked the moment he changed his path from medicine to zoology.  His research on the control of citrus pests, under the supervision of Prof. F. S. Bodenheimer,[4] eventually became the experimental basis for his doctoral thesis. In 1938, Steinitz was the first to obtain a Ph.D. degree in zoology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and he took his place in the founders and pioneers of zoology in Israel.[3]/nHe became a member of the teaching and research staff of the Department of Zoology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1936, advanced along the academic track up to the highest degree of full professor, and worked in the department until his death.[5] The Hebrew University, the first university in Israel, was established only a decade before Steinitz's arrival in Jerusalem; thus, his academic career parallels the early history of zoology research and teaching in the Israeli academia./nIn the first decade of his career, including the years of World War II, he acted in the department as a teaching and research assistant, and concurrently, during 1943\u20131946, he lectured zoology at the Kibbutzim College of Education.[2]/nAppointed lecturer in 1946, he instructed animal histology, anatomy of livestock animals and laboratory animals. During the Arab-Israeli War (1948-1949) he served in a preventive healthcare military unit, teaching medical students recruited to army service.[2][3] \nAs a consequence of that war, the campus of the Hebrew University on Mount Scopus became an enclave in the Jordanian kingdom, disconnected from the western part of a divided Jerusalem. The university relocated its faculties to west Jerusalem. The zoology department, excluded from the new Givat Ram campus constructed in the 1950s, resided in buildings on different sites in the western city. Steinitz was active in reorganizing the department's function under the new circumstances and took care of the zoological collections moved from Mount Scopus to west Jerusalem. His office and labs migrated over the years. At first they were in the Terra Sancta building in Rehavia, then in the St. Antonio Monastery building, across from the official residence of the President of Israel, and finally close to the Russian Compound in the center of west Jerusalem. \nIn 1951 Steinitz went to the US for two years as a research fellow at Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, where he conducted research in the field of experimental embryology.[3] By 1954 he was promoted to Assistant Professor, became Associate Professor in 1957, and was appointed in 1963 Chairman of Division A of the Department of Zoology in Jerusalem. He lectured in general zoology, vertebrates and invertebrates morphology, animal histology, experimental embryology and ecology. From the mid-1950s onwards, marine biology and marine ecology became core of his research interests. He was the first to teach marine biology, and by 1966 he headed the development of the marine biology curriculum and research programs. In 1968, being Chairman of the Department of Zoology, he was appointed Full Professor.[5]/nSteinitz supervised masters and doctoral students, some of whom became senior scientists in fields of biology and environmental sciences in universities, research institutes, colleges and teacher colleges around the country. He believed in the importance of teaching and education at all levels, including preparing students to be school teachers. In this context, in the years 1957-1960 he was board member of the School of Education of the Hebrew University.[2]/nHeinz Steinitz was an ichthyologist, herpetologist, and marine biologist. He researched the ecology, distribution and evolution of amphibians and fresh water fish in the Middle East; the ecology, distribution and taxonomy of fish in the Red Sea; the ecology of the southeast Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea.[2][5][6] Other research interests included experimental embryology, neurohistology, and anatomical microscopy of the amphibian eye.[7] Geographically, his studies were conducted along the Syrian-African Great Rift valley, from Lake Hula and Lake Kinneret (The Sea of Galilee) in the north of Israel, through the Dead Sea in the center of the country, down to the Gulf of Eilat and the Red Sea in the south. Other parts of his work were carried out in the south east Mediterranean Basin and along the coasts of the Sinai Peninsula.[3][5][6] His research concerned taxonomy, anatomy, zoogeographic distribution and ecology of the fauna investigated./nTogether with his colleague Dr. Heinrich Mendelssohn, then at the Biological-Pedagogical Institute and later Professor at the Department of Zoology at Tel Aviv University, he explored the fauna of Lake Hula and its surrounding swamps.[8] In 1940, the two researchers discovered the rare Hula painted frog (Latonia nigriventer), the only living member of the genus Latonia, an amphibian endemic to the Hula marshes.[9] Lake Hula and its marshland were drained in the 1950s. The frog, considered to be extinct for about half a century due to the destruction of its habitat, was rediscovered in 2011. It is considered a living fossil, and it is included in the list of endangered species.[10] Steinitz also explored fish species living in the unique ecological niche of Ein Feshkha.[11][12] This site \u2014 the deepest continental point on Earth \u2014 is a saline wetland in the desert, on the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea, nourished by a spring of brackish water. Fish in this special habitat evolved isolated from fish populating other habitats./nOn a first study of the southeast Mediterranean Basin, published in 1947 jointly with Prof. Georg Haas, they observed fish of Indo-Pacific origin.[13] Later, Steinitz published dozens of papers on fish, the fauna and the ecology of the southeast Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. In 1967, together with Dr. William Aron from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, Steinitz launched a joint program on the role of the Suez Canal as a waterway for the passage of marine species between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.[6]/nAfter Steinitz's death in 1971, the survey and monitoring of the invasion of biota from the Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea (and to a smaller extent biota migration in the opposite direction) proliferated, and it continues into the 21st century.[14][15][16] The phenomenon of the continuous flow of marine biota across the Suez Canal is termed Lessepsian migration. To this day, hundreds species native to the Red Sea have been identified in the Mediterranean Sea, and probably others are yet unidentified. This human-mediated invasion has significantly impacted the Mediterranean ecosystem and endangered many local and endemic Mediterranean species.[17]/nSteinitz carried out research on a number of fish families, among them the Blenniidae, Cichlidae and Cyprinodontidae . He published nearly sixty papers in his different research fields, including on the discovery of fish new to science like the Kinneret-Sardine Acanthobrama terraesanctae, Garra Barreimiae (together with Henry Weed Fowler), and Tristramella sacra intermedia (together with A. Ben-Tuvia). Some of his publications appeared in special platforms he initiated and edited like the Contributions to the Knowledge of the Red Sea, Israel South Red Sea Expedition Scientific Reports, and Contributions to the Knowledge of Lake Tiberias. Together with Otto Haim Oren he published a Regional Bibliography of the Mediterranean coast of Israel and the adjacent Levant countries and Bibliography on Lake Kinnereth (Lake Tiberias)./nParallel to research and teaching at the university, Steinitz was involved in three types of research-supporting long term pursuits: (a) Participation, organization and management of scientific expeditions; (b) building-up and curation of a fish collection; (c) planning, founding and managing a marine research station near Eilat./nIn his earliest expeditions, in 1938\u20131940, Steinitz explored the fauna of Lake Hula and its surrounding marshland. Immediately following the outbreak of the Suez Crisis of 1956, Steinitz organized and headed an expedition examining the marine fauna along the Red Sea coasts of the Sinai Peninsula and the Suez Canal. In 1962 he led the first Israeli South Red Sea Expedition (ISRSE) which was based on the islands of the Dahlak Archipelago of Eritrea.[18] The ISRSE was part of the first International Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE) from 1962 to 1965. It was an interdisciplinary marine sciences research effort to survey the south Red Sea and to collect biological specimens and data from the region. Otto Haim Oren from the Haifa Sea Fishery Research Station and Lev Fishelson from the Tel Aviv University, both at that time doctoral students of Steinitz, assisted in organizing the project. The expedition team included a crew of researchers from universities and research institutes in Israel, as well as scientists from the Netherlands, USA and Ethiopia.[18]/nThe fish collection of the Hebrew University was begun in the 1920s by Prof. Israel Aharoni and Prof. Georg Haas, soon after the opening of the Department of Zoology.[19] Steinitz added specimens from the very beginning of his work in the department. During the 1950s, the collection of fish specimens was carried out also by Prof. Adam Ben-Tuvia from the Sea Fishery Research Station in Haifa, a former student of Steinitz. A considerable augmentation of the collection occurred with the harvest of the expeditions to Sinai in 1956 and the Israeli South Red Sea Expeditions in the 1960s, when over 3,000 lots of fish were deposited. The taxonomic and zoogeographic identification of specimens was often conducted by correspondence between Steinitz and ichthyologists and curators of research institutes and science museums around the world. As a consequence, the collection became recognized as having major international importance, serving as a reference collection for the international community of ichthyologists.[18][19]/nThe formative years of Steinitz's career took place under the difficult conditions prevailing in any budding university, compounded with the instability of the wars which accompanied the resurrection of the state of Israel. Steinitz pursued connections and collaborations with the international community of scientists in order to ensure that research in Israel met the highest standards\u2014a goal of critical importance for himself, the university, and the country. Furthermore, he realized that connections with colleagues from foreign countries would diminish the limits and disadvantages inherent in working in a small local scientific community geographically removed from global science centers. The wide and branched connections he wove over many years with scientists worldwide helped him to form a sound basis for what was, at that time, the early days of marine biology, oceanography, and ichthyology in Israel.[20]/nA special facet of Steinitz's international activities was building-up contacts and collaborations with West Germany's scientists, institutions and organizations. He commenced doing so years prior to the establishment, in 1965, of diplomatic relations between Germany and Israel. In 1946, working on the fish collection, he exchanged information and biological material with the German zoologist and geneticist Curt Kosswig. Prof. Kusswig emigrated in 1937 from Nazi Germany to Turkey, where he established the Department of Zoology at the Istanbul University. He returned to West Germany in 1955, was appointed head of the Zoological Institute and the Zoological Museum of the University of Hamburg, and visited Steinitz at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. From the early 1960s Steinitz was invited several times to visit as a guest professor at the University of Hamburg and other German universities. He also visited and tied connections with museums of science, zoological museums and marine biology research stations in West Germany. He became acquainted with Dr. G\u00fcnther B\u00f6hnecke, an oceanographer who played a central role after World War II in rehabilitating Germany's scientific relationships with countries worldwide. Dr. B\u00f6hnecke was an advisor to the German Research Foundation, the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), in the field of oceanography. The personal acquaintance and mutual appreciation between Steinitz and B\u00f6hnecke led to the support by the DFG for building and operating a marine biology laboratory near Eilat./nDoctor Walter Steinitz, father of Heinz Steinitz, published in 1919 his vision and proposal to establish a marine biology research station on the Mediterranean coast of Palestine.[21] The Hebrew University, and scholars in Palestine and in other countries, supported the plans of the project, but attempts to raise funds for it failed.  Inspired by his father's vision, Heinz Steinitz resumed the effort to carry out the concept.  However, he decided in the 1950s that the station would be better situated if it were built on the coast of the Red Sea, in the Gulf of Eilat (Gulf of Aqaba). He had three reasons for this preferred location: (a) Being by that time knowledgeable about the marine life in both the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, Heinz Steinitz recognized the higher richness and the notable biodiversity of the latter, which still remained widely uninvestigated. (b) First reports about the presence of fishes of Indo-Pacific origin in the eastern Mediterranean Sea began to appear in the beginning of the twentieth century. Indo-Pacific fishes were also observed along the coast of Palestine for the first time by Walter Steinitz.[22]  The findings were indicative for intrusion of alien fishes into the eastern Mediterranean Sea via the Suez Canal that was constructed and opened only several decades prior to those first observations. Heinz Steinitz believed that a research base in the Golf of Eilat would be best placed to conduct investigations into the phenomenon of migration of marine biota from the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea (a northern branch of the Indian Ocean) through the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean Sea. Furthermore, a marine station in the Gulf of Eilat would facilitate analysis of the environmental and ecological changes resulting from man-made connection between the two global water bodies. (c) Polluting spills from the cities of Eilat and Aqaba into the Gulf waters, and pollutants discharged by ships and oil tankers that traffic along the Red Sea and cross the Suez Canal, constituted environmental perils.[23] The marine research station staff in Eilat would be able to monitor impacts of anthropogenic activities on ecological processes and on the very sensitive marine ecosystems of the region./nIn preparation for the construction of the marine research station, Steinitz visited during the 1950s and the 1960s dozens of oceanographic research stations and marine aquariums in Europe, the US and in the Caribbean Islands in order to learn from other's experience managing such facilities. Since the Gulf of Eilat is in the geographical periphery of Israel and remote from any academic center, and considering that the Israeli nucleus of marine biologists was at that time still very small, Steinitz developed relationships with colleagues abroad and convinced them to come and conduct some of their research in the planned station. He also reinforced the local station's research and management staff with an international scientific advisory board of oceanographers from Europe, Australia and the US in order to strengthen and sustain the nascent activity.[24] In this way he guaranteed that the laboratory, from its inception, would be run at levels meeting international standards./nSteinitz received support and collaboration for his initiative from colleagues at other Israeli universities and research institutions, from the Israel Oceanographic and Limnology Research (IOLR) and from the German Research Foundation (DFG). The vision of Walter Steinitz was ultimately realized in 1968, five years after he died, when the Marine Biology Laboratory (MBL) of The Hebrew University near Eilat was inaugurated.[25] Launching the laboratory was a peak in the career of Heinz Steinitz as an Israeli zoologist and as an internationally recognized senior marine biologist. He died in 1971 while being the first director of the laboratory; in his honor, the laboratory was renamed The Heinz Steinitz Marine Biology Laboratory.[5]/nThe scientific activity in the station gained momentum soon after its inception, and under the leadership of its successive directors the research spread from marine biology to a wide scope of additional disciplines including chemical and physical oceanography, marine ecology and environmental quality. Supplemental buildings, new laboratories, teaching spaces and lecture halls were constructed. Israel's Council for Higher Education decided in 1985 that the station would become an interuniversity institute, with the marine biology laboratory being an integral part of it. The Interuniversity Institute for Marine Sciences (IUI) near Eilat became a national facility shared by all universities in Israel, The Weizmann Institute of Science and The Technion (Israel Institute of Technology)./nHeinz Steinitz was active in ex-university professional forums and organizations, some of them of national importance./nJointly with Prof. Georg Haas and Dr. O. Hecht, he founded in 1936 the Zoological Society of Israel.[3]/nIn the 1940s plans were advanced to drain Lake Hula and its swamps. Being concerned about the potential ecological detrimental consequences, Steinitz opposed these plans. After the establishment of the state of Israel (1948), with the fast growing population, settling the country, and the rapidly growing economy, he became troubled about carelessness lack of attention to the value of nature, the danger of loss of wild fauna and flora, and the destruction of local natural resources. In 1953, together with Azaria Alon, Prof. Heinrich Mendelssohn, Prof. Amotz Zahavi, and others, he co-founded the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel (SPNI), a non-profit environmental organization working to preserve plants, animals, open spaces, and natural environments that represent biodiversity./nSteinitz was appointed to a number of governmental forums and assigned to national tasks by different Ministries:/nLake Kinneret is the largest aboveground freshwater reservoir in Israel. The lake is fed mainly by the Jordan River down-flowing from Lake Hula and the Hula valley. Two development projects in the 1950s profoundly impacted the ecosystem of Lake Kinneret: (i) Lake Hula and its marshland were drained and dried, and the soil revealed was converted to farmland. Consequently, the mineral salts composition of the water entering into Lake Kinneret was altered significantly. (ii) A water carrier was constructed and great amounts of drinking water began to be pumped and conducted from Lake Kinneret to central and south Israel. Science-based sustainable management of the lake's water quantity and quality, including understanding of the lake's biota as part of its ecosystem, became necessary. Steinitz chaired a joint committee of Mekorot (the national water company of Israel and the country's top agency for water management) and Tahal (TAHAL Group, the major provider of infrastructure development water projects), coordinating multidisciplinary investigation of Lake Kinneret. In parallel, The Kinneret Limnological Laboratory as part of Israel Oceanographic Limnological Research was founded in 1968. Ensuing research of the physical, chemical, biological and environmental components of the lake's ecosystem continuously supports intelligent management of this important national freshwater resource.[26]/nIn 1965 Steinitz became member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, and of the Academy's committee publishing the Fauna of Israel./nHe was co-editor of the Bulletin of the Sea Fisheries Research Station in Haifa, and a board member of Bamidge, the journal of Israel's fishery research and development./nThe national and international reputation of Heinz Steinitz is reflected by names in his honor given to more than twenty newly discovered fishes, marine organisms and amphibians, listed in the Biographical Etymology of Marine Organism Names.[27] Some names were given years after he passed away./nThe fish species Tylognathus steinitziorum (discovered and named by Dr. Curt Kosswig in 1950, now called Hemigrammocapoeta nana) was dedicated to Walter Steinitz and his son Heinz Steinitz./nAnimal species named after Heinz Steinitz include:", "807207": "Gustav J\u00e4ger (June 23, 1832 \u2013 May 13, 1917) was a German naturalist and hygienist./nHe was born at the historic Pfarrhaus in the village of B\u00fcrg, Neuenstadt am Kocher in W\u00fcrttemberg. After studying medicine at T\u00fcbingen, he became a teacher of zoology in Vienna. In 1868, he was appointed professor of zoology at the academy of Hohenheim, and subsequently he became teacher of zoology and anthropology at Stuttgart Polytechnic and professor of physiology at the Veterinary School. In 1884, he abandoned teaching and started practice as a physician in Stuttgart. He wrote various works on biological subjects, including Die Darwinsche Theorie und ihre Stellung zu Moral und Religion (1869), and Lehrbuch der allgemeinen Zoologie (1871\u20131878).[1] J\u00e4ger was an early supporter of Darwinism.[2]/nIn 1876, he suggested a hypothesis in explanation of heredity, resembling the germ plasm theory subsequently elaborated by August Weismann, to the effect that the germinal protoplasm retains its specific properties from generation to generation, dividing in each reproduction into an ontogenetic portion, out of which the individual is built up, and a phylogenetic portion, which is reserved to form the reproductive material of the mature offspring.[1]/nIn Die Entdeckung der Seele[3] (\"The Discovery of The Soul\", 1878), J\u00e4ger advanced the first crude version of the pheromone concept. His postulated skin, \"anthropines,\" popularly dubbed as \"lust compounds,\" came astoundingly close to reality but the idea was too far ahead of the possibilities of chemistry and the life sciences at this time to be corroborated by experiments./nThe system of clothing associated with his name originates from Die Normalkleidung als Gesundheitsschutz[1] (\"Standardized Apparel For Health Protection\" (1880)), wherein he advocated the wearing of rough fabrics, such as wool, \"close to the skin,\" objecting especially to the use of any kind of plant fibre. The teachings of J\u00e4ger inspired the creation of the Jaeger clothing brand./nFrom the 1860s on, J\u00e4ger immersed himself in popularizing science through print media, associations, and the founding of a public aquarium and small zoo in Vienna.  In 1881, he founded his own magazine devoted to spreading his idea about health reform (Prof. Dr. G. J\u00e4gers Monatsblatt).[4]/nHe also was a very active entomologist specialising in beetles particularly Buprestidae and Scarabaeidae. He wrote with Carl Gustav Calwer K\u00e4ferbuch-Naturgeschichte der K\u00e4fer Europas (Beetle Book: Natural History of Europe's Beetles).

He used starch electrophoresis to reveal differences between normal human plasma proteins, and in collaboration with Norma Ford Walker, showed that the variation was inherited, which stimulated his interest in genetics.[10]/nWhile at the University of Wisconsin in the 1980s, Smithies developed gene targeting in mice, a method of replacing single mouse genes using homologous recombination. Mario Capecchi also developed the technique independently.[15][18] This research is the basis of methods used worldwide to investigate the role of particular genes in a wide range of human diseases including cancer, cystic fibrosis and diabetes.[19] In 2002, Smithies worked with his wife, Nobuyo Maeda, studying high blood pressure using genetically altered mice.[15]/nSmithies won the 2001 Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research, jointly with Martin Evans (Cardiff University) and Mario Capecchi (University of Utah), for their work on homologous recombination.[20] He received the Wolf Prize in Medicine, with Capecchi and Ralph L.

A second important line of investigation in the Filizola lab is on beta3 integrins towards the discovery of novel therapeutics to treat renal, hematologic, neoplastic, bone, and/or fibrotic diseases./nTo obtain rigorous mechanistic insight into the structure, dynamics, and function of GPCRs and beta3 integrins, the Filizola lab uses several computational structural biology tools, ranging from molecular modeling, bioinformatics, cheminformatics, molecular dynamics simulations, a variety of enhanced sampling algorithms, and rational drug design approaches.[19] Much of the work is done in close collaboration with major experimental labs with whom we have established longstanding synergistic ties./nDr. Filizola is the author of over 100 original papers and chapters in the areas of computational chemistry/biophysics and drug discovery,[20] as well as the editor of 2 books: \"G Protein-Coupled Receptors - Modeling and Simulation\"[21] and \"G Protein-Coupled Receptors in Drug Discovery\".[22] She is also an inventor, with a number of patents to her credit.[23]", "41963832": "Richard Penry Ambler (26 May 1933 \u2013 27 December 2013) was an English molecular biologist who conducted groundbreaking research into the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.[1] Ambler was the first scientist to publish an amino acid sequence of a bacterial protein, and had a long academic career at the University of Edinburgh.[1][2]/nAmbler was born on 26 May 1933 in Bexleyheath, London to Anne Evans, a civil servant, and Henry Ambler, a state-employed chemist.[2] In 1940, the family moved to Pune, India, where Ambler's father conducted wartime explosives research.[1] Ambler later returned to England to attend boarding school at Haileybury, before heading to Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1954 to study natural sciences.[2] He remained at Cambridge to complete his PhD on bacterial proteins, under the tutelage of the Nobel Prize-winning scientist Fred Sanger.[1] In 1963, Ambler published the first amino acid sequence of a bacterial protein, developing new methods of protein sequencing to determine the structure of the mitochondrial cytochrome c protein.[1] Cytochrome c remains an important object of study for modern biologists.[1]/nIn 1965, Ambler joined the newly created Department of Molecular Biology at the University of Edinburgh. He began a longstanding research project on the increasing resistance of certain bacteria to penicillin and other antibiotics, making important discoveries related to bacterial gene transfer and enzyme development.[1] In particular, Ambler found that horizontal gene transfer played a key role in the development of antibiotic resistance.[1]/nAmbler continued to sequence bacterial electron-transfer proteins, primarily Cytochrome C and Rubredoxin from photosynthetic and other bacteria throughout his career and made significant contributions to bacterial phylogenetics.  Ambler was particularly interested in the potential for the wider significance of horizontal gene transfer in evolution, influencing Carl Woese's later perspective./nHe headed the Department of Molecular Biology between 1984 and 1990, helping to reorganize it into more specialized sub-departments, and became a member of the European Molecular Biology Organisation in 1985.[2] He retired from the University of Edinburgh in the mid-1990s, and died in Edinburgh in December 2013.[2]/nAmbler was married twice, first to roboticist Pat Waddington and later to Susan Hewlett.

At Chicago, Orr studied under Jerry Coyne.  He performed postdoctoral research at the University of California, Davis.[2]/nOrr is an evolutionary geneticist whose research focuses on the genetics of speciation and the genetics of adaptation, in particular on the genetic basis of hybrid sterility and inviability. How many genes cause reproductive isolation between species? What are the normal functions of these genes and what evolutionary forces drove their divergence? He studies these problems through genetic analysis of reproductive isolation between species of Drosophila./nIn his adaptation work, Orr is interested in theoretical rules or patterns that might characterize the population genetics of adaptation. He studies these patterns using both population genetic theory and experiment.[3]  His early work on Drosophila set the terms of much of the current research on speciation.[4]  Orr is said to be one of the few evolutionary biologists ever to have made fundamental contributions about how changes occur within lineages over time, and about how lineages split to result in new species.[5]/nHis book Speciation,[6] co-authored with Jerry Coyne, was hailed in Science as \"exceedingly well-written and persuasive\".[7] They consider that studying speciation is largely synonymous with studying reproductive isolation, and explore what we know about where, when, and how isolating barriers evolve. Following Ernst Mayr they argue that speciation usually occurs where populations are geographically isolated or allopatric. They present evidence for the primacy of natural and sexual selection over genetic drift in driving speciation. Signatures of positive selection on genes involved in postzygotic isolation and reproductive proteins as well as experimental evidence from both the lab and field connect adaptation and sexual selection to reproductive isolation. They also present evidence for the congruence of the Dobzhansky-Muller model for the evolution of postzygotic isolation with the genetics of hybrid incompatibilities in many natural systems. Results that support their conclusions in the book continue to be published.[8]/nOrr frequently reviews books that seek to link biological ideas to religion or philosophy - this aspect of his work was specifically cited in his appointment as Shirley Cox Kearns Professor.[9]/nHe believes that \"Good science demands two things: that you ask the right questions and that you get the right answers. Although science education focuses almost exclusively on the second task, a good case can be made that the first is both the harder and the more important. Getting Mendel's laws from Mendel's data may not be easy, but surely the hardest part is daring to ask Mendel's question: Despite all appearances to the contrary, might heredity obey simple laws?\".[10]/nOrr considers \"scientism, the view that all truths are ultimately scientific\" to be naive, hubristic and just plain wrong[11] and is generally critical of what he sees as unwarranted attempts to generalise or draw philosophical conclusions from scientific facts. He laments the popular trend whereby \"some pet theory gets elevated to its rightful place as 'the' way to think about evolution. But this longing to dress up biology in unusual new perspectives has, so far, yielded more book deals than results\".[10]/nHe is highly critical of William Dembski's 2002 book No Free Lunch suggesting that although the counterintuitive No Free Lunch theorems of computer science do indeed rule out the generation of specified complexity in a specific technical sense, this has nothing to do with Darwinism which is not trying to reach a pre-specified target,[12] and of Michael Behe's 1996 book Darwin's Black Box which he characterises as \"cleverly argued, biologically informed \u2014 and wrong\".[13] He concedes that there are biological systems which are irreducibly complex in Behe's sense but suggests that \"An irreducibly complex system can be built gradually by adding parts that, while initially just advantageous, become \u2014 because of later changes \u2014 essential\".[14] He also suggests that, while he has \"utter confidence in Behe's biochemistry\" Behe \"is not at home in the technical evolution literature.\"/nHowever he is also critical of Daniel Dennett,[15] Steven Pinker and Richard Dawkins,[16] expressing serious reservations about their arguments and defending these in extended follow-up correspondence.[17]/nOrr is not satisfied by Stephen Jay Gould's NOMA suggestion. Whilst highly critical of claims that physics has \"found God\" he points out that \"many of the [20th] century\u2019s leading scientists \u2013 including some of the brightest stars of evolutionary biology...were deeply religious... Theodosius Dobzhansky was a Christian and something of an amateur theologian; Sir Ronald Fisher was a deeply devout Anglican who, between founding modern statistics and population genetics, penned articles for church magazines; and J.B.S. Haldane was an unabashed mystic\".  Moreover, Orr thinks that Gould's redefinition of religion to be solely concerned with moral values is not what anyone who practices the thing means by religion (or almost anyone, anyway), and that it will not do to pretend that all will be well in some imagined world where people of goodwill pursue invariably consonant views. So whereas it may be that the road Gould cuts is in a sensible enough direction (a considerable improvement over the present state in which creationists pester scientists and scientists preach values, and avoiding many of the inanities that often accompany talk of religion by scientists) it is a far bumpier road than Gould lets on.[18]/nOrr has been the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, a David and Lucile Packard Fellowship, an Alfred P.

In 1975 he enrolled at Moscow State University's Faculty of Biology and studied there until 1977, when his father, Soviet dissident Valentin Turchin, was exiled from the Soviet Union. In 1980 Turchin received a B.A. (cum laude) in biology from New York University, and in 1985 a Ph.D. in zoology  from Duke University.[2]/nThroughout his career Turchin has made contributions to various fields, such as economic history and historical dynamics. He is one of the founders of cliodynamics, the scientific discipline at the intersection of historical macrosociology, cliometrics, and mathematical modeling of social processes. Turchin developed an original theory explaining how large historical empires evolve by the mechanism of multilevel selection.[4] His research on secular cycles[5] has contributed to our understanding of the collapse of complex societies as has his re-interpretation of Ibn Khaldun's notion of asabiyya as \"collective solidarity\".[6][7]/nOne of Turchin's most prominent fields of research is his study of the hypothesis that population pressure causes increased warfare. Turchin, in collaboration with Korotayev, has shown that negative results do not falsify the population-warfare hypothesis.[5] Population and warfare are dynamical variables. If their interaction causes sustained oscillations, then we do not in general expect to find strong correlation between the two variables measured at the same time (that is, unlagged). Turchin and Korotayev have explored mathematically what the dynamical patterns of interaction between population and warfare (focusing on internal warfare) might be in stateless and state societies. Next, they tested the model predictions in several empirical case studies: early modern England, Han and Tang China, and the Roman Empire. Their empirical results have supported the population-warfare theory: Turchin and Korotayev have found that there is a tendency for population numbers and internal warfare intensity to oscillate with the same period but shifted in phase (with warfare peaks following population peaks). Furthermore, they have demonstrated that the rates of change of the two variables behave precisely as predicted by the theory: population rate of change is negatively affected by warfare intensity, while warfare rate of change is positively affected by population density.[5]/nIn 2010 Turchin published research using 40 combined social indicators to predict that there would be worldwide social unrest in the 2020s.[8][9] He subsequently cited the success of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign as evidence that \"negative trends seem to be accelerating\" and that there has been an \"unprecedented collapse of social norms governing civilized discourse\".[10] In 2020, Turchin and Jack Goldstone predicted that political and civic unrest in the United States would continue regardless of the party in power until a leader took action to reduce inequality and improve the social indicators that are tracked in their research.[11]/nTurchin has published over 200 scientific articles (including more than a dozen in Nature, Science, or PNAS) and at least eight books.

He was one of those who regarded facial expressions and gestures as a precursor of human writing skills. In brief, his thesis was that the abilities to read and write are biologically older than those of language, because such visual communication was later supplemented by vocal and acoustic signals./nIn the late eighties and the nineties he was one of those who raised the alarm about the depletion of tropical rain forests. From 2000 Niemitz developed an \"amphibious\" theory of the evolution of upright human posture and walking erect, according to which \"there was a period in our evolution when it was wading and shore use which in a sustained and substantial way helped to shape today's people\".[2] Niemitz rejects the more extensive aquatic ape hypothesis, which accepts a real aquatic (water living) phase in human evolution.[3] His publication list includes over 350 titles and many books.

She confirmed this observation by hydrolyzing the coenzyme into adenylic acid and \u0392-alanine and thereby demonstrating that the vitamin pantothenic acid was a part of the coenzyme; this work was published with Lipmann, Nathan Kaplan, Constance Tuttle, and G. David Novelli in 1947.[15] A second publication provided more details on how to prepare coenyzme A with details on its vitamin content and structure.[16] Later, Kaplan detailed Guirard's experiments and noted her repeated investigations into the samples she received, and how it was only through her extended curiosity that she was able to identify the presence of pantothenic acid within conenzyme A.[17] Lipmann also describes Guirard's expertise in finding pantothenic acid in tissue extracts, and how this led to the observation that an enzyme removed pantothenic acid from coenzyme A.[18] In 1953, Lipmann reviewed the chemistry and function of coenyzme A and he noted it was 'through [Guirard]'s skillful observations that pantothenic acid was detected in the coenzyme\".[19]/nGuirard was a long-time associate of Esmond Emerson Snell, and was a part of the team that discovered the different forms of vitamin B6.[6][20][21] Her work in this realm included investigations into enzymes including ornithine decarboxylase[22] and histidine decarboxylase.[23][24][25] She established the amino acids,[26] vitamins,[27] or combination of amino acids and vitamins required for microbial growth.[28][29] She also used microbial growth as an assay to determine the effectiveness of anti-tumor agents,[30] and examined the role of polyamines such as spermine and spermidine on cell growth.[31]/nThe Beverly Guirard endowment at the University Catholic Center in Austin, Texas was established in honor of Guirard.[32][33]", "64967025": "Laura K.

This discovery provided insight into mathematical nature of human perception by suggesting that the visual cortex is capable of computing a large number of autocorrelations in parallel.[12]/nDavid Marr first coined the term \"Glass patterns\" in his 1982 work on visual perception,[13] resulting in an increased interest in the phenomenon. Because of their mathematical simplicity and physiological underpinnings, Glass patterns have subsequently been used in dozens of electrophysiology and visual psychophysics experiments, resulting in additional understanding of the physiology of visual perception.[11]/nGlass may be best known for his work with colleagues at McGill University, suggesting that certain physiological disorders may be considered dynamical diseases. These are characterized by sudden changes in the qualitative dynamics of a physiological control mechanism, which leads to disease. These features are illustrated in the Mackey-Glass equations.[14][15] According to James Gleick, who recounted conversations with Glass in his book Chaos: Making a New Science, foundational work in chaos by the McGill group was performed using animal models.[16] He quotes Glass saying: \"Many different rhythms can be established between a stimulus and a little piece of chicken heart\".[16] Since the initial description of dynamical diseases, a large number of researchers have analyzed mathematical models of physiological systems. Examples of dynamical diseases have been described in medical fields as diverse as hematology, cardiology, neurology, and psychiatry.[17][18] Dynamical disease modeling has been used to understand cardiac arrhythmia, and specific model detection algorithms are now being programmed into pacemakers so that pathological patterns can be detected and corrected.[19]/nBooks/nSelected articles", "21811584": "Sir Richard Owen KCB FRMS FRS (20 July 1804 \u2013 18 December 1892) was an English biologist, comparative anatomist and paleontologist. Owen is generally considered to have been an outstanding naturalist with a remarkable gift for interpreting fossils./nOwen produced a vast array of scientific work, but is probably best remembered today for coining the word Dinosauria (meaning \"Terrible Reptile\" or \"Fearfully Great Reptile\").[2][3] An outspoken critic of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, Owen agreed with Darwin that evolution occurred but thought it was more complex than outlined in Darwin's On the Origin of Species.[4] Owen's approach to evolution can be considered to have anticipated the issues that have gained greater attention with the recent emergence of evolutionary developmental biology.[5]/nOwen was the first president of the Microscopical Society of London in 1839 and edited many issues of its journal \u2013 then known as The Microscopic Journal.[6] Owen also campaigned for the natural specimens in the British Museum to be given a new home. This resulted in the establishment, in 1881, of the now world-famous Natural History Museum in South Kensington, London.[7] Bill Bryson argues that, \"by making the Natural History Museum an institution for everyone, Owen transformed our expectations of what museums are for.\"[8]/nWhile he made several contributions to science and public learning, Owen was a controversial figure among his contemporaries, both for his disagreements on matters of common descent, and for accusations that he took credit for other people's work./nOwen became a surgeon's apprentice in 1820 and was appointed to the Royal College of Surgeons in 1826.[9] In 1836, Owen was appointed Hunterian professor at the Royal College, and in 1849, he succeeded William Clift as conservator of the Hunterian Museum. He held the latter office until 1856, when he became superintendent of the natural history department of the British Museum. He then devoted much of his energies to a great scheme for a National Museum of Natural History, which eventually resulted in the removal of the natural history collections of the British Museum to a new building at South Kensington: the British Museum (Natural History) (now the Natural History Museum). He retained office until the completion of this work, in December 1883, when he was made a knight of the Order of the Bath.[10]/nOwen always tended to support orthodox men of science and the status quo. The royal family presented him with the cottage in Richmond Park and Robert Peel put him on the Civil List. In 1843, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1844 he became an associated member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands. When this Institute became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1851, he joined as foreign member.[11] In 1845, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.[12]/nHe died at home on 15 December 1892 and is buried in the churchyard at St Andrew's Church, Ham, near Richmond, Surrey.[13]/nWhile occupied with the cataloguing of the Hunterian collection, Owen did not confine his attention to the preparations before him but also seized every opportunity to dissect fresh subjects. He was allowed to examine all animals that died in London Zoo's gardens and, when the Zoo began to publish scientific proceedings, in 1831, he was the most prolific contributor of anatomical papers. His first notable publication, however, was his Memoir on the Pearly Nautilus (London, 1832), which was soon recognized as a classic. Thenceforth, he continued to make important contributions to every department of comparative anatomy and zoology for a period of over fifty years. In the sponges, Owen was the first to describe the now well-known Venus' Flower Basket or Euplectella (1841, 1857). Among Entozoa, his most noteworthy discovery was that of Trichina spiralis (1835), the parasite infesting the muscles of man in the disease now termed trichinosis (see also, however, Sir James Paget). Of Brachiopoda he made very special studies, which much advanced knowledge and settled the classification that has long been accepted. Among Mollusca, he described not only the pearly nautilus but also Spirula (1850) and other Cephalopoda, both living and extinct, and it was he who proposed the universally-accepted subdivision of this class into the two orders of Dibranchiata and Tetrabranchiata (1832). In 1852 Owen named Protichnites \u2013 the oldest footprints found on land.[14] Applying his knowledge of anatomy, he correctly postulated that these Cambrian trackways were made by an extinct type of arthropod,[14] and he did this more than 150 years before any fossils of the animal were found.[15][16] Owen envisioned a resemblance of the animal to the living arthropod Limulus.[14]/nMost of his work on reptiles related to the skeletons of extinct forms and his chief memoirs, on British specimens, were reprinted in a connected series in his History of British Fossil Reptiles (4 vols. London 1849\u20131884). He published the first important general account of the great group of Mesozoic land-reptiles, and he coined the name Dinosauria from Greek \u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 (deinos) \"terrible, powerful, wondrous\" + \u03c3\u03b1\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (sauros) \"lizard\".[2][3] Owen used 3 genera to define the dinosaurs: the carnivorous Megalosaurus, the herbivorous Iguanodon and armoured Hylaeosaurus', specimens uncovered in southern England.[3]/nWith Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins, Owen helped create the first life-size sculptures depicting dinosaurs as he thought they might have appeared. Some models were initially created for the Great Exhibition of 1851, but 33 were eventually produced when the Crystal Palace was relocated to Sydenham, in South London. Owen famously hosted a dinner for 21 prominent men of science inside the hollow concrete Iguanodon on New Year's Eve 1853. However, in 1849, a few years before his death in 1852, Gideon Mantell had realised that Iguanodon, of which he was the discoverer, was not a heavy, pachyderm-like animal, as Owen was proposing, but had slender forelimbs[17]/nOwen was granted right of first refusal on any freshly dead animal at the London Zoo. His wife once arrived home to find the carcass of a newly deceased rhinoceros in her front hallway.[8]/nAt the same time, Sir Thomas Mitchell's discovery of fossil bones, in New South Wales, provided material for the first of Owen's long series of papers on the extinct mammals of Australia, which were eventually reprinted in book-form in 1877. He described Diprotodon (1838) and Thylacoleo (1859), and extinct species kangaroos and wombats of gigantic size. Most fossil material found in Australia and New Zealand was initially sent to England for expert examination, and with the assistance of the local collectors Owen became the first authority on the palaeontology of the region.[18] While occupied with so much material from abroad, Owen was also busily collecting facts for an exhaustive work on similar fossils from the British Isles and, in 1844\u20131846, he published his History of British Fossil Mammals and Birds, which was followed by many later memoirs, notably his Monograph of the Fossil Mammalia of the Mesozoic Formations (Palaeont. Soc., 1871). One of his latest publications was a little work entitled Antiquity of Man as deduced from the Discovery of a Human Skeleton during Excavations of the Docks at Tilbury (London, 1884)./nSometime during the 1840s Owen came to the conclusion that species arise as the result of some sort of evolutionary process.[7] He believed that there were a total of six possible mechanisms: Parthenogenesis, prolonged development, premature birth, congenital malformations, Lamarckian atrophy, Lamarckian hypertrophy and transmutation,[7] of which he thought transmutation was the least likely.[7]/nScience historian Evelleen Richards has argued that Owen was likely sympathetic to developmental theories of evolution, but backed away from publicly proclaiming them after the critical reaction that had greeted the anonymously published evolutionary book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation in 1844 (it was revealed only decades later that the book had been authored by publisher Robert Chambers). Owen had been criticized for his own evolutionary remarks in his Nature of the Limbs in 1849.[19] At the end of On the Nature of Limbs[20] Owen suggested that humans ultimately evolved from fish, as the result of natural laws,[20] which resulted in Owen being criticized in the Manchester Spectator for denying that species such as humans were created by God.[7]/nDuring the development of Darwin's theory, his investigation of barnacles showed, in 1849, how their segmentation related to other crustaceans, showing how they had diverged from their relatives. To both Darwin and Owen such \"homologies\" in comparative anatomy were evidence of descent. Owen demonstrated fossil evidence of an evolutionary sequence of horses, as supporting his idea of development from archetypes in \"ordained continuous becoming\" and, in 1854, gave a British Association talk on the impossibility of bestial apes, such as the recently discovered gorilla, standing erect and being transmuted into men, but Owen did not rule out the possibility that humans had evolved from other extinct animals by evolutionary mechanisms other than transmutation./nWorking-class militants were trumpeting man's monkey origins.[citation needed] To crush these ideas, Owen, as President-elect of the Royal Association,[clarification needed] announced his authoritative anatomical studies of primate brains, claiming that the human brain had structures that apes brains did not, and that therefore humans were a separate sub-class, starting a dispute which was subsequently satirised as the Great Hippocampus Question. Owen's main argument was that humans have much larger brains for their body size than other mammals including the great apes.[4]/nDuring the reaction to Darwin's theory, Huxley's arguments with Owen continued. Owen tried to smear Huxley, by portraying him as an \"advocate of man's origins from a transmuted ape\" and one of his contributions to the Athenaeum was titled \"Ape-origin of man as tested by the brain\".[citation needed]/nIn 1862 (and later occasions) Huxley took the opportunity to arrange demonstrations of ape brain anatomy (e.g. at the BA meeting, where William Flower performed the dissection). Visual evidence of the supposedly missing structures (posterior cornu and hippocampus minor) was used, in effect, to indict Owen for perjury: Owen had argued that the absence of those structures in apes were connected with the lesser size to which the ape brains grew, but he then conceded that a poorly developed version might be construed as present without preventing him from arguing that brain size was still the major way of distinguishing apes and humans.[4]/nHuxley's campaign ran over two years and was devastatingly successful at persuading the overall scientific community, with each \"slaying\" being followed by a recruiting drive for the Darwinian cause. The spite lingered. While Owen had argued that humans were distinct from apes by virtue of having large brains, Huxley claimed that racial diversity blurred any such distinction. In his paper criticizing Owen, Huxley directly states:/nOwen countered Huxley by saying the brains of all human races were really of similar size and intellectual ability, and that the fact that humans had brains that were twice the size of large apes like male gorillas, even though humans had much smaller bodies, made humans distinguishable.[4]/nHe was the first director in Natural History Museum in London and his statue was in the main hall there until 2009, when it was replaced with a statue of Darwin.\nA bust of Owen by Alfred Gilbert (1896) is held in the Hunterian Museum, London./nA species of Central American lizard, Diploglossus owenii, was named in his honour by French herpetologists Andr\u00e9 Marie Constant Dum\u00e9ril and Gabriel Bibron in 1839.[22]/nThe Sir Richard Owen pub in central Lancaster is named in his honour,[23] and there is a blue plaque in his honour at Lancaster Royal Grammar School./nOwen has been described by some as a malicious, dishonest and hateful individual. He has been described in one biography as being a \"social experimenter with a penchant for sadism. Addicted to controversy and driven by arrogance and jealousy\". Deborah Cadbury stated that Owen possessed an \"almost fanatical egoism with a callous delight in savaging his critics.\" An Oxford University professor once described Owen as \"a damned liar. He lied for God and for malice\".[24] Gideon Mantell claimed it was \"a pity a man so talented should be so dastardly and envious\". Richard Broke Freeman described him as \"the most distinguished vertebrate zoologist and palaeontologist ... but a most deceitful and odious man\".[25] Charles Darwin stated that \"No one fact tells so strongly against Owen ... as that he has never reared one pupil or follower.\"[26]/nOwen famously credited himself and Georges Cuvier with the discovery of the Iguanodon, completely excluding any credit for the original discoverer of the dinosaur, Gideon Mantell. This was not the first or last time Owen would falsely claim a discovery as his own. It has also been suggested by some authors[27] that Owen even used his influence in the Royal Society to ensure that many of Mantell's research papers were never published. Owen was finally dismissed from the Royal Society's Zoological Council for plagiarism.[27]/nAnother reason for his criticism of the Origin, some historians claim, was that Owen felt upstaged by Darwin and supporters such as Huxley, and his judgment was clouded by jealousy. Owen in Darwin's opinion was/nOwen also resorted to the same subterfuge he used against Mantell, writing another anonymous article in the Edinburgh Review in April 1860.[29] In the article, Owen was critical of Darwin for not offering many new observations, and heaped praise (in the third person) upon himself, while being careful not to associate any particular comment with his own name.[30] Owen did praise, however, the Origin's description of Darwin's work on insect behavior and pigeon breeding as \"real gems\".[29]/nOwen was also a party to the threat to end government funding of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew botanical collection (see Attacks on Hooker and Kew), orchestrated by Acton Smee Ayrton:/nIt has been suggested by some authors that the portrayal of Owen as a vindictive and treacherous man was fostered and encouraged by his rivals (particularly Darwin, Hooker, and Huxley) and may be somewhat undeserved. In the first part of his career he was rightly regarded as one of the great scientific figures of the age. In the second part of his career his reputation fell./nOwen's lost scientific standing was not due solely to his underhanded dealings with colleagues; it was also due to serious errors of scientific judgement that were discovered and publicized. A fine example was his decision to classify man in a separate subclass of the Mammalia (see Man's place in nature). In this Owen had no supporters at all. Also, his unwillingness to come off the fence concerning evolution became increasingly damaging to his reputation as time went on. Owen continued working after his official retirement at the age of 79, but he never recovered the good opinions he had garnered in his younger days.[32][33]", "8409476": "Dirk Inz\u00e9 (born 19 October 1957) is a Belgian molecular biologist and professor at Ghent University (Ghent, Belgium).

He is considered one of the forerunners of sociobiology. Hamilton published important work on sex ratios and the evolution of sex. From 1984 to his death in 2000, he was a Royal Society Research Professor at Oxford University./nRichard Dawkins has written that Hamilton was \"the greatest Darwinian of my lifetime\".[3]/nHamilton was born in 1936 in Cairo, Egypt, the second of seven children. His parents were from New Zealand; his father A.M. Hamilton was an engineer, and his mother B.M. Hamilton was a physician. The Hamilton family settled in Kent. During the Second World War, Hamilton was evacuated to Edinburgh. He became interested in natural history at an early age and spent his spare time collecting butterflies and other insects. In 1946, he discovered E.B. Ford's New Naturalist book Butterflies, which introduced him to the principles of evolution by natural selection, genetics, and population genetics./nHe was educated at Tonbridge School, where he was in Smythe House. As a 12-year-old, he was seriously injured while playing with explosives his father had that were left over from making hand grenades for the Home Guard during World War\u00a0II. Hamilton had to have a thoracotomy and parts of fingers on his right hand had to be amputated in King's College Hospital to save his life. He was left with scarring and needed six months to recover./nBefore going up to the University of Cambridge, he travelled in France and completed two years of national service. As an undergraduate at St. John's College in Biology, he was uninspired by the \"many biologists [who] hardly seemed to believe in evolution\"./nHamilton enrolled in an MSc course in demography at the London School of Economics (LSE), under Norman Carrier, who helped secure grants for his studies. Later, when his work became more mathematical and genetical, he had his supervision transferred to John Hajnal of the LSE and Cedric Smith of University College London (UCL)./nBoth Fisher and J.\u00a0B.\u00a0S. Haldane had seen a problem in how organisms could increase the fitness of their own genes by aiding their close relatives, but not recognised its significance or properly formulated it. Hamilton worked through several examples, and eventually realised that the number that kept falling out of his calculations was Sewall Wright's coefficient of relationship. This became Hamilton's rule: in each behaviour-evoking situation, the individual assesses his neighbour's fitness against his own according to the coefficients of relationship appropriate to the situation.  Algebraically, the rule posits that a costly action should be performed if:/nwhere C is the cost in fitness to the actor, r the genetic relatedness between the actor and the recipient, and B is the fitness benefit to the recipient. Fitness costs and benefits are measured in fecundity. r is a number between 0 and 1. His two 1964 papers entitled The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour are now widely referenced.[4]/nThe proof and discussion of its consequences, however, involved detailed mathematics, and two reviewers passed over the paper. The third, John Maynard Smith, did not completely understand it either, but recognised its significance. Having his work passed over later led to friction between Hamilton and Maynard Smith, as Hamilton thought Maynard Smith had held his work back to claim credit for the idea (during the review period Maynard Smith published a paper that referred briefly to similar ideas). The Hamilton paper was printed in the  Journal of Theoretical Biology and, when first published, was largely ignored. Recognition of its significance gradually increased to the point that it is now routinely cited in biology books./nMuch of the discussion relates to the evolution of eusociality in insects of the order Hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps) based on their unusual haplodiploid sex-determination system. This system means that females are more closely related to their sisters than to their own (potential) offspring. Thus, Hamilton reasoned, a \"costly action\" would be better spent in helping to raise their sisters, rather than reproducing themselves./nThe supergenes notion (sometimes called the Green-beard effect) - that organisms may evolve genes that are able to identify identical copies in others and preferentially direct social behaviours towards them - was theoretically clarified and withdrawn by Hamilton in 1987.[5]/nIn his 1970 paper Selfish and Spiteful Behaviour in an Evolutionary Model Hamilton considers the question of whether harm inflicted upon an organism must inevitably be a byproduct of adaptations for survival.  What of possible cases where an organism is deliberately harming others without apparent benefit to the self?  Such behaviour Hamilton calls spiteful.  It can be explained as the increase in the chance of an organism's genetic alleles to be passed to the next generations by harming those that are less closely related than relationship by chance./nSpite, however, is unlikely ever to be elaborated into any complex forms of adaptation.  Targets of aggression are likely to act in revenge, and the majority of pairs of individuals (assuming a panmictic species) exhibit a roughly average level of genetic relatedness, making the selection of targets of spite problematic./nBetween 1964 and 1977, Hamilton was a lecturer at Imperial College London.[6] Whilst there he published a paper in Science on \"extraordinary sex ratios\". Fisher (1930) had proposed a model as to why \"ordinary\" sex ratios were nearly always 1:1 (but see Edwards 1998), and likewise extraordinary sex ratios, particularly in wasps, needed explanations. Hamilton had been introduced to the idea and formulated its solution in 1960 when he had been assigned to help Fisher's pupil A.W.F. Edwards test the Fisherian sex ratio hypothesis. Hamilton combined his extensive knowledge of natural history with deep insight into the problem, opening up a whole new area of research./nThe paper introduced the concept of the \"unbeatable strategy\", which John Maynard Smith and George R. Price were to develop into the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), a concept in game theory not limited to evolutionary biology. Price had originally come to Hamilton after deriving the Price equation, and thus rederiving Hamilton's rule. Maynard Smith later peer reviewed one of Price's papers, and drew inspiration from it. The paper was not published but Maynard Smith offered to make Price a co-author of his ESS paper, which helped to improve relations between the men. Price committed suicide in 1975, and Hamilton and Maynard Smith were among the few present at the funeral.[7]/nHamilton was a visiting professor at Harvard University and later spent nine months with the Royal Society's and the Royal Geographical Society's Xavantina-Cachimbo Expedition as a visiting professor at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo. From 1978 Hamilton was Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of Michigan. Simultaneously, he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[8] His arrival sparked protests and sit-ins from students who did not like his association with sociobiology. There he worked with the political scientist Robert Axelrod on the prisoner's dilemma, and was a member of the BACH group with original members Arthur Burks, Robert Axelrod, Michael Cohen, and John Holland.[9]/nHamilton was regarded as a poor lecturer. This shortcoming would not affect the recognition of his work, however, as it was popularised by Richard Dawkins in the book The Selfish Gene published in 1976./nHamilton was an early proponent of the Red Queen theory of the evolution of sex[10] (separate from the other theory of the same name previously proposed by Leigh Van Valen). This was named for a character in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass, who is continuously running but never actually travels any distance:/nThis theory hypothesizes that sex evolved because new and unfamiliar combinations of genes could be presented to parasites, preventing the parasite from preying on that organism: species with sex were able to continuously \"run away\" from their parasites. Likewise, parasites were able to evolve mechanisms to get around the organism's new set of genes, thus perpetuating an endless race./nIn 1980, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1984, he was invited by Richard Southwood to be the Royal Society Research Professor in the Department of Zoology at Oxford, and a fellow of New College, where he remained until his death./nHis collected papers, entitled Narrow Roads of Gene Land, began to be published in 1996.  The first volume was entitled Evolution of Social Behaviour./nThe field of social evolution, of which Hamilton's Rule has central importance, is broadly defined as being the study of the evolution of social behaviours, i.e. those that impact on the fitness of individuals other than the actor. Social behaviours can be categorized according to the fitness consequences they entail for the actor and recipient. A behaviour that increases the direct fitness of the actor is mutually beneficial if the recipient also benefits, and selfish if the recipient suffers a loss. A behaviour that reduces the fitness of the actor is altruistic if the recipient benefits, and spiteful if the recipient suffers a loss. This classification was first proposed by Hamilton in 1964.[citation needed]/nHamilton also proposed the coevolution theory of autumn leaf color as an example of evolutionary signalling theory.[11]/nDuring the 1990s, Hamilton became increasingly interested in the controversial argument that the origin of HIV lay in oral polio vaccine trials conducted by Hilary Koprowski in Africa during the 1950s. A letter by Hamilton on the topic to the major peer-reviewed journal Science was rejected in 1996.[12] Despite this rejection, he gave supportive declarations on the hypothesis to the BBC[13] and wrote the foreword of a 1999 book, The River, by journalist Edward Hooper, who investigated the hypothesis.[14] To look for indirect evidence of the OPV hypothesis by assessing natural levels of simian immunodeficiency virus in primates, in early 2000, Hamilton, grad student Michael Worobey, and another student Jeffrey Joy ventured on a field trip to the then-war-torn Democratic Republic of the Congo.[12][14][15] However, none of the over 60 urine and faecal samples collected by Hamilton contained detectable SIV virus.[16]/nHamilton returned to London from Africa on 29 January 2000. He was admitted to University College Hospital, London, on 30 January 2000. He was transferred to Middlesex Hospital on 5 February 2000 and died there on 7 March 2000. An inquest was held on 10 May 2000 at Westminster Coroner's Court to inquire into rumours about the cause of his death. The coroner concluded that his death was due to \"multi-organ failure due to upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage due to a duodenal diverticulum and arterial bleed through a mucosal ulcer\". Following reports attributing his death to complications arising from malaria, the BBC Editorial Complaints Unit's investigation established that he had contracted malaria during his final African expedition. However, the pathologist had suggested the possibility that the ulceration and consequent haemorrhage had resulted from a pill (which might have been taken because of malarial symptoms) lodging in the diverticulum; but, even if this suggestion were correct, the link between malaria and the observed causes of death would be entirely indirect.[17]/nA secular memorial service (he was an agnostic[18]) was held at the chapel of New College, Oxford on 1 July 2000, organised by Richard Dawkins. He was buried near Wytham Woods. He, however, had written an essay on My intended burial and why in which he wrote:[19]/nI will leave a sum in my last will for my body to be carried to Brazil and to these forests. It will be laid out in a manner secure against the possums and the vultures just as we make our chickens secure; and this great Coprophanaeus beetle will bury me. They will enter, will bury, will live on my flesh; and in the shape of their children and mine, I will escape death. No worm for me nor sordid fly, I will buzz in the dusk like a huge bumble bee. I will be many, buzz even as a swarm of motorbikes, be borne, body by flying body out into the Brazilian wilderness beneath the stars, lofted under those beautiful and un-fused elytra which we will all hold over our backs. So finally I too will shine like a violet ground beetle under a stone./nThe second volume of his collected papers, Evolution of Sex, was published in 2002, and the third and final volume, Last Words, in 2005./nIn 1966, he married Christine Friess; the couple had three daughters, Helen, Ruth, and Rowena.[20] They amicably separated 26 years later.[citation needed] From 1994, Hamilton found companionship with Maria Luisa Bozzi, an Italian science journalist and author.[20]/nHamilton started to publish his collected papers in 1996, along the lines of Fisher's collected papers, with short essays giving each paper context. He died after the preparation of the second volume, so the essays for the third volume come from his coauthors.", "62574999": "Pierre Jean Ren\u00e9 No\u00ebl Tiollais (born on December 8, 1934, in Rennes) is a French medical doctor and biologist./nHe is a member of the French Academy of sciences[1] of the Institut Pasteur and the French Academy of Medicine.[2]/nIn 1979, in collaboration with Francis Galibert, he carried out the complete sequencing of the hepatitis B virus genome, which made it possible to manufacture the first detection tests and screening for this disease.[citation needed]/nIn 1985, with his collaborators at the Institut Pasteur, he created a vaccine obtained by genetic engineering (recombinant vaccine) against hepatitis B, prepared on Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) .[3] His team were the first to create the hepatitis B vaccine using CHO cells.

The family lived in Guildford, Surrey until her father died in 1896 when they moved to Bournemouth.[3]/nColebrook studied at the Royal Free Hospital in London, gaining her M.B. in 1915 and then M.D. from University of London in 1919.[1] She also gained a Diploma in Bacteriology.[4]/nShe worked initially at the now defunct Jessop Hospital in Sheffield, Yorkshire as a gynaecologist, then moved to Cambridge in general practice.  She then moved to the North Islington Infant Welfare Centre in London.  Her career then re-focused on research./nShe was appointed as the secretary to the Medical Research Council's Clinical and Biological Sub-Committee to the Committee on the Biological Actions of Light after an introduction from her brother, the bacteriologist Leonard Colebrook.  At that time, light therapy from white or ultraviolet light, was becoming increasing popular for an increasing range of conditions. Her research focused on two areas where it was considered to be effective, namely therapy for varicose ulcers and for generically 'sickly' children. A study of 85 patients with varicose ulcers, comparing light therapy with conventional treatment using paste and dressings, indicated that the latter gave a much better outcome.[5][6] Her second study, of 287 infant school children, despite some problems with the experimental design, also did not demonstrate a beneficial effect of light therapy. The study compared three treatments namely with UV light therapy, a treatment where the UV light was screened from the children using glass, and a control group who were not treated with light therapy.[7] In a later randomised controlled trial of coalminers, office and factory workers, she was again unable to show a clear benefit of light therapy.[8]/nHer initial findings about light therapy were controversial since the medical consensus in 1920s held that the well-established light therapy was effective.[6] She was still involved in controversy over the efficacy of light therapy into the late 1940s.[9]/nColebrook worked with her brother on the epidemiology of puerperal sepsis at Queen Charlotte's Hospital, London where she was a Leverhulme Research Fellow. She investigated the source of the streptococcal infections within the hospital. After collecting samples of the bacteria from patients, their families and hospital staff, she used immunology to identify individual streptococcal strains. This showed that the strains causing puerperal sepsis were not special but were the same ones present in the community that caused sore throats. They were acquired by women after childbirth rather than before.[2][4] Working together, the Colebrooks showed that streptococci were more likely to originate from hospital staff than from the patient.[10]", "51761578": "Sara Imari Walker is an American theoretical physicist and astrobiologist with research interests in the origins of life, astrobiology, physics of life, emergence, complex and dynamical systems, and artificial life.[1][2] Walker is deputy director of the Beyond Center for Fundamental Concepts in Science at Arizona State University (ASU), associate director of the ASU-SFI Center for Biosocial Complex Systems and an associate professor at ASU.[3][4] She is a co-founder of the astrobiology social network SAGANet, and on the board of directors for Blue Marble Space, a nonprofit education and science organization.[1] As a science communicator, she is a frequent guest on podcasts and series, such as Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman.[5]/nWalker was born and raised in Connecticut.

She uses mathematical models to investigate chemical evolution and the development of networks on Prebiotic Earth.[8] She looks at information flow in biotic and abiotic systems to further define life and its emergence.[9] Some of the highlights of her work in this field so far are:/nWalker has studied the possible mechanisms of the origin of homochirality, which is a key problem in the origin of life.[10][11][12] In her research she has used several models such as the Sandars polymerization model, the Langevin equation, and the activation-polymerization-epimerization-depolymerization (APED) model to imitate potential prebiotic conditions for autocatalytic polymerization networks. Walker et al. discovered that only networks with long polymers show potential to produce significant spontaneous asymmetrical chirality in speculative early Earth conditions.[12] Walker and her colleagues, have also shown that the violent environment of prebiotic Earth would have continuously changed the chirality of reaction networks by a mechanism they termed punctuated chirality.[11] This suggests that the origin of homochirality was not a singular event, and that chiral selection occurred at the same time as the origin of life. Walker and Gleiser also revealed that homochiral proto-domains can form in the middle of racemic networks, and that the slowdown of these networks through processes such as tidal motion or evaporating pools could have led to the stabilization of these structures on early Earth.[10] The results of these simulations have helped to reveal what possibly occurred during the origin of homochiralty, and its effect on the origin of life./nOne of the major challenges in studying the origin of life has been the inability to clearly define what life is.[9] In her investigations, Walker has used the flow of information in systems as a means to distinguish life from non-life. She used the Boolean network model, information theory, and other models to discern feasible universal traits for life.[9][13][14] It was shown that in biological systems the components are subordinate to the whole, in what is called top-down causation.[9] Furthermore, a logistical model of Walker et al. suggested that major evolutionary transitions, such as the origin of life, could be characterized by a reverse of information flow in a system from bottom-up to top-down.[15] They also determined that living systems have a separation of data from machinery, and non-trivial replication.

His main loves were his scientific work which he finished at Yale University, sailing, working in his shop, and helping in the community.\"[11] Fred and Sally were a major presence in local land conservation efforts, both on committees and in working projects out on the land and water.[10][13] He donated a 41-acre shoreline property to the Yale Peabody Museum Natural Areas, which they described as \"one of the few natural forest areas left in the state.\" The property now has long-term protection for use in biological and geological research.[14]/nOn December 2, 1957, at Yale University, Richards performed a simple experiment on the protein Ribonuclease A (RNase A) that helped change the scientific community's view of the physical nature of protein molecules.[6] Using a particular protease (Subtilisin), RNase A was converted into a split protein (RNase S), which is composed of two parts called S-peptide and S-protein (Richards & Vithayathil 1959). Richards had developed that cleavage system as a postdoc at the Carlsberg Laboratory in Copenhagen, Denmark, using purified ribonuclease protein that had been donated to Christian Anfinsen by the Armour Company and that Anfinsen shared with Richards and other researchers.[4][8] Richards found that, when separated, S-protein and S-peptide had no RNase activity, but that the RNase enzymatic activity was restored when the parts were recombined in the test tube.[15] In an autobiographical piece, Richards wrote that \"this discovery came as a surprise to the scientific community at that time.... In retrospect, this may have been the high point of my career in terms of excitement.\"[6] This experiment showed that proteins maintain 3-dimensional order and tight binding between their interacting parts and that the structural information is inherent in the protein itself, foreshadowing both Anfinsen's later work showing that sequence determines structure[16] and also the idea that hormones or other small molecules can bind tightly and specifically to proteins,[6] a concept basic to how pharmaceutical companies design drugs today. Two years later, the protein structure of myoglobin confirmed such specific 3D relationships.[17]  Later, with Marilyn Doscher and Flo Quiocho, Richards demonstrated that ribonuclease S as well as carboxypeptidase were enzymatically active in the crystals, important evidence to silence doubts that the conformations of proteins in crystals are directly relevant to their biological activity in cells.[7][18][19]/nAlong with colleague Harold W. Wyckoff, who had worked on early research toward the myoglobin structure,[20] the effort to solve the RNase S 3-dimensional structure was spearheaded by Richards. Done in 1966 and published in 1967, the analyses of RNase S [21] and RNase A[22] jointly made ribonuclease the third distinct protein structure to be determined by X-ray diffraction of crystals, after myoglobin/hemoglobin and hen-egg lysozyme,[23] and the first to be done in the United States. Later, the Yale group collected more diffraction data, and in 1970 published the RNase S structure in full detail at 2.0\u00a0\u00c5 resolution (Wyckoff et al., 1970). Coordinates for ribonuclease S were deposited into the international Protein Data Bank in 1973 as PDB: 1RNS\u200b, among the first small set of macromolecular structures.[24]/nThe black-and-white ribbon drawing above shows the large, twisted beta sheet (arrows) of ribonuclease, flanked by several alpha-helices (spirals). The shorter S-peptide piece is behind, starting at upper left with a helix and ending with the chain break (between residues 20-21) at lower right.[5] The active site for RNA cleavage (in the groove at center front in this drawing) involves one histidine side chain from the S-peptide fragment and another from the S-protein part.[21] The computer image shows superimposed structures of ribonuclease S and A, with the S-peptide in gold and the active site histidines in hot pink.  The close match of the 3D structures shows that the 2-fragment S system does indeed fold to the active form (Wyckoff et al., 1970)./nIn 1968, while on sabbatical with David Phillips at Oxford, Richards developed a large optical comparator device called a \"Richards' box\" (or \"Fred's Folly\") which enabled crystallographers to build physical models of protein structures by viewing the stacked sheets of electron density through a half-silvered mirror (see photo).[25][26] Once the Folly had been constructed, he built an all-atom brass model of RNase S quite rapidly.[6] This was the method of choice for building protein crystallographic models into electron density until the late 1970s, when it was superseded by molecular computer graphics programs such as Grip-75[27] and then Frodo.[28]/nRichards showed his sense of humor in a later review of developments in the use and construction of Richards boxes.[29] He provided a \"correction to the Original Bibliographic Citations,\" complete with diagrams, for a theatrical stage technique that used selective illumination and a sheet of plate glass inclined at 45\u00b0 to give an illusion of the nymph Amphitrite rising from the sea and floating in air, or of an audience volunteer dissolving to a skeleton and back again.  Richards ended that section by noting that \"had this reference been known to the author in 1968 no further description of the 'folly' would have been required.\"[29]/nRichards' most enduring long-term scientific interest was in protein folding and packing, studied both experimentally and theoretically, and mostly from a geometrical perspective.  As summarized by George Rose, \"protein folders can be divided into 'minimizers' and 'packers'. The former seek to minimize the interaction energy among atoms or groups of atoms, whereas the latter concentrate on probable geometry, guided by both excluded volume limitations and structural motifs seen in proteins of known structure.\" Fred was a founding influence for the packers, who built on his observations about packing density, areas, and volumes.[9]/nIn 1971, with Byungkook Lee, Richards introduced the concept and a quantitative measure for the solvent-accessible surface (SAS) of amino acid residues in folded protein structures (Lee & Richards 1971). The surface is constructed by tracing the center of an imaginary ball, its radius that of a water molecule (taken as 1.4\u00a0\u00c5), as it rolls over the van der Waals surfaces of the proteins. Thus defined, the surface is continuous and each point on it is unambiguously associated with a specific protein atom (the nearest). The Lee & Richards definition has been widely adopted as the standard measure for solvent accessibility, for instance to evaluate exposure per residue as a percentage of accessible vs total surface area,[30] and as the basis of the buried-surface-area method for estimating the energetics of protein/protein contacts.[31]/nRichards 1974 introduced the Voronoi polyhedra construction to protein chemistry, a contribution reviewed more recently by Gerstein and Richards.[32] This approach has been adopted by many others[33][34] and has been put on a firm mathematical footing by the work of Herbert Edelsbrunner.[35]\nWith Jay Ponder in 1987, as part of an exploration of using internal packing of sidechains to enumerate the possible sequences compatible with a given protein backbone structure (a foreshadowing of protein engineering and design), Richards developed the first side-chain rotamer library. (Ponder & Richards 1987) Increasingly detailed rotamer libraries, such as the Backbone-dependent rotamer library, have been made since then by other research groups, with some used primarily for structure validation[36] and others for homology modeling or protein design.[37]\nWith Craig Kundrot, Richards investigated the effects of high pressure (1000 atmospheres) on protein structure, using hen-egg lysozyme crystals,[38] finding that the structure was robust to such pressures apart from a quite modest compaction in size. In the 1990s, Richards and collaborators used a combination of theory and experiment to investigate how the well-packed interior of proteins can nevertheless accommodate mutations.[39][40][41]/nIn the 1970s, with a succession of students and postdocs, the lab developed a series of chemical,[42] photochemical,[43] and cross-link labels for determining the position and relationships of proteins in biological membranes (Peters & Richards 1977), including glutaraldehyde[44] and what was one of the two first general uses of the exceptionally tight interaction of biotin with avidin,[6] anchored to ferritin for use in electron microscopy.[45][46][47]  The biotin\u2013avidin system quickly became a central method in cell biology, immunology, and protein engineering, as well as electron microscopy.[48]/nWith David Wishart and Brian Sykes, he developed the chemical shift index for NMR assignment of protein secondary structure (Wishart, Sykes & Richards 1991 & Wishart, Sykes & Richards 1992).  This is still considered a standard tool in the NMR field.[49]  Separately, around 1990, Homme Hellinga, with Richards, developed computational tools to design metal-binding sites into proteins,[50] and used them to build a new metal site into thioredoxin.[51]/nRichards is named as a depositor on 27 crystal structure entries in the Protein Data Bank, including the now-obsoleted ribonuclease S (PDB: 1RNS\u200b), hen egg lysozyme (PDB: 2LYM\u200b), SH3 domains (PDB: 1SEM\u200b), the ion-channel-forming alamethicin (PDB: 1AMT\u200b) (Fox & Richards 1982), and mutants of ribonuclease S (e.g., PDB: 1RBD\u200b;PDB: 1RBI\u200b), of Staphylococcal nuclease (e.g., PDB: 1NUC\u200b;PDB: 1A2T\u200b), and of lambda repressor in complex with DNA (PDB: 1LLI\u200b)./nThe Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry (\"MB&B\")[52] that Richards founded and chaired at Yale, which amalgamated the medical school Biochemistry and the university Molecular Biophysics departments, was considered to have \"quickly gained pre-eminent stature.\"[9] Many of those faculty became members of the National Academy of Sciences,[4][9] and Tom Steitz shared the Nobel Prize in 2009 for crystal structures of the ribosome.[53] Richards was known as a highly valued mentor and friend to students, faculty, and colleagues, including a very supportive approach to women and African\u2013Americans, according to Norma Allewell, quoted in a remembrance by Jim Staros.[12] His colleague George D. Rose wrote that Richards' lectures were insightful, delivered with clarity and humor, and often deliberately provocative, and that Richards worked to improve the scientific community in general.[9] For instance, in the late 1980s, he was the primary author, and the first of many signers, of a widely circulated letter that successfully urged a policy of depositing 3D atomic coordinates on scientific journals, on the NIH, and on individual crystallographers.[6][54] He also lobbied, less successfully, for a let-up in overall publication pressure but an increased emphasis on a few first-class papers, by having promotion committees only consider a list of 12 key papers.[6]/nArticles with over 500 citations according to Web of Science as of June 18, 2012:[61]/nPodcast", "73093584": "Karen Leigh Christman is an American bioengineer who is the Associate Dean for Faculty Affairs and the Pierre Galletti Endowed Chair for Bioengineering Innovation at University of California, San Diego.[1][2] Her research considers regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.

Horsley was often placed in the care of graduate students, who served as her babysitters.[1] She initially considered a career in medicine working as a physician, but opted to pursue a career in research instead.[2] In 1998, Horsley achieved a Bachelor of Science in biology at Furman University, and later her doctorate from Emory University in 2003.[3]/nThe research Horsley explored throughout the duration of her doctorate degree, which was supervised by Grace Pavlath, focused on the transcription factors involved in the development of skeletal muscle tissue.[4] The lab that Horsley worked in discovered that smaller muscles in mice were associated with a lack of transcription factor NFATc2. She was able to determine that factor NFATc2 was a foundational component that allotted myoblast cells to fuse and develop muscle fibers. She also found that NFATc2 factor regulates the transcription of a cytokine, IL-4.[5]/nHorsley later decided to shift away from muscle research to complete her postdoctoral training under the guidance of Elaine Fuchs at Rockefeller University.[2]  It was during this process that she investigated the factors that influence stem cell development in the skin, specifically the transcription of factor Blimp-1. After finding that eliminating the gene that encoded Blimp-1 led to oily skin in mice, Horsley discovered that Blimp-1 monitors the size of the sebaceous gland.[6]/nIn 2009, Horsley joined the faculty of Yale University and was promoted to an associate professor of dermatology in 2011, as well as the Maxine F.

Mechanisms of adipocyte cells in tissue homeostasis and regeneration are not well understood. Horsley discovered the source of both fat cells and immune cells as local signals, as the hormone signal, prolactin, is responsible for stem cell activity and the regeneration of skin cells.[9] Together, her laboratory also found that cell differentiation of adipocytes and hair growth occur simultaneously, and when the cell differentiation process (adipogenesis) ceases, hair growth stops and the follicles deteriorate. Her team identified specific adipose progenitors in the skin, which indicated the necessity of these cells to sufficiently induce hair follicle growth. These cells are activated after injury and are required for fibroblast migration during the wound healing process. The Horsley laboratory discovered that aging causes the loss of dermal adipocyte precursor cells regeneration, and therefore requires Pdgf signaling.[10] Furthermore, adipocytes stem cells can form myofibroblasts after skin injury that generate extracellular matrix proteins and crosslink collagen and these cells are stimulated by macrophage-derived signaling proteins.[11] Her research provides a link between the communication of various cells which lead to hair growth and wound healing, revealing a framework for the possible regulation of tissue repair and the development of various diseases./nMechanical forces are known to regulate the development, homeostasis and regeneration of multicellular tissues.

During this time she also studied at the University of G\u00f6ttingen and made significant discoveries there.[5]/nGreider is dyslexic and states that her \"compensatory skills also played a role in my success as a scientist because one has to intuit many different things that are going on at the same time and apply those to a particular problem\".[6] Greider initially suspected her dyslexia after seeing patterns of common mistakes such as backward words when she received back graded work in the first grade.[7] Greider started to memorize words and their spellings rather than attempting to sound out the spelling of words.[6] Greider has worked significantly to overcome her dyslexia to become successful in her professional life and credits her dyslexia as helping her appreciate differences and making unusual decisions such as the one to work with Tetrahymena, an unusual organism.[6]/nGreider initially had difficulty getting into graduate school because of her low GRE scores, a result of her dyslexia. Greider applied to thirteen grad schools and was accepted to only two, California Institute of Technology and the University of California, Berkeley.[6] She chose Berkeley, where she would be able to work with Elizabeth Blackburn and where the two would make their telomerase discovery.[6]/nGreider completed her Ph.D. in molecular biology in 1987 at Berkeley under Elizabeth Blackburn. While at Berkeley, Greider and Blackburn discovered how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase.[8]\nGreider joined Blackburn's laboratory in April 1984 looking for the enzyme that was hypothesized to add extra DNA bases to the ends of chromosomes. Without the extra bases, which are added as repeats of a six-base pair motif, chromosomes are shortened during DNA replication, eventually resulting in chromosome deterioration and senescence or cancer-causing chromosome fusion. Blackburn and Greider looked for the enzyme in the model organism Tetrahymena thermophila, a fresh-water protozoan with a large number of telomeres.[9]/nOn December 25, 1984, Greider first obtained results indicating that a particular enzyme was likely responsible. After six months of additional research, Greider and Blackburn concluded that it was the enzyme responsible for telomere addition. They published their findings in the journal Cell in December 1985.[10] The enzyme, originally called \"telomere terminal transferase,\" is now known as telomerase. Telomerase rebuilds the tips of chromosomes and determines the life span of cells.[11]/nGreider's additional research to confirm her discovery was largely focused on identifying the mechanism that telomerase uses for elongation.[12] Greider chose to use RNA degrading enzymes and saw that the telomeres stopped extending, which was an indication that RNA was involved in the enzyme.[12]/nGreider then started her own laboratory as a Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Fellow, and also held a faculty position, at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Long Island, New York. Greider continued to study Tetrahymena telomerase, cloning the gene encoding the RNA component and demonstrating that it provided the template for the TTGGGG telomere repeats (1989)[13] as well as establishing that telomerase is processive (1991).[14] She was also able to reconstitute Tetrahymena telomerase in vitro (1994)[15] and define the mechanisms of template utilization (1995).[16] Greider also worked with Calvin Harley to show that telomere shortening underlies cellular senescence (1990).[17][18] To further test this idea mouse and human telomerase were characterized (1993)[19] (1995)[20] and the mouse telomerase RNA component was cloned (1995).[21]/nDuring this time, Greider, in collaboration with Ronald A. DePinho, produced the first telomerase knockout mouse,[22] showing that although telomerase is dispensable for life, increasingly short telomeres result in various deleterious phenotypes, colloquially referred to as premature aging.[23] In the mid-1990s, Greider was recruited by Michael D. West, founder of biotechnology company Geron (now CEO of AgeX Therapeutics) to join the company's Scientific Advisory Board[24] and remained on the Board until 1997./nGreider accepted a faculty position at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1997. Greider continued to study telomerase deficient mice and saw that her sixth generation of mice had become entirely sterile,[25] but when mated with control mice the telomerase deficient mice were able to regenerate their telomeres.[12][26] Greider continued to work on telomerase biochemistry, defining the secondary structure (2000) [27] and template boundary (2003)[28] of vertebrate telomerase RNA as well as analyzing the pseudoknot structure in human telomerase RNA (2005).[29] In addition to working in Tetrahymena and mammalian systems, Greider also studied telomeres and telomerase in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, further characterizing the recombination-based gene conversion mechanism that yeast cells null for telomerase use to maintain telomeres (1999)[30] (2001).[31] Greider also showed that short telomeres elicit a DNA damage response in yeast (2003).[32]/nGreider, Blackburn, and Szostak shared the 2006 Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research for their work on telomeres,[33] before jointly receiving the Nobel Prize in 2009./nIn February 2014, Greider was named a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins University.[34]/nGreider served as director of and professor at the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics at Johns Hopkins Medicine.[11] Greider was first promoted to Daniel Nathans Professor at the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics in 2004.[35]/nAs of 2021, she is a professor of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology at UCSC.[citation needed]/nGreider's lab employs both student and post-doctoral trainees[36] to further examine the relationships between the biology of telomeres and their connection to disease.[35] Greider's lab uses a variety of tools including yeast, mice, and biochemistry to look at progressive telomere shortening.[37] Greider's lab is also researching how tumor reformation can be controlled by the presence of short telomeres.[37] The lab's future work will focus more on identifying the processing and regulation of telomeres and telomere elongation.[37]/nGreider married Nathaniel C.

Various women were asked to smell the shirts, and to indicate to which shirts they were most sexually attracted.  The results showed that women were most attracted to men with an MHC most dissimilar from their own.[4]/nIt has been suggested that MHC plays a role in the selection of potential mates, via olfaction. MHC genes make molecules that enable the immune system to recognise invaders; generally, the more diverse the MHC genes of the parents, the stronger the immune system of the offspring. It would obviously be beneficial, therefore, to have a system of recognizing individuals with different MHC genes and preferentially selecting them to breed with. Yamazaki et al. (1976) showed this to be the case for male mice, who show such a preference for females of different MHC. Similar results have been obtained with fish.[5]/nIn a 1995 experiment by Wedekind,[6] a group of female college students smelled t-shirts that had been worn by male students for two nights, without deodorant, cologne or scented soaps. Overwhelmingly, the women preferred the odors of men with dissimilar MHCs to their own. However, their preference was reversed if they were taking oral contraceptives.[7] The hypothesis is that MHCs affect mate choice and that oral contraceptives can interfere with this.

He received his PhD degree in 1977 in physical chemistry.[3]/nWorking as a research assistant at the G\u00f6ttingen MPI since 1977 Frahm formed an independent research team which focused on the new possibilities offered by spatially resolved NMR and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \u2013 discovered in 1974, by Paul Lauterbur and Peter Mansfield./nIn 1982 the Biomedical NMR group was formally founded and from 1984 to 1992 primarily financed via two substantial grants from the Ministry for Research and Technology of the German Federal Government. The primary aim of the projects was a more sophisticated development of the rather modest MRI techniques available in the early eighties \u2013 mainly with respect to speed and specificity. Already in 1985 the group presented a major breakthrough for the future development of MRI in both science and medicine. The invention of a rapid imaging principle, the FLASH MRI (fast low angle shot) technique, allowed for a 100-fold reduction of the measuring times of cross-sectional and three-dimensional images. The FLASH acquisition technique led the ground for many modern MRI applications in diagnostic imaging. Examples include breathhold imaging of the abdomen, electrocardiogram-synchronized quasi-real time movies of the beating heart, dynamic scanning of contrast media uptake, 3D imaging of complex anatomic structures such as the brain that allow for unprecedented high spatial resolution and arbitrary view angles, and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the vasculature. Other achievements extended to MRI and localized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques based on stimulated echoes \u2013 another invention from 1984./nUp to date royalties from the group's patents serve to fully support all activities of the Biomedizinische NMR Forschungs GmbH (not-for-profit) which was founded in 1993 as an independent research unit associated with the G\u00f6ttingen MPI.

Since 2019 Frahm continues his research at the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr biophysikalische Chemie as Emeritus Director heading a focused research group working on the further technical development and clinical translation of real-time MRI methods and their derivatives./nCentral to the research of Frahm is the further methodologic development of MRI and localized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in conjunction with advanced applications in neurobiology (brain research) and cardiovascular research. The truly interdisciplinary team aims at innovative noninvasive approaches to study the central nervous system of humans and animals \u2013 from insects to primates with a special emphasis on mouse models of human brain disorders. Using several high-field MRI systems, current possibilities include structural, metabolic, and functional assessments of the intact living brain. Techniques range from high-resolution 3D MRI studies of brain morphology and localized proton MRS of brain metabolism to fiber tractography of the axonal connectivity via diffusion tensor imaging and mapping of the functional architecture of cortical networks by functional MRI./nCurrent methodologic projects focus on the use of iterative image reconstruction techniques for non-cartesian MRI (e.g., undersampled radial MRI) and parallel MRI that define the reconstruction process as a nonlinear inverse problem. Other developments address the possibility of real-time MRI in order to overcome the motion sensitivity of conventional MRI acquisitions and to monitor organ movements in real time. Most recent achievements in real-time MRI are based on FLASH techniques with highly undersampled radial data encodings. When combined with image reconstruction by nonlinear inversion with temporal regularization, they allow for movies of the human heart with image acquisition times as short as 10 to 30 milliseconds, which correspond to MRI movies with up to 100 frames per second. Such real-time movies may continuously be recorded during free breathing, without ECG synchronization, and without motion artifacts. Apart from cardiac applications and quantitative measurements of blood flow in real time, novel possibilities range from studies of joint movements, bowel motility and swallowing mechanics (e.g., dysphagia and reflux disorders) to speech generation and brass playing. Interactive real-time MRI will also revitalize \"interventional\" MRI which refers to MRI monitoring of minimally invasive procedures. A selection of example MRI videos can be found here: Biomedizinische NMR. The development of a high-quality and robust real-time MRI technique must be considered another breakthrough in MRI that promises to shape its future. Real-time MRI will again broaden the diagnostic potential of MRI by adding completely new, hitherto impossible scientific and clinical applications as well as by simplifying and shortening existing procedures./nMore recently, the algorithm for regularized nonlinear inversion (NLINV) has been extended to allow for model-based reconstructions of quantitative parametric maps directly from suitable sets of MRI raw data. Relevant physical or physiological parameters are, for example, T1 relaxation times of water protons in various body tissues and the velocities of blood flow or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow. These novel approaches include a corresponding signal model into the MRI signal equation and therefore always pose a nonlinear inverse reconstruction problem. However, as already demonstrated for real-time MRI, the computational demand is met by a user-invisible GPU-based bypass computer which may be retrofitted to an existing MRI system. The results offer fundamental advantages in comparison to conventional mapping methods which are based on serial image reconstructions followed by pixelwise fitting./nThe list of Frahm's publications exhibits more than 550 entries comprising patents, scientific articles, review articles, and book chapters (as of July 2023), see Jens Frahm.

Her work includes studies of agricultural practices in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, seasons of birth in human beings, the relationship between cultural gender bias and infant mortality, and the possible role of selenium in reducing mortality from AIDS. She also looked after four pottos for many years and published a series of observations on their behaviour.[3]/nCowgill earned a PhD from Iowa State University in 1956. Later she worked as an analytical chemist for the limnologist G. Evelyn Hutchinson. Her first journal articles, some published jointly with Hutchinson, appeared in the early 1960s./nCowgill was living in Colorado as of 2003. In addition to her scientific research, she was an activist with the American Civil Liberties Union./nIn 1959, three pairs of pottos from West Africa arrived at Yale's Osborn Zoological Laboratory. At first they lived in the laboratory with a number of other nocturnal prosimians that Cowgill and Hutchinson were studying. In 1964, Cowgill took two of the pairs to live with her. She looked after them until 1981, when she gave the sole surviving male to a colleague./nWhile the pottos were with her, Cowgill published a number of journal articles on their anatomy, diet, reproduction, illnesses and recovery, and social behaviour. These publications constitute one of the few long-term studies of pottos in captivity./nBetween 1961 and 1963, Cowgill and Hutchinson made studies of soil in the Pet\u00e9n Basin, Guatemala, with the aim of learning about the effects of agricultural practices of the pre-Columbian Maya civilization.[4] Their findings reported that Maya cultivation methods had gradually robbed the soil of vital elements, meaning that it eventually became unable to sustain crops. Some scholars have linked this exhaustion of the soil to the 10th-century decline of the Maya urban settlements in the Pet\u00e9n region./nCowgill's research into gender and child mortality covered both historical records in England and contemporary observations in Guatemala. Using birth and death records from the parish registers of York between 1538 and 1812, Cowgill found that throughout the city's history, girls at every stage of childhood had died at a higher rate than boys of the same age. This resulted in an adult sex ratio of 136 males for every 100 females. Cowgill theorised that this was partly because girls were more likely to be victims of infanticide, and partly because sons tended to receive better feeding and care than daughters.[5]/nIn Guatemala, Cowgill studied an indigenous village where the sex ratio was even more skewed\u2014178:100. Cowgill observed that mothers in this village breastfed sons for much longer than daughters, and tended to give them preferential treatment even after weaning. Cowgill and Hutchinson also speculated that the sexually provocative behaviour of young girls in this village might be a survival mechanism./nCowgill undertook one of the first scientific studies of seasonality in human reproduction. Taking data from historical records and indigenous peoples in various countries, she concluded that conception and birth in human beings, like that of many other animals, followed seasonal patterns to a degree. Because the pattern was different in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, Cowgill hypothesised that weather was the determining factor. However, she found that in urbanised and industrialised areas the pattern had been disrupted. Her 1966 article on the topic, published in the journal Ecology, has formed the basis for subsequent research by other scientists./nIn 1997, Cowgill gauged the selenium content of soil in various locations in the United States by measuring the amount of the mineral that was absorbed by alfalfa. She then correlated this information with the mortality rate of AIDS in the area. She found that the more selenium there was in the soil, the lower mortality from AIDS was.

The company was acquired by Luminex in 2011.[13][14] He founded Firebird BioMolecular Sciences LLC in 2005.[12][15][16]/nBenner's research falls into four major areas:/nThe Benner laboratory is an originator of the field of \"synthetic biology\", which seeks to generate, by chemical synthesis, molecules that reproduce the complex behavior of living systems, including their genetics, inheritance, and evolution. Some high points of past work in chemical genetics are listed below./nIn 1984, Benner's laboratory at Harvard was the first to report the chemical synthesis of a gene encoding an enzyme,[18][19][20] following Khorana's synthesis of a shorter gene for tRNA in 1970.[21] This was the first designed gene of any kind, a pioneering achievement that laid the groundwork for protein engineering.[22]  The design strategies introduced in this synthesis are now widely used to support protein engineering.[23]/nEfforts toward the goal of artificial genetic systems were first reported by Benner and coworkers in 1989, when they developed the first unnatural base pair.[24][25][26][27] Benner and his colleagues have since developed a six-letter artificially expanded genetic information system called Artificially Expanded Genetic Information System (AEGIS) which includes two additional nonstandard nucleotides (Z and P) in addition to the four standard nucleotides (G, A, C, and T).[28][29][30][31]  AEGIS has its own supporting molecular biology.[5] It enables the synthesis of proteins with more than the naturally-encoded 20 amino acids, and provides insight into how nucleic acids form duplex structures, how proteins interact with nucleic acids,[32] and how alternative genetic systems might appear in non-terran life.[33]/nBenner is one of a number of researchers, including Eric T. Kool, Floyd E. Romesberg,  Ichiro Hirao, Mitsuhiko Shionoya and Andrew Ellington, who have created an extended alphabet of synthetic bases that can be incorporated into DNA (as well as RNA) using Watson-Crick bonding (as well as non-Watson-Crick bonding). While most of these synthetic bases are derivatives of the A, C, G, T bases, some are different. While some are in Watson-Crick pairs (A/T, C/G), some are self complementing (X/X). Thus the genetic alphabet has been expanded.[15][25][27][34][35][36][37][38]:\u200a88\u201398/nThe number of possible nucleotide triplets, or codons, available in protein synthesis depends on the number of nucleotides available.  The standard alphabet (G, A, C, and T) yields 43 = 64 possible codons, while an expanded DNA alphabet with 9 DNA bases would have 93 = 729 possible codons, many of them synthetic codons.  For these codons to be useful, Aminoacyl tRNA synthetase has been created such that tRNA can code for the possibly synthetic amino acid to be coupled with its corresponding synthetic anti-codon.  Brenner has described such a system which uses synthetic iso-C/iso-G DNA which uses the synthetic DNA codon [iso-C/A/G] which he calls the 65th codon. Synthetic mRNA with synthetic anti-codon [iso-G/U/C] with synthetic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase results in an in vivo experiment that can code for a synthetic amino acid incorporated into synthetic polypeptides (synthetic proteomics).[38]:\u200a100\u2013106/nBenner has used synthetic organic chemistry and biophysics to create a \"second generation\" model for nucleic acid structure. The first generation model of DNA was proposed by James Watson and Francis Crick, based on crystallized X-ray structures being studied by Rosalind Franklin.  According to the double-helix model, DNA is composed of two complementary strands of nucleotides coiled around each other.[39] Benner's model emphasizes the role of the sugar and phosphate backbone in the genetic molecular recognition event.   The poly-anionic backbone is important in creating the extended structure that helps DNA to replicate.[40][41][42]/nIn 2004, Benner reported the first successful attempt to design an artificial DNA-like molecule capable of reproducing itself.[22]/nIn the late 1980s, Benner recognized the potential for genome sequencing projects to generate millions of sequences and enable researchers to do extensive mapping of molecular structures in organic chemistry. In the early 1990s, Benner met Gaston Gonnet, beginning a collaboration that applied Gonnet's tools for text searching to the management of protein sequences.[43][44] In 1990, in collaboration with Gaston Gonnet, the Benner laboratory introduced the DARWIN bioinformatics workbench. DARWIN (Data Analysis and Retrieval With Indexed Nucleic acid-peptide sequences) was a high-level programming environment for examining genomic sequences. It supported the matching of genomic sequences in databases, and generated information that showed how natural proteins could divergently evolve under functional constraints by accumulating mutations, insertions, and deletions.[45]  Building on Darwin, the Benner laboratory provided tools to predict the three dimensional structure of proteins from sequence data. Information about known protein structures was collected and marketed as a commercial database, the Master Catalog, by Benner's startup EraGen.[45]/nThe use of multiple sequence information to predict secondary structure of proteins became popular as a result of the work of Benner and Gerloff.[46][47][48] Predictions of protein secondary structure by Benner and colleagues achieved high accuracy.[49] It became possible to model protein folds, detect distant homologs, enable structural genomics, and join protein sequence, structure, and function. Further, this work suggested limits to structure prediction by homology, defining what can and cannot be done with this strategy.[45]/nBenner's approach opened new perspectives on how nucleic acids work, as well as tools for diagnostics and nanotechnology. The FDA has approved products that use AEGIS DNA in human diagnostics. These monitor the loads of virus in patients infected with hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV.[50] AEGIS has been the basis of the development of tools for multiplexed detection of genetic markers such as cancer cells[51] and single nucleotide polymorphisms in patient samples. These tools will allow personalized medicine using \"point-of-care\" genetic analysis,[52] as well as research tools that measure the level of individual mRNA molecules within single processes of single living neurons.[53]/nInterpreting genomic data and projecting back to a common genetic ancestor, \"Luca\", the Benner laboratory has introduced tools that analyze patterns of conservation and variation using structural biology, study variation in these patterns across different branches of an evolutionary tree, and correlate events in the genetic record with events in the history of the biosphere known from geology and fossils. From this have emerged examples showing how the roles of biomolecules in contemporary life can be understood through models of the historical past.[54][55]/nBenner was an originator of the field of experimental paleogenetics, where genes and proteins from ancient organisms are resurrected using bioinformatics and recombinant DNA technology.[56] Experimental work on ancient proteins has tested hypotheses about the evolution of complex biological functions, including the biochemistry of ruminant digestion,[57][58]:\u200a209\u200a the thermophily of ancient bacteria, and the interaction between plants, fruits, and fungi at the time of the Cretaceous extinction.[58]:\u200a17\u200a These develop our understanding of biological behavior that extends from the molecule to the cell to the organism, ecosystem, and planet, sometimes referred to as planetary biology.[58]:\u200a221/nBenner is deeply interested in the origin of life, and the conditions necessary to support an RNA-world model in which self-replicating RNA is a precursor to life on Earth. He has identified calcium, borate, and molybdenum as important to the successful formation of carbohydrates and the stabilization of RNA.[59] He suggested that the planet Mars may have had more desirable conditions than Earth for the initial production of RNA,[60][61] but more recently agreed that models of early Earth showing dry land and intermittent water, developed by Stephen Mojzsis, present sufficient conditions for RNA development.[12]/nThe Benner group has worked to identify molecular structures likely to be universal features of living systems regardless of their genesis, and not likely products of non-biological processes. These are \"biosignatures\", both for terrean-like life and for \"weird\" life forms.[3][62][63]/nOne of these universal life identifiers was proposed in the Polyelectrolyte Theory of the Gene. This idea proposes that proposes that for a linear genetic biopolymer dissolved in water, such as DNA, to undergo Darwinian evolution anywhere in the universe, it must be a polyelectrolyte, a polymer containing repeating ionic charges.[64] This concept was linked by Benner to the \"aperiodic crystal\" view of the gene as proposed by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger's book \"what is life?\" to make a robust universally generalizable view of genetic biomolecule.[65] This idea has been suggest as a framework by which scientist may look for life on other solar bodies besides Earth.[66]", "34296370": "Major General Sir Sahib Singh Sokhey FNA, FASc (15 December 1887 \u2013 24 October 1971) was an Indian biochemist, a British Indian Army general and a military physician who was also a nominated member of the Rajya Sabha, the Upper House of the Indian Parliament, from 3 April 1952 to 2 April 1956.[1]/nSahib Singh Sokhey was born in Amritsar, Punjab on 15 December 1887 to Sardar Jwala Singh Sokhey, a civil engineer who worked on various irrigation projects in the Punjab and in Burma, then part of British India.

Crusio (born Wilhelmus Elisabeth Crusio on 20 December 1954) is a Dutch behavioral neurogeneticist and a directeur de recherche (research director) with the French National Centre for Scientific Research in Talence, France./nCrusio received his bachelor's degree in biology from Radboud University Nijmegen in 1975, where he went on to obtain a master's degree and then a PhD in 1979 and 1984, respectively.[1] His Anubias revision, which was originally published in 1979,[1] was translated in German[2] and continues to engender interest.[3] For his PhD thesis, Crusio studied the inheritance of the effects of anosmia on exploratory behavior of mice, and more in general the genetic architecture of exploratory behavior, using quantitative-genetic methods such as the diallel cross.[4] From 1984 to 1987, Crusio worked as a postdoc at the University of Heidelberg, supported by a NATO Science Fellowship[5] and an Alexander von Humboldt Research Fellowship.[6] During 1988, Crusio spent a year in Paris, France, supported by a fellowship from the Fyssen Foundation.[7] He then returned to Heidelberg as a senior research scientist before being recruited as charg\u00e9 de recherche by the CNRS, initially working in an institute of the Universit\u00e9 Ren\u00e9 Descartes (Paris V) and later moving to the CNRS campus in Orl\u00e9ans, having been promoted to directeur de recherche.[5] In 2000 he became full professor of psychiatry at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, Massachusetts, returning to the CNRS in 2005 as a group leader in the Centre de Neurosciences Int\u00e9gratives et Cognitives in Talence, a suburb of Bordeaux.[5][8][9] He is currently adjunct director of the Institut de Neurosciences Cognitives et Int\u00e9gratives d'Aquitaine.[10]/nCrusio and his collaborators found that neuroanatomical variations in the mouse hippocampus, in particular the sizes of their intra- and infrapyramidal mossy fibers (IIPMF) correlated with learning performance.[11] Together with Herbert Schwegler and Hans-Peter Lipp, Crusio showed that an inverse correlation, that is, animals with larger IIPMF learn better, could be found for spatial learning in a radial arm maze task.[12][13][14] Taken together, Crusio and collaborators think that it is highly likely that this correlation is causal,[15] although this is not universally accepted.[16]/nWhen mice are exposed to unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS), they start exhibiting symptoms reminiscent of major depressive disorder in humans.[17] As it had been suggested that deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis might underlie depression,[18] Crusio and collaborators undertook a series of experiments investigating changes in behavior and neurogenesis in mice that had undergone UCMS. They showed dramatic changes in levels of aggression,[19] anxiety,[20][21] depressive-like behaviors,[20] and learning,[22] with a concomitant drop in neurogenesis.[22] However, the results were strain- and sex-specific and there did not appear to be a clear-cut correlation between the different changes, so that they finally concluded that although their data do not disprove the idea that deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis solely underlie the behavioral impairments observed in human psychiatric disorders such as depression, they do not provide support for this hypothesis either.[22]/nMore recently, Crusio has been investigating the possibility that Fmr1 knockout mice might perhaps be used as a model for autism. This idea is based on the fact that patients suffering from the Fragile X syndrome, caused by a deficiency of the FMR1 gene often show autistic symptoms. A good mouse model for the Fragile X syndrome is available in the form of mice in which the Fmr1 gene (the mouse homologue of the human FMR1 gene) has been invalidated.[23] A review of the findings obtained with these mice in many different laboratories did indeed indicate that these animals display autistic-like symptoms,[24] especially changes in social behavior, a key symptom of autism.[25][26]/nCrusio is the founding editor-in-chief of Genes, Brain and Behavior, which he edited from 2001 to 2011.[27] The standards for the publication of mouse mutant studies that he and his co-editors developed for this journal[28] are gradually being accepted in the field.[29][30][31] Since 2017, Crusio is the editor-in-chief of  Behavioral and Brain Functions[32] and since 2019 co-editor of Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology.[33] He is also an academic editor of PLoS ONE and served as associate editor of Behavioral and Brain Sciences (1991\u20132008) and The Scientific World Journal (2002-2011).

In 2007, she was awarded a readership and in 2010 a professorship at the University of Cambridge.[citation needed]/nUpon setting up her independent group in 1997, she studied the mechanisms regulating early mammalian development. To do this, she was first to establish RNA interference in mammalian cells to determine cell fate in the mouse embryos.[10] At that time, she also began to trace the origins and destinies of cells in the preimplantation mouse embryo that let her to discover that cell fate specification begins earlier than expected,[11][12][13][14] an unexpected discovery but subsequently validated by her group and others. She found that this development of cell identity begins with heterogeneity in epigenetic regulation at the 4-cell stage[15] that directs a molecular cascade establishing cell polarity, position and fate.[16][17][18][19]/nHer recent development of systems permitting both mouse and human embryogenesis during implantation and early post-implantation stages in vitro allowed her to reveal that mouse and human embryo remodelling at implantation is done autonomously by the embryo. She uncovered the mechanism underlying embryo remodelling between the blastocyst and gastrula stages that has led to a change in the textbook model.[20][21] The demonstration of the self-organisation of human embryos developing in vitro until day 13/14, by Zernicka-Goetz and Ali Brivanlou groups, has provided an unprecedented opportunity to study human development at previously inaccessible and critical stages.[22][23] This discovery was hailed as the people's choice for the scientific breakthrough of 2016 by Science magazine.[24][25]  The knowledge she gained through her work on how the embryo develops during the blastocyst to gastrula transition, allowed her to mimic these developmental processes with different types of stem cells in vitro. This led her to the pioneering success of constructing embryo-like structures from pluripotent embryonic and multipotent extra-embryonic (trophoblast) stem cells in a 3D scaffold of extra-cellular matrix proteins in vitro.[26] These \"synthetic embryos\" recapitulate the natural architecture of the embryo and their patterns of gene expression leading to the specification of the germ layers and germ cells. This system allowed her to identify signalling pathways responsible for morphogenesis of stem cells into embryos. Together these models bring outstanding potential for understanding development and for regenerative medicine.[27] In 2023, her team was among several that reported creating the first human embryo models.[27][28][29][30]/n\u017bernicka-Goetz's group have shown that sperm entry induces actomyosin-driven cytoplasmic flows that are predictive of successful development to birth in the mouse.

Her lab generated an experimental model to find that aneuploid cells arising during embryogenesis in the mouse embryo become eliminated by apoptosis in embryonic but not extra-embryonic tissues.

Much of his early research included comparative and experimental studies on reptiles to understand the evolution of endothermy in mammals and birds, including the physiological and morphological alterations involved and the selective factors that promoted its development. His work also explored the adaptive patterns in behavior and energy allocation of ectothermic vertebrates,[14] particularly reptiles,[15][16] which have limited oxygen uptake and rely on anaerobic metabolism for intense activity. In a highly cited 1979 joint research work with J. Ruben, he compared aerobic metabolism between endothermic and ectothermic vertebrates, highlighting the importance of aerobic metabolism in the former. This study suggested that the evolution of endothermy was driven by the need to increase aerobic capacities for sustained activity and not just for thermoregulation alone.[17] In other studies, he also evaluated the thermal dependence of locomotor capacity in ectothermic vertebrates and found that low temperature greatly constrains performance.[18] He argued for the need for a comprehensive concept of thermal adaptation that considers all levels of biological organization, from molecules to whole organisms, and their connections to fitness and ecological success.[19]/nBennett's research has a focus on metabolism that explores various organizational levels, including enzymatic, organismal, and ecological aspects. In this regard, he compared and contrasted the physiology of lower vertebrates (such as reptiles, amphibians, and fish) with mammals and birds during activity, particularly exploring oxygen consumption, anaerobic metabolism, and body temperature effects.[20] Through his research studies, he found that an organism's metabolic design and capacities play a significant role in determining the types and levels of feasible behavior, allowing behavior only within those constraints.[21] In another study, he measured the metabolic rates of western fence lizards in both laboratory and field settings. This research stressed upon the importance of considering activity levels when measuring metabolic rates and comparing them to those of birds and mammals.[22]/nIn conjunction with R. Huey and T. Garland, Bennett's research highlighted the importance of using phylogenetic information in comparative studies, introduced three methods and provided examples, while addressing potential difficulties and emphasizing the importance of evolutionary history.[23] Their research adopted an ecological and evolutionary framework developed to examine how organisms adapt to natural environmental variations and to analyze organismal adjustments to heat stress.[24]/nBennett outlined four general approaches to the study of evolutionary physiology and demonstrated the value of selection experiments in testing hypotheses about functional character evolution.[25] Maintaining that experimental evolution is a valuable tool to test evolutionary hypotheses and determine adaptive responses to new environments, he, in collaboration with R. Lenski and other researchers, examined the patterns of evolutionary change in bacterial populations exposed to different thermal and acidic conditions to investigate evolutionary dynamics in diverse environments. They studied the number and diversity of beneficial mutations by subjecting 115 Escherichia coli populations to 2000 generations of evolution at high temperature. The experiment resulted in the identification of 1331 mutations affecting 600 sites, revealing the presence of epistasis among beneficial mutations that shape adaptive trajectories.[26] Through two additional bacterial experiments, they assessed the impact of adaptation, chance, and history on the evolution of fitness and cell size, and found that populations achieved similar fitness regardless of history or chance, while the evolution of cell size was influenced by both history and chance.[27] They additionally tested the evolutionary hypothesis of trade-off, the necessary loss of fitness in other environments during adaptation to a new one. Twenty-four bacterial populations were adapted to low temperature and correlated fitness change at high temperature was determined. Loss of fitness was observed in 15 populations, but not in the other 9.  Consequently, trade-offs were generally, but not universally observed.[28]", "31511156": "Valter D.

Demain's uncles Ben and Seymour operated another pickling factory, Demain Foods Co., in Ayden, North Carolina. According to one source, \"Henry was a leader in the pickle business, working for Fields and then Bloch and Guggenheimer in New York before setting up the pickle plant in Chestertown.\" Demain himself said that his grandfather, Joseph Demain, \"had sold pickles for years in one of New York's major market areas.\"[6] Demain attended five different public elementary schools and three different public high schools in Brooklyn and the Bronx, and graduated high school at age 16.[4][6][7]/nDemain attended Michigan State briefly, then joined the U.S. Navy in 1945 and spent two years in Philadelphia caring for amputees who were members of the armed forces who had been injured in the war.

In the 1940s and 50s he built the first microscope capable of imaging dynamic processes in live cells, using polarized light, and proved for the first time that the mitotic spindle is composed of aligned protein fibers.[2] We now know these fibers are microtubules. By perturbing cells with agents that cause microtubules to depolymerize (e.g. colchicine or high pressure) or  polymerize excessively (e.g. D2O), Inou\u00e9 demonstrated that spindle fibers are in a state of rapid dynamic equilibrium with a pool of soluble subunits in the cytoplasm. He went on to show that artificial polymerization and depolymerization of spindle fibers can generate forces within the cell, and proposed that chromosomes are normally moved by such forces during mitosis. These ideas were summarized in a seminal review in 1967.[3] He also was the first to develop video microscopy, and wrote a major textbook on the subject.[4] Consistent with Inou\u00e9's pioneering ideas, it is now widely believed that chromosome movement during mitosis is powered by microtubule depolymerization.

Some seniors referred to him as \"Jamanaka\", a pun on the Japanese word for obstacle.[10]/nFrom 1993 to 1996, he was at the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease.

He stated that he could and would clarify the characteristics of embryonic stem cells, and this can-do attitude won him the job.

They could show that his iPS cells were pluripotent, i.e. capable of generating all cell lineages of the body. Later he and his team generated iPS cells from human adult fibroblasts,[3] again as the first group to do so. A key difference from previous attempts by the field was his team's use of multiple transcription factors, instead of transfecting one transcription factor per experiment. They started with 24 transcription factors known to be important in the early embryo, but could in the end reduce it to 4 transcription factors \u2013 Sox2, Oct4, Klf4 and c-Myc.[2]/nThe 2012 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded jointly to Sir John B. Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka \"for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent.\"[8]/nThere are different types of stem cells./nThese are some types of cells that will help in understanding the material./nTheoretically patient-specific transplantations possible/nMuch research done/nImmune rejection reducible via stem cell bank/nPluripotent/nAbnormal aging/nNo immune rejection\nSafe (clinical trials)/nThe prevalent view during the early 20th century was that mature cells were permanently locked into the differentiated state and cannot return to a fully immature, pluripotent stem cell state. It was thought that cellular differentiation can only be a unidirectional process. Therefore, non-differentiated egg/early embryo cells can only develop into specialized cells. However, stem cells with limited potency (adult stem cells) remain in bone marrow, intestine, skin etc. to act as a source of cell replacement.[13]/nThe fact that differentiated cell types had specific patterns of proteins suggested irreversible epigenetic modifications or genetic alterations to be the cause of unidirectional cell differentiation. So, cells progressively become more restricted in the differentiation potential and eventually lose pluripotency.[13]/nIn 1962, John B. Gurdon demonstrated that the nucleus from a differentiated frog intestinal epithelial cell can generate a fully functional tadpole via transplantation to an enucleated egg. Gurdon used somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) as a method to understand reprogramming and how cells change in specialization. He concluded that differentiated somatic cell nuclei had the potential to revert to pluripotency. This was a paradigm shift at the time. It showed that a differentiated cell nucleus has retained the capacity to successfully revert to an undifferentiated state, with the potential to restart development (pluripotent capacity)./nHowever, the question still remained whether an intact differentiated cell could be fully reprogrammed to become pluripotent./nShinya Yamanaka proved that introduction of a small set of transcription factors into a differentiated cell was sufficient to revert the cell to a pluripotent state. \nYamanaka focused on factors that are important for maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem (ES) cells. This was the first time an intact differentiated somatic cell could be reprogrammed to become pluripotent./nKnowing that transcription factors were involved in the maintenance of the pluripotent state, he selected a set of 24 ES cell transcriptional factors as candidates to reinstate pluripotency in somatic cells. First, he collected the 24 candidate factors. When all 24 genes encoding these transcription factors were introduced into skin fibroblasts, few actually generated colonies that were remarkably similar to ES cells.\nSecondly, further experiments were conducted with smaller numbers of transcription factors added to identify the key factors, through a very simple and yet sensitive assay system.\nLastly, he identified the four key genes. They found that 4 transcriptional factors (Myc, Oct3/4, Sox2 and Klf4) were sufficient to convert mouse embryonic or adult fibroblasts to pluripotent stem cells (capable of producing teratomas in vivo and contributing to chimeric mice)./nThese pluripotent cells are called iPS (induced pluripotent stem) cells; they appeared with very low frequency. iPS cells can be selected by inserting the b-geo gene into the Fbx15 locus. The Fbx15 promoter is active in pluripotent stem cells which induce b-geo expression, which in turn gives rise to G418 resistance; this resistance helps us identify the iPS cells in culture./nMoreover, in 2007, Yamanaka and his colleagues found iPS cells with germline transmission (via selecting for Oct4 or Nanog gene). Also in 2007, they were the first to produce human iPS cells./nSome issues that current methods of induced pluripotency face are the very low production rate of iPS cells and the fact that the 4 transcriptional factors are shown to be oncogenic./nIn July 2014, during a scandal involving Japanese stem cell researcher Haruko Obokata fabricating data, doctoring images, and plagiarizing the work of others, Yamanaka faced public scrutiny for his associated work lacking full documentation. Yamanaka denied manipulating images in his papers on embryonic mouse stem cells, but he could not find lab notes to confirm that the raw data was consistent with the published results.[14][15][16]/nSince the original discovery by Yamanaka, much further research has been done in this field, and many improvements have been made to the technology.

Sive is a South African-born biologist and educator. She is Dean of the College of Science, and Professor of Biology at Northeastern University. Sive is a research pioneer, award-winning educator and innovator in the higher education space who was elected as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in November 2021.[1] Prior to June 2020, she was a Member of Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Professor of Biology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Associate Member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Sive studies development of the vertebrate embryo, and has made unique contributions to understanding how the face forms and how the brain develops its structure. Her lab also seeks to understand the origins of neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders,[2] such as epilepsy, autism, Pitt\u2013Hopkins syndrome and 16p11.2 deletion syndrome./nSive received her Bachelor of Science with honors in 1979 from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa with a double major in zoology and chemistry.[3] She left South Africa for England where she taught secondary school science. She then went to the United States for graduate studies in molecular biology under Robert G. Roeder. She received a PhD from Rockefeller University in 1986. Sive was a postdoctoral trainee with Harold Weintraub at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center until 1991./nSive is a pioneer in many research areas and has developed multiple techniques./nThese include analysis of the extreme anterior domain (EAD), a unique and important embryonic region she named.[4] She used a simple anterior organ, the mucus-secreting cement gland of the frog Xenopus, to define the genetic network required for anterior position. The EAD also gives rise to the mouth and the Sive group has defined key steps necessary for mouth formation. Using their 'facial transplant' technique, her group made the unprecedented discovery that the EAD is also a facial signaling center, which guides neural crest cells into the developing face, where they form the jaws and other structures.[5] Since the EAD is present in humans, the work is directly relevant for understanding human craniofacial anomalies./nAnother focus of Sive's research has been nervous system patterning. Using novel techniques in subtractive cloning, her laboratory defined some of the earliest molecular markers and regulators of the nervous system in both Xenopus and the zebrafish Danio. Expression of these genes answered the age-old question of when the embryo decides to make a nervous system: Sive showed that future brain cells are set aside when the embryo is just a ball of cells. Function of these genes, including otx2 and zic1 (opl), was studied using hormone-inducible fusion proteins, a technique first used in embryos by Sive.[6] She also developed the first zebrafish 'explant' culture method, and so identified cell interactions that initiate brain development.[7] As well, Sive identified retinoic acid as a regulator of brain patterning, and demonstrated its activity on expression of hindbrain Hox genes.[8]\nAnd she defined additional roles for fibroblast growth factors in precise patterning of the hindbrain.[9]/nAs structure and function are closely allied, Sive also focuses on how three-dimensional structure of the brain is generated by the processes of morphogenesis. Sive first identified and named \"basal constriction\" as a cell-shape-change occurring during brain morphogenesis.[10] In addition, she identified and named the process of \"epithelial relaxation,\" a cell-sheet-stretching process that occurs as brain ventricles form.[11] Indeed, she pioneered use of zebrafish to study the brain ventricular system\u2014cavities filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that form the body's \"third circulation.\" [12] Using a unique drainage assay, Sive identified Retinol Binding Protein in the CSF as essential for survival of brain cells.[13]/nSive has a long-standing interest in neurodevelopmental disorders, including those relating to mental health. A great challenge is that these disorders often involve multiple genes, whose contributions to a disorder is frequently unclear. Sive pioneered zebrafish as a tool for probing gene function associated with autism spectrum disorders.[14] Her group has identified genes that interact and contribute to brain dysfunction in the prevalent and serious 16p11.2 deletion syndrome, most recently implicating lipid metabolism in symptomatology.[15][16]/nIn running her eponymous lab, she is a faculty member in the Northeastern University Biology department.

In 1940 he became engaged in operational research at the Royal Air Force headquarters; commissioned a squadron leader on 17 September 1941,[5] he was appointed an honorary wing commander on 8 June 1944,[6] and relinquished his commission on 5 June 1945.[7] He was awarded his PhD after the war in 1949.[8]/nDuring the war years, he became increasingly interested in biochemical problems, and decided to work on the structure of proteins./nIn 1945 he approached Max Perutz in the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. Joseph Barcroft, a respiratory physiologist, suggested he might make a comparative protein crystallographic study of adult and fetal sheep haemoglobin, and he started that work./nIn 1947 he became a Fellow of Peterhouse; and the Medical Research Council (MRC) agreed to create a research unit for the study of the molecular structure of biological systems, under the direction of Sir Lawrence Bragg.[citation needed] In 1954 he became a Reader at the Davy-Faraday Laboratory of the Royal Institution in London./nKendrew shared the 1962 Nobel Prize for chemistry with Max Perutz for determining the first atomic structures of proteins using X-ray crystallography. Their work was done at what is now the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. Kendrew determined the structure of the protein myoglobin, which stores oxygen in muscle cells.[9]/nIn 1947 the MRC agreed to make a research unit for the Study of the Molecular Structure of Biological Systems. The original studies were on the structure of sheep haemoglobin, but when this work had progressed as far as was possible using the resources then available, Kendrew embarked on the study of myoglobin, a molecule only a quarter the size of the haemoglobin molecule. His initial source of raw material was horse heart, but the crystals thus obtained were too small for X-ray analysis. Kendrew realized that the oxygen-conserving tissue of diving mammals could offer a better prospect, and a chance encounter led to his acquiring a large chunk of whale meat from Peru. Whale myoglobin did give large crystals with clean X-ray diffraction patterns.[9] However, the problem still remained insurmountable, until in 1953 Max Perutz discovered that the phase problem in analysis of the diffraction patterns could be solved by multiple isomorphous replacement \u2014 comparison of patterns from several crystals; one from the native protein, and others that had been soaked in solutions of heavy metals and had metal ions introduced in different well-defined positions. An electron density map at 6 angstrom (0.6 nanometre) resolution was obtained by 1957, and by 1959 an atomic model could be built at 2 angstrom (0.2\u00a0nm) resolution.[10]/nIn 1963, Kendrew became one of the founders of the European Molecular Biology Organization; as well, he founded and was for many years editor-in-chief of the Journal of Molecular Biology. He became Fellow of the American Society of Biological Chemists in 1967 and honorary member of the International Academy of Science, Munich. In 1974, he succeeded in persuading governments to establish the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg and became its first director.  He was knighted in 1974.[3] From 1974 to 1979, he was a Trustee of the British Museum, and from 1974 to 1988 he was successively Secretary General, Vice-President, and President of the International Council of Scientific Unions./nAfter his retirement from EMBL, Kendrew became President of St John's College at the University of Oxford, a post he held from 1981 to 1987.  In his will, he designated his bequest to St John's College for studentships in science and in music, for students from developing countries.  The Kendrew Quadrangle at St John's College in Oxford, officially opened on 16 October 2010, is named after him.[11]/nKendrew was married to the former Elizabeth Jarvie (n\u00e9e Gorvin) from 1948 to 1956.  Their marriage ended in divorce.

His own studies of the chick embryo culminated in the book \"Interacting Systems in Development\", which was published in six languages. As Director of the Department of Embryology of The Carnegie Institution of Washington located on the Baltimore Hopkins campus, he pushed the institution out of the age of specimen collecting into the modern era of genetic research.  His most important contribution to embryology was in his early investigation of the \"graft-host\" reaction. This seminal work would comprise the first blocks in the foundation for the modern medical industry of organ transplants and set the stage for stem cell research. During his long career he was a professor at Indiana University, MIT, Johns Hopkins University, a Vice President of The National Academy of Sciences,[2] a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,[3] a member of the American Philosophical Society,[4] President of the Carnegie Institution of Washington (1978\u20131987), and President and Director of The Marine Biological Laboratory[5] in Woods Hole, Massachusetts where he and his wife Alma had remained in some capacity for over fifty years.

In 1991 she started work at the Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, first as a post-doc and subsequently as a group leader. In 1995, she was jointly appointed as Professor of Cancer Research in the Faculty of Biological Sciences at the University of Glasgow and the Beatson Institute, where she became Deputy Director in 2002.[2]/nIn October 2007 she joined the new MRC-University of Edinburgh Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine. She co-directs the Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre in Edinburgh University\u2019s College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, with the role of Science Director in the Cancer Research UK Centre (established January 2010). The vision of the Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre is to develop novel and emerging technologies for the development of innovative cancer discovery and translational science. Together with colleagues, she formed the Edinburgh Cancer Discovery Unit, which aims to generate evidence-led tests for cancer therapeutics and combinations that will predict clinical efficacy.[2]/nMargaret Frame\u2019s long-held research interests are in cancer invasion and metastasis, and the role of tyrosine kinases in controlling tumour cell spread. She has had several CR-UK funded programs of research to work on understanding cancer invasion and metastasis and was awarded a European Research Council Advanced Investigator grant to build a novel cancer discovery platform. Her main goal is to work with clinicians treating cancers of unmet need, to determine whether targeting the invasive and metastatic processes may be of therapeutic benefit, and may be monitored in the preclinical and clinical settings by novel imaging techniques.[2]/nHer research group works on cell adhesion networks in cancer, with specific focus on the regulation and role of the adhesion-linked \u2018nodal\u2019 Tyrosine Kinases, and their extensive network of interacting partners. In particular Src and FAK kinases reside at sites of cell interaction with the environment or neighbouring cells, and her group is studying their wider cellular roles.\u00a0They are also studying other proteins that have cancer-specific adaptor functions because they interact with the Src/FAK pathway in adhesion-regulated complexes, or they function in invasion or metastasis. Typically, these proteins regulate a variety of processes that lie at the heart of cancer,  epithelial plasticity, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), loss of tissue regulation and tissue architecture, self-renewing properties, resistance to therapy, invasion and metastasis and host-tumour interactions.[3]/nHer group has shown that the FERM domain of FAK interacts with key regulators of directional migration and cancer cell polarity, and that tumour progression requires FAK in multiple epithelial cancer types. They have also demonstrated that Src inhibition suppresses metastasis in a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer, and have been able to generate extremely useful cells from cancer models that are FAK deficient, and which can be reconstituted with wild-type FAK or signalling mutants. These have allowed the group to determine the role of signalling through FAK, from integrins and from the upstream Src kinases, and via FAK\u2019s kinase activity, in maintaining aspects of the cancer phenotype. These have led to several findings on control of E-cadherin dynamics in vitro and in vivo, and on proliferation in 3-dimensional environments. Perhaps the most striking new finding from their genetic deletion studies (in both cells and animal tissues), has been that integrin signalling through the Src/FAK axis regulates autophagy in advanced cancer cells.[4]/nMargaret Frame's research group is now working with Professor Valerie Brunton, extending her research into glioblastoma to find out how these same networks are involved in this complex disease. A major part involves studying glioblastoma stem cells looking for differences in their adhesion networks, how these may play a role in the disease and how glioblastoma stem cells interact with immune cells and influence their surroundings. Through this work, they also hope to reveal new drug targets.[5]/nMargaret Frame was awarded the Tenovus Medal in 1999 for her work on Src family kinases, was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2002, an EMBO Member in 2008 and a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences in 2010.[2]/nShe was awarded an OBE in the New Years Honours of 2018 for services to cancer research.[6][7]", "63329003": "For the American folk singer and songwriter, see Nancy Ames./nNancy Ames is a Canadian scientist with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada[1] known for her research on the nutrition and quality of cereals and pulses.[2] She works closely with plant scientists to maximize the health benefits of new varieties and ensure that these benefits are maintained when the crops are harvested and processed.

Ames contributed to information supporting a barley health claim in the United States, which was approved in 2006.[12] In 2007, she initiated a similar approach in Canada with hopes of transforming barley into a mainstream food product in addition to its use as animal feed and in making beer and ale.[13][14] She invited a large group of barley stakeholders, including breeders, growers, processors, food scientists, nutritionists and others, to discuss the idea of a similar Canadian barley health claim. With their support, Ames and members of her laboratory took a leadership role in the detailed process of preparing a health claim petition, which was submitted by the Alberta Barley Commission, as a representative of the barley industry, to Health Canada in February 2009. In July 2012, Health Canada approved the health claim that barley fibre reduces cholesterol and risk of heart disease.[15][16] During this process, she also identified and completed supplementary research to support this claim.[17][5]/nAmes has contributed significantly in the area of food product development.

She has been an active member of the American Association of Cereal Chemists International and has served on the scientific advisory boards for the Healthy Grains Institute and the Quaker Oats Center of Excellence.[1][10]/nAmes also studies how processing affects the functionality and health benefits of grain and pulse based foods.[1] To accomplish this, she has also helped develop analytical and in vitro methods to predict health benefits[10][24] and leads collaborative studies including clinical trials. In 2016, her lab acquired a \"model\" or \"artificial\" stomach which mimics the digestive processes of the human stomach and upper intestine. Her team has used the stomach to test the digestive properties of wheat, oats, chickpeas and lentils and how ingredient ratios, serving size, processing and cooking methods impact digestion.

During his time at Kyoto, he studied abroad at the Carnegie Institute Department of Embryology for a fellowship. In 2000, he was appointed as Director of the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology (RIKEN CDB).[3]/nIn 1977 Takeichi discovered cadherin, and since then he has contributed to clarify its functions in tissue construction and to understand the molecular mechanisms of cell adhesion.[2] After his discovery of cadherins, he continued to research cadherins and their properties. Along with cadherins, he also researched cell junctions and adhesions. He continues to research at RIKEN today./nWhile first working in Kyoto, Takeichi was using trypsin to study cell adhesions and aggregation. Once he moved to the Carnegie Institution, he realized the trypsin he was using behaved differently. This trypsin solution contained EDTA, along with the trypsin, which disturbed adhesion. The EDTA sequesters calcium ions, so Takeichi began testing for adhesion dependent on calcium. He used Chinese Hamster V79 cells and treated them with a variety of treatments, including EDTA, trypsin + EDTA, and trypsin + calcium. Once treated, these cells were tested for aggregation levels. He found that both calcium dependent and calcium independent pathways existed, and that the calcium treatment prevent trypsin's effects on the cell.[1]/nTakeichi knew there was calcium dependent molecule that served an important role, but he had to find it. Rolf Kemler's anti serum was what helped him finally identify cadherin. E-cadherin was the first of the cadherin family to be discovered. During this research, Takeichi also observed changes in the morphology of the cells involved with adhesions. He accurately hypothesized that the adhesions dependent on calcium played a role in managing cells' morphogenetic behavior. His discovery of the cadherin family led to a developing field of studying adhesions pathways.[1]/nTakeichi, along with other scientists, studied the mechanism behind hemagglutinin from Botulism and its effect on the epithelial barrier of the intestines. They found the hemagglutinin directly interacted with the e-cadherin in the epithelial cells to disturbed cell to cell adhesion. This interaction like cell to cell adhesion is dependent on calcium ions. An assay showed the hemaglutinin interaction is specific to e-cadherin.[4]/nOutside of cadherin, Takeichi studied other molecules involved with cell adhesion and beyond. He studied alpha-catenin functions outside of their functions within cell adhesion. The results showed alpha-catenin have a variety of functions outside of cadherin and adhesion. It regulates multiple different molecules, like actin and RhoGEF.[5]", "35181361": "Yuri Semenovich Lazurkin (1916 - August 5, 2009) was a Russian physicist and a founder of a new discipline DNA physics.[1]/nLazurkin started his career[1] in a novel field polymer physics.

He pioneered the capture and study of live sharks and for several decades was considered one of the world's foremost experts on shark anatomy and behavior. Over the course of his life, Gilbert published two books and approximately 150 scientific papers. As a recipient of both Carnegie and Guggenheim Fellowships and chair of the American Institute of Biological Sciences' Shark Research Panel, Gilbert travelled the world to better learn and understand shark behavior./nGilbert was born December 1, 1912, to Scott and Hester Gilbert in North Branford, Connecticut.[1] He also had a sister, two years younger, named Eleanor. When Gilbert was a child, the family would frequently spend time on the seashore, developing in him an early appreciation for marine life that would be reignited in his academic career. His father Scott, a carpenter and homebuilder, would take Gilbert fishing, treading for clams, and tonging for oysters.[2]/nAs a child, Gilbert started his schooling in a one-room schoolhouse in his hometown of North Branford, but his mother ultimately proved to be dissatisfied with the quality of the education that the school provided. She sent him to a school of 600 students in New Haven, Connecticut, about 10 miles away by trolley. While he was initially labeled as a \"hick\" by his classmates, Gilbert would often invite classmates to his family's farm and by his last year in school he had become the class president.[2]/nEventually, Gilbert's parents were forced to sell the family home to make way for a new city reservoir, and the Gilberts relocated to nearby Branford, a town on the coast of Long Island Sound. As Gilbert continued his education at Branford High School, he spent his free time collecting wildlife specimens, including butterflies and moths, often studying books on them. He also spent his summers working at a cemetery digging graves and mowing lawns, during which time he learned much from the sexton's father about budding roses, grafting plants, and raising evergreens. Upon graduating high school, Gilbert was accepted into Dartmouth College, and - although his father's business had been destroyed by the Depression - his aunt was able to provide funding for his college education.[2]/nGilbert initially entered Dartmouth College in 1930, studying both vertebrate anatomy under Professor William Ballard and histology and embryology under Professor Norman Arnold.[1] He graduated in 1934 with a bachelor's degree in zoology, and continued on at Dartmouth as an instructor for two years.[2] In 1936, Gilbert decided to pursue his Ph.D. and with financial support from a Cramer Fellowship he started his doctoral research on comparative anatomy of burrowing and terrestrial sciurid mammals at Cornell University.[2] Under the advisement of mammalogist William J. Hamilton II, Gilbert achieved his doctorate in 1940 and was immediately hired as in instructor in Cornell's Department of Zoology by Chairman Benjamin Young.[1]/nGilbert ended up having a long career at Cornell, and was continuously affiliated with the University for 64 years. He began as an instructor, being promoted to an assistant professor in 1943, a tenured associate professor in 1946, and ultimately to a professor of zoology from 1952 to 1978. Thereafter, Gilbert served as a professor of Neurobiology and Behavior, Emeritus.[2] He taught Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy during fall, spring, and often summer terms from 1940 to 1967, a course which was known for its large enrollment as it was a requirement for entrance to most medical schools.[1][2] During World War II, Gilbert taught comparative anatomy to the pre-medical corps of the U.S. Army and Navy for six days a week, every week for a year except Christmas Day.[2]/nGilbert was known among the student population for drawing multi-colored, symmetrical drawings on the chalkboard using both hands simultaneously, and for giving summative philosophical thoughts at the end of each lecture.[1][2] He also kept a collection of note cards with details on every one of his students, which he used to remember particulars of over 5000 students in the course of his career.[2] During Gilbert's time at Cornell, the university underwent a departmental reorganization that resulted in the formation of the Division of Biological Sciences, in which Gilbert chose to join the new Section of Neurobiology and Behavior, which is now the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior.[2]/nRobert Hueter, Senior Scientist, Director of the Center of Shark Research, and Perry W. Gilbert Chair in Shark Research at Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium, has written that \"Thousands of professionals in the biological sciences today - and certainly those in comparative anatomy, functional morphology, neurobiology and even ichthyology - can trace their roots to some relationship with Perry Gilbert the teacher\".[2]/nSoon after arriving at Cornell, Gilbert met Claire Rachel Kelly in Hamilton's mammalogy class.[1][2] She was pursuing her bachelor's at Cornell, and on September 3, 1938, the two were married.[3] The couple began their married life in Ithaca on Linden Avenue in Collegetown, later moved to a farm on Coddington Road, and eventually settled on the Parkway.[1] When Gilbert gained his position as Director of Mote Marine Laboratory in 1967, the Gilberts relocated from Ithaca to Sarasota.[3] They had eight children together, including five sons - David, Stephen, John, Christopher, and Philip - and three daughters - Ann, Mary, and Lois.[4] The family also owned a farmhouse on the Danby Hills, known as \"the Nob\" which served as a seasonal vacation retreat as well as a site for social gatherings of Gilbert's colleagues, students, and friends.[1]/nClaire Kelly Gilbert edited Gilbert's publications and co-authored several of them.[1] Claire learned Russian and Italian in order to translate scientific treatises on sharks.[3] In Sarasota, she volunteered at St. Vincent de Paul Thrift Shop and sang alto in the choir at Incarnation Church. Following the death of her husband, Claire sold the home in Siesta Key in 2002 and moved to an Ithacare Community in Ithaca called Longview. She died of a stroke at the age of 92.[3]/nEarly on, Gilbert's academic work varied widely in nature. Gilbert's first published academic paper, initially penned in 1935 during his time at Dartmouth, focused on the structure and function of avian lungs and air sacs; this paper was ultimately published in 1939. He went on to write his 1940 doctoral dissertation on the anatomy of burrowing squirrels, particularly the woodchuck.[1]/nIn 1949, Gilbert took his first sabbatical as a Carnegie Fellow in Embryology.[1] He worked with Dr. George Corner at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and ultimately this fellowship resulted in several publications including an illustrated monograph on the origin and development of the human extrinsic eye muscles.[1][2]/nAs a professor, Gilbert oversaw the dissections of many animal specimens but took special interest in the biology of dogfish sharks.[4] Here his interest in shark biology appears to have begun. Gilbert's first published paper on sharks was focused specifically on the male urogenital system of the frilled shark, published in Copeia in 1941. He supplemented this first article two years later with an additional paper on the male frilled shark anatomy, published in the Journal of Morphology in 1943.[2] Gilbert's interest and expertise in sharks grew over the course of his career, growing to dominate his academic work in the coming decades./nGilbert went on to study male spiny dogfish and smooth dogfish at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts in the mid-1950s, resulting in papers about the functional morphology of shark claspers and siphon sacs.[2] The late 1950s, and 1957 in particular, proved to be fruitful for Gilbert's emerging shark research. During 1957 and 1958, he studied at Mt. Desert Island Biological Laboratory in Maine, using radioactive tracers to observe the transfer of nutrients between mothers and embryos in spiny dogfish. This work was accomplished with the help of his eldest son, David, who was a student at Harvard at the time.[2] In 1957, Gilbert and his colleague F. G. Wood made a breakthrough while conducting research at Marineland in Florida, and inventing an anesthetic named MS 222 that could be sprayed into the gills of large sharks, ultimately publishing a widely cited paper on the subject in Science in 1957.[4][2] Gilbert went on his second sabbatical in 1957, with the support of a Guggenheim Fellowship, studying sharks at the Lerner Marine Laboratory in Bimini.[1]/nOver the course of his career, Gilbert conducted research - primarily shark-focused, but also including other marine life - at a wide array of research facilities, including: the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts; Mt. Desert Island Biological Laboratory in Maine; Lerner Marine Laboratory in the Bahamas; Cape Haze Marine Laboratory in Florida (which later became Mote Marine Laboratory, under Gilbert's directorship: see below); Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California; and various other labs in Florida, Hawaii, South Africa, Australia, Japan, and the South Seas. During his career, Gilbert also led scientific expeditions in Tahiti and British Honduras.[2]/nGilbert's growing expertise around sharks eventually drew the attention of the Office of Naval Research (ONR). Concurrently with Gilbert's research efforts, ONR was funding research around methods for repelling shark attacks, which had been reported as a problem for shipwrecked navy personnel and downed pilots during World War II. In 1957, Sid Galler of ONR approached Gilbert and asked him to serve as the chair of the American Institute of Biological Sciences' ONR-funded Shark Research Panel.[2]/nAs the chair of the Shark Research Panel, Gilbert was tasked with traveling around the world to encourage, coordinate, and direct programs in shark research, as well as to conduct his own research as needed. While the ONR work had initially been specifically focused on developing some sort of shark repellent, Gilbert helped convince them to \"support a broad program in basic research, opening the door to a new era of scientific studies on sharks around the world\".[2]/nBetween 1960 and 1969, Gilbert authored more than 40 scientific articles on sharks, including research relating to sharks' vision, bite force, chemoreception, attack behavior, and methods for repelling them.[2] Gilbert's early work with ONR also resulted in the publication of the edited volume \"Sharks and Survival\" (1963), a collection of peer-reviewed papers with contributions from experts in the field.[2]/nAs a part of his work with the Shark Research Panel, Gilbert helped to plan and coordinate two major symposia on shark research. One of these symposia was held at Lerner Marine Laboratory in the Bahamas. The symposium collected 70 researchers, twelve of whom were affiliated with Mt. Desert Island Biological Laboratory (MDIBL), where Gilbert had done work himself in the late 1950s.[5] The result of this symposium was the edited volume \"Sharks, Skates, and Rays,\" published in 1967, which included papers on shark anatomy, physiology, taxonomy, and life history.[2]/nAccording to Robert Hueter, \"practically every thread of contemporary research on the biology and behavior of sharks since 1960 can be traced back to the ONR program guided by the scholarly leadership of Perry Gilbert\".[2]/nIn 1955, the Vanderbilt family established the Cape Haze Marine Laboratory in Placida, Florida and placed it under the direction of Eugenie Clark. Clark oversaw the movement of the laboratory from Placida to Siesta Key in 1960.[2] By 1965, however, Clark decided to resign her directorship for personal reasons and the position was open to fill. After two interim directors and a generous contribution from William R. Mote to keep the laboratory afloat, Gilbert was approached by the search committee to be the new director of what would become Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium.[2] During the early-to-mid 1960s, Gilbert had carried on much of his research here as a visiting fellow, and was well known by the deciding board.[1] When offered the position in 1967, Gilbert only agreed to work as an interim director.[2] He ultimately maintained his professorship at Cornell by returning to Ithaca for some weeks each year to give lectures and consult with students and colleagues; in return, Cornell gained from policies that allowed students and faculty to access Mote Laboratory's equipment and research facilities.[1] His position as director of Mote was soon changed from Interim Director to Permanent Director [2]/nUnder Gilbert's leadership, the laboratory became known as a center of excellence in a variety of marine research disciplines, not least of which related to shark research.[1] Funding from ONR allowed for the construction of a large, elaborate shark-holding facility, which provided new opportunities for the observation and study of life sharks in safe and controlled conditions for the first time.[2] Meanwhile, Gilbert continued his own research and published many papers with the help of collaborators, stimulating others to follow suit.[2]/nGilbert also expanded the scope of Mote's research to include biomedicine, microbiology, neurobiology and behavior, ecology, and environmental health by inviting specialists in these fields to work as visiting investigators at Mote. He used contacts that he had cultivated over his 30-year career to help boost the reputation and breadth of research in the facility, often soliciting experts from other universities, museums, and the National Institutes of Health.[2]/nIn the mid-1970s, it became clear that the laboratory would need to be moved once again due to various problems, including coastal erosion of the Siesta Key.[1] Gilbert took on the planning, design, local politicking, and fundraising for the move, and oversaw the creation of Mote's current facility on City Island in Sarasota, Florida.[1][2] The new facility was much larger, with further growth in mind. Following this move, Gilbert retired as Director in 1978./nUpon his retirement as Director of Mote Marine Laboratory in 1978, Gilbert continued to work as Mote Senior Scientist and member of the board of trustees. A new education building was named in his honor, and the endowed \"Perry W. Gilbert Chair in Shark Research\" was established. When he retired from Cornell, he was honored with a symposium of distinguished speakers, a banquet, and the establishment of an endowed \"Perry Gilbert Lectureship in Comparative Anatomy and Behavior\".[1]/nPerry Gilbert died on October 15, 2000, at his home in Sarasota, FL.[4]", "1135434": "Peter K.

Lippincott-Schwartz received her PhD from Johns Hopkins University, and performed post-doctoral training with Richard Klausner at the NICHD, NIH in Bethesda, Maryland.[2]/nLippincott-Schwartz's research revealed that the organelles of eukaryotic cells are dynamic, self-organized structures that constantly regenerate themselves through intracellular vesicle traffic, rather than static structures.[2][3]  She is also a pioneer in developing live cell imaging techniques to study the dynamic interactions of molecules in cells, including photobleaching and photoactivation[4] techniques which allow investigation of subcellular localization, mobility, transport routes, and turnover of important cellular proteins related to membrane trafficking and compartmentalization.  Lippincott-Schwartz's lab also tests mechanistic hypotheses related to protein and organelle functions and dynamics by utilizing quantitative measurements through kinetic modeling and simulation experiments.[5] Along with Craig Blackstone, Lippincott-Schwartz utilized advanced imaging techniques to reveal a more accurate picture of how the peripheral endoplasmic reticulum is structured. Their findings may yield new insights for genetic diseases affecting proteins that help shape the endoplasmic reticulum.[6] Additionally, Lippincott-Schwartz's laboratory demonstrated that Golgi enzymes constitutively recycle back to the endoplasmic reticulum and that such recycling plays a central role in the maintenance, biogenesis, and inheritance of the Golgi apparatus in mammalian cells.[7]/nWithin Lippincott-Schwartz lab, current projects include several cell biological areas.  For example, protein transport and cytoskeleton interaction, organelle assembly and disassembly, and cell polarity generation.  There are also projects analyzing the dynamics of proteins that have been fluorescently labeled.  These proteins are labeled using several live cell imaging techniques such as FRAP, FCS, and photoactivation.[8]/nLippincott-Schwartz has dedicated her most recent lab research to photoactivation localization microscopy (PALM), which allows the viewing of molecular distributions of high densities at the nano-scale.[2]/nJennifer Lippincott-Schwartz was born on October 19, 1952, in Manhattan, Kansas.  Her father was a professor of physical chemistry at the University of Maryland[9] and a periodic table could be found hanging in her family's household kitchen.  Lippincott-Schwartz's exposure to her father's work is what sparked her love of science.  The family moved to a farm in Northern Virginia that had several horses and various other animals.  This is where Lippincott-Schwartz found her love of biology./nLippincott-Schwartz attended Swarthmore College, where she majored in psychology and philosophy and graduated with honors from Swarthmore College in 1974.[2] She taught science at a girl's high school in Kenya for two years before returning to the USA and entering a Master's program in Biology at Stanford University where she worked on DNA repair in the laboratory of Philip Hanawalt.[2] She then entered a Biochemistry Ph.D. program at Johns Hopkins University, where she worked in Douglas Fambrough's lab in the Carnegie Institution of Embryology[2] and studied the dynamics of lysosomal membrane proteins.[10][11]/nAfter graduating from Johns Hopkins in 1986, Lippincott-Schwartz joined Richard D. Klausner's lab at the National Institutes of Health. Using the drug brefeldin A to perturb membrane trafficking, she showed that membranes cycle between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi,[12][13] leading to a recognition that cellular organelles are dynamic, self-organized structures that constantly regenerate themselves through intracellular vesicle traffic.[3][14]/nLippincott-Schwartz became a staff fellow at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development at NIH in 1990.  During this time, Lippincott-Schwartz began developing techniques to use green fluorescent protein (GFP) to visualize cellular trafficking pathways in living cells.[2][15] She refined the technique of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to use in studying the dynamics of membrane proteins.  In this method, GFP-tagged membrane proteins are subjected to photobleaching in a small area of the cell, and then the cell is imaged to discover how long it takes for non-bleached proteins to replace the bleached ones, i.e. how long it takes for the fluorescence to recover. Before this work, it was thought that the membrane proteins in organelles such as the ER, Golgi, and plasma membrane were fixed in place.  However, the FRAP technique proved that molecules within cells move quite rapidly and are able to diffuse freely.[16]  Lippincott-Schwartz subsequently introduced photoactivatable GFP that increases its fluorescence after irradiation.[4] This allowed Lippincott-Schwartz and her post-doc George Patterson to track the transport of cargo molecules through the Golgi with great precision,[17] leading to the realization that cargo transport is not an ordered sequential process; instead, the apparently separate membranous stacks of the Golgi are a single continuous structure, and proteins rapidly equilibrate through the layers.[18]/nLippincott-Schwartz's work on photoactivatable GFP led to a collaboration with Eric Betzig of Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Janelia Farm Research Campus in which the ability to turn GFP fluorescence on and off was used to develop one of the first \"superresolution imaging\" technologies, photoactivation localization microscopy (PALM).[19] The development of \"super-resolved fluorescence microscopy\" was recognized in 2014 by the award of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Eric Betzig along with William E. Moerner of Stanford University, and Stefan W. Hell of Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry.[20][21]/nLippincott-Schwartz has used PALM to assess the stoichiometry and composition of membrane receptors[22] and has collaborated with Vladislav Verkhusha of Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York to develop two-color PALM.[23] She used a combination of five super-resolution techniques to show that the endoplasmic reticulum is composed of a dense tubular matrix, instead of the sheets seen at lower resolution.[24]/nIn 2016, Lippincott-Schwartz moved from NIH to the Janelia Research Campus of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to initiate the Neuronal Cell Biology Program at Janelia.[1]", "70570844": "Jelena Begovi\u0107 (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0408\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0411\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b; born 1970) is a Serbian molecular biologist serving as the minister of science, technological development and innovation since 2022./nBegovi\u0107 was born in Belgrade, in what was then the Socialist Republic of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

While testing the Delta-24-RGD treatment with scientists at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, their research teams found that the treatment would completely eradicate brain tumors in mice, while leaving healthy brain tissue alone.[13] He also founded VectorLogics, Inc. in order to develop products to treat ovarian cancer.[14] In 2004, Curiel was a finalist for the Director position at the University of Arizona's Institute for Biomedical Science and Biotechnology.[5] However, he chose to remain at UAB until 2011 when he became Director of Washington University in St. Louis' (WUSTL) Biologic Therapeutics Center.[15] During his final years at UAB, Scientific American magazine deemed Curiel's 2003 co-authored paper on virotherapy as \"one of 10 groundbreaking stories of the past 10 years.\"[16][17]/nUpon joining the faculty at WUSTL in 2011, Curiel was appointed a professor of radiation oncology with tenure.[18] He also merged his company VectorLogics, Inc. with DNAtrix, a biotechnology company developing targeted adenovirus-based oncolytic virus products for brain cancer.[14] In 2012, Curiel collaborated with scientist Mike Mathis from LSU to test the adenovirus on colon cancer in mice.[19] These experiments resulted in the discovery that the adenovirus could target tumor blood vessels in mice without affecting healthy tissues.[20] His use of viral vector technology to optimize the immune system's response to vaccines earned him one of the 2015 Bear Cub Challenge award from the Skandalaris Center for Interdisciplinary Innovation and Entrepreneurship.[21] Due to the 2015\u201316 Zika virus epidemic, Curiel and Precision Virologics commercialized an adenovirus vaccine to prevent the disease and others.[22] In 2019, he received funding from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences to support his research into discovering new therapeutics for genetic diseases.[23] This eventually developed into a new approach to facilitate the \"CAR-T\" immunotherapy that makes it cheaper and more patient-accessible.[24]/nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Curiel harnessed gene therapy and viral vectors to develop therapeutics and vaccines to combat the novel coronavirus.[25] Early in the pandemic, Curiel and Michael S. Diamond re-engineered Adenovirus to carry the Sars-Covid2 spike gene in order to protect against infection and sterilize the upper airways. Their single-dose, nasal vaccine was proven successful in mice and nonhuman primates which led them to begin trials in India with Bharat Biotech.[26][27] Curiel was later named a senior member of the National Academy of Inventors for his gene-therapy research.[28] In late January 2023, the nasal vaccine received approval from India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Science and Technology Minister Jitendra Singh to be added to the primary 2-dose schedule.[29]", "39998319": "Andrew N.

By the age of four she had started collecting ladybird beetles and caterpillars and taking a tame quail to bed with her. World War I broke on the eve of Miriam's sixth birthday in 1914, while the Rothschilds were holidaying in Austro-Hungary. They hurried home on the first westward train but, unable to pay, had to borrow money from a Hungarian passenger who commented \"This is the proudest moment of my life. Never did I think that I should be asked to lend money to a Rothschild!\" Her father took his own life when she was 15, after which she became closer to her uncle. She was educated at home until the age of 17, when she demanded to go to school. She thence attended evening classes in zoology at Chelsea College of Science and Technology and classes during the day in literature at Bedford College, London.[5]/nDuring World War II, Rothschild was recruited to work at Bletchley Park on codebreaking with Alan Turing and was awarded a Defence Medal from the British government for her efforts.[6] Additionally, she pressed the UK Government to admit more German Jews as refugees from Nazi Germany.[7] She arranged housing for 49 Jewish children, some of whom stayed at her home at Ashton Wold.[8][7] The estate also served as a hospital for wounded military personnel, including her future husband, Captain George Lane. Lane, a Hungarian-born British soldier, had changed his name from Lanyi in case of enemy capture.[9][1] They had six children, four biological: Mary Rozsiska (1945\u20132010), Charles Daniel (born 1948), Charlotte Teresa (born 1951) and Johanna Miriam (born 1951);[10] and two adopted.[11] The marriage was dissolved in 1957 but the pair remained on good terms.[9]/nRothschild was a vegetarian and had a close connection to her pets and wild animals that she befriended.[12] Rothschild supported many social causes including animal welfare,[9] free milk for children in schools,[7] and gay rights by contributing to the Wolfenden Report which resulted in decriminalising \"homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private\".[8]/nDuring the 1930s Rothschild made a name for herself at the Marine Biological Station in Plymouth, studying the mollusc Nucula and its trematode parasites (Rothschild 1936, 1938a, 1938b)./nRothschild was a leading authority on fleas. She was the first person to work out the flea's jumping mechanism. She also studied the flea's reproductive cycle and linked this, in rabbits, to the hormonal changes within the host. Her New Naturalist book on parasitism (Fleas, Flukes and Cuckoos) was a huge success. Its title can be explained as: external parasites (e.g. fleas), internal parasites (e.g. flukes) and others (the cuckoo is a 'brood parasite'). Along with Professor G. Harris, Rothschild determined that myxomatosis, a virus affecting tapeti and brush rabbits, was spread by fleas, not mosquitoes as previously understood.[2] The Rothschild Collection of Fleas (founded by Charles Rothschild) is now part of the Natural History Museum collection and her six-volume catalogue of the collection (in collaboration with G. H. E. Hopkins and illustrated by Arthur Smith) took thirty years to complete.[2]/nIn addition to her work on fleas and other parasites, Rothschild studied insects in the order Lepidoptera. Specifically, she was interested in chemical ecology and mimicry. To learn more about mimicry and its role in Lepidopteran predation by birds, Rothschild adapted greenhouses on her Ashton Wold estate to serve as aviaries for owls and other potential predators. This led to further work to identify the compounds synthesized by insects such as Burnet moth and collaboration with Tadeusz Reichstein to show that a monarch butterfly's toxicity comes from milkweed, its larval host plant.[2] It also resulted in work to demonstrate the importance of plant-derived carotenoids in insect coloration. Rothschild discovered that Large white cabbage butterfly caterpillars fed a diet without carotenoids did not match their background as they typically would and Monarch butterfly caterpillars' pupae had silver threads instead of gold.[2]/nAnother area of Lepidoptera research that Rothschild pursued was that of the production of antibiotics by butterflies.[13] This work was initially inspired by observations Rothschild made during an anthrax outbreak in the 1930s, but did not begin in earnest until around 60 years later. Rothschild drafted a manuscript on the subject and the results were eventually published 12 years after her death. [13]/nRothschild was a member of the Oxford genetics school during the 1960s, where she met the ecological geneticist E.B. Ford.[14]/nRothschild authored books about her father (Rothschild's Reserves \u2013 time and fragile nature) and her uncle (Dear Lord Rothschild). She wrote about 350 papers on entomology, zoology and other subjects./nLater in her career, Rothschild grew interested in hay meadow restoration. In response to a comment that it would take 1,000 years to reproduce a medieval meadow, she said \"I could make a very good imitation in ten...it took me fifteen.\"[15] She developed multiple seed mixes on her Ashton Wold estate, including one she called \"Farmer's Nightmare\".

He continued his studies at the Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Berlin where his thesis on the chemistry of protein urine tests earned him his doctorate.[1] He was on active duty as a military physician until 1882, continuing then as a reservist./nFrom 1877 to 1879 he was assigned to the Imperial Health Office (German: Kaiserliches Gesundheitsamt) in Berlin, where he became an assistant to Robert Koch. On the suggestion of Angelina Hesse, the New York-born wife of another assistant, Walther Hesse, the Koch laboratory began to culture bacteria on agar plates. Petri then invented the standard culture dish, or Petri plate,[2] and further developed the technique of agar culture to purify or clone bacterial colonies derived from single cells. This advance made it possible to rigorously identify the bacteria responsible for diseases./nPetri\u2019s first wife, Anna Riesch, died in 1894 during childbirth. In 1897, he married Elizabeth Turk.[1]/nPetri dishes are used as research plates for microbiology studies. The dish is partially filled with warm liquid containing agar, and a mixture of specific ingredients that may include nutrients, blood, salts, carbohydrates, dyes, indicators, amino acids and antibiotics. After the agar cools and solidifies, the dish is ready to receive a microbe-laden sample in a process known as inoculation or \"plating\". For virus or phage cultures, a two-step inoculation is needed: bacteria that is grown acts like a host for the viral inoculum./nThe bacterial sample is diluted on the plate in a process called \"streaking\": a sterile plastic stick, or a wire loop which is sterilized by heating it, the loop is used to collect the first sample, and then make a streak on the dish with the agar. Then, using a fresh stick and sterilized loop, they pass the new loop through that initial streak, and it spreads the plated bacteria onto the dish. This process is repeated a third time, and if necessary a fourth, resulting in individual bacterial cells that are isolated on the plate, which then are capable to divide and grow into single \"clonal\" bacterial colonies.[3]/nPetri plates can be incubated upside down (agar on top), which can help lessen the risk of contamination from airborne particles settling and to decrease and prevent the chance of condensation from water, from accumulating and disturbing the microbes being cultured./nScientists have long been growing cells in natural and synthetic matrix environments to elicit phenotypes that are not expressed on conventionally rigid substrates. Unfortunately, growing cells either on or within soft matrices can be an expensive, labor-intensive, and impractical undertaking./nThe basic design of the Petri dish has not changed since being created by Petri in 1887.[4] They were struggling to keep the dishes free of dust and extra bacteria that could collect and alter their samples, so they were using heavy bell jars which proved ineffective, after 6 years Petri created transparent plates that were slightly larger than his Petri dishes so it could act as a transparent lid.[4]/nAfter his work inventing the Petri dish, Petri left Koch's laboratory and ran the G\u00f6bersdorf sanatorium for Tuberculosis patients from the years 1882 to 1885.[5] After running the G\u00f6bersdorf sanatorium he became the director of the Museum of Hygiene in Berlin in the year 1886.[5] Not only did Petri have many innovations and inventions, but Petri also published many different papers.

He was the son of Sigismund Steinitz (1845-1889), a merchant, and Augustin Cohn Steinitz (1850-1906); brother of the mathematician Ernst Steinitz (1871\u20131928); and also brother of the lawyer Kurt Steinitz (1872-1929).[1]/nHe studied medicine in the Universities of Breslau and Rostock, Germany, and obtained his medical doctoral degree (M.D.) from the University of Rostock in 1905. Following his return to Breslau he earned his living as a cardiologist, and at the same time he also studied zoology. These studies were interrupted temporarily during World War I by service as a physician in the German army. After the war, being interested especially in marine organisms, he wrote a doctoral thesis on the development of the eye in the humpback whale and obtained a Ph.D. degree from the University of Breslau (now University of Wroclaw) in 1918.[2] In recognition of his first and leading research of the marine fauna of the Eastern Mediterranean Basin,[3][4] the Breslau University granted him a position as Privatdozent and lecturer in zoology.[2]/nWalter Steinitz\u2019s first wife, Marta Schindler (1887-1924), was mother of his three sons. After he became a widower he married Alma Friedlander (1887-1977).[1]/nThe rise at the beginning of 1933 of the Nazi regime brought an end to both his medical and academic career.  He immediately recognized there was no future for a reasonable life as a Jew in Germany. Consequently, he emigrated that same year, together with his wife Alma, to Palestine. He joined a group of Jewish German-born settlers who together founded in 1933 Ramot HaShavim, a village organized as an agricultural commune. For five years (1933-1938) he was member of the leading committee of the village. In 1939 he chaired the committee for less than a year. He was a highly educated person, a polymath with wide interests in the fields of life sciences, geology, philosophy and music. With his skills and experience as teacher, he led courses and gave lectures in the village on biological and agricultural topics relevant to farmers, and contributed to the cultural life of the village. Until his death in 1963, he made his living in Ramot HaShavim from a chicken farm, where he attempted to improve egg production by poultry breeding.[5] After his death in Bad Nauheim, Germany, he was buried in Ramot HaShavim./nHis three sons were born, grew up and studied in Germany before they emigrated to Palestine.[1] He inspired them to study sciences: Ernst Steinitz (1907-1980), was an internist in the private sector; Heinz Steinitz (1909-1971) was a professor of zoology and marine biology in the Department of Zoology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem; and Gideon Steinitz (1911-1975) was a mathematician in his academic education, became a meteorologist in Palestine and eventually was head of the Israel Meteorology Service./nWalter Steinitz was a committed Zionist who developed his unique way of combining scientific pursuit with Zionistic activism.  He participated the Zionist Congresses in Basel in 1903 and in London (1920);[6][7] attended the inauguration ceremony of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1925; chose the coast of Palestine and the eastern Mediterranean Sea as the zoogeographic research area he would study while still being affiliated to the Breslau University;[3][4] and formulated plans for the establishment of a marine research station in Palestine nearly fifteen years prior his decision to move and live in that country.[8] Finally, once he decided to leave Germany, his preference to emigrate to Palestine, and not elsewhere in Europe or America, certainly stemmed from his Zionist convictions./nSteinitz traveled to Palestine for zoological excursions in the second and third decades of the twentieth century. He explored, documented and analyzed his findings of fishes of the Eastern Mediterranean Basin, commenced scientific collections of fishes, and was the first to publish a comprehensive fisheries research of Palestine.[3][4] His investigations were pioneering in two scientific respects: First, he discovered new marine organisms in the region, and second, he found fishes of Indo-Pacific origin along the coast of Palestine.[9] The Suez Canal, a man-made connection between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, was opened only a few decades prior to his investigations in Palestine. The presence of Indo-Pacific species along the Mediterranean coast of Palestine revealed to Steinitz an influx of fishes from the Red Sea - a northern branch of the Indian Ocean - into the east Mediterranean Sea via the Suez Canal waterway, and it suggested that changes had occurred in the marine life of the south east Mediterranean Sea due to human intervention. He argued that with the new situation \u201c\u2026it is the only place on earth where two quite different zoological marine provinces have come into direct touch with one another\u201d and that the Canal \u201c\u2026connects two oceans having each different fauna from the other\u201d. Steinitz was among the first to call for monitoring the impact of the opening of the Suez Canal on the Levant biota.[9] Studies of the invasions of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean Sea, and their ecological consequences for the Mediterranean marine biota, have proliferated since then and are ongoing in the twenty first century.[10][11] The phenomenon of migration of marine species form the Red Sea through the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean Sea is now termed Lessepsian migration./nAs early as 1919 Steinitz published his vision to establish a marine biology research station on the coast of Palestine.[8] He was convinced that a research station located in Palestine would be essential for researching and following changes occurring in the marine biota of the Levant.[12] An exchange of letters on the topic with Prof. Albert Einstein during the period 1919-1937 represent Steinitz\u2019s persistent efforts to raise funds and support for the endeavor.[13] Soon after immigration to Palestine he submitted in 1933 to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem an elaborate proposal for the establishment in Tel Aviv of a biological marine station and aquarium for the study of the Mediterranean marine fauna and as a center for lectures and teaching courses.[14] He received support from the biochemist and Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann, and from Tel Aviv\u2019s mayor Israel Rokach. As a result, the Aquarium and Marine Station Tel Aviv Society Ltd was founded in 1936. Among the group\u2019s founders were the mayor of Tel Aviv, Israel Rokach; Dr. Felix Danziger; Prof. Alfred Klopstock and other scholars. Albert Einstein was Honorary President and Walter Steinitz was the scientific director.[15] The station was supposed to be built on land allocated by the Tel Aviv municipality, on the shore near the Yarkon estuary. The plan included construction of an aquarium, research rooms, a lecture hall and a library, all for the use of local researchers and guests from the international scientific community. The society\u2019s agenda encompassed basic marine biology research of the eastern Mediterranean Sea, research to support fishing as a source of income, and exhibitions of marine animals to the public in the aquarium.[15] The efforts to build the station in Tel Aviv were blocked when World War II broke out. Walter Steinitz made a final, brief and unsuccessful attempt to operate in 1939 a sea laboratory in Nahariya. His dream was ultimately fulfilled three decades later by his son Heinz Steinitz. A marine biology laboratory was inaugurated in 1968 on the coast of the Red Sea, in Eilat, the Gulf of Aqaba, and it is named The Heinz Steinitz Marine Biology Laboratory, in memory of its founder and first director.[16][17] The laboratory became the basic element in the subsequent development of The Interuniversity Institute for Marine Sciences near Eilat./nThe sea anemone Cribrina steinitzi Pax 1925 was named after Walter Steinitz, while the fish species Tylognathus steinitziorum Kosswig (synonym of Hemigrammocapoeta nana Heckel 1843, discovered and named by Dr. Curt Kosswig in 1950), was dedicated to Walter Steinitz and his son Heinz Steinitz.[18]", "545745": "Paul Charles William Davies AM (born 22 April 1946) is an English physicist, writer and broadcaster, a professor in Arizona State University and director of BEYOND: Center for Fundamental Concepts in Science.

Seaton and Sigurd Zienau at University College London.[1][3]  He carried out postdoctoral research under Fred Hoyle in the University of Cambridge./nDavies' research interests are theoretical physics, cosmology and astrobiology; his research has been mainly in the area of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. His notable contributions are the so-called Fulling\u2013Davies\u2013Unruh effect,[4] according to which an observer accelerating through empty space will be subject to a bath of induced thermal radiation, and the Bunch\u2013Davies vacuum state, often used as the basis for explaining the fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation left over from the Big Bang. A paper co-authored with Stephen Fulling and William Unruh was the first to suggest that black holes evaporating via the Hawking effect lose mass as a result of a flux of negative energy streaming into the hole from the surrounding space. Davies has had a longstanding association with the problem of time's arrow, and has also identified the mystery of 'dark energy' as one of the most important issues facing fundamental science.[5] Davies was also an early proponent of the theory that life on Earth may have come from Mars cocooned in rocks ejected by asteroid and comet impacts. He is also a propagator of scientific research and technology development in order to prevent future comet impacts threatening the development or existence of humankind.[6] He proposed that a one-way trip to Mars could be a viable option in the future.

His BBC documentary The Cradle of Life featured the subject of his Faraday Prize lecture. He writes regularly for newspapers and magazines worldwide. He has been guest on numerous radio and television programmes including the children's podcast programme Ask A Biologist./nA 2007 opinion piece \"Taking Science on Faith\" in The New York Times,[12] generated controversy over its exploration of the role of faith in scientific inquiry. Davies argued that the faith scientists have in the immutability of physical laws has origins in Christian theology, and that the claim that science is \"free of faith\" is \"manifestly bogus.\"[12] The Edge Foundation presented a criticism of Davies' article written by Jerry Coyne, Nathan Myhrvold, Lawrence Krauss, Scott Atran, Sean Carroll, Jeremy Bernstein, PZ Myers, Lee Smolin, John Horgan, Alan Sokal and a response by Davies beginning I was dismayed at how many of my detractors completely misunderstood what I had written. Indeed, their responses bore the hallmarks of a superficial knee-jerk reaction to the sight of the words \"science\" and \"faith\" juxtaposed.[13] While atheists Richard Dawkins[14] and Victor J. Stenger[15] have criticised Davies' public stance on science and religion, others, including the John Templeton Foundation, have praised his work.[citation needed]/nDavies wrote an article in The Wall Street Journal describing the background to the December 2010 arsenic bacteria press conference and stating that he supported the finding of Felisa Wolfe-Simon that arsenic can replace phosphorus because \"I had the advantage of being unencumbered by knowledge. I dropped chemistry at the age of 16, and all I knew about arsenic came from Agatha Christie novels.\"[16] He also made the statement, \"Well, I would be astonished if this was the only arsenic-based organism on Earth and Felisa just happened to scrape it up from the bottom of Mono Lake on the first try, It's quite clear that it is the tip of an iceberg. I think it's a window into a whole new world of microbiology. And as a matter of fact, she already has 20 or so candidate other organisms that we're very anxious to take a look at. I think we're going to see a whole new domain of life here.\"[17] It was later independently demonstrated that the organism's DNA contained no arsenic at all.[18][19][20][21] Concerns have been raised about his responsibility as one of Wolfe-Simon's co-authors.[22]", "61526995": "University College London (Ph.D.)/nNicola J.

He says this depends entirely on how genes that are responsible for controlling the plant's growth are activated or deactivated in response to light.[14]/nFolta believes this research would be of interest to farmers wanting to get the most genetic potential out of their crops without the need for chemicals or genetic modification,[14] and he believes his research involving red and far-red light could be used on postharvest fruits to improve their flavor while stored in grocery stores and home refrigerators.[15]/nFolta's work in strawberry genomics began in 2002.[16] Folta was the contributing author in sequencing the strawberry genome in 2011.[16][17] During the project, they discovered molecular markers that speed traditional breeding for enhanced flavors.[16]/nFolta's more recent work with strawberries has involved identifying the compounds responsible for taste that are present in different varieties of the fruit in order to breed these characteristics back into commercial varieties; characteristics which have been lost over time due to strawberries having been bred, traditionally, to select for disease resistance, firmness, size, and yield instead of flavor.[18][19] As a result of this research, his team has identified 30 compounds present in strawberries that affect its flavor, including some that resemble other fruits such as grapes and pineapples, and 6 associated with a human's perception of sweetness.[19][20] These findings can also be used for other staple plants in the rose family such as peaches, almonds, apples, raspberries, and blackberries,[18] and contribute to a growing list of compounds that can be used in the future to produce more flavorful foods without using as much sugar.[20] Folta's research can be used to produce more flavorful and aromatic strawberries using conventional breeding techniques, without the use of genetic modification.[19]/nFolta has formal training in communication and has been recognized for his skill by scholarly institutions.[21] He uses his experience to provide workshops to teach scientists and farmers how to communicate science effectively, and engages with the public through outreach programs, the internet, and other means.[21][22][23]/nNature Biotechnology described Folta as \"a gifted communicator\u2014one of the rare scientists who has engaged the public, with over 12 years experience behind him. Not someone who merely discusses public engagement; but someone who actually communicates directly with non-expert audiences\u2014at science fairs, in schools, at retirement homes, in blogs and podcasts.\"[23]/nIn 2016, Folta was awarded the Borlaug CAST Communication Award by the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology (CAST), named after fellow agricultural biologist and 1970 Nobel Peace Prize winner Norman Borlaug. CAST cited Folta's ability to focus on \"clear, credible information\" and his use of multiple venues to engage the public, in addition to his communication workshops for scientists and farmers. Julie Borlaug, daughter of Norman Borlaug, added, \"[Folta] has not shied away from controversial subjects and has often been the number one target of the anti-science movement on behalf of all of us who support biotechnology.\"[7] Writing about the award in The Des Moines Register, Jack Payne, University of Florida's senior vice president for agriculture and natural resources and leader of the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, praised Folta for his dedication to science communication and willingness to speak to all audiences about food biotechnology. Payne wrote that Folta \"wants to replace fear with fact\" to counteract misinformation about biotechnology and its use in food production.[24]/nFolta has considered his outreach efforts among his proudest achievements, and stated that his most important contributions to science \"won't come out of my lab. They'll come out of my mouth.\"[16]/nWhen you see what it takes to produce a tomato\u2014the number of people involved from breeding all the way to post-harvest, people who pick it, out in the hot sun, really doing really tough work, the huge amounts of fuel and labor that are involved\u2014that I can buy this thing for 50 cents? It amazes me\u00a0...\u00a0It blows me away that we take this for granted./nFolta has been active in the public discussion of politically controversial topics such as evolution, climate change, vaccines, and agricultural biotechnology since 2002.[22][2][26] He views a disconnect between science and the public's understanding, and believes a priority should be given to increase public awareness and \"give scientists the tools to effectively participate at that interface.\"[16] He believes that communication between scientists and the public is increasingly important: \"In 2050, we will look back at this age as a time when our command of biology changed. From being able to manipulate viruses to attack cancer, to precision-change genetic information in a cell, to tweaking a gene and making a crop immune to a disease\u2014breakthroughs like this are real and gaining momentum.\"[27]/nHe has compared the scientific consensus regarding the safety of genetically modified foods to those regarding global warming and vaccines.[28] He is an outspoken critic of food blogger Vani Hari's claims about the alleged dangers of certain food additives that regulators generally recognize as safe.[29] Folta advocates for a \"soft and effective\" approach in handling anti-GMO activists, believing overly inflammatory responses from the scientific community will alienate the public audience.[30] Folta regards the term \"GMO\" as imprecise and not as descriptive as the term \"genetic engineering\".[31] His supportive view is also expressed in an interview at CSICon made by Jonathan Jarry, recalling Kevin Folta's  recent visit to Uganda where he saw Ugandan scientists using genetic engineering to solve a food crisis, although initially being denied the use of this technology.[32]/nAs an example of the importance of public education, Folta says of the changes in crop technology: \"Gene editing is this method of changing a single base (or maybe a few bases) of targeted DNA in an amazingly precise way. And unlike the old methods of genetic engineering that left some of the hardware of the process in the cell, the new methods can yield tiny alterations that solve a problem with a precision change. While scientists celebrate the technology and see it as a way to precision-breed new plants and animals, activists call it the most 'dangerous and insidious form of screwing with nature known to man'.\"[27]/nFolta operates the Talking Biotech podcast which is billed as \"A science-based assessment of new technology and the future of food\",[33] in which he interviews agriculture scientists and experts in the fields of science and communication to discuss the genetic improvement of plants, animals, and microbes and other issues in biotechnology.[34]/nHe has also created the Science Power Hour podcast, which is a parody of an AM talk radio show hosted by Folta's alter ego \"Vern Blazek\". Folta describes the show as an attempt to deliver science communication in an entertaining way that would appeal to a more general audience, and as a way to convey serious topics using humor.[35][36]/nKevin Folta has been a guest on numerous other podcasts such as SHARKFARMER,[37] Talk Nerdy,[38][39] Heartland Daily Podcast,[40] Food and Farm,[41] Science for the People,[42] Vegan Chicago,[43] The Joe Rogan Experience,[44] and The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe.[45][46][47]/nIn February 2015, US Right to Know (USRTK), an Oakland, California-based group whose sole major funder is the Organic Consumers Association,[48] filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the University of Florida as part of a campaign targeting the emails of public scientists who have spoken out in favor of biotechnology.[23][3] USRTK was concerned that scientists such as Folta may have been pressured by food and agricultural companies into claiming that GMOs are safe.[28] The university released documents which indicated that Folta had not committed any scientific misconduct.[2] Folta told Science that he was willing to comply, but was concerned with how USRTK would use the information and how his emails could be taken out of context and used to \"smear\" him.[48]/nIn a Nature article from August 2015 Keith Kloor wrote that Folta had \"close ties to Monsanto and other biotechnology interests\".[2] Folta denied these claims,[49] and wrote that the accusation was based on a few dozen emails, three professional direct interactions over thirteen years, and a reimbursement of customary travel expenses by Monsanto for $719.76, covering airfare, a rental car, 2 hotel nights, and parking for one event to speak to farmers in Colorado in September 2014.[50][51][52] Folta has maintained that he has always communicated information consistently according to his research and understanding as a scientist working for a public institution.[49]/nIn September 2015, Eric Lipton writing for the New York Times reported that the agriculture industry had enlisted academics, including Folta, to use their \"independent voices\" to advocate for public perception and policy, which appeared favorable to the industry.[3] He reported that the University of Florida had received a $25,000 grant from Monsanto to be used at the university's discretion which was earmarked for an established biotechnology communication program. Folta submitted expense reports to use the biotechnology communication fund to pay for travel expenses, a small projector, coffee and food.[50][52] Most of these expenses had since been reimbursed to the fund with honoraria from his talks and private donations from individuals and small businesses, while none of the donation from Monsanto was used.[51][52] In response to the controversy and personal threats against Folta and his family, the university offered to return the donation, which Monsanto refused; instead, funds were redirected to a university food pantry.[2][52][53] Folta has promised a complete accounting for his research and extension activities, which he says \"defines a new standard of transparency and a new tool to cultivate trust\" he hopes other scientists and advocates will adopt.[51]/nIn October 2015, Nature Biotechnology wrote that scientists like Folta have been \"targeted because they speak inconvenient truths about GM technology\" and stated that the funds \"were tied neither to [Folta] directly nor to his research. His conflict of interest disclosures were wholly compliant with his university's rules. He never used industry funds for personal gain.\" The journal criticized the journalists for \"cherry-picking\" and creating \"hostile environments [for scientists] that threaten vibrant rare species with extinction.\"[23]/nMany experts were highly critical of the move by USRTK. Jack Payne, head of the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, characterized this as an example of activist groups attempting to silence scientists who wish to engage in public discussion of politically controversial topics, describing it as a \"spiral of silence\".[53] Gretchen Goldman, writing for the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), a nonprofit science advocacy organization, criticized the FOIA requests for being \"overly wide\", saying it would create \"chilling effects on researchers and confuse the public about the state of the science.\"[28][54][55] Nina Fedoroff, Peter Raven, and Phillip Sharp, three former presidents of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, wrote in The Guardian comparing the USRTK's use of FOIA against scientists to \"Climategate\" and criticized the organization backing them for \"promoting the interests of the organic food business\", calling their activities \"anti-science\".[56] Ralph Nader expressed support for the use of FOIA requests on scientists, calling them \"appropriate subjects\".[57]/nProfessor and science communicator Steven Novella wrote that \"The shill witch hunt is just getting started, and now they are emboldened by the PR bonanza they have found in FOIA requests for e-mails. All of this is likely to have a chilling effect on scientists speaking out in the public square on controversial issues.\"[58]/nIn 2018, Folta sued The New York Times for defamation, following the Times' coverage of Folta's connections to agriculture companies.

The pathway is essential to life, and children born with mutations in genes coding for NER proteins develop xeroderma pigmentosum or XP.  XP patients cannot repair DNA mutations, particularly pyrimidine dimers, caused by UV and must be continuously protected from sunlight to prevent fatal skin scarring and cancers.  By the 1980s, scientists (notably Aziz Sancar) had uncovered how NER works in bacteria but this pathway remained poorly understood in mammalian cells./nWood's first breakthrough came in 1988, after he moved to England to work at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund with Tomas Lindahl (Lindahl, Sancar and Paul Modrich later would receive the 2015 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their contributions to DNA repair).  Working in Lindahl's lab, Wood developed a way to perform NER on DNA in a test tube using crude cell-free extracts from tissues.[13]   By performing this test on extracts derived from blood cells of children with XP, Wood could begin deciphering which different proteins are involved in the NER process.  Extracts from group A XP cells, for example, could be \u201ccomplemented\u201d to resume DNA repair by adding cellular extracts obtained from group C XP patients (who have a normal group A protein but a non-functional group C protein)./nWood established his own group at ICRF and over the next decade, performed a series of biochemistry experiments to understand each step in the repair process by adding individual, purified proteins.[14]  Repair (particularly of UV-induced pyrimidine dimers) includes recognition of the damaged site (probably by sensing an unpaired bubble at the mutation site), nicking the DNA at upstream and downstream sites, excising the damaged DNA, then filling in the single-stranded DNA gap using a polymerase, with the opposite strand serving as a template for the proper sequence for the repair patch.  Since multiple proteins are involved in NER, different XP patients may have different gene mutations (called \"complementation groups\" based on which enzyme is defective in the NER pathway).  Ultimately, his group showed that the entire NER pathway could be performed synthetically by reconstituting 30 different purified proteins, allowing him to define DNA repair at the molecular level.[15] Since returning to the United States, his laboratory has focused on the role polymerases play in making \u2018emergency\u2019 translesion repairs that lead to additional mutational errors and contribute to cancers.[16]/nWood received his B.S. degree in Biology from Westminster College, Salt Lake City Utah (1977), his Ph.D. degree in Biophysics at the University of California, Berkeley (1981), and was a postdoctoral fellow at Yale University from 1982 to 1985.

He continued his research efforts and made various publications on the topic of bee physiology and behavior./nMaximilian Renner was born in Munich on November 4, 1919, and completed his education there. In 1960 he began teaching at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. While there he researched the chronobiology in animals, with a particular focus on honey bees (Apis mellifica). In 1967 he became an adjunct professor (au\u00dferplanm\u00e4\u00dfiger Professor), then retired in 1985 as a Professor (C2). Even after his retirement, he still regularly undertook excursions with students to bring them closer to the beauty of nature./nRenner was married and had two daughters.  He died at the age of 70 on March 20, 1990./nPrevious work by other chronobiologists set the stage for Renner's own research.  His mentor, Karl Von Frisch won a Nobel Prize in 1973 in Physiology or Medicine for his investigations of sensory perceptions in honey bees.[2] This led Renner's peer, Ingeborg Beling, to study time memory in honey bees. The work done by Von Frish and Beling paved the way for Renner's main discovery of time sense in honey bees./nHow is time sense behavior accomplished? Is it through Endogenous or Exogenous mechanisms?/nIn 1955 Max Renner trained bees in Paris by consistently giving them food at the same time every day. He then flew these bees to New York, in a constantly illuminated environment to see if time sense (coming back to the same spot in 24 hour intervals) could happen without constant exogenous factors, i.e. external factors like sunlight or temperature. The experiment examined whether the change in geographic latitude and different time zones impacted what time the bees would come back for food. He found that  bees returned to the same place in roughly 24 hour intervals even in the new location, indicating the presence of an endogenous clock, that is, a regulator intrinsic to the organism independent of the environment.[3]/nThe next experiment looked at whether the exogenous contributions had an effect on the exogenous clock, looking specifically at how it might have impacted how often bees returned to the same spot. The experiment was conducted by training bees in Long Island, New York and then translocating them to Davis California. This was not done in constant light, to ensure that the position sunlight was not regulating the bee's behavior.[4] There were two time periods where the maximum number of bees returned to the spot after arriving in Davis. A large number of bees returned after of 24 hours, but a large number of bees also returned at another time point illustrating an interaction between exogenous and endogenous factors. Max Renner concluded that if the two contributors, internal and external regulators, were in phase they reinforced each other and if they were off phase they competed with one another and impacted behavior./nIs astronomical orientation time compensated?/nMax Renner wanted to examine how animals use the position of the sun to orient themselves. He used the experiment of translocating bees from Long Island to Davis to see how bees changed their orientation angle due to the position of the sun even when it was not consistent with their original time zone. He found that bees oriented themselves to figure out what direction to first fly using the sun-azimuth, which takes in to account the change in sun speed as it changes position throughout the day.[3]/nWith Klaus Schonitzer, another zoologists at the University of Munich, Renner described the antenna cleaning activity of the worker honey bee (Apis mellifica). He discovered they have a structure on their forelegs that they used to clean their antennae with.

He is considered a co-discoverer of the  inheritance of ABO blood types.[1]/nHe was a cousin of Aleksander Rajchman, a Polish mathematician, and of Ludwik Rajchman, a Polish bacteriologist./nHe was born into a Jewish family in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and studied medicine in Germany. In 1902 he entered the University of W\u00fcrzburg and transferred in 1904 to Berlin, where he attended lectures in medicine and philosophy. Hirszfeld completed his doctoral dissertation, \"\u00dcber Blutagglutination,\" in 1907, thus taking the first step in what was to become his specialty. But first he became a junior assistant in cancer research at the Heidelberg Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, where E. von Dungern was his department head. Hirszfeld soon formed a close personal friendship with Dungern which proved to be scientifically fruitful. At Heidelberg they did the first joint work on animal and human blood groups which, in 1900, had been identified as isoagglutinins by Karl Landsteiner.[2][3] Von Dungern and Hirszfeld examined 348 individuals from 72 families and showed that blood groups A and B did not occur in the offspring unless they were present in at least one of the parents, fulfilling the Mendelian principles of inheritance. They also showed that A and B are dominant, while O is a recessive trait. In addition, they came up with the names A, B and O for these blood groups, which have been used since.[4] One year later, they showed that agglutination of A red blood cells can be strong or weak, and proposed two subtypes, named A1 and A2.[5]/nHirszfeld gradually found the working conditions at Heidelberg too confining and to familiarize himself with the entire field of hygiene and microbiology, in 1911 he accepted an assistantship at the Hygiene Institute of the University of Zurich, just after he had married. His wife Hanka (1884\u20131964, born Hanna Kasman), also a physician, became an assistant at the Zurich Children's Clinic under Emil Feer./nIn 1914 Hirszfeld was made an academic lecturer on the basis of his work on anaphylaxis and anaphylatoxin and their relationships to coagulation; he was also named \"Privatdozent.\" When World War I broke out, Serbia was devastated by epidemics of typhus and bacillary dysentery. In 1915 Hirszfeld applied for duty there. He remained with the Serbian army until the end of the war, serving as serological and bacteriological adviser. At this time, in the hospital for contagious diseases in Thessaloniki he discovered the bacillus \"Salmonella paratyphi\" C, today called \"Salmonella hirszfeldi.\"[6]/nAs a physician in the Allied Army of the Orient, together with his wife, he tested over 8000 individuals from at least 16 different ethnic groups, and found that the frequency of blood groups differed depending on the ethnic background; group A was more common among people from Western Europe (English 46% A, 10% B), while B was more common among Asians (Indian 27% A, 47% B). Their report was accepted by The Lancet and published in 1919, and it was the first paper showing that blood group frequencies differ between populations.[7]/nIn 1914, together with R. Klinger, Hirszfeld developed a serodiagnostic reaction test for syphilis, which did not, however, replace the Wasserman test introduced in 1906. His studies of goiter in Swiss endemic regions brought him into sharp disagreement with Eugen Bircher over the theory[whose?]\u2014today widely confirmed\u2014that endemic goitres are caused by iodine deficiency in water and food, in opposition to the hydrotelluric theory./nAfter the end of the war Hirszfeld and his wife returned to Warsaw, where he established a serum institute modeled after the Ehrlich Institute for Experimental Therapy in Frankfurt. He soon became the deputy director and scientific head of the State Hygiene Institute in Warsaw and, in 1924, professor there.[8] He involved in studies how ABO blood group incompatibility between mother and foetus may cause damage to the foetus or newborn.[9] It seems that he was the first to propose that serologic incompatibility between mother and foetus may lead to abortion or fetal or neonatal disease. In 1931 he was named full professor at the University of Warsaw and served on many international boards. After the occupation of Poland by the German Army Hirszfeld was dismissed as a \"non-Aryan\" from the Hygiene Institute but, through the protection of friends, managed to do further scientific work at home until February 1941; it was, however, almost impossible for him to publish./nOn 20 February 1941 Hirszfeld was forced to move into the Warsaw ghetto[8] with his wife and daughter. There he organized anti-epidemic measures and vaccination campaigns against typhus and typhoid, as well as conducting secret medical courses. He was helped there by the parish priest Marceli Godlewski.[10][11] He described the living conditions in the ghetto in his book in The Story of One Life.[12] Between March and June he and his family fled the ghetto and were able to survive underground through using false names and continually changing their hiding place; his daughter died of tuberculosis in the same year.[13]/nWhen a part of Poland was liberated in 1944, Hirszfeld immediately collaborated in the establishment of the University of Lublin and became prorector of the university. In 1945 he became director of the Institute for Medical Microbiology at Wroc\u0142aw and dean of the medical faculty.  He continued his research on blood groups and together with obstetrician prof. Kazimierz Jab\u0142o\u0144ski, introduced exchange transfusion as a treatment for Hemolytic disease of the newborn, which saved the lives of almost 200 children.[14][15] Both Hirszfelds resisted the pressure from the officials and never joined the Communist party. A few months before his death, the Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy in Wroc\u0142aw, now affiliated with the Polish Academy of Sciences and named after him, was created. He became its first director./nHirszfeld received many honors, including honorary doctorates from the universities of Prague (1950) and Zurich (1951).

After further modification, it was named ivermectin (generic) or Mectizan.[11]/nIn 1978, having identified a successful treatment for a type of worms affecting horses, Campbell realised that similar treatments might be useful against related types of worms that affect humans. In 1981, Merck carried out successful Phase 1 treatment trials in Senegal and France on river blindness.[2][12] Taken orally, the drug paralyses and sterilises the parasitic worm that causes the illness.[13] Merck went on to study the treatment of elephantiasis.

This institute has been renamed the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences./nWeber was born in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland in 1936. After earning an undergraduate degree in 1962 and a graduate degree in 1964 from the University of Freiburg, Weber came to the United States to work as a postdoctoral fellow with James D. Watson at Harvard University./nAfter a successful period as a postdoctoral fellow with Watson starting in the spring of 1965, Weber was hired as an assistant professor at Harvard and ran a joint laboratory with Watson and Walter Gilbert. During this period he worked on protein chemistry of RNA phages, but was beginning to shift his focus to animal cells and their viruses, and spent a sabbatical at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory learning the associated techniques. Weber became a Full Professor at Harvard (1972), at the age of 36, 10 years after obtaining an undergraduate degree. His wife was Mary Osborn, who he met when he was a research fellow in the Harvard laboratory. Together they produced the \"Weber and Osborn\" SDS-PAGE paper, which showed that proteins could be dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), reliably separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), visualized by Coomassie brilliant blue staining, and their molecular weights determined with reasonable accuracy. The title of the paper was \"The reliability of molecular weight determinations by dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis\".[2] This technique rapidly became standard lab practice around the world and the original paper became one of the most highly cited in the history of science. An article in the journal Nature identified the 100 most cited papers of all time and listed this paper as number 30, as of October 7, 2014, with 23,642 citations.[3] The pair moved to Germany in 1975 when Weber was offered the position of Director of the Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in G\u00f6ttingen. There they pioneered another new technique: immunofluorescence microscopy. They and Elias Lazarides had previously found that they could tag the subunit proteins of microtubules, microfilaments, intermediate filaments and other cellular structures with specific antibodies and then tag these antibodies with a second fluorescently labelled antibody as described in a series of papers such as \"Actin antibody: the specific visualization of actin filaments in non-muscle cells\".[4] The fluorescent signal could be easily visualized using a fluorescence microscope and this allowed the rapid examination of the localization of molecules in cells and in tissues. This technique has also become a routine part of lab practice all around the world./nHe was a coauthor on a third fundamentally important research report showing that RNA interference could be routinely used to \"knock down\" the expression of major cellular proteins, work he performed with Thomas Tuschl and collaborators. A few weeks work in Weber's lab produced the highly influential paper \"Duplexes of 21-nucleotide RNAs mediate RNA interference in cultured mammalian cells\".[5] This paper set the stage for the widespread use of RNA interference to turn off the expression of normal genes in mammalian systems, a centrally important cell biological technique.

She then attended Mount Carmel College, Bangalore, a women's college offering pre-university courses as an affiliate of Bangalore University.[16]  She studied biology and zoology, graduating from Bangalore University with a bachelor's degree in zoology in 1973.[17][18][19] Mazumdar hoped to go to medical school, but was not able to obtain a scholarship.[20]/nHer father, Rasendra Mazumdar, was the head brewmaster at United Breweries.[21] He suggested that she study fermentation science, and train to be a brewmaster, a very non-traditional field for women.[20] Mazumdar went to Ballarat College, Melbourne University in Australia to study malting and brewing. In 1974, she was the only woman enrolled in the brewing course and topped in her class.[22] She earned the degree as master brewer in 1975.[23][18][22]/nShe worked as a trainee brewer in Carlton and United Breweries, Melbourne and as a trainee maltster at Barrett Brothers and Burston, Australia. She also worked for some time as a technical consultant at Jupiter Breweries Limited, Calcutta and as a technical manager at Standard Maltings Corporation, Baroda between 1975 and 1977.[18][24] However, when she investigated the possibility of advancing her career in Bangalore or Delhi, she was told that she could not be hired as a master brewer in India because \"It's a man's work.\"[25]:\u200a152\u2013153\u200a [26] She began to look abroad for opportunities and was offered a position in Scotland.[25]:\u200a154\u200a[27]:\u200a108/nBefore Mazumdar could move, she met Leslie Auchincloss, the founder of Biocon Biochemicals Limited, of Cork, Ireland. Auchincloss's company produced enzymes for use in the brewing, food-packaging and textile industries.  Auchincloss was looking for a partner in India to help establish an Indian subsidiary to supply him with Papain. Mazumdar agreed to undertake the job on the condition that if she did not wish to continue six months later she would be given a brewmaster's position comparable to the one she was giving up.[27]/nAfter a brief period as a trainee manager at Biocon Biochemicals Limited, of Cork, Ireland, to learn more about the business, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw returned to India.[27] She started Biocon India in 1978 in the garage of her rented house in Bengaluru with a seed capital of Rs. 10,000.[28] Although it was a joint venture, Indian laws restricted foreign ownership to only 30% of the company, which meant that 70% of the company belonged to Kiran Mazumdar Shaw.[29]/nInitially, she faced credibility challenges because of her youth, gender and her untested business model. She was unable to secure funding for her company at the early stages of her business. A chance meeting with a banker at a social event finally enabled her to get her first financial backing.[25][26][27] She also found it difficult to recruit people to work for her start-up, her first employee was a retired garage mechanic [20] and her first unit was in a nearby 3,000-square-foot shed.[25] The most complicated piece of equipment in her lab at that time was a spectrophotometer.[30] Moreover, she faced the technological challenges associated with trying to build a biotech business in a country with poor infrastructure.[25]:\u200a156\u200a[26]:\u200a114\u200a Uninterrupted power, good quality water, sterile labs, imported research equipment, and workers with advanced scientific skills were not easily available in India at that period of time.[31]/nThe company's initial projects were the extraction of papain (an enzyme from papaya used to tenderize meat) and isinglass (obtained from tropical catfish and used to clarify beer).[26] Within a year of its inception, Biocon India was able to manufacture enzymes and export them to the U.S. and Europe, the first Indian company to do so.[25] At the end of her first year, Mazumdar used her earnings to buy a 20-acre property with plans to expand in the future.[20]/nMazumdar spearheaded Biocon's evolution from an industrial enzymes manufacturing company to a fully integrated bio-pharmaceutical company with a well-balanced business portfolio of products and a research focus on diabetes, oncology and auto-immune diseases.[32][33] She also established two subsidiaries: Syngene (1994) which provides early research and development support services on a contract basis and Clinigene (2000) which focuses on clinical research trials and the development of both generic and new medicines. Clinigene was later merged with Syngene. Syngene was listed on BSE/NSE in 2015 and has a current market cap of \u20b923,000 crores.[24][25][26][27][34][35]/nIn 1984, Kiran began to develop a research and development team at Biocon, focusing on the discovery of novel enzymes and on development of novel techniques for solid substrate fermentation technology.[36] The company's first major expansion came in 1987, when Narayanan Vaghul of ICICI Ventures supported creation of a venture capital fund of US$250,000.[27] This money enabled Biocon to expand its research and development efforts. They built a new plant featuring proprietary solid substrate fermentation technology based on a semi-automated tray culture process, inspired by Japanese techniques.[25][27][36] In 1989, Biocon became the first Indian biotech company to receive U.S. funding for proprietary technologies.[25]/nIn 1990, Mazumdar incorporated Biocon Biopharmaceuticals Private Limited (BBLP) to manufacture and market a select range of biotherapeutics in a joint venture with the Cuban Center of Molecular Immunology.[25]/nBiocon Biochemicals of Ireland was acquired from Leslie Auchincloss by Unilever in 1989.[37]:\u200a50\u200a The partnership with Unilever helped Biocon to establish global best practices and quality systems.[30] In 1997, Unilever sold its specialty chemicals division, including Biocon, to Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI).[29] In 1998, Kiran Mazumdar's fianc\u00e9e, Scotsman John Shaw, personally raised $2 million to purchase the outstanding Biocon shares from ICI.[27][38] The couple married in 1998, whereupon she became known as Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw.  John Shaw left his position as chairman at Madura Coats to join Biocon.[39]  He became Biocon's vice chairman in 2001.[20]/nIn 2004, after seeking the advice of Narayana Murthy, Mazumdar-Shaw decided to list Biocon on the stock market.[27] Her intent was to raise capital to further develop Biocon's research programs. Biocon was the first biotechnology company in India to issue an IPO.[25]:\u200a159\u200a Biocon's IPO was oversubscribed 33 times and its first day of trading closed with a market value of $1.11 billion,[25] making Biocon the second Indian company to cross the $1-billion mark on the first day of listing.[40]/nMazumdar-Shaw's belief in \"affordable innovation\" has always been a driving philosophy behind Biocon's expansion. Inspired by the need for affordable drugs in less-wealthy countries, she has looked for opportunities to develop cost-effective techniques and low-cost alternatives.[40][41] She has also proposed that drug companies be cost-sensitive in marketing to developing countries, so that people can afford the drugs they need, particularly chronic therapies.[25][41]/nMazumdar-Shaw noticed the market potential for statins (cholesterol fighting drugs) early on. When the patent of the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin expired in 2001, Biocon got involved in its development. Then the company expanded to other forms of statins. Part of her strategy was to enter into long-term supply contracts, establishing a dependable market base over time. Statins soon accounted for over 50 per cent of the company's revenue. The company's revenue went up from \u20b970 crore in 1998, to \u20b9500 crore in 2004 when it went public.[40]/nBiocon continues to expand into new areas. Yeast expression platforms offer a desirable alternative to mammalian cell cultures for the genetic manipulation of cells for use in a variety of drug treatments. Unicellular methylotrophic yeasts such as Pichia pastoris are used in the production of vaccines, antibody fragments, hormones, cytokines, matrix proteins, and biosimilars.[42]/nBiocon's major areas of research now include cancer, diabetes, and other auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.[27][43] Because of the high percentage of people in India who chew betel or tobacco, India accounts for eighty-six per cent of oral cancer in the world, known locally as \"cancer cheek\".[44][45] Diabetes is prevalent, and people who do not wear shoes are at risk to have a minor scrape or injury develop into gangrene, or \"diabetes foot\".[44][45] Biocon is also working on drugs to treat psoriasis, a skin pigment disease.[44]/nBio-pharmaceuticals developed by the company include Pichia-derived recombinant human insulin and insulin analogs for diabetes, an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody for head and neck cancer, and a biologic for psoriasis.[41] Biocon is Asia's largest insulin producer,[46] and has the largest perfusion-based antibody production facilities.[47]/nAs of 2014, Biocon directed about 10% of its revenue into research and development, a much higher proportion than most Indian pharmacological companies.[48] Biocon has filed at least 950 patent applications based on its research activity.[48] Mazumdar-Shaw has remained actively engaged in acquisitions, partnerships and in-licensing in the pharmaceuticals and bio-pharmaceutical areas, entering into more than 2,200 high-value R&D licensing and other deals between 2005 and 2010.[40]/nIn 2004, Mazumdar-Shaw started a corporate social responsibility wing at Biocon, the Biocon Foundation. The Foundation focuses on health, education and infrastructure, especially in rural areas of Karnataka which lack healthcare facilities.[40]/nMazumdar-Shaw dislikes the term \"philanthropy\", believing that it often provides temporary fixes rather than addressing the root cause or the underlying situation.[44] She prefers the term \"compassionate capitalist\", believing that properly applied business models can provide an ongoing foundation for sustainable social progress. Mazumdar once said, \"Innovation and commerce are as powerful tools for creating social progress as they are for driving technological advancement. When they are put to use for social progress, the implementation is a lot cheaper, a lot more people benefit, and the effect is more lasting.\"[49]  In 2015, she joined The Giving Pledge, promising that at least half of her wealth will be dedicated to philanthropy.[50]/nRural areas in India are estimated to have only one doctor for every two thousand people, it is estimated that 70 million people do not have the money to pay for a doctor's visit or for medicine.[51] The Biocon Foundation is involved in numerous health and education outreach programs to benefit the economically weaker sections of Indian society.[40]/nWith Devi Shetty of Narayana Hrudayalaya Hospital, Mazumdar-Shaw has supported the development of Arogya Raksha Yojana (Health Protection Program/Health Help).[26] Through this program Biocon Foundation establishes clinics to offer clinical care, generic medicines and basic tests for those who cannot afford them.[49][52] As of 2010, seven clinics each served a population of 50,000 patients living within a radius of 10\u00a0km, treating in total more than 3,00,000 people per year.[24] Clinics organize regular general health checks in remote villages by bringing in physicians and doctors from network hospitals. To improve early detection of cancer, they have trained young women as community health workers, using smartphones to send photographs of suspicious lesions to oncologists at the cancer center.[45][53] Public health campaigns such as \"Queen of Heart\" educate people about specific health issues and promote early detection of problems such as cardiovascular diseases.[54]/nThe clinics operate based on a model of micro-financed health insurance.[26] Biocon provides low-cost drugs, making a negligible profit on a unit basis, but an overall profit on volume due to the participation of large numbers of people.[51] Clinics also use a \"subsidised convenience\" pricing plan, under which more wealthy patrons pay full price in return for the convenience of scheduling their visits and procedures at desirable times, while poorer patients can obtain cheap or even free services by choosing less desirable times.[49] Doctors and researchers look for opportunities to use cutting-edge technology in ways that will drive down costs and ensure quality of service.[51]/nThe death of her best friend, Nilima Rovshen, and the illnesses of her husband and her mother with cancer, have motivated Mazumdar-Shaw to support cancer research and treatment.[1] In 2009, she established a 1,400-bed cancer care center, the Mazumdar-Shaw Medical Foundation, at the Narayana Health City campus in Bangalore, collaborating with Devi Shetty of Narayana Hrudayalaya.[55]  In 2011, she added a center for advanced therapeutics with a bone marrow transplant unit and a research center.[56]  Her goal is to create a world-class cancer center.[44][45]/nMazumdar Shaw Medical Foundation is a non-profit organization and has two arms to support its cause, which are Mazumdar Shaw Center for Translational Research and Mazumdar Shaw Cancer outreach program./nIn collaboration with McMillan India Limited and teacher Prathima Rao, Mazumdar-Shaw has supported development and use of a basic mathematics textbook, introduced in Kannada schools in 2006.[27]:\u200a117\u200a[57]/nShe funded a multi-year research program by creating the Biocon Cell for Innovation Management with Prasad kaipa at the Indian School of Business in 2009.[58][59]/nMazumdar-Shaw speaks about the importance of improving India's infrastructure,[26]:\u200a112\u200a[60] emphasizing the need to address issues such as efficient governance, job creation, and food, water, and health insecurity.[61]/nBiocon, Infosys and other companies have had a significant impact on Bengaluru. These companies attract many scientists who would otherwise go overseas. Once a \"pensioner's paradise\", Bangalore is now called \"the best urban working environment in India\".[62]  Biocon Park, built in 2005, is a ninety-acre campus with five thousand employees. Outside the developed city, however, infrastructure is still poor.[44]/nMazumdar-Shaw is a proponent of good government and infrastructure. She supported the Bangalore Agenda Task Force, an initiative of S. M. Krishna and Nandan Nilekani to improve the city's infrastructure and standard of living.[62][63] Mazumdar-Shaw is part of the Bangalore City Connect Foundation, a non-profit trust for discussion of civic issues, involving both urban stakeholders and the government. Mazumdar-Shaw is actively engaged in urban reform, partnering with Jana Urban Space Foundation and local government to improve roads.[63] She is also involved in the Bangalore Political Action Committee (B.PAC), which reviews and recommends candidates running in elections.[64][65]/nAfter the 2009 flood, Biocon, Infosys and Wipro all committed to rebuilding homes for flood victims in north Karnataka. Biocon committed to building 3,000 houses at a cost of Rs 30 crore.[66][67]/nMazumdar-Shaw is a member of the board of governors of the Indian School of Business,[68] a term member on the board of MIT, USA till 2023, and a past member of the board of governors of the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad.[69]/nAs of February 2014, Mazumdar-Shaw became the first woman to head the board of governors of the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore (IIMB).[70][71][72]/nShe is an independent director on the board of Infosys.[73] She is also a member of the General Body of Maharashtra State Innovation Society.

He is famous for starting as an ardent believer in natural selection and later becoming one of its fiercest critics. Mivart attempted to reconcile the theory of evolution as propounded by Charles Darwin with the beliefs of the Catholic Church but was condemned by both Darwin and the Church.[1] His belief in a soul created by God and insistence that evolutionism was not incompatible with the existence of such a God brought him into conflict with other evolutionists, while his theological theories on hell and on the compatibility between science and Catholicism led him to clash with the Church.[2]/nMivart was born in London. His parents were Evangelicals, and his father was the wealthy owner of Mivart's Hotel (now Claridge's). His education started at the Clapham Grammar School, and continued at Harrow School and King's College London. Following his conversion to Catholicism, he was instructed at St.\u00a0Mary's, Oscott (1844\u20131846), and was confirmed there on 11\u00a0May 1845. His conversion automatically excluded him from the University of Oxford, then open only to members of the Anglican faith. His mother followed him into the Catholic Church in 1846.[3]/nIn 1851 he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn, but he devoted himself to medical and biological studies. In 1862 he was appointed to the chair in zoology at St.\u00a0Mary's Hospital medical school. In 1869 he became a fellow of the Zoological Society of London, and in 1874 he was appointed by Mgr Capel as Professor of Biology at the short-lived Catholic University College, Kensington, a post he held until 1877.[4][5]/nHe was vice-president of the Zoological Society twice (1869 and 1882); Fellow of the Linnean Society from 1862, secretary from 1874 to 1880, and vice-president in 1892. In 1867 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society for his work \"On the Appendicular skeleton of the Primates\". This work was communicated to the society by Thomas Henry Huxley. Mivart was a member of the Metaphysical Society from 1874. He received the degrees of Doctor of Philosophy from Pope Pius IX in 1876, and of Doctor of Medicine from the University of Louvain in 1884.[6]/nMivart met Huxley in 1859, and was initially a close follower and a believer in natural selection. \"Even as a professor he continued to attending Huxley's lectures ... they became close friends, dining together and arranging family visits.\"[1] However, Huxley was always strongly anti-Catholic, and no doubt this attitude led to Mivart becoming disenchanted with him. Once disenchanted, he lost little time in reversing on the subject of natural selection. In short, he now believed that a higher teleology was compatible with evolution./nAs to \"natural selection\", I accepted it completely and in fact my doubts & difficulties were first excited by attending Prof. Huxley's lectures at the School of Mines.[1]/nEven before Mivart's publication of On the Genesis of Species in 1871, he had published his new ideas in various periodicals.[7] Huxley,[8] Lankester, and Flower had come out against his ideas, although O'Leary (2007) reports that \"their initial reaction to Genesis of Species was tolerant and impersonal\".[9]/nThough admitting evolution in general, Mivart denied its applicability to the human intellect (a view also taken by Wallace). His views as to the relationship between human nature and intellect and animal nature in general were given in his books Nature and Thought[10] and Origin of Human Reason.[11][5]/nMivart was someone Darwin took seriously; Darwin prepared a point-by-point refutation which appeared in the sixth edition of Origin of Species. One of Mivart's criticisms to which Darwin responded was a perceived failure of natural selection to explain the incipient stages of useful structures. Taking the eye as an example, Darwin was able to show many stages of light sensitivity and eye development in the animal kingdom as proof of the utility of less-than-perfect sight (argument by intermediate stages). Another was the supposed inability of natural selection to explain cases of parallel evolution, to which Huxley responded that the effect of natural selection in places with the same environment would tend to be similar./nMivart's hostile review of the Descent of Man in the Quarterly Review aroused fury from his former intimates, including Darwin himself, who described it as \"grossly unfair\". Mivart had quoted Darwin by shortening sentences and omitting words, causing Darwin to write: \"Though he means to be honourable, he is so bigoted that he cannot act fairly.\"[12] Relationships between the two men were near breaking point. In response, Darwin arranged for the reprinting of a pamphlet by Chauncey Wright, previously issued in the US, which severely criticised Genesis of Species. Wright had, under Darwin's guidance, clarified what was, and was not, \"Darwinism\".[12]:\u200a353\u2013356/nThe quarrel reached a climax when Mivart lost his usual composure over what should have been a minor incident: In 1873, George Darwin (Charles' son) published a short article in The Contemporary Review suggesting that divorce should be made easier in cases of cruelty, abuse, or mental disorder. Mivart reacted with horror, using phrases like \"hideous sexual criminality\" and \"unrestrained licentiousness\".

The only animal that can hurt you with its tongue is a human.\u201d[4]/nWiley argued that even venomous snakes were harmless if properly trained.[4]  She boasted that she had tamed over 300 venomous snakes in her lifetime,[2] and she routinely handled rattlesnakes, cobras, copperheads, and mambas with her bare hands, eschewing any special instruments like hooks or snake tongs.[6]  She also left snakes' cages open for long periods of time and permitted venomous species to crawl throughout her workspace.[4]/nThough Wiley did not receive any serious snakebites during her time at the Minneapolis Library,[2] her habits gradually brought her into conflict with many of her colleagues, who feared for Wiley's and their own safety.[4]  After a series of disputes, Wiley was finally pressured to leave the Minneapolis Library in 1933.  Wiley quickly found new work as a curator of reptiles at the Brookfield Zoo, which opened in the western suburbs of Chicago in 1934, and she brought the library's collection of 236 reptiles and amphibians with her.[4][7]  Unfortunately, her casual snake-handling methods did not endear her to zoo staff members there, either, and after she had allowed 19 snakes to escape from their cages in 1935, she was fired by zoo director Robert Bean.[8]/nAfter parting ways with Brookfield Zoo, Wiley moved to California, where she became a snake trainer and reptile consultant for Hollywood films such as Moon Over Burma, The Jungle Book, and the Tarzan series.[9]  She also operated a reptile zoo in Cypress, California, where she charged 25 cents for visitors to see her large, personal collection.[5]/nOn July 20, 1948, Wiley invited journalist Daniel P.

He was a life-long member of the American Society for Microbiology and was honored by being appointed their 1967 ONR lecturer, and by receiving the 1978 Fisher Award in Applied and  Environmental Microbiology./nHis first encounter with aquatic microbiology and with an acute applied problem, came when he started to study the reasons for a 1947 severe outbreak of fish death in artificial fish ponds in Israel. He showed that growth of a toxic unicellular phytoflagellate\u2014Prymnesium parvum and the synthesis of their toxins have different optimal requirements. The toxin turned out to be a proteo-lipid containing 15 amino acids, fatty acid and phosphates. This is one of the first toxins to be isolated in Algea and its toxic effects studied (Shilo 1967). The combination of basic research on the regulation and action of the Prymnesium toxins, together with the development of field tests and the appropriate treatment of fishponds by ammonia and copper, eliminated this problem in aquaculture in Israel./nAnother set of landmark studies was initiated at the Solar Lake on the edge of the Red Sea, a small unique hypersaline body of water 20 km south of Eilat. The Solar Lake was established as a model for microbial interactions in extreme environments. The major studies included the discovery of anoxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria as a major evolutionary stage in the evolution of photosynthesis, and the diurnal shift between oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis (Cohen et al. 1975). In addition, the studies revealed a Microbial mat\u2014these stratified benthic microbial communities, dominated by cyanobacteria, develop over the bottom of the Solar Lake. Such microbial mats are modern analogs to stromatolites: Precambrian laminated sedimentary rocks, which are the oldest known microfossils (dated to be 3.5 billion years old)./nDuring the last decade of his life, Shilo\u2019s work focused on benthic cyanobacteria. Production of a hydrophobic external surface allows these organisms to adhere to submerged surfaces. Spreading through a planktonic phase occurs by formation of special cells that have a hydrophilic surface and detach from the mother cells, or transient secretion of substances that mask the hydrophobic surface (Fatum & Shilo 1984). These studies have pioneered the current trend in microbiology that focuses on mixed bacterial communities and the dynamic formation and dissociation of biofilms./nShilo's contributions to science in Israel included some significant contributions to Israel's scientific infrastructure. His major contribution in this field was the establishment of the Department of Microbial Molecular Ecology\u2014in the Faculty of Science at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the base of his research and teaching. He was pro-rector of the Hebrew University in the 70s. He also founded, in 1949, the laboratory for the study of fish disease in Kibutz Nir David, in close collaboration with his lifelong friend and colleague Shmuel Sarig. In 1964 he chaired a national committee recommending the establishment of a Marine Research Laboratory in Eilat, Israel.

When World War II began, Michael and his mother and brother lived in the village of East Harptree which was relatively safer from the threat of German bombs. Returning to Bedminster, Michael attended Colston's School as his father and grandfather had, although the family's financial circumstances required him to qualify for a scholarship to attend Colston's. Whilst attending a Christian student conference in 1951, he met his future wife, Maureen Room, with whom he corresponded while attending university and whom he married in 1955.[1]/nWhilst attending Colston's School, Pitman had achieved high marks in science subjects, particularly in botany, on which he decided to focus at university. He won two scholarships to attend Sidney Sussex College at the University of Cambridge, and he started his studies there in 1952. Graduating with a first class degree, another scholarship from the Agricultural Research Council enabled him to complete a PhD in botany in 1959. He continued to work at Cambridge in teaching and post-doctoral research, and was appointed a Junior Fellow of St John's College.[1]/nIn 1962, Pitman was offered a job as a lecturer at the University of Adelaide in South Australia, which he accepted, intending to return to England eventually. However, his family found the lifestyle in Australia very enjoyable, and when Pitman was offered the position of Professor of Biology (Plant Physiology) at the University of Sydney in 1966, he and his family decided to remain in Australia permanently.[1]/nIn 1983, Pitman retired from the University of Sydney, and was appointed as the Director of the Institute of Biological Resources, one of the divisions of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia's peak scientific body.

After moving from Harvard Medical School in 1960, Magasanik spent the rest of his research career at MIT, including an influential decade as the head of the Department of Biology from 1967\u201377. Magasanik's research interests focused on gene regulation, including study of nitrogen metabolic regulation in bacteria, catabolite repression, and intracellular signaling via two-component systems. Magasanik retired in 1990 and died in 2013.[1][2]/nMagasanik was born in Kharkiv, Ukraine on December 19, 1919, to a family he later described as \"belonging to the capitalist class\" and who left for Vienna after Kharkiv was captured by Communist forces during the then-ongoing Ukrainian civil war. Raised in Vienna, Magasanik began his university education studying chemistry in 1937, but was unable to continue due to the Anschluss in 1938, in which Jews were expelled from Austrian universities. He then emigrated to New York City, where his sister and her husband had moved a year prior, and there completed his studies at the City College of New York, from which he graduated in 1941.[2][3]/nMagasanik began graduate education at Pennsylvania State University, but was interrupted by the United States' entry into World War II. As Magasanik later recalled, other recent chemistry graduates of the period were able to find jobs in the defense industry, but as he was not yet eligible for American citizenship, he was instead drafted into the army and ultimately spent four years serving as a medical technician.[2]/nAfter leaving the army Magasanik returned to Ph.D. studies, this time at Columbia University under the direction of Erwin Chargaff. Magasanik received his Ph.D. in 1948. Asked years later to write a brief autobiography about his life in science, Magasanik described his early life as \"almost entirely determined by the political events of the period between the two world wars and by World War II.\"[2]/nMagasanik was recruited to a position at Harvard Medical School by J. Howard Mueller and began his faculty career there in 1949, advancing to a tenured position in the Department of Bacteriology and Immunology in 1958. During this period he spent a sabbatical at the Pasteur Institute with Jacques Monod thanks to a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1960, Magasanik was recruited from Harvard to MIT by noted microbiologist Salvador Luria, who sought to raise the MIT Department of Biology's profile in molecular biology.[1][3][2]/nIn 1967, Magasanik became the head of the Department of Biology, a position in which he served until 1977. His leadership during this period, especially in decision-making about new faculty hires, has been widely cited as contributing to the success of the department in the molecular biology field.[1][3]/nMagasanik became the Jacques Monod Professor of Biology in 1977.[4][5]\nAfter being succeeded by Gene Brown as department head, Magasanik concentrated on research and teaching rather than administrative work until his retirement in 1990, when he became professor emeritus.[2]/nIn 1969, Magasanik became a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, from which he received the Selman A.

The phytochrome tells plants when to germinate and when not to germinate, as well as identifying where plants should grow to absorb the most light possible.[5] She derived the phytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans, a species of bacterium that was known to be tolerant to ionising radiation.[5] The phytochrome was isolated, crystallized and investigated using x-ray crystallography.[5] Forest identified that the protein had a knot, which she predicts may serve to stabilize the protein so that it can capture sunlight.[5] In the absence of such a structure, Forest believes that the phytochrome would undergo a conformational change under illumination, and wouldn't be able to effectively capture the sunlight.[5] Such structures can store the light they absorb for several days, which allows the plant to predict where the light may come from each day.[5] Forest went on to study the light-harvesting mechanisms of actinobacteria, identifying two light-capturing molecular components that absorb light at different energies.[6]/nRecognizing the impact of protein molecular structure on biological function, Forest turned to the design of novel proteins with tuneable properties.[7] Amongst these, she identified a stable synthetic collagen that may offer hope for conditions such as arthritis.[8] The modified protein contains less flexible amino acids to the original form, which stiffens the structure and helps the protein to maintain structural integrity even when exposed to elevated temperatures.[9][10]/nForest worked with Laura L.

In The Lancet, and other periodicals edited by Farr and Thomas Wakley, he wrote polemically, in particular against the officials John Rickman and John Finlaison.[7]/nTwo committees of the Statistical Society involved Edmonds. In 1838 he was the leader of a group of six fellows asking for a committee to work on vital statistics. The plan was to circulate insurance offices with a request for information. The matter was taken up by Benjamin Gompertz in correspondence with Charles Babbage. In the end an external group of actuaries was consulted.[10] In 1841 Farr pressed for a committee to collect vital statistics from patients at London hospitals. A distinguished group came together, and two reports were produced.[11][12]/nIn 1852 Edmonds gave evidence to a House of Commons committee on income and property tax.[13] The following year he gave evidence to a committee chaired by James Wilson, on the Legal and General's business practices, and assurance associations in general.[14]/nEdmonds is considered a Ricardian socialist,[15] though this is disputed by Thompson,[16] and an Owenite.[17] He has also been called a \"co-operative socialist\".[18] He anticipated Karl Marx in a theory of surplus labour and wages, and in postulating the replacement of capitalism by a later stage, which he called the \"social system\".[19]/nEdmonds wrote three books in the period 1828 to 1832./nThis work is considered, by J. W. Burrow, to contain evolutionary ideas, Lamarckian and in the style of Erasmus Darwin, and to anticipate Herbert Spencer in introducing such ideas into social thought.[20] On the other hand, Edmonds was a polygenist believing in immutable human species, and no social Darwinist. His analysis of pauperism was inconsistent, but he could attribute it to the effects of private property.[21] F. J. C. Hearnshaw considered that the book foreshadowed Walter Bagehot's Physics and Politics.[22]/nIn Life Tables, founded upon the discovery of a numerical law regulating the existence of every human being (1832),[23] Edmonds claimed as a new discovery on the mortality rate a model on ageing and mortality found in the 1820s by Benjamin Gompertz. He promoted its application to case fatality risk, to medical professionals.[24] He also remarked on many other related topics, such as maximum birth rates and gender mortality differentials.[25]/nIn his mortality theory, Edmonds took up observations of Richard Price, dividing life into three periods (childhood, \"manhood\" from age 12 to 55, and old age). He quantified mortality by using different geometric progressions in each period.[26] His table became known as \"Edmonds's Mean Mortality\".[27] He persisted into the 1860s with his piecewise approach, though by then with two periods, rather than the sigmoid curve model of Gompertz.[28] But Edmonds came in for some rough handling for his continuing assertions of the independence of his model from that of Gompertz. Augustus De Morgan and Thomas Bond Sprague took him to task during the early 1860s, in the Journal of the Institute of Actuaries.[29] This controversy was later thought to have slowed acceptance of the refinement proposed by William Makeham to the Gompertz model, now the Gompertz\u2013Makeham law of mortality.[30]/nAn Enquiry into the Principles of Population, Exhibiting a System of Regulations for the Poor (1832)[31] was anonymous at its publication.[32] Garrett Hardin regarded this book as the first important population theory opposed to that of Robert Malthus.[33] It contains an analysis of famine, as caused by export of food, with remarks on the Irish situation.[18]/nIn arguing against Malthus, Edmonds (in common with Richard Jones, Augustus Henry Moreton and George Rickards) laid weight on factors that could cause postponement of marriage.[34] In general he relied on \"non-moral\" effects, and Chapter VIII of the book addressed the possible effects on labourers' fertility of upward mobility.[35] Edmonds attributed some contemporary social problems to the small extent of the middle class.[36] He rejected \"Sadler's law\" put forth by Michael Thomas Sadler two years earlier, to the effect that higher population density led to lower fertility, on the basis of empirical work in some urban areas. Later research by David Heron confirmed Edmonds's findings, which left open the question of urban versus rural fertility.[37]/nEdmonds married Elizabeth Elspith Ruddack in 1833.

Wallace Professor of Genetics.  He is also affiliated with the Yale Cancer Center and the Yale Stem Cell Center./nGiraldez specializes in understanding how a newly fertilized egg transforms into a highly-functioning, complex animal. This is a critical period in embryonic development and many of the pathways and molecules that drive this transformation are shared across animal species. Giraldez uses zebrafish as a model system, because it can be easily manipulated and visualized, and because the genetic tools to unlock its secrets are very sophisticated. When an egg is fertilized, it must shut down the maternal signals that maintain its identity and activate a new program to become a healthy zygote, which in turn can develop into a fully-fledged adult. Giraldez has contributed to characterizing the shift that occurs after the embryo interprets and shuts down the maternal program and activates the developmental program contained in its own genome./nGiraldez's work has wide implications for understanding developmental genetics in humans and other species, advancing RNA biology, and exploring the activation of embryonic cells in health and disease.  He has been named a Howard Hughes Faculty Scholar[1] and a Pew Scholar in Biomedical Sciences.  In addition, he has received the Blavatnik Award for Young Scientists (National Finalist), the Vilcek Prize for Creative Promise in Biomedical Science and the John Kendrew Young Scientist Award from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL).[2]/nBorn in 1975 in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain, Giraldez attended high school at La Salle Buen Pastor, in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain. He followed on with studies in Chemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Cadiz and the University Autonoma of Madrid. As an undergraduate, he worked with Gin\u00e9s Morata at the Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBMSO) in Madrid. Giraldez completed his PhD with Stephen Cohen at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL, Heidelberg, 1998\u20132002), followed by postdoctoral studies with Alexander Schier at the Skirball Institute (NYU) and Harvard (2003\u20132006)./nHe established his laboratory at Yale in 2007, became director of graduate studies in 2012, and left that position to become chair the genetics department in 2017, where he is now the Fergus F. Wallace Professor of Genetics./nGiraldez began his career at the Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBMSO) in Madrid, working on the development of Drosophila under the mentorship of Gin\u00e9s Morata. He then moved to the EMBL to study the mechanisms of development of the Drosophila wing under the mentorship of Stephen Cohen. Giraldez identified the gene Notum, so called because it caused duplication of the notum region upon overexpression in the wing primordium.[3] He discovered that Notum encodes a secreted inhibitor that reduces the local concentration of an important developmental signaling molecule known as Wingless./nDuring his postdoctoral career at the Skirball Institute (NYU) and Harvard with Alexander Schier, Giraldez investigated the role of microRNAs and the microRNA processing machinery Dicer in vertebrate embryonic development. Giraldez's studies of mRNA and embryonic microRNAs led to fundamental insights into the mechanisms by which a maternal cell transitions to a self-regulating zygote, a process known as the maternal to zygotic transition (MZT). During MZT, zygotic genome activation regulates maternal mRNAs, but the molecular effectors of this regulation were a mystery. Giraldez and collaborators identified a conserved microRNA, miR-430 which represses, deadenylates, and clears \u224820% of maternal mRNAs2. MiR-430 is a large microRNA family that is conserved in other vertebrates: miR-427 in Xenopus and miR-290-295/302 in mouse and humans. This work, which was reported in the journal Science in 2005 and 2006, revealed the importance of miRNAs generally in different aspects of embryonic development and revealed a novel mechanism of miRNA-mediated regulation known as deadenylation.[4][5] In 2012, Giraldez led a study showing how miR-430 reduces translation before causing mRNA decay, which was again published in Science.[6] Giraldez's work on miR-430 has opened a new area of research in the field of developmental genetics./nWhen Giraldez established his laboratory at Yale he continued to investigate the regulatory code that shapes embryonic development, using zebrafish as a model. In the early days of his laboratory he discovered a new mechanism of microRNA processing independent of Dicer that requires the catalytic activity of Argonaute 2, a type of Argonaute protein.[7] This pathway is required to process miR-451 in vertebrates to regulate development and cellular responses to stress during hematopoiesis.[7][8] His work also defined hundreds of targets for different microRNAs during embryonic development, demonstrating that microRNAs can shape gene expression patterns in space and time[9][10]/nThe Giraldez laboratory has applied genomic approaches to understand translation regulation during development. Using ribosome footprinting, the lab has identified novel, translated genes that encode micropeptides, one of which regulates cell motility in embryogenesis as shown by the Alexander Schier[11][12] and Bruno Reversade[13] laboratories. Through further analysis of translation, Giraldez's work uncovered an important role for codon composition and translation in regulating mRNA stability during the maternal-to-zygotic transition across different species.[14] This regulatory layer must be conserved, based on its previous discovery in yeast by the Jeff Coller laboratory.[15] Giraldez's work established the concept that mRNAs can have differential stability dependent on the codon composition and tRNA availability[16][17] and showed the importance of regulating mRNA levels during cellular transitions and homeostasis./nFurther work in the Giraldez laboratory has explored the mechanisms of zygotic genome activation after fertilization.[18] His lab identified a set of transcription factors that enabled activation of miR-430 and a large fraction of the genome after fertilization: maternal Nanog, Oct4 and SoxB1.[19] Some of these factors are involved in stem cell maintenance and cellular reprogramming.[20] These findings offer a new understanding of how the genome becomes activated, linking cellular and developmental reprogramming./nGiraldez's current work involves deciphering the post-transcriptional regulatory code during development and the regulation of cellular differentiation in the zygote. In 2018, Giraldez delivered a Keynote Lecture as part of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory's Leading Strand Series, which can be viewed online here./nGiraldez has served on several major review committees.

Bhabha's invitation to join the project team set up by the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, (TIFR) Mumbai for the development of the first indigenous computer.[2] Five years later, the prototype of the computer was ready and the computer was inaugurated by the then prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, who named the equipment as Tata Institute of Fundamental Research Automatic Calculator (TIFRAC).[1] In 1961, he went back to Illinois, US to conduct further research on cognitive science at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign and worked as a visiting scientist at the Digital Computer Laboratory of the university till 1964.[5][8] His next assignment at TIFR was the establishment of a software development centre and that is reported to have paved way for the founding of the National Center for Software Development and Computing Techniques (NCSDCT) under TIFR.[1] The institution was later renamed as the National Centre for Software Technology and was merged into the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) in 2003.[2][9]/nIn August 1963, the Government of India set up an interdepartmental Electronics Committee under the chairmanship of Vikram Sarabhai for finding ways for self-sufficiency in the electronics industry sector[10] and Narasimhan was made the chairman of one of the sub committees, entrusted with the responsibility to look into the possibilities of finding ways to reduce dependence on IBM and International Computers Limited.[5] One of the recommendations of Narasimhan Committee was to establish a national organization for manufacture and maintenance of computers which was later endorsed by the Electronics Commission, headed by M. G. K. Menon,[11] and Narasimhan was entrusted with the responsibility which resulted in the formation of Computer Maintenance Corporation, later day CMC Limited as a fully owned government company in 1977 with Narasimhan as its founder chairman.[1][5] He was also connected with TIFR at their National Centre for Software Development Computing Techniques from 1975 to 1985.[8]/nNarasimhan was associated with several agencies and organizations for his research; the Industrial Design Centre at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, the Speech Pathology Unit of Topiwala National Medical College and Nair Hospital, the All India Institute of Speech and Hearing, the Central Institute of Indian Languages, the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, and the Centre for Applied Cognitive Science at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education,[8] Toronto were some of them.[5] He sat on the council of the International Federation for Information Processing as the representative of India during 1975-86 and was a member of the Scientific Advisory Council of the Indo-French Centre for the Promotion of Advanced Research from 1988 to 1990.[8] He retired from TIFR service in 1990 as a professor of eminence but retained his association with CMC past his retirement in the capacity as an advisor even after the company was bought by Tata Consultancy Services in 2001.[1] He died on 3 September 2007, at the age of 81, in Bengaluru in Karnataka.[2][8]/nBesides the contributions in the development of the first Indian computer and founding of CMC and the National Center for Software Development and Computing Techniques, Narasimhan was involved in bringing the computer sector in India together and was successful in founding a society, the Computer Society of India in 1964 and became its founder president, a post he held till 1969.[1] He was involved in research in the area of the theory of behaviour,[2][8] extending his studies to first language acquisition, artificial intelligence, computational modelling of behaviour and modelling language behaviour, and was reported to be the first to discover an analogy between \u2033formal grammars of natural languages and the formal structures underlying picture processing\u2033.[1] He carried on his research on synthetic pattern recognition during his stint at the University of Illinois from 1961 to 1964 into TIFR and \u2033developed a meta theory and approach to the study of language behaviour\u2033.[1] His argument was that the use of behaviour to specific uses must have been evolutionary and as such, use must define the structure or mechanism. This was the topic of his book, Modeling Language Behaviour,[12] which is considered to have offered alternatives to the concepts of Noam Chomsky,[1] drawing comparisons with the American cognitive scientist.[2]/nNarasimhan studied the environment a child (9 months to 3 years) is exposed to while he or she acquired their first language. This ethological study of language behaviour acquisition led him to the discovery that the pre-literate oral language behaviour differed from the literate language behaviour and while the former is genetic, the latter is acquired.[1] He postulated that this difference was analogous to connectionist Artificial Intelligence that included non literate modes of functioning and rule-based Artificial Intelligence. His book, Artificial Intelligence and the Study of Agentive Behaviour, released in 2004, details his findings.[13] The book is reported to have propounded a new understanding of early education of children.[1]/nNarasimhan's studies in the 1960s and 70s at Illinois on computational modeling of visual behaviour is known to have proposed a new grammar for analysing the visually given image. In order to have a better understanding, his team at Illinois developed a new language by name, PAX, and the group worked on developing a hardware working on PAX to analyse the retinal image but the project was abandoned after a while.[1] Besides several articles written in peer reviewed journals,[5] he published two more books, between the release of Modeling Language Behaviour and Artificial Intelligence and the Study of Agentive Behaviour, released in 1998 and 2004 respectively.

They are all experiencing the consequences of misfolded proteins. ... In humans the consequences can be deadly, leading to such devastating illnesses as Alzheimer's Disease. In one case, the misfolded protein is not only deadly to the unfortunate individual in which it has appeared, but it can apparently be passed from one individual to another under special circumstances \u2013 producing infectious neurodegenerative diseases such as mad-cow disease in cattle and Creutzfeldt\u2013Jacob Disease in humans.[27]/nLindquist worked on the PSI+ element in yeast (a prion) and how it can act as a switch that hides or reveals numerous mutations throughout the genome, thus acting as an evolutionary capacitor. She proposed that a heat shock protein, hsp90, may act in the same way, normally preventing phenotypic consequences of genetic changes, but showing all changes at once when the HSP system is overloaded, either pharmacologically or under stressful environmental conditions.[28]/nMost of these variations are likely to be harmful, but a few unusual combinations may produce valuable new traits, spurring the pace of evolution.

Ahmed's group has developed a widely used multilocus sequence typing scheme for species level identification of pathogenic Leptospira with a potential to replace the highly ambiguous serotyping method that currently is used for Leptospiral strain identification.[9] Ahmed has also worked extensively on the nomenclature, taxonomic status, genome sequencing and functional characterization of Mycobacterium indicus pranii,[10] a non-pathogenic mycobacterial species with very high translational promise as an immunotherapeutic. Ahmed taught courses in Molecular and Cell Biology, Intellectual Property Rights and Biosafety, Research and Publication Ethics and Research Methodology.[citation needed]/nNiyaz Ahmed served as Section Editor (Genomics and Microbiology) of PLoS ONE (from August 2008 to September 2013) wherein he provided editorial oversight to the \"PLoS ONE Prokaryotic Genome Collection\".[11] Ahmed also served as a member of the PLoS International Advisory Group and was the founding Editor-in-Chief of Gut Pathogens journal,[12] published by BioMed Central Ltd.

His pioneer work included the agricultural applications of phytohormones and synthetic analogs.[3]", "841432": "Mankombu Sambasivan Swaminathan (7 August 1925 \u2013 28 September 2023) was an Indian agronomist, agricultural scientist, plant geneticist, administrator, and humanitarian.[1] Swaminathan was a global leader of the green revolution.[2] He has been called the main architect[a] of the green revolution in India for his leadership and role in introducing and further developing high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice.[5][6] Swaminathan's collaborative scientific efforts with Norman Borlaug, spearheading a mass movement with farmers and other scientists and backed by public policies, saved India and Pakistan from certain famine-like conditions in the 1960s.[7][8] His leadership as director general of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines was instrumental in his being awarded the first World Food Prize in 1987, recognized as one of the highest honours in the field of agriculture.[9] The United Nations Environment Programme has called him \"the Father of Economic Ecology\".[10]/nSwaminathan contributed basic research related to potato, wheat, and rice, in areas such as cytogenetics, ionizing radiation, and radiosensitivity.[11] He was a president of the Pugwash Conferences and the International Union for Conservation of Nature.[12][13] In 1999, he was one of three Indians, along with Gandhi and Tagore, on Time's list of the 20 most influential Asian people of the 20th century.[5] Swaminathan received numerous awards and honours, including the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award, the Ramon Magsaysay Award, and the Albert Einstein World Science Award.[10] Swaminathan chaired the National Commission on Farmers in 2004, which recommended far-reaching ways to improve India's farming system.[14] He was the founder of an eponymous research foundation.[5] He coined the term \"Evergreen Revolution\" in 1990 to describe his vision of \"productivity in perpetuity without associated ecological harm\".[2][15] He was nominated to the Parliament of India for one term between 2007 and 2013.[16] During his tenure he put forward a bill for the recognition of women farmers in India.[17]/nSwaminathan was born in Kumbakonam, Madras Presidency, on 7 August 1925.[18] He was the second son of general surgeon M. K. Sambasivan and Parvati Thangammal Sambasivan. At age 11, after his father's death, Swaminathan was looked after by his father's brother.[19]/nSwaminathan was educated at a local high school and later at the Catholic Little Flower High School in Kumbakonam,[20] from which he matriculated at age 15.[21] From childhood, he interacted with farming and farmers; his extended family grew rice, mangoes, and coconut, and later expanded into other areas such as coffee.[22] He saw the impact that fluctuations in the price of crops had on his family, including the devastation that weather and pests could cause to crops as well as incomes.[23]/nHis parents wanted him to study medicine. With that in mind, he started off his higher education with zoology.[24] But when he witnessed the impacts of the Bengal famine of 1943 during the Second World War and shortages of rice throughout the sub-continent, he decided to devote his life to ensuring India had enough food.[25] Despite his family background, and belonging to an era where medicine and engineering were considered much more prestigious, he chose agriculture.[26]/nHe went on to finish his undergraduate degree in zoology at Maharaja's College in Trivandrum, Kerala (now known as University College, Thiruvananthapuram at the University of Kerala).[21] He then studied at University of Madras (Madras Agricultural College, now the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University) from 1940 to 1944 and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Agricultural Science.[27] During this time he was also taught by Cotah Ramaswami, a professor of agronomy.[28]/nIn 1947 he moved to the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) in New Delhi to study genetics and plant breeding.[29] He obtained a post-graduate degree with high distinction in cytogenetics in 1949. His research focused on the genus Solanum, with specific attention to the potato.[30] Social pressures resulted in him competing in the examinations for civil services, through which he was selected to the Indian Police Service.[31] At the same time, an opportunity for him arose in the agriculture field in the form of a UNESCO fellowship in genetics in the Netherlands. He chose genetics.[31]/nSwaminathan was a UNESCO fellow at the Wageningen Agricultural University's Institute of Genetics in the Netherlands for eight months.[32] The demand for potatoes during the Second World War resulted in deviations in age-old crop rotations. This caused golden nematode infestations in certain areas such as reclaimed agricultural lands. Swaminathan worked on adapting genes to provide resilience against such parasites, as well as cold weather. To this effect, the research succeeded.[33] Ideologically the university influenced his later scientific pursuits in India with respect to food production.[34] During this time he also made a visit to the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research in war-torn Germany; this would later influence him deeply as during his next visit, a decade later, he saw that the Germans had transformed Germany, both infrastructurally and energetically.[35]/nIn 1950, he moved to study at the Plant Breeding Institute of the University of Cambridge School of Agriculture.[36] He earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1952 for his thesis \"Species Differentiation, and the Nature of Polyploidy in certain species of the genus Solanum \u2013 section Tuberarium\".[36] The following December he stayed for a week with F.L. Brayne, a former Indian Civil Service officer, whose experiences with rural India influenced Swaminathan in his later years.[37]/nSwaminathan then spent 15 months in the United States.[38] He accepted a post-doctoral research associateship at the University of Wisconsin's Laboratory of Genetics to help set up a USDA potato research station.[38] The laboratory at the time had Nobel laureate Joshua Lederberg on its faculty.[39] His associateship ended in December 1953. Swaminathan turned down a faculty position in order to continue to make a difference back home in India.[40]/nSwaminathan returned to India in early 1954. There were no jobs in his specialisation and it was only three months later that he received an opportunity through a former professor to work temporarily as an assistant botanist at Central Rice Research Institute in Cuttack.[41] At Cuttack, he was under an indica-japonica rice hybridisation program started by Krishnaswami Ramiah. This stint would go on to influence his future work with wheat.[42] Half a year later he joined Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) in New Delhi in October 1954 as an assistant cytogeneticist.[41] Swaminathan was critical of India importing food grains when seventy percent of India was dependent on agriculture. Further drought and famine-like situations were developing in the country.[43]/nSwaminathan and Norman Borlaug collaborated, with Borlaug touring India and sending supplies for a range of Mexican dwarf varieties of wheat, which were to be bred with Japanese varieties.[45] Initial testing in an experimental plot showed good results. The crop was high-yield, good quality, and disease free.[46] There was hesitation by farmers to adopt the new variety whose high yields were unnerving.[46] In 1964, following repeated requests by Swaminathan to demonstrate the new variety, he was given funding to plant small demonstration plots. A total of 150 demonstration plots on 1 hectare were planted.[46] The results were promising and the anxieties of the farmers were reduced.[46] More modifications were made to the grain in the laboratory to better suit Indian conditions.[47] The new wheat varieties were sown and in 1968 production went to 17 million tonnes, 5 million tonnes more than the last harvest.[48]/nJust before receiving his Nobel Prize in 1970, Norman Borlaug wrote to Swaminathan:[49]/nThe Green Revolution has been a team effort and much of the credit for its spectacular development must go to the Indian officials, organizations, scientists, and farmers. However, to you, Dr. Swaminathan, a great deal of the credit must go for first recognizing the potential value of the Mexican dwarfs. Had this not occurred, it is quite possible that there would not have been a Green Revolution in Asia./nNotable contributions were made by Indian agronomists and geneticists such as Gurdev Khush and Dilbagh Singh Athwal.[8] The Government of India declared India self-sufficient in food production in 1971.[49] India and Swaminathan could now deal with other serious issues of access to food, hunger, and nutrition.[49][50][51] He was with IARI between 1954 and 1972.[1]/nIn 1972, Swaminathan was appointed as the director-general of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and a secretary to the Government of India.[52] In 1979, in a rare move for a scientist, he was made a principal secretary, a senior position in the Government of India.[53] The next year he was shifted to the Planning Commission.[54] As director-general of ICAR, he pushed for technical literacy, setting up centres all over India for this.[53] Droughts during this period led him to form groups to watch weather and crop patterns, with the ultimate aim of protecting the poor from malnutrition.[55] His shift to the Planning Commission for two years resulted in the introduction of women and environment with respect to development in India's five year plans for the first time.[54][52]/nIn 1982, he was made the first Asian director general of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines.[54] He was there until 1988.[1] One of the contributions he made during his tenure here was conducting an international conference \"Women in Rice Farming Systems\".[56] For this, the United States-based Association for Women in Development gave Swaminathan their first award for \"outstanding contributions to the integration of women in development\".[57] As director general, he spread awareness among rice-growing families of making the value of each part of the rice crop.[57] His leadership at IRRI was instrumental in the first World Food Prize being awarded to him.[9] In 1984 he became the president and vice-president of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and World Wildlife Fund respectively.[58]/nIn 1987 he was awarded the first World Food Prize.[59] The prize money was used to set up the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation.[60] Accepting the award, Swaminathan spoke of the growing hunger despite the increase in food production. He spoke of the fear of sharing \"power and resources\", and that the goal of a world without hunger remains unfinished.[61] In their commendation letters, Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar, Frank Press, President Ronald Reagan, and others recognized his efforts.[62]/nSwaminathan would go on to chair the World Food Prize Selection Committee following Borlaug.[63] In ICAR, from the late 1950s onwards, he taught cytogenetics, radiation genetics, and mutation breeding.[64] Swaminathan mentored numerous Borlaug\u2010Ruan interns, part of the Borlaug\u2010Ruan International Internship.[65]/nSwaminathan established the Nuclear Research Laboratory at the IARI. He played a role in and promoting the setting up of the International Crop Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics in India; the International Board for Plant Genetic Resources (now known as Bioversity International) in Italy and the International Council for Research in Agro-Forestry in Kenya. He helped to build and develop a number of institutions and provided research support in China, Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Iran, and Cambodia.[66]/nSwaminathan co-chaired the United Nations Millennium Project on hunger from 2002 to 2005 and was head of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs between 2002 and 2007.[67] In 2005 Bruce Alberts, President of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences said of Swaminathan: \"At 80, M.S. retains all the energy and idealism of his youth, and he continues to inspire good behaviour and more idealism from millions of his fellow human beings on this Earth. For that, we can all be thankful\".[68] Swaminathan had the aim of a hunger-free India by 2007.[69]/nSwaminathan was the chair of the National Commission on Farmers constituted in 2004.[71] In 2007, President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam nominated Swaminathan to the Rajya Sabha.[72] Swaminathan introduced one bill during his tenure, The Women Farmers' Entitlements Bill 2011, which lapsed.[16][73] One of the aims it proposed was recognising women farmers.[17]/nA term coined by Swaminathan, 'Evergreen Revolution', based on the enduring influence of the green revolution, aims to address the continuous increase in sustainable productivity that mankind requires.[74] He has described it as \"productivity with perpetuity\".[2]/nIn his later years, he had also been part of initiatives related to bridging the digital divide,[75] and bringing research to decision-makers in the field of hunger and nutrition.[76]/nHe was married to Mina Swaminathan, whom he met in 1951 while they were both studying at Cambridge.[77] They lived in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Their three daughters are Soumya Swaminathan (a paediatrician), Madhura Swaminathan (an economist), and Nitya Swaminathan (gender and rural development).[78]/nGandhi and Ramana Maharshi influenced his life.[79] Of the 2000 acres owned by their family, they donated one-third to Vinoba Bhave's cause.[80] In an interview in 2011, he said that when he was young, he followed Swami Vivekananda.[81]/nSwaminathan died at home in Chennai on 28 September 2023, at age 98.[82]/nIn the 1950s, Swaminathan's explanation and analysis of the origin and evolutionary processes of potato was a major contribution.[83] He elucidated its origin as an autotetraploid and its cell division behaviour.[84] His findings related to polyploids were also significant.[84] Swaminathan's thesis in 1952 was based on his basic research related to \"species differentiation and the nature of polyploidy in certain species of the genus Solanum, section Tuberarium\".[85] The impact was the greater ability to transfer genes from a wild species to the cultivated potato.[86]/nWhat made his research on potatoes valuable was its real-world application in the development of new potato varieties.[87] During his post-doctoral at Wisconsin University, he helped develop a frost-resistant potato.[87] His genetic analysis of potatoes, including the genetic traits that govern yield and growth, important factors in increasing productivity, was pivotal. His multi-disciplinary systems approach perspective brought together many different genetic facets.[88]/nIn the 1950s and 1960s Swaminathan did basic research into the cytogenetics of hexaploid wheat.[86] The varieties of wheat and rice developed by Swaminathan and Borlaug were foundational to the green revolution.[88]/nEfforts towards growing rice with C4 carbon fixation capabilities, which would allow a better photosynthesis and water usage, were started at IRRI under Swaminathan.[88] Swaminathan also played a role in the development of the world's first high-yielding basmati.[89]/nThe Genetics Division of the IARI under Swaminathan was globally renowned for its research on mutagens.[85] He set up a 'Cobalt-60 Gamma Garden' to study radiation mutation.[84][86] Swaminathan's association with Homi J. Bhabha, Vikram Sarabhai, Raja Ramana, M. R. Srinivasan and other Indian nuclear scientists allowed agricultural scientists to access facilities at the Atomic Energy Establishment, Trombay (which would later become the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre).[85] Swaminathan's first PhD student, A. T. Natarajan, would go on to write his thesis in this direction.[85] One of the aims of such research was to increase plant responsiveness to fertilisers and demonstrate real-world application of crop mutations.[86] Swaminathan's early basic research on the effects of radiation on cells and organisms partly formed the base of future redox biology.[90]/nRudy Rabbinge\u00a0[nl] calls Swaminathan's paper on neutron radiation in agriculture in 1966 presented at an International Atomic Energy Agency conference in the United States  as \"epoch-making\".[84] The work of Swaminathan and his colleagues was relevant to food irradiation.[84]/nSwaminathan received the Mendel Memorial Medal from the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences in 1965.[91] Following this he received numerous international awards and honours, including the Ramon Magsaysay Award (1971),[6] the Albert Einstein World Science Award (1986), the first World Food Prize (1987),[10] the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement (1991),[91] the Four Freedoms Award (2000),[92] and the Planet and Humanity Medal of the International Geographical Union (2000).[93] When accepting the Ramon Magsaysay Award, Swaminathan quoted Seneca: \"A hungry person listens neither to reason, nor to religion, nor is bent by any prayer.\"[94]/nHe was conferred with the Order of the Golden Heart of the Philippines,[95] the Order of Agricultural Merit of France, the Order of the Golden Ark of Netherlands,[96] and the Royal Order of Sahametrei of Cambodia.[91] China awarded him with the \"Award for International Co-operation on Environment and Development\".[97] In the 'Dr Norman E. Borlaug Hall of Laureates' at Des Moines, Iowa, United States, there is an artwork of Swaminathan made up of 250,000 pieces of glass.[98] The IRRI has named a building and a scholarship fund after him.[91]/nOne of the first national awards he received was the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award in 1961.[52] Following this he was conferred with the Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Vibhushan awards, as well as the H K Firodia award, the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Award, and the Indira Gandhi Prize.[99] As of 2016, he had received 33 national and 32 international awards.[100] In 2004, an agricultural think-tank in India named an annual award after Swaminathan, the eponymously named 'Dr. M.S. Swaminathan Award for Leadership in Agriculture'.[101]/nSwaminathan was the recipient of 84 honorary doctorates and was a guide for numerous Ph.D. scholars.[99][102] Sardar Patel University conferred him with an honorary degree in 1970; Delhi University, Banaras Hindu University and others would follow.[83] Internationally, the Technical University of Berlin (1981) and the Asian Institute of Technology (1985) honoured him.[83] The University of Wisconsin honoured Swaminathan with an honorary doctorate in 1983.[103] When the University of Massachusetts, Boston, honoured him with a science doctorate, they commented on the \"magnificent inclusiveness of [Swaminathan's] concerns, by nation, socioeconomic group, gender, inter-generational, and including both human and natural environments\".[104] Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, from where he received his PhD in botany, made him an honorary fellow in 2014.[105]/nSwaminathan had been elected a fellow of a number of science academies in India. Internationally he had been recognised as a fellow by 30[102] academies of science and societies across the world including the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, Sweden, Italy, China, Bangladesh, as well as the European Academy of Arts, Science and Humanities.[99][106] He was a founder fellow of The World Academy of Sciences.[99] The National Agrarian University in Peru conferred him with an honorary professorship.[83]/nSwaminathan published 46 single-author papers between 1950 and 1980. In total he had 254 papers to his credit, 155 of which he was the single or first author. His scientific papers are in the fields of crop improvement (95), cytogenetics and genetics (87) and phylogenetics (72). His most frequent publishers were Indian Journal of Genetics (46), Current Science (36), Nature (12) and Radiation Botany (12).[107] Selected publications include:/nIn addition he has written a few books on the general theme of his life's work, biodiversity and sustainable agriculture for alleviation of hunger. Swaminathan's books, papers, dialogues and speeches include:/nIn the 1970s, a scientific paper in which Swaminathan and his team claimed to have produced a mutant breed of wheat by gamma irradiation of a Mexican variety (Sonora 64) resulting in Sharbati Sonora, claimed to have a very high lysine content, led to a major controversy. The case was claimed to be an error made by the laboratory assistant.[108] The episode was also compounded by the suicide of an agricultural scientist.[109][110][111][112][113] It has been studied as part of a systemic problem in Indian agriculture research.[114]/nA paper published in the  25 November 2018 edition of Current Science titled 'Modern Technologies for Sustainable Food and Nutrition Security' listed Swaminathan as a co-author.[115] The article was criticised by a number of scientific experts, including K. VijayRaghavan, the principal scientific adviser to the Government of India, who commented that it was \"deeply flawed and full of errors\".[115][116][117] Swaminathan claimed that his role in the paper was \"extremely limited\" and that he shouldn't have been named as the co-author.[115][118]", "1529570": "David William Rasnick (born 1948) is an American biochemist known for his association with the AIDS denialist movement, which denies the fact that HIV is the cause of AIDS,[1] and for his involvement with clinical trials in South Africa promoting vitamins for the treatment of AIDS, which were later ruled illegal by the South African judiciary.[2]/nDavid Rasnick received a PhD in chemistry from Georgia Tech in 1978; his thesis was entitled \"Affinity Labeling of Metalloendoproteases.\"[3] Rasnick studied proteases in rats and has also written a book about the aneuploidy theory of cancer.[1][4]/nRasnick was a prominent member of the AIDS-denialist movement, which claimed that HIV either did not exist, or did not cause AIDS.

Hardin currently serves as a distinguished professor in the biology department at Texas A&M University.[1] He is best known for his discovery of circadian oscillations in the mRNA  of the clock gene Period (per), the importance of the E-Box in per activation, the interlocked feedback loops that control rhythms in activator gene transcription, and the circadian regulation of olfaction in Drosophila melanogaster. Born in a suburb of Chicago, Matteson, Illinois, Hardin currently resides in College Station, Texas, with his wife and three children./nHardin earned his B.S. in biology at Southern Methodist University (SMU) in 1982. He then continued to pursue a Ph.D in genetics from Indiana University in 1987 with William H. Klein. He went on to conduct his postdoctoral research at Brandeis University under the supervision of chronobiologist Michael Rosbash.[2] From 1991 to 1995, Hardin worked as a professor at Texas A&M University, and from 1995 to 2005 at the University of Houston. Since 2005, Hardin has worked as a professor and researcher in the biology department at Texas A&M University. He teaches courses on introductory biology, molecular cell biology, and a graduate level class on biological clocks. He also serves as the director of the Texas A&M's Center for Biological Clocks Research and as faculty for the Texas A&M Institute for Neuroscience and PhD program in genetics.[1] In addition, Hardin was also actively involved in the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms; he served as the secretary in 2006, treasurer in 2010, and president in 2016.[3]/nIn 1971, Ron Konopka, a geneticist at the California Institute of Technology, discovered the Period gene, which he found to be involved in the circadian clock of Drosophila.[4] In 1999, Paul Hardin discovered that per mRNA underwent strong circadian oscillations by exposing isolated wild-type per mRNA to a series of light-dark (LD) cycles followed by cycles of constant darkness (DD).[5] As a post-doctorate in the lab of chronobiologist Dr. Michael Rosbash, Hardin specifically noted that per mRNA levels in Drosophila brains fluctuate about 10-fold in a typical 24-hour light-dark cycle. Hardin further demonstrated that  wild-type protein, PER, can rescue rhythmicity in the mRNA of an arrhythmic mutant of the per gene. His findings suggested that feedback of the PER protein regulates levels of per mRNA.[6] Hardin ultimately published his seminal work on the rhythmic nature of per mRNA in Drosophila in the journal Nature. This discovery led Hardin and other prominent members in the field of chronobiology to develop a model that describes the clock mechanism in Drosophila. This model is referred to as the Transcription Feedback Loop, which suggests that the translated protein provides negative feedback on the mRNA transcription of itself.[6]/nIn 1997, Hardin, with Haiping Hao and David Allen, analyzed the sequence of the per gene in Drosophila and found a 69-bp enhancer upstream of the gene. This enhancer sequence contained an E-box (CACGTG), which was determined to be necessary for high-level per transcription.[7] As E-boxes are typically bound by proteins containing a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein structural motif, the presence of an E-box in per led to the hypothesis that the proteins involved in circadian rhythms may contain a bHLH domain. This proved to be vital in establishing the function of the previously discovered CLOCK protein, which was known to play a role in circadian rhythms and contained a bHLH domain as well. This discovery also aided in the identification of the BMAL1 and CYCLE proteins as critical players in the circadian rhythms of mammalian and Drosophila circadian systems respectively.[7]/nWhile teaching at the University of Houston, Hardin, along with fellow scientists Balaji Krishnan and Stuart Dryer, investigated circadian rhythms of olfaction in Drosophila. Previous experiments had shown that Drosophila antennae demonstrate circadian rhythms. However, the mechanism for circadian rhythms in the antennae was unknown. To determine the mechanism of rhythms in antennae, Hardin and his team kept wild-type and mutant flies, per01 and tim01, in 12:12 light-dark (LD) cycles and measured olfaction in the antennae with an electroantennogram (EAG), that measures the average output of an insect antenna to its brain for a given odor, over a 24-hour period. Only the wild-type flies demonstrated rhythmicity in the electrical activity, which indicated that circadian rhythms were present in the olfactory response.[8] In contrast, the mutants showed no cyclic activity. Therefore, Hardin's team discovered that circadian rhythms control the olfactory response in Drosophila antennae and his results were eventually published in Nature.[9]/nIn 1999, Hardin along with Nick Glossop and Lisa Lyons, conducted research on the specific role of Clk in the interlocked feedback loops present in Drosophila circadian oscillators. It was previously known that five genes (per, tim, dbt, Clk, and cyc) controlled circadian rhythms in Drosophila. The per-tim regulation mechanism was known at this time, though Clk regulation was not yet known.[10]/nHardin and his team conducted a series of experiments to identify the two interlocked feedback loops in the circadian mechanism of Drosophila. This means that the per-tim feedback loop connects to the Clk-cyc feedback loop, so that one loop has an effect on the other, and vice versa. They measured wild-type and mutant Clk mRNA levels to identify any changes in transcription levels. They observed that the PER-TIM complex suppresses transcription. They hypothesized that the Clk repressor was either the CLK-CYC complex itself or a repressor that was activated by CLK-CYC. They observed that the presence of active CLK and CYC resulted in the repression of Clk, while arrhythmic per mutants exhibited low levels of Clk. This evidence led them to propose the following model regarding two interlocked feedback loops:[11][12]/nIn 2003, Hardin's team uncovered the second feedback loop associated with the circadian clock. vrille (vri) and Par Domain Protein 1 (Pdp1) encode related transcription factors whose expression is directly activated by dCLOCK/CYCLE. They show that VRI and PDP1 proteins feed back and directly regulate dClock expression.  Thus, VRI and PDP1, together with dClock itself, comprise a second feedback loop in the Drosophila clock that gives rhythmic expression of dClock, and probably of other genes, to generate accurate circadian rhythms.[13]/nHardin's current research centers on the function of the circadian clock in Drosophila melanogaster.[19] One of Hardin's main research topics is understanding the mechanism behind the circadian rhythms in olfaction and gustatory physiology. His research also focuses on understanding the role of post-translational regulatory mechanisms in the feedback loop that set a 24-hour rhythm. Lastly, his lab has been working on identifying if the interlocked loops in the feedback mechanism function as a circadian oscillator or a clock output.[1] His most recent article discusses the conservation of the transcription feedback loop in not only Drosophila, but also in other animal species as well.[20]", "7493365": "Lorne Allan Babiuk, OC SOM FRSC (born January 25, 1946) is a Canadian scientist specializing in immunology, pathogenesis, virology, molecular virology, and vaccinology.

He was named after his grandfather,\nJuda Quastel, a chemist in Tarnapol.[5]/nHe was educated at Sheffield Central Secondary School. In the First World War, he served with the British Army as a Laboratory Assistant at St George's Hospital from 1917 to 1919./nElecting to study chemistry, Quastel received a baccalaureate from Imperial College London in 1921. Pursuing graduate work at the University of Cambridge, Quastel studied with Frederick Gowland Hopkins, the leading figure in British biochemistry and a future Nobel Prize recipient for his work on the nutritional importance of vitamins. Under Hopkins, Quastel received a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of Cambridge in biochemistry in 1924 and, not long after, was made a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge./nQuastel remained in Hopkins\u2019 department as a demonstrator and lecturer from 1923 to 1929, during which he pioneered the research of microbial enzymology. He obtained a doctorate of science from Cambridge in 1926 and received a Beit Memorial Fellowship in 1928./nQuastel accepted a position as Director of Research at the Cardiff City Mental Hospital in 1930. From this location, he was able to conduct early work on the enzymology and metabolism of the brain. For these studies, Quastel was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1940.[6]/nIn 1941, when Britain's wartime food supply emerged as a strategic concern, the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) asked Quastel to lead a new research unit focused on improving crop yield at the Rothamsted Experimental Station. By analyzing soil as a dynamic system, rather than an inert substance, he was able to apply techniques such as perfusion, with which he had become familiar in studies of animal organs.[7] On this approach, Quastel later wrote (1946) that \"soil as a whole can be considered an organ comparable in some respects to a liver or a gland to which may be added various nutrients, pure or complex degraded plant materials, rain, air, and in which enzymatic reactions can occur.\"[citation needed]/nUsing these techniques, Quastel was able to quantify the influence of various plant hormones, inhibitors and other chemicals on the activity of microorganisms in the soil and assess their direct impact on plant growth. While the full work of the unit remained secret, certain discoveries were developed for commercial use after the war. Best known is the compound commonly labeled as 2,4-D, one of the first systemic or hormone herbicides, a class of chemicals responsible for triggering a worldwide revolution in agricultural output and still the most widely used weed-killer in the world. Another invention was developed as a soil conditioner and is marketed by Monsanto Company under the trade name Krilium.[8]/nAfter World War II, Quastel was invited to become Assistant Director of the newly founded McGill University-Montreal General Hospital Research Institute and professor of biochemistry at McGill University, and, in 1947, he accepted the invitation. The following year, he was appointed Director of the Institute./nDuring his nineteen years at McGill, Quastel supervised seventy PhD candidates and his Institute published over three hundred scientific papers on topics including metabolism of micro-organisms, soil biochemistry, neurobiochemistry, neurotropic drugs, anaesthesia, cancer biochemistry, enzyme inhibition, and transport of nutrients and ions across membranes.

The first edition of American Men of Science[3] described her being educated through private schools while growing up.[2]  Foot was a member of the New York Women's club Sorosis.[1] The Advancement of Women club was organized under Sorosis and included the prominent member Alice Fletcher, the American Indian ethnographer. Foot was interested in Native American culture, and became president of the Washington auxiliary of the Women's National Indian Association, an organization that lobbied on behalf of Native Americans, in the mid 1800s. She accompanied Fletcher on a trip to Alaska to study native culture in the area. However, their opportunities for communicating with Native American communities did not work out as planned.

Additionally, they developed a technique for creating samples at low temperatures for viewing under the microscope.[2]/nBetween 1906 and 1913, Foot and Strobell researched certain stages of chromosomal development of squash bugs. This was believed to be done in a Laboratory of their own in New York City.[1] Foot and Strobell participated in debates on the role of chromosomes in transmitting definite units of hereditary information such as sex-linked characteristics. They defended their position against T.H. Morgan. In 1914, Foot and Strobell traveled to England to continue their research under Harry Eltringham of New College Oxford.

Vakoch led METI's participation in S\u00f3nar Calling GJ 273b, which transmitted a series of interstellar messages to Luyten's Star, located 12.4 light years from Earth. Vakoch advocates ongoing transmission projects, arguing that this does not increase risks of an alien invasion as suggested by British cosmologist Stephen Hawking. He has participated in several SETI observation programs, and after sixteen years at the SETI Institute, where he was director of Interstellar Message Composition, Vakoch founded METI International. He has edited over a dozen books in SETI, astrobiology, the psychology of space exploration, and ecocriticism. He is general editor of two-book series in ecocriticism and in the intersection of space and society. Vakoch has appeared widely on television and radio as a commentator on SETI and astrobiology. He is an emeritus professor of clinical psychology at the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS)./nDouglas Vakoch grew up in rural Minnesota.[2] He created his first interstellar message as a high school student\u2014a series of two-dimensional pictures that built upon a message transmitted from Arecibo Observatory in 1974.[3][4] \"The issue that really hit me early on, and that has stayed with me, is just the challenge of creating a message that would be understandable,\" he told The New York Times Magazine.[5] Vakoch earned a bachelor's degree in comparative religion from Carleton College, a master's degree in history and philosophy of science from the University of Notre Dame, and a PhD in psychology from Stony Brook University.[2] He completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Vanderbilt University before he accepted a position at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California.[2]/nVakoch argues that in order to make contact, humankind may need to take the initiative in transmitting, a project called active SETI.[6] He has been called \"a prominent voice in favor of active SETI,\"[6] \"the most prominent METI [messaging to extraterrestrial intelligence] proponent,\"[7] and \"the man who speaks for Earth.\"[8] In Discover's ranking of scientists either in favor of or opposed to transmitting, Vakoch was cited as \"super pro,\" at the extreme of those advocating messaging.[9] After sixteen years at the SETI Institute,[10] where he was director of Interstellar Message Composition,[3][10] Vakoch founded METI (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence),[11] a nonprofit research and educational organization.[3]/nIn 2010, Vakoch was one of the leaders of Project Dorothy, a multinational effort launched by Japanese astronomer Shin-ya Narusawa to observe several stars for signals from other civilizations to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of Project Ozma, the first modern-day search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).[12] Telling The Washington Post about the Project Dorothy observations, Vakoch said \"[w]hat this weekend really does is begin the process of making it possible to track a possible SETI signal around the globe,\" and he added \"[i]f a signal is detected, it has to be confirmed and followed, and now we're setting up a network to do that.\"[12]/nVakoch contends that it is essential to expand an understanding of SETI beyond the technology needed to search by also re-examining assumptions about the nature of intelligence, which was the motivation for the METI workshop, \u201cThe Intelligence of SETI: Cognition and Communication in Extraterrestrial Intelligence,\u201d[11] held in San Juan, Puerto Rico on May 18, 2016.[13] \"By studying the variety of intelligence found on Earth,\" Vakoch said, \"we can gain new insights into sending messages to life on other planets.\"[14] He called for \"rethinking what SETI means,\" saying \"what we haven't caught up with is the real understanding of intelligence.\"[15] Vakoch told the International Business Times that \"[i]n this new approach, we're putting the intelligence back into SETI.\"[15] He argues that the fact that extraterrestrial intelligence may rely on different senses than humans adds to the complexity of interspecies communication.[16][17][18]/nVakoch \"leads an international group of scientists, artists and scholars from the humanities, as they ponder how we could communicate what it\u2019s like to be human across the vast distances of interstellar space.\"[19] He advocates creating interstellar messages that begin with concepts shared by humans and extraterrestrials, such as basic mathematics and science and building on these shared concepts to express content that may be distinctly human.[20] He argues that while mathematics and science provide the best starting point for interstellar messages, it is possible that extraterrestrial mathematics and science may vary significantly from human mathematics and science.[21] He notes that on Earth both Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries provide internally consistent frameworks for understanding the world, but they vary in their foundational assumptions.[18][22]/nIn contrast to the images included on the Voyager Golden Record that emphasized the positive aspects of life on Earth, Vakoch proposes that we should be honest about human frailties.[23][24][25] He suggests that the most informative things that humankind can convey to an advanced civilization are the struggles humankind is going through as an adolescent technological civilization.[19][20][26][16] Vakoch argues that if we contact other civilizations, they will likely be thousands or millions of years older than humanity's civilization, meaning the extraterrestrial civilization would have greater stability.[27] \"Perhaps it is not the beauty of our symphonies that will set us apart from extraterrestrials, nor our moral perfection \u2013 living true to our ideals of altruism. If we wish to convey what it is about us that is distinctive, it may be our weakness, our fears, our unknowing \u2013 and yet a willingness to forge ahead to attempt contact in spite of this,\" Vakoch told The Psychologist.[17]/nVakoch calls for increasing the range of people participating in interstellar message design, and he led a workshop in Paris in 2002 on the interface of art and science in interstellar messages.[28] Speaking to Reuters on the day of the meeting, he said \"Today the focus has been on whether we can explain something about our aesthetic sensibilities. Is there something about art that is either universal or that can be taught, step by step, to another intelligence?\"[28]/nVakoch also led meetings attended by anthropologists and sociologists,[29] and he advocates interstellar messages that capture the diversity of human cultures.[30][16]/nVakoch has contributed to the study of space exploration, most notably through books examining psychological dimensions of space travel. The Journal of Military History noted about Vakoch's edited book Psychology of Space Exploration: Contemporary Research in Historical Perspective that \"[f]or those interested in an overview and synthesis of some of the key issues in the psychology of space exploration, this book provides a great introduction,\" adding that \"[m]ost interestingly to those whose primary interest lies in history, many of the chapters engage the history of the psychology of space exploration quite well, most notably in the book\u2019s first two chapters.\"[31][32] Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine observed that \"[t]his book is unique in that it places much of the ongoing research and interest in the topic of human behavior and performance in space in historical perspective\" and concluded that \"[i]t is certainly worthwhile reading for those directly involved in the next phase of human exploration of space as well as those who will witness this phase from the confines of Earth.\"[33] Isis wrote that \"[t]his diverse and thought-provoking collection represents an important departure for the NASA History Series, a turn from works focused on machines, missions, and management structures to a concern with the smaller group of space sciences interested in human subjects, like space medicine and human factors engineering\" and noted that the book \"represents an important step in bringing the human-focused space sciences to the attention of a wider audience.\"[34]/nThe Journal of Mind and Behavior noted that Vakoch's follow-up book On Orbit and Beyond: Psychological Perspectives on Human Spaceflight includes several chapters that address the implications of the increased autonomy that astronauts would have on missions to Mars and Saturn, as compared to orbiting Earth or travelling to the Moon.[35][36] In an interview Vakoch explained the implications of this increased autonomy: \"On missions to Mars, where greater autonomy will be expected of astronauts because of the greater distances, ground personnel should expect that their own roles will change over the course of the mission. Unless ground personnel are prepared, they may feel like they are no longer playing as central a role as they did shortly after liftoff because astronauts are now making more decisions.\"[37]/nAt the 2008 annual convention of the American Psychological Association, Vakoch chaired the symposium \"To the Moon and Mars: Psychology of Long-Duration Space Exploration,\"[38] which was identified as a \"highlight\" of the convention.[39]/nVakoch has also examined unmanned space exploration. Commenting on plans to send miniature spacecraft to a nearby star, he told the International Business Times that \"[b]y sending hundreds or thousands of space probes the size of postage stamps, Breakthrough Starshot gets around the hazards of spaceflight that could easily end a mission relying on a single spacecraft. Only one nanocraft needs to make its way to Alpha Centauri and send back a signal for the mission to be successful. When that happens, Starshot will make history.\"[40] Focusing within the Solar System, he commented on NASA's plans to send a lander to Jupiter's moon Europa, telling Gizmodo that \"[t]he top priority of this lander mission will be to search for evidence of life on Europa,\" adding that \"even if that main goal isn\u2019t met, we will learn a great deal about the potential habitability of this icy moon, which will be essential for future, even more ambitious missions.\"[41]/nVakoch has collaborated on several empirical studies of human cognition. His research in psycholinguistics with Lee Wurm explores the perception of speech and emotion from an evolutionary framework,[42][43] with their findings indicating that \"speech perception and the affective lexicon\" are \"closely tied together.\"[44] Vakoch's experimental work with Yuh-Shiow Lee suggests that complex rules are learned better through implicit learning, while simple rules are learned better though explicit learning,[45] with their research suggesting that \"implicit learning can be more efficient than explicit learning.\"[46] Vakoch and the late psychotherapy researcher Hans Herrman Strupp suggested that the expert understanding of experienced psychotherapists is not adequately captured by manualized psychotherapy,[47] and they argued that manualized training can impede \"the development of clinical judgment and complex reasoning.\"[48][49]/nTrailer[63]/nVakoch has appeared frequently on television networks including the Discovery Channel, BBC, PBS, and History Channel./nVakoch, D.

McClintock received her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927. There she started her career as the leader of the development of maize cytogenetics, the focus of her research for the rest of her life. From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize. She developed the technique for visualizing maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas. One of those ideas was the notion of genetic recombination by crossing-over during meiosis\u2014a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. She produced the first genetic map for maize, linking regions of the chromosome to physical traits. She demonstrated the role of the telomere and centromere, regions of the chromosome that are important in the conservation of genetic information. She was recognized as among the best in the field, awarded prestigious fellowships, and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1944./nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, McClintock discovered transposition and used it to demonstrate that genes are responsible for turning physical characteristics on and off. She developed theories to explain the suppression and expression of genetic information from one generation of maize plants to the next. Due to skepticism of her research and its implications, she stopped publishing her data in 1953./nLater, she made an extensive study of the cytogenetics and ethnobotany of maize races from South America. McClintock's research became well understood in the 1960s and 1970s, as other scientists confirmed the mechanisms of genetic change and protein expression that she had demonstrated in her maize research in the 1940s and 1950s. Awards and recognition for her contributions to the field followed, including the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, awarded to her in 1983 for the discovery of genetic transposition; as of 2022, she remains the only woman who has received an unshared Nobel Prize in that category.[2]/nBarbara McClintock was born Eleanor McClintock on June 16, 1902, in Hartford, Connecticut,[3][4] the third of four children born to homeopathic physician Thomas Henry McClintock and Sara Handy McClintock.[5] Thomas McClintock was the child of British immigrants. Marjorie, the oldest child, was born in October 1898; Mignon, the second daughter, was born in November 1900. The youngest, Malcolm Rider (called Tom), was born 18 months after Barbara. When she was a young girl, her parents determined that Eleanor, a \"feminine\" and \"delicate\" name, was not appropriate for her, and chose Barbara instead.[4][6]  McClintock was an independent child beginning at a very young age, a trait she later identified as her \"capacity to be alone\". From the age of three until she began school, McClintock lived with an aunt and uncle in Brooklyn, New York, in order to reduce the financial burden on her parents while her father established his medical practice. She was described as a solitary and independent child. She was close to her father, but had a difficult relationship with her mother, tension that began when she was young.[4][6]/nThe McClintock family moved to Brooklyn in 1908 and McClintock completed her secondary education there at Erasmus Hall High School;[6][7] she graduated early in 1919.[3] She discovered her love of science and reaffirmed her solitary personality during high school.[4] She wanted to continue her studies at Cornell University's College of Agriculture. Her mother resisted sending McClintock to college for fear that she would be unmarriageable, a common attitude at the time.[6] McClintock was almost prevented from starting college, but her father allowed her to just before registration began, and she matriculated at Cornell in 1919.[8][9]/nMcClintock began her studies at Cornell's College of Agriculture in 1919. There, she participated in student government and was invited to join a sorority, though she soon realized that she preferred not to join formal organizations. Instead, McClintock took up music, specifically jazz. She studied botany, receiving a BSc in 1923.[8] Her interest in genetics began when she took her first course in that field in 1921. The course was based on a similar one offered at Harvard University, and was taught by C. B. Hutchison, a plant breeder and geneticist.[10][11][12] Hutchison was impressed by McClintock's interest, and telephoned to invite her to participate in the graduate genetics course at Cornell in 1922. McClintock pointed to Hutchison's invitation as a catalyst for her interest in genetics: \"Obviously, this telephone call cast the die for my future. I remained with genetics thereafter.\"[13] Although it has been reported that women could not major in genetics at Cornell, and therefore her MS and PhD\u2014earned in 1925 and 1927, respectively\u2014were officially awarded in botany, recent research has revealed that women were permitted to earn graduate degrees in Cornell's Plant Breeding Department during the time that McClintock was a student at Cornell.[14]/nDuring her graduate studies and postgraduate appointment as a botany instructor, McClintock was instrumental in assembling a group that studied the new field of cytogenetics in maize. This group brought together plant breeders and cytologists, and included Marcus Rhoades, future Nobel laureate George Beadle, and Harriet Creighton.[15][16][17] Rollins A. Emerson, head of the Plant Breeding Department, supported these efforts, although he was not a cytologist himself.[18][19]/nShe also worked as a research assistant for Lowell Fitz Randolph and then for Lester W. Sharp, both Cornell botanists.[20]/nMcClintock's cytogenetic research focused on developing ways to visualize and characterize maize chromosomes. This particular part of her work influenced a generation of students, as it was included in most textbooks. She also developed a technique using carmine staining to visualize maize chromosomes, and showed for the first time the morphology of the 10 maize chromosomes. This discovery was made because she observed cells from the microspore as opposed to the root tip.[18][21] By studying the morphology of the chromosomes, McClintock was able to link specific chromosome groups of traits that were inherited together.[22] Marcus Rhoades noted that McClintock's 1929 Genetics paper on the characterization of triploid maize chromosomes triggered scientific interest in maize cytogenetics, and attributed to her 10 of the 17 significant advances in the field that were made by Cornell scientists between 1929 and 1935.[23]/nIn 1930, McClintock was the first person to describe the cross-shaped interaction of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. The following year, McClintock and Creighton proved the link between chromosomal crossover during meiosis and the recombination of genetic traits.[22][24] They observed how the recombination of chromosomes seen under a microscope correlated with new traits.[17][25] Until this point, it had only been hypothesized that genetic recombination could occur during meiosis, although it had not been shown genetically.[17] McClintock published the first genetic map for maize in 1931, showing the order of three genes on maize chromosome 9.[26]  This information provided necessary data for the crossing-over study she published with Creighton;[24] they also showed that crossing-over occurs in sister chromatids as well as homologous chromosomes.[27] In 1938, she produced a cytogenetic analysis of the centromere, describing the organization and function of the centromere, as well as the fact that it can divide.[22]/nMcClintock's breakthrough publications, and support from her colleagues, led to her being awarded several postdoctoral fellowships from the National Research Council. This funding allowed her to continue to study genetics at Cornell, the University of Missouri, and the California Institute of Technology, where she worked with E. G. Anderson.[14][27] During the summers of 1931 and 1932, she worked at the University of Missouri with geneticist Lewis Stadler, who introduced her to the use of X-rays as a mutagen. Exposure to X-rays can increase the rate of mutation above the natural background level, making it a powerful research tool for genetics. Through her work with X-ray-mutagenized maize, she identified ring chromosomes, which form when the ends of a single chromosome fuse together after radiation damage.[28] From this evidence, McClintock hypothesized that there must be a structure on the chromosome tip that would normally ensure stability. She showed that the loss of ring-chromosomes at meiosis caused variegation in maize foliage in generations subsequent to irradiation resulting from chromosomal deletion.[22] During this period, she demonstrated the presence of the nucleolus organizer region on a region on maize chromosome 6, which is required for the assembly of the nucleolus.[22][27][29] In 1933, she established that cells can be damaged when nonhomologous recombination occurs.[22][30] During this same period, McClintock hypothesized that the tips of chromosomes are protected by telomeres.[31]/nMcClintock received a fellowship from the Guggenheim Foundation that made possible six months of training in Germany during 1933 and 1934.[28] She had planned to work with Curt Stern, who had demonstrated crossing-over in Drosophila just weeks after McClintock and Creighton had done so; however, Stern emigrated to the United States. Instead,  she worked with geneticist Richard B. Goldschmidt, who was a director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Berlin.[6][32] She left Germany early amidst mounting political tension in Europe, returned to Cornell, but found that the university would not hire a woman professor.[33] In 1936, she accepted an Assistant Professorship offered to her by Lewis Stadler in the Department of Botany at the University of Missouri in Columbia.[34][35] While still at Cornell, she was supported by a two-year Rockefeller Foundation grant obtained for her through Emerson's efforts.[28]/nDuring her time at Missouri, McClintock expanded her research on the effect of X-rays on maize cytogenetics. McClintock observed the breakage and fusion of chromosomes in irradiated maize cells. She was also able to show that, in some plants, spontaneous chromosome breakage occurred in the cells of the endosperm. Over the course of mitosis, she observed that the ends of broken chromatids were rejoined after the chromosome replication.[36] In the anaphase of mitosis, the broken chromosomes formed a chromatid bridge, which was broken when the chromatids moved towards the cell poles. The broken ends were rejoined in the interphase of the next mitosis, and the cycle was repeated, causing massive mutation, which she could detect as variegation in the endosperm.[37] This breakage\u2013rejoining\u2013bridge cycle was a key cytogenetic discovery for several reasons.[36] First, it showed that the rejoining of chromosomes was not a random event, and second, it demonstrated a source of large-scale mutation. For this reason, it remains an area of interest in cancer research today.[38]/nAlthough her research was progressing at Missouri, McClintock was not satisfied with her position at the university. She recalled being excluded from faculty meetings, and was not made aware of positions available at other institutions.[6] In 1940, she wrote to Charles Burnham, \"I have decided that I must look for another job. As far as I can make out, there is nothing more for me here. I am an assistant professor at $3,000 and I feel sure that that is the limit for me.\"[39][36] Initially, McClintock's position was created especially for her by Stadler, and might have depended on his presence at the university.[14][34] McClintock believed she would not gain tenure at Missouri, even though according to some accounts, she knew she would be offered a promotion from Missouri in the spring of 1942.[40] Recent evidence reveals that McClintock more likely decided to leave Missouri because she had lost trust in her employer and in the university administration, after discovering that her job would be in jeopardy if Stadler were to leave for Caltech, as he had considered doing. The university's retaliation against Stadler amplified her sentiments.[14]/nIn early 1941, she took a leave of absence from Missouri in hopes of finding a position elsewhere. She accepted a visiting Professorship at Columbia University, where her former Cornell colleague Marcus Rhoades was a professor. Rhoades also offered to share his research field at Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island. In December 1941, she was offered a research position by Milislav Demerec, the newly appointed acting director of the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Department of Genetics Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; McClintock accepted his invitation despite her qualms and became a permanent member of the faculty.[41]/nAfter her year-long temporary appointment, McClintock accepted a full-time research position at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. There, she was highly productive and continued her work with the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle, using it to substitute for X-rays as a tool for mapping new genes. In 1944, in recognition of her prominence in the field of genetics during this period, McClintock was elected to the National Academy of Sciences\u2014only the third woman to be elected. The following year she became the first female president of the Genetics Society of America;[3] she had been elected its vice-president in 1939.[35] In 1944 she undertook a cytogenetic analysis of Neurospora crassa at the suggestion of George Beadle, who used the fungus to demonstrate the one gene\u2013one enzyme relationship. He invited her to Stanford to undertake the study. She successfully described the number of chromosomes, or karyotype, of N. crassa and described the entire life cycle of the species. Beadle said, \"Barbara, in two months at Stanford, did more to clean up the cytology of Neurospora than all other cytological geneticists had done in all previous time on all forms of mold.\" [42] N. crassa has since become a model species for classical genetic analysis.[43][44]/nIn the summer of 1944 at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, McClintock began systematic studies on the mechanisms of the mosaic color patterns of maize seed and the unstable inheritance of this mosaicism.[45] She identified two new dominant and interacting genetic loci that she named Dissociation (Ds) and Activator (Ac). She found that the Dissociation did not just dissociate or cause the chromosome to break, it also had a variety of effects on neighboring genes when the Activator was also present, which included making certain stable mutations unstable. In early 1948, she made the surprising discovery that both Dissociation and Activator could transpose, or change position, on the chromosome.[46][47][48][49]/nShe observed the effects of the transposition of Ac and Ds by the changing patterns of coloration in maize kernels over generations of controlled crosses, and described the relationship between the two loci through intricate microscopic analysis.[50][51] She concluded that Ac controls the transposition of the Ds from chromosome\u00a09, and that the movement of Ds is accompanied by the breakage of the chromosome.[49] When Ds moves, the aleurone-color gene is released from the suppressing effect of the Ds and transformed into the active form, which initiates the pigment synthesis in cells.[52] The transposition of Ds in different cells is random, it may move in some but not others, which causes color mosaicism. The size of the colored spot on the seed is determined by stage of the seed development during dissociation. McClintock also found that the transposition of Ds is determined by the number of Ac copies in the cell.[53]/nBetween 1948 and 1950, she developed a theory by which these mobile elements regulated the genes by inhibiting or modulating their action. She referred to Dissociation and Activator as \"controlling units\"\u2014later, as \"controlling elements\"\u2014to distinguish them from genes. She hypothesized that gene regulation could explain how complex multicellular organisms made of cells with identical genomes have cells of different function.[53] McClintock's discovery challenged the concept of the genome as a static set of instructions passed between generations.[3] In 1950, she reported her work on Ac/Ds and her ideas about gene regulation in a paper entitled \"The origin and behavior of mutable loci in maize\" published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In summer 1951, she reported her work on the origin and behavior of mutable loci in maize at the annual symposium at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, presenting a paper of the same name. The paper delved into the instability caused by Ds and Ac or just Ac in four genes, along with the tendency of those genes to unpredictably revert to the wild phenotype. She also identified \"families\" of transposons, which did not interact with one another.[3][54][49]/nHer work on controlling elements and gene regulation was conceptually difficult and was not immediately understood or accepted by her contemporaries; she described the reception of her research as \"puzzlement, even hostility\".[55][49] Nevertheless, McClintock continued to develop her ideas on controlling elements. She published a paper in Genetics in 1953, where she presented all her statistical data, and undertook lecture tours to universities throughout the 1950s to speak about her work.[56] She continued to investigate the problem and identified a new element that she called Suppressor-mutator (Spm), which, although similar to Ac/Ds, acts in a more complex manner. Like Ac/Ds, some versions could transpose on their own and some could not; unlike Ac/Ds, when present, it fully suppressed the expression of mutant genes when they normally would not be entirely suppressed.[57] Based on the reactions of other scientists to her work, McClintock felt she risked alienating the scientific mainstream, and from 1953 was forced to stop publishing accounts of her research on controlling elements.[3][47]/nIn 1957, McClintock received funding from the National Academy of Sciences to start research on indigenous strains of maize in Central America and South America. She was interested in studying the evolution of maize through chromosomal changes,[58] and being in South America would allow her to work on a larger scale. McClintock explored the chromosomal, morphological, and evolutionary characteristics of various races of maize.[59][31] After extensive work in the 1960s and 1970s, McClintock and her collaborators published the seminal study The Chromosomal Constitution of Races of Maize, leaving their mark on paleobotany, ethnobotany, and evolutionary biology.[60]/nMcClintock officially retired from her position at the Carnegie Institution in 1967,[3] and was made a Distinguished Service Member of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.[41] This honor allowed her to continue working with graduate students and colleagues in the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory as scientist emerita; she lived in the town.[61] In reference to her decision 20 years earlier to stop publishing detailed accounts of her work on controlling elements, she wrote in 1973:/nOver the years I have found that it is difficult if not impossible to bring to consciousness of another person the nature of his tacit assumptions when, by some special experiences, I have been made aware of them. This became painfully evident to me in my attempts during the 1950s to convince geneticists that the action of genes had to be and was controlled. It is now equally painful to recognize the fixity of assumptions that many persons hold on the nature of controlling elements in maize and the manners of their operation. One must await the right time for conceptual change.[62]/nThe importance of McClintock's contributions was revealed in the 1960s, when the work of French geneticists Fran\u00e7ois Jacob and Jacques Monod described the genetic regulation of the lac operon, a concept she had demonstrated with Ac/Ds in 1951. Following Jacob and Monod's 1961 Journal of Molecular Biology paper \"Genetic regulatory mechanisms in the synthesis of proteins\", McClintock wrote an article for American Naturalist comparing the lac operon and her work on controlling elements in maize.[63][57] Even late in the twentieth century, McClintock's contribution to biology was still not widely acknowledged as amounting to the discovery of genetic regulation.[47]/nMcClintock was widely credited with discovering transposition after other researchers finally discovered the process in bacteria, yeast, and bacteriophages in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[64] During this period, molecular biology had developed significant new technology, and scientists were able to show the molecular basis for transposition.[65] In the 1970s, Ac and Ds were cloned by other scientists and were shown to be class II transposons. Ac is a complete transposon that can produce a functional transposase, which is required for the element to move within the genome. Ds has a mutation in its transposase gene, which means that it cannot move without another source of transposase. Thus, as McClintock observed, Ds cannot move in the absence of Ac.[66] Spm has also been characterized as a transposon. Subsequent research has shown that transposons typically do not move unless the cell is placed under stress, such as by irradiation or the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle, and thus their activation during stress can serve as a source of genetic variation for evolution.[67] McClintock understood the role of transposons in evolution and genome change well before other researchers grasped the concept. Nowadays, Ac/Ds is used as a tool in plant biology to generate mutant plants used for the characterization of gene function.[68]/nIn 1947, McClintock received the Achievement Award from the American Association of University Women. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1959.[69] In 1967, McClintock was awarded the Kimber Genetics Award;[70] three years later, she was given the National Medal of Science by Richard Nixon in 1970.[64][71] She was the first woman to be awarded the National Medal of Science.[72]\nCold Spring Harbor named a building in her honor in 1973.[31] She received the Louis and Bert Freedman Foundation Award and the Lewis S. Rosensteil Award in 1978.[70] In 1981, she became the first recipient of the MacArthur Foundation Grant, and was awarded the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research,[73] the Wolf Prize in Medicine and the Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal by the Genetics Society of America. In 1982, she was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University for her research in the \"evolution of genetic information and the control of its expression.\"[74][31]/nMost notably, she received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1983, the first woman to win that prize unshared,[61] and the first American woman to win any unshared Nobel Prize.[75] It was given to her by the Nobel Foundation for discovering \"mobile genetic elements\";[76] this was more than 30 years after she initially described the phenomenon of controlling elements. She was compared to Gregor Mendel in terms of her scientific career by the Swedish Academy of Sciences when she was awarded the Prize.[77]/nShe was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1989.[78] McClintock received the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Distinguished Achievement in the Sciences of the American Philosophical Society in 1993.[79] She had been previously elected to the APS in 1946.[80] She was awarded 14 Honorary Doctor of Science degrees and an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters.[31] In 1986 she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. During her final years, McClintock led a more public life, especially after Evelyn Fox Keller's 1983 biography of her, A Feeling for the Organism, brought McClintock's story to the public. She remained a regular presence in the Cold Spring Harbor community, and gave talks on mobile genetic elements and the history of genetics research for the benefit of junior scientists. An anthology of her 43 publications The Discovery and Characterization of Transposable Elements: The Collected Papers of Barbara McClintock was published in 1987.[73]/nThe McClintock Prize is named in her honor.[81] Laureates of the award include David Baulcombe, Detlef Weigel, Robert A. Martienssen, Jeffrey D. Palmer  and Susan R. Wessler.[81]/nIn May 2005 the U.S. Postal Service issued a panel of first-class stamps honoring Barbara McClintock, along with Richard Feynman, Josiah Willard Gibbs, and John von Neumann.[82]/nMcClintock spent her later years, post Nobel Prize, as a key leader and researcher in the field at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, New York.  McClintock died of natural causes in Huntington, New York, on September 2, 1992, at the age of 90; she never married or had children.[61][73][83]/nMcClintock was the subject of a 1983 biography by physicist Evelyn Fox Keller, titled A Feeling for the Organism. Keller argued that because McClintock felt like an outsider within her field, (in part, because of her sex) she was able to look at her scientific subjects from a perspective different from the dominant one, leading to several important insights.[84] Keller shows how this led many of her colleagues to reject her ideas and undermine her abilities for many years. For example, when McClintock presented her findings that the genetics of maize did not conform to Mendelian distributions, geneticist Sewall Wright expressed the belief that she did not understand the underlying mathematics of her work, a belief he had also expressed towards other women at the time.[85] In addition, geneticist Lotte Auerbach recounted that Joshua Lederberg returned from a visit to McClintock's lab with the remark: 'By God, that woman is either crazy or a genius.' \" As Auerbach recounts, McClintock had thrown Lederberg and his colleagues out after half an hour 'because of their arrogance. She was intolerant of arrogance\u00a0... She felt she had crossed a desert alone and no one had followed her.'\"[86][87]/nIn 2001, a second biography by science historian Nathaniel C. Comfort's The Tangled Field: Barbara McClintock's Search for the Patterns of Genetic Control challenged this narrative. Comfort's biography contests the claim that McClintock was marginalized by other scientists, which he calls the \"McClintock Myth\" and argues was perpetuated both by McClintock herself as well as in the earlier biography by Keller.  Comfort, however, asserts that McClintock was not discriminated against because of her gender, citing that she was well regarded by her professional peers, even in the early years of her career.[88]/nMany recent biographical works on women in science feature accounts of McClintock's work and experience. She is held up as a role model for girls in such works of children's literature as Edith Hope Fine's Barbara McClintock, Nobel Prize Geneticist, Deborah Heiligman's Barbara McClintock: Alone in Her Field and Mary Kittredge's Barbara McClintock. A recent biography for young adults by Naomi Pasachoff, Barbara McClintock, Genius of Genetics, provides a new perspective, based on the current literature.[89]/nOn May 4, 2005, the United States Postal Service issued the \"American Scientists\" commemorative postage stamp series, a set of four 37-cent self-adhesive stamps in several configurations.  The scientists depicted were Barbara McClintock, John von Neumann, Josiah Willard Gibbs, and Richard Feynman. McClintock was also featured in a 1989 four-stamp issue from Sweden which illustrated the work of eight Nobel Prize-winning geneticists. A laboratory building at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory were named for her. A street has been named after her in the new \"Adlershof Development Society\" science park in Berlin.[90]/nA 103,835 square-foot residence hall at Cornell University was named for McClintock in 2022.[91][92]/nSome of McClintock's personality and scientific achievements were referred to in Jeffrey Eugenides's 2011 novel The Marriage Plot, which tells the story of a yeast geneticist named Leonard who has bipolar disorder. He works at a laboratory loosely based on Cold Spring Harbor. The character reminiscent of McClintock is a reclusive geneticist at the fictional laboratory, who makes the same discoveries as her factual counterpart.[93]/nJudith Pratt wrote a play about McClintock, called MAIZE, which was read at Artemesia Theatre in Chicago in 2015, and was produced in Ithaca NY, the home of Cornell University, in February\u2013March 2018.[94]", "58087317": "John Dennis Biggers (/\u02c8b\u026a\u0261\u0259rs/; 1923 \u2013 April 7, 2018) was a British and American reproductive biologist and reproductive physiologist who helped pioneer in vitro fertilisation.

Howard W.

(Lond.). He joined the Indian Medical Service on 28 January 1898 with the rank of second-lieutenant. All Indian Medical Service officers at that time were required to complete a course in pathology at Netley Hospital under Dr (later Sir) Almroth Wright. In 1899 Wright requested that Douglas accompany him to India for the investigative research of the first Plague Commission. On 31 March 1899 Douglas and H. J. Walton (at that time a lieutenant) were sent to investigate plague in the Garhwal District and other areas of the Kumaon Division of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh.[2] Their investigation lasted about 5 months, during which Douglas suffered from recurring episodes of malaria. After completing this investigation, Douglas was sent in 1900 to China as part of the medical staff for the Gaselee Expedition in connection with the Boxer Rebellion. In China he was promoted to the rank of captain on 28 January 1901. However, in China he became infected with amoebic dysentery and developed a liver abscess. (From 1901 to the end of his life he suffered serious health problems.) He was given a medical discharge from the Indian Medical Service. Douglas returned to the UK and joined Almroth Wright at St Mary's Hospital to do research on vaccine therapy. For a pension from the Indian Medical Service, Douglas was put on temporary half pay on 15 September 1905 and was put on permanent half pay on 15 September 1907. In 1909 he was appointed a lecturer at St Mary's Hospital Medical School.[1]/nWhen World War I started, the supply of peptones from Germany was cut off. Peptones were used by British bacteriologists in nutrient media for growing Salmonella typhi as part of the programme for preparing vaccines against typhoid fever. Within a few days, Douglas produced a new and superior peptone medium for bacterial culture. He joined Wright in Boulogne-sur-Mer but developed sciatica and returned to the UK for treatment. In 1915 he returned to work at St Mary's on vaccines against typhoid and other bacterial infections. Douglas also did research on dysentery. In 1916 he worked in St Mary Hospital's special wards for wounded soldiers and developed a successful method of autologous skin-grafting./nIn 1921 Douglas was appointed director of the Department of Bacteriology and Experimental Pathology in the National Institute for Medical Research under the direction of Sir Henry Dale at Mount Vernon Hospital in Hampstead and also deputy director for the NIMR under the director Dale.[3] As head of his department, Douglas organised the research of Laidlaw, Dobell, William E. Gye (who worked on the Rous sarcoma virus), Ian A. Galloway (who worked on foot-and-mouth disease) and other researchers. Much of the research dealt with immunology and virology, especially viruses that cause dysentery. Douglas worked on the extraction of bacteria by acetone. This extraction method led to Georges Dreyer's 'diaplyte'[4] and Dreyer's synthetic medium for the growth of tubercle bacilli; Dreyer's advances lead to a more effective form of tuberculin skin test.[5]/nIt was a newspaper report suggesting that German secret agents had infiltrated the London Underground in order to carry out experiments with bacteria that prompted the British government to seek expert advice on the potential of biological warfare from a small number of civilian scientists consulted in secret. The most influential were Professor John Ledingham, Director of the Lister Institute; the epidemiologist and bacteriologist Professor William Topley of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; and Captain Stewart Ranken Douglas, Deputy Director of the National Institute for Medical Research.

In 2006, she and a research partner discovered a species thought to be extinct and in 2010, she was awarded the National Geographic's \"Young Explorer Grant\". She became the first Bolivian scientist to win a L'Or\u00e9al-UNESCO Fellowship for Women in Science in 2012 and in 2013 was named by the BBC as one of the top ten Latin American women of science./nKathrin Barboza M\u00e1rquez was born in 1983 and grew up in Cochabamba, Bolivia.[1] She is the only daughter of Mario Pablo Barboza C\u00e9spedes and Mar\u00eda Alcira M\u00e1rquez Zurita.[2] She attended the Universidad Mayor de San Sim\u00f3n (UMSS)[3] and studied at the Center of Biodiversity and Genetics.[4] In 2003, Barboza M\u00e1rquez was studying biology with a focus on conservation. As punishment for losing a bet with friends, she had to attend a lecture on bats by Dr. Luis Aguirre, a visiting professor and bat expert. Little did Barboza M\u00e1rquez know that it would change the course of her life and career. \"I went and was immediately hooked by everything I heard,\" she remembers with a smile. \"I didn't know how important they [bats] were, that there were so many variations, that they ate so many things.\"[5]  \"Generally, people have negative perceptions about bats: that they are bad luck, that they suck blood, that they're a menace, but that's not true,\" Kathrin shares.[5] After attending the lecture, Barboza M\u00e1rquez decided to continue on the conservation track, but with a focus on bats instead.[5] Shortly after she took a course in bats bioacoustics and the German scientist and ecologist Elisabeth Kalko became one of her mentors.[6] As a student, she researched the reproductive patterns of fruit bats for her thesis and worked with her mentor Aide\u00e9 Vargas to conduct a year-long expedition to track down the Nariz de Espada (the sword-nosed bat), a species believed to have become extinct in Bolivia since the early 1930s.[5]/nStationed in caves near Bolivia's border with Brazil (a location known to be a hub for drug traffickers), Barboza M\u00e1rquez remembers the toll the trip took on her physically, mentally and emotionally. \"It was the first time that I seriously asked myself if all of this was worth it,\" she recalls. All of her uncertainty melted away, however, when she laid eyes on the Nariz de Espada. \"Our finding meant that, at least in Bolivia, the species was not extinct and that we could begin work on its conservation. The feeling was incredible and overwhelming,\" she says.[5] In 2006, Barboza M\u00e1rquez and Aide\u00e9 Vargas rediscovered a species of bat thought to have been extinct in Bolivia for 72 years.[3][7] The species, known as the Bolivian sword-nosed bat (Lonchorhina aurita)[8] is now protected in an area of the Santa Cruz Department known as the Ecological Sanctuary of the Town of San Juan de Corralito located in the \u00c1ngel Sandoval Province.[3] This is the first area specifically designated to protect a species of bat in Latin America.[8] She then continued her education to earn a Masters in Biology and Conservation of Tropical Areas from the Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo International University. The degree program was offered by the Higher Council for Scientific Research of Spain, but classes were completed in Quito in a cooperative study arrangement with the Central University of Ecuador.[3]/nSince 2010, Barboza M\u00e1rquez has traveled to many countries and taught about the bio-acoustics of bats[9] and their benefits to society. Primarily, the two types of bats are insect-eating and pollinating. Those that eat insects provide important pest-control services to zoomophilous plants including the agave from which tequila is made,[10] mangoes, bananas and guavas.[11] As part of her doctorate research, Barboza M\u00e1rquez studied the bat species in Madrid[12] in conjunction with the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales,[9] where 27 of the native bat species are endangered.[12] After her research in Madrid was complete, Barboza M\u00e1rquez returned to Cochabamba to finish the work on her PhD and participate in projects with the Conservation of Bats in Bolivia project and the Latin American Network for the Conservation of Bats.[9] \"Being a woman in science is really a privilege, especially in my country,\" Kathrin shares. \"I have had some cases of machismo and I realised how often we normalise it or don't speak up for ourselves. There is not only discrimination for being a female scientist but also for being young. My merit and the value of my work were questioned several times because I am a young woman scientist.\"[5]/nTo see more young women in the conservation field, Barboza M\u00e1rquez suggests that schools and universities \"create spaces for young girls to engage in conversations with women in the field.\" For girls interested in pursuing careers as conservationists, Barboza M\u00e1rquez advises studying biology at university. In the fall of 2019, fires ravaged over 4.2 million acres of land in Bolivia, including the Chiquitano forest, a unique ecoregion where Barboza M\u00e1rquez worked for six years. From her current home in La Paz, Barboza M\u00e1rquez worked to assist the devastated lands, which included educating the public about the fires and their effects on Bolivian nature and wildlife. \"We are gathering information so we can publish as much as possible about the problem and make people aware so we can unite in the efforts to save what's left,\" she shares. Barboza M\u00e1rquez knows that there's a lot of work ahead in the fight to protect Bolivia's biodiversity and bats, but through her research and advocacy, she is making progress every day for the country's natural habitats and mammals, particularly her two-taloned friends.[5]/nNow with over a decade of experience under her belt, Barboza M\u00e1rquez has taught bat bioacoustic courses across Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica, Peru, Spain and Uruguay. She currently works as an associate investigator of mammalogy, the study of mammals, at the Natural History Museum Alcide d'Orbigny. She also teaches courses on fieldwork, flora and fauna inventories and biodiversity at the environmental education startup, Natural Zone.[5]/nIn addition to biology, Barboza Marquez enjoys the practice of pilates, to which she dedicates between four and seven hours a day. That activity that started accidentally, but has become another of her passions. She is currently an instructor and board member of Mundo Pilates, a center specialized in that technique in Cochabamba. \"I learned about Pilates because of an injury that I had in my back due to an accident that I suffered on one of my trips. I liked it, I was cured and began to become aware of the importance of good posture. It helps me clear my mind,\" she says. She also confesses his interest in baking and on her days off her greatest entertainment is watching a good movie at home.[2]/nBarboza M\u00e1rquez won a grant in 2007 from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute to conduct research at Barro Colorado Island in Panama.[3] Her project focused on the forest and island borders' effects on the habitat of the island bat population.[13]/nUpon completion of her work in Panama, Barboza M\u00e1rquez won the 2009 National Geographic, Young Explorer Scholarship Grant. She used the scholarship funds to conduct research on the acoustics of bats in the Beni Savanna of northern Bolivia. She created one of the first libraries of echolocation frequencies for insectivorous bats in Bolivia.[9] \"Bats have taken me to many countries that I never expected to know. For me the most important thing in life is to be in touch with nature. Listening to them is an indescribable emotion, it is about making something that nobody can hear audible,\" concludes the biologist.[6] In addition, she and other scientists conducted a study of ectoparasites on the bat population of the savanna. No comprehensive study had ever been conducted on parasitism of bat colonies. The scientists used mist nets to capture and release their study subjects over a five-month period at the Spirit Wildlife Refuge. As a result, they have cataloged more than 20 morphotypes of mites and ticks and studies are on-going to identify the remaining samples.[14]/nIn 2012, she was awarded one of the L'Or\u00e9al-UNESCO Fellowships for Women in Science and became the first Bolivian to win the award.[15]  \"I remember crying with happiness and pride for being able to represent Bolivia at an event of that magnitude because we know that science in Latin America is not valued. So, for me, this reinforced how important it was to champion girls and women in science back in my country and in Latin America.\"[5] She used her award to further her study of the ultrasound spectrum of bats, which is not within the human hearing range. The manner of the call, frequency, duration and pulse-intervals are recorded to determine whether bats are communicating or are searching for food. The recordings also help to determine which species live in certain areas.[9]/nIn 2013, she was named as one of the ten leading women scientists of Latin America by the BBC.[7]", "66541493": "Jill Reiss Harper (born 1972)[1] is an American molecular biologist and policy advisor serving as the deputy director for science management and executive officer at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases./nHarper earned a B.S. in biology with a minor in chemistry from Oglethorpe University in 1994.

The Red Queen Hypothesis captures the idea that there is a constant 'arms race' between co-evolving species.

What I work on changes irregularly and unpredictably with the progress of theory and knowledge. I am currently writing a book that expands on my perspective (the Red Queen's hypothesis) of trophic energy as a major controller of evolution and ecology.  Some recent topics: (1) The evolution of biotas can be approached through changes in patterns of energy flow and their control. I am looking at the basal Cenozoic radiation of placental mammals from this perspective; there are surprisingly large changes in the group selection causing the changes, and in its components; (2) Single-species populations of birds decrease in density with body size at the same rate as the total energy flow through single individuals increases. A student found a similar pattern for mammals. This implies a community regulation of absolute fitnesses, if one accepts my heretical (ecological) view of the nature of fitness; (3)The actual levels of selection in the current rapid evolution of our own species differ from standard concepts and are generalizable; (4) Charles Lyell used (real) species selection before Darwin.

Ralph is a circadian biologist who serves as a professor in the Psychology Department at the University of Toronto. His research primarily focuses on circadian rhythmicity in the fields of neuroscience, psychology, and endocrinology. His most notable work was has been on the suprachiasmatic nucleus, now recognized as the central circadian pacemaker in mammals, but has also investigated circadian rhythms in the context of time, memory, and light./nMartin Ralph attended Stanford University from 1972 to 1976 where he earned his Bachelor's Degree in Biology. He then received his Doctorate while attending the University of Oregon from 1982 to 1986.[1] After earning his Ph.D, he stayed and worked under circadian biologist Dr. Michael Menaker at the University of Virginia where he most notably helped discover the tau mutation in golden hamsters. In 1998, he joined the University of Toronto as a Professor of Psychology./nWhile working as a grad student under Dr. Michael Menaker, one of the modern grandfathers of circadian biology, he discovered a golden hamster that had a period noticeably less than 24 hours. The motor activity rhythms of Golden hamsters typically follow periods of 24 hours, with little variation.[2] After further breeding these mutant hamsters, he noticed that homozygous mutants had a 20 hour period of daily activity rhythms and heterozygous mutants had a 22 hours period.[3] In circadian biology, tau (\u03c4), denoted the duration of a rhythm in an organism, so a circadian rhythm has a tau value near 24 hours. Given the differences in period, he decided to name this mutant strain the \u201ctau hamster.\u201d This hamster was the first evidence of a genetic basis to circadian rhythms in mammals, and it has been used as a model to further study the genetic basis of circadian rhythmicity and the rhythmicity in specific proteins and behaviors besides locomotion such as body size[4] and melatonin expression.[5]/nHe later worked with a team of circadian biologists led by Dr. Joseph Takahashi to identify the location of the mutation responsible for tau mutant hamster's 20 hour period. They used genetically directed representational difference analysis (GDRDA), an assay used to connect genetic mutations to a specific trait,[6] to discern the genetic differences between the mutant and wild-type hamsters. They localized the area of genetic differences to chromosome 22 in the region encoding the casein kinase 1 epsilon (CK1\u03b5) gene.[7] They showed that CK1\u03b5 interacts with the PERIOD gene, which has been established as a mammalian circadian gene,[8] and this activity was decreased in the mutant version of CK1\u03b5, presenting an explanation for the behavior of the tau mutant hamster./nOne of the first uses of the mutant (tau) golden hamster was the identification of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) as an important pacemaker of locomotive daily rhythms. When the SCN was ablated in wild-type hamsters, they lost rhythmic locomotor activity. They then transplanted a new SCN from a donor hamster and observed restored rhythmicity in the receiving hamster with the same period as the donor hamster. If the donor was wild-type, they observed a 24 hour period, and if the donor was homozygous mutant, they observed a 20 hour period. This experiment proved both the necessity and sufficiency of the SCN to generate daily sleep-wake rhythms in these hamsters.[9] Circadian researchers continued to study the SCN, and this structure is now recognized as the primary circadian pacemaker in mammals./nSome of Dr. Ralph\u2019s most cited work includes his contributions that showed masking by light. Masking refers to the ability for external cues such as the light that can influence animal behavior by being integrated into the circadian rhythm. As the animal continues to have its innate biological clock, other exogenous cues are factored in that enable the animal to respond right away to environmental changes. For example, having a pulse of light during a diurnal animal\u2019s rest phase could lead to a change in period and rhythmicity, even for some time after the short stimulus.[10]\nIn his work done with Dr. Gary Pickard in the Menaker lab, Dr. Ralph studied mice which had their intergeniculate leaflet (IGL), a retinal pathway important for perceiving light, surgically removed.[11]/nOverall, they found that lesioned mice had increased phase delays and were less responsive to phase shifts due to light pulses. Additionally, the active period of the mice did not lengthen with constant light conditions. These data suggested that the IGL likely played a major role in feeding light information back to the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Later experiments done with the golden hamster added to these results and suggested that the circadian response is dependent on the \u201cenvironmental situation\u201d at which the light is given.[12]/nWhile working in the Menaker lab, Ralph also investigated GABA regulation of circadian responses to light. They found that the GABA antagonist bicuculline blocks phase delays and the benzodiazepine diazepam (a potentiator of GABA activity) blocks phase advances in golden hamsters exposed to light. The bicuculline-induced blockade of phase delays was decreased by activators of GABA activity, while the diazepam-induced blockade of phase advances could be decreased by competitive and noncompetitive antagonists of GABA. These findings suggest that the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor-ionophore complex is likely the site of action for the circadian alterations of these drugs. Interestingly, they found that other GABA agonists and antagonists did not produce the same blocking of phase advances and phase delays that diazepam and bicuculline did, respectively, suggesting an alternative mechanism other than changes in chloride conductance.[13]/nAnother area of Dr. Ralph\u2019s research is on the circadian rhythm\u2019s effect on learning. Working on mice, Dr. Ralph and other researchers found that the timing of an important event is encoded by a condition entrainable oscillator that is set by an acute change in dopamine transmission at the time of the event, allowing animals to learn and remember the time of day that significant conditions occur and anticipate recurrence at 24 hour intervals. Dr. Ralph has also found that circadian modulation of conditioned place avoidance in hamsters does not require the SCN (suprachiasmatic nucleus), suggesting that memory for time of day may require a circadian oscillator separate from the SCN.[14][15]/nAnother area of Martin\u2019s research focuses on the impact of circadian rhythm disruption on longevity. While the functional role of circadian rhythms had been well established, little was known about the adaptiveness of daily oscillations in physiology and behavior in organisms. He found that the tau mutant hamster had significantly reduced lifespans compared to wild-type and homozygous tau mutant hamsters. Transplanting fetal brain grafts with SCN reversed the decline in behavioral rhythmicity naturally associated with age and extended longevity by 20% in adult hamsters. In fact, 11 of the hamsters that received SCN grafting outlived 50% of all controls, with grafting of other brain tissue types resulting in similar life expectancy as controls. These findings suggest that clock speed slows down with age and decreased behavioral rhythms (measured as running time) are highly predictive of lifespan within a few weeks.[16]/nRalph's SCN transplantation study not only showed the role of the SCN, but it also showed the ability of a neural transplant to restore lost function. This same procedure is being explored as a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases. A study conducted in 2020 explored whether the transplantation of functional tissue from induced-pluripotent stem cells could restore function for a patient suffering from Parkinson\u2019s disease. After confirming that the graft successfully survived, they found that over the course of two years the patient\u2019s symptoms improved or remained constant. It is worth mentioning that this was only conducted in one patient.[17] A recent meta-analysis (2022) of neural transplantation studies showed that replacing dopamine-producing cells with stem-cell derived equivalents is not only safe for patients but can improve motor function and daily living ability.[18] Another study similar to Dr. Ralph\u2019s work includes work done in 2014 which showed that transplantation of interneurons led to the restoration of memory and cognitive function in an Alzheimer\u2019s disease mouse model In particular, the transplantation of inhibitory interneurons shed light on the role inhibition plays in generating normal function through interplay with excitatory neurons.[19]/nRalph continued his interest in circadian research at the University of Toronto, specifically in smaller mammalian models of mice and hamsters. His lab investigates the behavior of proteins that regulate and exhibit circadian rhythms and how both zeitgebers and protein mutations affect their expression and animal behavior. He has studied these topics primarily in the fields of neuroscience and psychology.[20] Most recently, his lab studied how circadian proteins are modulated for specific memory tasks independent of the overall circadian clock. They observed that implicit time-memory, an unconscious memory of a specific time that can be anticipated during which a significant event repeatedly occurs, modulates PER2 mRNA expression only in the striatum of the brain and without affecting the overall circadian clock. This research provides evidence to begin answering the question of where time memory anatomically is located in the brain, which is currently unknown.[21]/nMember of the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms since 1988.[20]/nA.P.

Kondo held the title of Designated Professor and Professor Emeritus of Nagoya University.[4][5] Kondo died from pneumonia on 16 November 2023, at the age of 75.[6]/nKondo was best known for his discoveries surrounding the molecular basis of the cyanobacteria circadian clock. Prior to Kondo's work in the late 1980s, controversy surrounding the existence of a biological clock in bacteria. Since bacteria divide rapidly and several times per day, it was thought that there was no necessity to evolve a biological clock in bacteria.[7] Promoter-trap and microarray analysis performed by Kondo in the cyanobacteria Synechococcus revealed that many, if not all, genes displayed a rhythmic, circadian component to their expression.[7] Kondo next employed a forward genetics approach and developed a luciferase reporter system to identify clock mutants in Synechococcus. Mutations that altered circadian behavior were grouped in a single region of the Synechococcus genome.[1] From this observation, Kondo discovered the gene cluster kaiABC as a circadian feedback process in cyanobacteria in 1998.[8] In 2002, Kondo demonstrated that kaiA-stimulated kaiC phosphorylation is necessary for circadian timing loops in cyanobacteria.[7] In 2005, Kondo succeeded in reconstituting the circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial kaiC phosphorylation in vitro.[9] Kondo's seminal 2005 discovery was the first example of a recapitulated biological rhythm in a test tube, mimicked rhythms observed in eukaryotic cells, and disproved the universal necessity of the transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop.[7] Kondo's characterization of kaiABC behavior provided a molecular mechanism by which proteins respond to changes in time and enabled the fields of bacterial genetics and quantitative biochemistry to aid investigation of the biological clock.[10]", "65329314": "Fellow of the Royal Society of Biology\nUniversity of London Leading Women\nJohn Black Charitable Foundation-Prostate Cancer Foundation Challenge Award\nVictoria and Vinny Smith \u2013 Prostate Cancer Foundation Challenge Award\nAmerican Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Team Science Award/nProfessor Bissan Al-Lazikani PhD FRSB MBCS is a data scientist and drug discoverer.

At age fourteen he entered a gymnasium (high school) in Darmstadt with the expectation that he would follow his father into the ministry. While at school Marx became interested in botany and displayed such an aptitude as an artist that he was employed to illustrate a book on the local flora. Against his father's wishes, he decided to study pharmacy because it would provide him an opportunity to pursue his interest in botany.[1][2]/nAfter completing his pharmaceutical studies at Giessen Marx traveled to the United States in 1860. At the outbreak of the Civil War he enlisted in the Union Army and served as a private until the First Battle of Bull Run in  July 1861. Afterwards, his expertise in pharmacy and medicine resulted in a transfer to the medical corps where he served as an assistant surgeon. In July 1862 Marx was honorably discharged because of illness and a severe wound.[1]/nAfter receiving his discharge, Marx settled in New York City and worked as a pharmacist for the duration of the war. In 1865 he moved to Philadelphia, started a business, and married Minnie Maurer. While in Philadelphia he became interested in collecting and studying spiders.  In 1878, he took a position in Washington D.C. working as a natural history illustrator for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the Division of Entomology. He earned a reputation as a skilled artist and many of the Division's publications were illustrated with his works. In 1889 he was appointed chief of the USDA's newly established Division of Illustrations. His colleagues said the \"plates and figures which adorn his contributions to science are by far the best illustrations of Arachnids that have ever been produced in America\".[1]/nIn addition to his work on illustrations, Marx continued to collect and study spiders. He published his first paper, \"On Some New Tube-Constructing Spiders\" in 1881 and went on to write some thirty additional papers on arachnids, many of them illustrated with his own drawings. He was recognized as an authority on spiders and collaborated with noted arachnologists in America and Europe including Tamerlan Thorell, Eug\u00e8ne Simon, James Henry Emerton and George Williams Peckham.

His grandfather, Benjamin S. Walcott, moved from Rhode Island in 1822. His father, also Charles Doolittle Walcott, died when Charles Jr. was only two. Walcott was the youngest of four children.[3] He was interested in nature from an early age, collecting minerals and bird eggs and, eventually, fossils. He attended various schools in the Utica area but left at the age of eighteen without completing high school, the end of his formal education.[4] His interest in fossils solidified as he became a commercial fossil collector.[4]/nOn January 9, 1872, Walcott married Lura Ann Rust, daughter of the owner of a farm in New York where Walcott made one of his most important trilobite discoveries (Walcott-Rust quarry). She died on January 23, 1876. Walcott's interest in fossils led to his acquaintance with Louis Agassiz of Harvard University, who encouraged him to work in the field of paleontology; later that year, he began work as the assistant to the state paleontologist, James Hall. He lost this job after two years but was soon recruited to the newly formed US Geological Survey as a geological assistant.[4]/nWalcott began his professional paleontology career by discovering new localities, such as the Walcott-Rust quarry in upstate New York and the Georgia Plane trilobite beds in Vermont, and by selling specimens to Yale University. In 1876, he became the assistant to James Hall, State Geologist of New York. Walcott also became a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science./nIn 1879, Walcott joined the US Geological Survey and rose to become chief paleologist in 1893 and then director in 1894. His work focused on Cambrian strata in locations throughout the United States and Canada; his numerous field trips and fossil discoveries made important contributions to stratigraphy./nHe married Helena Breese Stevens in 1888.

In 1901, he served both as president of the Geological Society of America[5] and the Philosophical Society of Washington.[6] In 1902, he met with Andrew Carnegie and became one of the founders and incorporators of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. He served in various administrative and research positions in that organization. In 1921 Walcott was awarded the inaugural Mary Clark Thompson Medal from the National Academy of Sciences.[7]/nHe served as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1923. He previously spearheaded the U.S. Geological Survey under President Theodore Roosevelt.[4]/nWalcott had an interest in the conservation movement and assisted its efforts.[4]/nWalcott became Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in 1907 after the death of Samuel Pierpont Langley, holding the post until his own death. He was succeeded by Charles Greeley Abbot. Because of Walcott's responsibilities at the Smithsonian, he resigned as director of the United States Geological Survey.[4] As part of the centennial celebration of Darwin's birth, Walcott was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Cambridge in 1909.[8]/nIn 1910, the year after his discovery of 508 million year old (middle Cambrian) fossils in the Burgess shale, Walcott returned to the area accompanied by his sons Stuart and Sidney. Together they examined all the layers on the ridge above the point where the fossil-laden rock had been found, eventually finding the fossiliferous band. Between 1910 and 1924, Walcott returned repeatedly to collect more than 65,000 specimens from what is now known as the Walcott Quarry, named after him. The find includes exceptional preservation of the soft parts of its fossils, one of the oldest fossil beds containing soft-part imprints./nWalcott's wife Helena died in a train crash in Connecticut in 1911. In 1914, Walcott married his third wife, Mary Morris Vaux, an amateur artist and avid naturalist. She accompanied him on his expeditions, enjoying the study of nature. She made watercolor illustrations of wildflowers as she traveled with him in Canada./nAlthough Walcott spent a considerable amount of time at the Burgess Shale quarry on what became known as Fossil Ridge, he also traveled widely in other areas of the Canadian Rockies. Some of his numerous scientific publications feature spectacular panoramic photographs of the mountains taken from high passes or high on mountain slopes./nIn 1914 Walcott convened a conference in Washington, D.C. for the purpose of stimulating interest in aeronautic science, and its relation to the U.S. government. The conference led to an act of congress organizing an Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (later named the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) \"to supervise and direct the scientific study of the problems of flight with a view to their practical solution.\"[9] This committee was composed of twelve members, two each from the Army and Navy, one each representing the Smithsonian Institution, the Weather Bureau, and the National Bureau of Standards. Five additional members were chosen \"who shall be acquainted with the needs of aeronautical science, either civil or military, or skilled in aeronautical engineering or its allied sciences\". Brigadier General George P. Scriven, Chief Signal Officer of the Army, was chairman of the committee; Walcott was elected chairman of the Executive Committee. William F. Durand was one of the civilian members of the Committee.[9]/nIn light of the Wright brothers patent war and to discredit the Wright brothers, Glenn Curtiss in 1914 helped Walcott secretly make major modifications to a failed aerodrome built in 1903 by Professor Samuel Langley to make it appear able to fly. After the flight demonstrations, Walcott ordered the Langley machine be restored to its 1903 condition to cover up the deception before it was put on display.[10][11] It took until 1928 for the Smithsonian Board of Regents to pass a resolution acknowledging that the Wright brothers deserved the credit for \"the first successful flight with a power-propelled heavier-than-air machine carrying a man.\"[12][13]/nAfter Walcott's death in Washington, DC, his samples, photographs, and notes remained in storage until their rediscovery by a new generation of paleontologists in the late 1960s. Since then, many of his interpretations have been revised./nWalcott would be little known today if he had not been brought to attention by Stephen Jay Gould's book Wonderful Life (1989). In this book, Gould put forth his opinion that Walcott failed to see the differences among the Burgess Shale species and \"shoehorned\" most of these fossils into existing phyla. Many paleontologists would now take a much less negative view of Walcott's descriptions and of the theoretical perspective that shaped them.[14]/nWalcott's work on Ordovician trilobites of New York also tended to be overlooked until, in the early 1990s, Rochester-based amateur paleontologist Thomas Whiteley revived Walcott's research and re-opened the Walcott\u2013Rust quarry near Russia, New York.

Only 49 years old, Weintraub left behind a legacy of research.[1][2][3]/nBorn on June 2, 1945, in Newark, New Jersey, Weintraub's childhood revolved around sports, including basketball, an activity he would continue to particularly relish throughout his adult life.  Weintraub was also the pitcher for an all-city high school baseball team, and a football fullback.[4]/nWeintraub attended Harvard College, obtaining his bachelor's degree in 1967.[4] He then proceeded to the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned his M.D. and Ph.D. in 1972.[4] Weintraub performed his Ph.D. dissertation research in the laboratory of Howard Holtzer,[5] studying red blood cell development and production (erythropoeisis) in chicken embryos. This work included the study of cell cycle kinetics, hemoglobin synthesis, and the control of cell division.[6] The effects of bromodeoxyuridine on cell differentiation (conversion of a primitive cell into a more specialized cell) were also analyzed.[7] While still only a graduate student, Weintraub's early work contributed significantly to the fields of developmental and cellular biology, yielding numerous peer-reviewed publications and setting the stage for the next chapter in his research explorations.[1]/nDuring his abbreviated career, Weintraub was the author of more than 130 scientific articles, most of which were in top-tier, peer-reviewed journals, including the \"Big 3\" basic science journals: Cell, Science, and Nature.[8] Weintraub was a member of the National Academy of Sciences,[9] and served as editorial advisor for numerous journals.[4]/nWeintraub spent approximately a year at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, doing a postdoctoral fellowship in the laboratories of Sydney Brenner and Francis Crick.  There, his studies of the nucleosome \u2014 a basic unit of DNA packaging \u2014 showed that its structure was altered when genes were actively transcribed.[1] Weintraub returned to the United States, and between the years 1973\u20131977 was an assistant professor at Princeton University.[10] His research at Princeton, which would continue during his years in Seattle, applied enzymatic and traditional biochemical isolation/separation techniques to clarify the relationship between the physical structure of genes and their expression (the process by which DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA, and eventually into Protein.)[11] Another avenue of research in Weintraub's lab studied the effects of oncoviruses on cellular gene expression.[12]/nIn 1978, Weintraub joined the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), established in 1971 as an independent affiliate of the University of Washington (UW), Seattle.  He was a founding member of the Basic Sciences Division, and professor of genetics at UW.  As described in an essay by Marc Kirschner, one of his former colleagues at Princeton, \"When most of us left [Princeton] in the late 1970s, Hal, typically concerned more with research opportunity than with glamour, went to a young research institution where the practice of science would be paramount.\"[2]  Weintraub remained at \"the Hutch\" (the nickname for FHCRC) until his death in 1995.   In addition, from 1990 to 1995 Weintraub was a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator.[13]/nWhile at FHCRC, Weintraub continued and extended his prior studies of chromatin structure and function.[14][15][16][17] Another of his contributions was developing the technique of using antisense RNA to create specific mutant phenotypes in vertebrate organisms.[18][19] Perhaps the work for which Weintraub is best known was his laboratory's discovery and characterization of \"myoD\", the first master regulatory gene. When expressed, the myoD gene produces a protein referred to as MyoD (or MyoD1), which can bind certain DNA sequences, stop cell division, and elicit an entire program of muscle cell differentiation.  In a series of sequential experiments, Weintraub and his students showed that myoD was able to convert fibroblasts (connective tissue cells) into myoblasts (skeletal muscle cells).[20][21] Later studies by the same group of investigators at FHCRC further characterized the structural and functional characteristics of myoD and its nuclear-localized protein product,[22][23] which were found to be present in organisms as diverse as nematode worms, frogs, mice, and humans.[24] During the final years of his life, Weintraub's work used myoD to delve broadly and deeply into the areas of regulatory proteins, gene expression, and the molecular control of cell differentiation.[25][26][27][28][29][30][31]  As part of this work, his lab pioneered a molecular biology technique known as the Selection And Amplification Binding (SAAB) assay, which is used to find the DNA-binding sites for proteins.[32]/nAlong with chemist Peter Dervan of Caltech and developmental biologist Doug Melton of Harvard, Weintraub was one of three core scientific advisors to Michael L.

He is remembered in genetics for his innovative use of diffusion equations to calculate the probability of fixation of beneficial, deleterious, or neutral alleles.[4] Combining theoretical population genetics with molecular evolution data, he also developed the neutral theory of molecular evolution in which genetic drift is the main force changing allele frequencies.[5] James F. Crow, himself a renowned population geneticist, considered Kimura to be one of the two greatest evolutionary geneticists, along with Gustave Mal\u00e9cot, after the great trio of the modern synthesis, Ronald Fisher, J. B. S. Haldane, and Sewall Wright.[6]/nKimura was born on November 13, 1924, in Okazaki, Aichi Prefecture.[7] From an early age he was very interested in botany, though he also excelled at mathematics (teaching himself geometry and other maths during a lengthy convalescence due to food poisoning). After entering a selective high school in Nagoya, Kimura focused on plant morphology and cytology; he worked in the laboratory of M. Kumazawa studying the chromosome structure of lilies. With Kumazawa, he also discovered how to connect his interests in botany and mathematics: biometry.[1]/nDue to World War II, Kimura left high school early to enter Kyoto Imperial University in 1944. On the advice of the prominent geneticist Hitoshi Kihara, Kimura entered the botany program rather than cytology because the former, in the Faculty of Science rather than Agriculture, allowed him to avoid military duty. He joined Kihara's laboratory after the war, where he studied the introduction of foreign chromosomes into plants and learned the foundations of population genetics.[7][1]/nIn 1949, Kimura joined the National Institute of Genetics in Mishima, Shizuoka. In 1953 he published his first population genetics paper (which would eventually be very influential), describing a \"stepping stone\" model for population structure that could treat more complex patterns of migration than Sewall Wright's earlier \"island model\". After meeting visiting American geneticist Duncan McDonald (part of the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission), Kimura arranged to enter graduate school at Iowa State College in the summer 1953 to study with J. L. Lush.[1]/nKimura soon found Iowa State College too restricting; he moved to the University of Wisconsin to work on stochastic models with James F. Crow and to join a strong intellectual community of like-minded geneticists, including Newton Morton and most significantly, Sewall Wright. Near the end of his graduate study, Kimura gave a paper at the 1955 Cold Spring Harbor Symposium; though few were able to understand it (both because of mathematical complexity and Kimura's English pronunciation) it received strong praise from Wright and later J.B.S. Haldane.[1][7]/nHis accomplishments at Wisconsin included a general model for genetic drift, which could accommodate multiple alleles, selection, migration, and mutations, as well as some work based on R.A. Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection. He also built on the work of Wright with the Fokker\u2013Planck equation by introducing the Kolmogorov backward equation to population genetics, allowing the calculation of the probability of an allele to become fixed in a population.[8] He received his PhD in 1956, before returning to Japan (where he would remain for the rest of his life, at the National Institute of Genetics).[1]/nKimura worked on a wide spectrum of theoretical population genetics problems, many of them in collaboration with Takeo Maruyama. He introduced the \"infinite alleles\", \"infinite sites\", and \"stepwise[9]\" models of mutation, all of which would be used widely as the field of molecular evolution grew alongside the number of available peptide and genetic sequences. The stepwise mutation model is a \"ladder model\" that can be applied to electrophoresis studies where homologous proteins differ by whole units of charge. An early statement of his approach was published in 1960, in his An Introduction to Population Genetics.[10] He also contributed an important review article on the ongoing controversy over genetic load in 1961.[1][11]/n1968 marked a turning point in Kimura's career. In that year he introduced the neutral theory of molecular evolution, the idea that, at the molecular level, the large majority of genetic change is neutral with respect to natural selection\u2014making genetic drift a primary factor in evolution.[12][13] The field of molecular biology was expanding rapidly, and there was growing tension between advocates of the expanding reductionist field and scientists in organismal biology, the traditional domain of evolution. The neutral theory was immediately controversial, receiving support from many molecular biologists and attracting opposition from many evolutionary biologists.[14][12]/nKimura spent the rest of his life developing and defending the neutral theory. As James Crow put it, \"much of Kimura's early work turned out to be pre-adapted for use in the quantitative study of neutral evolution\".[1] As new experimental techniques and genetic knowledge became available, Kimura expanded the scope of the neutral theory and created mathematical methods for testing it against the available evidence.[14] Kimura produced a monograph on the neutral theory in 1983, The Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution, and also worked to promote the theory through popular writings such as My Views on Evolution, a book that became a best-seller in Japan.[15]/nThough difficult to test against alternative selection-centered hypotheses, the neutral theory has become part of modern approaches to molecular evolution.[16][17]/nIn 1992, Kimura received the Darwin Medal from the Royal Society, and the following year he was made a Foreign Member of the Royal Society.[1]/nKimura suffered from progressive weakening caused by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis later in life.[6] In an accidental fall at his home in Shizuoka, Japan, Kimura struck his head and died on November 13, 1994, of a cerebral hemorrhage.[7][18][6] He was married to Hiroko Kimura. They had one child, a son, Akio, and a granddaughter, Hanako.[19][20]", "44521687": "Irwin William Sherman (February 12, 1933 - January 5, 2022) was a biology professor emeritus.

Influenced by his professors (James Dawson, William Tavolga, and Herman Spieth particularly) Sherman pursued a graduate degree at University of Florida under the tutelage of W.C. Allee. Sherman's studies were interrupted when he was drafted into the Army as a medical technician. After training at Fort Dix, Fort Sam Houston, and Valley Forge Army Hospital he was sent to overseas to work in army laboratories in Austria and Germany. Upon completion of his military service Sherman chose to teach high school in Yonkers rather than return to graduate school in Florida.

Cann and Mark Stoneking).[2][3]/nAllan Wilson was born in Ng\u0101ruaw\u0101hia, New Zealand, and raised on his family's rural dairy farm at Helvetia, Pukekohe, about twenty miles south of Auckland. At his local Sunday School, the vicar's wife was impressed by young Allan's interest in evolution and encouraged Allan's mother to enroll him at the elite King's College secondary school in Auckland.  There he excelled in mathematics, chemistry, and sports.  Wilson already had an interest in evolution and biochemistry, but intended to be the first in his family to attend university by pursuing studies in agriculture and animal science.  Wilson met Professor Campbell Percy McMeekan, a New Zealand pioneer in animal science, who suggested that Wilson attend the University of Otago in southern New Zealand to further his study in biochemistry rather than veterinary science.[4] Wilson gained a BSc from the University of Otago in 1955, majoring in both zoology and biochemistry. The bird physiologist Donald S. Farner met Wilson as an undergraduate at Otago and invited him to Washington State University at Pullman as his graduate student. Wilson obliged and completed a master's degree in zoology at WSU under Farner in 1957, where he worked on the effects of photoperiod on the physiology of birds.[5][6]/nWilson then moved to the University of California, Berkeley, to pursue his doctoral research. At the time the family thought Allan would only be gone two years. Instead, Wilson remained in the United States, gaining his PhD at Berkeley in 1961 under the direction of biochemist Arthur Pardee for work on the regulation of flavin biosynthesis in bacteria.[7] From 1961 to 1964, Wilson studied as a post-doc under biochemist Nathan O. Kaplan at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts.[8] In Kaplan's lab, working with lactate and malate dehydrogenases,[9] Wilson was first introduced to the nascent field of molecular evolution.[10][11][12]  Nate Kaplan was one of the very earliest pioneers to address phylogenetic problems with evidence from protein molecules,[13][14] an approach that Wilson later famously applied to human evolution and primate relationships. After Brandeis, Wilson returned to Berkeley where he set up his own lab in the Biochemistry department, remaining there for the rest of his life.[5][15]/nWilson joined the UC Berkeley faculty of biochemistry in 1964, and was promoted to full professor in 1972.[8] His first major scientific contribution was published as Immunological Time-Scale For Hominid Evolution in the journal Science in December 1967.[16] With his student Vincent Sarich,[17][18] he showed that evolutionary relationships of the human species with other primates, in particular the great apes (humans, chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans), could be inferred from molecular evidence obtained from living species, rather than solely from fossils of extinct creatures. Their microcomplement fixation method (see complement system) measured the strength of the immune reaction between an antigen (serum albumin) from one species and an antibody raised against the same antigen in another species. The strength of the antibody-antigen reaction was known to be stronger between more closely related species: their innovation was to measure it quantitatively among many species pairs as an \"immunological distance\". When these distances were plotted against the divergence times of species pair with well-established evolutionary histories, the data showed that the molecular difference increased linearly with time, in what was termed a \"molecular clock\". Given this calibration curve, the time of divergence between species pairs with unknown or uncertain fossil histories could be inferred. Most controversially, their data suggested that divergence times between humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas were on the order of 3~5\u00a0million years, far less than the estimates of 9~30\u00a0million years accepted by conventional paleoanthropologists from fossil hominids such as Ramapithecus. This 'recent origin' theory of human/ape divergence remained controversial until the discovery of the \"Lucy\" fossils, in 1974, definitively dated in 1992 as between 3.22 and 3.18 million years.[19]/nWilson and another PhD student Mary-Claire King subsequently compared several lines of genetic evidence (immunology, amino acid differences, and protein electrophoresis) on the divergence of humans and chimpanzees, and showed that all methods agreed that the two species were >99% similar.[4][20] Given the large organismal differences between the two species in the absence of large genetic differences, King and Wilson proposed that it was not structural gene differences that were responsible for species differences, but gene regulation of those differences, that is, the timing and manner in which near-identical gene products are assembled during embryology and development. In combination with the \"molecular clock\" hypothesis, this contrasted sharply with the accepted view that larger or smaller organismal differences were due to large or smaller amounts of genetic divergence./nIn the early 1980s, Wilson further disturbed and refined traditional anthropological thinking by his work with PhD students Rebecca Cann and Mark Stoneking on the so-called \"Mitochondrial Eve\" hypothesis.[21] In his efforts to identify informative genetic markers for tracking human evolutionary history, he focused on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) \u2013 genes that are found in mitochondria organelles in the cytoplasm of the cell outside the nucleus. Because of its location in the cytoplasm, mtDNA is passed exclusively from mother to child, the father making no contribution, and in the absence of genetic recombination defines female lineages over evolutionary timescales. Because it also mutates rapidly, it is possible to measure the small genetic differences among individual within species and between closely related species by restriction endonuclease gene mapping. Wilson, Cann, and Stoneking measured differences among many individuals from different human continental groups, and found that humans from Africa showed the greatest inter-individual differences, consistent with an African origin of the human species (the Recent African origin of modern humans or \"Out of Africa\" hypothesis). The data further indicated that all living humans shared a common maternal ancestor, who lived in Africa only a few hundreds of thousands of years ago. This common ancestor became widely known in the media and popular culture as the Mitochondrial Eve. This had the unfortunate and erroneous implication that only a single female lived at that time, when in fact the occurrence of a coalescent ancestor is a necessary consequence of population genetic theory, and the Mitochondrial Eve would have been only one of many humans (male and female) alive at that time.[2][3] This finding was, like his earlier results, not readily accepted by anthropologists. The conventional hypothesis had been that various human continental groups had evolved from diverse ancestors, over several millions of years since divergence from chimpanzees. The mtDNA data, however, strongly support the alternative and now generally accepted hypothesis, that all humans descend relatively recently from a common, relatively small African population.[4][15]/nWilson became ill with leukaemia, and after a bone marrow transplant, died on Sunday, 21 July 1991, at the Fred Hutchinson Memorial Cancer Research Center in Seattle. He had been scheduled to give the keynote address at an international conference the same day. He was 56, at the height of his scientific recognition and powers.[3][5][22] He was survived by his wife, Leona Wilson (died in 2009), and two children, Ruth (1961-2014), of East Lansing, Michigan, and David (born 1964), of San Francisco.[1][8]/nWilson's success can be attributed to his strong interest and depth of knowledge in biochemistry and evolutionary biology, his insistence of quantification of evolutionary phenomena, and his early recognition of new molecular techniques that could shed light on questions of evolutionary biology. After development of quantitative immunological methods, his lab was the first to recognise restriction endonuclease mapping analysis as a quantitative evolutionary genetic method, which led to his early use of DNA sequencing, and the then-nascent technique of PCR to obtain large DNA sets for genetic analysis of populations. He trained scores of undergraduate, graduate (17 women and 17 men received their doctoral degrees in his lab), and post-doctoral students in molecular evolutionary biology, including sabbatical visitors from six continents. His lab published more than 300 technical papers, and was recognised in the 1970s ~ 80s as the mecca for those wishing to enter the field of molecular evolution.[6]/nThe Allan Wilson Centre for Molecular Ecology and Evolution was established in 2002 in his honour to advance knowledge of the evolution and ecology of New Zealand and Pacific plant and animal life, and human history in the Pacific. The Centre was under the Massey University, at Palmerston North, New Zealand, as a national collaboration among the University of Auckland, Victoria University of Wellington, the University of Otago, University of Canterbury, and the New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research.[23] The Centre closed at the end of 2015 when the Government stopped funding it.[24]/nA 41-minute documentary film of his life entitled Allan Wilson, Evolutionary: Biochemist, Biologist, Giant of Molecular Biology was released by Films Media Group in 2008.[25]", "53270758": "Nuggehalli Raghuveer Moudgal (4 March 1931 \u2013 8 May 2011) was an Indian reproductive biologist, endocrinologist and the chairman of the Department of Biochemistry and dean of Faculty of Science at the Indian Institute of Science. He was known for his pioneering researches on gonadotropin and was an elected fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences and the Indian National Science Academy. He was an associate of noted scientists, Choh Hao Li and Rodney Robert Porter and discovered the role of hormones in generating immune response in living beings, during his association with the former. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards for his contributions to Medical Sciences in 1976./nRaghuveer Moudgal was born on 4 March 1931[1] in Mysore, in the south Indian state of Karnataka, in a Hindu family to Vaidehi, a homemaker and N. Narasimha Moudgal, an electrical engineer with the State Electricity Board who reportedly contributed significantly to the electrification of the erstwhile Mysore state.[2] He was the youngest of their three boys and two girls.[note 1] His early schooling was at Seshadripuram High School, Bengaluru where he passed the matriculation in 1946.  He moved to Kolhapur to complete his graduate studies at the University of Bombay in 1950, staying at his elder sister's house.[3] Opting for a research degree for his post graduate studies, he joined the University of Madras and earned an MSc for his researches on the biochemistry of thyroid hormones. Continuing in Chennai,[note 2] he pursued his doctoral studies under the guidance of P. S. Sarma, a noted biochemist, and secured a PhD in 1957. He went to the University of California, Berkeley in the US for his post-doctoral studies and worked as a post-doctoral fellow at the laboratory of Choh Hao Li, a Chinese-born US biochemist who would later describe the structure of somatotropin, a pituitary growth hormone.[4]/nIn 1961, he moved out of the US to continue his post-doctoral work in the UK at St Mary's Hospital Medical School, London on a Wellcome Trust fellowship.[5] There, he joined the wards of Rodney Robert Porter, Nobel laureate biochemist,[note 3] and spent a year at Porter's laboratory. On his return to India, he joined the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi as a CSIR Pool Officer. It was during this period his doctoral adviser, P. S. Sarma, invited him to join the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) as an assistant professor. At IISc, he continued his researches with the assistance of a grant from Ford Foundation and in 1969 he received an invitation from R. O. Greep of Harvard University for collaborative research.[7] Moudgal stayed at Harvard for two years to supervise the work of Greep's Group and returned to IISc in 1971. He based his subsequent researches at the institute, simultaneously working as an associate professor and later as a professor. At the time of his retirement from official service in 1993, he was holding the positions of the Chairman of the Department of Biochemistry and the Dean of the Science Faculty.[2] Post retirement, he continued to be associated with IISc as an INSA senior scientist and an honorary professor.[8][9]/nMoudgal was pursuing his doctoral studies at Madras University when he married Biligiri Rao n\u00e9e Prapulla in 1957.[3] The couple had two sons, Pradeep and Madan, and a daughter, Priya.

He succumbed to the disease on 8 May 2011, at a hospital in Dublin, California, survived by his children, their spouses and grandchildren; his wife predeceased him in 2008.[2]/nMoudgal's early researches at the University of Madras were on the biochemistry of thyroid hormones but he shifted his focus to pituitary gonadotropins during his days at Choh Hao Li's laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley when he established that the hormones generated immune response in living beings and the discovery was reported to be a significant one as the belief till then was the principal function of the hormones was reproduction.[7] Later, at Rodney Porter's laboratory in London, he worked on the role of cellulose as a carrier for immobilization of antibodies. Back in India, he expanded the scope of his researches to cover wider aspects of reproductive biology for which he established a Primate Research Laboratory at IISc in 1965, which was the largest primate house in the country at that time.[8][2] Working on the macaques in his primate house, he discovered that sialidase from the kidney of the primate acted as an inhibitor of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), a hormone responsible for pubertal development.[2] He conducted elaborate studies on the molecular mechanism of Luteinizing Hormone (LH), a hormone which has significant role in ovulation and testosterone production, and elucidated the unfolding of LH binding to LH receptors in the target cell[10][11] which was detailed in one of his articles, Effect of ICSH on Early Pregnancy in Hypophysectomized Pregnant Rats, published in Nature in 1969.[12] He discovered that neutralizing LH resulted in neutralization of several reproductive functions such as ovulation, implantation, and gestational progress and the discovery opened a new methodology in immunocontraceptive technology.[3] Later, he furthered his investigations on hormone actions by using antibodies as probes. His findings reportedly prompted R. O. Greep of Harvard University to invite him for collaborative research and Moudgal supervised the work of Greep's Group at his laboratory. At Harvard, he also collaborated with W. R. Moyle and established the presence of Luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptors on tumor cells in the testicles for the first time, which they revealed in an article, Specific binding of luteinizing hormone to Leydig tumor cells, published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry in 1971.[13] He used these tumor cells for further investigations on Hormone-Receptor interactions, Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) production and steroidogenesis and experimentally demonstrated the extent of coupling and response with regard to cyclic AMP production and steroid output.[3][note 4]/nBonnet macaques raised by him at Primate Research Laboratory[note 5] made it handy for Moudgal in carrying out researches on follicle stimulating hormone in the primates and he discovered that immuno-neutralization of circulating FSH decreases the semen count, leading to oligozoospermia or azoospermia, but did not adversely affect libido.[3] He successfully replicated the experiments in rodents as well and suggested FSH as an immunocontraceptive protocol.[15] However, the researches could not be furthered due to laws related to preparation of protein-based pharmaceuticals. Still, his studies widened the understanding of conditions such as follicular maturation, atresia, spermatogenesis, primate reproduction and lactational amenorrhea. The pioneering work carried out by him led to the Indian Council of Medical Research recognizing his laboratory at IISc as a Centre for Advanced Research in Reproductive Biology, which as since been upgraded as Department of Molecular Reproduction and Developmental Genetics (MRDG).[7][16] He documented his researches by way of several articles[17][note 6] and his work has been cited by a number of authors and researchers.[18][19][20][21] Besides, he edited two books, Gonadotropins and Gonadal Function[22] and Perspectives In Primate Reproductive Biology[23] and contributed chapters to many texts edited by others.[24][25][26] He presented a research paper, Gonadotropins and Their Antibodies,[27] at the Laurentian Hormone Research Conference (LHRC) held at Mont Tremblant, Canada in August 1973,[28] thus becoming the first Indian scientist to present a paper at LHRC.[2][7][5] He also guided over 30 doctoral and post-doctoral scholars in their studies and two of them, Addicam Jagannadha Rao and Appaji Rao, are emeritus professors of IISc.[29] His niece, Mrinalini Rao, whom he mentored, is a distinguished scientist at the University of Illinois.[3][30]/nMoudgal, who was the secretary of the Society of Biological Chemists (India) from 1967 to 1969,[31] served as the secretary-general of the Federation of Asian and Oceanian Biochemists (FAOB) during 1972\u201375[32] and was a member of the Endocrine Society and the Society for the study of Reproduction, both US-based societies.[2] He was one of the founders of the Indian Society for the Study of Reproduction and Fertility and served as its first president.[7] He organized an International Symposium on gonadotropins which was attended by some of the major names in the field of reproductive biology including Malur R. Narasimha Prasad, Gursaran Talwar, Sardul Singh Guraya, Fernand Labrie and Om P. Bahl.[3] He was a member of the task force of the World Health Organization for research in human reproduction for a number of years,[15] sat in the editorial board of Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology and was the founding editor of Journal of Biosciences.[7] He also served as the editor of Frontiers in Bioscience.[33]/nMoudgal received the B. C. Guha Award in 1975,[8] the same year as he was elected as a fellow by the Indian Academy of Sciences.[34] The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research awarded him Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards in 1976.[35] He received the Sreenivasaya Memorial Award from the Society of Biological Chemists (India) of the Indian Institute of Science in 1978[36] and he was selected for the Homi Bhabha Fellowship of the Homi Bhabha Foundation the same year.[37] The Indian National Science Academy elected him as their fellow in 1979[38] and he received the Sanjay Gandhi Award for Science and Technology in 1984.[2] The award orations delivered by him include the 1996 Yellapragada Subbarow Birth Centenary Lecture of the Indian National Science Academy.[39] The Indian Society for the Study of Reproduction and Fertility has instituted an annual oration, Prof. N. R. Moudgal Memorial Oration and an award, Prof. N. R. Moudgal Young Scientist Awards in his honor.[40] His biography has been included in the volume 40 of the Biographical memoirs of fellows of the Indian National Science Academy.[41]", "50387175": "Amanda \"Mandy\" Louise Reid is an Australian taxonomist and malacologist.

In 1883, he moved to Tokyo, where he entered the preparatory school Ky\u014dry\u016b Gakk\u014d. The headmaster of Ky\u014dritsu, Takahashi Korekiyo, encouraged Minakata in his botanical studies, and stimulated his interest in the English language. The following year, Minakata passed the entrance exam to Tokyo University Preparatory School (Tokyo Daigaku Yobimon), counting among his classmates the novelist Natsume S\u014dseki./nAt the end of 1886, Minakata set off to study in the United States. He arrived in San Francisco in January of the next year, and he studied there for about six months. He next went to Michigan State Agricultural College, where he was accepted, becoming the first Japanese to pass the entrance exam there. These were just the first steps, however, in Minakata's unusually adventurous studies in various parts of the world, which would eventually include Cuba, Haiti, what is now Panama, Venezuela, and England, before returning to Japan./nIn addition to his studies in slime moulds, Minakata was intensely interested in folklore, religion and natural history. He wrote several papers, including 51 monographs in Nature. He is famous for discovering many varieties of mycetozoa./nMinakata had epilepsy, experiencing grand mal seizures. He was able to predict when he was about to have a seizure (as is common in epilepsy) due to a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu./nMinakata Kumagusu came back to Japan in 1900 after 14 years of unique study experience abroad mainly in the U.S. and England. He settled in Wakayama Prefecture, his birthplace, until his death in 1941. He lived in Tanabe City from 1904 to 1941. Minakata devoted his entire life to studies of natural history and folklore, and contributed a number of articles to the British science magazine Nature and the British folklore magazine Notes and Queries. He was also involved in anti-shrine-consolidation protests and the nature conservation movement in Japan. He was worshipped as \"a great scholar with no degree\" and loved by the locals who called him Minakata Sensei (the teacher) or Minakata-san (Mr. Minakata), while branded by some[who?] as an oddball. More than 60 years after his death, Minakata's achievements and life history has been made clear by a number of books and papers including The Complete Works of Minakata Kumagusu and The Diary of Minakata Kumagusu, and the research is still ongoing./nMinakata Kumagusu was born in the castle city of Wakayama on April 15, 1867, the second son to a hardware dealer Yahei Minakata, 39, and wife Sumi, 30, and was raised with three brothers and two sisters. Since childhood, he had had extraordinary interests in the natural world and demonstrated a marvelous memory. As early as at the age of seven he transcribed an encyclopedia./nTo develop his talent, Yahei, a self-made man, sent Minakata to the newly opened Wakayama Middle School (now Toin High), which was unconventional for a merchant family those days. Minakata's thirst for knowledge was growing bigger as he at home recited the Chinese classics and transcribed the books that he had learned by heart at a collector's place. That he transcribed Wakan Sansai Zue, an encyclopedia of 105 volumes, and Honzo Komoku, illustrated books of flora, in over five years is a famous episode from this period. At school, however, he remained a low achiever. He would finish lunch early and observe a frog or a crab in the empty lunch box./nAfter finishing middle school, he went to Tokyo in March 1883. The following year he entered the Preparatory School of Tokyo University. Among his colleagues were Masaoka Shiki, Natsume S\u014dseki, and Bimyo Yamada, who later became eminent figures of Japanese literature. Again Minakata was not interested in school and spent more time outside the university transcribing books in libraries, visiting zoos and botanic gardens, and collecting artifacts, animals, plants and minerals. At the news that Miles J. Berkeley, a world-famous British cryptogamist, and American botanist Moses A. Curtis had collected 6,000 species of fungi including slime molds, Minakata decided to produce an illustrated book that would cover more. In February 1886, following a failure at the end-of-year exam, he came home and told father that he would go to America. Initially opposed, Yahei finally gave in to his son's enthusiasm and let him go./nMinakata boarded the City of Beijing in Yokohama in December 1886. The next month the ship arrived in San Francisco, and he soon started to study at Pacific Business College just to experience American life (business was not his favorite subject)./nIn August 1887, he moved to Lansing, Michigan, and enrolled at the Michigan State School of Agriculture. One night in November 1888, however, he was in trouble for a drinking binge with a couple of Japanese and American friends in the dorm. He took the responsibility alone to save others from expulsion and early next morning left for Ann Arbor./nMinakata met bright Japanese students in Ann Arbor, the location of another state university. While keeping company with them, he stayed away from university and studied on his own by reading books and collecting plants in the mountains, particularly cryptogams including fungi and lichens. In October 1889, he read a biography of Conrad Gessner, a Swiss naturalist and a leading figure of modern biology, and swore he would become Japan's Gessner, which was when his quest for the wonders of cryptogams began./nWhen he heard from William W. Calkins, a retired American colonel and a collector of lichens, that in Florida there were still many undiscovered plants, Minakata was ready to go. With two microscopes, books, a pistol, insect catchers as well as a medicine box and a plant press that he had just bought in Ann Arbor, Minakata went to Jacksonville in April 1891. He collected plants and animals while staying with Jiang, a supportive Chinese vegetable storekeeper. After three months enthusiastically collecting plants and animals, he moved to Key West, Florida, then to Havana, Cuba in mid-September./nAfter a month in Havana, a Japanese circus rider suddenly visited him. That encounter brought him to a new adventure of traveling in Port-au-Prince, Caracas, Valencia, and Jamaica with the circus working as a mahout's hand. This enabled him to collect precious fungi and lichens in the West Indies. In January 1892 he returned to Jacksonville and worked on the plants he had collected in Florida and Cuba at Jiang's. When Jiang wound up the business in August, Minakata moved to New York. In September he put an end to six years in America and got aboard the City of New York bound for the UK./nAfter crossing the Atlantic Ocean, the ship arrived at Liverpool. In London, Minakata visited Yoshikusu Nakai, branch manager of the Yokohama Shokin Bank, an old friend of the Minakata family from Wakayama. The man handed him a letter from Tsunegusu, one of his younger brothers, about their beloved father's death. Minakata was totally devastated./nHe lived in downtown London where rents were cheap. While working on herbaria and exchanging specimens and letters with William W. Calkins and Allen, he visited the British Museum, the South Kensington Museum and other galleries. He then was introduced to Japanese Asian antique dealer Kataoka Prince. In August 1893, Minakata read in Nature magazine, his favorite since his time in U.S., a thesis titled \"Five articles about the composition of constellations.\" Its questions inspired him to write a reply./nKataoka Prince, who had noticed the erudition of the shabby-looking man, introduced him to Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks, of the British Museum. Thereafter, Minakata visited the museum often to ask advice from Franks. Using a fragmented dictionary borrowed from his landlady, he completed an article titled \"The Constellations in the Far East\" in 30 days. The article was published in Nature, and he suddenly became known among the intelligentsia. He contributed regularly to the magazine after that and also started writing for Notes and Queries. He continued to contribute a number of articles and letters to the magazines after returning to Japan and won a reputation worldwide as an authority on Oriental studies./nHis rising reputation opened the door to friendships with notable figures including Frederick. V. Dickins, registrar of the University of London, as well as people from the British Museum including Sir Robert K. Douglas, director of the Oriental Printed Books section and Charles H. Read, the successor to Franks. He visited the British Museum almost every day. While immersing himself in rare books of all ages from East and West, particularly in the fields of archeology, anthropology, folklore and religion, he copied them into notebooks. A collection of 52 thick notebooks from this period called London Extracts is kept in the Minakata residence and the Minakata Kumagusu Museum. The pages are densely covered with tiny letters he put in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Greek and Latin./nDouglas, who was impressed with his extensive knowledge, offered Minakata a job at the British Museum, but he declined the offer in light of freedom. Instead, he helped make a catalog of the books and manuscripts of the library and conducted historical research on the Buddhist statues of the museum using his expertise accumulated through reading and transcribing of a large number of books including classics and encyclopedia since childhood./nOne of the highlights in London was getting to know Sun Yat-sen, father of the Chinese Revolution. Minakata put it in his diary how they hit it off straight away on first acquaintance at the Douglas's office in the British Museum in March 1897 and quickly developed a friendship through visiting each other and talking until late almost every day. The descriptions, though very brief, reveal the closeness between two friends. Their company lasted only four months until Sun had to leave London for Asia in early July./nIn October 1893 he met Toki Horyu, later the chief abbot of K\u014dyasan temple complex, a relationship that deserves special mention. Minakata and Toki, much senior to him, opened up to each other and exchanged frank opinions about religion. They wrote to each other until later years./nMany famous figures from Japan visited Minakata in London. They all were astonished at his erudition and shocked at his total lack of interest in daily life. Although highly regarded by some scholars, Minakata sometimes experienced discrimination because of his ethnicity, the cause for his frequent reckless behaviors leading up to the departure from the British Museum in December 1898. Frequent delay of money expected from the family in Japan forced him to take a job translating the titles for the calligraphy collection at the South Kensington Museum and sell ukiyoe with his friends. High hopes of becoming an assistant professor at the soon-to-be opened Japanology program in Cambridge or Oxford were gone when the plan was turned down. Forced into straitened circumstances, he made a decision in despair to leave the UK, where he had spent eight years. In September 1900, Minakata got on board the Awa Maru at the Thames and went home./nIn October 1900, the Awa Maru arrived at Kobe after a 45-day voyage. Tsunegusu was shocked to see his elder brother appear in a shabby suit made of flimsy fabric like mosquito netting. He also was astounded Minakata had come back with tons of books and specimens but no degree. Minakata found temporary shelter at his brother's in Wakayama./nAfter a while, Minakata heard that Sun Yat-sen was in the Yokohama settlement as a political refugee and wrote him. In February 1901 Sun came to Wakayama. Although the first reunion in four years was disturbed by a police detail, Sun was happy to take risks to see his old friend. As a gift, Sun left his favorite Panama hat. He later sent Minakata a reference letter addressed to Inukai Tsuyoshi, his guardian in Japan and later the prime minister. The letter, never used, is kept in the Minakata residence and the hat is on display in the Minakata Kumagusu Museum. Their friendship survived for a while; Sun sent specimens of lichen from Hawaii and Minakata wrote back, but ultimately they drifted apart and never met again. After Sun's death, Minakata expressed his sorrow in the reminiscence and wrote: \"Friendship changes like seasons.\"/nIn October 1901 Minakata left Wakayama by boat for Katsu\u2019ura, where he lived at the branch of Minakata Sake Distillery, run by brother Tsunegusu, until October 1904. In Nachi he spent all his time collecting fungi and algae around the region. One day, while collecting lichen at the Ichino-taki Falls, he met a young man, Shiro Koaze, a shipping company worker. Koaze, as a disciple, was going to help Minakata with research on slime molds all his life. Koaze sent specimens from every port he called as well as offered financial support. Koaze, with his close friend Shigeru Uematsu, backed Minakata materially and spiritually./nMinakata was very active in Nachi. He collected insects and plants, made microscope slides and colored illustrated manuals, read hundreds of books, completed a draft for the English translation of Hojoki: The Ten Square Feet Hut co-authored with Frederick Victor Dickins, and proofread  Primal Text of Japan also by Dickins. He resumed writing for Nature and Notes and Queries. Embraced by the wildlife in the Kumano Mountains, Minakata, based on his extensive knowledge of the world, studied interaction between the spiritual with the material world, and participated in heated debates on nature and life, including religious one with Horyu Toki. He also completed The Origin of the Swallow-Stone Myth (Ensekiko), a study he had planned at the end of the time in UK, that is considered the pinnacle of his research presented in English./nAfter three years and 21 months research on plants in the Kumano region, Kumagusu left Katsu'ura in October 1904 and walked to Tanabe, collecting specimens on his way. On arrival he immediately fell in love with Tanabe he thought was \u201ca quiet place with nice people, cheap commodities and beautiful weather and the scenery.\u201d[citation needed] He decided to settle, rented a house and started an easy life. He often invited friends and had parties at nearby luxury restaurants and teahouses; hired geishas, drank, sang Dodoitsu and Otsue, his favorite party pieces, and played strange performances./nIn the fall of 1905 Minakata donated 46 specimens of slime molds to the British Museum. Arthur Lister, president of the British Mycological Society, had them introduced in the Journal of Botany, vol. 49, as \"The Second Report of Japanese Fungi,\" following the first report on the specimens sent by Prof. Miyoshi of Tokyo Imperial University. This article, which led Minakata to a new world of friendship with Lister and his daughter Gulielma, was a milestone in his career toward a world-class slime mold researcher./nIn July 1906 at 40 Minakata married Matsue, 28, the fourth daughter of Munezo Tamura, chief priest of the Tokei Shrine. Tamura, a former samurai of the Kishu-Tokugawa clan, was also a Sinologist whose knowledge of Chinese wisdom had influenced Matsue's upbringing. Her late marriage (for a woman in those days) was due to her devotion to father and the destitute family she had supported by teaching sewing and flower arrangement./nIn July 1907 the couple had their first child, Kumaya. At first sight of his baby boy Minakata wrote: \u201cStayed awake till dawn watching my baby\u201d[citation needed] and expressed the joy of becoming father. After the birth of Kumaya the marriage was rocky. After Matsue turned to her parents a few times, he gradually reduced alcohol. He kept in his diary every detail of Kumaya, how he moved and talked, which shows his deep love and expectations for his son. Minakata usually woke at 11 am and worked at home from sometime in the afternoon until 5 o\u2019clock next morning sorting specimens, drawing pictures, conducting research, reading and writing. While weaving, Matsue, together with a housemaid, was very nervous about the care of weepy Kumaya. Their daughter Fumie was born in October 1911./nMinakata resumed copying books around in 1909. The extract of Daizokyo, scriptures owned by the H\u014drin-ji Temple, which took full three years, was a particularly demanding job. \u201cTo read is to copy. You\u2019ll forget when you just read it, but you\u2019ll never forget when you copy it.\u201d[citation needed] He propagated this belief and put it into practice by himself. The Tanabe Extracts from this period consist of 61 volumes. On top of the contributions he had made to British journals and magazines since coming home, Minakata started writing for journals and newspapers in Japan. Using a lot of citations was his signature style of research papers, but first-hand folklore evidence and antiquities were also included. He used his extraordinary memory and archives accumulated through interviews./nIn 1906 the government imposed shrine consolidation regulations under which all shrines in a village or a town should be merged. The Wakayama prefectural government pushed hard for the enforcement of the regulations. In Japan there used to be a shrine in each community, however small, which was the centripetal force to unite the people, the provider of recreations and the object of worship, and with very few exceptions, they all stood in deep forests./nMinakata was worried that the consolidations would not only ruin historical buildings and antiquities but, by cutting trees, also damage the scenery and the natural life around them.[citation needed] He contributed an opinion to every edition of a local paper, Muro Shinpo. He also sent objection letters to major papers in Tokyo and Osaka and appealed to leading researchers for support, including Jinzo Matsumura, a notable botanist and professor of Tokyo University, to whom Minakata wrote long letters criticizing the deeds done by the central and prefectural governments. Yanagita Kunio, then a counselor of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau and later father of Japanese folklore, supported the campaign by disseminating copies of two letters as Minakata Nisho to those who concerned. He was also supported locally by a young Morihei Ueshiba.[1]/nIn August 1910 Minakata was arrested for trespassing when he threw a bag of specimens into a meeting held in Tanabe Junior High School (now Tanabe High). Although drunk, he did it out of rage when not allowed to talk with one of the attendees, a government officer who was in charge of the promotion of the regulations.[citation needed] During 18 days in jail pending trial he read books and hunted slime molds in the building. When released, he refused to leave saying: \u201cThis place is quiet with no visitors and cool. I want to stay longer.\u201d[citation needed]/nAs his enthusiasm moved public opinion, the regulations gradually lost momentum. In 1920, 10 years from his arrest, the regulations were confirmed useless by the House of Peers and abolished. Ultimately, Minakata's efforts saved a couple of forests, but a number of shrines and forests had become extinct during the decade. He then approached various social movements and public bodies in charge of the national heritage list in order to promote protection of the precious environment including the Kashima Island in Tanabe Bay. His battle continued until his last years, which is why he is called a pioneer in ecology today.[by whom?] In February 1911, when The Mountain God Loves Stonefish was published in the Journal of the Anthropological Society of Tokyo, Minakata received a letter from Yanagita. This was when their correspondence between two (which was going to make a significant contribution to the study of Japanese folklore) began./nIn July 1914 Kumagusu's reputation was spread nationwide, following a newspaper report on the announcement by Walter T. Swingle, head of the Office of Crop Physiology and Breeding investigation of US Department of Agriculture, that they would invite Minakata to the US. Dr. Swingle came to Tanabe in May 1915 to announce the appointment in person. Although having intended to accept the offer, he declined it because of a family matter./nIn April 1916, Minakata obtained a property, now the Minakata residence, under the ownership of Tsunegusu. The large garden became an open-air laboratory to observe plants, frogs, and turtles. The study was a place for writing and microscopic research on plants. The godown was organized into the stacks containing a number of books and materials./nHe published numerous research papers about folklore based on previous research papers of natural science already published and articles about shrine consolidation. The more scholars and celebrities he received and the busier he became with his writing, the more often he had to stay home and conduct his botanical research in the backyard. This change enabled him to discover the famous Minakatella longifila Lister \u2014 a new genus of slime mold named by Gulielma Lister, president of the British Mycological Society \u2014 from a persimmon tree in his garden in 1917./nIt was around this time that the governor of Wakayama Prefecture and his friends finished the planning of the Minakata Botanical Institute. The prospectus was drafted by Tanaka Ch\u014dzabur\u014d and promoted by 30 big names including those from the political and literary worlds, including Hara Takashi, \u014ckuma Shigenobu, Yorimichi Tokugawa, and Rohan Koda./nMinakata came to Tokyo for the first time in 36 years and spent five months raising money. Day after day he visited notable figures in politics and academia including Prime Minister Takahashi Korekiyo asking for support. He finally collected a considerable sum, but it was less than the prospect amount. He continued his fundraising campaign at home./nThe famous \u2018Resume\u2019 was written then responding to a request from Yoshio Yabuki, deputy branch manager of Nippon Yusen in Osaka, whom he had asked for donation. The resume, written on 7.7m long paper using fine strokes, is an autograph of extreme importance to understand the real Minakata and perhaps the longest resume in Japan and the first resume ever known in light of the volume and quality of information it contains./nIn March 1925, Kumaya became ill and went into a hospital in Wakayama City. After going home to recuperate, Minakata shut the gate against all visitors. This lasted for three years until Kumaya was moved to a hospital in Kyoto in May 1928. Fair success of the fundraising in Tokyo was offset in a way by an unfulfilled promise of Tsunegusu, one of the major promoters of the project. He didn't provide 20,000 yen, his part of donation, which caused a rift between the two brothers. Minakata also had trouble making a living because of expensive medical bills. To lessen the financial burden, Minakata published three books in 1926. The books, compilations of theses previously published in various journals, gave the reader an insight into his arguments consistent throughout the years and revealed again his erudition, which aroused the admiration of the public./nEmperor Hirohito, also a biologist, had shown a strong interest in slime molds since he was the Prince Regent. As the Prince, he had read A Monograph of the Slime Molds by Gulielma Lister and told Dr. Hirotaro Hattori of the National Biological Research Institute of his wish to see the specimens. Having learned this interest, Shiro Koaze approached Minakata and his friends from Tokyo University. In November 1926 the team prepared and presented Prince Hirohito with a collection of 90 specimens of 37 genera of Japanese slime molds. It bore the signatures of Koaze as the presenter and Minakata as the selector./nIn March 1929, Dr. Hattori secretly visited and requested Minakata to give a lecturer on slime molds to Hirohito, then Emperor, in his future royal visit to the Wakayama region. Minakata telegraphed his acceptance. With no precedent for a commoner giving an imperial lecture, he soon became the center of the public attention and extremely busy preparing specimens. On June 1, 1929, it had been raining since morning. Minakata headed for Kashima Island in a frock coat he had bought in America and kept for years. After taking the Emperor for a walk in the woods on the island, Minakata, while showing specimens, gave him a 25-minute lecture, on board the royal ship Nagato, on slime molds and marine life. He also presented the Emperor with gifts including 110 specimens of slime molds kept in empty taffy boxes./nA chamberlain recalled: \"Rumors of his eccentricity had made me doubt his capability, but my worry turned out to be utterly groundless when I met this well-mannered and polite man. He was a gentleman who had experience of living abroad as well as a traditional Japanese who showed a respect for the Imperial Family.\" It was the most glorious day in Minakata's life. In the afternoon, he took pictures of him and Matsue in their finest attire at a studio and shared the moment with his relatives and close friends by giving sweets he had received from the Imperial Household. Next year, in commemoration of the Emperor's visit to Kashima, a monument was erected on the edge of a dense wood near the point where the emperor had landed. Inscribed on the monument is a poem Minakata wrote hoping that the island would be protected forever by the benevolence and the power of the Emperor. In May 1962, more than 30 years later, the Emperor and Empress visited southern Wakayama again. Inspired by a view of Kashima from a hotel room on the Shirahama Beach the Emperor composed a waka poem, which was inscribed on the monument erected in front of the Minakata Kumagusu Museum overlooking the Kashima island.:/nThrough the rain I see the dim figure of Kashima in the distanceWhich reminds me of Kumagusu who was born in Wakayama/nThe Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, as the war escalated, the people's life was impoverished. Minakata was not an exception. The loss of his old friends gave him an additional blow. He gradually ruined his health and stayed in bed. Although collapsing many times, he continued to work towards the completion of Nihon (the illustrated manual of Japanese fungi; drawing pictures), writing notes and giving advice to his colleagues./nIn December 1941, soon after the Pacific War had erupted, Minakata was in a critical condition. On the 29 December he murmured, \u201cI can see purple flowers blooming on the ceiling\u201d and closed 75 years of a life filled with ups and downs. He was buried at the Kouzanji Temple in Tanabe City overlooking Kashima island./nYoung Minakata leaped out into the wider world when Japan was going through a metamorphosis from a feudal state into a westernized modern country. He went to America then to UK searching for a place where anybody, regardless of class, could study freely. He found it in the British Museum, where he put his heart and soul into research while buried in hundreds of books, arts and crafts and antiquities from the East and the West./nWith \"The Constellations in the Far East\" as a start, he contributed a total of 50 theses to Nature and hundreds of articles and essays to the folklore magazine Notes and Queries. This large number of articles shows he won an important place in the British academia./nHe was blessed with an extraordinary memory and manipulated more than 10 languages. In addition, plenty of experience of copying books enabled him to master how to scrutinize empirical documents and the methods of comparative cultural studies, which was the basis of his unbounded capacity in writing. Junishiko (A Study of Twelve Animals of Chinese Zodiac), one of his most important works, is an example./nAfter coming back to Japan he wrote a number of articles in quick succession for Japanese journals and magazines.

During the spring of 2020, Wyllie and others in Nathan Grubaugh's lab developed a test called SalivaDirect, described as simpler, cheaper, and less invasive than nasopharyngeal testing. The SalivaDirect test collects saliva in a tube without requiring a swab and thus does not require collection by healthcare workers. It also does not involve RNA extraction, allowing direct PCR testing of samples, and cutting the time required to process samples as well as the expense of testing. Removing the RNA extraction from the process also allows a wider range of laboratories to engage in saliva testing than nasopharyngeal testing.[10][11]/nIn April 2020, Wyllie, as lead author, submitted a paper to The New England Journal of Medicine describing the team's research; it was published in August 2020.[2]/nThis work sparked interest from the NBA which was keen to pursue saliva-testing as a means to run a season more safely. Funding from the NBA supported the development, validation, and optimization of SalivaDirect while providing a test population to validate the test for use in asymptomatic people.\u00a0The SalivaDirect test received FDA emergency use authorization in August 2020, allowing for its nationwide rollout. Through the Fast Grant, part of the Emergent Ventures scheme set up by economist Tyler Cowen, she was able to raise an additional $500,000 to support the further development of the test and to support local testing efforts. For her efforts, Wyllie was dubbed the \"Spit Queen\" in an interview on NPR.[10]/nIn August 2021, Wyllie wrote to New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern to express her concerns over the slow rollout of saliva testing in New Zealand, when other countries had been saliva-testing widely for over a year.[9][12] She was also critical of the method used to validate the saliva test conducted by Asia Pacific Healthcare Group (APHG) in New Zealand, saying that APHG was using methods that were not widely used overseas.[13][12] In September 2021, Wyllie said in an interview on Radio New Zealand that the New Zealand government had been \"badly advised\" with respect to saliva testing.[14] In response, Anoop Singh, the chief executive of APHG, questioned Wyllie's qualifications and the relevance of her research, and claimed that saliva samples could be tested in the same way as nasopharyngeal swabs (i.e. with RNA extraction).[1] Singh was reported as saying, \"Sorry who is Anne Wyllie? Who is Anne Wyllie? She's a research scientist sitting in the US on some university campus. How is she qualified?\"[15] Singh's comments led to a social media backlash, including the creation of Wyllie's English Wikipedia page.[15]/nAPHG was contracted by the New Zealand Ministry of Health to deliver saliva testing beginning in May 2021, but the programme did not begin until August. Singh blamed the delay between contracting and roll-out on the Ministry of Health.[1][16]/nWyllie represented the Yale School of Public Health at the September 2021 Global COVID-\u206019 Summit hosted by president Joe Biden.[17][18]/nWyllie received a Medal of Excellence from the Northcote College Board of Trustees in 2020.

He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, a Fellow of the AAAS and the American Society of Microbiology.  In 2009, he was awarded the prestigious International Antonio Feltrinelli Prize for Medicine.  His wife, Linda Pastan, was an American poet./nPastan attended the Boston Public Latin School, Tufts College, and Tufts Medical School. He did his residency at the Yale School of Medicine (1957-1959)./nPastan conducted research training in endocrinology at NIH with Earl Stadtman starting in 1959.  In 1970, he founded the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) in the National Cancer Institute (the largest Institute of the National Institutes of Health).  He is currently co-chief of the LMB and is working on various Immunotoxin Therapies./nPastan pioneered the field of receptor biology in animal cells and identified a major receptor mediated pathway of gene regulation in bacteria. With Robert L. Perlman, he established the first general mechanism of positive gene regulation in bacteria showing that cyclic AMP and its receptor protein CRP (cyclic AMP receptor protein) positively regulated the activity of many genes.[1][2] These studies serve as a paradigm for the mechanism of action of cyclic AMP and steroid hormones on gene expression in animal cells. His current research is focused on developing Recombinant Immunotoxins (RITs) as a new treatment for cancer. Gene splicing techniques are used to make chimeric proteins in which the Fv of an antibody, preferentially binding to a cancer cell, is attached to a potent bacterial toxin./nAdditionally, with his colleague Jesse Roth, he was the first to clearly demonstrate the presence of specific protein receptors on the surface of animal cells.[3][4][5] To explain the biochemical basis of hyperthyroidism, Pastan showed that antibodies from the serum of patients with hyperthyroidism specifically activated thyroid gland adenylate cyclase, providing an immunological mechanism for hyperthyroidism.[6] He then proceeded to study hormone interactions with living cells using fluorescence photo-bleaching to visualize polypeptide hormone-receptor complexes bound to the membrane of living cells. He showed these complexes were highly mobile and clustered before entry into cells, and measured their lateral diffusion coefficients.[7][8] In collaboration with Mark Willingham, he developed and used video intensified microscopy to visualize fluorescently labeled insulin and EGF forming clusters on the surface of living cells prior to entry through the endocytic pathway.[9][10] These studies identified the pathway by which growth factors enter cells and established a mechanism that helped explain down-regulation of receptors and the loss of growth factor responsiveness./nFollowing the identification of the EGF receptor by Stanley Cohen, Pastan and colleagues made several seminal advances that identified the EGF receptor as a proto-oncogene. Besides being one of the first 3 laboratories to obtain the DNA sequence of the EGF receptor,[11] they showed that the EGF receptor gene was amplified, rearranged and over-expressed in many cancer cells including squamous cell carcinomas,[12][13] and with Doug Lowy showed that over-expression of the EGF receptor in the presence of EGF is sufficient to transform normal 3T3 cells and therefore is a proto-oncogene.[14] Altogether these studies provided much of the framework that ultimately led to the use of antibodies targeted to the EGF receptor as a cancer therapy./nPastan is currently developing a new therapy for cancer by making fusion proteins composed of the Fv portion of monoclonal antibodies directed at receptor proteins on cancer cells fused to a genetically modified form of a powerful bacterial toxin, Pseudomonas exotoxin A.[15] Three of these genetically engineered proteins, which he named recombinant immunotoxins (RITs), are being tested in humans with various forms of cancer. One of these, HA22 or Moxetumomab pasudotox (Moxe), targets CD22 on B cell malignancies; it has produced many complete and durable remissions in chemotherapy resistant Hairy cell leukemia and is now in a phase 3 trial to gain FDA approval.[16][17] Moxe also produced complete remissions in children with drug resistant Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and is being developed for the treatment of that disease./nAnother immunotoxin, SS1P,[18] targets the mesothelin antigen. Mesothelin was discovered by Pastan and his colleague Mark Willingham and is a promising target for cancer immunotherapy, because it is expressed on many cancers: mesothelioma, ovarian, lung, pancreatic stomach cancers and cholangiocarcinoma, but not on essential organs.[19][20][21] SS1P has shown anti-tumor activity in a phase I trial when combined with chemotherapy. In a recently completed clinical trial, SS1P was combined with the immunosuppressive drugs cyclophosphamide and pentostatin and produced remarkable major and sustained tumor regressions lasting up to 2 years in patients with advanced chemotherapy resistant mesothelioma.[22] Tumor shrinkage of this magnitude and duration has never before been observed in mesothelioma./nPastan\u2019s current efforts are directed at improving the activity and usefulness of immunotoxins he has developed. One of the major obstacles to the success of RIT therapy is that antibodies often form and neutralize the RIT preventing additional treatment cycles. Pastan has developed methods to make active RITs in which the major B cell and T cell epitopes have been identified and silenced.[23][24] An RIT with reduced immunogenicity that targets mesothelin expressing cancers is being prepared for clinical trials to begin in 2014.", "27580753": "J\u00fcrgen Haffer (9 December 1932 in Berlin \u2013 26 April 2010 in Essen) was a German ornithologist, biogeographer, and geologist.

After qualifying as a physician, Rolleston became a Fellow of Pembroke College in 1851, holding posts at the British Civil Hospital, Smyrna (during Crimean War), and Assistant Physician, Children's Hospital, London (1857). Gradually he became more interested in zoology, and spent the rest of his career as a zoologist, and on the human sciences. His research included comparative anatomy, physiology, zoology, archaeology and anthropology. In 1860, he was elected to the newly founded Linacre Professorship of Anatomy and Physiology, which he held to the time of his death.

For example, the Scientific American commented that \"even though one may not wholly surrender to Mr. Reinheimer's argument, or accord to his theory that supreme importance with which he invests it, there are in his volume so many important related facts, and so much pause-compelling suggestion, that his work must be reckoned with in any future study of Nature's methods.\"[12] The book was positively reviewed in The Lancet journal which concluded it would be read with interest by many biologists.[13]/nAnthropologist Ashley Montagu wrote that Reinheimer's book Symbiosis \"which is all too little known, presents a very stimulating and well-balanced account of the facts\".[14] The book was criticized by botanist C.

His early education was carried on in Zurich, and he entered the university there in 1836. After two years, however, he moved to the University of Bonn, and later to that of Berlin, becoming a pupil of noted physiologists Johannes Peter M\u00fcller and of Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle. He graduated in philosophy at Zurich in 1841, and in medicine at Heidelberg in 1842. The first academic post which he held was that of prosector of anatomy under Henle, but his tenure of this office was brief\u00a0\u2013 in 1844 he returned to Zurich University to occupy a chair as professor extraordinary of physiology and comparative anatomy. His stay here was also brief; in 1847 the University of W\u00fcrzburg, attracted by his rising fame, offered him the post of professor of physiology and of microscopical and comparative anatomy. He accepted the appointment, and at W\u00fcrzburg he remained thenceforth, refusing all offers tempting him to leave the quiet academic life of the Bavarian town, where he died.[1]/nMany of the numerous memoirs which he published, (including the very first paper he wrote) and which appeared in 1841, before he graduated, were on the structure of animals of the most varied kinds. Notable among these were his papers on the Medusae and allied creatures. His activity in this direction led him to make zoological excursions to the Mediterranean Sea and to the coasts of Scotland, as well as to undertake, conjointly with his friend Carl Theodor Ernst von Siebold, the editorship of the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Wissenschaftliche Zoologie, which, founded in 1848, continued under his hands to be one of the most important zoological periodicals.[2]/nHis hand was one of the first to be x-rayed, by his friend Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen.[3]/nK\u00f6lliker made contributions to the study of zoology. His earlier efforts were directed to the invertebrates, and his memoir on the development of cephalopods (which appeared in 1844) is considered a classical work.  He soon passed on to the vertebrates, and studied the amphibians and mammalian embryos. He was among the first, if not the very first, to introduce into this branch of biological inquiry the newer microscopic technique \u2013 the methods of hardening, sectioning and staining. Much of the progress which embryology made during the middle and latter half of the 19th century are associated with his name.[citation needed] His Lectures on Development, published in 1861, at once became a standard work.[2]/nBut neither zoology nor embryology furnished K\u00f6lliker's chief claim to fame. If he did much for these branches of science, he did still more for histology, the knowledge of the minute structure of the animal tissues. Among his earlier results was the demonstration in 1847 that smooth or unstriated muscle is made up of distinct units, of nucleated muscle cells. In this work, he followed in the footsteps of his master Henle. A few years before this, there was doubt whether arteries had muscle in their walls \u2013 in addition, no solid histological basis as yet existed for those views as to the action of the nervous system on the circulation, which were soon to be put forward, and which had such a great influence on the progress of physiology.[2]/nK\u00f6lliker's contributions to histology were widespread; smooth muscle, striated muscle, skin, bone, teeth, blood vessels and viscera were all investigated by K\u00f6lliker. The results at which he arrived were recorded partly in separate memoirs, partly in his great textbook on microscopical anatomy, which first saw the light in 1850.[2]/nAlbert L. Lehninger asserted that K\u00f6lliker was among the first to notice the arrangement of granules in the sarcoplasm of striated muscle over a period of years beginning around 1850. These granules were later called sarcosomes by Retzius in 1890. These sarcosomes have come to be known as the mitochondria-the power houses of the cell. In the words of Lehninger, \"K\u00f6lliker should also be credited with the first separation of mitochondria from cell structure. In 1888 he teased these granules from insect muscle, in which they are very profuse, found them to swell in water, and showed them to possess a membrane.\"[citation needed]/nIn the case of almost every tissue, our present knowledge contains information first discovered by K\u00f6lliker \u2013 it is for his work on the nervous system that his name is most remembered. As early as 1845, while still at Zurich, he supplied a clear proof that nerve fibers are continuous with nerve cells, and laying the groundwork for all later research as to the actions of the central nervous system.[2]/nFrom that time onward he continually laboured at the histology of the nervous system, and more especially at the difficult problems presented by the intricate patterns in which nerve fibers and neurons are woven together in the brain and spinal cord.  From his early days a master of method, he saw at a glance the value of the new Golgi staining method for the investigation of the central nervous system. K\u00f6lliker contributed greatly to knowledge of the inner structure of the brain.[2][4] In 1889, he reproduces the histological preparations of the father of neuroscience Ram\u00f3n y Cajal and confirmed the theory of neuronism./nK\u00f6lliker was ennobled by prince regent Luitpold of Bavaria in 1897 and thus permitted to add the predicate \"von\" to his surname.[citation needed] He was made a member of the learned societies of many countries; in England, which he visited more than once, and where he became well known, the Royal Society made him a fellow in 1860, and in 1897 gave him its highest token of esteem, the Copley medal.[2]/nA species of lizard, Hyalosaurus koellikeri, is named in his honor.[5]/nIn 1864 K\u00f6lliker revived \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire's theory that evolution proceeds by large steps (saltationism), under the name of heterogenesis.[7] K\u00f6lliker was a critic of Darwinism and rejected a universal common ancestor, instead he supported a theory of common descent along separate lines.[8] According to Alexander Vucinich the non-Darwinian evolution theory of K\u00f6lliker tied \"organic transformism to three general ideas, all contrary to Darwin's view: the multiple origin of living forms, the internal causes of variation, and \"sudden leaps\" (heterogenesis) in the evolutionary process.\"[9]\nK\u00f6lliker claimed that heterogenesis functioned according to a general law of evolutionary progress, orthogenesis.[10]", "41048441": "Alex Benjamin Novikoff ((1913-02-28)28 February 1913 \u2013 (1987-01-09)9 January 1987) was a Russian Empire-born American biologist who is recognized for his pioneering works in the discoveries of cell organelles. A victim of American Cold War antagonism to communism that he supported, he is also recognized as a public figure of the mid-20th century at the height of McCarthyism in America.[1][2] As his original discoveries such as cell organelles and autophagy earned other scientists Nobel Prizes, he is regarded as one of the overlooked scientists to get Nobel Prize.[3]/nNovikoff's most important achievements were in developing histochemical techniques that were used for discovering and are being used for studying structures and functions of cells. After he developed cell fractionation method, it became possible to identify and isolate cell organelles. He was the first to describe lysosome using electron microscopy; his collaborator Christian de Duve received Nobel Prize for the discovery. He was also the first to understand the process of cell eating, which he called \"cytolysomes,\" now known as autophagy, another Nobel Prize-winning discovery. He developed the method for making liver cancer cells, later called Novikoff hepatoma, which paved the way for cellular experiments in cancer studies./nBeing accused of participation in Communist Party as disloyalty to the nation, Novikoff was dismissed in 1953 from the University of Vermont College of Medicine where he was serving as a tenured professor, upon his refusal to cooperate in disclosing his communist friends. He was even denied twice of his willingness to serve in the US Army during the Second World War. Due to lack of substantial evidence, the case itself was dismissed after twenty years. The incident has become popularly known as the \"Novikoff Affair\", and is the most notable case of MaCarthyism in Vermont. In 1983, after thirty years of his banishment, the university made an apology by presenting him an honorary degree.[4]/nNovikoff was born to Jewish parents in the small town of Semenivka in the Russian Empire. Hoping to overcome severe poverty under the then Soviet Union, his family emigrated to the United States. The family settled in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, New York. His father earned their living by working as a salesman in a garment factory. Novikoff was a precocious boy, developing an early fascination for biology. His hobbies included skinning and dissecting animal corpses, and he once boiled a dead cat to observe its skeleton. He skipped four grades, and completed high school when he was only fourteen years of age.[1] He graduated with B.S. degree from Columbia University in 1931 at the age of eighteen.[5][6] Even under financial constraints, the family encouraged him to study medicine. However, antisemitism at the time prevented him from entering medical school. He therefore pursued the only open opportunity by continuing at the same university to study zoology. He joined the graduate school in 1931,[2] and completed his M.A. in 1933.[5]/nWhile still at the graduate school, to support his studies, Novikoff worked as a part-time instructor at the new Brooklyn College. His initial research focused on experimental embryology, and soon his interest shifted to cell biology under the influence of Arthur Pollister.[2] At age twenty-three, in 1936, he published his first technical paper titled \"Transplantation of the polar lobe in Sabellaria vulgaris.\"[7] In 1938 he was awarded his PhD. He was not on good terms with the other teachers and the administration at Brooklyn College, such that his promotion was delayed for a year even after his new degree. He did a post-doc at the University of Wisconsin in 1946\u20131947.[1] In 1947 he joined the University of Vermont College of Medicine as Professor of Experimental Pathology and Biochemistry. He was expelled from the institute in 1953 on charges of disloyalty to the nation. In 1955 he joined the faculty of pathology at the newly established Albert Einstein College of Medicine, becoming full professor in 1958. He worked there for the rest of his life.[5]/nDuring his career at Vermont, Novikoff had successfully developed a technique of cell fractionation. Using this he had separated cell fractions and identified six cell organelles, along with two unidentified fractions. Christian de Duve from Belgium became interested in the unknown fractions. In 1952 de Duve proposed that the fraction contained membrane-bound particle having specific enzymatic activity. Novikoff confirmed the enzyme activity in 1953.[8] The two met at Central Park in New York City to discuss their results. In 1955, now confident that the membranous particles were cell organelles, de Duve gave a hypothetical name \"lysosomes\" to reflect their digestive properties.[9] That same year, after visiting de Duve's laboratory, using his own histochemical protocol Novikoff successfully produced the first real images (electron micrographs) of the new organelle. In 1965 with de Duve, he confirmed the location of the hydrolytic enzymes of lysosomes.[10][11] Novikoff further established the importance of lysosomes in diseases. \"It is largely due to Novikoff's bold and imaginative use of morphological techniques,\" de Duve praised him, \"that lysosomes have come to be recognized in a broader biological context.\" de Duve went on to win the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1974 for the discovery of lysosomes, but Novikoff's contributions were forgotten.[12]/nIn 1956 Novikoff described a new class of membrane-bound organelles that he called \"dense bodies.\"[10] was the first to describe the actual lysosomal functions with respect to degradation of mitochondria. However he thought that the digestive activities he observed were due to other intracellular organelles which he called \"cytolysomes\".[13] It was at the Ciba Foundation Symposium on Lysosomes held in London on 12\u201314 February 1963, that he explained this phenomenon in which organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, mitochondria and other cell debris were degraded by autolysis in the cytolysomes. Then the following speaker de Duve correctly identified that these organelles were lysosomes, and named them autophagic vacuoles, and he introduced the term \"autophagy\" for the process of such intracellular digestion.[11][14] In 1962 he established for the first time the functional relationship between ER, Golgi and lysosomes. He specifically showed that smooth-surfaced derivatives of the ER fused with the Golgi membranes and the Golgi membranes in turn fused with lysosomes.[15] He was the first to show that this GERL is responsible vesicular transport during synthesis and sorting of proteins.[16] He gave this functional organisation an acronym GERL, for Golgi-endoplasmic reticulum-lysosome.  Novikoff's further works became a milestone in understanding the importance of autophagy in diseases such as cancer.[17]/nHe was the first to establish the type of liver tumour, now known in his honour as \"Novikoff hepatoma\".[18][19] In 1961 with Sidney Goldfischer, Novikoff developed a staining method for the Golgi body using the enzyme nucleosidediphosphatase, by which they described the enzymatic property of the organelle for the first time.[20] In 1969 they developed a staining technique (alkaline diaminobenzidine, or DAB) by which they studied the structure of another new organelle, peroxisome, for the first time.[21] In 1969 he gave the first clear-cut distinction between lysosomes and peroxisomes.[22] In 1972, he and his wife discovered a new type of peroxisomes from the intestinal epithelium of rat, which they named \"microperoxisome\".[23][24][12][25]/nHis works in cell biology are best summed up in a textbook he wrote with his student Eric Holtzman, Cells and Organelles, first published in 1970.[26]/nIn 1935, Novikoff joined the Communist Party while he was working for PhD. He was most inspired by the scientific attitude of Marxism towards the well-being of society, beside other idealistic issues. He helped writing and disseminating party newsletters in the Brooklyn campus, which was a centre of communist activity in the area. He became actively involved in the teachers' union and particularly fought against stratification of junior and senior faculty in the college. This caused serious antagonism with other teachers and the administration. In 1940 under a new college president, Novikoff was investigated for affiliation to the Communist Party. However, no further action was taken against him.[2]/nDuring the Second World War he voluntarily applied to serve in the US military on a medical commission. His applications were declined twice, in 1943 and in 1944.[1][2] The objections were based on the allegations in the previous documents that his \"loyalty\" to the nation was doubtful. Ironically, he was employed by the US Army after the war, in 1948, to analyse two films about enzyme and carbohydrate metabolism. Even then doubt about his loyalty resurfaced and his appointment was terminated soon after he completed the major work.[2]/nIn 1953 while he was a permanent faculty at the University of Vermont College of Medicine, at the time McCarthyism was at its height, anti-communist activists once again targeted him for his 1930s involvement in the Communist Party. But this time the case was taken to the federal level. On 23 April 1953, he refused to testify before the Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security at Washington, D.C., on anything about his past political life, especially on identification of his communist colleagues at Brooklyn College. His denial was taken as \"positive evidence that he was the leader of communist-dominated union.\"[27] Although he invoked the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution, the Vermont administration made sure that the institute dismiss him. The then Vermont Governor Lee E. Emerson persuaded the university President Carl Borgmann to convene a six-person committee consisting of faculty and board of trustees, to assure that the \"faculty is 100 percent pro-American and anti-communist\". Even though the committee, chaired by Robert Joyce, voted 5 to 1 for Novikoff to remain in his profession, Emerson convinced the board of trustees to override the committee's decision.[1]/nThe trustees therefore suspended Novikoff on 16 July initially for a month, with the \"walk or talk\" ultimatum that if Novikoff would not return to Washington to reveal names before the Senate Committee, he would be dismissed from the university. Members of the university's chapter of the American Association of University Professors could convince Borgmann in August 1953 that it was against the university bylaws to suspend Novikoff before any public hearing. Then a final hearing was convened that consisted of 23-member board of review, which included the governor, members of the board of trustees, and several faculty members. The board meeting on 29 August voted 14 to 8 to recommend the dismissal of Novikoff. A week later, on 5 September, the fifteen-member board of trustees confirmed his firing from the university, with a single dissenting vote from Robert Joyce.[28][29][30] His case was kept open for twenty years, and having found no substantiated evidence, the FBI closed his file in 1974, which by then contained 822 pages.[1] Vermont University then conferred him an honorary doctorate of science as a way of apology in 1983, after thirty years of his dismissal, with 8,000 audience giving standing ovation,[4][31][32] and the university saluted his \"integrity and courage.\"[2]/nNovikoff died on Friday, 28 January 1987, at the hospital of Albert Einstein College of Medicine. He is survived by his wife Dr Phyllis, two sons, two sisters (Lillian and Sonia), and two grandchildren.[4]", "39573909": "Gilles-\u00c9ric S\u00e9ralini (born 23 August 1960) is a French molecular biologist, political advisor and activist on genetically modified organisms and foods. He is of Algerian-French origin. S\u00e9ralini has been a professor of molecular biology at the University of Caen since 1991, and is president and chairman of the board of CRIIGEN.[2]/nHis work and publication strategies on GMOs have been controversial.[3] A paper he published in 2012 attracted major controversy and was retracted by the journal./nS\u00e9ralini was born on 23 August 1960 in B\u00f4ne, Algeria, during the Algerian War of Independence. His father was a telecommunications technician and his mother was a schoolteacher.[4] His family soon settled in Thonon-les-Bains, Haute Savoie, and then Nice, France./nIn 1987, S\u00e9ralini obtained his doctoral degree from the University of Montpellier II. He then did four years of research at, among other places, the University of Western Ontario and Laval University Medical Center. S\u00e9ralini underwent research on corticosteroid-binding globulin, before being appointed a professor at the University of Caen in June 1991, a position he has held ever since. The general area of his lab's research focuses on the endocrine system,[5] in particular the enzyme aromatase. His lab has synthesized a number of aromatase inhibitors using equine aromatase as a model.[6][non-primary source needed] His research has been published in the Journal of Histochemistry & Cytochemistry, the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology./nIn 1997, he became interested in genetically modified organisms, publicly appealing for the precautionary principle to be followed.[5] He was appointed to various government posts, including roles in the French government, the European Union and the European Commission.[7] From 1998 till 2007 S\u00e9ralini was a member of the French Biomolecular Engineering Commission which was tasked with evaluating GMO allowances for both the French Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of the Environment./nS\u00e9ralini founded the Committee of Research and Independent Information on Genetic Engineering (CRIIGEN) with Corine Lepage, a former politician, and Pierre-Henri Gouyon, a professor from the Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle, in 1999.[5] CRIIGEN is publicly opposed to genetically modified food (GM food).[8][9][10] S\u00e9ralini founded CRIIGEN because he judged that studies on GM food safety were inadequate, and questioned their acceptance.[8]/nIn 2007, S\u00e9ralini and two other authors from the University of Caen and the University of Rouen published a Greenpeace-funded paper using data obtained from rat feeding studies conducted by Monsanto in 2004.[11][12][13] They concluded that the genetically modified maize used, MON 863, resulted in significant variations to the control rats weight, triglyceride levels and urine composition.[11] They also concluded it effected the liver, kidney, adrenal glands, heart, and haematopoietic system and recommended that safety experiments continue beyond 90 days.[11] Greenpeace cited the study in a press release calling for MON 863's recall and a review of testing methods.[14]/nThe paper prompted the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to reexamine the MON 863 safety data. It asked EU countries for any new data about the strain, new opinions on the original Monsanto study and a technical meeting with the authors of the 2007 CRIIGEN paper. The EFSA concluded that all blood chemistry and organ weight values fell within the normal range for the control animals in question[15] and that the S\u00e9ralini paper used incorrect statistical methods.[16] In 2010 Markos Kyprianou (European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Policy) confirmed the doubts in a report to the European Parliament.[17] The French Commission du G\u00e9nie Biomol\u00e9culaire (AFBV) also reached critical conclusions.[18] \"Food Standards Australia New Zealand attributed the differences between rats fed MON 863 corn and control rats to normal biological variation (for the species in question).\"[19][20]/nIn 2009, the S\u00e9ralini lab published another study, which re-analyzed toxicity data for glyphosate resistant, MON 810 and MON 863 strains, concluded that they showed liver, kidney and heart damages in the rats.[21] EFSA found no base for the claims and saw many of the statistical criticisms of the 2007 paper applying to the 2009 paper also.[22] The French High Council of Biotechnologies Scientific Committee\u00a0[fr] (HCB) concluded that S\u00e9ralini 2009 \"..presents no admissible scientific element likely to ascribe any haematological, hepatic or renal toxicity to the three re-analysed GMOs.\"[23] Food Standards Australia New Zealand had a similar result.[24] The HCB also questioned the authors' independence.[23]/nA 2011 review by S\u00e9ralini, using data from 19 published animal feeding studies and several animal feeding studies submitted for regulatory approval, continued to conclude that GM food had liver and kidney effects, and advocated for longer and more elaborate toxicology tests for regulatory approval.[25][non-primary source needed]/nOn 19 September 2012, S\u00e9ralini and his colleagues published a peer-reviewed paper funded by CRIIGIN titled \"Long-term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize\" in Food and Chemical Toxicology (FCT).[26] It involved a two-year study of genetically modified corn and the herbicide RoundUp fed to rats.[27] At a press conference announcing his paper, S\u00e9ralini emphasized the study's potential cancer implications. Photographs from the journal article of treated rats with large tumors were widely circulated in the press.[28] In November 2013, the FCT editors retracted the paper,[29] with the editor-in-chief saying that its results were inconclusive.[27][30] In June 2014 the text of the article was republished in Environmental Sciences Europe.[31]/nWith a few exceptions, the scientific community dismissed the S\u00e9ralini study and called for a more rigorous peer-review system in scientific journals.[32]/nAfter S\u00e9ralini published his 2012 corn study in parallel with a book and a documentary called Tous Cobayes\u00a0!, various French Academies wrote a common bulletin expressing a number of concerns related to the study. The bulletin criticizes the science behind the study, questions the ethics of the study's authors and the standards of the publishing journal (Food and Chemical Toxicology), and states concern over the social consequences of what the bulletin's authors perceive to be scaremongering in the area of GMOs. Signatories of the bulletin included the Acad\u00e9mie d'agriculture de France, Acad\u00e9mie nationale de m\u00e9decine, Acad\u00e9mie nationale de pharmacie, Acad\u00e9mie des sciences, Acad\u00e9mie des technologies and Acad\u00e9mie v\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire de France.[33]/nIn May 2013, shortly before a debate was scheduled to take place on the topic of genetically modified foods, held by the libertarian think tank Cato Institute, both S\u00e9ralini and consumer activist Jeffrey M. Smith withdrew from the debate. Smith disapproved of the planned inclusion of molecular biologist Kevin Folta and S\u00e9ralini accused Jon Entine, who organized the debate's panel, of libel.[34]/nIn 2014, S\u00e9ralini et al. published a study claiming that pesticides were more toxic than regulatory bodies had previously thought.[35]  The study prompted Ralf Reski, one of the editors of BioMed Research International, the journal in which it was published, to resign. Reski said, \"I do not want to be connected to a journal that provides [S\u00e9ralini] a forum for such kind of agitation.\"[36]/nVarious journalists criticized S\u00e9ralini's strategy towards the public, since he asked media to sign non-disclosure agreements before the publishing and tried to interdict requests to other scientists. The publication strategy overall has been deemed flawed and questionable again, as it connected allegedly flawed scientific studies, various publications, books and films in parallel while trying to silence scientific and public debate in a broad political campaign of questionable value.[3][37][38]/nA 2016 paper published by Seralini claims homeopathic remedies protect against acute glyphosate intake alleged toxicity.[39][non-primary source needed]  This claim is without any scientific basis or evidence. A strong consensus prevails among the scientific community that homeopathy is a pseudo-scientific,[40][41][42][43] unethical[44][45] and implausible line of treatment.[46][47][48][49]/nGilles-Eric S\u00e9ralini has published various studies and a book Nous pouvons nous d\u00e9polluer (We are able to detox ourselves, 2009) claiming certain plant based pharmaceuticals based on homeopathy[citation needed] were being able to decrease poisonous influences.[50] The related lab received funding from Sevene Pharma to study the detoxifying capacity of their plant extracts on Roundup residues, bisphenol A and atrazine. S\u00e9ralini participated and received payment for a lecture in a two-day seminar organized by Sevene Pharma.[51]/nIn 2010, S\u00e9ralini sued University of Paris VII Marc Fellous\u00a0[fr], president of the French Association of Plant Biotechnology\u00a0[fr] and the Association, for libel, claiming that they had unjustly criticized his scientific ability and his research because of its funder, Greenpeace.  The judge ruled that because Fellous and other critics had financial ties to the agricultural biotechnology industry, their charge about the Greenpeace funding was defamatory, but refused to rule on the scientific matter.  Fellous was fined 1000 euros. S\u00e9ralini was awarded a symbolic 1 euro in damages and court costs.[52]", "64215465": "Trevor S.

Born to Anton Nezlobinski, a forest engineer who instilled in Nezlobinski a love towards nature and animals. In 1907, he became a student at the Military Medical Academy at the Russian capital Saint Petersburg. He was a hard-working student for which he received a recognition in the form of a golden medal for his work, titled The significance of plate worms.[1]/nHe finished his studies at the academy in 1912 and as a military scholarship student, he remained as a military doctor. During World War I, young Nezlobinski was a doctor at the Russian Black Sea Fleet. After the victory at the October Revolution, as a member of the White Guardsmen, Nezlobinski was forced to leave Russia and together with his wife Sofija and several friends, he arrived to Yugoslavia, where he was assigned for duty in the town of Kriva Palanka. On 28 August 1924, Nezlobinski, together with his wife and collaborators, arrived in Struga with the assignment of getting rid of malaria, which at the time caused major problems in the city and the surroundings. He was accompanied by several other Russian migrants: Georgi Rudnev, Aleksandar Lukin, who was a lawyer and worked as a judge in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia together with his wife; Mikail Makarov, who was an officer and an engineer in Struga at the old train station and made a thermocentral out of a boat motor; as well as Boris Vladimirovi\u010d Baron de Bode, who was known in Struga as Baron Boris, who was sent to Struga from the watchtower at Saint Naum, where he was working at the border troop.[1]/nNezlobinski became following, systematically studying and investigating the health and hygiene-sanitary conditions and based on his findings, it was established that 50% from Struga's population including neighbouring villages nearby Strushko Blado, was suffering from malaria. To fix that, Nezlobinski took several measures including the construction of an arterial well, he prepared and formed an antimalarial dispenser and within it, he also opened a hospital with which he became the founder of the first health institution in Struga.[2]/nTo make the hospital start working, Nezlobinski made his collaborators active. Georgi Rudnev was in charge of the laboratory and was given the function of laboratory technician, while Mihail Markov was a nurse, handling and maintaining equipment which served as the doctor's means of furnishing the hospital. With time, Nezlobinski, included people from the local population as part of the medical staffing.

This showed for the first time that synthetic alternatives to DNA could store genetic information just like DNA.[1][11]/nFurther work by the Holliger lab enabled the in vitro evolution of XNA ligands (aptamers)[1] and XNA catalysts similar to RNA enzymes (known as ribozymes), termed XNAzymes[12] as well as the elaboration of simple XNA nanostructures.[13] The unnatural backbone chemistries of XNA molecules exhibit novel and useful properties. For example, unlike the natural nucleic acids, some XNAs cannot be broken down easily by the human body or are chemically much more stable. Recently, Holliger also described the synthesis and evolution of XNAs with an uncharged backbone, showing that genetic function (i.e. heredity and evolution) is possible \u2013 in contrast to previous proposals \u2013 even in the absence of a charged backbone.[14]/nOrigin of life/nHolliger has also made contributions towards a better understanding of early steps in the origin of life.[2][3] One scenario, termed the RNA world hypothesis, suggests that a key event in the origin of life was the emergence of an RNA molecule capable of self-replication and evolution, founding a primordial biology (lacking DNA and proteins) that relied on RNA for its main building blocks. Starting from a previously discovered ribozyme with RNA polymerase activity, Holliger and colleagues initially engineered an RNA polymerase ribozyme capable of synthesising another ribozyme[15] and subsequently RNA sequences longer than itself.[16] More recently, he described the first polymerase ribozyme that can use nucleotide triplets to copy highly structured RNA templates[17] including segments of itself./nIn the course of this work, Holliger explored the properties of water ice, a simple medium likely to have been widespread on the early Earth, and found that it promotes the activity, stability and evolution of RNA polymerase ribozymes[16] and the ability of diverse pools of RNA sequences to recombine enhancing pool complexity.[18] He also discovered that the steep concentration and temperature gradients resulting from freeze-thaw cycles could be harnessed to drive ribozyme assembly and folding, acting akin to chaperones in modern biology.[19]", "56285655": "Peter John Herring is an English marine biologist known for his work on the coloration, camouflage and bioluminescence of animals in the deep sea, and for the textbook The Biology of the Deep Ocean./nHerring took his Ph.D. at Cambridge University, spending 18 months at sea on the 1961-2 \nInternational Indian Ocean Expedition.

There, he investigated the coloration of animals in the deep sea, and their bioluminescence, relating its ecology and physiology to the colour vision of other animals.[3] One aspect of this was underwater camouflage, where prey need to conceal themselves from the vision of their predators; since as Herring noted, there is no background in the sea, the methods of camouflage employed are often different from those on land: key methods include transparency, reflection (by silvering), and counter-illumination.[4] He also studied the vision of shrimps in hydrothermal vents, and how the oxygen minimum in the northwestern Indian Ocean affected the distribution of midwater animals. He served as chief scientist on at least sixty research voyages.[3] In 1981 he discovered red bioluminescent \"searchlights\" below the eyes of some dragonfish, and showed that these worked by using fluorescent proteins which shifted the mainly blue light actually generated by these fish into the red part of the visible spectrum.[5]/nHerring has written or contributed to over 250 scientific papers and textbooks on marine zoology.

Ruth sensed the disdain that the distinguished Harvard professors had for the system that required them to travel to the Radcliffe campus to teach the small female classes after teaching the same lecture to their male students at Harvard.[5] However, by 1946 most classes were coeducational and taught by Harvard professors.[3] For a brief period, Ruth was interested in pursuing a degree in Philosophy and Physics, and even though she was never explicitly told not to go into Physics, she got the feeling that she was not welcome. She attributes this feeling of unease to the time that she took a coeducational Physics course in which she was only one of two women in the class of 350 students.[2][3] Ruth finally settled on biochemical sciences, and in 1944 graduated from Radcliffe College with a B.A. in biochemical sciences.[7]/nOut of a desire to help the Allied War effort in World War II, Ruth joined the laboratory of George Wald, where they conducted research on infrared vision. She briefly relocated to Chattanooga where her first husband Frank Hubbard was stationed. When the war ended, they returned to Cambridge. Ruth returned to Radcliffe in 1946 in pursuit of her doctorate in biology.[2] She was awarded a predoctoral fellowship by the U.S. Public Health Service in 1948, allowing her to study at the University College Hospital Medical School in London. Ruth received her PhD in biology in 1950.[7]/nAfter receiving her PhD from Harvard, Ruth became a research fellow. She worked under George Wald, investigating the biochemistry of retinal and retinol.[8] According to an interview given by Ruth, together they built on the work that Wald had researched during a fellowship following his own doctorate degree. He had confirmed the long-held belief that vitamin A was related to vision. Not only did he find that light absorption liberated vitamin A, he also found an intermediate of the visual pigment rhodopsin and vitamin A. This intermediate was the base of Ruth\u2019s early work, where she attempted to determine the chemistry of the rhodopsin cycle.[9] In 1952, Ruth received a Guggenheim Fellowship at the Carlsberg Laboratory in Copenhagen, Denmark.[7] Wald shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1967 for his discoveries about how the eye works.[9] In the same year, the pair was awarded the Paul Karrer Gold Medal specifically for their work with rhodopsin.[5]/nHubbard made many important contributions to the visual sciences but her single most important contribution was the fact that visual excitation is initiated by a chemical rearrangement of the visual pigment (rhodopsin) which is called a cis-trans isomerization.[10][11][12][13] She showed that this is the only direct action of light on the visual system.[13][11]  She also identified the specific intermediate in the visual cycle (called metarhodopsin2) that leads to downstream effects, that culminate in a light-activated neural signaling to the brain[13][14][15]  Hubbard also described the bleaching and resynthesis of the rhodopsin molecule each time a photon is absorbed.[16][17][18][19] She also discovered retinene isomerase (now called RPE65) that converts all-trans retinal (the post-illumination form) back into 11-cis retinal. She also studied the visual pigments in several new species.[20][21][22] Her early work focused on the basic properties of rhodopsin, which is a combination of the chromophore (retinal) and a protein called opsin, which is reutilized in the resynthesis of rhodopsin. Hubbard published at least 31 scientific papers devoted to vision./nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Hubbard became interested in social and political dimensions of biological issues. In her book The Politics of Women's Biology, she wrote that she had been a \"devout scientist\" from 1947 until the late 1960s, but the Vietnam War and the women's liberation movement led her to change her priorities./nHubbard describes an instance where she was working with squid as one of the pivotal moments where her interests shifted from scientific research to social relevance. Despite working with squid, cattle, and frogs for years when researching the complexities of vision, at that instant it suddenly began to bother her. She said, \u201cI began to have the feeling that nothing I could find out was worth killing another squid.\u201d[2]/nAround the same time in the late 1960s, as a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Ruth was asked to give a talk about being a female in the sciences. While conducting interviews of her fellow female scientists, Hubbard discovered that they were all in similar situations. Each of the women were accomplished in their fields, yet none of them had real jobs.[2] They all had what Ruth called \u201cnonjobs.\u201d They had titles such as lecturer or associate which meant they had little to no job security, while their male-counterparts were either on the path to professorships or had already received tenure.[9] This led Ruth and others to join a group that petitioned Harvard to reevaluate the job statuses of its female faculty. Ruth Hubbard was the first woman to be offered a tenured Harvard professorship in the Biology Department in 1973.[2]/nAfter being promoted in 1973 from what she called the \"typical women's ghetto\" of \"research associate and lecturer\" positions to a tenured faculty position at Harvard, she felt increased freedom to pursue new interests.[23]/nOne such interest manifested itself in the new seminar course she taught at Harvard titled \u201cBiology 109 - Biology and Women\u2019s Issues.\u201d[3] The class looked at the role of women in science and how the absence of women in scientific fields had affected the scientific questions that were asked.[5]/nIn the late 1980s and 1990s, Ruth gave several interviews challenging the power structure in STEM fields. What constitutes science, she told the Globe in 1990, usually is decided by \u201ca self-perpetuating, self-reflexive group: by the chosen for the chosen,\u201d and those \u201cchosen\u201d historically were upper-class white men.[24] \u201cWomen and nonwhite, working-class and poor men have largely been outside the process of science-making,\u201d Dr. Hubbard told The New York Times in 1981. \u201cThough we have been described by scientists, by and large we have not been the describers and definers of scientific reality. We have not formulated the questions scientists ask, nor have we answered them. This undoubtedly has affected the content of science, but it has also affected the social context and the ambience in which science is done.\u201d[25]/nShe became known as a strong critic of sociobiology. Geneticist Richard Lewontin has said, \"No one has been a more influential critic of the biological theory of women's inequality than Ruth Hubbard.\"[26] In a 2006 essay entitled \"Race and Genes,\" she wrote:/nIt is beyond comprehension, in this century which has witnessed holocausts of ethnic, racial, and religious extermination in many parts of our planet, perpetrated by peoples of widely different cultural and political affiliations and beliefs, that educated persons\u2014scholars and popularizers alike\u2014can come forward to argue, as though in complete innocence and ignorance of our recent history, that nothing could be more interesting and worthwhile than to sort out the \"racial\" or \"ethnic\" components of our thoroughly mongrelized species so as to ascertain the root identity of each and everyone of us. And where to look for that identity if not in our genes?[27]/nRuth also became a critic of recombinant DNA research, in a time when the field was booming. She was concerned that people were attempting to assign every trait, disease, and behavior a genetic cause, leading to an oversimplification of science which does not consider the complexities of nature and outside factors. She termed this craze \u201cgenomania.\u201d[3] She was also worried about the safeguards surrounding such research. In a letter published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Hubbard stated that if an epidemic caused by a recombinant organism were to break out, it would be almost impossible to distinguish it from the natural E. coli strains that humans are already exposed to.[28]/nIn her essay \"Science and Science Criticism,\" published in 2001 as a chapter of The Gender and Science Reader, Hubbard iterates that she is a scientist and states that \"[n]ature is part of history and culture\", but not vice versa. She goes on to say that scientists are largely unable to grasp the concept of nature being part of life--- noting how she needed several years to understand the statement. Going into her scientific history, the narrator mentions how she originally never questioned how her efforts fit into society. Narrowing her focus, she exposits that the Vietnam-era women's rights  and women's liberation movements helped teach her of the roles of science in society.[29]/nShe continues forth with the various means of debate for both sides. One notable instance from men is when they revive various old and unfounded biological theories on women to justify the typical subservient positions of the female gender. Hubbard even refers to the means of debate as \"breathing new life\" into old theories and assumptions. She further exposits the issues revolving around gender equality that were mainly brought to her attention by how she and her colleagues suddenly started getting promoted from their \"ghetto\" lab positions right into proper titles. She promptly stresses that \"[she believes] the subject of women's biology is profoundly political\", explaining away the book's title as she does so. Proceeding onward her desire to go beyond \"defining [women as a whole] as victims of male power and dominance,\" and pushes for women everywhere to show independence and individuality while learning to accept and embrace the biology that's continuously used by men to undermine them. To follow up, she goes on to talk about women's health activists re-educating women on the functions of their body and goes on to encourage women to use the re-education to attain great power by eliminating the footholds of male misinformation and misrepresentation of their bodies.[29]/nThe essay asserts that women scientists must ultimately and paradoxically turn away from the sciences to make their stand against male supremacy as opposed to the many female and feminist poets, novelists, and artists that can illustrate their points clearly and easily. She notes that politics seems to vanish within the sciences, exemplifying this point by noting social classes aren't a specific category listed under US health studies. The point she makes is that social and political realities can be blended or integrated subtly into all mediums. The subtlety of the integration ultimately creates great difficulty in discerning fact from prejudice. In addition, artists, novelists, and poets can compose their works without being victim to review under the funding agencies that makes the use of scientific fact tedious and less effective. The author leads in to surmise that the issues around women's rights must be raised and brought into public focus. After bringing up how science integrates itself into culture, she exemplifies the point by noting the prominence of biological terms in historical terminology and alluringly points out a biologist's tendency to place humanity above all other animals--- not unlike how men view women and their desire for equality. She raises the question of whether or not women can improve the sciences but makes an attempt to bring into attention her belief that women can make an impact. Hubbard closes by saying that scientists never want their work to be forgotten and lost, and that she sides with feminism for political insight and analytic testing on the scientific assumptions about women.[29]/nRuth Hubbard was married to WWII GI and fellow Harvard graduate Frank Hubbard in 1942.[7] Ruth fondly remembered the months that the pair spent traveling via motorcycle across Europe as Frank researched harpsichords. The couple divorced in 1951.[30]/nRuth had met her second husband, George Wald, while they were both at Harvard. Wald was a Professor of Biology and Ruth\u2019s boss in the research lab. However, the two began and kept their love affair a secret for more than a decade since they were married to other people at the time. After their respective divorces to previous partners, Ruth and George married in 1958.[30] The couple had two children: a son, musician and music historian Elijah Wald, and a daughter, attorney Deborah Wald.[8] Hubbard would go on to publish a book, Exploding the Gene Myth, with her son Elijah.[24]/nBoth Ruth and her brother Alexander followed in the footsteps of their activist parents. Alexander Hoffman was a well-known lawyer and activist. Some of his high-profile clients included Cesar Chavez, Lenny Bruce, and multiple members of the Black Panther Party.[31] Like her brother, Ruth Hubbard was an outspoken activist. However, she was not only known for her commentary on science in society but was also as an antiwar and antinuclear war activist, for which she was once arrested on charges of civil disobedience.[24]/nLike her second husband, Ruth remained scientifically active until about 1975, and she made an excellent scientific presentation of George Wald's work at a symposium in his honor.

Among his foremost achievements were finding a cure for syphilis in 1909 and inventing the precursor technique to Gram staining bacteria. The methods he developed for staining tissue made it possible to distinguish between different types of blood cells, which led to the ability to diagnose numerous blood diseases./nHis laboratory discovered arsphenamine (Salvarsan), the first effective medicinal treatment for syphilis, thereby initiating and also naming the concept of chemotherapy. Ehrlich popularized the concept of a magic bullet. He also made a decisive contribution to the development of an antiserum to combat diphtheria and conceived a method for standardizing therapeutic serums.[1]/nIn 1908, he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his contributions to immunology.[2] He was the founder and first director of what is now known as the Paul Ehrlich Institute, a German research institution and medical regulatory body that is the nation's federal institute for vaccines and biomedicines. A genus of Rickettsiales bacteria, Ehrlichia, is named after him.[3]/nEhrlich has been called \"father of immunology.\"[4][5]/nEhrlich was born 14 March 1854 in Strehlen in the Prussian province of Lower Silesia in what is now south-west Poland.  He was the second child of Rosa (Weigert) and Ismar Ehrlich, the leader of the local Jewish community.[2] His father was an innkeeper and distiller of liqueurs and the royal lottery collector in Strehlen, a town of some 5,000 inhabitants. His grandfather, Heymann Ehrlich, had been a fairly successful distiller and tavern manager. Ehrlich was the uncle of Fritz Weigert and cousin of Karl Weigert./nAfter elementary school, Paul attended the time-honored secondary school Maria-Magdalenen-Gymnasium in Breslau, where he met Albert Neisser, who later became a professional colleague. As a schoolboy (inspired by his cousin Karl Weigert who owned one of the first microtomes), he became fascinated by the process of staining microscopic tissue substances. He retained that interest during his subsequent medical studies at the universities of Wroclaw, Strasbourg, Freiburg im Breisgau and Leipzig. After obtaining his doctorate in 1882, he worked at the Charit\u00e9 in Berlin as an assistant medical director under Theodor Frerichs, the founder of experimental clinical medicine, focusing on histology, hematology and color chemistry (dyes)./nHe married Hedwig Pinkus (1864\u20131948) in 1883 in the synagogue in Neustadt (now Prudnik, Poland). The couple had two daughters, Stephanie and Marianne. Hedwig was a sister of Max Pinkus, who was an owner of the textile factory in Neustadt (later known as ZPB \"Frotex\"). He settled in the villa of the Fr\u00e4nkel family on Wiesenerstrasse in Neustadt.[6]/nAfter completing his clinical education and habilitation at the prominent Charit\u00e9 medical school and teaching hospital in Berlin in 1886, Ehrlich traveled to Egypt and other countries in 1888 and 1889, in part to cure a case of tuberculosis which he had contracted in the laboratory. Upon his return he established a private medical practice and small laboratory in Berlin-Steglitz. In 1891, Robert Koch invited Ehrlich to join the staff at his Berlin Institute of Infectious Diseases, where in 1896 a new branch, the Institute for Serum Research and Testing (Institut f\u00fcr Serumforschung und Serumpr\u00fcfung), was established for Ehrlich's specialization. Ehrlich was named its founding director./nIn 1899 his institute moved to Frankfurt am Main and was renamed the Institute of Experimental Therapy (Institut f\u00fcr experimentelle Therapie). One of his important collaborators there was Max Neisser. In 1904, Ehrlich received a full position of honorary professor from the University of G\u00f6ttingen. In 1906 Ehrlich became the director of the Georg Speyer House in Frankfurt, a private research foundation affiliated with his institute. Here he discovered in 1909 the first drug to be targeted against a specific pathogen: Salvarsan, a treatment for syphilis, which was at that time one of the most lethal and infectious diseases in Europe. In 1914, Ehrlich was awarded the Cameron Prize of the University of Edinburgh. Among the foreign guest scientists working with Ehrlich at his institute were two Nobel Prize winners, Henry Hallett Dale and Paul Karrer. The institute was renamed Paul Ehrlich Institute in Ehrlich's honour in 1947./nIn 1914, Ehrlich signed the Manifesto of the Ninety-Three which was a defense of Germany's World War I politics and militarism. On 17 August 1915 Ehrlich suffered a heart attack and died on 20 August in Bad Homburg vor der H\u00f6he. Wilhelm II the German emperor, wrote in a telegram of condolence, \"I, along with the entire civilized world, mourn the death of this meritorious researcher for his great service to medical science and suffering humanity; his life\u2019s work ensures undying fame and the gratitude of both his contemporaries and posterity\".[7]/nPaul Ehrlich was buried at the Old Jewish Cemetery, Frankfurt (Block 114 N).[8]/nIn the early 1870s, Ehrlich's cousin Karl Weigert was the first person to stain bacteria with dyes and to introduce aniline pigments for histological studies and bacterial diagnostics. During his studies in Strassburg under the anatomist Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer, Ehrlich continued the research started by his cousin in pigments and staining tissues for microscopic study. He spent his eighth university semester in Freiburg im Breisgau investigating primarily the red dye dahlia (monophenylrosanilin), giving rise to his first publication.[9]/nIn 1878 he followed his dissertation supervisor Julius Friedrich Cohnheim to Leipzig, and that year obtained a doctorate with a dissertation entitled \"Contributions to the Theory and Practice of Histological Staining\" (Beitr\u00e4ge zur Theorie und Praxis der histologischen F\u00e4rbung)./nOne of the most outstanding results of his dissertation investigations was the discovery of a new cell type. Ehrlich discovered in the protoplasm of supposed plasma cells a granulate which could be made visible with the help of an alkaline dye. He thought this granulate was a sign of good nourishment, and accordingly named these cells mast cells, (from the German word for an animal-fattening feed, Mast). This focus on chemistry was unusual for a medical dissertation. In it, Ehrlich presented the entire spectrum of known staining techniques and the chemistry of the pigments employed.\nWhile he was at the Charit\u00e9, Ehrlich elaborated upon the differentiation of white blood cells according to their different granules. A precondition was a dry specimen technique, which he also developed. A drop of blood placed between two glass slides and heated over a Bunsen burner fixed the blood cells while still allowing them to be stained. Ehrlich used both alkaline and acid dyes, and also created new \"neutral\" dyes. For the first time this made it possible to differentiate the lymphocytes among the leucocytes (white blood cells). By studying their granulation he could distinguish between nongranular lymphocytes, mono- and poly-nuclear leucocytes, eosinophil granulocytes, and mast cells./nStarting in 1880, Ehrlich also studied red blood cells. He demonstrated the existence of nucleated red blood cells, which he subdivided into normoblasts, megaloblasts, microblasts and poikiloblasts; he had discovered the precursors of erythrocytes. Ehrlich thus also laid the basis for the analysis of anemias, after he had created the basis for systematizing leukemias with his investigation of white blood cells./nHis duties at the Charit\u00e9 included analyzing patients' blood and urine specimens. In 1881 he published a new urine test which could be used to distinguish various types of typhoid from simple cases of diarrhea. The intensity of staining made possible a disease prognosis. The pigment solution he used is known today as Ehrlich's reagent.\nEhrlich's great achievement, but also a source of problems during his further career, was that he had initiated a new field of study interrelating chemistry, biology and medicine. Much of his work was rejected by the medical profession, which lacked the requisite chemical knowledge. It also meant that there was no suitable professorship in sight for Ehrlich./nWhen a student in Breslau, Ehrlich was given an opportunity by the pathologist Julius Friedrich Cohnheim to conduct extensive research and was also introduced to Robert Koch, who was at the time a district physician in Wollstein, Posen Province. In his spare time, Koch had clarified the life cycle of the anthrax pathogen and had contacted Ferdinand Cohn, who was quickly convinced by Koch's work and introduced him to his Breslau colleagues. From 30 April to 2 May 1876, Koch presented his investigations in Breslau, which the student Paul Ehrlich was able to attend./nOn 24 March 1882, Ehrlich was present when Robert Koch, working since 1880 at the Imperial Public Health Office (Kaiserliches Gesundheitsamt) in Berlin, presented the lecture in which he reported how he was able to identify the tuberculosis pathogen. Ehrlich later described this lecture as his \"greatest experience in science\". The day after Koch's lecture, Ehrlich had already made an improvement to Koch's staining method, which Koch unreservedly welcomed. From this date on, the two men were bound in friendship./nIn 1887 Ehrlich became an unsalaried lecturer in internal medicine (Privatdozent f\u00fcr Innere Medizin) at Berlin University, and in 1890 took over the tuberculosis station at a public hospital in Berlin-Moabit at Koch's request. This was where Koch's hoped-for tuberculosis therapeutic agent tuberculin was under study; and Ehrlich had even injected himself with it. In the ensuing tuberculin scandal, Ehrlich tried to support Koch and stressed the value of tuberculin for diagnostic purposes. In 1891 Koch invited Ehrlich to work at the newly founded Institute of Infectious Diseases (Institut f\u00fcr Infektionskrankheiten \u2013 now the Robert Koch Institute)[10] at Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t (now Humboldt University) in Berlin. Koch was unable to give him any remuneration, but did offer him full access to laboratory staff, patients, chemicals and laboratory animals, which Ehrlich always remembered with gratitude./nEhrlich had started his first experiments on immunization already in his private laboratory. He accustomed mice to the poisons ricin and abrin. After feeding them with small but increasing dosages of ricin he ascertained that they had become \"ricin-proof\". Ehrlich interpreted this as immunization and observed that it was abruptly initiated after a few days and was still in existence after several months, but mice immunized against ricin were just as sensitive to abrin as untreated animals./nThis was followed by investigations on the \"inheritance\" of acquired immunity. It was already known that in some cases after a smallpox or syphilis infection, specific immunity was transmitted from the parents to their offspring. Ehrlich rejected inheritance in the genetic sense because the offspring of a male mouse immunized against abrin and an untreated female mouse were not immune to abrin. He concluded that the fetus was supplied with antibodies via the pulmonary circulation of the mother. This idea was supported by the fact that this \"inherited immunity\" decreased after a few months. In another experiment he exchanged the offspring of treated and untreated female mice. The mice which were nursed by the treated females were protected from the poison, providing the proof that antibodies can also be conveyed in milk./nEhrlich also researched autoimmunity, but he specifically rejected the possibility that an organism's immune system could attack the organism's own tissue calling it \"horror autotoxicus\". It was Ehrlich's student, Ernest Witebsky, who demonstrated that autoimmunity could cause disease in humans.[11][12] Ehrlich was the first to propose that regulatory mechanisms existed to protect an organism from autoimmunity, saying in 1906 that \"the organism possesses certain contrivances by means of which the immunity reaction, so easily produced by all kinds of cells, is prevented from acting against the organism's own elements\".[13]/nEmil Behring had worked at the Berlin Institute of Infectious Diseases until 1893 on developing an antiserum for treating diphtheria and tetanus but with inconsistent results. Koch suggested that Behring and Ehrlich cooperate on the project. This joint work was successful to the extent that Ehrlich was quickly able to increase the level of immunity of the laboratory animals based on his experience with mice. Clinical tests with diphtheria serum early in 1894 were successful and in August the chemical company Hoechst started to market Behring's \"Diphtheria Remedy synthesized by Behring-Ehrlich\". The two discoverers had originally agreed to share any profits after the Hoechst share had been subtracted. Their contract was changed several times and finally Ehrlich was eventually pressured into accepting a profit share of only eight percent. Ehrlich resented what he considered as unfair treatment, and his relationship with Behring was thereafter problematic, a situation which later escalated over the issue of the valency[14] of tetanus serum. Ehrlich recognized that the principle of serum therapy had been developed by Behring and Kitasato. But he was of the opinion that he had been the first to develop a serum which could also be used on humans, and that his role in developing the diphtheria serum had been insufficiently acknowledged. Behring, for his part, schemed against Ehrlich at the Prussian Ministry of Culture, and from 1900 on Ehrlich refused to collaborate with him. von Behring was the sole recipient of the first Nobel Prize in Medicine, in 1901, for contributions to research on diphtheria.[15]/nSince antiserums were an entirely new type of medicine whose quality was highly variable, a government system was established to guarantee their safety and effectiveness. Beginning 1 April 1895, only government-approved serum could be sold in the German Reich. The testing station for diphtheria serum was provisionally housed at the Institute of Infectious Diseases. At the initiative of Friedrich Althoff,[16] an Institute of Serum Research and Testing (Institut f\u00fcr Serumforschung und Serumpr\u00fcfung) was established in 1896 in Berlin-Steglitz, with Paul Ehrlich as director (which required him to cancel all his contracts with Hoechst). In this function and as honorary professor at Berliner University he had annual earnings of 6,000 marks, approximately the salary of a university professor. In addition to a testing department the institute also had a research department./nIn order to determine the effectiveness of diphtheria antiserum, a stable concentration of diphtheria toxin was required. Ehrlich discovered that the toxin being used was perishable, in contrast to what had been assumed, which for him led to two consequences: He did not use the toxin as a standard, but instead a serum powder developed by Behring, which had to be dissolved in liquid shortly before use. The strength of a test toxin was first determined in comparison with this standard. The test toxin could then be used as a reference for testing other serums. For the test itself, toxin and serum were mixed in a ratio so that their effects just cancelled each other when injected into a guinea pig. But since there was a large margin in determining whether symptoms of illness were present, Ehrlich established an unambiguous target: the death of the animal. The mixture was to be such that the test animal would die after four days. If it died earlier, the serum was too weak and was rejected. Ehrlich claimed to have made the determination of the valency of serum as accurate as it would be with chemical titration. This again demonstrates his tendency to quantify the life sciences./nInfluenced by the mayor of Frankfurt am Main, Franz Adickes, who endeavored to establish science institutions in Frankfurt in preparation of the founding of a university, Ehrlich's institute moved to Frankfurt in 1899 and was renamed the Royal Prussian Institute of Experimental Therapy (K\u00f6niglich Preu\u00dfisches Institut f\u00fcr Experimentelle Therapie). The German quality-control methodology was copied by government serum institutes all over the world, and they also obtained the standard serum from Frankfurt. After diphtheria antiserum, tetanus serum and various bactericide serums for use in veterinary medicine were developed in rapid sequence. These were also evaluated at the institute, as was tuberculin and later on various vaccines. Ehrlich's most important colleague at the institute was the Jewish doctor and biologist Julius Morgenroth./nHe postulated that cell protoplasm contains special structures which have chemical side chains (today's term is macromolecules) to which the toxin binds, affecting function. If the organism survives the effects of the toxin, the blocked side-chains are replaced by new ones. This regeneration can be trained, the name for this phenomenon being immunization. If the cell produces a surplus of side chains, these might also be released into the blood as antibodies./nIn the following years Ehrlich expanded his side chain theory using concepts (\"amboceptors\", \"receptors of the first, second and third order\", etc.) which are no longer customary. Between the antigen and the antibody he assumed there was an additional immune molecule, which he called an \"additive\" or a \"complement\". For him, the side chain contained at least two functional groups./nFor providing a theoretical basis for immunology as well as for his work on serum valency, Ehrlich was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1908 together with \u00c9lie Metchnikoff. Metchnikoff, who had researched the cellular branch of immunity, Phagocytosis, at the Pasteur Institute had previously sharply attacked Ehrlich./nIn 1901, the Prussian Ministry of Finance criticized Ehrlich for exceeding his budget and as a consequence reduced his income. In this situation Althoff arranged a contact with Georg Speyer, a Jewish philanthropist and joint owner of the bank house Lazard Speyer-Ellissen. The cancerous disease of Princess Victoria, the widow of the German Emperor Friedrich II, had received much public attention and prompted a collection among wealthy Frankfurt citizens, including Speyer, in support of cancer research. Ehrlich had also received from the German Emperor Wilhelm II a personal request to devote all his energy to cancer research. Such efforts led to the founding of a department for cancer research affiliated with the Institute of Experimental Therapy. The chemist Gustav Embden, among others, worked there. Ehrlich informed his sponsors that cancer research meant basic research, and that a cure could not be expected soon./nAmong the results achieved by Ehrlich and his research colleagues was the insight that when tumors are cultivated by transplanting tumor cells, their malignancy increases from generation to generation. If the primary tumor is removed, then metastasis precipitously increases. Ehrlich applied bacteriological methods to cancer research. In analogy to vaccination, he attempted to generate immunity to cancer by injecting weakened cancer cells. Both in cancer research and chemotherapy research (see below) he introduced the methodologies of Big Science./nIn 1885 Ehrlich's monograph \"The Need of the Organism for Oxygen\" (Das Sauerstoffbed\u00fcrfnis des Organismus \u2013 Eine farbenanalytische Studie) appeared, which he also submitted as a habilitation thesis. In it he introduced the new technology of in vivo staining. One of his findings was that pigments can only be easily assimilated by living organisms if they are in granular form. He injected the dyes alizarin blue and indophenol blue into laboratory animals and established after their death that various organs had been colored to different degrees. In organs with high oxygen saturation, indophenol was retained; in organs with medium saturation, indophenol was reduced, but not alizarin blue. And in areas with low oxygen saturation, both pigments were reduced. With this work, Ehrlich also formulated the conviction which guided his research: that all life processes can be traced to processes of physical chemistry occurring in the cell./nIn the course of his investigations Ehrlich came across methylene blue, which he regarded as particularly suitable for staining bacteria. Later, Robert Koch also used methylene blue as a dye in his research on the tuberculosis pathogen. In Ehrlich's view, an added benefit was that methylene blue also stained the long appendages of nerve cells, the axons. He initiated a doctoral dissertation on the subject, but did not follow up the topic himself. It was the opinion of the neurologist Ludwig Edinger that Ehrlich had thereby opened up a major new topic in the field of neurology./nAfter mid-1889, when Ehrlich was unemployed, he privately continued his research on methylene blue. His work on in vivo staining gave him the idea of using it therapeutically. Since the parasite family of Plasmodiidae \u2013 which includes the malaria pathogen \u2013 can be stained with methylene blue, he thought it could possibly be used in the treatment of malaria. In the case of two patients so treated at the city hospital in Berlin-Moabit, their fever indeed subsided and the malaria plasmodia disappeared from their blood. Ehrlich obtained methylene blue from the company Meister Lucius & Br\u00fcning AG (later renamed Hoechst AG), which started a long collaboration with this company./nBefore the Institute of Experimental Therapy had moved to Frankfurt, Ehrlich had already resumed work on methylene blue. After the death of Georg Speyer, his widow Franziska Speyer endowed the Georg-Speyer House in his memory[17] which was erected next door to Ehrlich's institute. As director of the Georg-Speyer House, Ehrlich transferred his chemotherapeutic research there. He was looking for an agent which was as effective as methylene blue, but without its side effects. His model was on the one hand the impact of quinine on malaria, and on the other hand, in analogy to serum therapy, he thought there must also be chemical pharmaceuticals which would have just as specific an effect on individual diseases. His goal was to find a \"Therapia sterilisans magna\", in other words a treatment that could kill all disease pathogens./nAs a model for experimental therapy Ehrlich used a guinea pig disease trypanosoma and tested out various chemical substances on laboratory animals. The trypanosomes could indeed be successfully killed with the dye trypan red. Beginning in 1906, he intensively investigated atoxyl and had it tested by Robert Koch along with other arsenic compounds during Koch's sleeping sickness expedition of 1906/07. Although the name literally means \"nonpoisonous\", atoxyl does cause damage, especially to the optic nerve. Ehrlich elaborated the systematic testing of chemical compounds in the sense of screening as now practiced in the pharmaceutical industry. He discovered that Compound 418 - Arsenophenylglycine - had an impressive therapeutic effect and had it tested in Africa./nWith the support of his assistant Sahachiro Hata Ehrlich discovered in 1909 that Compound 606, Arsphenamine, effectively combatted \"spirillum\" spirochaetes bacteria, one of whose subspecies causes syphilis.[18] The compound proved to have few side effects in human trials, and the spirochetes disappeared in seven syphilis patients after this treatment./nAfter extensive clinical testing (all the research participants had the negative example of tuberculin in mind) the Hoechst company began to market the compound toward the end of 1910 under the name Salvarsan. This was the first agent with a specific therapeutic effect to be created on the basis of theoretical considerations. Salvarsan proved to be amazingly effective, particularly when compared with the conventional therapy of mercury salts. Manufactured by Hoechst AG, Salvarsan became the most widely prescribed drug in the world. It was the most effective drug for treating syphilis until penicillin became available in the 1940s.[19] Salvarsan required improvement as to side effects and solubility and was replaced in 1911 with Neosalvarsan. Ehrlich's work illuminated the existence of the blood-brain barrier, although he himself never believed in such a barrier, with Lina Stern later coining the phrase./nThe medication triggered the so-called \"Salvarsan war\". On one side there was hostility on the part of those who feared a resulting moral breakdown of sexual inhibitions. Ehrlich was also accused, with clearly anti-Semitic undertones, of excessively enriching himself. In addition, Ehrlich's associate, Paul Uhlenhuth claimed priority in discovering the drug./nBecause some people died during the clinical testing, Ehrlich was accused of \"stopping at nothing.\" In 1914, one of the most prominent accusers was convicted of criminal libel at a trial for which Ehrlich was called to testify. Though Ehrlich was thereby exonerated, the ordeal threw him into a depression from which he never fully recovered.[20]/nEhrlich reasoned that if a compound could be made that selectively targeted a disease-causing organism, then a toxin for that organism could be delivered along with the agent of selectivity. Hence, a \"magic bullet\" (Zauberkugel, his term for an ideal therapeutic agent) would be created that killed only the organism targeted. The concept of a \"magic bullet\" has to some extent been realized by the development of antibody-drug conjugates (a monoclonal antibody linked to a cytotoxic biologically active drug), as they enable cytotoxic drugs to be selectively delivered to their designated targets (e.g. cancer cells)./nIn 1910, a street was named after Ehrlich in Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen. In Nazi Germany, Ehrlich's achievements were ignored while Emil Adolf von Behring was stylized as the ideal Aryan scientist, and the street named after Ehrlich was given another name. Shortly after the end of the war the name Paul-Ehrlich-Strasse was reinstated, and today numerous German cities have streets named after Paul Ehrlich./nWest Germany issued a postage stamp in 1954 on the 100th anniversary of the births of Paul Ehrlich (14 March 1854) and Emil von Behring (15 March 1854)./nThe 200 Deutsche Mark bank note, issued until 2001, featured Paul Ehrlich./nThe German Paul Ehrlich Institute, the successor to the Steglitz Institute for Serum Research and Serum Testing and the Frankfurt Royal Institute for Experimental Therapy, was named in 1947 after its first director, Paul Ehrlich.[21]/nHis name is also borne by many schools and pharmacies, by the Paul-Ehrlich-Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Chemotherapie e. V. (PEG) in Frankfurt am Main, and the Paul-Ehrlich-Klinik in Bad Homburg vor der H\u00f6he. The Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize is the most distinguished German award for biomedical research. A European network of PhD studies in Medicinal Chemistry has been named after him (Paul Ehrlich MedChem Euro PhD Network).[22]/nThe Anti-Defamation League awards a Paul Ehrlich\u2013G\u00fcnther K. Schwerin Human Rights Prize./nA crater of the moon was named after Paul Ehrlich in 1970./nEhrlich's life and work was featured in the 1940 U.S. film Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet with Edward G. Robinson in the title role. It focused on Salvarsan (arsphenamine, \"compound 606\"), his cure for syphilis. Since the Nazi government was opposed to this tribute to a Jewish scientist, attempts were made to keep the film a secret in Germany. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.[23]", "1726946": "Frits Warmolt Went (May 18, 1903 \u2013 May 1, 1990) was a Dutch biologist whose 1928 experiment demonstrated the existence of auxin in plants./nWent's father was the prominent Dutch botanist Friedrich August Ferdinand Christian Went.  After graduating from the University of Utrecht, Holland in 1927 with a dissertation on the effects of the plant hormone auxin, Went then worked as a plant pathologist in the research labs of the Royal Botanical Garden in Buitenzorg, Dutch East Indies (now Bogor, Indonesia) from 1927 to 1933. He then took a position at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, California, first researching plant hormones.  His interest gradually shifted to environmental influences on plant growth.  At Caltech, he was among the first to demonstrate the importance of hormones in plant growth and development. He played an important role in the development of synthetic plant hormones, which then became the basis of much of the agricultural chemical industry./nFrees is known for the Cholodny\u2013Went model, named after Went and the Soviet scientist Nikolai Cholodny./nThey proposed it in 1937, after coming independently to the same conclusions.[1]\nThis is an early model describing the phototropic and gravitropic properties of emerging shoots of monocotyledons. It proposes that auxin, a plant growth hormone, is synthesized in the coleoptile tip, which senses light or gravity and will send the auxin down the appropriate side of the shoot. This causes asymmetric growth of one side of the plant. As a result, the plant shoot will begin to bend toward a light source or toward the surface.[citation needed]/nFunded by donors, Went constructed a series of greenhouses at Caltech in which he could vary light conditions, humidity, temperature, air quality and other variables.  In 1949 this led to him to construct a large new complex of climate-controlled rooms called the Earhart Plant Research Laboratory, also known as the \"phytotron.\"[2] Here he produced foundational research of the effects of air pollution on plant growth./nIn his 1960 article \"Blue Haze in the Atmosphere\" Went postulated the importance of biogenic volatile organic compounds emitted by forests for atmospheric new particle formation, which has been highly influential in the field of atmospheric chemistry. The blue haze is now known to be \nprimarily a result of light scattering on secondary organic aerosols, generated via the partitioning of volatile organic chemicals in the atmosphere after successive oxidation and hence reduction in vapor pressure./nIn 1958 Went was appointed director of the Missouri Botanical Garden and professor of botany at Washington University in St. Louis, at a point where he had become a world recognized authority on plant growth. He moved from Pasadena to St. Louis with his wife Catharina and their two children, Hans and Anneka.  After the opening of the Climatron, the world's first geodesic dome greenhouse, Went's vision of a renewed Missouri Botanical Garden eventually came into conflict with that of its board of trustees, and he resigned as director in 1963. After two years as professor of botany at Washington University, in 1965 he then became director of the Desert Research Institute at the University of Nevada, Reno, where he continued his research on desert plants for the remainder of his career, and on occasion lectured in the department of biology.

At age 13, he was seriously injured in a bazooka blast in the front yard of his childhood home in Yreka, California.[3] His left leg became gangrenous, and he lost 10\u00a0cm of his tibia, as well as the terminal digit of the middle finger on his right hand. Pianka's childhood injury left him with a short and partially paralyzed leg. In later life, his short leg resulted in spinal scoliosis and cervical spondylosis.[3]/nPianka graduated from Carleton College (B.A., 1960) and earned his Ph.D. from the University of Washington in 1965. He went on to do postdoctoral work with ecologist Robert MacArthur at Princeton University. This period, during which he worked closely with the temporarily studentless MacArthur, had a major influence on Pianka's thinking.[4] In 1966, with MacArthur, Pianka coauthored the paper, \"On optimal use of a patchy environment\".[5] Pianka frequently mentioned MacArthur in his lectures and kept a webpage for his deceased mentor and colleague.[6] In some ways, Pianka's own research program expands upon and continues the work that he and MacArthur began./nSince 1968, Pianka had been on the faculty of the University of Texas at Austin. His research centered on empirical and theoretical components of natural history, systematics, community and landscape ecology.[7]/nPianka had performed extensive ecological investigations on vertebrate communities in three desert systems on three continents: the Great Basin, Mojave, and Sonora Deserts in North America; the Kalahari in Africa; and the Great Victoria desert in Western Australia. His monographic treatment of this work is a landmark ecological synthesis (Pianka, 1986).[citation needed]/nPianka's latest work focused on lizard communities in Australia. His research projects included study of the phylogeny and ecology of a number of groups of Australian lizards and an extensive study of the unique biotic landscape produced by Australian brush fires.[8] His favorite lizard was a small Australian goanna, Varanus eremius.[9] In his research, Pianka combined traditional field biological methods with recent technological innovations in statistical analysis, phylogenetic reconstruction, and imaging of the Earth's surface in attempts to answer major questions about evolution and ecology./nPianka had trained other scientists and twelve of his former graduate students are professors at major universities, including Kirk Winemiller, a professor at Texas A&M University,[10] and Raymond Huey, a professor at the University of Washington.[11] Additionally, he taught a range of popular undergraduate courses; he received an award for excellence in teaching from UT Austin in 1999.[12]/nPianka's acceptance speech[13]  for the 2006 Distinguished Texas Scientist Award from the Texas Academy of Science[14] resulted in a controversy in the popular press when Forrest Mims, vice-chair of the Academy's section on environmental science, claimed that Pianka had \"enthusiastically advocated the elimination of 90 percent of Earth's population by airborne Ebola.\"[15] Mims claimed that Pianka said the Earth would not survive without drastic measures. Mims' affiliate at the Discovery Institute, William Dembski, then informed the Department of Homeland Security that Pianka's speech may have been intended to foment bioterrorism.[16][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] This resulted in the Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewing Pianka in Austin.[17]/nPianka has stated that Mims took his statements out of context and that he was simply describing what would happen from biological principles alone if present human population trends continue, and that he was not in any way advocating for it to happen.  The Texas Academy, which hosted the speech, released a statement asserting that \"Many of Dr. Pianka's statements have been severely misconstrued and sensationalized.\"[18] However, Kenneth Summy,[19] an Academy member who observed the speech, wrote a letter[20]  of support for Mims' account, saying \"Dr. Pianka chose to deliver an inflammatory message in his keynote address, so he should not be surprised to be the recipient of a lot of criticism from TAS membership. Forrest Mims did not misrepresent anything regarding the presentation.\"/nPianka appeared on NBC-affiliate KXAN Austin[21] and on two cable talk-shows and posted a statement on his University of Texas website that said in part:[22]/nI have two grandchildren and I want them to inherit a stable Earth. But I fear for them. Humans have overpopulated the Earth and in the process have created an ideal nutritional substrate on which bacteria and viruses (microbes) will grow and prosper. We are behaving like bacteria growing on an agar plate,[23] flourishing until natural limits are reached or until another microbe colonizes and takes over, using them as their resource. In addition to our extremely high population density, we are social and mobile, exactly the conditions that favor growth and spread of pathogenic (disease-causing) microbes. I believe it is only a matter of time until microbes once again assert control over our population, since we are unwilling to control it ourselves. This idea has been espoused by ecologists for at least four decades and is nothing new. People just don't want to hear it.\nI do not bear any ill will toward people. However, I am convinced that the world, including all humanity, WOULD clearly be much better off without so many of us. Simply stopping the destruction of rainforests would help mediate some current planetary ills, including the release of previously unknown pathogens.

By definition, these ways will not be ours and they won't be much fun. Think about that./nAs a consequence of the controversy, Pianka and members of the Texas Academy of Science received death threats.[24][25]  According to Pianka, his daughters were worried about his and their safety, and his life had been \"turned upside-down by 'right-wing fools'.\"[26]/nPianka was a 1978 Guggenheim Fellow, a 1981 American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellow, and a 1990 Fulbright Senior Research Scholar.

From an immigrant family, he earned early recognition for his experimental work in anatomy, and helped reform Romanian medical science. He spent much of his youth training himself in anatomical pathology and the various areas of natural science, gaining direct experience as a microbiologist, surgeon, and military physician. With teaching positions at the University of Ia\u0219i and the University of Bucharest, where he established specialized sections, Rainer became a noted promoter of science and an innovator in his field. He notably favored and introduced the anatomical study of \"functional structures\", and was in particular preoccupied with issues pertaining to ontogenesis and kinesiology. An intellectual influence on several generations of doctors, his wife was Marta Trancu-Rainer, Romania's first female surgeon./nIn addition to his experimental approach, Rainer is remembered as a talented pedagogue and public speaker, who took public stances in defense of his social and cultural ideals. Vilified by the far-right for his left-wing stances, he blended progressivism with genetic determinism, and, although an adept of eugenics, condemned scientific racism. He was notably involved with Dimitrie Gusti's project of rural sociology, contributing an anthropological record of several isolated villages on the Carpathian slopes. During his lifetime, Rainer also set up a large collection of craniums and skeletons, which became the centerpiece of his Bucharest anthropology department./nFrancisc Rainer was a native of Rohozna town, near Czernowitz, in Austrian-ruled Bukovina. His parents were Lutheran, but baptized their son Roman Catholic.[1] His father, Gustav Adolf Ignatz Rainer, emigrated to the Romanian Old Kingdom as an employee of the Strousberg Company that built the Bucharest-Giurgiu railway, the country's first. Remaining there, he obtained a post in the administration of the national railroad company.[2] His mother Maria (or Ana) came from a clerical family,[1] and was a housewife.[3] The boy received his primary education at home from his parents, later attending Saint Sava High School in Bucharest. Among the teachers who were particularly helpful was Sabba \u0218tef\u0103nescu in natural sciences.[4] Rainer read extensively, teaching himself Latin and Ancient Greek, and becoming passionate about the literary works of Goethe and the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. He slowly discarded the latter's influence when he discovered Heraclitus, Ernst Haeckel, and classical materialistic thought.[5] Such works diverted him from his original goal of becoming a Catholic missionary.[3]/nIn 1892, he enrolled in the medical faculty of the University of Bucharest. While still a student, Rainer was given important tasks by a professor in his histological laboratory. In 1896, he was named a junior teaching assistant in the medical clinic at Col\u021bea Hospital\u00a0[ro]; he remained there for nearly two decades.[6] During this time, troubled by \"the great issues of the Cosmos\", he imposed on himself a rigorous program of study and exercise (including cycling, mountaineering, and fencing).[7] Although struggling to make ends meet, Rainer deepened his anatomical research, closely studying human morphology, and experimented with examination techniques during autopsies, founding a Romanian Anatomical Society for the purpose of sharing results.[8] He also attended Anghel Saligny's lectures in chemistry at the School of Bridges, worked as a chemist in Constantin Istrati's lab, then as a pathologist at the Veterinary School.[9] He moved between Col\u021bea, Filaret\u00a0[ro], and the school of assistant surgeons, taking part in the campaign against tuberculosis.[10] In the summers of 1900 and 1901, he took part in an anti-cholera campaign in the Danube Delta, which also allowed him to study the native flora and fauna.[11]/nHe completed his doctorate in 1903, the topic being a particular form of cirrhosis. Having performed numerous autopsies at the hospital, he made an original discovery himself; at the end of the thesis committee's debate, two of its members, Dr. Stoicescu from Col\u021bea and Victor Babe\u0219, extended their collegial greetings to Rainer.[1] Aside from this pair, his professors included Alexandru Obregia\u00a0[ro], Nicolae Kalinderu\u00a0[ro], Thoma Ionescu\u00a0[ro], Gheorghe Marinescu, Ioan Cantacuzino, and Mina Minovici.[12] Also in 1903, Rainer, recently naturalized Romanian, married Marta Trancu, an Armenian Romanian doctor who had worked with him at Col\u021bea.[13] They had corresponded intensely on scientific and cultural subjects, before becoming romantically involved.[14] After completing her studies, Marta became Romania's first female surgeon.[15] Their only child, daughter Sofia, was born on in May 1904.[13][16]/nDuring that period, Rainer made two visits to Germany. The first, in 1906, involved work at Berlin's Frederick William University in the laboratories of Fedor Krause and Oscar Hertwig, as well as a study of embryology and comparative anatomy. His animal experiments there were primarily focused on the ossification process. At the anatomical institute led by Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer, he analyzed the brains of individuals belonging to different races.[17] The second visit, in 1911, involved a stop at the German Hygiene Museum in Dresden, at the anatomy institute of the University of Jena and at Leipzig. Near the trip's conclusion, while in Weimar, he visited Goethe's House.[18]/nUpon his return in 1912, Rainer became assistant professor at Bucharest.[1] The following year, with referrals from Constantin Ion Parhon,[19] he became chairman of the anatomy department at the University of Ia\u0219i medical faculty. Soon after his appointment, with the outbreak of the Second Balkan War, he was mobilized in the Romanian Land Forces medical service. He barely escaped with his life when his automobile fell off the pontoon bridge at Nikopol.[20] Upon his return, he busied himself with organizing his Ia\u0219i department, supplying the microscopes, microtomes, thermostats, magazine collections and a projector for the faculty.[21] Meanwhile, during this period, he was involved in scientific publication, sitting on the editorial board of Spitalul, writing for Romania Medical\u0103 and, in 1911, helping found the Paris-based Annales de Biologie.[22]/nAccording to Marta Rainer's own account, her husband's move to Ia\u0219i at age forty marked the end of a \"prolonged adolescence\", settling Rainer on the path to professional success.[23] As Rainer himself noted, teaching was a major responsibility: \"I have always held the belief that there is no feeling so great, no thought so vast and deep, that they may not reach out to young minds and hearts.\"[24] He set for himself the goal of answering to some of \"the great issues of mankind\", with \"a prolonged action to strengthen my spirit.\"[25] In his university lectures, Rainer taught that the purpose of medical science was human progress, \"that we may always reach for something that is set higher\".[26] He also held that \"each of us owes more to society than society owes us.\"[27]/nWhile in Ia\u0219i, Rainer joined the left-wing literary circle formed around Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 magazine, for which he contributed notes on medical science.[28] He befriended the group's doyen, Garabet Ibr\u0103ileanu, whom he treated for his lung problems. Rainer persuaded Ibr\u0103ileanu, who was Marta's cousin,[29] to hold courses in Romanian language and literature two evenings a week for medical students. His intention was to develop cultured doctors, and the students heard lectures by Mihail Sadoveanu, George Top\u00eerceanu and Titu Maiorescu.[30] He also took them for nature excursions so they could observe biological phenomena outside the laboratory.[31] Rainer himself traveled extensively after 1914: among his earliest trips was a working visit to Od\u00f3n de Buen's oceanographic institute in Palma de Mallorca.[32]/nIn 1916, following Romania's entry into World War I, Rainer returned to Bucharest and rejoined Marta, being called up for medical service as a colonel.[33] During the 1916 counteroffensive, the Rainers set up surgery wards in the hospitals that had become full to overflowing with wounded from the Battle of Turtucaia and the zeppelin attack on Bucharest.[34] Later, during Bucharest's occupation by the Central Powers, Francisc Rainer established temporary hospitals in schools. He continued teaching under the German administration, so that his students would not miss a year, but was also obliged to teach separate courses for German students. He managed to prevent the occupying authorities from requisitioning the faculty's possessions.[35] Viewed as political suspects, the Rainers were singled out for internment in Bulgaria, but spared by Minovici's intervention on his behalf.[36] Marta Rainer, who managed war hospitals, organized teams of surgeons to help deal with the humanitarian crisis, and operated non-stop during the extremely cold winter of 1917\u20131918.[37]/nFollowing Romania's withdrawal from the war, Rainer resumed his contacts with Romanian physicians stranded on unoccupied territory. His wartime work in experimental surgery attracted young men and women, including some of his former students at Ia\u0219i. They included Grigore T. Popa, who was selected for Rainer's permanent team during 1918.[38] Other early members were Florica Cern\u0103tescu (Popa's fianc\u00e9e) and Ilie Th. Riga.[39] By late 1918, Rainer was conceiving of an education reform, aiming to compress theoretical aspects and \"routine\" work while providing students with as much laboratory experience as possible. His ideas were received with skepticism by the physiologist Ioan Athanasiu, who stood for the classical approach.[40]/nFor a while in 1919, Rainer made a return to teaching in Ia\u0219i, where he also resumed his activity in the fight against tuberculosis.[41] After the Armistice of November signaled a worldwide return to peace, Rainer had to fend off allegations and angry students demonstrations, with allegations that he had been a turncoat and a collaborator of the Germans. During 1919, a commission of inquiry cleared his name, noting that he had displayed \"absolute loyalty\" to the legitimate Romanian government.[42] He himself vouched for his colleague Ecaterina Arbore, arrested for her revolutionary socialist militancy.[43] After the general strike of 1920 was broken up by the authorities, Rainer was part of the investigative commission which determined that the labor organizer Her\u0219cu Aroneanu had been beaten to death.[44]/nIn 1920, Rainer was employed by the new anatomy and embryology department set up at Bucharest University. Affected by deafness, attributed to his long-term exposure to formaldehyde, he continued to work at the same pace, but was noticeably withdrawn from public life.[45] The anatomy section existed only in name when Rainer took over. Rainer took personal charge of furnishing it, in the end setting up a large collection of craniums and full skeletons that earned the respect of Western colleagues such as Eug\u00e8ne Pittard,[46] Carleton S. Coon, Henri Victor Vallois, and Kurt Warnekros.[47] He was seconded by his devoted disciple and godson, the endocrinologist \u0218tefan Milcu (he eventually left Rainer's team in 1932, after developing an allergy to formaldehyde).[48] Other important presences among Rainer's students and collaborators were George Emil Palade[49][50] and Vintil\u0103 Cioc\u00e2lteu,[51] distinguished for their work in the United States. At various intervals, the team also included surgeon Ion \u021aurai, pharmacologist Alfred Teitel, embryologist Benedict M. Menke\u0219, and anatomist Zalman Iagnov.[50][52]/nAfter his move, Rainer began expanding the scope of his contribution, and passed on to his students a particular view of science, decisively materialistic, rationalist, and anti-metaphysical.[53] In particular, Rainer rejected the intuitionism of Henri Bergson, which had enjoyed a surge in popularity.[54] His intellectual heroes and models of researchers included Claude Bernard, Rudolf Virchow, and especially Goethe.[55] The physician and left-wing political figure Ion Vitner writes that Rainer's understanding of the human body, heavily influenced by the work of Wilhelm Roux, centered on \"life\", \"movement\", \"function\", and ultimately \"ontogenesis\", rather than on the \"static catalog\" of 19th-century anatomy.[56]/nThis worldview seeped into Rainer's research, which assumed the existence of a \"precise genetic program\" in man's somatic development.[57] He centered his attention on correlating the activities of various organs and their understanding as \"functional structures\".[58] This helped him and his students make groundbreaking discoveries in area such as the dura mater, cranial nerves, the lateral aortic lymph nodes, and the hypophyseal portal system.[59] In his study of spondylopathy, Rainer personally documented the existence of arthritis in the atlas.[60]/nPhysician I. Spielmann describes Rainer admiringly as a \"polyhistor\" with \"a passionate image of what truth is\".[61] According to a student, the historian of medicine Gheorghe Br\u0103tescu, Rainer was an outstanding pedagogue and public speaker, whose anatomy lessons were highly inspirational, but whose neglect for his public appearance could alienate young people.[62] As he writes: \"After showing us that medical science is one of observation, but that in practice it involves continuous experimentation, and why it is more of a craft that demands medical instinct, Rainer provided us with the one effective measure to sustain it: uninterrupted self-examination\".[63] Vitner also noted Rainer's preference for orality, attributing it to an \"extraordinary fear of the written word\".[64] Meanwhile, other specialists rejected Rainer's ideas and approach. According to anatomist Victor Papilian (whom Rainer had denounced as a plagiarist), Rainer's was \"a sterile and envious school\" of self-proclaimed \"geniuses\". According to Papilian, Rainer moved freely between subjects outside of his competence, including the paleontology of Leonardo da Vinci and the latest discoveries in astronomy.[65]/nDespite his progressive withdrawal from public life, Rainer was slowly being discovered as a public intellectual. In addition to his work at the university, he was again involved with Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103, and, from 1920, was one of the magazine's trustees.[66] He taught kinesiology at the Physical Education Institute, and artistic anatomy at the School of Fine Arts.[67] His lectures in anthropology, hosted by the Physical Education Institute from 1923, are believed to be the oldest form of anthropological education in Romania.[68] Also that year, Rainer made a noted contribution to biological anthropology, publishing his finds on the medieval princely remains dug up in Curtea de Arge\u0219.[69] He pursued other such investigations into the Romanian past, including the craniometry of Michael the Brave and the description of ancient tombs dug up at Turnu Severin.[70]/nPursuing her own career in Bucharest hospitals, Marta was later a personal physician of Helen of Greece, wife of King Carol II of Romania.[71] In their personal life, the Rainers experienced disappointment: having received her education in Romania, Sofia Rainer left for England, to attend the University of Bristol; she grew estranged from the family after her marriage to an Englishman, Archibald Philip Laing Gordon.[37]/nRainer's views eventually placed him at odds with the emerging far-right and antisemitic movement of the 1920s. At a time when the Ia\u0219i-based National-Christian Defense League (LANC), seeking to purge Jews from Romanian universities, was gaining momentum in Bucharest, a student identified Rainer as a Jew, and issued claims denying merit to his scholarship.[65] According to Vitner, Rainer was the diametrical opposite of a Ia\u0219i rival, the racist and LANC affiliate Nicolae Paulescu, who stood for \"dark and backward scientism\".[72] Vitner also recalls that Rainer was even shot at by far-right affiliates, so that he would no longer popularize his \"democratic convictions\".[73] For a while, Rainer was under the permanent protection of a Gendarme guard.[65]/nNevertheless, Rainer was himself an active proponent of \"hereditary determinism\" and eugenics, which he understood as the cornerstone of social welfare policy.[74] As he put it: \"In the colorful mass of genes that carry those characteristics we inherit from our forerunners, one may find embedded [...] even our very destinies as men.\"[7] A committed physiognomist,[75] he believed that \"only the phenotype may be influenced, to a certain extent, by our environment and our education.\"[7] In June 1929, the newspaper Adev\u0103rul published one of Rainer's critical essays on the 1923 land reform. In it, Rainer claimed that the system of land reallocation had proved ignorant of eugenic and biopolitical principles.[76] Nevertheless, as readers of his work suggests, Rainer helped preserve a balance in anthropology by also looking into environmental factors, thus questioning the ideological supremacy of scientific racism.[77]/nDuring the 1920s and early '30s, Rainer was often depressed, believing that his contribution to medical science was largely insignificant.[78] He was also upset that various of his disciples, including Daniel Danielopolu, no longer acknowledged him in their own tracts about the \"science of life\", which seemed to him a case of plagiarism.[79] He was dividing his time between Bucharest and the resort of Cheia, where he owned a small piece of property.[80]/nSubsequently, Rainer mainly focused on anthropological work and the popularization of anthropological science. Alongside sociologists such as Dimitrie Gusti, Henri H. Stahl, Sabin Manuil\u0103, Mircea Vulc\u0103nescu, and Xenia Costa-Foru, he was present on the teaching staff of Veturia Manuil\u0103's private school, where he gave lectures in anatomy to all-female classes preparing for a career in social services.[81] Between 1928 and 1932, Rainer was also involved in Gusti's rural sociology project in the Carpathians. Joining the Gusti team as an anthropometrist, he earned kudos from the scientific community of his day with Enqu\u00eates anthropologiques dans trois villages roumains des Carpathes (\"Anthropological Queries in Three Romanian Villages of the Carpathians\").[82] Published in 1937, it remains one of just four testimonials written by members of Gusti's team.[83]/nWhile on location in Nereju, Dr\u0103gu\u0219 and Fundu Moldovei, he expanded the canon of anthropometry, and began recording blood type, investigated the presence and spread of syphilis, and provided free medical consultations to the peasants.[84] Rainer and his specialist unit, including social hygienists, documented the squalid conditions of rural life. At Fundu Moldovei, where some of the villages were entirely cut off from the outside world, Rainer found that up to 50% of his samples showed contamination with syphilis, forcing him to distribute reserves of neosalvarsan.[85] Stahl, who befriended Rainer in Fundu Moldovei, recalls that the stated purpose of Rainer's visit was an attempt to bridge physiology and sociology: \"he did not yet see what that connection might be, but any research should be carried out rigorously, so that, who knows, another generation, more skilled than we are, might come along and use it.\"[86]/nRainer's anthropometric work, which used for a permanent record peasant photographs, in large part taken by Milcu,[87] remains a problematic aspect of Gustian sociology. As noted by cultural historian Z. Ornea (based on Stahl's recollections), Rainer \"carried out unperturbed his anthropometric research, although he was not an adept of racial science and had no idea of what this anthropometry and blood chemistry [...] were going to be used for. And yet, the great professor of histology would return annually to the villages that were studied by the monographic teams and to carry out this research with no purpose and no finality.\"[88] Anthropologist Vintil\u0103 Mih\u0103ilescu also notes that the combination of Gusti's sociology and Rainer's physical anthropology was a \"domestic ethnology\", \"self-referential\" and \"biased\", but nevertheless an \"important tool\" for later cultural anthropology.[89]/nRainer also made frequent trips to Western Europe and the Balkans. He was in Sweden during 1930, attending the Physiological Congress as a Physical Education Institute delegate, and paying a visit to the Racial Biology Institute.[90] In 1931 and again in 1933, he was in Greece together with sculptor Mac Constantinescu, gathering material about artistic depictions of humans in the Mycenaean period.[91] In 1935, he lectured at the Romanian Atheneum on the links between Platonism and modern science, being introduced there by zoologist Constantin Kiri\u021bescu (one of several popularization conferences Rainer held at the Atheneum, Dalles Hall, and in various provincial cities).[92] He kept his depression under control by taking trips to Turkey, and again to Greece, where he dedicated himself to the study of customs and classical art.[93] Upon his return, Rainer opened his bone collection for the public, as a permanent museum, during the Bucharest International Congress of Anthropology and Prehistorical Archeology, 1937. It comprised some 6,000 bone relics and casts.[94]/nWith his activity in academia, Rainer reacted against cronyism, taking a public stand against arbitrary appointments in teaching, and ruining his relationship with the establishment.[95] At a time when the Romanian school of anthropology was being divided between centrists and supporters of the fascist Iron Guard,[88][96] he was again confronted by the far-right. Rainer was opposed to the fascist youth, whose members instigated in favor of academic censorship in his university curriculum. At one such incident in early 1938, Rainer stood unmoved at his desk as some of his fascist students, including the son of painter Nicolae Tonitza,[50] lit firecrackers and threw eggs in his direction. However, he refused to ask for sanctions against them, and eventually received their letter of apology.[97]/nAfter 1939, although Romania was formally aligned with Nazi Germany, Rainer spoke out against Nazi racial science. In his public lectures, he dismissed the Nazi claim that cephalic indexes were good predictors of intelligence.[98] His publicized texts, deemed \"courageous\" by historian Adrian Majuru, accepted the idea of race, but denied the concept of a \"pure race\", rejected the scientific claims of Aryanism, and argued that European civilization owed its existence to Semitic peoples.[99] According to Rainer, races were rather phenotypical isolates of only one species, the homo sapiens recens, of the same genetic age; there existed no racial hierarchy.[100]/nIn 1940, at the height of World War II, Rainer helped establish an anthropological research center of which he was honorary director until his death.[101][102] That year, he and his institution were admitted into the French Prehistoric Society.[103] In 1941, following Romania's entry, alongside Germany, in the war against the Soviet Union, Rainer obtained that his team of doctors be spared conscription.[50]/nLater that year, Rainer retired from teaching, having reached the age limit. The students demanded and obtained that he be allowed to hold additional lectures in general and human biology, despite Rainer's problematic deafness.[50][104] Meanwhile, G. T. Popa, who had continued Rainer's anatomical work in Ia\u0219i between 1928 and 1942, took over his chair in Bucharest.[105] Tensions between Popa and his mentor were already showing in public,[106] with Popa fending off accusations that he had taken credit for Rainer's work on the hypophyseal portal system.[107]/nIn May 1943, Rainer was made an honorary member of the Romanian Academy.[108] He continued to publish anthropological contributions, including a 1942 description (with Ion Th. Simionescu as the co-author) of the Cioclovina Skull, the first such paleolithic discovery on Romanian soil.[109] He also contributed a chapter on \"the living substance\" to Victor V\u00e2lcovici's 1943 synthesis, Materia \u0219i via\u021ba (\"Matter and Life\").[110] He was still an outspoken adversary of the Nazi regime. Maintaining a philosophical correspondence with the medievalist Alphonse Dupront, who was stranded in occupied France, he described the Nazi age as an \"empire of suffering\", reaffirming his conviction in \"the future of mankind\".[111] He was among the signers of a letter of protest, addressed to dictator Ion Antonescu, which questioned Romania's participation in the anti-Soviet war.[112]/nDuring the same months, Rainer diagnosed himself with lung cancer, which was another probable effect of his long exposure to formaldehyde fumes.[108] He tried to hide this from his wife and his friends, claiming his problem was a mere case of paresis.[113] His house was narrowly missed by the April 1944 bombardment, and he had to move into the house of a former assistant, Ion \u021aurai. He was later moved to Hospital No. 303, where he developed metastasis in the brain.[114]/nRainer asked to be relocated to his townhouse, where he died on the morning of August 4, 1944. He had predicted the exact time of his death, and written precise instructions for his body's embalming.[115] This occurred just nineteen days before the Palace Coup that ended Romania's alliance with the Axis Powers. With the onset of Soviet occupation, Rainer's left-wing stances were highlighted in his official commemoration. Br\u0103tescu, who was also a Communist Youth militant, published such homages in the newspaper Tribuna Poporului, and spoke about Rainer at the Students' Society.[116] In the latter address, he emphasized that Rainer had been an antifascist and a reader of political works by Joseph Stalin.[117]/nRainer was generally well regarded by the communist regime, which existed in Romania until the 1989 Revolution. His texts on science and society were collected and preserved, against Rainer's final wish that they should all be burned.[66]  Some were carried in the first issues of Contemporanul review, from September 1946.[118] In 1948, the corpus was published by the academy as four volumes, together with critical essays and memoirs edited by Marta Rainer and Mihail Sevastos.[119] However, his anthropological museum, assigned to Popa and later to Milcu, was poorly staffed by the communist supervisors and faced closure. Communist supervisors such as Mihail Roller suspected that Rainer had created the anthropology research center to promote racism, but Milcu was able to convince them otherwise, and even obtained funds for an anthropological study of Romanian ethnogenesis.[120] Despite other political obstacles and the communist rejection of anthropology as an \"abstract intellectual game\", cultural anthropologist Vasile Caramelea was able to obtain approval for further research, and expanded the institute's contribution to social science.[121]/nA biography of Rainer was published by Ilie Th. Riga, in 1966, at Editura \u0218tiin\u021bific\u0103. It revealed to the public glimpses of Rainer's diaries, which had been preserved by Marta Rainer.[122] Another encomium, signed by Th. En\u0103chescu, saw print in the academic journal Studii \u0219i Cercet\u0103ri Antropologice in 1970.[123] In 1979, at Editura Eminescu, Br\u0103tescu and Mihai Neagu Basarab published Rainer's diaries and letters, which were received with great interest by the intellectual community, including Geo Bogza, Constantin Noica, and Nicolae Steinhardt,[124] but less enthusiastically by the general public. As later noted by Br\u0103tescu, regular readers found Rainer's thoughts on \"the coherence of the Cosmos\" to be \"pretentious banalities\".[125]/nRainer continued to be held in high regard after the Revolution, when light was shed on various other aspects of his work. A 2001 exhibit of his skulls collection at Galeria Catacomba made a point of reintroducing his work to the cultural circles of the day.[126] The anthropological center that Rainer helped established was renamed in his honor in 2007.[101] A street in the Cotroceni neighborhood of Bucharest is also named after him.", "72964771": "Javier de Felipe Oroquieta (born 1953, Madrid) is a research biologist specializing in the anatomical study of the human brain.[1]/nDe Felipe studied Biology, graduated in 1975 and received his Ph.D. in 1979 from the Complutense University of Madrid.

From their own work and the work of others, they came up with a model for how the levels of some proteins in a cell are controlled. In their model, the manufacture of proteins, such as the ones encoded within the lac (lactose) operon, is prevented when a repressor, encoded by a regulatory gene, binds to its operator, a specific site in the DNA sequence that is close to the genes encoding the proteins. (It is now known that a repressor bound to an operator physically blocks RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter, the site where transcription of the adjacent genes begins.)/nStudy of the control of expression of genes in the lac operon provided the first example of a system for the regulation of transcription. Monod also suggested the existence of messenger RNA molecules that link the information encoded in DNA and proteins. For these contributions he is widely regarded as one of the founders of molecular biology.[8][9]/nIn Monod's studies he discovered that the course work was decades behind the current biological science. He learned from other students a little older than himself, rather than from the faculty. \"To George Teissier he owes a preference for quantitative descriptions; Andr\u00e9 Lwoff initiated him into the potentials of microbiology; to Boris Ephrussi he owes the discovery of physiological genetics, and to Louis Rapkine the concept that only chemical and molecular descriptions could provide a complete interpretation of the function of living organisms.\"[10]/nBefore his doctoral work, Monod spent a year in the laboratory of Thomas Hunt Morgan at the California Institute of Technology working on Drosophila genetics. This was a true revelation for him and probably influenced him on developing a genetic conception of biochemistry and metabolism.[11]/nMonod's interest in the lac operon originated from his doctoral dissertation, which explored the growth of bacteria on mixtures of sugars and documented the sequential utilization of two or more sugars.[10][12][13] He coined the term diauxie to denote the frequent observations of two distinct growth phases of bacteria grown on two sugars. He theorized on the growth of bacterial cultures and promoted the chemostat theory as a powerful continuous culture system to investigate bacterial physiology.[14]/nThe experimental system ultimately used by Jacob and Monod was a common bacterium, E. coli, but the basic regulatory concept (described in the Lac operon article) that was discovered by Jacob and Monod is fundamental to cellular regulation for all organisms. The key idea is that E. coli does not bother to waste energy making such enzymes if there is no need to metabolize lactose, such as when other sugars like glucose are available. The type of regulation is called negative gene regulation, as the operon is inactivated by a protein complex that is removed in the presence of lactose (regulatory induction)./nWith Jean-Pierre Changeux and Fran\u00e7ois Jacob,[15]\nMonod proposed a theory of allosteric transitions to explain how conformational effects could allow enzyme effectors that are structurally quite different from the substrates and products to activate or inhibit the reaction: binding at an allosteric site remote from the active site could bring about a change at the active site. He made important an contribution to enzymology when he collaborated with Jeffries Wyman and Changeux to extend this concept to explain cooperative behaviour of some multi-subunit proteins.[16] This has become the most widely accepted explanation of cooperativity.[17]/nMonod was not only a biologist but also a fine musician and esteemed writer on the philosophy of science. He was a political activist and chief of staff of operations for the Forces Fran\u00e7aises de l'Interieur during World War II. In preparation for the Allied landings, he arranged parachute drops of weapons, railroad bombings, and mail interceptions./nIn 1970, Monod published Le hasard et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 \u2013 English translation Chance and Necessity (1971) \u2013, a book based on a series of lectures that he had given at Pomona College in 1969.[18] The book is a short but influential examination of the philosophical implications of modern biology, written for a general readership.[19] Monod acknowledges his connection to the French existentialists in the epigraph of the book, which quotes the final paragraphs of Camus's The Myth of Sisyphus. In summarizing recent progress in several areas of biology, including his own research, Monod highlights the ways in which information is found to take physical form and hence become capable of influencing events in the world. For example, the information allowing a protein enzyme to \"select\" only one of several similar compounds as the substrate of a chemical reaction is encoded in the precise three-dimensional shape of the enzyme; that precise shape is itself encoded by the linear sequence of amino acids constituting the protein; and that particular sequence of amino acids is encoded by the sequence of nucleotides in the gene for that enzyme./nIn the title of the book, \"necessity\" refers to the fact that the enzyme must act as it does, catalyzing a reaction with one substrate but not another, according to the constraints imposed by its structure. While the enzyme itself cannot be said in any meaningful way to have a choice about its activity, the thrust of Jacob and Monod's Nobel prize-winning research was to show how a bacterial cell can \"choose\" whether or not to carry out the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme.  As Monod explains, one way the cell can make such a choice is by either synthesizing the enzyme or not, in response to its chemical environment.  However, the synthesis/no synthesis choice is in turn governed by necessary biochemical interactions between a repressor protein, the gene for the enzyme, and the substrate of the enzyme, which interact so that the outcome (enzyme synthesis or not) differs according to the variable composition of the cell's chemical environment.  The hierarchical, modular organization of this system clearly implies that additional regulatory elements can exist that govern, are governed by, or otherwise interact with any given set of regulatory components.  Because, in general, the bacterial activity that results from these regulatory circuits is in accord with what is beneficial for the bacterial cell's survival at that time, the bacterium as a whole can be described as making rational choices, even though the bacterial components involved in deciding whether to make an enzyme (repressor, gene, and substrate) have no more choice about their activities than does the enzyme itself./nMonod shows a paradigm of how choice at one level of biological organization (metabolic activity) is generated by necessary (choiceless) interactions at another level (gene regulation); the ability to choose arises from a complex system of feedback loops that connect these interactions.  He goes on to explain how the capacity of biological systems to retain information, combined with chance variations during the replication of information (i.e. genetic mutations) that are individually rare but commonplace in aggregate, leads to the differential preservation of that information which is most successful at maintaining and replicating itself.  Monod writes that this process, acting over long periods of time, is a sufficient explanation (indeed the only plausible explanation) for the complexity and teleonomic activity of the biosphere.  Hence, the combined effects of chance and necessity, which are amenable to scientific investigation, account for our existence and the universe we inhabit, without the need to invoke mystical, supernatural, or religious explanations./nWhile acknowledging the likely evolutionary origin of a human need for explanatory myths, in the final chapter of Chance and Necessity Monod advocates an objective (hence value-free) scientific worldview as a guide to assessing truth.  He describes this as an \"ethics of knowledge\" that disrupts the older philosophical, mythological and religious ontologies, which claim to provide both ethical values and a standard for judging truth. For Monod, assessing truth separate from any value judgement is what frees human beings to act authentically, by requiring that they choose the ethical values that motivate their actions. He concludes that \"man at last knows he is alone in the unfeeling immensity of the universe, out of which he has emerged only by chance. His destiny is nowhere spelled out, nor is his duty. The kingdom above or the darkness below: it is for him to choose\".[20]  While apparently bleak, in comparison to the concepts that humanity belongs to some inevitable, universal process, or that a benevolent God created and protects us, an acceptance of the scientific assessment described in the first part of the quotation is, for Monod, the only possible basis of an authentic, ethical human life.  It is reasonable to conclude that Monod himself did not find this position bleak; the quotation he chose from Camus to introduce Chance and Necessity ends with the sentence: \"One must imagine Sisyphus happy.\"/nIn 1973, Jacques Monod was one of the signatories of the Humanist Manifesto II.[21]/nSociologist Howard L. Kaye has suggested that Monod failed in his attempt to banish \"mind and purpose from the phenomenon of life\" in the name of science.[22] It may be more accurate to suggest that Monod sought to include mind and purpose within the purview of scientific investigation, rather than attributing them to supernatural or divine causes. While Monod does not explicitly address mind or consciousness, his scientific research demonstrated that biology includes feedback loops that govern interacting systems of biochemical reactions, so that the system as a whole can be described as having a purpose and making choices. Monod's philosophical writing indicates that he recognized the implication that such systems could arise and be elaborated upon by evolution through natural selection. The importance of Monod's work as a bridge between the chance and necessity of evolution and biochemistry on the one hand, and the human realm of choice and ethics on the other, can be judged by his influence on philosophers, biologists and computer scientists such as Daniel Dennett, Douglas Hofstadter, Marvin Minsky and Richard Dawkins./nIn addition to sharing a Nobel Prize, Monod was also a recipient of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur and elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1960.[23] He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences,[24] the American Philosophical Society,[25] and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1968.[1] The Institut Jacques Monod, funded jointly by the CNRS and the University of Paris, is one of the main centers for basic research in biology in the Paris area. It is headed by Michel Werner, Research Director./nMonod was born in Paris to an American mother from Milwaukee, Charlotte (Sharlie) MacGregor Todd, and a French Huguenot father, Lucien Monod, who was a painter and inspired him artistically and intellectually.[1][10] He attended the lyc\u00e9e at Cannes until he was 18.[1] In October 1928 he started his studies in biology at the Sorbonne.[1] During World War II, Monod was active in the French Resistance, eventually becoming the chief of staff of the French Forces of the Interior.[26] He was a Chevalier in the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur (1945) and was awarded the Croix de Guerre (1945) and the American Bronze Star Medal.[27][10] Monod became a member of the French Communist Party after the end of the Second World War, but distanced himself from the party after the Lysenko Affair.[28]/nIn 1938 he married Odette Bruhl (d.1972).[29]/nJacques Monod died of leukemia in 1976 and was buried in the Cimeti\u00e8re du Grand Jas in Cannes on the French Riviera.", "67066570": "Marina Dmitrievna Zerova (Ukrainian: \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0456\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0417\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430; 29 December 1934 \u2013 9 March 2021) was a Ukrainian entomologist.

The medical treatment she received from her father (antibiotics, codeine) inspired her to pursue a career in drug development. Her family fled to West Germany before the Berlin Wall was constructed in 1961. To transport Jansen across the border, her aunt pretended that she was her child, giving her some sleeping pills so that she didn't wake up and tell the border patrol the truth.[3] Her family settled in Marl, North Rhine-Westphalia. She eventually studied biology at the University of Marburg, with the hope to work in the pharmaceutical industry.[3] Whilst she was an undergraduate, Rudolf K. Thauer arrived at the university, and established a department of microbiology.[3] Jansen completed her doctoral degree at the University of Marburg, where she studied chemical pathways in bacteria.[5][6][7] After earning her degree, Jansen moved to Cornell University as an Alexander von Humboldt Foundation postdoctoral fellow investigating the function of the acetylcholine receptor with George Paul Hess.[8][9] In particular, Jansen focussed on the yeast expression of multi-subunit neuronal receptors.[3]/nJansen was fascinated by the development of novel pharmaceuticals, and wanted to return to Europe, so moved to Geneva to join the Glaxo Institute for Molecular Biology. At the Glaxo Institute for Molecular Biology Jansen encouraged the immunologists to create a novel receptor for immunoglobulin E.[3] She completed an internship in the laboratory of David Bishop at the University of Oxford, where she studied the expression of insect cells using baculoviridae.[3]/nIn 1992 Jansen moved back to the United States, where she joined the vaccine division at Merck & Co. She became interested in making vaccines, and started work on the human papillomavirus infection.[10] Soon after Jian Zhou and Ian Frazer started work on the HPV vaccine, proposing that the proteins of the human papillomavirus infection virus-like particles could be self assembled into something that could be used as a vaccine. Jansen proposed the vaccine should be made in yeast, a substrate which Merck & Co. had previously used for the Hepatitis B vaccine.[10][11] Various innovations were required to ensure that the yeast did not degrade the virus like particles, and prevent their aggregation.[3] Jansen managed to convince Edward Scolnick that the experimental vaccine was worth pursuing, and started to make the assays. Jansen worked with Laura Koutsky at the University of Washington to conduct natural history studies that informed the phase 2 clinical trials.[3] In 2002 the vaccination was proven 100% effective,[12][13] and Jansen left the Merck & Co. knowing that the vaccination would be a success.[10][14][15]/nShe joined VaxGen in 2004, where she was appointed chief scientific officer.[16] In 2006 Jansen left VaxGen to join Wyeth Pharmaceuticals in 2006, where she was responsible for vaccine discovery.[8] Here she developed the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar-13).[17] In 2010 Jansen was appointed adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania.[8]/nJansen is concerned about the rise of vaccine hesitancy. During a conference at Pfizer in 2019, she said \u201cI don't know what motivates an individual to ignore scientific facts.

Before this people in North America and Europe had wondered where the small glass eels, or elvers, came from.[1]/nSchmidt was born at J\u00e6gerspris, Denmark, son of Ernst Schmidt and Camilla Ellen Sophie Schmidt (born Kjeldall and sister to the chemist Johan Kjeldahl).[2]\nSchmidt began his studies of natural history at the University of Copenhagen under professor of botany Eugen Warming (1841\u20131924), and obtained an MS degree in biology in 1898. He obtained a grant from the Carlsberg Foundation to study the flora of the coastal areas of Ko Chang in then Siam, including both mangrove trees and microalgae. He made his doctoral thesis in biology and botany, on shoot architecture of mangrove trees and Eugen Warming served as faculty opponent in October 1903.[3]/nSchmidt then more or less switched to marine zoology, working 1902\u20131909 part-time for the Botanical Institute of the University of Copenhagen, part-time for the Danish Commission for Investigation of the Sea. In 1909, he was made head of the department of physiology at the Carlsberg Laboratory, a post he held until his early death./nSchmidt worked in parallel on phycology, where he described the genus Richelia (filamentous heterocyst-forming Cyanobacteria dwelling inside diatoms), on plant physiology and genetics, especially of hops, and on large-scale oceanography and ichthyology./nBeginning in 1904, Johannes Schmidt led a series of expeditions into the Mediterranean Sea and the North Atlantic to investigate eels. At the time it was believed that the European eel spawned in the Mediterranean Sea, as this was the only place where eel larvae had been observed. However, the first Thor expedition to the North Atlantic, led by Schmidt, caught the first eel larvae ever observed in the Atlantic Ocean, on a position west of the Faroe Islands.[2] This discovery was defining for Schmidt's career and he conducted a series of expeditions in the following years to search for the elusive spawning grounds of the eel. He did this by systematically trawling the deep sea of the Atlantic, always moving in the direction where he found the smallest larvae. In 1921, on the second Dana expedition, he finally located the spawning grounds to the Sargasso Sea.[2] In 1928\u20131930, he led the third Dana Expedition, funded by the Carlsberg Foundation, being a two-year voyage around the world's oceans./nA peculiar incident is worthy of notice: a paper on the life-history of the eel, published 1912 in Germany,[4] had first been sent to London to be published by the Royal Society, but was refused with a note that Grassi's work on the subject sufficed. This constitutes a clear example of peer review failure.[5] Ten years later, Schmidt's work on the spawning place of the eel was published by the Royal Society[6] and even later he was awarded the Darwin Medal.[7]/nIn 1903 he married Ingeborg K\u00fchle (1880-1958), daughter of  S\u00f8ren Anton van der Aa K\u00fchle (1849-1906),  chief director of the Old Carlsberg Brewery.

She is currently a faculty member at UC San Diego./nGolden was born in Pine Bluff, Arkansas in 1957.[1] She attended the local public high school, where she was involved with the marching band and school newspaper. She was accepted to the Mississippi University for Women in 1976 as a journalism major, but soon switched her studies to major in biology and minor in chemistry./nGolden graduated from MUW in two years, after which she was offered a position in the first cohort of trainees in a NIH-financed doctoral program in genetics at the University of Missouri. During her graduate program, Golden met James Golden, a fellow doctoral student.[2] They later married in 1979. At the University of Missouri, Golden researched the protein makeup of the photosynthetic center in cyanobacteria, work she continued when she moved to the University of Chicago in 1983 as a postdoctoral research fellow.[1]/nIn 1986 Golden accepted a faculty position at Texas A&M to further her investigation into light-dependent gene regulation in bacteria. While at Texas A&M, Golden became interested in studying circadian rhythms after her first encounter with Carl H. Johnson and Takao Kondo, with whom she would go on to discover the Kai complex.[2] Golden was promoted to Distinguished Professor at Texas A&M in 2003, and then moved to UC San Diego in 2008 where she is currently a Distinguished Professor and the Director of the Center for Circadian Biology.[3]/nGolden began her graduate career with Louis A. Sherman, where she used genetics to research the proteins in photosynthetic complexes of the cyanobacteria Synechoccus elongatus. Golden was the first to demonstrate that a mutant allele of the psbA gene is sufficient to confer herbicide resistance in cyanobacteria.[2] Other research later confirmed that this gene coded for a protein integral to the Photosystem II complex involved in photosynthesis.[4] These findings also demonstrated that genetic manipulation of cyanobacteria was relatively simple, opening up S. elongatus as a model organism for future genetic experiments.[2] During her postdoctoral research at the University of Chicago, in the lab of Robert Haselkorn, Golden continued to work on developing genetic manipulation techniques for Synechoccus elongatus in order to elucidate mechanisms of gene regulation in photosynthesis genes. In 1989, Golden's team discovered that the specific psbA allele expressed by cyanobacteria depended on the lighting conditions in which the colony was grown.[5] This finding led her to investigate more generally how light influences expression of photosynthetic genes in the organism[6] and contributes to the overall understanding of bacterial responses to environmental input.[7] This line of inquiry necessitated the development of a technique for visualizing changes in gene expression in living organisms. During her time as a professor at the Texas A&M, Golden attempted to solve this problem by attaching a luciferase gene to the promoters of the cyanobacterial genes of interest and viewing the colonies with a night vision scope.[2] The approach was a success, allowing for quantification of cyanobacterial gene expression in vivo over an extended time period. This technique drew the interest of chronobiologist Carl H. Johnson, with whom Golden would go on to collaborate and eventually discover the KaiABC complex .[2]/nGolden studies the endogenous rhythms of cyanobacteria, a group of photosynthetic bacteria known to have circadian clocks. She transformed Synechococcus elongatus, one of the better studied cyanobacteria species, with a luciferase reporter gene and showed circadian rhythm in bioluminescence. This reporter system was used to discover three key proteins related to the cyanobacterial clock: KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. In collaboration with Carl H. Johnson and Takao Kondo, she demonstrated and described the molecular mechanism regulating circadian rhythms in S. elongatus PCC 7942,[8] the only model organism for a prokaryotic circadian clock.[3] Susan Golden identified genes in the S. elongatus genome that contribute to circadian rhythm through mutational screens using transposons to disrupt genes and their function. In one mutation screen study, nineteen mutations were identified and mapped to the three kai genes; Inactivation of any single kai gene reduced kaiBC-promoter activity and abolished the circadian rhythm of expression of KaiA and KaiB.[9]/nS. elongatus has a circadian clock with an oscillator based only on three proteins: KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. Circadium rhythm is generated based on KaiC phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Light transmits energy and information to the cyanobacteria, affecting transcriptional regulation of the circadium clock. This 24-hour rhythm can be recreated in vitro with the addition of ATP.[10] The ratio of ATP/ADP fluctuates during the course of the day, and is sensed by KaiC, which phosphorylates or de-phosphorylates based on this signal. This Kai protein system is the simplest post-translational oscillator known so far./nIn photosynthesizing cyanobacteria, the circadian clock is driven by light and reset by darkness. When Golden mutated the gene cikA, the clock was functional but could not be reset, resulting in the bacterial equivalent of permanent jet lag. CikA protein contains a domain that is structurally similar to KaiA, which was also found to be important in resetting the clock. CikA and KaiA bind to quinones, which carry electrons in the electron transport chain of photosynthesis. Quinones are oxidized in the dark and reduced in the light, and the redox state affects KaiA activity. When quinones are oxidized, KaiA separates from KaiC and binds to them, resetting the clock. Therefore, quinones are essential in transmitting light information to KaiC.[2]/nAfter moving to UC San Diego in 2008, Susan Golden's research converged with that of her husband, James Golden, to investigate biofuels.[2] She currently researches the potential of utilizing cyanobacteria for industrial production of biofuels. Cyanobacteria are attractive due to simplistic genomes and ability to be genetically modified for industrial efficiency. Their photosynthetic nature may ideally be used to produce sustainably produce biofuels, potentially replacing the need for petroleum and other fossil fuels.[3] They have simple requirements for growth, only requiring sunlight, water, and inorganic trace elements for fast growth. Cyanobacteria are capable of fixing atmospheric carbon (carbon dioxide) into bio-oils and biofuels.[11]/nIn 2016, Golden and colleagues manually curated a model of metabolism in S. elongatus, indicating the importance of a linear tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) metabolic pathway and potential modifications for bio-industrial application.[12]", "69851894": "Dirk Frans Elisabeth Thys van den Audenaerde (born 14 March 1934 in Mechelen) is a Belgian ichthyologist.

This she worked out so successfully that Tatum made her his TA.[2]  She later traveled west to California, and after a summer studying at Stanford University's Hopkins Marine Station under Cornelius Van Niel, she entered a master's program in genetics.

These contributions laid the foundation for much of the genetics work done in the latter half of the twentieth century.

She first reported the discovery in 1951 while she was a PhD student and later provided a detailed description in a 1953 paper in the journal Genetics.[13][8]  She was working with an E. coli K12 strain that had been mutagenized with ultraviolet light.  When she incubated a mixture of the mutant strain with its parent E. coli K12 strain on an agar plate, she saw plaques, which were known to be caused by bacteriophages.  The source of the bacteriophage was the parental K12 strain.[8]  The UV treatment had \"cured\" the bacteriophage from the mutant, making it sensitive to infection by the same bacteriophage that the parent produced.  The bacteriophage was named \u03bb.[14] Her studies showed that \u03bb had both a typical lifestyle in which the phage rapidly made many copies of itself before bursting out of the E. coli host and an alternative lifestyle in which the phage existed quietly within E. coli as just another genetic marker.[13][15]/nEsther and Joshua Lederberg demonstrated that \u03bb, in its quiescent form, genetically mapped near the E. coli genes required for metabolism of the sugar galactose (gal). The Lederbergs proposed that the genetic material of \u03bb physically integrated into the chromosome next to the gal genes and subsequently replicated as a prophage along with the DNA of the host bacterium.[16][2] When the prophage is later prompted to leave the host, it must excise itself from the host DNA. Occasionally, the phage DNA that is excised is accompanied by adjacent host DNA, which can be introduced into a new host by the phage. This process is called specialized transduction.[17]/nFollowing publication of her studies on \u03bb over several years, Lederberg presented her findings at international conferences. In 1957, Lederberg gave a talk on \u03bb lysogeny and specialized transduction at the Symposium of Bacterial and Viral Genetics in Canberra, Australia.[18][2] In 1958, she presented her findings on the fine-structure mapping of the gal locus at the 10th International Congress of Genetics in Montreal, Canada.[2]/nLederberg's discovery of the fertility factor (F factor) stemmed directly from her experiments to map the location of lambda prophage on the E. coli chromosome by crosses with other E. coli strains with known genetic markers.  When some of the crosses failed to give rise to recombinants, she suspected that some of her E. coli strains had lost a \"fertility factor.\"[19]  In her own words:/nIn terms of testing available markers ... the data showed that there was a specific locus for lysogenicity. ... In the course of such linkage [genetic mapping] studies,...one day, ZERO recombinants were recovered....I explored the notion that there was some sort of 'fertility factor' which if absent, resulted in no recombinants. For short, I named this F.[19]/nLater work by others showed that the F factor is a bacterial DNA sequence harboring genes that allow a bacterium to donate DNA to a recipient bacterium by direct contact in a process called conjugation. The DNA sequence encoding the F factor can exist either as an independent plasmid or integrate into the bacterial cell's chromosome.[19]/nThe problem of reproducing bacterial colonies en masse in the same geometric configuration as on original agar plate was first successfully solved by replica plating, as implemented by Esther and Joshua Lederberg.[20]  Scientists had been struggling for a reliable solution for at least a decade before the Lederbergs implemented it successfully.  Less efficient forerunners to the methodology were toothpicks, paper, wire brushes, and multipronged inoculators.[21] Biographer Rebecca Ferrell believes that the method Lederberg invented was likely inspired by using her father's press at his work, pressing a plate of bacterial colonies onto sterile velvet, after which they were stamped onto plates of media with different ingredients, depending on the desired traits the researcher wished to observed.[2]/nThe Lederbergs used the replica-plating method to demonstrate that bacteriophage- and antibiotic-resistance mutants arose in the absence of phages or antibiotics.[22]  The spontaneous nature of mutations was previously demonstrated by Luria and Delbr\u00fcck.  However, many scientists failed to grasp the mathematical arguments of Luria and Delbr\u00fcck's findings, and their paper was either ignored or rejected by other scientists. The controversy was settled by the Lederbergs' simple replica-plating experiment.[23][21]/nEsther Lederberg returned to Stanford in 1959 with Joshua Lederberg. She remained at Stanford for the balance of her research career, directing the Plasmid Reference Center (PRC) at the Stanford School of Medicine from 1976 to 1986.[24]  As director of the PRC, she organized and maintained a registry of the world's plasmids, transposons, and insertion sequences.[2] She initiated the system of naming insertion sequences and transposons sequentially beginning with IS1 and Tn1.[25][26] The sequential numbering continued until her retirement.[25]/nShe retired from her position in the Stanford Department of Microbiology and Immunology in 1985, but continued her work at the PRC as a volunteer.[27]/nMicrobiologist Stanley Falkow said of Esther Lederberg that \"[e]xperimentally and methodologically she was a genius in the lab.\"[28] However, although Esther Lederberg was a pioneer research scientist, she faced significant challenges as a woman scientist in the 1950s and 1960s./nAfter her foundational discoveries of the F factor and \u03bb in graduate school, Joshua Lederberg stopped her from conducting additional experiments to follow up on her discoveries. According to Esther, Joshua, as her thesis advisor, wanted her to finish her PhD dissertation. Her graduate school advisor, R.A. Brink, may not have recognized the significance of her discoveries. She may have been fully recognized for her discoveries if she were allowed to pursue them immediately. Instead, the delay hurt her legacy as an independent research scientist, and her findings on bacterial sex are now credited primarily to her husband.[29] In fact, most textbooks highlight Joshua Lederberg's role in the discoveries made jointly with Esther.[12] The lack of credit Esther Lederberg is given for development of the replica plating technique has been cited as an example of the Matilda effect, in which discoveries made by women scientists are unfairly attributed to their male colleagues.[30] By the time Joshua won the Nobel Prize in 1958, the research centers that were recruiting him saw Esther as his wife and research assistant rather than an independent scientist.[31]/nLederberg was excluded from writing a chapter in the 1966 book Phage and the Origins of Molecular Biology, a commemoration of molecular biology.  According to the science historian Prina Abir-Am, her exclusion was \"incomprehensible\" because of her important discoveries in bacteriophage genetics.  Abir-Am attributed her exclusion in part to the sexism that prevailed during the 1960s.[32]/nAs Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza later wrote, \"Dr. Esther Lederberg has enjoyed the privilege of working with a very famous husband. This has been at times also a setback, because inevitably she has not been credited with as much of the credit as she really deserved. I know that very few people, if any, have had the benefit of as valuable a co-worker as Joshua has had.\"[33][2] Her husband Joshua did acknowledge her work and contributions. When the couple attended the 1951 Cold Spring Harbor Symposium, he discussed Esther's doctoral work on E. coli and acknowledged her as second author.[2] Ferrell notes, however, that he did not later acknowledge her work when he wrote an autobiographical account of their discovery of genetic recombination in bacteria.[2]/nLederberg was an advocate for herself and other women during the early years of feminism's second wave.[34] Like many other women scientists at Stanford University, Lederberg struggled for professional recognition. As her husband began his tenure as the head of the genetics department at Stanford in 1959, she and two other women petitioned the dean of the medical school over the lack of women faculty.  She was eventually appointed a faculty position as research associate professor in the department of microbiology and immunology, but the position was untenured.[1]  According to Abir-Am, Esther had to fight to stay employed at Stanford after divorcing Joshua.[35] Later in 1974 as a senior scientist, she was forced to transition to a position as adjunct professor of medical microbiology, which was effectively a demotion.  Her short-term appointment was to be renewed on a rolling basis and was dependent on her securing grant funding.[1]/nA lifelong musician, Lederberg was a devotee of early music and enjoyed playing medieval, Renaissance, and baroque music on original instruments.[2][36] She played the recorder and in 1962 founded the Mid-Peninsula Recorder Orchestra, which plays compositions from the 13th century to the present.[37]/nLederberg also loved the works of Charles Dickens and Jane Austen. She belonged to societies devoted to studying and celebrating these two authors, the Dickens Society of Palo Alto and the Jane Austen Society.[38]/nShe married Joshua Lederberg in 1946; they divorced in 1968.[4] In 1989, she met Matthew Simon, an engineer who shared her interest in early music.[22] They married in 1993 and remained married for the rest of her life.[2]/nShe died in Stanford, California, on November 11, 2006, from pneumonia and congestive heart failure at the age of 83.[27]", "41114380": "Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Ren\u00e9 Koehler (7 March 1860, Saint-Di\u00e9 \u2013 19 April 1931, Lyon) was a French zoologist best known for his research of echinoderms./nHe studied medicine and zoology in Nancy.

Buck was born in Seattle, Washington on January 29, 1947. Her father was an electrical engineer who spent his time inventing and building different items in his spare time, while her mother was a homemaker who spent a majority of her free time solving word puzzles.[10] Buck was the second of three children, all of them girls.[11] Her father has Irish ancestry as well as ancestors dating back to the American revolution. Her mother is of Swedish ancestry.[12] In 1994 Buck met Roger Brent, also a biologist. The two married in 2006.[13]/nBuck received her B.S. in psychology and microbiology in 1975 from the University of Washington, Seattle.  She is the first female University of Washington alumnus to win the Nobel Prize.[14] She was awarded her Ph.D. in immunology in 1980 under the direction of Professor Ellen Vitetta at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.[15]/nIn 1980, Buck began postdoctoral research at Columbia University under Benvenuto Pernis (1980\u20131982).  In 1982, she joined the laboratory of Richard Axel, also at Columbia in the Institute of Cancer Research. After reading Sol Snyder's group research paper at Johns Hopkins University, Buck set out to map the olfactory process at the molecular level, tracing the travel of odors through the cells of the nose to the brain. Buck and Axel worked with rat genes in their research and identified a family of genes that code for more than 1000 odor receptors and published these findings in 1991.[6][16] Later that year, Buck became an assistant professor in the Neurobiology Department at Harvard Medical School where she established her own lab.[17] After finding how odors are detected by the nose, Buck published her findings in 1993 on how the inputs from different odor receptors are organized in the nose.[16] Essentially, her primary research interest is on how pheromones and odors are detected in the nose and interpreted in the brain. She is a Full Member of the Basic Sciences Division at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and an Affiliate Professor of Physiology and Biophysics at the University of Washington, Seattle./nIn her landmark paper published in 1991 with Richard Axel, Linda Buck discovered hundreds of genes code for the odorant sensors located in the olfactory neurons of our noses.[15] Each receptor is a protein that changes when an odor attaches to the receptor, causing an electrical signal to be sent to the brain.[11] Differences between odorant sensors mean that certain odors cause a signal to be released from a certain receptor.[11] We are then able to interpret varying signals from our receptors as specific scents.[11] To do this, Buck and Axel cloned olfactory receptors, showing that they belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors.  By analyzing rat DNA, they estimated that there were approximately 1,000 different genes for olfactory receptors in the mammalian genome.[18][19] This research opened the door to the genetic and molecular analysis of the mechanisms of olfaction. In their later work, Buck and Axel have shown that each olfactory receptor neuron remarkably only expresses one kind of olfactory receptor protein and that the input from all neurons expressing the same receptor is collected by a single dedicated glomerulus of the olfactory bulb./nBuck was awarded the Takasago Award for Research in Olfaction (1992), Unilever Science Award (1996), R.H.

He studied speciation in the blackberry (Rubus sp.). In 1892 he spent some time at the University of T\u00fcbingen under Albrecht Zimmermann. For his Ph.D. from Lund University he studied elaiospheres in the mesophyll. He noted that the plants that remain green in winter in southern Sweden had little starch in the leaves during winter. They instead had oil or sugars which prevented injury to the cells from freezing.[1] With a Battram travel scholarship he went to Germany and spent some time in Berlin. Here he joined the Scandinavian circle around August Strindberg. He then went to Leipzig, working with Wilhelm Pfeffer. After working as an assistant of Ernst Stahl at the University of Jena, he became a professor of botany at Uppsala University in 1909 and at Lund University in 1910.[2] He was among the first Swedish scientists to write popular science.

She is later revived after Will captures the escaping parasite.[13] In the two-part season finale \"Revelations\", the Cabal launch a bioweapon called \"Lazarus\", which causes any exposed abnormal to attack humans. To combat this, Magnus regroups the Five to Bhalasaam, a lost city, to recover the source blood (vampire blood). However, by the end Magnus is distressed to learn that the Cabal have turned Ashley against her and the team and steals the blood sample.[11][12]/nThe second season begins six weeks after the end of the first, where Magnus works hard to defeat the Cabal and save Ashley, whom the Cabal transformed to a vampire-hybrid superabnormal, one of six tasked to destroy the Sanctuary Network.[14] When the superabnormals arrive at the Old City Sanctuary, Magnus is able to get through to Ashley, who recognises her in time to save her from another superabnormal, and then teleports. Because an electromagnetic field is active, it would mean whoever teleports inside would be vaporized.[15] Despite this, Magnus believes Ashley's life energy may be in the electromagnetic field's buffer. When it does not, she is forced to accept that Ashley has died.[16] Because of her death, and other loved ones because of her longevity, she tried to find a way to age at a normal rate again. She finds an elixir used by the Mayans in Honduras, but it has the side effect of turning humans into zombie-like creatures. After being shown the potential consequences of the elixir's release by an incorporeal guardian, she decides to leave it behind.[17]/nLater on in the season, her leadership of the Sanctuary Network would be called into question by the other heads of house. In \"Veritas\", she sets up an elaborate scheme to apprehend a telepath named Emma (Erica Cerra), whom she suspects of working against the Network. In the scheme, Magnus forges a mental illness and fakes the murder of her butler, Bigfoot (Heyerdahl), and makes Emma believe she kept alive Big Bertha, the most dangerous abnormal on Earth, which Magnus was thought to have killed.[18] However, it is revealed in the season finale \"Kali\", Magnus did indeed keep her alive in secrecy, but sedated, as she believes that killing Bertha would jeopardize the planet.[19] When Big Bertha is being controlled by Edward Forsythe, Magnus attempts to sedate Big Bertha again, but by then, Terrence Wexford (Paul McGillion) overrides her authority and assumes control of the network. His attempt to kill Bertha only succeeds in angering her, and she launches a tsunami.[20]/nThe third season begins with Magnus forcing Wexford to step down as head of the Sanctuary Network, thereby putting herself back in command, while the rest of the team deal with the tsunami.[21] Though they are not happy that Big Bertha is still alive, the other Sanctuary house heads decide to keep Magnus in charge, while also firing Wexford for breaking several protocols. She learns from Will that when he talked to Kali, the avatar manifestation of Big Bertha, into stopping the tsunami, he saw her father,[22] who left her clues leading to a map leading to Hollow Earth, thought to be the home of every abnormal species on the planet.[23] In \"Breach\" Magnus learns Adam Worth is still alive, and he also intends to find Hollow Earth,[24] having been there before and resurrected.[6] After finding an entrance to Hollow Earth in Tibet, she and the team venture to the underground city of Praxis, where leader Ranna (Polly Walker) executes her and her team for trespassing.[25] However, they are later resurrected as she wants their help in saving the city, which is facing destruction because a hyperspecies abnormal is not controlling the city's geothermal energy. After saving it, Magnus and her team and Ranna part in good terms. It is also revealed Worth also came to the city to steal a power source with unlimited capabilities. Though it was assumed Druitt killed him before he could leave with it,[26] it is later revealed in the season finale that Druitt kept him alive and that he is using the power source to create a time machine and cure his daughter's leukemia, which could cause untold consequences on the planet.  His first failed attempt causes the destruction of Praxis,[27] and a time dilation bubble in Carentan, France.[28] Magnus fails to stop him from succeeding, but does follow him through a time portal to London in 1898.[27]/nMagnus pursues Worth throughout London to stop him from curing his daughter Imogene, who is meant to die in the timeline. During the pursuit she tries to avoid her past self, but fails to stop encountering Watson, who quickly discovers she is from his future, but he promises to keep quiet for the sake of preserving the timeline. When Worth chases Magnus later he accidentally kills Imogene, restoring the timeline. After killing Worth, Magnus ends up in hiding for the next 113 years before she can resurface to help Will dealing with a mass of Abnormals invading the surface.[29] In the season finale, it is revealed that Helen had been secretly working with several important figures of the 20th Century, including Albert Einstein and Buckminster Fuller amongst others, and had built a new underground Sanctuary./nThe Syfy website describes Magnus as a \"beautiful and enigmatic\" character who has \"devoted her life to the practical research of cutting edge medicine and science\".[3] Her work is to explore the world of abnormals. While the rest of the world dismissed them as monstrous figments of their imaginations and elements of childhood nightmares, Magnus realizes that they are the world's triumphs and mistakes. Magnus hence becomes their protector, but in some cases, their captor. She is also described as \"bold and straightforward, brave and no-nonsense, yet she remains proudly true to her formal Victorian English sensibilities\".[3] Portraying actress Amanda Tapping described Magnus as a \"crazy character\" who is \"very eccentric and very sexy and very unapologetic\".[30]/nMagnus \"adores her daughter Ashley, respecting her independence and self-reliance \u2013 but that doesn't preclude some occasional mother-daughter friction\".[3] Tapping has said that there is a \"huge amount of respect\" between the two characters, adding \"Ashley knows that when her mother says she needs to do something then she says it for a reason. And Magnus has a huge amount of respect for Ashley because Ashley can do things that she can't.\"[31] Magnus made a hard choice of having Ashley even though she does not have her mother's longevity, and Magnus would outlive her daughter. In the first season, Magnus recruits Will as her prot\u00e9g\u00e9. When asked what Magnus thinks of Will, Tapping stated \"I think Helen finds him fascinating. He's so idealistic, she sees in him all the qualities that she admires, but all the qualities that she knows will probably get beaten out of him over the course of time. His idealism and purity of thought and the way he analyses things\u00a0... she absolutely respects that, but I think she also realises that there's going to come a time when he's going to become a bit jaded\u00a0... There are a couple of episodes where there's been this bizarre sexual tension between the two of them\u00a0... but generally there's just a huge healthy respect.\"[31] During a Blastr interview in 2011, Tapping further explains Magnus' relationship with Will; \"I love how this relationship has developed. [...] \"It's been a really organic transformation of Will's character and Magnus. To actually bring somebody on board who, initially, it's all about teaching him the ropes. And then as the seasons have gone on he's come into his own. He's come into his own as a scientist. He's come into his own in terms of his relationship with the people in the Sanctuary.\"[32] Dunne meanwhile stated \"there's a nice synchronicity that has formed between the two characters. And really, they're two people that depend on each other for survival. And therefore, that's where the respect comes out of.\"[32]/nSeries creator Damian Kindler conceived the idea of Sanctuary in 2001. Many of his ideas were included in the final product, one of them being the English scientist Helen Magnus. A few years later, Kindler asked Martin Wood if there was a potential for a series. When Wood believed it would be, they both decided to approach Amanda Tapping to participate in the project, and she accepted. Kindler believed that casting Tapping was a \"nice fit\" to the character because the actress was born in England.[33] Tapping, who played the regular character Samantha Carter in Stargate SG-1 and sister show Stargate Atlantis, did not know the future of her role in the show when she was approached to appear on Sanctuary in 2006. When the webseries started shooting in January 2007, it did not conflict with her commitments on Stargate. After the fourth season of Atlantis, Tapping was offered the chance to return to the fifth season and she accepted. When Sanctuary was picked up to a television series, Tapping decided to turn down the Atlantis contract, having been encouraged by her husband to move on after playing Carter for eleven years. She went through a \"weird disconnect\" playing Magnus since \"Sam Carter was so much a part of me\".[34] However, she was able to embrace playing a new character \"pretty quickly\".[34]/nNevertheless, Tapping found it a challenge to play a different character, as Carter and Magnus have different personalities and points of view; \"after playing a character like Sam Carter for so long where her physicality is so comfortable \u2013 Sam is so comfortable in her own skin and Helen is this very sexual, more mysterious being. She has a much darker edge to her and it was sort of finding that because Carter always looks on the bright side and Helen has been around so long, and has seen so much of the evil in human society if you will.\"[35] Whilst filming the webisodes, Tapping wore a dark-haired wig,[36] but when the television series was being shot, she dyed her hair to match the hair colour of the wig.[37] Tapping spoke with an English accent throughout the run of the series. Although many of her relatives are from the United Kingdom and speak with British accents Tapping found the accent a challenge, as her character came from the Victorian era, which is a \"very specific way of speaking. She clings to that eccentricity a bit, to that Britishness.\"[31] The actress listened to several different voices, as she had to factor in the fact that Magnus lived all around the world.[31]/nSanctuary was mostly filmed on virtual green screen sets. Initially Tapping went through what she called \"chroma key green headaches\" because she had to stare at nothing but bright green walls for the first few days. When she got used to it, she likened filming on green screen to working in theatre.[38] In the second season her daughter, Ashley was killed off. The producers, as well as the American and Canadian networks to give the character, including Magnus, a deep and most dramatic impact.[39] They also wanted Magnus to feel more angry and vulnerable throughout the season, especially in the first three episodes.[40] After playing Magnus in the series' third season, Tapping admitted that she still does not get Magnus because \"there's so many things about the decisions that she makes that I still can't wrap my head around, and to me that's fascinating as an actor, to try to get inside somebody so complex and so kind of confusing.\"[32] In the episode \"Normandy\", Tapping wore a red-haired wig for Magnus during her time in the Second World War, as an homage to her late grandmother. For the fourth season, Tapping requested that Magnus would be given a new love interest.[32] The request was granted in the form of a female virologist appearing early in the season (thus establishing Magnus's bisexuality)./nIn addition to being an actor, Tapping was also an executive producer on the series. However, she did not get paid extra as that salary would go towards financing the show, which was not backed up by a studio.[41] She also served as a director on certain days if other directors were unavailable, or called in sick.[38] In the second season, she was allowed to direct \"Veritas\", the seventh episode.[42]/nAccording to Mark Wilson of About.com, Amanda Tapping was enthusiastic about creating a radically different character after eleven years playing Samantha Carter in Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis, and expended tremendous effort to separate Helen from Carter as successfully as possible. Tapping was able to successfully portray a woman who's experienced a century and a half of isolation, strangeness, and relentless compassion.[43] Rick Bentley from McClatchy Newspapers commented Tapping's role as Dr. Magnus was a way for the actor to make a name of herself outside the Stargate universe as Carter.[44] Magnus is also described as a \"non-glib, female Jack Harkness;\" Jack Harkness being the main character from the British science fiction show Torchwood.[45] Hilary Rothing of UGO said that \"Dr. Helen Magnus is intelligent, alluring and has one of those tasty British accents \u2013 Victorian era to be exact. That's because she's a 157 years old. But seriously, she doesn't look a day over 35.\"[46] She also added that Tapping is \"right at home\" taking the lead for the show.[46] Alex Walker of Den of Geek believed Magnus was \"typical for an English character in an American TV show, with a liking for tea and a cut-glass elocution betraying no hint of a regional accent\".[47] Helen Magnus has been listed number ten in TV Squad's \"Ten Most mysterious characters on television\".[48]/nMagnus's English accent was not well received by some critics. She was listed ninth in io9's \"Worst Fake Accents From The Yanks (And Canucks) Of Science Fiction\", with Meredith Woerner stating \"I really want to like this new Sci Fi Channel show, especially since the monsters look amazing \u2013 but I'm worried Tapping's dreadful accent will get in the way. It sounds completely forced in all the clips I've seen so far, but I'll guess I'll have to wait until October 3 to make my full assessment.\"[49] Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune wondered why Tapping decided to speak with an \"iffy accent,\" but added she would be of interest by fans of Tapping's previous works, notably Stargate.[50] Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called Tapping's English accent \"unremarkable\", whilst calling the show an \"unremarkable series.\"[51]/nOver the course of the series, Tapping's portrayal of Magnus resulted in several award nominations. Tapping was nominated for a 2009 Gemini Award for \"Best Performance by an Actress in a Continuing Leading Dramatic Role,\" for her role in \"Requiem\", but lost out to Being Erica's Erin Karpluk[52] In the same year, Tapping won the similar \"Best Lead Performance by a Female in a Dramatic Series\" Leo Award for the same episode.[53] She was nominated for the same category again in 2010 for \"Pavor Nocturnus\",[54] and in 2011 for \"Breach\",[55] but lost out to Erin Karpluk[56] and Blackstone's Carmen Moore, respectively.[57]", "48913301": "Danielle \"Hopi\" Elizabeth Hoekstra (born 1972) is an evolutionary biologist working at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts and serving as the Dean of its Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

Hoekstra's first name \"Hopi\" is derived from a Dutch term of endearment.[2][9] Hoekstra attended a high school near Palo Alto, California.[2] She chose to attend college at the University of California, Berkeley, where she initially intended to study political science. She chose the university because she wanted to play volleyball, which she did for two years.[2] She has stated that at one point she wanted to become the U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands, but she was drawn into biology by a class on biomechanics taught by Robert J. Full. She went on to work in Full's lab, studying cockroach locomotion.[2][9]/nHoekstra received her B.A. in Integrative Biology from the University of California, Berkeley. Before her graduate studies, she researched grizzly bears for a year in Yellowstone National Park. She obtained her Ph.D. in Zoology as a Howard Hughes Predoctoral Fellow at the University of Washington.[1]  For her postdoctoral work, she studied the genetic basis of adaptive melanism in pocket mice at the University of Arizona. In 2003, she became an assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego. In 2007, she moved to Harvard University, where she received tenure in 2010.[1][2]\nShe is a member of the advisory board for Current Biology.[10]  In June 2023, she was named as the Dean of Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences, succeeding Claudine Gay, who had assumed the University's presidency a month prior.[11] Hoekstra assumed office on August 1, 2023./nHoekstra is best known for studying the genetic mechanisms that influence the evolution of highly complex natural behaviors.[12] In 2013, Hoekstra published an article in the journal Nature on the genetics of burrowing behavior in two sister species of Peromyscus mice; the oldfield mouse (P. polionotus), which builds elaborate burrows complete with an escape tunnel, and the deer mouse (P. maniculatis), which builds a simple and shallow nest.[12][2] Using a combination of behavioral assays and classical genetic strategies, Hoekstra and her students identified four regions of DNA which control the length of the tunnels dug by the mice.[12] Students in her lab have also studied the connections between digging behavior and the neurobiology of reward.[12]/nShe has also studied the evolution of the color of mice coats and its significance for adaptation.[2] In 2013, her team published an article in the journal Science, describing how coat color in mice was controlled by nine separate mutations within a single gene, named \"agouti.\"[3] Speaking about this discovery, Hoekstra said, \"The question has always been whether evolution is dominated by these big leaps or smaller steps. When we first implicated the agouti gene, we could have stopped there and concluded that evolution takes these big steps as only one major gene was involved, but that would have been wrong. When we looked more closely, within this gene, we found that even within this single locus, there are, in fact, many small steps.\"[3] Her work supports the hypothesis that evolution can occur through incremental changes.[4] Recently, Hoekstra has found evidence linking the mutation the Agouti gene to survival in mice. The study showed how a sequence variant in the Agouti gene changes the phenotype and then linked those changes to changes in population allele frequency, demonstrating evolution of trait by natural selection.[13]/nHoekstra lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with her son and her husband, James Mallet.

The character has generated positive critical commentary and academic interest./nDr. Victoria October first appeared in Detective Comics #948, cover dated March 2017.[1]/nDr. October is a trans woman.[2] By her own assessment, she is the planet's foremost expert in \"post-human bioweaponry\",[1][3] and has performed surgery on several bioengineered beings throughout her career.[3] She and Batman knew each other for many years, even before October transitioned from male to female.[1] Before transitioning, she suffered from severe depression and crippling self-doubt and had a \"prickly\" (her word) personality. She believed transitioning would solve her problems.[2][a] Although her new gender did not solve these issues, Dr. October gained emotional and moral strength from the knowledge that she finally knew who she was as a person and could no longer blame her gender misalignment on them.[2] Shortly after its completion, Batman provides her with access to the Belfry, his high-technology headquarters atop Old Wayne Tower in downtown Gotham City.[3][b][c]/nIn the 2016 Batman story arc \"Night of the Monster Men\", the villainous Professor Hugo Strange uses a serum to transform living and dead human beings into horrific monsters. Four of them merge into a composite monster at the end of the story, but it is defeated by Batman, Nightwing, Batwoman, Orphan, Spoiler, and Clayface (Basil Karlo).[9] The government agency A.R.G.U.S. creates a quarantine zone encompassing the neighborhood where the creature died, nicknaming it \"Monstertown\".[1]/nAs a consultant for A.R.G.U.S., Dr. October is in charge of Monstertown, ensuring that no one harvests the bodies to obtain the serum and that animals (such as rats or seagulls) which eat the bodies and become monstrous are contained.[1] Clayface patrols the sewers beneath Monstertown, retrieving for Dr. October monsters created by leaking serum. She then dissects and studies them.[10]/nDr. October makes her second appearance in Detective Comics #959 during the \"Gotham Knights/Batman Eternal\" story arc. At the Belfry, she performs surgery on the bioengineered \"dwarfling\", Nomoz, after he is injured battling the villain Ascalon. At that time, she offers to work on a means of returning Clayface to human form permanently.[3] She asks Clayface to stay in his monstrous form for as long as possible so she can chart the mental degradation he undergoes the longer he remains nonhuman. She also acts as his counselor when he despairs of a cure.[10] Batman has Clayface wear a high-technology forearm device (later replaced with a smaller, longer-lasting wristband)[11] that enables him to regain human form without using his powers\u2014reducing the psychotic effect being Clayface has on Karlo.[12][d][e] The device is not a cure, as the Clayface DNA consumes Basil Karlo's human DNA whenever he is locked into human form.[11] Dr. October gives him a \"placebo\" bracelet with messages from his close friend Cassandra Cain (Orphan), which helps him focus on retaining his sanity. After pushing past the twelve-hour mark, Clayface loses his sanity and attacks Dr. October. Orphan intervenes, saving her life by putting the real bracelet back on.[15]/nVictoria cares deeply for Karlo,[14] and later calls him a \"great friend\".[16]/nI'm always sympathetic to monsters. It's my life's work. I'm used to walking that path alone./nDr. Victoria October, Detective Comics #974 (April 2018),James Tynion IV (writer)/nDr. October expresses a desire to test her cure serum on a less serious case, and Karlo told her of Glory Griffin (the villain Mudface), who was doused in the same chemicals that made Clayface what he is.[2][f] Karlo also tells Glory Griffin about the potential cure, although she refuses to forgive him for what he did to her.[15] Later, with the cure close to being finished, Clayface is captured by Glory when the villain First Victim takes over Arkham Asylum and releases her.[2] Glory removes Clayface's wrist controller, and he goes insane.[20][g]/nAs Clayface races to confront Batman at the Belfry, Col. Jacob Kane[h] gives Batwoman a weapon whose ammunition will destabilize Clayface's molecular structure, killing Karlo. Clayface arrives at Old Wayne Tower, doing significant damage to it. When confronted by Cassandra Cain, Clayface shows empathy and momentarily returns to human form. The Belfry's mudroom collapses, however, dousing him with hundreds of gallons psychoactive mud and driving him insane once more.[14][i] Batman sends Red Robin and Orphan to Monstertown to alert Dr. October to get Karlo's cure ready. She warns the heroes that although the cure will shock Clayface's system and turn him back into Basil Karlo, the effect will only be temporarily due to the massive amounts of psychoactive mud now in his system.[4]/nOrphan manages to inject the cure into Clayface. Her love for him helps Karlo maintain his human form only momentarily. As he assumes his Clayface form, Batwoman shoots him in the head.[4] Dr. October rushes to the site of Karlo's death, and confirms that the psychoactive clay is now inactive and Basil Karlo is dead. Three days later, Dr. October cures Glory Griffin. She accuses Glory of \"taking a repentant man on the brink of salvation and throwing him back into hell\", and says she gave Glory the cure for the sake of Basil Karlo.[16]/nClayface did not die, however. Seven issues later, in Detective Comics #981, readers discover that Basil Karlo is still alive and retains his Clayface powers (at least to some degree). For reasons unstated, Dr. October conspired with him to fake his death. Karlo watches as Cassandra Cain takes up residence at a health clinic in one of Gotham's slums run by Dr. Leslie Thompkins. He leaves a message for her, and then Dr. October drives him out of Gotham City.[21][j]/nThe DC Comics Bombshells series is an alternate reality featuring DC Comics superheroines and supervillains reimagined as bombshells (and a few male heroes as beefcake). The series takes place during World War II.[23][k]/nDr. October makes her first appearance in this alternate reality in DC Comics Bombshells #83. In the Bombshells universe, her name is spelled \"Viktoria\". A Russian citizen, she worked with Ipati Dugan (the Bombshell Universe version of Pat Dugan, the hero known as S.T.R.I.P.E.) on a top-secret cosmonaut program in the years immediately following the Russian Revolution of 1917. Their program was funded by Alexander Luthor. She and Dugan successfully sent Lena Luthor into space. Unfortunately, Lena's ship was lost in time, and Lex Luthor demanded that the Soviet authorities arrest October and Dugan. Dugan was seized and sent into exile, but October escaped.[24] Dr. October somehow continued to find work as an agent of the Soviet government,[25] and became a pioneer in the work of biomechanics and the ethics of bioweaponry.[26] She attended a secret Solvay Conference in 1938 in which Dr. Hugo Strange proposed a worldwide program of eugenics to Dr. October's horror.[27] Just before the war broke out, she attended a \"Conference on the Ethics of Bioweaponry\" in Paris, France, where her presentation was witnessed by Pamela Isley (the Bombshell Universe version of the villain Poison Ivy).[25]/nIn her first appearance in DC Comics Bombshells, Dr. October is living in Leningrad, which was then undergoing the Siege of Leningrad. She meets Harley Quinn and other heroes when Raven magically transports Harley's circus into the city.[25] Dr. October knows that Hugo Strange is now an agent of the Soviet government, and is working on various schemes to help lift the siege.[26] She has been on the alert to any change in the laws of physics which would imply the use of magic, which is what drew her to the Harley group's arrival. Dr. October shows Isley how starvation has affected Leningrad, and Isley uses her powers to create a garden to feed the people of the city.[25]/nDr. October alerts Lois Lane and the others in Harley's group to Hugo Strange's experiments on political prisoners, particularly one bioweapon (the Bombshell Universe version of Power Girl) that appears at night to attack the Nazi army. She gives Lois and Andrea Gr\u00fcener (the Bombshell Universe's female version of Dr. Benjamin Gruener\u2014the villain known as The Reaper) a device to find this bioweapon.[26]/nAfter Supergirl (named Kara Starikov in this reality) liberates Power Girl from Hugo Strange's control, Dr. October helps Supergirl learn more about herself by describing the horrors the people of Leningrad have gone through. In turn, Supergirl reveals that she has been given a kryptonite knife. Dr. October declines to accept the knife, and instead leaves the group off to do more \"humane mad sciencing\".[28] When the Kryptonian refugee Faora kills Raven's father, Trigon, Raven goes mad. Faora steals some of Raven's blood, transforming herself into the Bombshell version of Doomsday. Riding a firebird,[l] Dr. October retrieves Varvara Dugina (Supergirl's adoptive mother) from the American refugee center where she's been hiding, Ipati Dugan (Supergirl's adoptive father) from the Soviet gulag where he was imprisoned, and Samuel Whitmore (biological father of Bombshell Universe's Stargirl)[m] from his home in London. Ipati (transported by a zmei) and Varvara and Samuel (each riding a gamayun) arrive at the scene of battle. Dr. October orders the lesovik, Swamp Thing, to consume Doomsday.[n] Supergirl and the Beefcake Superman destroy the kryptonite knife with their heat-vision, and Zatanna, John Constantine, and Raven to imbue the lesovik, Swamp Thing, with its radioactivity. To make the magic work, Varvara, Ipati, and Whitmore give up their lives, thus imprisoning Doomsday forever inside Swamp Thing.[33]/nDr. October has a cameo in DC Comics Bombshells #100, appearing in Pamela Isley's garden as the Siege of Leningrad is lifted.[34]/nDr. October appears as a young woman with a white forelock streak in her black hair.[1][10] Clayface calls it her Bride of Frankenstein look.[2] When working, she usually wears a white lab coat.[1][10] She prefers black dresses that end above the knee and high-heeled black ankle boots, has a preference for ph\u1edf,[10] and sometimes wears gloves and uses a cane.[1]/nIn the Bombshells Universe, Dr. October continues to wear the same black dress. Instead of a lab coat, she is clad in a knee-length, double-breasted, heavy white winter coat with a wide fur collar. Her ensemble also includes a white boyar hat, knee-high black boots, gloves, and a cane.[25]/nSome readers, Screengeek.net said, felt Dr. October's transgender status should have been more prominently mentioned and Batman's acceptance made more vocal. But Kelsey Loiselle, reviewing Dr. October's early appearances in Detective Comics, argued that writers James Tynion IV and Marguerite Bennett worked hard to ensure that Dr. October's appearances did not \"us[e] transgender conversation to bolster...sales\" but rather used them to discuss the meaning of identity and what it means for superheroes and readers.[35]/nReviewer Andrew Dyce called Dr. October's introduction one of \"beauty, elegance, and dignity\", rather than a \"reveal\" meant to grab headlines and get attention.[36] He praised Dr. October's first two appearances, arguing \"it isn't Detective Comics' goal to simply acknowledge transgender individuals' existence. It's to help every reader understand what gender identity can mean to those outside of the crowd\u2014and just as importantly, what it might not\". He was particularly impressed with the \"power of pronouns\" dialogue in Detective Comics #959, when Dr. October asks the bioengineered being Nomoz for preferred name, pronoun, and species identification. Dyce also pointed to October's conversation with Basil Karlo about whether a cure will get rid of his violence, lack of control, and guilt. The discussion reflects Dr. October's own gender transition, yet shows that this has meaning for non-transgender individuals (and the reader).[37]/nReporter Marissa Higgins, writing for web site The Daily Dot, noted \"how important it is for people to have representation that feels real\". Dialogue in Detective Comics makes Dr. October a \"real\" transgender person by addressing issues fundamental to transgender people: Choosing a new name, deadnaming, and revealing that one is transgender. Higgins applauded how the comic provided these details as character history and avoided making transgender identity \"the all-consuming present and future\" of Dr. October.[38]/nThe manner in which Batman affirms his respect for Dr. October and her gender transition has also drawn positive attention. Andrew Dyce observed that Batman sends Dr. October a card after her gender reassignment\u2014as Batman, not as Bruce Wayne. This puts the imprimatur of the widely loved superhero on gender reassignment.[37] As the \"model of ideal masculinity\", author Jeffrey A. Brown writes, Batman's action enables readers (especially men) to see gender transition as appropriate behavior and transgender individuals as \"perfectly normal\" and worthy of respect.[39]", "70998971": "Karin Dorinda Norlin Rodland (born 1949) is an American cancer cell biologist.

His parents were Mary Maude (n\u00e9e Bratt) and Alan Hailes Spencer Cavalier Smith.[3]/nHe was educated at Norwich School, Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge (MA) and King's College London (PhD). He was under the supervision of Sir John Randall for his PhD thesis between 1964 and 1967; his thesis was entitled \"Organelle Development in Chlamydomonas reinhardii\".[4]/nFrom 1967 to 1969, Cavalier-Smith was a guest investigator at Rockefeller University. He became Lecturer of biophysics at King's College London in 1969. He was promoted to Reader in 1982.\nFrom the early 1980s, Smith promoted views about the taxonomic relationships among living organisms. He was prolific, drawing on a near-unparalleled wealth of information to suggest novel relationships.\nIn 1989 he was appointed Professor of Botany at the University of British Columbia.\nIn 1999, he joined the University of Oxford, becoming Professor of evolutionary biology in 2000.[5]/nThomas Cavalier-Smith died in March\u00a02021 following the development of cancer./nCavalier-Smith was a prolific taxonomist, drawing on a near-unparalleled wealth of information to suggest novel relationships. His suggestions were translated into taxonomic concepts and classifications with which he associated new names, or in some cases, reused old names.\nCavalier-Smith did not follow or espouse an explicit taxonomic philosophy but his approach was closest to evolutionary taxonomy. He and several other colleagues were opposed to cladistic approaches to taxonomy arguing that the goals of cladification and classification were different;[6] his approach was similar to that of many others' broad-based treatments of protists.[7][8]/nThe scope of Cavalier-Smith's taxonomic propositions was grand, but the numbers and composition of the components (taxa), and, often, their relations were not stable. Propositions were often ambiguous and short-lived; he frequently amended taxa without any change in the name. His approach was not universally accepted: Others attempted to underpin taxonomy of protists with a nested series of atomised, falsifiable propositions, following the philosophy of transformed cladistics.[9] However, this approach is no longer considered defensible.[10]/nCavalier-Smith's ideas that led to the taxonomic structures were usually first presented in the form of tables and complex, annotated diagrams. When presented at scientific meetings, they were sometimes too rich, and often written too small, for the ideas to be easily grasped. Some such diagrams made their way into publications, where careful scrutiny was possible, and where the conjectural nature of some assertions was evident. The richness of his ideas, their continuing evolution, and the transition into taxonomies that gave Cavalier-Smith's investigations into evolutionary paths (phylogeny) and the resulting classifications, its distinctive character./nCavalier-Smith was courageous in his adherence to the earlier traditionalist style characterized by Charles Darwin, that of relying on narratives. One example was his advocacy for the Chromista that united lineages that had plastids with chlorophylls a and c (primarily chrysophytes and other stramenopiles, cryptophytes, and haptophytes) despite clear evidence that the group corresponded to a clade./nIt was Cavalier-Smith's claim that there was a single endosymbiotic event by which chlorophyll a c containing plastids were acquired by a common ancestor of all three groups, and that the differences (such as cytological components and their arrangements) among the groups were the result of subsequent evolutionary changes. This interpretation that chromists were monophyletic also required that the heterotrophic (protozoan) members of all three groups had arisen from ancestors with plastids./nThe alternative hypothesis was that the three chromophytic lineages were not closely related (to the exclusion of other lineages) (i.e. were polyphyletic), likely that all were ancestrally without plastids, and that separate symbiotic events established the chlorophyll a/c plastids stramenopiles, cryptomonads and haptophytes. The polyphyly of the chromists has been re-asserted in subsequent studies.[11]/nCavalier-Smith's lack of an objective and reproducible methodology that would translate evolutionary insights into taxa and hierarchical schemes, were often confusing to those who did not follow his publications closely. Many of his taxa requiring his frequent adjustment, as illustrated below. In turn this led to confusion as to the scope of taxa a taxonomic name was applied to./nCavalier-Smith also reused familiar names (such as Protozoa) for innovative taxonomic concepts. This created confusion because Protozoa was and still is used in its old sense,[12] alongside its use in the newer senses. Because of Cavalier-Smith's tendency to publish rapidly and to change his narratives and taxonomic summaries frequently, his approach and claims were frequently debated./nPalaeos.com described his writing style as follows:/nProf. Cavalier-Smith of Oxford University has produced a large body of work which is well regarded. Still, he is controversial in a way that is a bit difficult to describe.  The issue may be one of writing style. Cavalier-Smith has a tendency to make pronouncements where others would use declarative sentences, to use declarative sentences where others would express an opinion, and to express opinions where angels would fear to tread. In addition, he can sound arrogant, reactionary, and even perverse. On the other [hand], he has a long history of being right when everyone else was wrong. To our way of thinking, all of this is overshadowed by one incomparable virtue: the fact that he will grapple with the details. This makes for very long, very complex papers and causes all manner of dark murmuring, tearing of hair, and gnashing of teeth among those tasked with trying to explain his views of early life. See, [for example], Zrzav\u00fd (2001)[13] [and] Patterson (1999).[14][15][16]  Nevertheless, he deals with all of the relevant facts.[17]/n/nCavalier-Smith wrote extensively on the taxonomy and classification of all life forms, but especially protists. One of his major contributions to biology was his proposal of a new kingdom of life: the Chromista, even though it is not widely accepted to be monophyletic (see above)./nHe also introduced new taxonomic groupings group for eukaryotes such as the Chromalveolata (1981), Opisthokonta (1987), Rhizaria (2002), and Excavata (2002). Though well known, many of his claims have been controversial and have not gained widespread acceptance in the scientific community. His taxonomic revisions often influenced the overall classification of all life forms./nCavalier-Smith's first major classification system was the division of all organisms into eight kingdoms. In 1981, he proposed that by completely revising Robert Whittaker's Five Kingdom system, there could be eight kingdoms: Bacteria, Eufungi, Ciliofungi, Animalia, Biliphyta, Viridiplantae, Cryptophyta, and Euglenozoa.[18]/nIn 1983, he revised his system particularly in the light of growing evidence that Archaebacteria were a separate group from Bacteria,[19] to include an array of lineages that had been excluded from his 1981 treatment, to deal with issues of polyphyly, and to promote new ideas of relationships. In addition, some protists lacking mitochondria were discovered.[20] As mitochondria were known to be the result of the endosymbiosis of a proteobacterium, it was thought that these amitochondriate eukaryotes were primitively so, marking an important step in eukaryogenesis. As a result, these amitochondriate protists were given special status as a protozan subkingdom Archezoa, that he later elevated to kingdom status.[20] This was later referred to as the Archezoa hypothesis.[21] In 1993, the eight kingdoms became: Eubacteria, Archaebacteria, Archezoa, Protozoa, Chromista, Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia.[22]/nThe kingdom Archezoa went through many compositional changes due to evidence of polyphyly and paraphyly before being abandoned.[23][24] He assigned some former members of the kingdom Archezoa to the phylum Amoebozoa.[25]/nBy 1998, Cavalier-Smith had reduced the total number of kingdoms from eight to six: Animalia, Protozoa, Fungi, Plantae (including Glaucophyte, red and green algae), Chromista, and Bacteria.[26] Nevertheless, he had already presented this simplified scheme for the first time on his 1981 paper[18] and endorsed it in 1983.[27]/nFive of Cavalier-Smith's kingdoms are classified as eukaryotes as shown in the following scheme:/nThe kingdom Animalia was divided into four subkingdoms: Radiata (phyla Porifera, Cnidaria, Placozoa, and Ctenophora), Myxozoa, Mesozoa, and Bilateria (all other animal phyla)./nHe created three new animal phyla: Acanthognatha (rotifers, acanthocephalans, gastrotrichs, and gnathostomulids), Brachiozoa (brachiopods and phoronids), and Lobopoda (onychophorans and tardigrades)\nand recognised a total of 23\u00a0animal phyla.[26]/nCavalier-Smith's 2003 classification scheme:[28]/nCavalier-Smith and his collaborators revised the classification in 2015, and published it in PLOS ONE. In this scheme they reintroduced the division of prokaryotes into two kingdoms, Bacteria (previously 'Eubacteria') and Archaea (previously 'Archebacteria'). This is based on the consensus in the Taxonomic Outline of Bacteria and Archaea (TOBA) and the Catalogue of Life.[29]/nIn 2006, Cavalier-Smith proposed that the last universal common ancestor to all life was a non-flagellate Gram-negative bacterium (\"negibacterium\") with two membranes (also known as diderm bacterium).[30]/nCavalier-Smith was elected Fellow of the Linnean Society of London (FLS) in 1980, the Institute of Biology (FIBiol) in 1983, the Royal Society of Arts (FRSA) in 1987, the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) in 1988, the Royal Society of Canada (FRSC) in 1997, and the Royal Society of London (FRS) in 1998.[31]/nHe received the International Prize for Biology from the Emperor of Japan in 2004, and the Linnean Medal for Zoology in 2007.

Here we review evidence that the global ecosystem as a whole can react in the same way and is approaching a planetary-scale critical transition as a result of human influence. The plausibility of a planetary-scale 'tipping point' highlights the need to improve biological forecasting by detecting early warning signs of critical transitions on global as well as local scales, and by detecting feedbacks that promote such transitions. It is also necessary to address root causes of how humans are forcing biological changes.[6]", "1727460": "Henrik Kacser FRSE (22 September 1918 \u2013 13 March 1995) was a Romanian-born biochemist and geneticist who worked in Britain in the 20th century. Kacser's achievements have been recognised by his election to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1990, by an honorary doctorate of the University of Bordeaux II in 1993./nHenrik Kacser was born in C\u00e2mpina, Romania, in 1918 to Olga and Soma Kacser, an engineer, both of Austro-Hungarian descent. The family moved to Berlin, where Henrik went to the Tretscher School.[1]/nBefore World War II, for educational reasons he moved to Belfast, Northern Ireland, where he did his undergraduate (BSc 1940, MSc 1942) and postgraduate work (PhD 1949) at the Queen's University of Belfast. There he studied chemistry, specialising in physical chemistry as a postgraduate student. He went to the University of Edinburgh in 1952 as a Nuffield Fellow under a scheme to introduce physical scientists into biology. This was to become the start of his work as a geneticist/biochemist. He earned the Diploma of Animal Genetics, and in 1955 he was appointed to the rank of Lecturer in the Department of Genetics at the University of Edinburgh./nIn most of his research his original training in physical chemistry is quite evident, as he focused mainly on the physical/chemical aspects of biology. Much of his early work includes work on practical chemistry, kinetics of enzyme reactions and very little on genetics. His work \nin this early period attracted little attention, with even the most highly cited paper[2] having only 52 citations by in 65 years. Between 1957 and 1973 he had only four publications,[3] and it would have been easy to conclude that his career was over. However, that would have been completely wrong./nKacser's work falls into four distinct categories: 1. building a foundation in physical chemistry; 2. development of metabolic control analysis; 3. consolidation and 4. expansion. Only in the third phase of his career his expertise in genetics came to light when he set out to find experimental models to demonstrate the correctness of his paper on metabolic control analysis./nKacser's paper with Jim Burns, The control of flux,[4] later thoroughly revised[5] to take account of changes in terminology,[6]  was a landmark paper for both authors.  It described how the rates of metabolic pathways were affected by changes in the amounts or activities of pathway enzymes (See Metabolic Control Analysis).  They showed that the expectation that a metabolic pathway will be controlled by a single pacemaker reaction is a fallacy, and most of the experimental criteria used in the supposed identification of such steps are misleading. Instead, varying amounts of control can be distributed over the enzymes of the pathway, but this is a property of the metabolic system as a whole and cannot be predicted from the characteristics of the enzymes in isolation./nThe molecular basis of dominance (Kacser & Burns, 1981)[7] is the companion paper to The control of flux and reveals the full meaning of its footnote \"the implication of this for the problem of dominance and its evolution will be dealt with in a separate publication\". The connection was that if the flux\u2013enzyme relationship is quasi-hyperbolic, and if, for most enzymes, the wild-type diploid level of enzyme activity occurs where the curve is levelling out, then a heterozygote of the wild-type with a null mutant will have half the enzyme activity but will not exhibit a noticeably reduced flux. Therefore, the wild type appears dominant and the mutant recessive because of the system characteristics of a metabolic pathway./nBy the mid-1980s the central ideas of metabolic control analysis laid out in this paper were becoming far more widely accepted. Further experimental methods based on the theories laid out in the paper were used to help in the understanding of metabolic regulation and molecular evolution, and to show how metabolic control analysis could be applied to problems in medicine and biotechnology. The paper with Richard Beeby 1984 showed how the idea of evolution by natural selection could be applied in a constructive way to provide models for the evolution of enzyme catalysis.[8]/nOther papers include:/nThese papers, in collaboration with Rankin Small and Luis Acerenza, have shown that the prospects for achieving large increases in flux by changing the activity of a single enzyme are poor but a coordinated set of changes, designed by their \"Universal Method\" could make large changes without catastrophic perturbations of the rest of metabolism./nBiochemical interest in the ideas expressed in \"The control of flux\" started to grow in the 1980s, particularly with its experimental applications in Amsterdam to oxidative phosphorylation,[13] urea synthesis and gluconeogenesis.[14]/nAt this time, because the theory of Kacser and Burns and the simultaneous but independent work carried out by Reinhart Heinrich and Tom Rapoport in Berlin were compatible,[15] a common terminology and set of symbols was agreed for the new field of Metabolic Control Analysis.[6]/nOn retiring from lecturing in 1988 he became a Fellow of the University of Edinburgh.

However, details of the process were not understood[21] until R. Michael Roberts and Fuller W.

He proposed a developmental switch to explain the formation of trophectoderm during early embryo development. He has identified more than 100 expressed genes for proteins in the aspartyl proteinase gene family, associated with pregnancy.[21] This work has formed the basis for developing a  pregnancy test for dairy cattle.[25] His research on sexual dimorphism in embryos suggests that maternal diet around conception may influence an offspring\u2019s sex.[21]/nRoberts changed research direction in 2003.[26] He began to focus on the use of pluripotent stem cells and the development of models to study the emergence and differentiation of animal and human trophoblast.[27] Among his group's contributions is a study on the importance of low oxygen atmospheres to control human stem cell differentiation.[28] His laboratory was one of the first to describe the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from an ungulate species, the pig.

Shimada (January 17, 1922 - June 2, 1958) was an American fisheries scientist. He is noted for his study during the 1950s of tuna stocks in the tropical Pacific Ocean and its important effect on the development of the post-World War II tuna fishery on the United States West Coast.[1][2]/nBell Masayuki Shimada was born in Seattle, Washington, on January 17, 1922, to Japanese immigrant parents.[3][1] As a boy, he demonstrated an aptitude for mathematics and science. After graduating from Franklin High School, he attended the University of Washington, where he studied at the School of Fisheries.[1][2]/nThe United States entered World War II with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Early in the war, concerns arose in the United States that Japanese-Americans might sympathize with Japan, leading to a program of  internment of Japanese-Americans which involved \"evacuating\" them involuntarily from the United States West Coast and incarcerating them in inland concentration camps. This interrupted Shimada's studies when he was \"evacuated\" on April 27, 1942.[1] He was incarcerated at Minidoka in Idaho on April 29, 1942.[2][4]/nIn May 1943, Shimada was permitted to leave the camp and enlist in the United States Army as an infantryman[1][2] in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team.[2] After basic training at Camp Shelby in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, he was selected for Japanese language and military intelligence collection training at Camp Savage in Savage, Minnesota. In April 1944, he was transferred to the United States Army Air Forces and received three months of air intelligence training in Orlando, Florida. He then was transferred to Honolulu, Hawaii, where he served as a translator and interpreter until May 1945, when he was transferred to Guam, where he served as a radio traffic monitor until the surrender of Japan on August 15, 1945.[1][2]/nIn August 1945, Shimada moved to U.S. Army Air Forces headquarters in Tokyo to take part in the occupation of Japan. He collected and synthesized economic and infrastructure data on the effects of the strategic bombing of Japan until he was discharged from the military in February 1946.[1][2]/nRemaining in Japan, Shimada accepted a civilian position as a fisheries biologist in the Natural Resources Section on the staff of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP). His duties involved researching and analyzing Japanese fisheries activities and compiling and collating data on them. He played a major role in drafting SCAP directives to the Japanese government, particularly on whaling, and his first professional publication, Japanese Whaling in the Bonin Islands Area (United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Fishery Leaflet No. 248), published in 1947, was based on his studies and reports on whaling while he was in Japan.[1][2]/nLeaving Japan in December 1946, Shimada returned to the University of Washington to resume his studies at the College of Fisheries. He also worked as a laboratory technician for the School of Fisheries and maintained the School's ichthyology collection. After graduating cum laude on December 20, 1947, and receiving his bachelor's degree, he remained at the School of Fisheries to pursue postgraduate studies, during which he worked as a laboratory assistant maintaining aquaculture facilities for the Atomic Energy Commission. In September 1948, he began his career with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, accepting a position in its Bureau of Fisheries.[1][2]/nShimada graduated from the University of Washington School of Fisheries postgraduate program with a Master of Science in Fisheries in December 1948, and the same month moved to Honolulu to work for the Fish and Wildlife Service's new Pacific Ocean Fishery Investigations (POFI) office.[1][2] Tuna stocks in the Pacific Ocean had come under increasing pressure since the end of World War II, and the Fish and Wildlife Service had created POFI to study the tuna fishery in the equatorial Pacific. POFI's first director, the influential fisheries scientist Oscar Elton Sette, arrived in Honolulu to take charge of POFI in 1949. Sette has been credited with pioneering modern fisheries science by integrating the biological study of fish and their life cycles and populations with oceanography and meteorology to develop an overall understanding not only of the biology of the fish themselves but also of the influence of the physical environment on fisheries and fluctuations in their abundance from year to year.[5][6] Sette organized and directed POFI according to this vision.[5][6]/nUnder Sette's guidance, Shimada worked with many accomplished fisheries scientists and oceanographers while at POFI, including Wilbert McLeod \"Wib\" Chapman, Roger Revelle, Milner Baily \"Benny\" Schaefer, and Sette himself, as well as young scientists who would become notable in their fields as their careers progressed, such as Townsend Cromwell, Fred Cleaver, Warren Wooster, Alan Tubbs, William Aron, Gerald Howard, Richard Hennemuth, Howard Yoshida, and Tom Hida.[1] The Fish and Wildlife Service assigned two research ships to support POFI, and Shimada served as a seagoing biologist, in charge of shipboard science watches and research.[1]/nShimada also took postgraduate courses while in Honolulu and began work on his Ph.D.[1] He left POFI in January 1951 and spent the rest of the year in Seattle taking doctoral courses at the School of Fisheries at the University of Washington.[1][2]/nIn February 1952, Shimada was assigned to the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC),[1][2] which was collocated with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the Fish and Wildlife Service Bureau of Fisheries laboratory in La Jolla, California, and he cooperated professionally with those institutions on matters of mutual interest, sharing scientific ideas and manpower and cooperating in research. Working with Milner \"Benny\" Schaefer and Gerald Howard, Shimada conducted the tuna fishery research for which he is best known during his time with the IATTC and achieved national and international recognition when he began to publish his research on tuna spawning, distribution, and feeding patterns.[1][2] He received his doctorate from the University of Washington School of Fisheries in 1956,[1][2] and rose rapidly within the IATTC, serving as the IATTC's Senior Scientist from 1956 to 1958.  Both at POFI and at IATTC, Shimada worked frequently with Townsend Cromwell, a physical oceanographer interested in ocean currents, on research into the distribution of tuna in the Pacific Ocean. Their cooperative work, following the principles of fisheries oceanography Sette, Shimada, Cromwell, and other members of Sette's team had pioneered at POFI, combined Cromwell's insights into the forces such as temperature gradients that drive currents with Shimada's findings regarding the availability of forage for the tunas, leading to useful research results for both men.[1]/nIn 1957, Shimada and Cromwell worked together on the distribution of tuna throughout the Pacific Ocean,[2] including a research ship cruise off Mexico's Clarion Island as part of a project for the IATTC known as the Island Current Study.[1] Plans called for Shimada and Cromwell to make one more cruise to Clarion Island in 1958 aboard the Scripps Institution research ship Horizon to continue their research there before Shimada left the IATTC to take up a position as the first director of the Fish and Wildlife Service Bureau of Commercial Fisheries' new Eastern Pacific Tuna Investigations office in July 1958.[1]/nMaking their way to Acapulco, Mexico, to join their research team for the 1958 Clarion Island cruise, Shimada and Cromwell boarded Aeronaves de M\u00e9xico Flight 111, a Lockheed L-749A Constellation, in Guadalajara, Mexico, on June 2, 1958, for a flight to Mexico City. Shortly after takeoff, the airliner crashed into La Latilla Mountain, only 16 kilometers (10 miles) from Guadalajara Airport, killing all 45 people on board in what at the time was Mexico's deadliest aviation accident.[1][2][7]/nShimada is buried at Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park in Seattle, Washington.[3]/nWhile working with POFI in Hawaii between 1948 and 1952, Shimada met and married the former Rae M. Shimojima (March 5, 1919 \u2013 May 20, 1996),[1][8] who was working as Sette's secretary at the time.[2] They had a son, Allen, born in 1954, and a daughter, Julie, born in 1957.[1] Allen Shimada later became a fisheries scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service.[9]/nAlthough Shimada died at the age of 36 and his fisheries science career lasted only 12 years, at the time of his death the fisheries science community already viewed his contributions as so significant to both the scientific understanding of the Pacific tuna fishery and to the post-World War II development of that fishery on the U.S. West Coast that the Proceedings from the Symposium on \"The Changing Pacific Ocean in 1957 and 1958\" were dedicated to him,[1][10] as well as to Townsend Cromwell.[10] The dedication read:/nThis Symposium is dedicated to Townsend Cromwell and Bell M.

He studied botany, zoology, chemistry and bacteriology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1938 he received an MSc, and in 1941 he received a PhD degree.[4] In 1939, he graduated from the first Haganah officers' course, and became commander of the student unit in the field forces (Hish)./nHe and his brother worked on the development of new methods of warfare. In late 1947, after the outbreak of the 1948 Palestine war, and in anticipation of  the War for Israel\u2019s Independence, Katzir  met the biochemist David Rittenberg, then working at Columbia University, stating:\u2019 \u2018I need germs and poisons for the [impending/ongoing Israeli] war of independence,\u2019 Rittenberg referred the matter to Chaim Weizmann. Weizmann initially dismissed the request, branding Katzir a \u2018savage\u2019 and requested his dismissal from the Sieff Scientific Institute in Rehovot, but weeks later he relented, and his dismissal was rescinded. Shortly afterwards, in March 1948, his brother Aharon, who decades later was one of the victims of the Lod Airport Massacre, was appointed director of a research unit, HEMED, in Mandatory Palestine involving biological warfare. A decision to use such material against Palestinians was then taken in early April.[6] In May Ben-Gurion appointed Ephraim to replace his brother as director of HEMED, given his success abroad in procuring biological warfare materials and equipment to produce them.[7]/nKatzir was married to Nina (n\u00e9e Gottlieb), born in Poland, who died in 1986.

He is most noted for his early experimental work in embryology and for his neo-vitalist philosophy of entelechy. He has also been credited with performing the first artificial 'cloning' of an animal in the 1880s, although this claim is dependent on how one defines cloning.[2]/nDriesch was educated at the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums. He began to study medicine in 1886 under August Weismann at the University of Freiburg. In 1887 he attended the University of Jena under Ernst Haeckel, Oscar Hertwig and Christian Ernst Stahl. In 1888 he studied physics and chemistry at the University of Munich. He received his doctorate in 1889. He travelled widely on field and study trips and lecture-tours, visiting Plymouth, India, Zurich and Leipzig where, in 1894, he published his Analytische Theorie der organischen Entwicklung or Analytic Theory of Organic Development. His interests encompassed mathematics, philosophy and physics as well as biology. He married Margarete Relfferschneidt, and the couple had two children./nFrom 1891 Driesch worked in Naples at the Marine Biological Station, where until 1901 he continued to experiment and seek a theoretical formulation of his results. He enquired into classical and modern philosophy in his search for an adequate theoretical overview[3] and ended by adopting an Aristotlean teleological theory of entelechy./nUnder the influence of his teacher Haeckel, Driesch had tested the mechanistic embryological theories of another of Haeckel's students, Wilhelm Roux. Driesch studied sea urchin embryos, and found that when he separated the two cells of the embryo after the first cell-division, each developed into a complete sea urchin. This was contrary to his expectation that each cell would develop into the corresponding half of the animal, a prediction based on Wilhelm Roux's earlier work with frog embryos. This also happened at the four-cell stage: entire larvae ensued from each of the four cells, albeit smaller than usual. By 1885 Driesch's experiments on the sea urchin embryo showed that it was even possible to shuffle the blastomeres of the early embryo without affecting the resulting larva./nThese findings suggested that any single cell in the early embryo was capable of forming any part of the developing larva. This seemed to be an important refutation of both early preformation ideas and the later mosaic theory of Wilhelm Roux, and was to be subject to much discussion in the ensuing years. The conclusion caused friction among Driesch, Roux and Haeckel.[4] Driesch's findings brought about the adoption of the terms \"totipotent\" and \"pluripotent\" cell, referring respectively to a cell that can generate every cell in an organism and one that can generate nearly every cell./nDriesch's results were confirmed with greater precision, and the experiments extended, by Sven H\u00f6rstadius who showed that conclusions of equivalence between sea urchin embryonic cells were an over-simplification./nDriesch, believing that his results compromised contemporary mechanistic theories of ontogeny, instead proposed that the autonomy of life that he deduced from this persistence of embryological development despite interferences was due to what he called entelechy, a term borrowed from Aristotle's philosophy to indicate a life force which he conceived of as psychoid or \"mind-like\", that is; non-spatial, intensive, and qualitative rather than spatial, extensive, and quantitative./nDriesch was awarded the chair of natural theology at the University of Aberdeen, where he delivered the Gifford Lectures in 1906 and 1908 on The Science and Philosophy of the Organism - the first comprehensive presentation of his ideas. From 1909, determined to take up a career in academic philosophy, he taught natural philosophy at the Faculty of Natural Sciences in Heidelberg. In the ensuing decade he published a complete system of philosophy in three volumes, including his fundamental Theory of Order (1912) in which he proposed a three-part \"doctrine of order\"./nIn 1919 he was ordinary professor of systematic philosophy at Cologne and in 1921 professor of philosophy at Leipzig, though he was a visiting professor in Nanjing and Beijing during 1922-23, and in 1923 he received honorable doctor's degree from National Southeastern University (later renamed National Central University and Nanjing University) where he taught for a semester. He taught at the University of Wisconsin (1926\u201327) and in Buenos Aires (1928). In 1933 he was removed from his Leipzig chair and prematurely placed in emeritus status by the Nazi administration,[5] the first non-Jewish academic to be thus expelled, because of his pacifism and open hostility to Nazism. He became interested in parapsychology and published on such phenomena as telepathy, clairvoyance, and telekinesis./nHis concept of entelechy was criticized by the scientific community. Biologist J. W. Jenkinson wrote that Dreisch was inventing new entities \"beyond necessity and the progress of science would be better served by a simpler philosophy.\"[6] Zoologist Herbert Spencer Jennings commented that the concept of entelechy \"does not help in our understanding of matters in the least.\"[7]/nHis vitalist writings were criticized by historian Ruth Brandon for being based on a religious rather than an objective scientific standpoint.[8]/nDriesch developed a deep interest in Psychical Research and Parapsychology.  In 1931, he published a methodology of parapsychological research (in German) and in 1933 he published a book on the topic titled Psychical Research: The Science of the Super-normal.

In 2013 he returned to his native Italy where he continued to unravel the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial dynamics and their pathophysiological consequences./nHe has been prolific in his contributions to the fields of apoptosis and mitochondrial pathophysiology,[3][4][5] as well as mitochondrial dynamics and interorganellar contact sites. His lab identified the role of Opa1, optic atrophy protein 1, in holding mitochondrial cristae junctions tight,[6][7] which is an important determinant of mitochondrial respiratory efficiency.[8] His lab also found augmentation of Opa1 to correct mitochondrial diseases and blunt muscular atrophy,[9] stroke and heart ischemia.[10] In 2008, Scorrano's lab identified Mfn2, a protein mutated in a peripheral neuropathy, as the first molecular bridge between endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria.[11] His notable work contributed to the current understanding of how mitochondrial shape and structure influence cellular processes and cellular homeostasis.[12][13]/nHis lab is now focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms and pathophysiological consequences of mitochondrial dynamics and contacts with the ER in health and disease./nScorrano received several prizes and awards, including the Eppendorf European Young Investigator, the Chiara D\u2019Onofrio and the ESCI Award.

Her chief discoveries include describing Mendelian sleep phenotypes, identifying causative genes and mutations for circadian rhythm disorders, and characterizing genetic forms of demyelinating degenerative disorders. Fu is currently a professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco. She was elected to the US National Academy of Sciences in 2018.[1]/nIn 1980, Fu received a degree in food science from National Chung Hsing University in Taiwan. In her study of food sciences, she was introduced to biochemistry and microbiology, which led her to study DNA manipulation. She then received her Ph.D. in biochemistry and molecular biology from Ohio State University in 1986. She continued to work at OSU for three more years in a post-doctoral position studying gene regulation in fungi. During her time at OSU, she cloned numerous genes important for nitrogen and sulfur metabolism in Neurospora. One of these genes, cys-3, encodes a leucine zipper protein. It was hypothesized that leucine zippers were DNA-binding elements. The first proof of this in living organisms was a mutation in the cys-3 leucine zipper, which caused a sulfur metabolism defect. After studying the mutation, Fu demonstrated that the mutated cys-3 was unable to bind DNA.[2]/nIn 1989, Fu transferred to the Baylor College of Medicine as a post-doctoral fellow to study human genetics.[3] While there, she was part of the team that identified the fragile-X syndrome gene. The gene contains a polymorphic CGG trinucleotide repeat in their DNA sequence; the repeat ranged from 6 to 54 in individuals with normal X chromosomes. The transition from stable to unstable occurred between 46 and 52 repeats. The instability increases the likelihood of fragile-X mental retardation.[4] The repeats have a tendency to expand in transmission through meiosis. The size of the repeat correlates with severity of the disease.[5] Fu cloned one of the genes responsible for a form of muscular dystrophy called myotonic dystrophy, and showed that an expanded trinucleotide repeat in this gene also was unstable and caused the disease. Together, these discoveries characterized the molecular basis of genetic \u201canticipation,\u201d the phenomenon of worsening severity in subsequent generations, as being due to unstable, expanded trinucleotide repeats.[6]/nAfter her postdoc position, Fu worked in biotech industry for four years before returning to academia. She worked first for two years from January 1993 - 1995 at Millennium Pharmaceutical Corporation, a biopharmaceutical company focused on oncology and inflammation (later acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company). After leaving Millennium Pharmaceutical, from 1995- August 1997 Fu worked for Darwin Molecular Corporation for two years and took part in the search for mutations responsible for premature aging (Werner syndrome) and early onset Alzheimer's disease (presenilin 2).[2]/nIn 1997, Fu returned to academia, taking the position of associate professor of research at the University of Utah. Fu was then recruited to the University of California, San Francisco in 2002, where she is a co-principal investigator (PI) with her collaborator, Louis Ptacek.[3] The lab's current projects include: locating human sleep genes, uncovering the molecular mechanisms of human sleep regulation and human circadian rhythms, investigating mouse models with de/dys-myelinating disease, and classifying miRNAs that contribute to healthy myelin./nFu had her training in molecular biology and human genetics, but she became interested in circadian rhythms in 1996 when a woman came into a sleep clinic at the University of Utah, complaining that she had to go to bed very early and would wake up very early. This woman and her family would become the subject of study for Fu and her collaborator Louis Ptacek for familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS). They cloned the causative gene/mutation and studied the in vitro biochemical consequences of the mutation, culminating in a 2001 paper[7] An hPer2 phosphorylation site mutation in familial advanced sleep-phase syndrome, reporting the first circadian gene mutation in humans.[8]/nIn 2001, Fu and her collaborator's labs published a paper that explained a phenotype of extremely early risers in humans called Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (FASPS).[9] Humans with this autosomal dominant disease typically go to bed around 7:00\u00a0p.m. and wake up at 3:00\u00a0a.m. The lab studied the genomes of people with this trait and found a point mutation in the PER2 gene that likely causes the behavioral phenotype./nIn 2009, Fu's group published a paper that explained the mechanisms of a short sleep phenotype in humans.[10] In one family, carriers of the  autosomal dominant phenotype sleep 6.25 hours compared to non-carrying family members, who sleep more than 8 hours per night. Fu traced the phenotype back to a point mutation in a gene called DEC2 that is associated with short sleep phenotype in humans. The mutant DEC2 has a proline-to-arginine switch at amino acid position 384, which causes the short sleep phenotype. Transgenic mice and flies with the mutant DEC2 showed similar phenotypes. It is not currently known what other molecules DEC2 interacts with to produce the short sleep phenotype./nWhen Fu did her post-doctoral work in Baylor College, she was part of the team that was positional cloning the Fragile-X syndrome gene. There, she studied the trinucleotide repeat sequence expansions, the mutations responsible for the Fragile-X Syndrome, and their correlation with disease severity and age of onset. This work led to the discovery of underlying molecular mechanism for genetic anticipation.  Following this work, she cloned the gene responsible for Myotonic dystrophy based on the hypothesis that genetic anticipation in Myotonic dystrophy is also caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion on patient DNA. This mutational mechanism is now known to cause not only Fragile X syndrome and Myotonic dystrophy, but also Huntington's disease and many of the spinocerebellar ataxias. Thus, it is a common mutational mechanism in inherited neurological diseases.[11]/nIn 2006, Fu's lab published a paper characterizing a mutation that led to ADLD in humans. Adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a neurological disorder that is associated with widespread myelin loss in the central nervous system. Fu's lab traced the phenotype back to individuals with an extra copy of nuclear laminar protein lamin B1 making ADLD one of the diseases named \u201claminopathies\u201d.[12]", "70016174": "Stanislav Vladimirovich Drobyshevsky (Russian: \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0414\u0440\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439; born 2 July 1978)\u00a0is a Russian anthropologist and science popularizer.

Duesberg (born December 2, 1936) is a German-American molecular biologist and a professor of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley. He is known for his early research into the genetic aspects of cancer. He is a proponent of AIDS denialism, the claim that HIV does not cause AIDS./nDuesberg received acclaim early in his career for research on oncogenes and cancer. With Peter K. Vogt, he reported in 1970 that a cancer-causing virus of birds had extra genetic material compared with non-cancer-causing viruses, hypothesizing that this material contributed to cancer.[1][2] At the age of 36, Duesberg was awarded tenure at the University of California, Berkeley, and at 49, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. He received an Outstanding Investigator Grant from the National Institutes of Health in 1986,[3] and from 1986 to 1987 was a Fogarty scholar-in-residence at the NIH laboratories in Bethesda, Maryland./nLong considered a contrarian by his scientific colleagues,[4] Duesberg began to gain public notoriety with a March 1987 article in Cancer Research entitled \"Retroviruses as Carcinogens and Pathogens: Expectations and Reality\".[5] In this and subsequent writings, Duesberg proposed his hypothesis that AIDS is caused by long-term consumption of recreational drugs or antiretroviral drugs, and that the retrovirus known as 'HIV' is a harmless passenger virus. In contrast, the scientific consensus is that HIV infection causes AIDS;[6] Duesberg's HIV/AIDS claims have been addressed and rejected as erroneous by the scientific community.[7][8][9] Reviews of his opinions in Nature[10] and Science[11] asserted that they were unpersuasive and based on selective reading of the literature, and that although Duesberg had a right to a dissenting opinion, his failure to fairly review evidence that HIV causes AIDS meant that his opinion lacked credibility.[11][12]/nDuesberg's views are cited as major influences on South African HIV/AIDS policy under the administration of Thabo Mbeki, which embraced AIDS denialism. Duesberg served on an advisory panel to Mbeki convened in 2000. The Mbeki administration's failure to provide antiretroviral drugs in a timely manner, due in part to the influence of AIDS denialism, is thought to be responsible for hundreds of thousands of preventable AIDS deaths and HIV infections in South Africa.[13][14] Duesberg disputed these findings in an article in the journal Medical Hypotheses,[15] but the journal's publisher, Elsevier, later retracted Duesberg's article over accuracy and ethics concerns as well as its rejection during peer review.[16][17] The incident prompted several complaints to Duesberg's institution, the University of California, Berkeley, which began a misconduct investigation of Duesberg in 2009.[18][19] The investigation was dropped in 2010, with university officials finding \"insufficient evidence ... to support a recommendation for disciplinary action.\"[20][21]/nDuesberg grew up during World War II, raised as a Catholic in Germany.[22] He moved to the US in 1964 to work at the University of California, Berkeley, following completion of a Ph.D. in chemistry at the University of Frankfurt.[22]/nIn the 1970s, Duesberg won international acclaim for his groundbreaking work on cancer.[23] Duesberg's early work on cancer included being the first to identify the oncogene v-src from the genome of Rous sarcoma virus, a chicken virus believed to trigger tumor growth.[22] Duesberg disputes the importance of oncogenes and retroviruses in cancer. He supports the aneuploidy hypothesis of cancer that was first proposed in 1914 by Theodor Heinrich Boveri.[22][24]/nDuesberg rejects the importance of mutations, oncogenes, and anti-oncogenes entirely. Duesberg along with other researchers, in a 1998 paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reported a mathematical correlation between chromosome number and the genetic instability of cancer cells, which they dubbed \"the ploidy factor,\"[25] confirming earlier research by other groups[26] that demonstrated an association between degree of aneuploidy and metastasis./nAlthough unwilling to concur with Duesberg in throwing out a role for cancer genes, many researchers do support exploration of alternative hypotheses.[27] Research and debate on this subject is ongoing. In 2007, Scientific American published an article by Duesberg on his aneuploidy cancer theory.[28] In an editorial explaining their decision to publish this article, the editors of Scientific American stated: \"Thus, as wrong as Duesberg surely is about HIV, there is at least a chance that he is significantly right about cancer.\"[29]/nA consequence of Duesberg's aneuploidy theory of cancer is his opposition to Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccination,[30] as Duesberg has challenged the causal relation between past HPV infection and the eventual development of cervical cancer.[31] Although Duesberg generally favors vaccination, he vehemently opposed the rollout of the HPV vaccine stating it was all risk and no benefit.[32]/nIn his 1996 book, Inventing the AIDS Virus, published by Regnery Publishing, a politically conservative book publisher based in Washington, D.C., and in numerous journal articles and letters to the editor, Duesberg asserts that HIV is harmless and that recreational and pharmaceutical drug use, especially of zidovudine (AZT, a drug used in the treatment of AIDS) are the causes of AIDS outside Africa (the so-called Duesberg hypothesis). He considers AIDS diseases as markers for drug use, e.g., use of poppers (alkyl nitrites) among some homosexuals, asserting a correlation between AIDS and recreational drug use.[33] This correlation hypothesis has been disproven by evidence showing that only HIV infection, not homosexuality or recreational/pharmaceutical drug use, predicts who will develop AIDS.[6][8][34][35][36]/nDuesberg asserts that AIDS in Africa is misdiagnosed and the epidemic a \"myth\", claiming incorrectly[37] that the diagnostic criteria for AIDS are different in Africa than elsewhere.[38][39], and that the breakdown of the immune system in African AIDS patients can be explained exclusively by factors such as malnutrition, tainted drinking water, and various infections that he presumes are common to AIDS patients in Africa.[39] Duesberg also argues that retroviruses like HIV must be harmless to survive, and that the normal mode of retroviral propagation is mother-to-child transmission by infection in utero.[40]/nSince Duesberg published his first paper on the subject in 1987, scientists have examined and criticized the accuracy of his hypotheses on AIDS causation. Duesberg entered a long dispute with John Maddox, then-editor of the scientific journal Nature, demanding the right to rebut articles that HIV caused AIDS.  For several years Maddox consented to this demand[10] but ultimately refused to continue to publish Duesberg's criticisms:/n[Duesberg] forfeited the right to expect answers by his rhetorical technique. Questions left unanswered for more than about ten minutes he takes as further proof that HIV is not the cause of AIDS. Evidence that contradicts his alternative drug hypothesis is on the other hand brushed aside...Duesberg will not be alone in protesting that this is merely a recipe for suppressing challenges to received wisdom. So it can be. But Nature will not so use it. Instead, what Duesberg continues to say about the causation of AIDS will be reported in the general interest. When he offers a text for publication that can be authenticated, it will if possible be published./nA number of scientific criticisms of Duesberg's hypothesis were summarized in a review article in the journal Science in 1994, which presented the results of a 3-month scientific investigation into some of Duesberg's claims.  In the Science article, science writer Jon Cohen interviewed both HIV researchers and AIDS denialists (including Duesberg himself) and examined the AIDS literature in addition to review articles written by Duesberg. The article stated:/n...although the Berkeley virologist raises provocative questions, few researchers find his basic contention that HIV is not the cause of AIDS persuasive. Mainstream AIDS researchers argue that Duesberg's arguments are constructed by a selective reading of the scientific literature, dismissing evidence that contradicts his theses, requiring impossibly definitive proof, and dismissing outright studies marked by inconsequential weaknesses./nThe article also stated that Duesberg and the AIDS denialist movement have garnered support from some prominent scientists, including Nobel Prize winner Kary Mullis, while others are cited as \"equally, if not more, concerned about the treatment Duesberg has received at the hands of the establishment\", rather than support of his specific claim that HIV does not cause AIDS.[11] Duesberg has been described as \"the individual who has done the most damage\" regarding denialism, due to the apparent scientific legitimacy his scientific credentials give to his statements.[7]/nIn a 2010 article on conspiracy theories in science, Ted Goertzel highlights Duesberg's opposition to the HIV/AIDS connection as an example in which scientific findings are disputed on irrational grounds, relying on rhetoric, appeal to fairness and the right to a dissenting opinion rather than on evidence.  Goertzel stated that Duesberg, along with many other denialists frequently invoke the meme of a \"courageous independent scientist resisting orthodoxy\", invoking the name of persecuted physicist and astronomer Galileo Galilei.[10] Regarding this comparison, Goertzel stated:/n...being a dissenter from orthodoxy is not difficult; the hard part is actually having a better theory. Publishing dissenting theories is important when they are backed by plausible evidence, but this does not mean giving critics 'equal time' to dissent from every finding by a mainstream scientist./nDuesberg's advocacy of AIDS denialism has, by all accounts, effectively made him a pariah to the worldwide scientific community.[4]/nIn 2000, Duesberg was the most prominent AIDS denialist to sit on a 44-member Presidential Advisory Panel on HIV and AIDS convened by then-president Thabo Mbeki of South Africa.[41] The panel was scheduled to meet concurrently with the 2000 International AIDS Conference in Durban and to convey the impression that Mbeki's doubts about HIV/AIDS science were valid and actively discussed in the scientific community.[14]/nThe views of the denialists on the panel, aired during the AIDS conference, received renewed attention.[42] Mbeki later suffered substantial political fallout for his support for AIDS denialism[43][44] and for opposing the treatment of pregnant HIV-positive South African women with antiretroviral medication.[45] Mbeki partly attenuated his ties with denialists in 2002, asking them to stop associating their names with his.[46]/nIn response to the inclusion of AIDS denialists on Mbeki's panel, the Durban Declaration was drafted and signed by over 5,000 scientists and physicians, describing the evidence that HIV causes AIDS as \"clear-cut, exhaustive and unambiguous\".[47]/nTwo independent studies have concluded that the public health policies of Thabo Mbeki's government, shaped in part by Duesberg's writings and advice, were responsible for over 330,000 excess AIDS deaths and many preventable infections, including those of infants.[13][14]/nA 2008 feature story on Duesberg in Discover addresses Duesberg's role in anti-HIV drug-preventable deaths in South Africa. Jeanne Lenzer interviews prominent HIV/AIDS expert Max Essex, who suggests that,/n...history will judge Duesberg as either \"a nut who is just a tease to the scientific community\" or an \"enabler to mass murder\" for the deaths of many AIDS patients in Africa.[4]/nIn 2009, Duesberg and co-authors including David Rasnick published an article in Medical Hypotheses, an unconventionally peer reviewed journal. The article, HIV-AIDS hypothesis out of touch with South African AIDS \u2013 A new perspective, had been rejected previously by the journal JAIDS, and a peer reviewer had warned that the authors could face scientific misconduct charges if the paper were published./nThe reviewers claimed that Duesberg and his co-authors cherry-picked data, cited favorable results while ignoring unfavorable results, and quoted statements out of context. The article was not revised in response to these criticisms. Moreover, the reviewers claim that Duesberg, though he included in the article that neither he nor his co-authors had financial conflicts of interest, \"[committed] a serious breach of professional ethics\" by failing to state a possible conflict of interest: That co-author Rasnick previously worked for Matthias Rath, a vitamin entrepreneur who sold vitamin pills as AIDS remedies.[19]/nIn the article, Duesberg questioned research reporting that drug policies implemented by the South African government on the advice of Duesberg, Rasnick and others had led to excess AIDS deaths.[15] Observing that the overall population of South Africa has increased, Duesberg claimed that HIV must be a harmless \"passenger virus\" that has not caused deaths in South Africa or elsewhere. Duesberg stated that HIV does not replicate in the body and that antiviral drugs, which he calls \"inevitably toxic,\" do not inhibit HIV.[15]/nScientists expressed concerns to Elsevier, the publisher of Medical Hypotheses, about unsupported assertions and incorrect statements by Duesberg. After an internal review and with a unanimous recommendation of rejection by five Lancet reviewers, Elsevier stated that the article was flawed and of potential danger to global public health.[15] Elsevier permanently withdrew[48] the Duesberg article and another AIDS denialist publication and asked that the editor of the journal implement a conventional peer review process.[16][17][49]/nLetters of complaint to the University of California, Berkeley, including one from Nathan Geffen of the South African Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), prompted university officials to open an inquiry into possible academic misconduct related to false statements and failure to disclose potential conflicts of interest.[18][19] The investigation was dropped in 2010, with university officials finding \"insufficient evidence...to support a recommendation for disciplinary action.\" The investigation did not evaluate the merits of the research but found that publishing the article was protected by the principle of academic freedom.[20]", "13884612": "Frederick Merkle Bayer (October 31, 1921 \u2014 October 2, 2007) was an emeritus curator of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, as well as a prominent marine biologist who specialized in the study of soft corals.[1]/nFrederick Bayer was born on Halloween night 1921,[2] in Asbury Park, New Jersey,[1] but spent much of his childhood in south Florida, where he collected seashells and became an amateur naturalist.[1]/nBayer joined the Army Air Forces from December 1942 to December 1945.

The pursuit of anti-RAS therapeutic strategies has been a major focus of his research studies.[4]/nA second was that RAS oncoprotein function is dependent on modification by a farnesyl isoprenoid lipid group.[5] This discovery prompted intense pharmaceutical industry pursuit of inhibitors of the farnesyltransferase enzyme that catalyzes this lipid modification on RAS and other proteins.[6] This has led to a current Phase 2 clinical trial using farnesyltransferase inhibitors to inhibit HRAS-driven head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. In collaborative studies with Francis Collins, MD (former Director, National Institutes of Health), he also demonstrated that these inhibitors corrected the protein defect that causes progeria, a disease of \u201crapid aging\u201d.[7] This discovery set the stage for the recent FDA approval of farnesyltransferase inhibitors as the only treatment for this rare childhood disease. \nA third finding is the discovery of a therapeutic approach that ERK inhibition increases pancreatic cancer addiction to autophagy. Autophagy, derived from the Greek meaning \u201ceating of self\u201d, is a process whereby cancer cells acquire the energy needed to maintain their high growth capacity.

Until his retirement in 1986 he was professor of botany at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.[3]/nHis most important research topics were photosynthesis, plant carbohydrate metabolism, analysis of the structure of bacterial cell walls (murein/peptidoglycan), the systematics of Lactobacillus, and the chemotaxonomy of plants and microorganisms.[1][3]\nHe presented the first experimental evidence for the existence of photophosphorylation in vivo.[4] His discovery of the basic differences between the cell walls of bacteria and archaea (up to 1990 called \"archaebacteria\") convinced him that archaea represent an autonomous group of organisms distinct from bacteria.[5][6] This was the basis for his cooperation with Carl Woese and made him the founder of research on the Archaea in Germany. In 1990, together with Woese, he proposed the three domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea, Eucarya.[7] Finally, on the basis of his lifelong interest in the early evolution and diversification of life on this planet, Kandler presented his pre-cell theory, suggesting that the three domains of life did not emerge from an ancestral cell, e.g. the last universal common ancestor (LUCA), but from a population of pre-cells.[8][6][9]/nOtto Kandler was born on 23 October 1920 in Deggendorf, Bavaria, as the 6th child of the family of a market gardener. Growing up and helping in his father's garden, early on, he became interested in plant life and nature in general. \nHe attended school for 8 years. When he was about twelve years old he had read about Charles Darwin and mentioned it to a Catholic priest. The priest punished him with two strikes on his hands with a rod. However he remained interested in the origin and evolution of organisms for the rest of his life.[3]/nHis parents could not afford to pay the fees for the gymnasium, and he was supposed to become a gardener or learn another trade. However his teachers convinced his parents that their talented son should continue school. So he attended the \"Deutsche Aufbauschule\" in Straubing, Bavaria, a school for the education of future teachers. His studies were, however, interrupted by the Second World War. In 1939 he and his fellow students had to join the Reichsarbeitsdienst, later he had to serve in the German army as a radio reporter in Russia. At the end of the war his group was transferred to Austria. He escaped by bicycle to the Western Front to avoid capture by the Russians. After spending a few months in an American prison camp he was allowed to return home. Between 1945 and 1946 he reconstructed his father's market garden and earned some money by growing and selling vegetable, especially cabbage, and flowers to finance his life and his future studies.[1][3][10]/nKandler was very interested in science, but only in 1946 was he able to enrol at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in botany, zoology, geology, chemistry and physics. He also attended philosophy lectures. Since much of the university of Munich had been bombed, the institute buildings were badly damaged and still in ruins. To be admitted, he and all the other students had to remove rubble and help reconstruct buildings. \nAfter three terms he found a research subject for his dissertation in botany. As the first in Germany he started to cultivate isolated plant tissues in vitro. He used these tissue cultures to study for instance metabolism and the influence of auxins under defined in vitro conditions, received his doctor's degree with honors in 1949 and became assistant professor of botany at the University of Munich. After his habilitation in 1953 he remained at the university until 1957.[1][3]\nIn 1953 he married Gertraud Sch\u00e4fer, a graduate student of microbiology. They have three daughters and four grandchildren.\nFor his early publications on photophosphorylation[11][12][13] he received a generous research fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation and, in 1956/1957 he was able to work on basic questions of photosynthesis for one year in the USA.[3][4]/nAfter his return, Kandler was dissatisfied with the poor laboratory conditions at the university at home, so he was glad to find a position as director of the Bacteriological Institute of the South German Dairy Research Center in Freising-Weihenstephan in 1957, where conditions were much better.[3] In 1960 he was appointed full professor of Applied Botany of the Technical University Munich, where research conditions still at that time were bad. So he kept his position in Weihenstephan in parallel until 1965. In 1968 he was appointed full professor and Head of the Department of Botany at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, taught and conducted research until his retirement in 1986.[3][14] His broad scientific interests are indicated by the titles of his more than 400 publications.[3][15]/nKandler would have celebrated his 100th birthday on 23 October 2020. For this centenary Kandler's family gave his chronological collection of historical botany books, among them herbals of the 16th and 17th centuries, as a present to the library of the \"Regensburgische Botanische Gesellschaft\" (founded by David Heinrich Hoppe in 1790), which has been included in the library of the University of Regensburg. Through digitization these historical sources soon will be generally accessible.[16]/nOtto Kandler was very interested in plant growth processes, photosynthesis, metabolism, especially of carbohydrates. \nAs the first in Germany he started to grow isolated plant tissue cultures (e.g. of stems, roots, sprouts, embryos, callus growths) in vitro\nto study metabolism and the effect of auxins under defined in vitro conditions. As mentioned above, this formed the subject of his dissertation (summa cum laude) in 1949.\n[17]/nIn his contribution \u201eHistorical perspectives on queries concerning photophosphorylation\"[18] Kandler describes the beginnings of photophosphorylation research and how he became interested: In 1948, he was inspired by a lecture on the phosphate metabolism of yeast by Feodor Lynen (1964 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine). In these years, in the aftermath of World War II, the original Chemical Institute of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich was still in ruins and Feodor Lynen and his assistant Helmut Holzer were working temporarily as guests in the Botanical Institute just next door to the laboratory where Kandler was engaged in his thesis in botany. Kandler was impressed by the experimental methods in Lynen's laboratory and got acquainted with them; Holzer and Kandler became close friends.[19] At that time, Holzer was able to present the first evidence for ATP formation in yeast oxidizing butanol to butyric acid.[20] Kandler then decided to transfer their techniques for measuring phosphorylation rates in vivo to photosynthesis studies in Chlorella./nSo, in 1950, he was the first to present experimental evidence for the light-dependent formation of ATP (photophosphorylation) in vivo in intact Chlorella cells.[1][4][11][12]\nIn 1954, Daniel I. Arnon discovered photophosphorylation in vitro using isolated chloroplasts[21] and mentioned Kandler's pioneering work.[22] Kandler's early publications on light-dependent formation of ATP[11][12][13] led the Rockefeller Foundation to offer him a one-year research fellowship in the USA. So in 1956\u20131957 he worked for 6 months with Martin Gibbs at the Brookhaven National Laboratory[23] and then for another 6 months with Melvin Calvin (1961 Nobel Prize in Chemistry) at the University of California, Berkeley on central questions of photosynthesis (e.g. the path of carbon in photosynthesis, today called the Calvin-Benson-Bassham Cycle).[4]/nThe method of radioactive labelling, i.e. the use of radioactive isotopes for tracing the path of e.g. carbon in photosynthesis, was brought to Germany by Kandler./nTogether with his coworkers, Kandler demonstrated the occurrence of ADP-glucose, the glucose donor of starch biosynthesis, for the first time in plants. He made an essential contribution to clarify the complicated biosynthesis of branched-chain monosaccharides (hamamelose, apiose). Finally he elucidated the biosynthesis of the sugars of the raffinose family, the most frequent oligosaccharides in plants.[24]\nAs a result of these findings, the function of galactinol, a galactoside of inositol, as a galactosyl donor, was elucidated, and hence the role of inositol as a co-factor of sugar transfer reactions in plants.[1][3][4][25]/nIn addition to his interest in plant physiology and biochemistry Otto Kandler early on focused on bacteria, above all, on the presence or absence of their cell walls, since, in the early 1950s, such wall-less microorganisms were often regarded as representatives of \"urbacteria\".[19] \nTogether with his wife, he investigated the so-called PPLOs, (now mycoplasms), wall-less penicillin-resistant bacteria, and L-form bacteria (bacteria that lost their cell walls). They found that these organisms do not proliferate by binary fission but by a budding process.[26][27]\nThese publications are still cited at present.[28][29][30]/nDuring his time as director of the Bacteriological Institute of the South German Dairy Research Center in Freising-Weihenstephan, Kandler concentrated on dairy microbiology and investigated the physiology, biochemistry and systematics of lactobacilli, on which he wrote a chapter in Bergey's Manual, the \u2018bible' of microbiologists.[1][3]\nIn addition he published numerous papers on the isolation, description and taxonomy of other bacteria.[3][15]/nKandler was one of the first scientists who, together with his group, studied the chemistry and structure of the cell walls of bacteria.[3] The primary structure of peptidoglycan (murein), the unique cell wall component of bacteria, was investigated. Kandler recognized that the amino acid sequence of peptidoglycan is a valuable chemotaxonomic marker. The different peptidoglycan types and their taxonomic implications were described in detail by Schleifer and Kandler.[31] As a result, they suggested comparative cell wall chemistry as a marker for the deep branches in the phylogenetic tree of bacteria.[31] Kandler\u2019s cell wall studies also included methanogenic \"bacteria\" (methanogens) and halophilic \"bacteria\" (halophiles)./nIn October 1976 Kandler discovered that two strains of the methanogen Methanosarcina barkeri did not contain peptidoglycan.[5] \nConsequently, he came to the conclusion that methanogens are basically different from bacteria.\nIn his group, also \"halobacteria\" were found to lack peptidoglycan, confirming the idea, that also these organisms are not bacteria and belong to a group of organisms soon called \"archaebacteria\" (in 1990 classified as archaea[7]).\nIn some \"archaebacteria\" Kandler and K\u00f6nig identified pseudomurein, now also called pseudopeptidoglycan, a novel cell wall component, and elucidated its structure and biosynthesis.[32]/nThe methanogen Methanopyrus kandleri[33]\nwas named in honor of Kandler by Karl O. Stetter as a present for Kandler's 70th birthday.[34]/nTogether with Hans G\u00fcnter Schlegel, Kandler was substantially involved in the foundation of the German collection of microorganisms and cell cultures (DSMZ) in Braunschweig.[3]/nKandler was the founder and editor of Systematic and Applied Microbiology, co-editor of the Archives of Microbiology and of Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Pflanzenphysiologie.[3]/nOtto Kandler's main subject in microbiology was his research on archaea (before 1990 called \"archaebacteria\").\nHis discovery (October 1976) that peptidoglycan (murein), a typical cell wall component of bacteria, is missing in two strains of methanogenic \"bacteria\" (methanogens)[5] became one of the first three pieces of evidence[35] that methanogens belong to a group of organisms distinct from bacteria.\nTherefore, Kandler was delighted when he learned from a letter by Ralph F. Wolfe, expert on methanogens, on 11 November 1976, that Wolfe's colleague Carl Woese (University of Illinois, Urbana, USA) had just discovered basic differences between methanogens and bacteria with his novel 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing method.\nWhen Kandler received this letter, based on his new findings, he had already planned to investigate the cell walls of other methanogens together with Marvin P. Bryant, also an expert on methanogens from the University of Illinois. Coincidentally, Bryant was just sitting in Kandler's office when Wolfe's letter arrived.[3][10]\nIn his letter Wolfe also offered to send cultures for cell wall studies since he knew Kandler was a cell wall expert. Kandler wrote back immediately how impressed he was with Woese's findings and ideas and that he looked forward to investigate Wolfe's methanogens. In his reply Kandler also mentioned that methanogens and halophiles may be \"ancient relics\" that have branched off from the bulk of the prokaryotes before peptidoglycan had been \"invented\". He asked Wolfe to send him lyophilized cells of methanogens to analyse their cell walls.[3][10]/nIn January 1977, Kandler visited Woese for the first time. He was immediately convinced of Woese's new concept, for his cell wall analyses matched perfectly with Woese's 16S rRNA sequencing results.[3][10] \nThis was the beginning of a close and productive transatlantic complementary relationship and cooperation by the exchange of cultures, results and ideas. Kandler's group studied the cell wall composition and Woese's group the 16S rRNA gene sequences.\nIn their fundamental frequently cited publication, Woese and Fox (November 1977)[35]\nintroduced the term \"archaebacteria\", at that time, comprising only methanogens. They cited Kandler[5] and named the very first three pieces of evidence for the concept of the \"archaebacteria\":/nIn this article[35] Woese and Fox also still used a preliminary terminology (\"domains\" for the two groups prokaryotes and eukaryotes; \"primary kingdoms\" or \"urkingdoms\" for the three groupings \"eubacteria\", \"archaebacteria\", and \"urkaryotes\". Only in 1990, in their publication on the phylogenetic tree of life, Woese and Kandler[7] proposed the term \"domain\" for the three groups Bacteria, Archaea, Eucarya, see below)./nWhile Woese's proposal to subdivide organisms into \"three lines of descent\"[35] at that time received little support \u2013 and even harsh criticism\n[36][37]\n\u2013 in the US, Kandler called Woese \"the Darwin of the 20th century\"[3] and was convinced that research on \"archaebacteria\" had a great future./nWith great enthusiasm Kandler founded research on \"archaebacteria\" in Germany[3][10] and organised funding for this novel field.\nIn the spring of 1978, in Munich, Kandler organised the very first meeting on \"archaebacteria\". Carl Woese was invited, but was not able to participate./nIn the summer of 1979, Kandler invited Woese again to give a lecture at a meeting of the \"Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Mikrobiologie und Hygiene\" in Munich. This time Woese participated. He came to Munich for the first time and was welcomed with fanfare, a brass band concert and a dinner party in the great entrance hall of the Botanical Institute of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (photo see \"Life and education\").[3][10]/nThe first international conference ever on \"archaebacteria\" was also organised by Kandler, again in Munich, in 1981. Both, Carl Woese and Ralph Wolfe took part. The resulting conference volume was the very first book on \"archaebacteria\".[38]\nAt this conference convincing evidence for essential structural, biochemical and molecular differences between bacteria and \"archaebacteria\" was presented leading to the gradual acceptance of the concept of the \"archaebacteria\" as an autonomous group of organisms. \nAfter the conference, the \"archaebacteria\" were celebrated by Woese, Wolfe and Kandler on an excursion to the close Alps climbing the top of Hochiss (2299 m) in the Rofan mountains (see Photos)./nIn 1985, Kandler and Zillig organised a second international conference on \"archaebacteria\", again in Munich.[39]/nMeanwhile, the support for the \"archaebacteria\" concept \u2013 and also for the idea of a phylogenetic division into three groups on the basis of 16S rRNA sequencing and additional characteristics \u2013 had grown, but had still not yet been generally accepted by the scientific community. \nAlso an intensive controversial discussion about the level of classification and terminology was taking place (e.g. terms like urkingdom, primary kingdom, empire etc. were considered). This discussion is documented in detail in Sapp (2009, especially chapters 19, 20).[10]/nFinally, after about 13 years of cooperation, in their publication of 1990 (Woese, Kandler, Wheelis),[7] Woese and Kandler proposed a \"tree of life\" consisting of three lines of descent (see adjacent \"Phylogenetic Tree of Life\") for which they introduced the term domain as the highest rank of classification, above the kingdom level. They also suggested the terms Archaea, Bacteria and Eucarya (later corrected to Eukarya) for the three domains and presented the formal description of the taxon Archaea. Up to date, this publication is one of the most frequently cited papers in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.[40] (The role of the third author is described by Sapp (pp.\u00a0261f. and 386)[10] and Quammen (pp.\u00a0210f.)[41])\nIn a second publication,[42]\nthey contrasted their natural system of \"global classification\", a phylogenetic division on the basis of 16S rRNA sequencing, with the conventional division of organisms into two (procaryotes-eucaryotes system) or into five (5-kingdom system) groupings.\nToday the division of the tree of life into three domains \u2013 levels above kingdoms \u2013 is textbook knowledge.[40]/nKandler has always been interested in the early evolution and diversification of life and, finally, presented his pre-cell theory.[8][6][9]/nHe assumed that the early evolution of organisms did not start from a common first ancestral cell, but that each domain evolved by \"multiple cellularization of a multiphenotypical population of pre-cells\",[6] where the invention of cell envelopes played an important role./nA scheme of the pre-cell scenario is presented in the adjacent figure, where essential evolutionary improvements are indicated by numbers:/n\"(1) Reductive formation of organic compounds from CO or CO2 by Me-sulfur coordinative chemistry; (2) tapping of various redox energy sources and formation of primitive enzymes and templates; (3) elements of a transcription and translation apparatus and loose associations; (4) formation of pre-cells; (5) stabilised circular or linear genomes; (6) cytoplasmic membranes; (7) rigid murein cell walls; (8) various non-murein rigid cell walls; (9) glycoproteinaceous cell envelope or glycokalyx; (10) cytoskeleton; (11) complex chromosomes and nuclear membrane; (12) cell organelles via endosymbiosis\".[9]:\u200a22/nKandler's contribution to our understanding of the early evolution of life was valued several times, e.g.\nM\u00fcller 1998,[19]\nWiegel 1998,[43]\nW\u00e4chtersh\u00e4user 2003[44] and 2006,[45]\nSchleifer 2011.[3]/nLouis Pasteur was one of Kandler's scientific heroes.

Interpretation of the trees was complicated by the problem of Long branch attraction (LBA).  By developing new algorithms that were less sensitive to these LBA artefacts, Lake was able to show that the Annelida-Mollusca lineage is the sister group of an arthropod subgroup.[9]  This finding was contrary to the Articulata hypothesis that grouped arthropods with annelids, and was nearly universally endorsed at that time.[10]/nWith the advent of PCR and increased ease of sequencing rDNA in the 1990s, Lake focused on the bilateral animals, and recognised that there were questions over the placement of the lophophorate animals, such as bryozoans, phoronids, and brachiopods.  Lake provided clear DNA-based evidence  indicating that the lophophorates were not deuterostomes as had been widely believed.  In fact, they were most closely related to the mollusc \u2013 annelid clade.  The result of this research was the creation of a new super-phylum, the Lophotrochozoa containing molluscs, annelids, lophophorates, and other animals.[11] Lake recognised that long branch attraction was a severe problem for the mostly rapidly evolving nematodes and was able to provide rDNA sequences from a number of slowly evolving nematodes in order to bypass this difficulty.  This sampling showed that the moulting animals form a clade, called the Ecdysozoa, a second protostomian superphylum sister to the Lophotrochozoa.[12]/nLake also explored concepts concerning the deep phylogenetic origins of the eukaryotic cell.[13] In the eocyte hypothesis, Lake and colleagues proposed that eukaryotes (animals, fungi, plants, and protists) evolved from a specific group of thermophilic prokaryotes, the \"eocyte\" archaebacteria.[14][15][16][17]", "53763336": "Martha Merrow (born 1957) is an American chronobiologist.

Merrow worked with colleagues Till Roenneberg and Anna Wirz-Justice to develop the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire ((MCTQ)), which assesses human chronotypes. Those with early chronotypes may be referred to as \u201clarks\u201d while those with late chronotypes may be referred to as \u201cowls.\u201d[1]/nMerrow's molecular chronobiology lab at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich uses nematodes, yeast, fungi, and human tissue cultures to study the circadian clock in simple systems. Her research focuses on oscillations at the cellular and molecular levels as a representation of organismal rhythms.[2] Merrow's lab often uses techniques such as the insertion of Luciferase gene fusions or Green Fluroescent Protein to visualize oscillations of RNA levels, protein abundance, or protein modifications within the cell. Oscillations in the entrained phase can then be compared to the organism's free running period or the phase produced by other methods of entrainment to elucidate the mechanism of the clock./nWhile she was a professor of Chronobiology at University of Groningen, Merrow led Sub-Project 4: Novel Clock Genes and Principles within EUCLOCK, a European organization of researchers interested in entrainment of circadian clocks.[3] Merrow has served as the secretary and a member for the SRBR and is  currently the vice-president of the European Biological Rhythms Society (EBRS).[4] Merrow coordinated the OnTime consortium, a group consisting of Netherlands-based researchers in the field of chronobiology and is a member of the Program Committee for the upcoming XV EBRS Congress event to be held in Amsterdam.[5] The group attempts to improve health through an understanding of circadian clocks and their entrainment.[6][7] This consortium has its roots in Merrow's organization of the Dutch Clock Club, which is based on the structure of the UK Clock Club.[8] She remains active in academia and has taught at the European Summer School for Chronobiology nearly every year since and including 1996. Additionally, Merrow strives to develop networks for women in science./nSome of Merrow's publications include:[16][17]", "12016908": "Professor Aharon Shulov (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d4\u05e8\u05d5\u05df \u05e9\u05d5\u05dc\u05d5\u05d1, also spelled Schulow, 1907\u20131997) was an Israeli entomologist and the founder of the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo.[1]/nAharon Shulov was born in Yelisavetgrad, Russian Empire, now in Ukraine. He was jailed on charges of Zionist activism. Upon his release in 1926, he immigrated to Palestine. Shulov had been interested in animals from childhood. He became a lecturer in zoology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. After earning a doctorate in Naples, he returned to the Hebrew University. He also spent time in Egypt studying the care of animals in subtropical climates.[2]/nIn 1986, professor Shulov and his colleague Aviv Marx founded the Shulov Institute for Science. The company produces  life-saving products and pain relievers, including a life-saving antiserum to treat yellow scorpion stings which is approved for use by the Israeli Ministry of Health and marketed to hospitals./nIn April 2001, Shulov was posthumously granted a patent, with co-inventor Naphthali Primor, for a non-addictive, topical analgesic derived from snake venom. The patent was assigned to S.I.S. Shulov Institute for Science Ltd./nShulov published several books. The development of eggs of the Red Locust, Nomadacris septemfasciata (Serv.), and the African Migratory Locust, Locusta migratoria migratorioides (R. and F.), and its interruption under particular conditions of humidity[3] was an academic work of entomology. His 1981 The Wolf Shall Dwell with the Lamb: 40 years of the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo tells the story of how the zoo acquired its first lion with the help of Dov Gazit.[4]/nShulov also published articles on esters as insect repellants and attractants.[5] In an entry in Campbell and Lack's 1985 Dictionary of Birds[6] Shulov argued that the Hebrew word translated as \"osprey\" in the King James version of the Bible actually refers to the black vulture, Aegypius monachus./nShulov is best known as the visionary and driving force behind the creation of the Biblical Zoo. He started the zoo in 1940, surprising his neighbours by feeding and keeping such animals as baby tigers in his home on Rabbi Kook Street in central Jerusalem. A year later, in the wake of the neighbors' objections to noise and smell, Shulov relocated to a site just over an acre in size on Shmuel HaNavi Street. The zoo remained there from 1941 until 1947, when land was offered on Mount Scopus. Shulov's objective was to acquire animals mentioned in the Bible.[7] Although many species of the cat family mentioned in the Bible had long disappeared from the region,  Shulov was able to import several big cats, and brought the first lion to the zoo. Professor Shulov served as the director of the zoo for 43 years, until his retirement. The zoo, now known as the Tisch Family Zoological Gardens,[8] has developed into an internationally renowned zoo and research facility, and popular tourist destination.[9]/nThe Prof. Aharon Shulov Fund for the Study of Animals in Captivity,[10] a joint initiative of Shulov's family, the Friends of the Zoo Association and the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo, offers one or more grants each year to support studies relating to the animal collection and conservation activities of the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo. The studies are focused on any of the Zoo's fields of interest: animal welfare and husbandry, animal reintroduction, reproduction of endangered species, conservation genetics, exotic animal nutrition and medical care, and more. Researchers from academic and non-academic institutions and university students (with preference given to Hebrew University students) are entitled to submit their research proposals to the Fund./nAfter a campaign by Shulov's family, supported by Ehud Olmert (then mayor of Jerusalem), a main road in the Malha neighborhood, leading to the entrance of the Zoo, was named Aharon Shulov Road.", "63692046": "Rebecca M. Calisi Rodriguez is an American neuroendocrinologist, wildlife biologist, and National Geographic Explorer. She is an Associate professor of Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior in the College of Biological Sciences at the University of California, Davis. Calisi leads a research team that studies how the brain controls sexual behavior, reproduction, and parental care, and how this changes under stress. As the Director for Science Communications at UC Davis, Calisi also studies science communication and advocates for inclusivity, equity, and diversity in STEM./nCalisi was born in Dallas, Texas, on September 13, 1979, to Mexican-American mother, Dolores Rebecca (n\u00e9e Rodr\u00edguez), and Italian-American father, Anthony Paul Calisi. When not in school, she spent a lot of her time on her maternal grandparents cattle ranch near the Texas-Mexico border.[1] Constantly being surrounded by animals developed her passion for animal behavior from a young age, but she also had a talent for fine arts.[1] Calisi attended Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York, where she studied studio art and theater. Some of her theater classmates included Lake Bell and Jon Bernthal. Calisi later moved to Massachusetts where she attended Boston College, majoring in cultural psychology and minoring in studio art.[2]/nAfter completing her Bachelors of Arts in 2001, Calisi returned to Texas and was hired by the Dallas Independent School District as an Elementary School Teacher and an English as a Second Language Instructor for kindergarten through the 4th grade.[2] Calisi stayed in this role for one year before being recruited by the Dallas Zoo and Aquarium in 2002 to teach and develop curricula for grades K-12.[2] While at the Dallas Zoo, Calisi was commissioned to paint a mural for the Dallas Zoo's education center.[1] During this time, Calisi spent many hours volunteering on various animal conservation projects. The biologists she worked with noted that she had a talent for research and encouraged her to pursue a graduate degree in the science. She earned a Masters in Biology at the University of Texas, Arlington.[3] Her research project involved studying the mating habits and coloration of a species of spiny lizard called Sceloporus pyrocephalus in which the females are brightly colored and aggressive.[1] Calisi uncovered what hormones were driving changes in female coloration and aggression.[1] Calisi completed her Masters in 2006.[3] This work was seen as very progressive, in that most studies of aggression and coloration in any animal had focused on males./nDuring her Masters, Calisi published several first-author papers exploring the physiology of the female Mexican boulder spiny lizard (Sceloporus pyrocephalus). A striking observation is that the female lizards have much brighter and more intense coloration than the males.[4] Calisi sought to understand the endocrine mechanisms regulating coloration and found that higher cortisol levels were associated with less outstanding coloration and higher testosterone and estradiol were associated with more conspicuous coloration.[4] Calisi reported these findings in her Masters thesis titled \u201cProximate And Ultimate Mechanisms Associated With Female Secondary Coloration In The Mexican Boulder Spiny Lizard, (Sceloporus pyrocephalus)\u201d and proposed that color is an honesty signal of reproductive status in females and that these findings should modify our concept of sexual selection to be more inclusive to female coloration and behavior.[5]/nStill unsure what type of career she was looking for, Calisi decided to pursue graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley within the Department of Integrative Biology.[3] Calisi was still driven to understand the biological underpinning of parental care behavior, and felt that the best possible organism to study this in was birds so Calisi joined the lab of Dr. George Bently.[6] Under Bently's mentorship, Calisi first explored how stress modulates the reproductive axis via interactions with the hypothalamic gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) system.[7] Since GnIH is known to down-regulate sexual behavior in birds, this was an important aspect of the reproductive system to probe due to its regulatory function.[7] They found that stress, specifically in the spring, leads to increased activity of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) as well as increased expression of GnIH cells suggesting that the impact of stress on the PVN and the GnIH system is dependent on the phase of the reproductive cycle.[7] For her thesis work, Calisi showed the effects of both stress and the social environment on GnIH and she found that stress hormone receptors are expressed on GnIH cells which highlights a direct mechanism by which stress can regulate reproductive behavior in birds.[8]/nAfter finishing her graduate studies in 2010, Calisi conducted postdoctoral studies under the mentorship of Dr. John Wingfield, at UC Davis and Dr. Timothy Q. Gentner at UC San Diego.[2] Calisi studied how hormonal fluctuations in adulthood affect learning.[2] Calisi and her colleagues found that circulating estradiol (E2) levels in combination with changes in the photoperiod affect learning in different ways.[9] Birds given high doses of E2 exhibited better accuracy in auditory tasks when photostimulated but worse accuracy when photosensitive.[9] Funded by the National Science Foundation and well as the University of California President's Postdoctoral Fellowship, Calisi continued to explore how neuroendocrine and molecular factors influence reproductive and sexual behaviors in birds as a postdoctoral researcher under the mentorship of Dr. Erica Bree Rosenblum and Dr. Lance Kriegsfeld from 2013 until 2014.[2]/nCalisi was recruited to Barnard College at Columbia University for her first faculty position as an Assistant Professor of Biology in 2014.[2] Her lab focused on exploring how physical, chemical, and social environments affect health and reproduction of organisms at a neurobiological level.[10]/nCalisi was quickly recruited back to the West Coast in 2015 by the University of California, Davis where she took on multiple faculty titles.[3] Calisi became an Associate Professor of Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior at the College of Biological Sciences, as well as a faculty in the Center for the Advancement of Multicultural Perspectives on Science, and a faculty in the Environmental Health Sciences Center.[3] Calisi's lab still focuses on understanding the biological mechanisms underlying reproductive and parental care behavior through the lens of neurogenomics.[11] Her lab explores the genetic changes that occur in the brain that underlie parental behaviors and they further look at how insults to the stress system affect genomic activity in brain regions implicated in reproduction.[11]/nShortly after setting up her lab, Calisi published innovative findings from work she conducted while at Barnard.[12] Since her lab focuses on birds as a model organism, specifically pigeons, Calisi and her colleagues found that feral pigeons could provide an honest indicator of lead in NYC, that blood lead levels were highest in the summer and that pigeon blood lead levels were mirrored in children in those neighbourhoods.[13] Since pigeons could provide a potent indicator of other environmental pollutants, Calisi has been supported by UC Davis to extend her research to look for evidence of other environmental toxins in pigeons that mirror neighbourhood level toxin load.[14]/nCalisi's group also focuses on exploring sexually dimorphic gene expression throughout the tissues of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal (HPG) axis.[15] Their thorough analysis showed that sex-differences are evident along this axis, such as differences in androgen receptor, prolactin, and arginine vasopressin receptor 1A that highlight the critical need to for sex parity in further research on reproductive function and health.[15] This work provided a critical baseline for Calisi's next question regarding the effectcs of stress on the HPG axis. Calisi and her group looked at the transcriptomic differences across male and female rock doves in response to restraint stress.[16] They found that female rock doves exhibited increased responses to stress at all levels of the HPG axis compared to males and these many of the changes were in genes that are uniquely responsive in females.[16]/nCalisi's focus on understanding how exposure to environmental pollutants affects endocrine function has taken her into a new realm of model organism, the western mosquito fish.[17] In study in 2019, Calisi explored how pesticides impact gene expression and reproductive behavior in fish.[17] They found that, despite no observable behavioral changes, they detected increased estrogen receptor and glucocorticoid receptor in brain tissue suggesting that nonlethal concentrations of pollutants have long lasting effects on the nervous system.[17]/nCalisi is a fervent advocate for equity in STEM and works to affect tangible change in her scientific community specifically to improve the lives of mothers in STEM.[18] After having her first child, Calisi became aware of the lack of support for mothers in science in terms of lack of spaces for lactation at work and conference settings, lack of child-care at conferences, and a lack of an open culture that supports mothers in STEM from early on in the pipeline.[18] Calisi has written multiple articles and given many seminars and lectures on the topic of supporting women, mothers, and underrepresented minorities in STEM.[19] After one particular conference, Calisi noticed the lack of suitable lactation rooms and she organized a working group of 45 mothers in science to speak up about the issue and request basic needs to support mothers when they are at conferences, necessary components of the career trajectory in academia.[19] She, along with the working group, wrote an article that was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences discussing the issues mothers face at conferences and how to solve them in a simple, cheap manner.[20] Her writing has been featured in the Scientific American as well where she discusses the \u201cpublish or perish\u201d culture of academia not being compatible with supporting a family, and that the majority of this burden is placed on mothers making it even harder for women to stay competitive in academia beside their male peers.[21]/nIn Calisi's work with the Center for the Advancement of Multicultural Perspectives on Science (CAMPOS), she has been further focusing on making sure that a culture of inclusivity extends to typically underrepresented background in STEM.[18] Using her creativity from a background in art, she just finished a video series highlighting Latina women scientists, of which she is one, to show young Latina students that they can be successful scientists, too.[19]/nAlongside these efforts, Calisi is focusing a component of her lab on Science Communication in order to insure that everyone has access to reputable and understandable information about scientific discoveries.[22] Making science accessible is a first step towards making the scientific community inclusive and equity, Calisi says.[22] Noted for her efforts in this area, Calisi was recently honored with the role of Science Communications Creative Strategist for the NIH Director's Office Data Commons Project.[23]", "67722512": "Anne Kemp is an Australian ichthyologist and paleoichthyologist who specializes in lungfishes (order Dipnoi).

Clay crystals, as other crystals, preserve their external formal arrangement as they grow, snap,[clarification needed] and grow further. Clay crystal masses of a particular external form may happen to affect their environment in ways that affect their chances of further replication. For example, a \"stickier\" clay crystal is more likely to silt a stream bed, creating an environment conducive to further sedimentation. It is conceivable that such effects could extend to the creation of flat areas likely to be exposed to air, dry, and turn to wind-borne dust, which could fall randomly in other streams. Thus\u2014by simple, inorganic, physical processes\u2014a selection environment might exist for the reproduction of clay crystals of the \"stickier\" shape.[5]/nThere follows a process of natural selection for clay crystals that trap certain forms of molecules to their surfaces that may enhance their replication potential.

His father, officially known as Leon Sanilevici, was a trader, and his mother, Rebeca, a housewife.[1] Both branches descended from prominent Jewish community leaders\u2014Leon's father was a Rabbi of Craiova Jews, in southern Romania, while Rebeca was the daughter of Boto\u015fani's own Rabbi\u2014whose ancestors had settled in the Danubian Principalities to escape pogroms in the Russian Empire.[1] Almost all of Leon's other children grew up to become distinguished artists and intellectuals: Simion, Jacques and Maximilian were mathematicians; Solomon a painter; Iosif an economist; Emil a zoologist.[2]/nThe family, whom literary historian George C\u0103linescu describes as \"utterly assimilated\" into Romanian culture,[1] was not in fact emancipated: like most Romanian Jews of that era, Sanielevici was not granted citizenship at birth.[3] Although a self-declared atheist,[4][5] Sanielevici later recommended the voluntary mass baptism of Jews.[1] He grew up in a cosmopolitan neighborhood, alongside Romanians and Armenians;[6] the unfamiliar suffix -ici, chosen by Henric's ancestors, misled some into believing that the family was of Serb origin.[7]/nHenric spent most of his childhood between Boto\u015fani and various rural localities in Moldavia, among them Coste\u015fti, Dolhasca and Podriga.[8] The countryside, he was to recall in writing, shaped his vision of human nutrition as the source of physical and cultural differences: \"Everywhere there were orchards, one to every homestead, and often with select fruit. [...] Fruit was falling on the ground in piles, without anyone even bothering to turn it into cider, at least. Countryside attics were full of huge piles, white and greenish, of peaches the size of apples [...]. Until fifteen years of age, I can only recall images of myself eating fruit all day long\".[9] The setting also inspired his naturalistic observations on poultry (he described Moldavian hens as particularly slender and prone to wade in still water), on wild birds, and even on spiders.[1]/nWhile he was still a student in Boto\u015fani, the young man made his debut in the socialist press, founding and editing his own newspaper, the short-lived Proletarul.[10] He graduated high school in his home town, and took a degree in Letters and Philosophy at the University of Bucharest.[1]/nTogether with Simion, who was Technical University student, he attended the Marxist society of Bucharest's Sotir Hall, led by Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, and joined the militant Romanian Social-Democratic Workers' Party (PSDMR).[11] Especially after the PSDMR's creation, Henric gave weekly public lectures for the workers at Sotir, where he was known under the pseudonym Hasan.[12] The two brothers were contributors to Adev\u0103rul, at the time a socialist daily edited by Gherea's pupil Constantin Mille, and, around 1896, were also writing for its short-lived literary supplements.[13] Henric's articles were also published in other socialist and center-left papers: Lumea Nou\u0103, Munca, Av\u00e2ntul, and the Pite\u015fti literary magazine Povestea Vorbei.[10]/nA main focus of Sanielevici's early work as a critic was defending Dobrogeanu-Gherea's Marxist literary theory against Junimea, the conservative literary society. Late in the 20th century, cultural historian Z. Ornea described how Sanielevici, Garabet Ibr\u0103ileanu, Traian Demetrescu, Anton Bacalba\u015fa, Emil Fagure and other \"young socialists\" took up the combat when Gherea remained silent, and responded with an \"offensive\" to the Junimist jibes.[14] The leading Junimist theorist and cultural critic, Titu Maiorescu, issued formal retorts, responding to specific points made by Sanielevici.[15] Nevertheless, the \"young socialist\" militant also published articles in the Junimea magazine, Convorbiri Literare.[10] Additionally, he was a leading contributor to, and for a while editorial secretary of,[16] the eclectic journal Noua Revist\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103, run by the ex-Junimist philosopher Constantin R\u0103dulescu-Motru. It was there that he began a series of articles in defense of didacticism, with which he established his reputation as a cultural journalist.[17] Noua Revist\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103 was also the place where, some years later, Sanielevici met and befriended fellow journalist Constantin Beldie.[18]/nIn 1901, Sanielevici was in the German Empire, for an academic specialization in the field of Anthropology at the University of Berlin.[19] In 1904, he was in Paris, France, where he spoke at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anthropologique. The topic of his dissertation challenged contemporary assumptions on physical anthropology, primarily the theories of Swedish physician Anton Nystr\u00f6m. Sanielevici spoke out against Nystr\u00f6m's belief that \"dolichocephalic\" people were abnormal. Arguing that Nystr\u00f6m stood against \"all anthropological data\",[20] the Romanian suggested that the shape of one's skull was determined by mastication. The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 as a whole found his interpretation strange and unappealing.[19] An influential racial theorist, Joseph Deniker, also rejected the idea, and noted in particular Sanielevici's \"strange and false\" argument that the only naturally \"brachycephalic\" skulls were \"Mongoloid\".[21]/nBack home, Sanielevici found steady employment was as a schoolteacher, and he successively taught French to high school students in Gala\u021bi, Ploie\u0219ti, T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te and Bucharest.[1] He also expanded on his activity in criticism, with the debut volumes Studii critice (\"Critical Studies\", Cartea Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 publishers, 1902)[22] and \u00cencerc\u0103ri critice (\"Critical Essays\", 1903).[23] His focus was on questioning the established criteria of literary criticism. In particular, Sanielevici focused on the poem Miori\u0163a, already recognized as a staple of Romanian folklore, and made sarcastic comments about its subject matter.[24] Together with W. Majerczik, he published a German-language translation of the novella S\u0103rmanul Dionis (\"Poor Dionysus\"), by Romania's national poet, Mihai Eminescu. It saw print with the Bukarester Tagblatt company, in 1904.[25]/nWhile in Gala\u0163i, Sanielevici made his name as the founder and editor of Curentul Nou, a literary review which appeared from 1905 to 1906. As the PSDMR split into competing factions (1899), he and Garabet Ibr\u0103ileanu made some efforts to regroup the scattered socialist clubs around new ideals, with an emphasis on uplifting the peasantry\u2014an ideology that came to be known as \"Poporanism\".[26] Ibr\u0103ileanu was based in the larger city of Ia\u015fi, but Sanielevici found Gala\u0163i more suitable a location for the Poporanist projects. In his view, Ia\u015fi was home to a decaying Moldavian nobility, state-dependent and nationalistic, while his adoptive home was a \"citadel of true democracy\".[27] In his letters to Ibr\u0103ileanu, whereby he invited him and Poporanist theorist Constantin Stere to contribute, Sanielevici acknowledged that his journal was not afraid of radicalism: \"I have grown tired of hypocrisy\".[28]/nWith the Curentul Nou project, Sanielevici concentrated his polemical stance on the right-wing, agrarian and conservative publications of the day, and primarily ridiculed the work of writers at S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul magazine. He candidly informed Ibr\u0103ileanu: \"We have a grand work to accomplish, a work that will resonate throughout Romanian literary history, the work of bringing down a shameful current that has been clutching the country for these last 5 years\".[4] However, Sanielevici was also a sporadic contributor to the Neamul Rom\u00e2nesc review, which was founded by historian Nicolae Iorga as the new version of S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul.[10]/nIn time, Curentul Nou identified itself with a new form of traditionalist, peasant-oriented, literature, as advocated by the formerly socialist \"Poporanists\". As noted by literary theorist Eugen Lovinescu, the Gala\u0163i paper was a direct predecessor of the leading Poporanist monthly Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103, founded at Ia\u015fi in 1906.[29] Ibr\u0103ileanu approached both Sanielevici and Dobrogeanu-Gherea with offers to head the editorial staff, but both, in turn, refused his invitation.[30] At the time, the other Poporanists were beginning to protest against the Curentul Nou branch: publicist Spiridon Popescu, who was Ibr\u0103ileanu's companion, threatened to quit if the \"insane\" Sanielevici and \"the Jewish critic\" Gherea were ever on board.[31] Sanielevici only began contributing there in 1908, and, in 1909, was made the editorial secretary.[32] He was still mainly active in Gala\u0163i, where, in early 1909, he joined a fundraising drive to complete a statue of Eminescu.[33]/nIn his Curentul Nou period, Sanielevici focused his attention on the young novelist Mihail Sadoveanu, whose work he considered the main manifestation of S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torism. To his critic's dismissive remarks, Sadoveanu replied with a violent article in the political gazette Voin\u0163a Na\u0163ional\u0103: \"I promise you a stern comeback, and do let me know if there is any clean spot on your body that may yet receive it.\"[34] The first fissures between Sanielevici and his Poporanist colleagues began to show at roughly the same time. Emerging as one of the Poporanist ideologues around 1905, Ibr\u0103ileanu defended Sadoveanu against Sanielevici's observations.[6][34][35][36][37] This stance probably helped Sadoveanu to make up his mind about leaving the S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torists and joining the Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 group,[38] while the controversy only increased his exposure.[34]/nInitially, Ibr\u0103ileanu attempted to mediate between the two rivals, advising moderation: Sadoveanu wrote to him to explain that \"every bit of my soul\" had been wounded, while Sanielevici announced that he was ready to defend himself with a revolver, should the \"bandit\" novelist come after him.[34] Probably as a direct consequence of Sadoveanu's arrival at Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103, Sanielevici was sacked from his position on the editorial staff (September 1909).[39] Reportedly, the young critic did not take the matter to heart, and continued to treat Ibr\u0103ileanu with a mix of friendliness and superiority.[6] They were still united by their disdain toward the ex-Poporanist columnist Ilarie Chendi. In 1910, one of Chendi's antisemitic comments in the journal Cump\u0103na, directed specifically at Sanielevici, sparked an anti-Chendi campaign in the Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 pages.[40]/nAfter a complicated process which involved a vote in Parliament, Henric Sanieleveci received his naturalization in November 1910.[41] In 1911, he made his return to Germany, where he attended additional lectures in Anthropology the G\u00f6ttingen University and researched the Sammlung f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerkunde collections.[42] He lectured in front of the G\u00f6ttingen Anthropological Society, where he first aired his assumption that the \"Nordic race\" traced its origin to Pleistocene-era fishermen, and enlisted negative or ironic responses from his peers.[19] In the hope of touching a more sympathetic audience, Sanielevici published the results of his research in the Anatomischer Anzeiger.[19]/nUpon his return to Romania, despite having earned his citizenship, Sanielevici found that he could not enter the newly created Romanian Writers' Society, which had a strictly nativist agenda.[43] The period however brought success to the other Sanielevici brothers: Simion took over the Chair of Mathematics at Bucharest University;[44] Maximilian, turning to medical sociology, pioneered social epidemiology in Moldavia,[45] and was later administrator of the insurance company Generala.[46] Solomon, who was even employed as an illustrator by the Writers' Society,[47] became a noted presence within the Bucharest Impressionist circle.[48]/nSanielevici was still an active Poporanist by the time of World War I. During Romania's neutrality period (1914\u20131916), he concentrated on his literary work and, in 1916, published the biographical essay volume Icoane fugare (\"Passing Icons\", second edition 1921), as well as a new work of literary criticism: Cercet\u0103ri critice \u015fi filosofice (\"Critical and Philosophical Studies\").[49] Among these individual studies, one returned to S\u0103rmanul Dionis, tracing the links between Eminescu (otherwise a textbook Junimist) and the international Romanticism of ca. 1820.[4][50] Sanielevici himself considered the piece to be his best work, and one of the best essays ever written.[4] The period witnessed the first instance of Sanielevici's recurrent publicity stunt: from then on, all copies of his books came with his autographs.[4]/nAccording to historian Lucian Boia, the literary critic did not follow his Poporanist colleagues in political debates: while they remained firmly on the \"Germanophile\" side, which advocated an alliance with the Central Powers, Sanielevici was \"more interested in his own projects than in the course of events.\"[51] He was still courted by the most radical wing of the Germanophiles, represented by Tudor Arghezi of the newspaper Cronica.[52] Eventually, in summer 1916, the Bucharest protocol sealed Romania's alliance with the Entente Powers, but the resulting defeats brought the occupation of southern Romania by the Central Powers. The military clashes impacted on the Sanielevici family: Solomon was killed in combat with the intruding armies.[47]/nHenric himself was one of the hostages taken by the German Army after the taking of Bucharest. According to a fellow captive, he was one of several Jews on a multi-ethnic prisoners' convoy, deported to Bulgaria under armed guard.[53] Together with other schoolteachers and academics (R\u0103dulescu-Motru, Dumitru Tilic\u0103 Burileanu, Gheorghe Oprescu), he was kept in Bulgarian concentration camps, at either Troyan or Etropole.[54] He spent a full year in captivity.[55] A rumor circulated by his nationalist adversaries had it that Sanielevici irritated the occupiers with his critique of German interests in Romania. According to this account, he tried to justify himself to his captors by noting that \"only in this [patriotic] way could he create himself a basis for his criticism among the Romanian people.\"[56] Sanielevici's posthumous biographer, Adrian Jicu, notes the opposite: \"Although it may seem hard to believe, on many occasions Sanielevici proved himself more of a patriot than his Romanian national contemporaries.\"[57]/nThe accusations, publicized by the antisemitic journal Weltkampf (of the Militant League for German Culture), quoted from an anonymous author. According to them, the \"cheeky\" Sanielevici, known as V. Podriga, had authored articles against Germany, before taking up assignments as a German agent of influence and proceeding to denounce his literary friends.[58] The same source acknowledged that Sanielevici was imprisoned by the occupiers, but attributed this to his \"Jewish pride\": according to his accusers, the Poporanist critic gave himself away when passages from the Podriga articles made it into his Germanophile pieces.[58]/nOnce released from captivity, Sanielevici returned to occupied Bucharest, and, exposing himself to accusations of collaborationism, began his contribution to Lumina, a newspaper put out by Germanophile-Poporanist Constantin Stere.[59] His articles there, Boia notes, were apolitical, but his correspondence of the time showed that he leaned toward the Germanophile camp.[60] This change occurred in mid 1918, after Romania agreed to a separate peace with the enemy, when he resumed contacts with the Poporanists who had fled to Moldavia. In October 1918, believing that the turn of events had confirmed the Germanophiles' justness, and their leadership position in Romanian culture, Sanielevici began working on a literary supplement for Stere's newspaper.[60]/nThe late switch in allegiance was, according to Boia, a \"strange thing\": Sanielevici entertained such prospects precisely as German capitulation was occurring worldwide, and Romania was marking its return into the Entente camp.[60] For this reason, Boia includes Sanielevici among a group of Romanian intellectuals who seemed \"confused by the war\", changing sides at the most inauspicious moments.[61]/nIn 1920s Greater Romania, Henric Sanielevici continued to publish works of literature and social science. In 1920, Bucharest's Editura Socec issued his Noi studii critice (\"New Critical Studies\") and Probleme sociale \u015fi psihologice (\"Social and Psychological Issues\").[62] In 1919, Sanielevici had turned against his socialist roots. As he wrote, \"the West is not heading into socialism, but into a state of equilibrium between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat\".[63]/nA year later, he announced his break with Poporanism, relaunching Curentul Nou with a distinct cultural platform. Financially supported by Sanielevici, the new edition counted among its contributors the woman writer Constan\u0163a Marino-Moscu and the philologist Giorge Pascu.[64] Sanielevici himself was contributing to Lumea Evree, the Jewish Romanian community bimonthly, put out in Bucharest by philosopher Iosif Bruc\u0103r.[65]/n1921 deepened Sanielevici's conflict with the Poporanists, after he published at Socec the volume Poporanismul reac\u0163ionar (\"Reactionary Poporanism\").[34][57][66][67] For Sanielevici, Poporanism and its Peasants' Party successors were glorifying in the peasantry a \"viscous\" class, and believed that lower-class frustrations needed to be kept in check by the adoption of \"limited absolutism\".[63]/nEarly in the 1920s, Sanielevici returned as a contributor to Adev\u0103rul, while also printing his articles in its sister newspapers\u2014Diminea\u0163a, Adev\u0103rul Literar \u015fi Artistic. He was for a while an editor for the latter gazette.[68] Sanielevici also contributed to the Adev\u0103rul publishing company, translating, from the Spanish, Vicente Blasco Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez's Vuelta del mundo de un novelista (as C\u0103l\u0103toria unui romancier \u00een jurul lumii).[69] In 1924, the Adev\u0103rul group also published Sanielevici's new book of criticism, which, in its title, introduced his reference to \"proletarian classicism\" (Clasicismul proletariatului).[70] Sanielevici's term referred to self-exiled Romanian writer Panait Istrati, whose socialist-themed novels enjoyed breakthrough success in Western Europe.[71]/nThe Sanielevicis were heavily involved in supporting the newly emancipated Jewish community of Greater Romania. Iosif Sanielevici was a Jewish member of the Romanian Senate in the 1922 legislature, and noted for his interventions in legislating medical practice.[72] In 1926, Adev\u0103rul Literar \u015fi Artistic published Henric Sanielevici's inquiry into the Jewish origins of Vasile Alecsandri, the celebrated founder of 19th-century Moldavian Romanticism.[73] A significant part of Sanielevici's press contributions was dedicated to uncovering the Jewish roots of some eminently Romanian authors: he claimed that all people by the name of Botez (literally, \"baptism\"), including poet Demostene Botez, were converted Jews.[74]/nSanielevici's other works included the Alte cercet\u0103ri critice \u015fi filosofice (\"Some More Critical and Philosophical Studies\", Cartea Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103, 1925) and Probleme politice, literare \u015fi sociale (\"Political, Literary and Social Issues\", Ancora publishers, ca. 1925).[75] In 1926, he also printed his French-language work of paleoanthropology: La Vie des mammif\u00e8res et des hommes fossiles d\u00e9chiffr\u00e9e \u00e0 l'aide de l'anatomie (\"The Life of Mammals and Fossilized Humans Deciphered Using Anatomy\"). The next year, he returned with a work on comparative racialism, Noi probleme literare, politice, sociale (\"New Literary, Political, Social Issues\").[76]/nWith his Adev\u0103rul articles, Sanielevici continued to participate in the debates animating Romanian society. In March 1929, he wrote with skepticism about the Romanian prohibition lobby, but proposed the introduction of pasteurized grape juice in lieu of Romanian wine.[77] In 1930, Adev\u0103rul company published two other titles: Literatur\u0103 \u015fi \u015ftiin\u0163\u0103 (\"Literature and Science\"), followed in 1935 by the anti-fascist tracts of \u00cen slujba Satanei?!... (\"In Service to Satan?!...\", 2 vols.).[78] Alte orizonturi (\"Other Horizons\") was another Adev\u0103rul-published work by Sanielevici; it does not carry a date, but was presumably published in or around 1930.[75] In 1932, he reviewed the literary contributions of Junimist academic Ion Petrovici,[79] who had been a sympathetic ear for Sanielevici's theories on race.[80] Also undated are the books Sanielevici issued as part of the Diminea\u0163a book collection: La Montmorency (\"In Montmorency\", No. 15 of the series), \u00cen tren (\"On the Train\", No. 40), Familia Lowton (\"The Lowton Family\"), Civiliza\u0163ia (\"Civilization\").[75]/nDuring the early 1930s, Sanielevici repeatedly tried to receive a university-level appointment. He unsuccessfully ran against the Poporanist Paul Bujor for the Natural Science Chair at the University of Ia\u015fi,[80] where his brother Simion was (since 1920) Lecturer of Mechanics and Geometry.[44] Frustrated in his ambition, and still obliged to make his living as a professor of French, Sanielevici began working on a pro domo, borrowing its title from S\u0103rmanul Dionis.[4] Deploring the general state of affairs, the author complained that his tracts, although widely circulated among students, were not enough to earn him an academic promotion, and that he and his family were \"starving\" (Sanielevici also boasted that his books had sold over 35,000 copies in 15 years).[4]/nSome of Sanielevici's later scholarly work evidenced a focus on ethnography, religious studies and folkloristics. As he himself noted, these themes preoccupied him during his work for Adev\u0103rul. The articles, collected in Literatur\u0103 \u0219i \u0219tiin\u021b\u0103 volume, discussed Romanian ethnography back to the ancient tribes of Dacia: Arta \u021b\u0103ranului rom\u00een este curat mediteranian\u0103 (\"The Art of the Romanian Peasant Is Plainly Mediterranean\"), Rasa, limba \u0219i cultura b\u0103\u0219tina\u0219ilor Daciei (\"The Race, Language and Culture of Dacia's Aboriginals\"), Str\u0103mo\u0219ul nostru aurignacianul (\"Our Ancestor, the Aurignacian Man\").[81]/nIn December 1930, Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 published his lengthy essay linking the Dacians, modern Romanian food culture and the ecstatic rituals of 20th century sects in Bessarabia.[82] With an article in Adev\u0103rul Literar \u015fi Artistic, he discussed the supposed links between the poem Miori\u0163a and the legendary Dacian prophet Zalmoxis (Miori\u0163a sau patimile lui Zalmoxis, that is \"Miori\u0163a or the Passion of Zalmoxis\").[83][84][85] These ideas were expanded upon in another 1930 volume, Literatur\u0103 \u015fi \u015ftiin\u0163\u0103 (\"Literature and Science\").[76] The topic of race continued to preoccupy him and, in 1937, produced the volume Les g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrices, les origines et la classification des races humaines (\"The Generators, Origins and Classification of Human Races\", published with \u00c9mile Nourry's company in Paris).[86]/nHenric Sanielevici survived World War II, but was exposed to menacing scrutiny by the successive antisemitic and fascist regimes (see Romania in World War II). As early as July 1940, the literary supplement of Universul daily nominated Sanielevici, Dobrogeanu-Gherea and many other Jewish authors as ones \"who could never have contributed to our people's spiritual unity\", calling for a boycott on their work.[87] At a time when many Jewish authors were officially banned, George C\u0103linescu published his main work of literary history, which, despite reviewing Sanielevici with much irony,[68] did not obey the order to obliterate Jewish contributions.[88] The fascist press retorted with aggressive comments, some of which depicted C\u0103linescu as a secret admirer of Sanielevici's.[89]/nHowever, the Ion Antonescu regime was lenient on Sanielevici. In 1943, he was included in a special category of Jews who received, by dispensation, a re-naturalization as Romanians.[90] Henric's brother, Simion, and his nephew, Alexandru, were sacked from academia, but managed to find parallel employment at the unofficial Jewish College.[91]/nThe end of Antonescu's rule brought a relaxation of antisemitic measures, but, during the build-up to a Romanian communist regime, Sanielevici was again disenfranchised. Shortly after the anti-Nazi coup of August 1944, he was welcomed into the reformed Romanian Writers' Society.[92] Before his 1951 death, scrutiny of his work came from the part of communist censors, who included Poporanismul reac\u0163ionar on a list of banned writings.[93] The document's stated agenda was the purge of \"fascist\" or \"Nazi\" literature\u2014Sanielevici's inclusion therein, critic Al. S\u0103ndulescu notes, showed the ulterior and \"aberrant\" purpose of the list.[93]/nWith his debut in professional criticism, Henric Sanielevici was the proponent of essentially Marxist concepts, as adapted to Romanian life by philosopher Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea. According to Sanielevici's rival C\u0103linescu, the \u00cencerc\u0103ri critice author always remained committed to Gherea's dialectical materialism and \"excessively ethical\" Marxist humanism, which had shaped the Romanian socialists' didactic literature even before his time.[8] Another scholar of the period, Tudor Vianu, writes that Sanielevici started out as the main \"continuator\" of Dobrogeanu-Gherea's ideas on culture.[94] At Curentul Nou, the young critic followed the \"Gherist\" line, to which time added the influence of other historicist or deterministic thinkers, primarily direct borrowings from Hippolyte Taine.[95]/nThe impact and relevance of such ideas were investigated by several other academics. Adrian Jicu argues that the main influences on the Romanian author were Georg Brandes, Karl Kautsky, Gustave Lanson and \u00c9mile Hennequin, in addition to Dobrogeanu-Gherea and Taine.[19] Another author, Leonida Maniu, argues that, early on, Sanielevici was a social determinist wholly under Gherea's spell, including when it came to the \"rigor and elementariness\" of his deductions.[57] Similarly, critic Doris Mironescu sees Sanielevici's theories as having \"deep roots in Gherea's socialism\" and a foreign model in Taine's historicism, with only vague personal additions.[68] According to Sanielevici's own account, what had been \"idolatrous love\" turned into \"hatred and contempt\" toward Gherea, and then toward historical materialism.[96]/nSanielevici's public profile and eccentricity created irritation and even scandal in his day, as summarized by writer and scholar Antonio Patra\u015f: \"[he was remembered as] an eccentric figure, a lampoonist with diverse preoccupations [...], sometimes perceived as an intelligent and cultured critic, but overall an autodidact with the exorbitant pretensions of an uomo universale and the insufferable airs of a decadent cleric, with a holier-than-thou attitude.\"[97] While describing himself as the leading cultural factor of the nation, \"one of the greatest creators ever produced by mankind\", Sanielevici noted that he was struggling against \"lightning and hailstorm\" launched by his envious peers.[4] Moreover, he claimed, \"there almost isn't one publicist, literato, politician\" to have refrained from plagiarizing his ideas.[4]/nIn his profile of Sanielevici, Eugen Lovinescu mentions a \"lampoonist's deformation and stylistic violence\", \"lucidity in expression\" and many other talents, as well as a \"noble\", but misguided and distorted, passion for turning \"crude material\" into science.[98] He adds: \"H. Sanielevici's style, much like his entire personality, suffers from a twofold shift in balance: firstly in the verbal violence and then in the morbid self-awareness.\"[99] In his own retrospective work, C\u0103linescu also proposed that Sanielevici was an essayist more than an actual critic, praising his texts as evidences of \"great literary skill\" (\"gracious\" works, with charmingly \"voluptuous poetry\", but also \"bizarre\" in content).[9] He remarked that, while Sanielevici could prove himself \"a talented polemicist\", the assessments he made displayed such \"enormity\" as to become \"inoffensive\".[1] Similarly, Z. Ornea discusses Sanielevici and his traditionalist rival Ilarie Chendi as \"tested polemicists\", \"excellent at organizing and mapping out campaigns\";[100] he notes however that Sanielevici was \"haughty beyond measure\", and all too imaginative.[57] In later overviews, Jicu found that Sanielevici was \"narcissistic\" and self-promoting, but not an ignorant,[4] while Patra\u015f, who concedes that Sanielevici came up with some new ideas of importance in literary analysis, judges him as one who alternated scientific endeavors with mere journalism.[97]/nAccording to authors such as Ornea and Constantin Ciopraga, Henric Sanielevici was most productive and interesting as a literary theorist, and only so until ca. 1911.[57] At the time, Sanielevici's study of and contribution to Romanian literature sought to uphold the Classical and Neoclassical models, reinterpreted by him through a socialist grid. He suggested that the dominating Neoclassical form promoted through Junimea was in actuality Neoromanticism, and that the only true Neoclassical Junimist was a minor author, Ioan Alexandru Br\u0103tescu-Voine\u015fti\u2014Maiorescu replied, \"both [of Sanielevici's] assessments strike us as strange.\"[101] In defining what he meant by \"Classicism\", Sanielevici continued to borrow from Maiorescu's ideal of \"formal purity\", but expanded it to mean narratives so restrained and so immersing \"that we don't even pay attention to the words\".[102] In his memoirs, Sanielevici ventured to state that his own writing was generally \"more elegant\" than Maiorescu's, and \"precise\" in the manner of 18th-century literati.[4]/nAgainst the Junimists, Gherea's disciple was slowly visualizing an \"optimistic\" and \"balanced\" Classicism that was not aristocratic, but rather could belong to any social class \"at the peak of its domination\".[103] However, in discussing the delayed Romanticism of Mihai Eminescu's work, Sanielevici spoke of \"genius\", and boasted having been the first to describe Eminescu as a poet of European proportions.[4] Leonida Maniu credits him with having been the first exegete to document Eminescu's kinship with German idealism and, in particular, with Novalis' \"magic idealism\".[50] For Doris Mironescu, the work on S\u0103rmanul Dionis remains one of Sanielevici's most commendable efforts.[68]/nLike the Junimists, Sanielevici took a critical view of the historical liberal movement, and in particular of its founding myth, the Wallachian Revolution of 1848. His belief, described by political scientist Victor Rizescu as \"interesting\" and \"intriguing\", was that the Romanian liberals had not been responsible for modernization, but, quite the contrary, had dedicated themselves to imposing an oligarchy over the economy and obscurantism over the national ideology.[104] He described the liberal program of modernization as \"the bitter fruits\" of 1848, and suggested that Romanian conservatism was a complex, sometimes positive, phenomenon,[105] \"the harsh chiding of a parent saddened to see his child taking the wrong path\".[5] Sanielevici believed that criticism of Junimism as a German-imported ideology was \"not entirely exact\", proposing that Romanian conservatism and its German model shared a belief in \"organic\" rather than \"revolutionary\" nation-building.[105] In his account, which became a standard of Romanian scholarship, Junimea happened because a portion of Romania's young intellectuals were exasperated by the continuous revolutionary mood of French politics, and looked into the steadier evolutionism proposed by German teachers.[22] Critical of this perspective, Mironescu dismisses Sanielevici's view of the Wallachian 1848ers as \"proletarian rage\".[68]/nIn sociology, Sanielevici's own contribution rested on Maiorescu's early stance against \"forms without concept\" (or \"forms without substance\")\u2014that is, vague elements of modernization hurriedly imposed on a still primitive society.[104] This affiliation notwithstanding, \"forms without concept\" was used by Sanielevici and other socialists against the very political core of Junimist ideology. Scholar Alexandru George notes the irony that Gherea and his \"baroque\" disciple were reviving a conservative concept in a Marxist context: \"according to the so very slow evolutionism of Junimea, [they themselves] represented a dangerous form without concept, [...] proving that ideas took precedence, and thus, that ideology took precedence over a society's 'needs', in what was a denial of Maiorescu's stance.\"[106]/nSanielevici's early attacks focused on the literary school which promoted ethnic nationalism as the source of artistic truth, namely the magazine S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul and its editor Nicolae Iorga. C\u0103linescu summarized the resulting conflict as follows: \"It was against the nationalist tendentiousness that the intelligent Jewish man H. Sanielevici sought to promote a sort of Classicism, with his Curentul Nou magazine\".[8] In his Curentul Nou manifesto of 1906, Sanielevici suggested that S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torist culture was anti-Western retrogressive autarky, comparing the S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torists themselves to Liberian mulattoes and Chinese Boxers.[5] Furthermore, he argued, Iorga and the others had never lived the lives of their peasant heroes, and had failed to understand the motivations of land laborers.[5]/nBeyond such rhetoric, Sanielevici rejected the traditionalism of S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul right-wingers not because of its didacticism, but because of its supposed inconsistencies. Researchers argue that he was simply prone to attack S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul \"at any opportunity\",[57] and was motivated by the wish to \"counter Iorga\".[68] Overall, Eugen Lovinescu argues, his was a \"sentimental deception\", sparked by the revelation that Iorga's followers were all Neoromantics.[17] Consequently, Sanielevici alleged that the S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torist stories, about violent and promiscuous hajduks, or about modern-day adulterous affairs, set bad moral examples and were needlessly titillating.[5][34][107] He also rejected the heroic portrayals of hajduks and ancient warlords, as a glorification of the \"barbaric past\".[5][8] Politically, Sanielevici believed it was his patriotic duty to react against the \"invasion of the peasants into the cultured layers [of society]\".[4]/nAround 1905, before he joined the Poporanists, Mihail Sadoveanu was the prime target of Sanielevici's anti-S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torism. The Marxist critic was especially reductive when it came to Sadoveanu's \"baroque\" brand of literary naturalism: \"not naturalism, but pure bestiality. Mr. Sadoveanu has the soul of a Wachtmeister. When a Wachtmeister tells you that he 'has lived', it means that he has been to many drunken parties and has had many women\".[34] The first (amiable) split between Ibr\u0103ileanu and Sanielevici was about their different interpretations of Sadoveanu's stories. Outside commentators were perplexed by the obscure rationale of their debate. According to a 1906 column by writer Marin Simionescu-R\u00e2mniceanu: \"That which Mr. Sanielevici finds to be poisonous for our society in Sadoveanu's work, Mr. Ibr\u0103ileanu will judge to be the absolute opposite. [...] Whatever Curentul Nou has said over one page, regarding Sadoveanu's work, is denied on the other. Wouldn't it then have been better not to have said it at all?\"[36] Writing in 2003, literary historian Nicolae Manolescu suggested that the reason was entirely subjective: \"It is practically impossible to comprehend for instance why H. Sanielevici found Sadoveanu's prose to be so violent in subject and primitive in style, while [...] Ibr\u0103ileanu and others readily viewed it as profoundly balanced and artistic in manner.\"[35] Jicu is inclined to believe that Sadoveanu was more the \"collateral victim\" of Sanielevici's attack on Iorga, and that Sanielevici was at his worst in assessing the quality of Sadovenian writings.[34]/nWhile battling Iorga's Neoromanticism, Sanielevici proposed a radical change of themes: he recommended a \"religion\" of balanced and moral life,[17] with literary works about \"regular and assiduous labor, the tranquil family life, honesty, economy, sobriety, diligent industry, and delicate sentiments\".[5][8] As Mironescu writes, Sanielevici's Classicism was averse to nostalgia, frustration and rebellion, and naturally focused on the materially secure social classes.[103] In the early years, his sympathy went to the humanism, literary realism and economic determinism of young novelists coming in from Transylvania, primarily Ioan Slavici\u2014whose books show Romanian peasants holding their ground against feudalism, then capitalism.[5][108] Writing from within this trend, Simionescu-R\u00e2mniceanu ridiculed Sanielevici's moral agenda, and especially the advocacy of universal suffrage by literary means: \"why not also for reforming municipal services in provincial towns, or for introducing soybean cultures in the villages?\"[36] In 2009, Mironescu found the idea of a Transylvanian \"peasant classicism\" to be \"freakish\".[68]/nIn addition, Sanielevici demanded that Romanians revisit \"the ancestral law\" of Romanian Orthodoxy, and noted that the spread of militant atheism was a positive development.[5] C\u0103linescu sees Sanielevici, and \"any Jewish writer\", as actually denouncing the antisemitic component of S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torist nationalism. Sanielevici, he argues, was attacking virility in literature precisely because it highlighted the \"national preservation\" of Romanians, and actually raising awareness about the promised emancipation of the Jews.[8] C\u0103linescu also notes the controversy sparked once Sanielevici's exposed some leading voices of Romanian nationalism, beginning with Vasile Alecsandri, as secret Jews: \"[His] denunciation of various writers' foreignness shows subtle humor, pointing at the rickety nature of claims about one's ethnic novelty.\"[8] C\u0103linescu's younger colleague Dumitru Micu issued a similar objection, arguing that the \"megalomaniac\" Sanielevici displayed a \"cosmopolitan hatred for the nation's past\" (an opinion in turn criticized by Jicu).[57]/nHenric Sanielevici's uncompromising rejection of Romanian liberalism was what separated him definitively from both Ibr\u0103ileanu and Lovinescu. Victor Rizescu argues that Sanielevici's scrutiny of the liberal mindset, answering to liberal theorists such as Lovinescu to \u015etefan Zeletin, reveals a minor voice in social and cultural analysis, but also a powerful exponent of democratic thinking.[109] Lovinescu describes Sanielevici as primarily a Poporanist (\"albeit with intermittent enmities\"), rating him the third figure of importance after \"prophet\" Constantin Stere and militant Ibr\u0103ileanu.[110] Early in the 20th century, he notes, Sanielevici was also the editorial voice of Via\u0163a Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 in its lengthy press debate with Junimist author Duiliu Zamfirescu.[17] Ibr\u0103ileanu himself acknowledged, in 1910, that Sanielevici was \"an intelligent man, with a clear mind, an original way of thinking, [...] a subtle spirit and an elegant form\", who helped Poporanism in its fight against \"decadence\", and who discovered the talents of Br\u0103tescu-Voine\u015fti.[41] In his own analysis of the latter's work, Ibr\u0103ileanu even borrowed from Sanielevici, building on the idea of a readjusted Classicism.[111]/nHowever, in the 1920s, Sanielevici was rekindling Dobrogeanu-Gherea's polemic with his \"reactionary\" Poporanist students, and, according to Lovinescu, was right to do so.[112] With Lovinescu, Zeletin, Vintil\u0103 Br\u0103tianu and some of the younger intellectuals, Sanielevici represented the minority current which supported and justified industrialization and Westernization, against the self-preservation of agrarian lifestyles.[113] As summarized by Jicu: \"The Curentul Nou editor [believed] that, after the war, the Romanian milieu had entered the era of those social changes that Poporanism was hindering. Hence the logical necessity of discrediting it.\"[57] A 1920 notice in Luceaf\u0103rul expressed support for the \"temperamental erudite\" in times of \"social upheaval\", when \"few people understand him and many grumble about him.\"[64]/nLovinescu however remarks that Sanielevici was still committed to the core concept of Poporanism and S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul, namely a \"failure to differentiate between aesthetics and ethics\". In Lovinescu's account, Sanielevici considered himself a new Iorga, and a \"missionary\" among the mass of people: \"aesthetically, he still endures as a Poporanist, albeit one with a different political ideology.\"[112] As noted by Jicu, Sanielevici tellingly oscillated in his reviews of Sadoveanu's Poporanism. A while after the 1905 scandal, he admitted that Sadovenian novels showed an able author, but in 1921 returned to say: \"[Sadoveanu] has since civilized himself, without gathering in talent\".[34]/nBefore 1930, Sanielevici also reached the conclusion that, after an era of realism, a new, \"proletarian\", form of moralizing classicism was emerging in prose. He believed that the novels of international vagabond Panait Istrati, whom he described as vastly superior to Sadoveanu's naturalist works,[34] were an early proof of this change. Sanielevici's idea was received with sarcasm by T. Vianu, who replied: \"Mr. H. Sanielevici, to whom, he informs us, we owe the 'shattering discovery' that realism is always succeeded by classicism, saw in Istrati's Oncle Anghel the affirmation of his theories and the dawn of a new era in moral health. Mr. Sanielevici's proclamation regarding Istrati came with the immolation of one hundred and fifty writers published in contemporary reviews, and this enormous sanguinary drive gave us the surprise of noting that classical moderation does not always keep company with the practice of temperance.\"[114] Vianu also parted with Sanielevici's comments about the supposedly classical quietude and political reformism of Istrati and his protagonists: \"Their moral is not social, because they are not sheltered by it and because they seek to escape its sanctions. [...] That Mr. H. Sanielevici was able to detect in this the representatives of qualified, almost bourgeois, workers is by now only an instructive example of how systemic prejudice may lead astray any particular judgment.\"[115]/nAs Istrati's apologete, Henric Sanielevici hoped to rescue proletarian works from the concentrated attacks of nationalists and traditionalists. According to writer Ioan Lascu, Iorga and Octavian Goga had thrown Istrati's novels into \"the tough mixer of nationalist passions\", while Sanielevici, \"for all his critical servitude\", was agitating for cultural openness.[116] The nationalist reviewer Ion Gorun reacted strongly against \"heimatlos\" Istrati's promotion from the left, denouncing Sanielevici as one of \"our recent guests\", the purveyor of \"spiritual anarchy\" and of \"trumped-up critical nonsense\".[7] In the end, Sanielevici's argument failed to satisfy even his social democratic colleagues. Writing for the socialist newspaper \u015eantier, militant journalist Lothar R\u0103d\u0103ceanu strongly criticized the notion of \"proletarian classicism\". He contrarily asserted that Istrati was the portraitist of unsociable marginals, who had isolated himself from the working class environment.[117]/nSanielevici's novel ideas on politics made it into his other essays. Besides its overall anti-fascism, \u00cen slujba Satanei?!... features his criticism of other public figures, mainly agrarian and Poporanist politicians. The language, C\u0103linescu notes, is \"inimitable\".[1] Sanielevici accuses C. Stere of senility, judges Ibr\u0103ileanu a \"weak critic\", and dismisses Via\u0163a Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 columnist Mihai Ralea, who \"is very bad at coordinating\"; he also describes the post-Poporanist National Peasants' Party as laughable when in government.[1] \u00cen slujba Satanei's other targets are foreign writers and critics whom Sanielevici disliked, from world federalist author H. G. Wells to modernist novelist Andr\u00e9 Gide.[1]/nA constant of Henric Sanielevici's career was provided by his perspective on anthropology, which became his leading preoccupation in the interwar period. For Sanielevici, this came with a new epistemology, which rated \"orientation\" (bridging logic, dialectic and intuition) above all other scientific faculties, prophesying a new stage in social science: the accurate description of deterministic relationships.[118] Using Messianic language (provocatively so, according to Jicu), he stated: \"I am he whom you announce is to come down through the ages. I created the science that is real, cleansed of all conventional lies: the science of causal reports and of laws that coordinate things occurring.\"[4] The Curentul Nou editor also attempted to test his theories in political science and economics, but Doris Mironescu cautions, his efforts there should not be taken for granted.[68]/nSanielevici believed that he had revolutionized knowledge, describing himself as a Newton of biology[1][4][80] and arguing that he had provided the world with the most accurate paradigm of human evolution.[119] Following Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's ideas about the inheritance of habits,[120] Sanielevici deduced anthropology from zoology. According to him, Lamarckism was the only credible school of evolutionary thought; Darwinism, Weismannism, Mutationism and the Vitalism of H. Driesch were all sterile and irrelevant.[121][122] In addition to criticizing Anton Nystr\u00f6m, the Romanian anthropologist reacted strongly against the anatomical theories put forth by Australia's Grafton Elliot Smith, whom he \"damned to hell\",[1] and derided the phrenological collections of Johann Friedrich Blumenbach and Franz Joseph Gall.[42]/nSome of his own essays offered novel explanations to the emergence of biological functions: in an early article for Noua Revist\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103, he reportedly suggested that the purpose of bird singing was the prevention of asphyxia.[123] He later came to the conclusion that the very evolution of mammals was made possible by the abundance or scarcity of food: the ancestors of such animals were arboreal and viviparous reptiles, who evolved into lighter and more agile species while continuously searching for food sources; an exception was the proverbially slow-moving sloth, whose feed, the slugs, was in abundance.[121][124] Sanielevici explained hair growth on mammals (humans included) as an adaptation to humidity, while differences in skin pigmentation reflected exclusively the nature of the soil and the specimen's own blood circulation.[125]/nSuch contributions were received with astonishment or derision by the scientific community, although, C\u0103linescu writes, his \"extravagances\" show \"incontestable intelligence and erudition.\"[1] Jicu notes that the theories he advanced were often \"strong\", \"supported by hard work\", \"extremely inventive\" and \"not that strange as claimed\", but that practice failed Sanielevici.[126] According to Lucian Boia, he was \"an erudite and a dreamer\", with \"a very personal approach\" to social science,[51] while literary historian Dumitru H\u00eencu notes that Sanielevici's \"involuntary humor\" overshadows his \"unquestionable culture\".[80] Some commentators describe Sanielevici as spiritually related to the 19th-century liberal historian Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, and rate their overall approach to research as Romanian pseudoscience.[127]/nSanielevici's interest in the subject of race is steeped in his work as a literary critic, and expands on the theses of more mainstream determinism. This happened once Sanielevici discarded Gherea's Marxism and looked into environmental determinism to record \"the laws that have governed the birth of literary production\", explaining: \"literary criticism led me to study anthropology. The path is, contrary to how one might think, short and straight.\"[119] Gherea's method, he argued, was only applicable on a case-by-case basis, whereas \"racial psycho-physiology\" explained phenomena occurring at a universal scale.[96] Accusing Gherea of having exaggerated and falsified Marxism, he tried to reconcile determinisms with the single formula: \"Class struggle and racial psychology, those are the two factors of social evolution. The latter is more general and more important than the former.\"[96]/nCiopraga notes that, in his \"continuous agitation\", Sanielevici reduced Taine's deterministic concept of \"race, milieu and moment\" to \"climate and food\".[57] Applying Lamarckism to the study of human character, Sanielevici also regarded physiognomy as a relevant clue to evolutionary history. The conclusion, called \"surprising and ridiculous\" by Jicu,[119] was that one's writing style was influenced by race, diet, jawline and even eye color. Reviewing his colleague's ideas in a 1933 essay, Vianu noted: \"In those studies where Mr. Sanielevici builds such considerations, literature effectively turns into a material reused into theories that surpass aesthetics.\"[94] Ornea also notes that such \"fixations\" ruined Sanielevici's literary career, turning him into a \"dilettante\" of anthropology.[57]/nSanielevici partly rejected, partly nuanced, the historical definitions of race and the tenets of scientific racism. C\u0103linescu paraphrases his core idea: \"races are affinities of an anthropological kind, reaching beyond the supposedly historical races.\"[8] Thus, the main criterion available for differentiation and classification of human races was human nutrition. Already in 1903, he argued that Mongols, \"the least mixed\" people of the \"yellow race\", were \"brachycephalic\" because they consumed raw meat, and thus required stronger temporal muscles.[128] In La Vie des mammif\u00e8res..., Sanielevici postulated that racial clusters had emerged around staple foods, corresponding to regional patterns in the Stone Age diet. In his account, a European megaflood had pushed Dryopithecus out of the canopy, replacing its diet with nuts, pushing it toward bipedalism, and then turning it into modern man.[121][129] The Romanian author distinguished five basic racial and dietary types, based on the archeological cultures and each created by its own foodstuff: Aurignacian (allium plants, beans), Chellean (nuts), Magdalenian (fish), Mousterian (snails, fruit) and Solutrean (meat, horses).[68][121][130] These types corresponded to the environmental divisions, respectively: warm steppe, warm woods, tundra, cool woods, cold steppe.[131]/nSanielevici's grid rated the Tungusic peoples as Solutrean, and the modern-day Italian people as \"grass\"-eaters, proposing that the \"impulsive\" behavior of Jews was owed to a high nitrogen intake, from beans.[8] The Han Chinese were descendants of the Aurignacians, having a rice-based \"rodent\" diet, which strained their muscles to create the epicanthic fold.[121] Black people and their Spanish relatives, he conjectured, owed their darker skin to the intoxicating contact with laterites, also responsible for \"impulsiveness\".[132] By 1916, Sanielevici's racial perspectives had incorporated definitions of race popular in early 20th-century scholarship. In this context, he argued that the \"Nordic race\" had created Classicism and epic poetry, that didactic realism was an \"Alpine\" feature, and that \"Mediterraneans\" were at the source of Romanticism.[133]/nThe book and theory were reviewed with much skepticism by the foreign scholars to whom they were addressed. L'Ann\u00e9e Psychologique journal, which noted that Sanielevici was reviving the ideas of Napoleonic era naturalist Georges Cuvier, concluded with irony: \"One evidently needs a rich imagination such as [Sanielevici's] to pierce through the mysteries of paleontological life for animals and humans that have vanished for so long. The author, who has full confidence in his intuition to guide him, has no doubt as to the certitude of his convictions.\"[134] Jean Piveteau, the vertebrate paleontologist, wrote: \"To me, it does not seem worth discussing this new biological theory at length. For sure [...] the reader will identify in it quite a few Lamarckian reminiscences; but [these] will be precisely the most annoying passages from Lamarck\".[135] Biologist Georges Bohn also asked rhetorically: \"[Sanielevici's] excessive imagination, might it not also be the result of spiritual intoxication from the plants and the soil?\"[136]/nThe Romanian scholar sought to redefine the concept of a \"Semitic race\", which he described as fluid and independent of Jewishness. Overall, he found \"Semitism\" in any sexually driven, \"Dionysian\", culture, and concluded that the \"Mediterranean race\" as a whole was Semitic.[137] The Semitic trait was, in his definition, the purest modern stage of the Aurignacian man.[138] In 1930, after reading French archeologist Fernand Benoit, Sanielevici concluded that the Aurignacian-Semitic-Dionysian connection was unaltered among the Berber people of North Africa.[139]/nWith \u00cen slujba Satanei?!..., Sanielevici reacted against Nazism, discussing Germany's racial antisemitism, Aryan race doctrine and racial policies. The text suggested that Adolf Hitler was an Antichrist,[1] and negatively quoted from Eugen Fischer, the Nazi racial theorist, to show that Nazism had perverted earlier forms of racialism.[140] Expanding on his own interpretation of \"Semitic race\" concepts, Sanielevici distinguished between the Jews, who belonged to several races, and the Semites, only some of whom were Jewish. The racial traits, he suggested, were hidden, recurrent and vague: the recessive characteristics made races divisible into \"classes\" and \"subclasses\".[141]/nSanielevici illustrated his point with craniometry, publishing comparative photographs of Jews and ethnically unrelated people (Russians, Frenchmen, Germans), concluding that their physical measurements were nearly identical.[1] He also included photographs of himself and his family, for whom he reused the concept of a \"Dinaric\" race, with Western Asian characteristics.[4][97] Concluding that his own personality was \"Dinaric\", and ethically driven, he also suggested that his son Ipolit (Hyppolyte), was not Dinaric, but \"Dalic\".[1] The latter category was Sanielevici's answer to the Aryan theory: a superior race found in Atlantic Europe, the \"Dalic\" peoples stood above the \"Dinarics\" and the \"Nordic\" Germans\u2014the Nordics being a \"gregarious\" and easily dominated human group.[141]/nThe racial hierarchy implied by such contributions received contradictory, often negative comments from Sanielevici's peers. C\u0103linescu argued that Sanielevici is in fact the voice of anti-racism in the Romanian context, and one who uses racist ideas against themselves.[142] As a supporter of Semitic race theories, C\u0103linescu also wrote that the photographic evidence was inconclusive, since a \"Hebrew note\" of character still set the Jews apart in all samples, including wherever Sanielevici referred to his family.[1] Historian of medicine Marius Turda notes that Sanielevici's pronouncements form part of a larger cultural phenomenon, under which racism and eugenics became fashionable, both within and without the Romanian far right.[76] Although he defines Sanielevici as a \"pro-racist\", researcher Lucian Butaru notes that his ideas questioned the racist mindset of his contemporaries, in the same vein as the Adev\u0103rul columnist Doctor Ygrec (Glicsman) and the conservative anti-fascism of philosopher P. P. Negulescu.[143] He considers Sanielevici's a \"bizarre\" racist discourse, like those of Alexandru Randa or Iordache F\u0103c\u0103oaru, but separated from them by an enduring belief in democracy, and \"less quoted because of [his Jewish] origin\".[144]/nIn his tracts, Sanielevici suggests that the Romanian ethnicity and the Romanian Jewry are both racial conglomerates, not racial entities. He speaks about fundamental differences occurring between people from the distinct Romanian historical regions\u2014Moldavia, Wallachia, Transylvania etc.\u2014with many hybrid individuals straddling the supposed divides.[8] La Vie des mammif\u00e8res... postulated that the Moldavians were Mousterian-Magdalenians originally feeding on fruit, fish and snails, whereas Wallachians (or, more restrictively, Muntenians) represented the Aurignacian-Solutrean mixture\u2014horses in summer, and mainly onions in winter.[9] In later writings, he argued that the whole of Wallachia's population, as well as some Moldavians, fit in with the Semitic and Mediterranean prototype.[137]/nIn 1930, Sanielevici noted: \"22 years ago I was the first to draw attention to the oriental [Sanielevici's italics] character of Romanian peasant art, into which is mirrored the oriental soul of the Thracians\".[145] He also claimed that the \"Dinaric\" and \"Alpine\" subsets, well represented in Romania, ranked better than the \"Nordic\" people, if lower than the \"Dalic\".[141] In C\u0103linescu's interpretation, Sanielevici attributed to the natives of Transylvania some characteristics which were defining for Jews: \"thus [he] fashions himself a Transylvanian and therefore more of a Romanian than the Romanians [from other regions].\"[8] Applying his racial interpretation to Romanian writers, Sanielevici compared traditionalists Alexandru Vlahu\u0163\u0103 and Sadoveanu: the dark-faced Vlahu\u0163\u0103, with his eyes \"black as oil\", was a \"Mediterranean\" and a Romantic, displaying the \"hidden excitement and concentrated nature of a Spaniard\"; Sadoveanu was blond and stocky, therefore \"Slavic\" in appearance and \"Germanic\" in psychology, but also of \"Alpine impulsiveness\".[118]/nA corollary to his anthropological work, religious studies formed a distinct part of Sanielevici's research. Sanielevici believed his work in the field was as groundbreaking as his study of races: \"The research I carried into the history of religions has plainly revealed to me some truths that nobody so far seems to have perceived.\"[1] A primary focus of his work was the differentiation between religious practice at a racial level: the \"Semitic\" or \"Dionysian\" religion grouped together the ancient worship of Osiris, Sabazios and Attis, the Dionysian and Eleusinian Mysteries, Jewish mythology, Berber mythology, the Phallic saints and Waldesian lore.[146] Sanielevici further argued that the fertility rites and chthonic traditions shared between these religious cultures were polar opposites of \"Nordic\" beliefs in the sky gods, and came from the intoxicating properties of the Aurignacian diet.[147]/nIn 1930, basing himself on press reports, Henric Sanielevici turned his attention to the Messianic movements of Bessarabia, and in particular the Inochentist church. The latter had recently broken up with Russian Orthodoxy, forming a Charismatic group with its own version of Christian lore. The Inochentists allegedly preached mortification and sacred prostitution, reminding Sanielevici of the Orthodox sectarian activity depicted by Dmitry Merezhkovsky in his philosophical novels, and reviewed by him as a northernmost afterthought of Semitic-Dionysian religions.[148]/nThe period also witnessed Sanielevici's interest in Paleo-Balkan mythology and the origin of the Romanians, the ancient Dacians, and the supposed Dacian cult leader Zalmoxis. He traced a continuous \"Dionysian\"-type religious practice leading back to the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture (30th century BC), and suggested that there was a connection between Cucuteni pottery markings and the geometric abstraction of modern folk art.[149] In his interpretation, the latter was at once a local variant of Dionysus and the founder of Romanian hesychasm.[149]/nSanielevici believed to have also detected traces of Zalmoxian and Dionysian practice in various elements of Romanian folklore, reading Miori\u0163a as a codified record of human sacrifice in Dacian times.[83][150] Around 1901, he had dismissed Miori\u0163a as a crude and absurd poem, noting that its protagonists displayed a suicidal indifference to murder, \"instead of calling the police\". Literary historian Alex. \u015etef\u0103nescu describes Sanielevici's comment as mere reification, \"as if someone were to ask why King Lear won't book himself a hotel room\".[24] A transition was already evident in La Vie des mammif\u00e8res..., where Sanielevici suggests that Miori\u0163a, like Tristan and Iseult, is a wonderful sample of \"intoxicated\", African-like, mentalities in the heart of Europe.[132] By 1930, Sanielevici had revised his own argument: his Miori\u0163a sau patimile lui Zalmoxis formed part of a resurgence in Dacian studies and essayistics. Writing in 2006, University of Turin academic Roberto Merlo includes it among a list of period works that focused in large part on Zalmoxis, with various interpretations to his story; other authors cited therein include Dan Botta, Mircea Eliade, Alexis Nour, Lucian Blaga and Theodor Speran\u0163ia.[84] As such, Sanielevici's final take on the poem described the shepherd's indifference as a ritualized initiation into death.[85]/nTouched by controversy and repressed by both nationalists and communists, Sanielevici's work has been ignored by the general public in the decades after he died. Marxist sociologist Henri H. Stahl reports: \"Sanielevici is an isolated dissident, read for only as long as a momentary interest lasted for his paradoxical polemics, then forgotten and in any case unable to group around him either disciples or offspring.\"[96] Writing in 2009, Antonio Patra\u015f noted that the sociologist had \"sunk into oblivion even when alive, later to be literally buried into the darkness of totalitarianism\".[97] In 2010, Adrian Jicu described Sanielevici as \"almost unknown\", despite the \"revolutionary\" role he had in the \"interdisciplinary\" study of literature,[151] and despite the pains Sanielevici took to make himself memorable as a \"Dinaric\" racial specimen.[4]/nSome noted figures in cultural history were still inspired by Sanielevici's works in various ways. One Poporanist author is believed to have been directly influenced by Sanielevici during the Curentul Nou years: Octav Botez, later in life a disciple of Ibr\u0103ileanu.[99] As a young man, philosopher and religious scholar Mircea Eliade was \"captivated\" by one of Sanielevici's studies,[123] and \"read all Sanielevici's books.\"[152] According to Eliade, he shared this passion with his high school teacher, the philosopher and socialist theorist Alexandru Claudian, who described Sanielevici as an anthropologist \"of genius\".[152] Sanielevici's work was reviewed by Adrian Marino, the aspiring literary historian, in his debut essay\u2014published in 1939 by George C\u0103linescu's paper Jurnalul Literar.[153] By then, another young author, Petre Pandrea, was shedding light on Sanielevici's Marxist roots, and declaring himself inspired by the critique of \"reactionary\" Poporanism,[66] but also deploring his rejection of \"peasantist\" politics.[154]/nTotalitarian censorship was reversed later during communism, with a spell of relative liberalization. Constantin Ciopraga inaugurated this recovery in 1964, when Luceaf\u0103rul published his study of Sanielevici's literary essays.[57] In 1968, Editura pentru literatur\u0103, a state-run company, reissued Cercet\u0103ri critice \u015fi filosofice with Z. Ornea as editor.[50][97][155] Ornea (according to Jicu, the \"most important\" of Sanielevici revivalists) also wrote a Sanielevici monograph, part of the volume Trei esteticieni (\"Three Aestheticians\").[57]/nAfter the 1989 Revolution, new steps were taken to reclaim and reassess the less debated aspects of Sanielevici's contribution to culture. In 2009, Jicu published with Cartea Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 a new monograph, widely considered an attempt to rekindle interest in the critic-anthropologist: Dinastia Sanielevici. Prin\u0163ul Henric, \u00eentre uitare \u015fi reabilitare (\"The Sanielevici Dynasty. Prince Henric, in between Oblivion and Rehabilitation\").[6][68][97] However, according to Jicu, there are few other 21st-century works dealing with Sanielevici's contribution.[57] Mironescu argues that Jicu's own effort missed the mark: Sanielevici, he argues, was \"compromised\" and \"defeated\" by his own \"tastelessness\" and \"over-the-top verbal violence\".[68]", "13458736": "Ilan Chet  (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d9\u05dc\u05df \u05d7\u05ea) (born April 12, 1939) is an Israeli microbiologist and a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Faculty of Agriculture in Rehovot.

She graduated in 2001, and moved to the West Coast of the United States for graduate studies. She joined the Department of Biological Sciences at Stanford University as a doctoral student.[2] Her research considered the biology of ants and plants in the Amazon rainforest.[3][4]/nFrederickson was inducted into the Harvard Society of Fellows in 2006.[5] At Harvard she worked alongside Naomi Pierce on mutually beneficial relationships in ecology. Together they showed that the ways symbiotic host species employ their symbionts is equivalent to the ways employers treat their workers.[6] The process of mutualism involves species such as plants hosting symbionts such as bacteria. Hosts act to reward cooperative symbionts, such as soybean plants directing food toward specific nodules whilst simultaneously killing off those with unhelpful bacteria. Various theories have been proposed to describe such symbioses, including host sanction theory and partner fidelity feedback. Whilst the former describes a scenario in which the host adapts to punish those who cheat and reward those who cooperate,[7] the latter describes a case where the symbionts evolve to try and please the host. Working with an economist, Pierce and Frederickson showed that employment contract theory and mutualisms could be described by similar mathematics.[6]/nFrederickson joined the University of Toronto in 2009, where she developed a high-throughput method to better understand the interactions between microbiomes and their hosts. She showed that over time, microbes evolve to develop more beneficial relationships with their hosts.[6][8] She studied the relationships between ants and their hosts,[9][10] showing that ants serve to protect their hosts by monitoring the genes responsible for foraging behaviour. These genes decide how the animal forages for food, and how much benefit the partner plants received. When these genes were activated, the ants recruit more workers to attack herbivores, which ultimately protects plans.[11][12]/nIn 2019, Frederickson returned to Harvard University as a medical fellow in the Harvard Radcliffe Institute. During her fellowship she worked on a book that explored the concept of mutualism in ecology,[13] and how it can be used to better understand the microbiome.[5][14]/nFrederickson has written for The Conversation.[15] During the COVID-19 pandemic, she wrote about how people with caring responsibilities \u2013 mainly women \u2013 could not simultaneously balance home schooling, online teaching and scientific research.[16]", "65527105": "Ferdinando Scala (born May 24, 1969) is an Italian biologist, science and technology journalist  and historian, specialized in strategy and military history./nBorn in Portici, he spent his first year of life in Foggia, where his father was servicing as a warrant officer of the Italian Air Force, and then he moved to San Giorgio a Cremano, that he then always considered his hometown.

The \"Squash It!\" meme was incorporated in a wide variety of television programs, films, and rap songs.[11] The \"squash\" gesture, based on the time-out signal in sports, is performed by bringing the palm of a flat hand down onto a vertical clenched fist, forming a stylized \"T\".[12] Though not considered as successful as the designated driver campaign,[11][13] based on a national survey of junior and senior high school students, \"Squash It!\" was found to be particularly influential with African-Americans,[12] its primary target group.[14]/nWinsten headed a communications task force which helped to plan the 1997 Presidents' Summit on America's Future in Philadelphia, chaired by General Colin Powell.

They both suggested that the high diversity of tropical trees was due, in part, to specialist enemies attacking seeds or seedlings that were particularly close to the parent tree or particularly densely clustered, thus preventing any one species from becoming dominant.[27]/nAnother influential idea[2] comes from Janzen's 1967 paper 'Why mountain passes are higher in the tropics'.[28] It proposes that tropical mountains are more of a barrier to species dispersal than temperate mountains because tropical species are less able to tolerate changes in temperature with elevation, having evolved and lived in relatively stable climates./nIn a 1977 paper 'Why fruits rot, seeds mould, and meat spoils',[29] Janzen proposed that microbes render food inedible (or at least distasteful) to vertebrates not just as a by product of microbe-microbe competition or accidental waste products, but as an evolutionary strategy to repel vertebrates consumers, who would otherwise eat the food resource and the microbes themselves. Evidence is mixed, and it is hard to test whether compounds evolved to deter other microbes or vertebrates,[30] but the idea has been widely incorporated into studies of vertebrate feeding from humans[31] to dinosaurs.[32]/nTropical dry forests are the world's most threatened forest ecosystems. In middle America there were 550 000\u00a0km2 of dry forests at the beginning of the 16th century; today, less than 0.08% (440\u00a0km2 ) remains.[33] They have been cleared, burnt and replaced by pastures for cattle raising,[34] at an ever-faster rate during the last 500 years.[33]/nIn 1985, realizing that widespread development in northwestern Costa Rica was rapidly decimating the forest in which they conducted their research, Janzen and Hallwachs  expanded the focus of their work. Janzen and his wife helped to establish the Area de Conservaci\u00f3n Guanacaste World Heritage Site (ACG), one of the oldest, largest and most successful habitat restoration projects in the world. They began with the Parque Nacional Santa Rosa, which included 100\u00a0km2 (25,000 acres) of pasture and relictual neotropical dry forest and 230\u00a0km2 (57,000 acres) of marine habitat.[15] This eventually became the  \u00c1rea de Conservaci\u00f3n Guanacaste, located just south of the Costa Rica-Nicaragua border, between the Pacific Ocean and the Cordillera de Tilaran which integrated four different national parks. Together these house at least 15 different biotopes, viz (mangroves, dry forest and shrubs, ephemeral, rainy season, and permanent streams, fresh water and littoral swamps, evergreen rain- and cloud forests...) and ca. 4% from world's plant, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fishes and insects diversity, all within an area less than 169,000 hectares (420,000 acres).[35] It is one of the oldest, largest and most successful habitat restoration projects in the world. As of 2019, it consists of 169,000 hectares (420,000 acres).[35] The park exemplifies their beliefs about how a park should be run. It is known as a center of biological research, forest restoration and community outreach.[19]/nHabitat restoration is not a simple matter. Not only must one fight against hundreds of years of ecological degradation, manifested in the form of altered drainage patterns, hard to eradicate pastures, compacted soils, exhausted seed banks, diminished adult and propagule stocks, proliferation of fire-resistant and unpalatable weeds from the old world tropics and sub-tropics.[36] \nAlso one is faced with the difficulties of changing a culture which coevolved with, profited from and can become miserable with such a system.[37][38][39]/nFor this reason ACG was conceived as a cultural restoration project, which, to paraphrase its natural counterpart, ought to be grown as well.

His first book in Hebrew, a collection of short stories, was published in 1954 by \"Sifriyat ha-Poalim\"./nIn 1969, a sharp turn in his life occurred (described in the last pages of his autobiographic novel \"Erral\"). It affected his life, thoughts and literary activity ever since. Kalo wrote about it:\n\"First Sunday of the year 1969 AD, twelve noon.\nBody tensed like a bow-string. Not he.\nWarmth rising from the region of the heart. Not he.\nHe stopped being what he was. He will no longer be as\nhe was, forever and ever, for all eternity.\nHe was, he is, he will be, forever and ever, for all\neternity.\"[2] \nIn 1979 an informal group known as \"DAAT\" (Hebrew acronym, meaning knowledge, standing for \"know yourself always\") formed around Shlomo Kalo. This group had a varying number of members or supporters till it disbanded in 2009. Some well-known and influential journalists and artists (Shlomo Bar-Abba, Odetta Schwartz and Rivka Zohar, for example) were associated at times with the group./nIn 2009, the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz reported that rumours were persistent that Shlomo Kalo was among few Israeli writers who had been shortlisted as candidates for the Nobel Prize for Literature,[3] similar reports were made by other news sites in 2010[4] and in 2011.[5]/nShlomo Kalo was married to Rivka Zohar-Kalo, a prominent Israeli singer, who performs and records, among others, songs he has written (music and lyrics).[6]\nShlomo Kalo died at his home on August 30, Shabbat morning. His wife said on a Channel 2 TV interview[7] that his summarizing last words were: \"Everything is excellent to the one who is not subjugated\"./nIn the 1960s two other works of his were published by \"Am Oved\" and won great appreciation. In 1969 he established a publishing house named \"DAAT Publications\", from which he retired after a few years, though he continued to publish most of his following titles there. During the 1970s he translated into Hebrew classical writings of Far-Eastern schools such as: Patanjeli's Yoga verses, The Bhagavadgita, Budha's Dhamapada, Tao-Te-Ching and others. During these years and later in the 1980s Kalo published several nonfiction titles dealing with philosophical, moral and spiritual topics (two out of his seven volumes of lectures were published in this decade). Some other titles were literary fiction about a philosophical issue (\"The Self as Fighter\", \"The Gospel of the Absolute Free Will\" and the novel \"Like the Scarlet Thread\"). A lot of his music and songs were written in this period./nDuring the following two decades Kalo continued to write prolifically in a variety of genres and styles. In the 1990s his first titles written in a newly introduced genre (the so-called \"documented\" stories) were published: \"Forevermore\" and \"Moments of Truth\", as well as his best-selling historical novel title \"The Chosen\", printed in first edition. During these two decades translation rights of some of his books were sold over in 17 countries./nShort stories written by Shlomo Kalo were published in literary magazines in Israel, among them literary supplements of large newspapers. Some of his stories were included in various anthologies celebrating Israel's Jubilee year and other occasions.[8]/nProf. Gershon Shaked (Hebrew University) maintains in his Modern Fiction study (Indiana University, 2000; p 102-3) that Kalo's book \"The Heap\" marked 'two turning points in Hebrew Literary History; the beginning of modernist fiction in Israel, and the advent of Sephardi and Ashkenazi authors who wrote about the immigrant Sephardic community'. \"The Heap,\" prof. Shaked continues, \"has a special place in the history of Hebrew fiction because it is a neo-modernist social protest of an immigrant author\". The novel is built around a number of immigrants who, reflecting their existential crisis, 'embody the archetype of human failure'./nSome 40 out of Kalo's 80 titles were published during the years 2000\u20132011./n1988 was the year when the extensive media exposure of Shlomo Kalo's contemplative and spiritual lifework began. Since that time, messages and solutions to a variety of issues have been both aired by national TV and radio channels, and widely covered by the press.[9]/nDuring the Kosovo Crisis in 1999 Shlomo Kalo was the most prominent Israeli intellectual who publicly protested against US and NATO military attacks on Yugoslavia.[10]/nKalo's books have been translated into: English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Greek, Malayalam, Bulgarian, Portuguese, Korean, Serbo-Croatian, Hungarian, and Romanian.", "70704517": "Mary X.

During this visit, to relatives in Tasmania, his father also died. In rather more impoverished circumstances, Grant Watson was educated at Bedales School and Trinity College, Cambridge (B.A., 1909, with first-class honours in natural sciences) after which, at 24, he joined social anthropologist Alfred Brown (later Alfred Radcliffe-Brown) and Daisy Bates on an ethnological expedition in Western Australia.

He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Medicine each year between 1930 and 1934, and from 1936 to 1939.[1]/nWeigl worked during the Holocaust to save the lives of countless Jews by developing the vaccine for typhus and providing shelter to protect those suffering under the Nazi Germans in occupied Poland.[2] For his contributions, he was named a Righteous Among the Nations in 2003./nWeigl was born in Prerau, which at the time was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to Austrian parents, of Austro-Moravian descent.[3][4][5][6][7] When he was a child, his father died in a bicycle accident.[3] His mother, Elisabeth Kroesel, married a Polish secondary-school teacher, J\u00f3zef Trojnar.[4] Weigl was raised in Jas\u0142o, Poland.[4] Although he was a native German speaker, when the family moved to Poland, he adopted the Polish language and culture.[8]/nLater, the family moved to Lviv (Lw\u00f3w in Polish, Lemberg in German and Yiddish), where in 1907 Weigl graduated from the biology department at the Lw\u00f3w University, at which he had been a pupil of Professors Benedykt Dybowski (1833\u20131930) and J. Nusbaum\u2013Hilarowicz (1859\u20131917).[4] After graduation, Weigl became Nusbaum's assistant, and in 1913 he completed his habilitation which effectively gave him tenure.[9] He then received his doctorate degrees in zoology, comparative anatomy, and histology.[4]/nAfter the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Weigl was drafted into the medical service of the Austro-Hungarian army and began research on typhus and its causes.[4] Weigl worked at a military hospital in Przemy\u015bl, where he supervised the Laboratory for the Study of Spotted Typhus from 1918 to 1920.[10] In 1919, he became a member of a military sanitary council in the Polish army.[10] As he began researching and experimenting, he developed a vaccine./nAfter the invasion of Poland by Germany in 1939, Weigl continued his research and work at an institution in Lw\u00f3w.[10] There, he was able to increase the production of his typhus vaccine. He spent the next four years in Lw\u00f3w focusing his research on developing a vaccine for spotted fever. He led and directed the Institute for Typhus and Virus Research based in Lw\u00f3w. Weigl created a vaccine for spotted fever; the vaccine did not provide full immunity against the disease, but it substantially reduced the symptoms.[11]/nDuring the Nazi German occupation of Poland in World War II, Weigl's research attracted the attention of the Nazis.[10] When they occupied Lw\u00f3w, they ordered him to set up a typhus vaccine production plant at his Institute. Weigl hired several Jewish friends and colleagues for the plant. Weigl employed and protected approximately 2,000 Polish intellectuals, Jews and members of the Polish underground.[12] Many of these people he hired assisted him in his typhus research and experiments with lice. Many of his Jewish associates primarily helped grow the lice and in return, they received food, protection, and doses of the vaccine when it was fully developed.[13] His vaccines were smuggled into ghettos in Lw\u00f3w and Warsaw, various concentration camps, and even certain Gestapo prisons. It was estimated that Weigl was able to save around 5,000 lives during the Nazis' reign.[14]/nIn 1930, following Charles Nicolle's 1909 discovery that lice were the vector of epidemic typhus, and following the work done on a vaccine for the closely related Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Weigl took the next step and developed a technique to produce a typhus vaccine by growing infected lice and crushing them into a vaccine paste. He discovered that a vaccine could be developed from lice stomachs infected with Rickettsia prowazeki, the causative agent of typhus in humans. He developed this first version of the vaccine in 1918 and began experimenting on guinea pigs and even human volunteers. He refined this technique over the years until 1933 when he performed large-scale testing to cultivate bacteria and experiment with the lice using a micro-infection strategy.\nThe method comprised four major steps:/nGrowing lice meant feeding them blood, the more human the better. At first he tested his method on guinea pigs, but around 1933 he began large-scale testing on humans, feeding the lice human blood by letting them suck human legs through a screen. This could cause typhus during the latter phase, when the lice were infected. He alleviated this problem by vaccinating the human \"injectees\", which successfully protected them from death (though some did develop the disease).[15]  Weigl and his wife Zofia Weigl were some of the earliest lice feeders. He developed the disease, but recovered./nThe first major application of his vaccine was conducted between 1936 and 1943 by Belgian missionaries in China. Soon, the vaccines were also administered in Africa.[16] The vaccine was dangerous to produce and hard to make on a large scale. Over time, other vaccines were developed that were less dangerous and more economical to produce, including the Cox vaccine developed on egg yolk./nFollowing the border changes in the aftermath of the war, Weigl moved to Krak\u00f3w in southern Poland. He was appointed chair of the General Microbiology Institute at the Jagiellonian University, and later chair of biology in the medical faculty at the University of Pozna\u0144. He retired in 1951, but production of his vaccine continued for several years.[16]/nWeigl died on 11 August 1957 in the Polish mountain resort of Zakopane at age 73.[9] He was buried at the historic Rakowicki Cemetery in Krak\u00f3w.[17]/nFor Weigl's research and work with typhus at Lw\u00f3w University, Weigl's Institute was created in the typhus research department. The institute features prominently in Andrzej \u017bu\u0142awski's 1971 film, The Third Part of the Night./nWeigl was continuously nominated for a Nobel Prize in the years 1930\u20131934 and 1936\u20131939.[1] Despite these nominations, he never received a Nobel Prize for his vaccine accomplishments or social work.[13]/nA half-century after his death, Weigl's research, work, and service were recognized by many. In 2003, he was honored as Righteous Among the Nations.

She is known for her mentorship and her research on cell properties of cancers and myxospores./nPowelson was born in Hercules, California on August 8, 1916. She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Georgia in 1938. She then attended the University of Wisconsin, completing her master's in 1943[1] and her Ph.D. in 1946.[2][3]/nStarting in 1946, Powelson worked at the College of Agriculture and the Agricultural Experiment Station associated with the University of Maine as an instructor,[4] then assistant professor of bacteriology,[5][6] where she taught courses such as \"Bacteriology for Nurses\".[7] In Maine, she helped to establish the 100th chapter of the Sigma Xi society.[8]/nShe joined the faculty of Purdue University in 1949, still as an assistant professor of bacteriology. At the time, Purdue had recently expanded its Department of Biology into the Department of Biological Sciences which included three branches: bacteriology, botany, zoology and animal husbandry.[9] In 1953, she became an associate professor.[2] She was considered one of the top-ranking women in science in the United States, and taught advanced laboratory courses.[10] During her time at Purdue, she received grants from the Atomic Energy commission for a study on the physiology of hydrogen bacteria,[11][12] the U.S. Public Health service for a project on mycoplasma-infected cells,[13] and the American Cancer Society.[14] She and her student George Allen worked on bacteria cell division patterns to help clarify the differences between normal division and the uncontrolled division of cancer cells. They were interested in creating a \"model culture\" that reproduced in a predictable, repeatable way to facilitate their study.[15] Powelson was also interested in the relationship between bacterial strains and cancers - whether bacteria are a cause of cancer, or may be used against cancer if the cancerous cells are more susceptible to infection.[16] A different project involved studying myxospores, specifically cell membrane properties of Myxococcus Xanthus. She devised a technique to turn vegetative cells into myxospores, a more practical way of generating samples.[17]/nIn 1957, Powelson spent a sabbatical year in Canada at the Laboratory of Hygiene.[18]/nSome of the men at Purdue in bacteriology were critical toward Powelson, suggesting that she did not receive enough grant money. She was not made full professor, though men with similar backgrounds were.[10] In about 1960, Powelson moved to the Stanford Research Institute, where she was senior staff microbiologist, where she continued to research and publish her work. In 1963, she became associate professor at the University of Delaware, Newark in the Department of Biological Sciences.[19][20] In 1969, she received research grant AI-06030-05 from the NIH for \"Factors affecting cytopathogenicity of mycoplasmas\".[21]/nPowelson travelled to conference events and gave talks.[22] Her research presentations covered topics such as \"Shifts in the pathways of glucose oxidation during cell division\" and \"Cytological aspects of the cell membrane of Myxococcus Xanthus\".[23] She was a member of the Society of American Bacteriologists, Sigma Chi, Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Delta Epsilon, Indiana Academy of Science, and Tissue Culture Association.[2] In 1959, she was named Indiana representative to the Society of American Bacteriologists.[24]/nIn her retirement, she moved to Santa Cruz, California. She died in 1988 at age 72.[2] Powelson is remembered as a great mentor for students, women in particular. She introduced them to the field of bacteriology and inspired them to pursue higher education and research work.[25] One of her notable students is Rita Colwell, microbiologist and director of the National Science Foundation.[26] She is commemorated at the University of Wisconsin with a teaching assistant award in her name.[27]/nPowelson was also a proponent of the arts. She was a member of the committee for the promotion of interest in fine arts at Purdue and sponsored a student art competition and exhibition in 1955.[28] She also enjoyed sports and gardening.[10] Her research brought her to Ottawa, Canada where she skied in 1958.[29]", "53206484": "Sheng Tongsheng or Tung-sheng Sheng (Chinese: \u76db\u5f64\u7b19; pinyin: Sh\u00e8ng T\u00f3ngsh\u0113ng; Wade\u2013Giles: Sheng T'ung-sheng) was a Chinese veterinary physician and microbiologist. Sheng was also made contribution to veterinary education, he was the first president of the first independent college of veterinary medicine in China, he is considered one of founders of modern Chinese veterinary medicine.[1][2]/nSheng was born at Changsha in 1911, while his ancestors came from Yongxiu, Jiangxi. He attended Yali High School at age 11. The Northern Expedition extended Changsha in 1926, thereafter he transferred to Kiangsi Provincial No.2 High School./nSheng was enrolled at then National Central University in 1928, he entered Shanghai Medical College as a biology undergraduate in 1934. Later he won the full scholarship to study in German, after the first year at University of Munich, he transferred to University of Berlin, he obtained Dr. Med. in 1936 there. Then he received doctorate in veterinary medicine in 1938./nSheng backed to China in 1938, at first he was a professor at Kiangsi Provincial Veterinary Academy (\u6c5f\u897f\u7701\u7acb\u7378\u91ab\u5c08\u79d1\u5b78\u6821), then he went to National Northwest Associated University and worked there during 1939\u201341. He arrived in Chengdu, and taught at Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Department, National Central University until 1946. Meantime, Sheng overcame the rigours of research during the war, finished the paper \"Virus Encephalomyelitis in Buffaloes\" (Science 15 Mar 1946, Vol.103(2672), pp.\u00a0344\u2013346[3]).", "4578773": "Changes in standards for blood transfusion/nFirst woman to head an NIH laboratory/n/nDr. Margaret Jane Pittman (1901\u20131995) was a pioneering bacteriologist whose research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on typhoid, cholera, and pertussis (whooping cough) helped generate the development of vaccinations against these diseases as well as others.[1] Dr. Pittman was also the first female to lead a NIH laboratory, when in 1957, she was appointed chief of their Laboratory of Bacterial Products, a position she held until 1971.[2] In the 1960s she was a key NIH participant in developing standards for cholera vaccine in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's campaign to control cholera in the region that is now Bangladesh.[3] After her retirement in 1971, she continued to work for the World Health Organization as a consultant on vaccine standards,[4] working in Cairo and Madrid and for the State Institute for Serum and Vaccine in Iran and Connaught Laboratories, Ltd., in Toronto.[5]/nMargaret Pittman was born on January 20, 1901, in Prairie Grove, Arkansas. A descendant of Cyrus Hall McCormick, inventor of the reaper, she was the daughter of a physician, Dr. James Pittman, and Virginia Alice McCormick Pittman. Young Margaret, with her sister Helen and brother James, would often accompany her father in his practice. In 1919, her father died of unsuccessful surgery for appendicitis, leaving instructions that all his children attend Hendrix College in Conway, Arkansas. Her mother supplemented their income as a dressmaker and vendor of canned fruits and vegetables in order to support her children's education at Hendrix College. In 1923, Margaret graduated magna cum laude at Hendrix with a BA in biology and mathematics.[6] She briefly held a teaching position at the Girl's Academy of Galloway College in Searcy, Arkansas, becoming principal of the Academy in her second year.[7] Having saved sufficient money from her teaching to enroll in the University of Chicago, she received a master's degree in bacteriology in 1926 and earned a Ph.D. three years later, under the mentorship of  Dr. Isidore S. Falk. She was supported by a University of Chicago fellowship and a research fellowship from the Influenza Commission of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company./nPittman completed her Ph.D. dissertation work on the pathogenesis of pneumococcus pneumonia after taking a job in 1928 at the Rockefeller Institute in New York to work with Dr. Rufus Cole on the question, \u201cDoes Hemophilus influenza cause influenza?,\u201d one of the perplexing medical problems of that time. Her work on this question led to her discovery that a second (later found to be multiple) strains of the organism existed, some that were encapsulated.  This research permitted the development of an antiserum and later a vaccine known as Hib against the meningitis caused by one strain (known as the b strain) of H. influenza, which often resulted in blindness and sometimes death in younger children.  This research also earned Pittman an international scientific reputation before she was thirty years old./nIn 1934, with the Great Depression gripping the country, Pittman's appointment at the Rockefeller Institute was ended, and, accepting a pay cut, she took a position at the New York State Department of Health Laboratories, where she worked on biologics (vaccines and antisera injected into the human body).[8] In 1935, the U.S. Congress passed and President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act, which included funds to expand health research in the federal government.  The following year, Pittman joined the National Institute of Health (now National Institutes of Health) and worked with Dr. Sara E. Branham, who had been one of her teachers at the University of Chicago, on developing standards for an meningococcus antiserum. As a part of this work, Pittman and Branham introduced the first statistical method, the Reed-M\u00fcnch test, into biologics testing./nDuring World War II, Pittman's work focused on fevers after the administration of blood and blood products.  Her investigations of the process and media used in sterility tests led to changes that protected transfusion recipients. One key change was that a small vial of donated blood be kept separate from the main container of donated blood for sterility testing so that new contaminants could not be introduced on syringes used to withdraw blood for testing./nIn 1943, soon after the Division of Biologics Control had moved to the new Bethesda, Maryland, campus of the NIH, Pittman began work on a standard of potency for a pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine.[9]  In collaboration with Dr. Pearl Kindrick and Dr. Grace Eldering of the Michigan Department of Health, who had pioneered an effective pertussis vaccine but who had been unable to develop a potency assay, Pittman guided the 1949 initiation of U.S. standards for pertussis vaccine, which also became the basis of the international potency requirement of the World Health Organization. This led to a tenfold drop in mortality from whooping cough in the United States between 1945 and 1954. The safety of the vaccine, however, continued to be a vexing issue, especially the risk of neurological reactions similar to those caused by the disease itself.  Throughout the rest of her career, Pittman continued to work on research that would improve the safety of the vaccine./nDuring 1955, Dr. Pittman agreed to serve as president of the Washington Academy of Sciences, which was a one-year term.[10] In 1958, her years of tireless research were rewarded when she was named Chief of the Laboratory of Bacterial Products, a post she held until her retirement in 1971.  The first woman to head an NIH laboratory, Pittman never complained about sex discrimination, but for historians looking back, it is hard not to wonder whether a man who arrived at any institution with an international reputation for research achievements equivalent to hers would have been made to wait twenty years for such advancement./nDuring the 1960s, Pittman worked with the Cholera Research Laboratory in Dacca, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) on a Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) project headed by Dr. Joseph E. Smadel, an associate director at NIH.  After Smadel's sudden death in 1963, Pittman served as project director for five years. With her colleagues, she demonstrated that the potency assay of the cholera vaccine was directly related to the effectiveness of the vaccine. Pittman also served as a consultant to the World Health Organization in formulating the WHO requirement for cholera vaccine.  She participated in WHO comparative laboratory assays of typhoid vaccines and contributed to the development of revised U.S. standards. Finally, with NIH colleagues, Pittman worked out standards for a single injection of tetanus toxoid in pregnant women to protect newborns who, in rural areas of New Guinea, were often delivered unaided and left for a period of time on the bare ground./nIn 1971, Pittman officially retired at the age of 70, but continued to work at the NIH as an \"unpaid consultant.\"[11]  During her prolific career, Dr. Pittman was the recipient of numerous awards, including an honorary LL.D. from Hendrix College and the Federal Woman's Award in 1970.[12] To recognize her mother's hard work in helping her and her siblings pay for their college education at Hendrix, Pittman in 1981 created the Virginia A. McCormick Pittman Distinguished Professorship.[13] She received the EMD Millipore Alice C. Evans Award from the American Society for Microbiology in 1990.[14] In 1994, she was honored with an NIH Lectureship in her name.[15] A collection of her papers is held at the NIH's National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland and an oral history is available from the Office of NIH History.[16] Dr. Pittman died on August 19, 1995, in Cheverly, Maryland and is buried in Prairie Grove, Arkansas.[17]", "2645466": "William B.

He conducted his Ph.D. research and began his post-doctoral research at Rockefeller University in New York City in the laboratory of Nobel Laureate Gerald Edelman. He later completed his postdoctoral research with Edward Ziff at New York University Medical Center./nDuring his time in Ziff's lab, Greenberg observed that the transcription of c-fos, a cellular proto-oncogene, is induced within minutes of activation by neurotrophic factors, one of the first mechanistic descriptions of how cells respond to external signals. This finding in cell culture led to the observation that neuronal activity and even sensory experience can induce c-fos expression in the brain; this  finding is now considered a principal tenet in neurobiology, and is widely used in neuroscience as a bona fide marker of active neurons. The Nobel Prize-winning experiments of Torsten Wiesel and David Hubel in the 1960s showed that visual experience is required during development to establish proper circuitry in the visual cortex, however the cellular and molecular basis for this was unknown. The identification of c-fos, and other activity-dependent genes, provided a molecular mechanism that explained how experience (i.e. nurture) can be coupled with a cellular process (i.e. nature)./nIn 1986, Greenberg moved to Boston, Massachusetts to start his lab in the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics at Harvard Medical School. In 1999, he was named Director of the Neurobiology Program at Boston Children's Hospital.[2][3] In 2008, he became the Department Chair of the Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School.[4]/nThe mission of the Greenberg lab is to understand the mechanisms by which the activity-dependent gene expression program regulates brain development and function.[5] Work from the lab has characterized many of the fundamental steps in this process, from the initial activation of ion channels that depolarize neurons,[6][7] the subsequent downstream signaling cascade[8] that culminates in gene expression, and the pattern of experience-dependent gene expression in particular subtypes of cells in the brain, such as inhibitory versus excitatory neurons.[9]/nThe activity-dependent gene expression program discovered by Greenberg has been shown to play an important biological role in nervous system development and function, specifically in the formation of inhibitory circuits in the brain. Greenberg and colleagues showed that through introduction of a mutation in a particular site in the promoter of the activity-dependent gene, Bdnf, visual experience was unable to induce Bdnf expression in the cortex of mice. Moreover, the authors found that the formation of inhibitory synapses and circuits was disrupted in these animals.[10] The authors found no effect in excitatory synapse formation or function./nIn addition to this finding, the Greenberg lab also discovered NPAS4, an activity-dependent transcription factor that is required for inhibitory synapse formation through its regulation of Bdnf transcription, and other activity-dependent genes.[11] Similar to their previous finding, the authors found a specific role for this genetic program in inhibitory circuit development, since perturbation of NPAS4 function had no effect in excitatory synapse formation or function. Thus, the activity-dependent gene program plays a key role specifically in the development of inhibitory circuits in the cortex, which are responsible for fine-tuning neuronal output and nervous system function./nIn 2010, the Greenberg lab discovered a new class of RNAs called enhancer RNAs (eRNA), RNAs that are transcribed from enhancer regions of chromosomes.[12] Greenberg and colleagues found that eRNAs are transcribed in response to neuronal activity, and function to control the expression of other genes in cells. The role of eRNAs in regulating gene expression in health and disease is continuing to be explored in various fields, such as cancer research./nHis research has also explored the molecular biology and genetics of autism spectrum disorders, specifically in Rett Syndrome, a disease that is caused by mutations in MeCP2, a methyl-DNA binding protein that regulates transcription. His studies have examined the experience-dependent gene program in mouse models of Rett Syndrome, and specifically, how mutations in MeCP2 disrupt the expression of particularly long genes in the brain.[13]/nThe Greenberg lab is also studying activity-dependent gene expression in human neurons, and is comparing this program of gene expression to other mammals and other primates. In 2016, he and his colleagues identified a gene that is selectively induced in human and primate brains following stimulation.[14] They found that the gene, called osteocrin, while expressed in mouse bone and muscle, is not detected in rodent brains, and that its inducible expression in primate neurons is conferred by the evolution of DNA regulatory elements that bind the activity-dependent transcription factor, MEF2./nGreenberg is the author of more than 200 articles and serves on the editorial boards of the following journals, among others: Journal of Neuroscience; Learning & Memory; Neuron; and Molecular & Cellular Neuroscience.[15][16] He has mentored a number of successful neuroscientists, including Morgan Sheng, David Ginty, Azad Bonni, Anne Brunet, Anirvan Ghosh, and Hilmar Bading./nGreenberg has received numerous prizes, including the Edward M.

Her education focused on science and research where she developed a passion for microbiology. Her peers and teachers knew her as a quick learner and a bright student. In 1948, she teamed up with Rachel Fuller Brown to develop nystatin, the first non-toxic drug treatment for fungal infections in humans. Her research had multiple applications ranging from saving infected trees to restoring paintings and artwork damaged due to mold./nElizabeth Lee Hazen was born on August 24, 1885, in Rich, Mississippi, to William Edgar Hazen and Maggie Harper Hazen. She was their second daughter and middle of three children.[1][2] Her parents died when she was four, and the three children were adopted by an aunt and uncle.[1][3]/nHazen attended the Mississippi University for Women (then Mississippi Industrial Institute and College), and obtained a Bachelor of Science degree there in 1910.[3] While teaching biology and high school physics in Jackson, Mississippi, she continued her education by attending summer schools at the University of Tennessee and University of Virginia. Following her teaching job, Hazen applied and was accepted into the Department of Biology at Columbia for graduate studies. She completed a Master's of Biology at Columbia University in 1917 and a Ph.D. in microbiology there in 1927, one of their first female doctoral students.[1][3] She served as an Army diagnostic laboratory technician during World War I.[4] In the 1920s, while studying at Columbia University, Hazen worked with ricin and its effect on Clostridium botulinum toxin.[5]/nWith her strong science background and experience in the field, Hazen continued her research in bacteria and immunology. She was presented with an opportunity in 1931 to work with the New York State Department of Health. She accepted and worked in the Bacterial Diagnosis Laboratory Division in New York City. She had several major accomplishments there in the field of bacterial diagnosis. Among her works there were tracing an outbreak of anthrax, locating sources of tularemia, and tracing the source of food poisoning from improperly preserved foods./nFrom there, she worked at the New York office of the Division of Laboratories and Research of the State Department of Public Health. There she learned, trained, and studied about fungi and fungal diseases. She had picked up a project there and started producing her own culture collection. This collection and the research along with it helped place her name in the National Inventors Hall of Fame./nIn 1944, she was chosen by Augustus Wadsworth, founder and head of the division, to be in charge of an investigation into fungi and their relation to bacteria and other microbes. In addition to a microbiologist (Hazen), a biochemist was also needed, and Rachel Fuller Brown was chosen.[6] Hazen started researching and studying fungal diseases, specifically ones that had been widespread in the city. This included diseases such as pneumonia and moniliasis (thrush), a mouth condition that makes swallowing painful. She had a growing collection of fungi and was studying the effects and possible antifungal agents. However, Elizabeth needed someone to identify and isolate the antifungal activity occurring within samples. She was introduced by Dalldorf, the direction of the division in Albany, in 1948 to Rachel Fuller Brown, who had a laboratory in Albany./nTheir research started by collecting soil samples from all over the country. Dr. Hazen cultured Actinomycetes (microorganisms most frequently having antifungal properties) from each sample and tested them to see if any fungal activity was present. If any activity was found, the soil sample was shipped to Albany, where Dr. Brown prepared samples and extracts from the cultures by isolating the chemical agents that appeared to have the property of killing fungi. These new samples would then be shipped back to New York City, where Hazen would test the samples again for toxicity. She would expose the organisms against two fungi, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. She would then purify promising samples for further test of fungistatic and fungicidal activity./nIn 1948, Hazen and Brown began searching for an effective antifungal agent. Hazen found a promising micro-organism in the soil of a friend's dairy farm.  She named it Streptomyces noursei, after William Nourse, the farm's owner.[7] S. noursei was found to produce two antifungal substances. One turned out to be toxic for mice, but the other, when purified, turned out to be effective against candidiasis and a fungus that invaded the lungs and central nervous system. In 1950, they presented their discovery, the first safe and effective antifungal antibiotic, to the National Academy of Sciences.[8] They originally named it fungicidin, but later renamed it nystatin, in honor of their employer, the New York State Department of Public Health.[6][9]/nIn fall 1950, Dr. Hazen and Dr. Brown announced at a National Academy of Sciences meeting that they had successfully produced two antifungal agents from an antibiotic. This led to their development of nystatin (named in honor of the New York State Public Health Department), the first fungicide safe for treating humans. After several animal and human studies proved satisfactory to the FDA, nystatin was put into the market through E.R. Squibb & Sons in 1954 and earning over $135,000 in its first year. Hazen and Brown donated their royalties, over $13 million, to a trust fund established under both Hazen and Brown for science and advancing women in science./nNystatin (antifungal / antibiotic)\nPatent Number: 2,797,183/nA patent was filed in late 1950 for nystatin. It took Hazen, Brown, and Squibb Research Company six and half years to secure a patent for the invention. Two reasons caused the delay. First, testing had to be done to prove the utility of the product. This required animal and human trials to be conducted for FDA approval. Nystatin was granted approval by the FDA and released by Squibb in 1954. In addition, an article published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology in 1954 suggested Hazen and Brown exposed methods of nystatin in another article previously published in 1949. If this were the case, then it would have been over a year before a patent was filed, rendering the pending patent useless. However, after research and a signature by the author of the 1954 article stating there was no connection, the U.S. Patent Office issued a patent on June 25, 1957. It covered nystatin and the method of preparation for the next 17 years.\nHazen and Brown obtained the patent in 1957.[10]/nHazen continued to do research in laboratory in her later years as her experience and skills were very useful and beneficial to those around her. She continued to study the several uses of nystatin for other diseases and conditions./nTowards the end of her life, she received a series of awards for her success, including the Squibb Award in Chemotherapy, the Rhoda Benham Award of the Medical Mycological Society of the Americas, an honorary degree from Hobart and William Smith Colleges, and the Chemical Pioneer Award of the American Institute of Chemists. After her death, Hazen was nominated and accepted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1994.[8]", "33742324": "Quentin Bone FRS[1] (17 August 1931 \u2013 6 July 2021) was a British marine biologist.

Koopman demonstrated that activity of mouse homologues of the existing candidate, ZFY, was not consistent with a role in sex determination.[5] Lovell-Badge's team, collaborating with Peter Goodfellow and colleagues at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London, discovered a new candidate gene, Sry.[1][6]  Koopman and colleagues injected Sry into fertilized XX mouse eggs which as a result developed as males, thus proving the male sex-determining role of Sry.[3] The discovery is regarded as one of the major achievements in molecular genetics in the 20th century./nMuch of Koopman's subsequent research has focused on understanding how Sry acts to direct the formation of testes in the embryo, triggering male development. This work has involved the identification and/or study of a large number of other genes involved in development of the testes or ovaries.[7]/nEstablishing his own research group[8] at the University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia in 1992, Koopman set out to discover new members of a growing family of genes related to Sry \u2013 \"Sox\" genes.[9][10] Among the first discoveries was Sox9,[11] a key regulator of skeletal and testis development, which carries mutations in humans with the skeletal disorder campomelic dysplasia and associated XY sex reversal.[12]/nKoopman's group also discovered Sox18,[13][14] a switch gene that directs formation of the lymphatic vessels,[15] and is defective in humans with hypotrichosis-lymphedema-telangiectasia syndrome.[16]  Given the role of lymphatic vessels in tumour metastasis, Sox18 is being developed as a potential drug target for anti-metastatic cancer therapy.[17]/nKoopman found that the human and mouse genomes contain 20 Sox genes,[18] and he proposed the naming system for Sox genes that continues to be used today.[19]/nKoopman's early work with Anne McLaren spawned an interest in the regulation of the germ cells during fetal development\u2014cells that later become sperm or oocytes.[20] His group discovered that the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid stimulates germ cells to enter meiosis, a critical step in the formation of gametes.[21] They also demonstrated that the developmental signaling molecule Nodal and its receptor Cripto regulate male germ cell pluripotency in the fetal gonad,[22] opening the way for new non-invasive diagnostics and targeted additional therapies for testicular cancers.[23]/nWith a growing interest in human variations of sex development (alternatively known as DSD, differences or disorders of sex development, variations in sex characteristics, or intersex), Koopman began to engage with relevant clinicians and intersex advocacy and support groups.

Junying Yuan attended Fudan University following the revival of higher education after its suspension under the Cultural Revolution. She was among the first wave of students to attempt the newly revived National Higher Education Entrance Examination in 1977, coming in first of all students who attempted it in Shanghai.[citation needed]  She completed her bachelor's in biochemistry in 1982, and was subsequently one of the first students admitted to doctoral study in the United States through the China-U.S. Biochemistry Examination and Application (CUSBEA) program, coming in second out of the 25,000 who attempted the CUSBEA in its first year.[5]/nIn the United States, she completed her  Ph.D. in Neuroscience(1989) at Harvard University under the supervision of MIT professor H. Robert Horvitz, where she endeavored to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind programmed cell death in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. She identified the proteins ced-3 and ced-4 as drivers behind programmed cell death in C. elegans, and subsequently identified the mammalian homologue of ced-3 known as interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme(ICE), later called caspase-1.[2][3][6]/nJunying Yuan established an independent lab at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital in 1989, immediately upon completion of her Ph.D. [5] Her initial efforts were directed towards providing evidence for the functional role of caspases in mediating mammalian apoptosis.[7][8]  Her independent work at this stage provided the first insights into molecular mechanisms in mammalian apoptosis, which contributed significantly to the Nobel Prize in Chemistry won by her Ph.D. supervisor, Robert Horvitz.[9]/nIn 1996, Yuan moved her lab to the Department of Cell Biology at Harvard Medical School's Longwood campus, where she continued her investigation into cell death. Her work delved further into programmed cell death and revealed a wide cohort of proteins involved in the regulation and consequences of apoptosis. Some notable work includes her discovery that BID cleavage by caspase-8 mediates mitochondrial damage in apoptosis,[10] and her discovery of caspase-11's role in regulating caspase-1-driven inflammation.[11]/nIn 2005, Yuan's group discovered a non-apoptotic form of programmed necrotic cell death, which they termed \"necroptosis\".[4] Other groups first observed that the stimulation of Fas/TNFR family of death-domain receptors (DR) activated a canonical apoptotic pathway; however, in many cell types, not only did caspase inhibition fail to inhibit cell death, as would be expected of canonical apoptosis, but stimulated cells experienced a form of cell death that more closely resembled necrosis than apoptosis.[12] Yuan's group conducted a chemical screen that identified a small molecule capable of inhibiting DR-driven cell death, necrostatin-1, and demonstrated necroptosis' role in ischemic neuronal injury, thereby positing a potential role for necrostatin-1 in stroke treatment. Her group then identified RIPK1 as the target for necrostatin-1,[13] thus implicating it as a key player in necroptosis./nYuan went on to identify and characterize members of the signaling network responsible for regulating necroptosis,[14] and continues to elucidate the mechanisms of necroptosis while exploring its potential as a target of therapeutic intervention. Necrosis was previously considered to be a form of passive cell death, forced in response to stress. This belief had driven an aversion towards developing therapeutic applications targeting necrosis. In demonstrating a form of programmed necrosis, Yuan's work revealed new avenues of treatment for an ever-increasing cohort of diseases where necroptosis is implicated.[15] As of 2019[update], small-molecule inhibitors of RIPK1 have advanced beyond Phase I human clinical trials for the treatment of various inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and Crohn's disease.[16]", "6544971": "Shiv Darshan Lal Chopra[1] (1933\u00a0\u2013 7 January 2018), commonly known as Shiv Chopra, was a Canadian microbiologist and human rights activist. Chopra stood for food safety and testified before the Senate of Canada in defending the public from hormones, antibiotics, genetically modified organisms, rendered animal proteins, and pesticides./nChopra was involved in one of the first major whistleblowing incidents in the Public Service of Canada.[2] Chopra was also involved in the second systemic racial discrimination case in the Canadian public service, when it was found by a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal that his employer, Health Canada had discriminated against him on the basis of his race.[3]/nBorn in Kapurthala, Punjab, India, Chopra studied veterinary medicine at Punjab University in Chandigarh, receiving the degree Bachelor of Veterinary Science & Animal husbandry in 1957. For graduate study he went to Indian Veterinary Research Institute at Izatnagar, obtaining in 1960 his diploma in the production and standardization of vaccines and sera.[4] He relocated to Montreal, Quebec and studied microbiology at the Macdonald Campus of McGill University, obtaining a master's degree in 1962. His research induced enteritis by early weaning of piglets to obtain samples of e-coli for study.[1] Chopra was awarded the Ph. D in 1964./nFor 1965 the Medical Research Council of Canada granted him a fellowship to work with Bram Rose in the Division of Immunochemistry and Allergy at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal. Subsequently, \nMiles Laboratories hired Chopra to direct its Biological Research Division in Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, England until 1969. He assisted in applications to regulatory agencies for new products.\nChopra then returned to Canada where he worked with Health Canada, first as a senior scientific advisor in the Bureau of Drugs until 1987, and then in the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs until 2004.[5]/nIn 1998 he became a member of the rBST gaps analysis team at Health Canada, investigating effects of bovine growth hormone in milk and human vulnerability to this molecule produced by genetic engineering. His opinion was that approval of this dairy enhancement was not warranted. He testified before the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry of the Senate of Canada 22 October 1998, 26 April 1999, and 3 May 1999.[4]/nShiv Chopra died on 7 January 2018.[6]/nIn 1992 and 1993, Chopra initiated two human rights complaints against Health Canada, citing discrimination on the basis of race and national origin.[7]  On the basis of the ruling of the tribunal in March 1996, Health Canada was ordered to make a series of corrective measures over a five-year period.[8]  In August 2001, the tribunal rendered a second decision finding that Health Canada had discriminated against Chopra on the basis of his race,[9] and specifically had altered job evaluations for Chopra in order to bolster its defense.[3]/nThis was one of two major cases of systemic racial discrimination in the Canadian public service.  In 1992 and 1994, the National Research Council of Canada, a government scientific agency, was found by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to have systemically discriminated against Chander Grover, an expert in optics and photonics, on the basis of race, colour and national origin.[10][11]/nIn 1998 and 1999, Chopra, along with two co-workers, Margaret Haydon and Gerard Lambert, testified to the Senate of Canada's Standing Committee on Agriculture and Forestry that they were pressured by senior supervisors to approve multiple drugs of questionable safety, including Bovine Growth Hormone (rBST) and Baytril, which in the words of Chopra, \"is even more controversial. It's a critical antibiotic, one that produces cross-resistance against a critical antibiotic necessary for human use called ciprofloxacin. It's from the same class of drugs. When it is used in poultry, beef, turkeys, pigs, or whatever, then it causes cross-resistance in the intestines of those animals. Then those bacteria, like Salmonella, Campylobacter, or E. coli, get transferred to people and cause disease and death of immense order.\"[12][13][14]  Prior to the mad cow disease crisis in Canada, Chopra warned the government that the current handling of feed to cows was inadequate.[15]  Following this, Chopra, Haydon, Lambert and colleague Chris Bassude complained to the Public Service Integrity Officer (PSIO) office, a federal investigative body under the jurisdiction of the Treasury Board of Canada, indicating again that they were pressured by their seniors to pass a number of veterinary drugs, including Tylosin, Revalor H, Synergistin Injectable Suspension, Baytril, rBST, Carbodex and Eugenol, without proof of human safety.[16][17] The PSIO case was initially dismissed in 2003, but the ruling was appealed to the Federal Court of Canada./nIn June 2004, Chopra, Haydon and Lambert were fired from Health Canada.[15]  Health Canada denied that the trio was fired for speaking publicly about the pressure employed by their supervisors to approve the usage of a number of animal drugs, but did not reveal the exact reason, mentioning that the reasons were confidential and included in the letters of termination the three scientists received.[18]  Chopra's letter revealed that the stated reason for his dismissal was his \"total lack of progress\" in a current project.[18]/nThree weeks later, Chopra received a congratulatory letter and a gold watch from Deputy Health Minister Ian Green, declaring that his \"years of service have not gone unnoticed\" and that he had \"earned praise and respect.\"[18]/nOn April 29, 2005, the Federal Court of Canada quashed the previous finding of the PSIO, and found that the PSIO had inadequately handled Chopra, Haydon and Lambert's complaints.[17]  The Federal Court's decision called into question the credibility of the PSIO, citing a failure in the organization in protecting whistleblowers acting in good faith.[16][17]\n[19]  As of 2009 it appears that the PSIO or its successors has still not issued a new ruling on the case,[20] although Chopra's case is mentioned in a history of managing in ethics in public service issued by the human resources office of Canada's Treasury Secretariat (which oversees the PSIO).[21]/nIn September 2008, Human Rights Tribunal (HRT) adjudicator Pierre Deschamps ruled that Chopra was entitled to $4,000 in damages for \"hurt feelings\", lost wages, and interest after finding that Chopra was subjected to discriminatory comments, was suspended in retaliation for filing an earlier human rights complaint, and was discriminated against when passed over for a temporary promotion. Chopra's \"hurt feelings\" were in response to a 1998 speech by an incoming superior at Health Canada, during which the speaker stated that \"he liked visible minorities.\" In his complaint, Chopra claimed this was a \"deeply insensitive racial remark toward visible minority employees of the bureau.\" Deschamps accepted Chopra's argument, writing that Lachance's remark was \"discriminatory against Mr. Chopra as well as individuals \u2026 who were non-white\" and that Lachance's remark showcased his insensitivity. Deschamps criticized the racist nature of Lachance's remark. Deschamps also stated that the supervisor's intent was irrelevant, as: \"The test is, over and above the racial nature of the comment itself, whether or not the person alleging discrimination was offended by the comment.\"[22][23]/nAlthough the tribunal ruled in favour of Chopra on some points, it also chastised him for \"asserting that every manager at Health Canada practises racial discrimination, and for alleging that every appointment in the past 20 years has been discriminatory\" and that such sweeping assertions, made \"without a proper evidentiary basis,\" undermine Chopra's credibility. Several other complaints by Chopra that he was passed over for promotions because of his race were also dismissed.[23] The tribunal also ruled that \"there is no reason for the Tribunal to conclude that systemic discrimination still exists at Health Canada and to order it to take additional measures to address general or systemic issues of discrimination.\"[22]/nJonathan Kay of the National Post criticized the decision, alleging that Deschamps accepted Chopra's claim without any \"substantive explanation.\"[24]/nShiv Chopra identified his life so completely with his whistleblowing at Health Canada that his autobiography is nearly all about his work protecting Canadians from unsafe products being pushed through approval.[5] In 1974 Chopra sat for an interview for a shift in position at the Bureau of Drugs. He was asked, \"Suppose you are selected for this post, whom would you consider to be your client?\" Chopra replied, \"The public, of course.\" The interviewer replied, \"No, it is the industry.\" Chopra insisted that the mandate of the position was Parliament's Food and Drugs Act (page 19). Such unabashed subservience of supervisors to corporate influence convinced Chopra that Health Canada was Corrupt to the Core - Memoirs of a Health Canada Whistleblower, the title of the autobiography. One aspect of his whistleblowing was flagging obstructions to advancement, which he grieved and sued. The major conflict was approval of unsafe products:/nAll these managers expected everyone to follow as government policy expecting the departments' own scientists to pass products of questionable safety. Among the products that they were expected to pass were growth hormones, antibiotics and drugs to be used in food-producing animals in order to obtain extra yields of meat and milk. The potential harm that these products could cause in consequence of passing them into the food supply included cancer, immune and reproductive disorders, antimicrobial resistance, and other effects in people.[25]/nAs a whistleblower has a daunting task of standing up to an institution, Chopra demonstrated the importance of documentation and public relations. Some family background and the wedding with Nirmala fill the first chapter, but most of 295 pages of text recount bureaucratic battling. The names and positions of 120 interlocutors in government are listed (pages 323-6). An appendix gives 20 pages of reproductions of key correspondence. Furthermore, Chopra lists 59 print media reports, 11 radio or television shows, and a bibliography of media sources, special reports, books and letters. Prefaces to the autobiography were supplied by Maude Barlow and MP Paul Dewar./nIn an epilogue, Chopra recounts a trip to Powell River, British Columbia, where he met with organic farmers. He experienced an epiphany while speaking to them. He summarized his expression in this declaration:/nIt is our divine right as people of God and our constitutional right as people of Canada to eat and feed our families the food that the earth produces naturally. Therefore, we demand all contaminants in our food supply be banned by an act of Parliament. The five items in question include: Hormones, antibiotics, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), rendered animal proteins, and pesticides./nSince people in any country might aspire to such protection, Chopra stated, \"Canada is a key country in which to launch such an action.\" (page 295) Chopra acknowledged assistance from The Council of Canadians to spread the word for food safety.[26]/nOn November 14, 2011, Chopra, Haydon and Lambert became the first recipients of the Canadian Journalists for Free Expression Integrity Award, in recognition of their role as \"individuals who acted courageously in the public interest without thought of personal gain, and in doing so risked reprisals in the form of threats to their careers, livelihood, or personal freedom.\"[27]", "1597005": "Waldo LaSalle Schmitt (June 25, 1887 \u2013 August 5, 1977) was an American biologist born in Washington, D.C.

During his sojourn at Pesaro he received an invitation from the municipality of Ragusa,[1] After staying for some months he left the city for Thessaloniki, which then had a large Jewish community and was part of the Ottoman Empire; there he openly professed the Jewish faith and finally died in 1568./nHe discovered the circulation of the blood, and through dissections of the Azygos vein, he was the first to observe and speculate about the venous valves found there./nThis discovery contradicted the conventional belief of the time that the blood flows from the heart via the arteries as well as the veins. It is obvious that this hypothesis was supported by the fact that the network of arteries and veins becomes thinner and thinner as they get farther from the heart. It was also assumed that the networks are not connected, so the blood cannot pass from one network to the other. (The microscope was not yet invented, so one could not view capillary arteries without aid.)/nDr. Amatus Lusitanus described in the  Centuria I,  paragraph (Curatio) 513, how, in 1547, he performed an experiment before some scholars from the University of Ferrara. He blew air into the lower part of the azygos, and showed that the vena cava would not be inflated. It was not possible for the air to escape because of the valve or operculum mentioned.  When  it is clear that if air cannot pass out of the azygos into the vena cava, it is all the more certain that blood, much thicker than air, could not flow through. In the audience was \"the admirable anatomist\u201d Giambattista Canano, to whom the discovery of the valves was attributed later by mistake./nAmatus enriched medical literature with several valuable works which for a long time enjoyed the highest reputation. Among these the most important was his Centuri\u00e6, in which he published accounts of his cases and their treatment. This work, in seven volumes, entitled Curationum Medicinalium Centuri\u00e6 Septem, passed through a number of editions (Florence, 1551; Venice, 1552, 1557, 1560, 1653; Basel, 1556; Leyden, 1560, 1570; Paris, 1620; Bordeaux, 1620; Barcelona, 1628).

She was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2021./nBartolomei was an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland, College Park, where she majored in biochemistry.[1] She was the first member of her family who graduated from college.[2] Her doctoral research considered mouse RNA polymerase.[3] After earning her doctorate she moved to the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where she was part of the cellular and molecular biology programme.[1][4]/nBartolomei was a postdoctoral fellow in laboratory of Shirley M. Tilghman at Princeton University.[5] Here she identified H19, one of the first imprinted genes.[6] She found that this gene was part of an imprinted gene cluster that included the Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) gene.[5] Bartolomei identified that imprinted genes are regulated by methylated imprinting control regions (ICR). The mouse models developed by Tilghman and Bartolomei helped to identify that it was genetic mutations on H19 that cause Silver\u2013Russell syndrome. Microdeletions on the H19 ICR have been associated with Beckwith\u2013Wiedemann syndrome./nAs a postdoc Bartolomei showed that DNA methylation was essential in conferring the parental identity of imprinted genes. Specifically, loss of the maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1 can disrupt imprinted gene expression in both the placenta and the embryo.[6]/nIn 1993 Bartolomei joined the faculty at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. She dedicated her career to understand genomic imprinting, an inheritance process that results in unequal expression of the maternal and paternal alleles of genes.[1] Amongst these genes, Bartolomei has continued to study H19. She found that when the gene was activated in the blastocyst mouse models demonstrated maternal-specific expression./nThese mouse models allowed Bartolomei to identify that assisted reproductive technologies (including in-vitro culture, embryo transfer, in vitro fertilisation and hormonal hyperstimulation) can contribute to errors in epigenetic gene regulation. She has investigated the role of the transcription factor CTCF. She found that in the absence of CTCF, H19 becomes hypermethylated and embryos die early in development.[6] She went on to show that CTCF was crucial in early development and very involved with gene activity.[6]/nHer research has considered X-inactivation in mice; the process by which female mice silence oneX chromosome to achieve the same X-linked expression as male mice.[1]/nBartolomei is married with two daughters.[2]", "43114158": "Roberts Rugh, Ph.D. (16 April 1903 \u2013 11 November 1978), radiation biologist and embryologist./nRoberts Rugh was born to Arthur and Gertrude (Roberts) Rugh in Springfield, Ohio on April 16, 1903, and died on 11 November 1978 in Bethesda, Maryland.\nRugh married Harriette Sheldon on July 24, 1926, and the couple had two children, Mary Elizabeth (Rugh) Downs and William Arthur.[1]/nRugh earned his A.B.

As a woman of science, she advocates and works towards improving healthcare for women.[4] Pineda-Cortel has also done research covering many health-related issues that include the effects of climate change on infectious diseases that are prevalent in the Philippines, such as dengue and malaria.[5]/nPineda-Cortel studied at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, Philippines where she received all of her degrees: Bachelor of Science in Medical Technology, Master of Science in Medical Technology, and Doctor of Philosophy with a major in Biological Sciences.[6]/nPineda-Cortel focuses her research on early-detection and diagnosis of GDM in pregnant women in the Philippines. The prevalence of GDM in the Philippines is around 30%, and Pineda-Cortel aims to increase accessibility and availability of standard diagnostic and screening tests for GDM to prevent further health complications in the mother and the baby.[4] Her goal is to find early genetic biomarkers that can be identified in pregnant women to prevent the development of GDM. She carries out her experiments by collecting blood samples every trimester from a group of pregnant women with no diabetes (non-GDM group) and another group of pregnant women that have diabetes before pregnancy and/or had GDM during past pregnancies (GDM group). The RNA from the blood samples are then analyzed through differential gene expression to compare the read counts of relevant genes between the non-GDM group and the GDM group during first, second, and third trimester.[7] In one of her studies, she concludes that the gene variant rs7754840 of the  CDKAL1 gene (known to inhibit insulin production) does not increase susceptibility to GDM.[8] Another one of her studies also suggests that iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women decreases the risk of developing GDM.[9] Pineda-Cortel's research is an effort to end the cycle of transgenerational diabetes as its prevalence continues to increase all over the world.[10]/nPineda-Cortel also does research to determine the effects of climate change and other environmental factors on dengue incidence and number of cases per region. Her studies show a strong correlation between the incidence of dengue and temperature, rainfall and humidity. Because the Philippines lie in the tropics, these three climate variables are the main driving force of dengue fever. Warmer temperatures speed up the extrinsic incubation period of the dengue virus and the development of mosquitoes which increases disease transmission rates. In addition, her research also demonstrates that rainfall contributes to an increase in dengue cases as stagnant water provides breeding grounds for mosquitoes. With these contributing factors in mind, Pineda-Cortel developed prediction models of dengue cases in four studied regions in the Philippines.[11]", "19619508": "Mark Stephen Ptashne (born June 5, 1940, in Chicago) is a molecular biologist.

Alcala is known for his fieldwork to build sanctuaries and to promote biodiversity in the aquatic ecosystems of the Philippines. He was the Chairman of the Board of Advisers at the Angelo King Center for Research and Environmental Management located in Silliman University.[1] Alcala published more than 200 peer-reviewed articles and books and his biological contributions to the environment and ecosystems have made him a renowned figure of natural sciences in the Philippines.[2]/nAlcala was born on March 1, 1929, in the municipality of Cauayan, Negros Occidental.[3] He was raised by a moderately low-income family in the small coastal town of Calling, Philippines. Alcala worked alongside his father who worked as a fisherman at the nearby agricultural fish ponds.[4] Due to his family's financial struggles, they depended on the ocean for its resources either[5] in providing food or items to sell./nIn 1951, Angel Alcala earned his bachelor's degree in biology (magna cum laude) from Silliman University. He then declined acceptance to the University of the Philippines College of Medicine in order to assist his family.[6] During that time, he occasionally assisted in biological fieldwork, for example for Sidney Dillon Ripley and Dioscoro Rabor in 1953 when they collected the only known (as of 2019) specimen of the Negros fruit dove. Alcala later attended Stanford University to complete his master's degree after 9 years. By 1966, he earned his Ph.D. in the same field and an honor doctorate from both the Xavier University and the University of Southeastern Philippines. Alcala later became a professor at Silliman University, where he also served as president for two consecutive years. He served as secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources from 1992 to 1995 and chairman of the Commission on Higher Education (CHEd) from 1995 to 1999.[7] He also served as consultant on marine and aquatic projects under the United Nations Environment Programme, World Bank, Asian Development Bank, World Bank Global Environment Facility, the Pew Fellowship in Marine Conservation, and the University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute./nAngel Alcala is accredited with many research accomplishments and improvements regarding environmental management, marine conservation, and discovery of new species. One of Alcala's works consisted of restoring or preserving areas with predominant wild,large predatory fish populations near a small marine sanctuary at Apo Island in the Philippines. His goal was to sustain hospitable conditions in this sanctuary throughout the duration of his research.[8] This sanctuary, called the Sumilon Marine Reserve, began as just an uninhabited area under 100 kilometers away from Apo Island.[9] Another research element Alcala incorporated in his study is associating the species\u2019 survival rate of large, predatory fish with available ocean territories around reefs and fisheries. This helped place an effort to set boundaries to distinguish marine sanctuaries and fishing areas. Alcala's conservation efforts accompanied by his research in oceanic and land management helped stabilize retention of once-endangered species in the Sumilon Island and Apo Island marine reserves.[10]/nHis studies correlated the efforts of protective environmental practices with the effects of either continuing or ceasing those regulations. Incidents of fishing are common consequences when ocean space and resources are available and not properly managed. These studies were primarily conducted near coral reefs of Sumilon Island located in the central Philippines. Alcala concluded how maximizing conservation and environmental efforts near these coral reefs reduced fishing and stabilized struggling fish species that faced the increased loss of habitat.[11]/nAngel Alcala experimented with his teams to conserve coral reefs and other marine resources. In their \"no-take\" experiment,[12] Alcala's team tested the mobility of fish species when humans were forbidden from fishing in these areas. By doing so, they discovered that the species abundance in the area declined while pushing the boundaries of their residence to further reaches. These findings provide evidence that conservation of these fishes and coral reefs not only slows the species' decline in numbers, but also the growth in habitat for all marine life.[13]/nAlcala has also worked to protect the lives of giant clams in the Philippines. He worked alongside Dr. Edgardo Gomez to assess the organisms' status in 1983. After thorough evaluation of Bolinao waters, they learned that the numbers were insufficient. Gomez and Alcala retrieved young giant clams from the Solomon Islands to breed back in Bolinao. After their work, the giant clam population has increased significantly to ensure that the ecosystem is stable.[14] On October 25, 2014, he visited the Semirara coast where he spoke in favor of saving giant clams.[15]/nAlong with his many other accomplishments, Angel Alcala's work has led to the discovery of 50 new species of reptiles and amphibians.[16] In other words, more than 10 percent of all reptiles and amphibians in the Philippines are known today because of Alcala's work.

She had the good fortune of being selected to participate in a high school expedition to the U.S. Virgin Islands to learn about field biology, and there cemented her desire to focus on the sea and the challenges to preserving its wonders. After studying at Wellesley and Dartmouth Colleges in New England (USA), she returned to the Virgin Islands to lead an Endangered Species Management Program in cooperation with the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Years later she returned to graduate school at the University of Rhode Island (URI), where she simultaneously worked towards her Master of Marine Affairs (specializing in fisheries management) and her Ph.D. in Biological Sciences (sea turtle population dynamics and genetics). While at URI she joined the nascent Coastal Resources Center, exporting US experience in coastal planning to developing countries. Agardy then went on to do a post-doc at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), and was a Marine Policy Fellow there for several years. It was while at WHOI that she began working with the multilateral institutions that would shape her interests and work in years to come: the Man and Biosphere Reserve Programme of UNESCO and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). The love of the sea that her husband Josh Spring and children Alex, Sophie, and Christopher all share is a continuing source of inspiration./nIn 1990, Agardy moved to Washington to work as Senior Scientist for World Wildlife Fund (WWF). At the time there was no formal marine program, but country programs were encouraged to do more in the marine conservation realm, and Agardy assisted in priority-setting, project design, and project execution, working in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Central America, and Europe. As much of this work centered on marine protected areas, she used the wealth of knowledge acquired in her experiences to write the acclaimed book \"Marine Protected Areas and Ocean Conservation\".[1]  During this time, Agardy also worked closely with IUCN field and headquarters programs, and chaired the Marine Advisory Group that guided the Union's marine conversation activities over multiple triennia. She later joined Conservation International to launch CI's Global Marine Program, and shortly thereafter founded Sound Seas, looking for ways to interface between the scientific community, the international policy arena, and the NGO and multilateral institutions relying on scientific information and policy frameworks in order to achieve effective marine conservation./nSound Seas began with small teams addressing the needs of philanthropic foundations to conduct evaluations and undertake strategic planning. Through Sound Seas Agardy conducted a strategic evaluation of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation\u2019s Population, Consumption, and Environment Program, and assisted the Oak Foundation in its early efforts to support marine protected area initiatives worldwide.  Agardy worked with colleagues to design the Coral Reef Targeted Research Project of the World Bank, and prepared a feasibility study for the institutional arrangement that supported it. Sound Seas explored the feasibility of establishing a research station on Palmyra Atoll for The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and conducted evaluations for the United Nations Development Programme in the Black Sea region, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) for its support of WWF climate change work in Cameroon, Fiji, and Tanzania, and International Financial Corporation (IFC) in its support of TNC work in Komodo, Indonesia. She is continuing to work with UNEP's Mediterranean Action Programme, coordinating an initial assessment of the Mediterranean Sea to promote the Ecosystem Approach in the region. This builds on the work she has done in marine protected areas, targeted marine research, and identification of ecologically important areas, in Italian waters and in the Mediterranean as a whole./nIn 2001, shortly after founding Sound Seas, Agardy began brainstorming with colleagues from the World Resources Institute about how to recognize the value of natural ecosystems for humanity. This led to her involvement with the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA), which in 2005 published the first global evaluation of the status of ecosystems in relation to human well-being. Agardy headed the coastal portion of this comprehensive assessment, and was co-author of the summary document \"Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: Biodiversity Synthesis\".[2]/nBuilding on experiences gained in promoting marine protected areas, policies aimed at marine biodiversity conservation, and integrated coastal and marine planning, Agardy published several books that continue to provide guidance for marine managers today. A co-authored publication entitled \"Biodiversity in the Seas\"[3] has been credited as spurring many marine conservation activities that followed the adoption of the Jakarta Mandate of the Convention on Biological Diversity, focusing world attention on the value and status of life in the seas. Her innumerable publications on marine protected area (MPA) and MPA network design, on science and information needs in planning, and on integrated or ecosystem-based marine management have helped to add rigor to the field of marine conservation. Her book \"Ocean Zoning: Making Marine Management More Effective\"[4] explores the tool of zoning in Marine Spatial Planning and integrated management more generally. Working through the Center for Biodiversity at the American Museum of Natural History, Sound Seas created several teaching modules on marine conservation biology, international treaties, and marine protected areas.  Her 2011 UNEP publication describes the core principles behind EBM and outlines steps to achieve it,[5] and this book serves as the basis for training and capacity building in various regions around the world, including in the Mediterranean Sea (through the Barcelona Convention and its Mediterranean Action Programme) and the Red Sea region (PERSGA)./nRecognizing the inadequate resource base that exists for doing marine management effectively around the world, Agardy joined Forest Trends in 2006 to explore innovative financing for marine conservation. The focus of the MARES (Marine Ecosystem Services) Program that she launched is on assessing the value of coastal and marine habitats for the myriad ecosystem services they provide, and identifying opportunities for Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES), offsets, or other market-like mechanisms to generate revenues that support conservation (and, very often, local communities that provide stewardship).[6]/nAgardy is Science and Policy Director at the World Ocean Observatory and writes on ocean issues for the organization's Ocean Observer. She is also Contributing Editor of MEAM (Marine Ecosystems and Management) - a publication on ecosystem-based management produced in association with the University of Washington (USA).[7]/nIn 2006, Agardy was selected to receive the University of Miami\u2019s Rosenstiel Award for Significant Achievement in Oceanography and Marine Policy. She was given the Civic Scientist of the Year Award by the Earthwatch Foundation in 1998, and the Secretary of State Open Forum Distinguished Public Service Award in the same year. The URI Alumni Association granted her the Award for Excellence in Research in 1996, and in 1995 she was selected by TIME Magazine as one of the fifty most promising young leaders in America.

Harper (Liz) is an evolutionary biologist known for her work on molluscs. She is an honorary fellow of the British Antarctic Survey and was accorded the title of Honorary Professor by the University of Cambridge in 2019./nHarper was born in Ipswich, Suffolk.[citation needed] She has a B.A. (and M.A Cantab) from the University of Cambridge and earned her doctorate from the Open University.[1] As of 2021, Harper is a professor at the University of Cambridge, and a fellow of Gonville and Caius college.[2] Harper has used the collections at the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences for her research, and she was made an honorary curator of the invertebrate paleontology in 2004, and has twice served as acting director of the museum.[3] In 2019, the University of Cambridge bestowed the title of Honorary Professor of Evolutionary Malacology on Harper.[4]/nAs of June 2023, Harper is the Director of Studies in Earth Sciences, as well as a College Lecturer,[5] at Gonville and Caius college./nHarper's research focuses on molluscan biology and biomineralization. Her early research used genome size in living organisms to infer genome size in fossils.[6] She has subsequently examined the process of biomineralization,[7] or how bivalves make cement,[8][9] how pteropods repair their shells,[10] and the factors controlling the shape of shells in blue mussels[11] and oysters.[12] She has defined the factors controlling feeding on molluscs by examining drilling into shells,[13][14] and worked on a collaborative project that considered multiple areas of research to define the origins of bivalves.[15] Harper's research includes investigations into how different species of molluscs may respond to future changes in water chemistry,[16][17] most recently revealing how brachiopods are able to alter the thickness of their shell under conditions that would lead to increased dissolution of their shells.[18] She has lectured at The Perse School on the origins of molluscs, and how shells can explain adaptions of organisms to the environment.[19]/nIn 1990, Harper received the President's Award from the Palaeontological Association.[20] As of 2021, Harper is named an honorary fellow of the British Antarctic Survey.[21]", "62775012": "Aurelia Skipwith is an American attorney, businesswoman, and biologist who served as the director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service from 2019 to 2021. She was confirmed by the Senate as director on December 12, 2019, by a 52\u201339 vote, and is the first black director of the Fish and Wildlife Service.[1]/nSkipwith was born and raised in Indianapolis, Indiana, the oldest of nine children. Skipwith's family eventually relocated to Columbus, Mississippi. Skipwith's father served in the United States Navy and United States Army Reserve. Her grandfather was a farmer in Mississippi.[2]/nSkipwith received a Bachelor of Science degree in biology from Howard University in 2003, a Master of Science in molecular genetics from Purdue University, and a Juris Doctor from the University of Kentucky College of Law.[3]/nSkipwith began her career at Monsanto in 2006 as a lab technician, and worked her way to a sustainable agriculture partnership manager.[4] Following her work at Monsanto, Skipwith completed law school and had a brief career as a research and legal intern at the United States Department of Agriculture.[5] She also served as an intellectual property consultant for the United States Agency for International Development.[5]/nFor a period of time, Skipwith worked at Alltech, an organization based in Nicholasville, Kentucky which specializes in animal nutrition and algae production. She later co-founded AVC Global, an agricultural supply blockchain company in early-2016.[6]/nFrom April 2017 to January 2020, Skipwith served as deputy assistant secretary fish, wildlife and parks of the Department of the Interior./nSkipwith served as the director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service starting in January 2020. Her appointment was widely supported by conservatives and opposed by environmentalists due to her ties to the pesticide industry and her support of the Trump administration's efforts to roll back environmental protections.[7] The Center for Biological Diversity stated \"Aurelia Skipwith has been working in the Trump administration all along to end protections for billions of migratory birds, gut endangered species safeguards and eviscerate national monuments. Skipwith will always put the interests of her old boss Monsanto and other polluters ahead of America's wildlife and help the most anti-environmental administration in history do even more damage.\"[8]/nUnder Skipwith's direction, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service generated controversy by not granting Monarch butterflies protection,[9] requiring entries in the Federal Duck Stamp Contest to include a hunting theme,[10] weakening rules against the killing of birds by oil and gas companies and others,[11] and massively reducing the protected habitat of threatened owls.[12]/nShe left office on January 19, 2021.[13]/nSkipwith Giacometto married Leo Giacometto, a former member of the Montana Legislature and chief of staff to former Senator Conrad Burns. Giacometto was a co-founder of AVC Global and who worked as a lobbyist in the agriculture sector.[14]", "8707821": "Thomas Sergeant Hall (23 December 1858 \u2013 21 December 1915) was an Australian geologist and biologist, recipient of The Murchison Fund in 1901.[1]/nHall was born in Geelong, the son of Thomas March Hall, a business man originally from Lincolnshire, England and Elizabeth, n\u00e9e Walshe, from Dublin. Hall was educated at the Geelong Grammar School where he came under the influence of James L. Cuthbertson. He was a junior master at Wesley College in 1879\u201380, then Hawthorn College and then went to the University of Melbourne, where he took his B.A. degree in 1886 with honours in natural science. This included work in palaeontology under Sir Frederick McCoy. Hall taught for a year at Girton College, Sandhurst (now Bendigo) in 1887, but returned to the university and did a three years' course in biology under Professor Sir Baldwin Spencer./nHall took a leading part in the forming of the university science club, and through it met Dr G. B. Pritchard with whom he was later to do valuable work in geology. Hall was a successful director of the Castlemaine school of mines from 1890 to 1893, and in the latter year became lecturer in biology at Melbourne university. Hall held this position until his death but found time for many other activities./nIn 1899 Hall published a Catalogue of the Scientific and Technical Periodical Literature in the Libraries of Victoria. A second and enlarged edition, in which he was assisted by Mr E. R. Pitt of the public library, Melbourne, appeared in 1911. He did much valuable work for the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria (president 1901\u20131903), the Royal Society of Victoria, and the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science. His Victorian Hill and Dale (1909), describing the geology of the country around Melbourne, is a model book of popular science, written without a trace of scientific jargon; there is barely a technical term in its 150 pages. He did not write a large number of papers, but his work on the graptolite rocks of Victoria led to his being made the recipient of The Murchison Fund of the Geological Society of London in 1901. One of his major discoveries was the key to the unravelling of the complex Ordovician sequence./nHe married Miss Eva Lucie Annie Hill on 21 December 1891, who survived him along with three sons and a daughter./nHall became ill early in 1915, but carried on his work until shortly before his death from chronic nephritis on 21 December 1915. He was given the honorary degree of D.Sc. by Melbourne University in 1908. Hall's work with Dr Pritchard on the tertiary fossiliferous strata of Victoria, and his own work on the graptolite rocks of Victoria gives him a permanent place in the history of Australian geology.", "23682801": "Horace Albert \"Nook\" Barker (November 29, 1907 \u2013 December 24, 2000) was an American biochemist and microbiologist who studied the operation of biological and chemical processes in plants, humans and other animals, including using radioactive tracers to determine the role enzymes play in synthesizing sucrose. He was recognized with the National Medal of Science for his role in identifying an active form of Vitamin B12./nBarker was born on November 29, 1907, in Oakland, California. He moved with his family to Palo Alto, California when he was 11 years old. He spent a year in Germany following high school, learning the German language and absorbing its culture. He attended Stanford University, graduating in 1929 with a bachelor's degree in physical science, and was awarded a Ph.D. in chemistry in 1933.[1]/nAfter graduating from Stanford, he performed a two-year postgraduate fellowship at the Hopkins Marine Station under the supervision of microbiologist C. B. van Niel, who fostered Barker's interest in botany and taught him techniques for isolating microorganisms. He then spent a year at the Delft Microbiology Laboratory in the Netherlands under Albert Kluyver.[1]/nBarker was hired in 1936 by the University of California, Berkeley to teach soil microbiology. He was part of a team that developed the use of Carbon-14 as a radioactive tracer, using the technique in 1944 to show how sucrose is synthesized in living cells by enzymes.[2]/nResearch led by Barker during the 1950s provided insights into the uses of vitamin B12 in the body using bacterium he had isolated from mud taken from San Francisco Bay. By 1959, through documenting the metabolic flow of the vitamin B12 coenzyme, Barker was able to show its role in the body, helping to explain various diseases, such as pernicious anemia, one of a series of conditions resulting from [[vitamin B12 deficiency]].[2] In a White House ceremony held on January 17, 1969, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson awarded Barker with the National Medal of Science \"[f]or his profound study of the chemical activities of microorganisms, including the unraveling of fatty acid metabolism and the discovery of the active coenzyme form of vitamin B12.\"[3]/nWhen the department of biochemistry was established in 1959, he was named as a professor there. He served as the department's chairman in the 1960s, and continued work there for more than a decade after retiring in 1975 when he became an emeritus professor. In 1953, he was elected a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences.[4] He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1967.[5]/nA resident of Berkeley, California, Barker died at age 93 on December 24, 2000, due to heart failure at his home there. He had been married for 62 years to his wife, the former Margaret McDowell, at the time of her death in 1995.[2]"}
